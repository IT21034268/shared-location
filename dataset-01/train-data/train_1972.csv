1,probably worst dylan album I spent money on,"There are some great lyrics on Silvio, and Ninety Miles an Hour and Rank Strangers to Me are very cool... but there is no cohesion to the album. Feels like Dylan was trying to make a few bucks by getting popular backup musicians. I got rid of it promptly. Much better bet is Infidels (my favorite) or Oh Mercy."
1,substandard book,"This is a substandard book in ethics and quite mediocre. It makes huge assumptions and provides no explanations for concepts such as ""human nature"" (the was ""man"" is supposed to be) --->eh? Quite boring and intellectually dispicable. The christian preaching is quite unbearable for any serious reader familiarized with decent works in ethics. Ah... and comments such as ""you ought never betray your country"" just put me over the edge. I would give it -5 stars if I could!"
2,"LARGE glass.. and only one glass, not a set","This glass is advertised as a port glass, and I must say, that cannot be true. This is a very large glass! It is well made, but defeats the purpose I intended it for.Also, I guess it was dumb of me to assume that they were selling a set, but I did, since most of the other glasses listed are sold as sets. It is just one glass.I will be returning this item."
5,great gift,My daughter is a sponge with this kind of stuff... she is really enjoying the hot dots games. Great gift. fast shipping
2,Try one of Merril's other books instead,"Merrill Markoe is a very funny author - but I do not recommend this book. It's like ""Merrill Light"" very watered down and never fills you up. Try one of her other books instead - or find this at your local library."
4,early childhood fantasy dragon,"While the toy comes with a hefty price tag it sure is a great deal nicer in quality and craftsmanship then others I have compared it to. The dragon resembles several in childhood story books. I use it as a prop at the preschool, although, my own grandson keeps trying to take it home. Guess I might have to purchase another."
3,small means handy but limited,"I took this book to Thailand in 1999 with the full knowledge that it does not contain all the birds that I would most likely encounter, but its handy size and weight did fit the bill.Unfortunately, it seemed that half the birds I saw weren't in the book, but maybe that was just my luck. In addition, due to space constraints, geographical distribution descriptions were vague, so I was left wondering if the sunbird I saw was the one pictured or it was another similar one mentioned but not pictured nor fully described.Instead, I relied on a fat book available from a publisher in Bangkok (written in English) that both my hotel hostess and my hired guide used in Chiang Mai.All in all, this small guide is good if you have concerns about weight and space and don't mind not knowing what species of sunbird you're looking at. It's also good for getting a general idea of the variety of Thai bird species."
5,The truth about sewing machines!,"I got this book a couple of years ago when I wanted to update my sewing machine. (The 1960 Singer had about 160,000 miles on it.) The book showed me how to recognize quality in a sewing machine, and convinced me that the precision European machines from the days before computers are the real gems. I bought two of the high-rated ones, for far less than I would have spent on a new machine. I love them both - I am so glad this information was available."
3,Beginner Level Book,"I collect antique sewing machines. My newest one is a 1966 Singer 221 Featherweight. When I got this book, I gave it to my son who is just learning to sew. It was written in terms he could understand and had a lot of practical knowledge in it. For me, it was of no use. I have been sewing since age 11 and have taught myself most everything I know about machines. So, if you are just starting out, this is a great book. If you are an antique sewer like me, find another book like Charles Law's Encyclopedia of Antique Sewing Machines (limited print and hard to find). He tells you how to restore a black japanned finish with gold leaf without destroying the surface, what chemicals to use and not to use, and has many manuals for obsolete machines in the back of the book with diagrams."
5,"A comprehensive, well-written guide to the market.","Mr. Giordano has done an excellent job of leading consumers though the confusing maze of today's sewing machine market. Easy to read, educational and entertaining. Recommended highly if you are interested in becoming educated in the sophisticated world of sewing machines. An unexpected bonus - he's funny! Anyone would be well advised to purchase this book before buying."
2,Silly book...,"This is an ok book for TIPS here and there, but really lame in every other way. My favorite silly piece of advice is when he says to go ahead and rub perfume on your machine to make it smell pretty. Sewing temperment? Insulting, and a waste of paper. I really tried to like the book."
1,Don't Bother!!!,"I don't need a book that only talks about how to justify your sewing machine purchase - and wastes numerous pages with ways to know whether you should or should not ""splurge"" when you visit your local sewing machine store.I was hoping this book would get into discussing the different features of various manufacturers - and the pros and cons of different machine types, but this info was sorely lacking.If you're looking for a home, computer machine and need someone to hold your hand before you feel okay to buy one, then you'll love this book."
3,remakes and radio edits,"It's my own fault for not paying attention and previewing every song before i bought this, but i'm pretty disappointed in this compilation. I love BLH, but this disc is full of sub-par remakes, remixes, and radio edits that are not even close to as good as the originals. I'd recommend just getting the full original albums over this purchase, unless you already have them and are looking for radio remixes. But come on - a Brotha Lynch Hung song without a single cuss word??? That's an abomination!"
5,"chiseled in stone,vern gosdin-10 yearsof greatest hits-vern gosdin","Both of these cd.s were ordered from a private seller thru amazon. Both already recieved and just as I expected are great Vern Gosdin recordings. I will order again, also Country Classics Vol.5,Chiseled In Stone,Super Hits Of The 70,s Have A Nice Day,Ten Years of Hits all by vern gosdin, some of the most wonderful music I have heard, and the excellant people who sent to me, because amazon , did not have were the most talented of all. They were sent in greatest condition,fast service, packing so nothing would break, these people are the greatest, thank you and amazon.Gayle Monett Chico, Texas"
5,Downbeat country should appeal to George Jones fans,"Like George, Vern sometimes sings more upbeat material (Tight as twin fiddles, on this album, being a prime example), but both singers have a particular way with the kind of very sad songs that dominate this album, especially the title track.For those who are unfamiliar with it, the title refers to the inscription on a gravestone and the song points out that don't understand loneliness until somebody you love has died. It is the kind of song that you expect to hear George Jones sing, but I doubt if George could improve on Vern's version of this song.Tight as twin fiddles, the one upbeat track here, is a slice of western swing in the tradition of Bob Wills. Of the other songs, all of which are excellent, my favorites are Do you believe me now and Set em up Joe.If you enjoy traditional country with absolutely no frills, this is for you. Just be sure to have those tissues ready."
1,What they dont tell you in product description.,No where in the product description do the tell you that this item has a dual pin connector. I had to order it to find this out and of course I need a single pin connector.This is why I am only giving this only one star. As far as weather or not it works good I obviously can not comment on.
1,I need a single wire pluging like cellphone(earphone),"I really wanted a single wire pluging than the two pluging that you sent to me ,is any possibility of a single pluging to connect to the clesr wire tubing. The product is of good grade I like it so much but I will love more if I could get it."
1,not what I wanted. . . at first,"These only work with Midland radios. I don't have Midland radios, I have Motorola.I just wish I knew before I got them.Update:I recently bought some midland radios, and was finally able to test these out. I haven't done any full day field testing, But they seem to be pretty good. They fit well, the mic picks up easily, and a speaker is clear.I'm leaving my one start just for people will actually see my review.This product as plenty of 5 start anyway :)"
1,Not for PR400,"This item seemed very promising....until I tried to plug it into my service Motorola PR400 two way radio. The prongs are too wide appart, had to return it. So better be sure of the compatibilty with your radio model!"
4,working unit with gloves,use this for Airsoft games and find the button is hard to use with standard game gloves. these are of type Mechanix thickness. if not using gloves the button works wonderfully. suggested use is for non-glove activities... :) audio quality is very good.
3,Midland AVPH3 Treansparent Security Headset,"This head setMidland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX (Pair)could be better if the coiled around the head section were longer to assist with keeping the ear bud in the ear canal. The mounting clip for the voice unit needs to be more user friendly for right or left side clip on (perhaps a larger clip as well would help). The unit has good sound clarity. If your choice of a headset is this or a ""hard shell over the ear holder type or a headphone style which closes off both ears, I would purchases the AVDP set again). Amazon has the better price on this unit and timely shipping."
5,Great for Po' Mans Secret Service.,I use these for Weddings so I know when to play the Wedding March or bring in the Wedding Party. They work great BUT since they go IN your ear I would not SHARE these with someone else. (Ewwww)
5,Very Good Quality,I am a geocacher and i use these when i go with other people to help us communicate. the sound quality in these are amazing and i would reccomend these for anyone
4,Much more comfortable than the standard issue,"I ordered these to replace the standard earpieces that came with the Midland radios. The earpiece is extremely comfortable, and the sound quality is good. The microphone leaves something to be desired, especially when using VOX mode. I found I had to speak directly into the mike at close range rather than speak normally with it clipped to my clothing six inches away.Still, it's a great improvement over the uncomfortable setup that comes with the radios."
4,Good price and quality,The price is reasonable and the quality is good. Shipping time is also reasonable.
4,survellance earpiece,Being in the Security Business I have found this to be very helpful tool...compfortable to wear and mostly hands free.
3,Midland Headsets,I really like these headsets. They work pretty well. I use it when I go snowboarding and they fit. Great for use in security and when you need to keep your hands free. I really like the function of not having to press the talk button to talk. Just speaking turns it on!
3,Not Compatable,These headsets by Midland were recommended by Amazon (other coustomers) when I purchased a set of Uniden 2-Way radios. Do not waste you time. The headsets are not compatable with Uniden Radios. The Radios use a single pin plug whil the headsets are dual pin. Amazon needs to remnove the recommendation due the fact that they won't work together.I would have kept them if they had worked. They appeared to be very well made and exactly what I was looking for but that didn't do me any good.
2,They don't fit motorola,I guess it's my fault for not vetting the product well enough. These things are throw aways anyhow. I sure it would've broke like my others
1,I don't believe this is the Midland brand,"First, I thought I was ordering a pair but only received one. Second, this did not fit my Midland GXT1000VP4. Pins did not match radio, therefore, they were worthless to me. When I contacted the vendor they inplied they would correct the issue but haven't done it yet. If they do then I will make an amendment to this review."
3,fairly good product,"I've had to replace these earphones several times, because after using them for a few weeks the electronics fail and you can no longer communicate. They work fine, when they work. If I had another option for the Midland radios I would choose it."
2,"Nice design, but couldn't hear clearly","After reading all the rave reviews I decided to buy the clear headsets as it looked less obvious than the microphone headsets I was using as a wedding coordinator. I used it for the first time last week and none of my staff could hear each other. Because we work in loud environments, I thought this one would be great since security guards at bars & clubs tend to use the clear headsets. We tried adjusting everything including placement, holding the mic covered and close, but still it was so quiet that we couldn't hear each other. We decided to go back to the headset mics just to test and it worked perfectly loud & clear. Maybe I just received a bad set."
4,Perfect Accessory for my 2-ways,"I decided to purchase the transparent headsets because I didn't want to look too obvious that I was wearing a headset. The headset itself looks cheap and flimsy, but it has proven to be sturdy and put together well. Best of all, the sound quality is excellent as long as you give your mouth about an inch or so of distance from the mike. My only complaint is that the earpiece seems to be designed to fit in the right ear; if you put the earpiece in the left it has a tendancy to slip and rotate out of the ear every once in a while. Altogether an excellent value."
4,very satisfied,I have been very satisfied with this headset purchase. They have worked well for my hunting endeavors.
3,It's Okay,The mic and shirt clip works pretty good. The ear piece is to stiff so it does not stay on your ear long when doing moderate activities. It is a constant adjustment of the ear piece to keep it around the ear. The ear piece is clearly audible.
4,Great Headset,"Works great, but small earbud portion often comes out of ear otherwise this is a better alternative to the headsets that come with the radios."
3,Does not show which PLUG it has,"My fault for ordering this product not knowing which plug it has. I needed a single 2.5mm plug and this particular product has a dual pin plug. The item description does not state which plug it has, and of course i also failed to ask. the product was shipped in a timly manner, but I just have never gotten to use it cuz it was wrong. 3 stars for poor description only. Im sure this product probaby works great, But i do not know."
2,Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX are a disappointment,Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX.I was expecting more from a premier communications gear manufacture; I didn't get it. The VOX capability on this headset is useless. In order to get the VOX function to work at all you have to have the gain turned all the way up while holding the microphone within an inch or less from your mouth. This defeats the whole propose I purchasing this headset for. The headset works fine for PPT but that's not what I wanted them for.
3,Does NOT work with Cobra radios,"Looks great, but it has a two-pin connector, which doesn't work with Cobra or other brands of two-way radios that use a single-pin earpiece connection. Just so you know..."
1,Not what I expected and did not receive refund.,"I purchased these items in 2011. They were not the right ones for devices I purchased; therefore, I imediately, returned them. To this day, I have not received a refund."
2,OK,"I found that this head set is more comfortable than most, but the microphone is terrible, people have a very hard time hearing me."
2,"Good communication, not always dependable.","The clarity and minimal amount of bleed when communicating through these headsets is amazing. I have only had one problem with these. In PTT mode, once in a while, halfway through the night, they decide for some reason not to work and I have to switch the headsets to VOX, then I have to press the button on the actual radio to talk... Very strange. I plan on contacting Midland about this problem."
2,Midland earpiece headset,"the earplug not fitting correctly, transmiting not clear and broken up.had to turn the volume to maximum inorder to hear. good style but need to improve quality."
3,You get what you pay for.,"For $10ish a piece, these are pretty good. But, you get what you pay for. The ear piece fit is okay and the volume has to be turned up all the way when outside or in a noisy environment. If it gets too loud, it can be quite difficult to hear. The one major blunder is that the wire from the ear piece to the mic is way too short! I wish it was at least 6-12 inches longer. Midland probably had 10 year olds in mind when they designed this product. This headset is a nice little toy that works very well for what you pay. Obviously, I would never actually use this for any type of security job."
3,Not for the Uniden Radios,I have nothing against the headsets because we didn't use them. I am posting this because this was a purchase that was reccomended with the uniden radios. They are made for midland radios(2 prong adapter)and will not work the uniden (micro 1 prong).
1,Headset,Product did not work. Very frustating. NO clear instructions. Hard to hear voice transmissions. I bought this for use on a boat when docking. The voice activation cut off after 4 seconds.
2,Not very loud,"Find that its not very loud in places where you need to hear, and thats the whole idea of these ear pieces so I thought."
4,look+sound awesome!,They work great with my new walkie-talkies and also transmit great sound to one another! Just plug them in and they work!
3,Good but could be louder,I like these headsets.. they are comfortable and very easy to use.. the two issues i found are as follows:1) They could be a bit louder.. i use them in a loud setting and have to really focus to make out what others are saying2) The wire to the mic could be longer. I am 6'2 so i feel the wire pulling when i set up the mic on my suit jacket.Other wise these are pretty solid.
5,VERRY GOOD,Verry nice i love it is verry good for your ears my sons loved it to and my wify said there is your new toy..
2,Not working correctly,"My friend bought a set of these off amazon and I borrowed them to use while hunting. Hers worked great, I bought a set of my own and they do not. I can hear anyone else on the radio through the ear bud, but when i push the PTT button to talk back to them, all they hear is static. Not happy with this purchase. Might try another set, might not, debating at this time. Two stars was because the clarity of the ear bud only."
3,"well, okay...","actually the book is more than okay, i guess. i really love the science fiction part, the sword with a housed entity, a flying, homing creature...very creatively illustrated. the only problem is the story line. it's SOOOOO predictable. i know how the book will end way before i got through halfway."
4,Beneath a Crimson Moon,I loved the fast paced excitement and the continuation of the story. Nobody likes to get to the end of a story they really enjoy and left hanging. Perhaps it is a little too predictable but still very enjoyable. Christine really knows how to make her characters come alive and her writing is easy to follow without confusion. I would buy another continuation of this series if available.
1,A waste of money!!!,"I was on a trip and my ipod cords shorted out, so i bought this transmitter... and I have to say that everything about it SUCKS!!1. The shape is really the least thought out thing ever! It is this big round (!?!?) honking knob hanging off the top of your mp3 player, with flops from side to side.2.It eats batteries for breakfast!! You will go through $50 worth of AAA's in a years so you may as well save yourself the money and get a real one.3. The presets are not easy to figure out, it is total trial and error to which one you are on, plus you will NEVER get a clear signal. NEVER EVER EVER!!!Trust me, this is the worst product of all time... it even bets ""My Pet Rock""."
1,You get what you pay for,Maxell Universal FM TransmitterBought the product based on pretty good performance of what must be just a little better model. This one only lasted about a month with only moderate use and simply stopped working. Put new batteries in...nothing. I will spend a bit more next time and hope to get a more reliable product.
4,FM Transmitter,"Very easy to use and very good quality of sound for the price, however uses batteries rather quickly. Might try using ""AAA"" rechargable one to see how they perform."
2,It works but the antenna is easily broken,"I got this a the CVS drug store years ago for a cheaper price than advertised here. There are 4 broadcast FM stations to select on the transmitter (88.1, 88.3, 88.5, 88.7). When traveling long distances between Maryland, DC, and VA I have to switch around to a clear and unused broadcast station. This is vexing."
2,Disapointing Results - Not Recommended,"The Maxell FM Transmitter seemed like a good solution to get handsfree car use for my older cell phone and Zen MP3 player. Since this connects into the headphone jack, it can be used on any device that accepts the mini-connector.We tried two of these devices and, sadly, the poor range and intermittent performance made these an unusable option in my car, none of the 4 stations worked. I did try it in our house and confirmed that it could work if placed right next to a radio (both units), but not if it was moved more that 2 or three feet away.This might work well for some folks, but I gave mine away. Not Recommended."
1,This guy needs a creative writing class,"I couldn't stand this book. The short stories had endings anyone could see coming from the first couple pages (a little twist at the end, please?!?). Doesn't even compare with Stephen King or Thomas Harris for creepiness or suspense. And he uses the same tired, cliche-ridden phrases over and over. Not for those who actually care about the quality of what they read. I've read better from 8th graders."
5,"Kittens.... If nothing else, KITTENS!","If this book consisted only of the short story KITTENS, I would still recommend it, no matter the cost. When I reached the ending of that story, I was so frightened, I literally threw the book across the room, just like you might see in a horror movie or something. The other stories in the collection were great, but Kittens is one that showed a dark side to Koontz I had never seen before. I enjoyed that extra dark look into his soul... If you pick this book up, you simply MUST read KITTENS!"
4,"Interesting, frightening, well-written!!!","Dean Koontz really deserves credit for his writing skills. In a way, he writes like Stephen King, but unlike King, the beginnings of his books are more interesting which proves it's worth a read. The first story of the book is absolutely brilliant. I don't think it could have been written better. On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed the length of some of the other stories. They weren't long enough. It's the only bad point I could think of. Still, this shouldn't stop you from getting this one!"
5,Outstanding collection of Dean Koontz's work!,This book had Dean Koontz's older material which was exciting and kept you at the edge of your seat throughout each story as well as the (2) short novels that were contained in this collection. I am an avid follower of Mr. Koontz's books and highly recommend this one if you haven't read it yet.
3,only one high point!,"I gave this book a low rating because of the short stories. They are plain, to say the least, and not very inticing. The outcome of the shorter stories is always known before the story is finished. But what dropped this book AT LEAST 2 points is that most of the stories leave you hanging. I thought to myself after incountering one of these ""Where is the rest of it?"". I did find something that sparked interest in my mind though. The story called ""Strange Highways"". It is the only one I re-read.If you have the time to read something mildly interesting, read this. If you have a life to attend to, don't"
5,DK at his best,"This collection of 14 stories including 2 novellas absorbed me from the beginning. All have a certain measure of suspense. Some genuine surprise endings occur particularly in ""Hardshell"". Paticular standouts are ""Kittens"", ""Down in the Darkness"", ""Strange Highways"", ""Chase"", and ""The Twilight of the Dawn""."
4,"Great Book, and I don't read Koontz!","I thought that this book was very original. My favorite story in the book is Kittens. I don't read Dean Koontz, but my uncle kept telling me about Strange Highways while he was reading it and I was so intrigued that I bought it. I really enjoyed it and I couldn't put it down. I would recommend it to any one who loves the stranger things in life."
1,Ghastly and obscene,"Biography -- Biography St. Francis of AssisiI purchased this video intending to use it in a college class as an example of renewal movements within the Catholic church which led to outreach and missionary activity. Instead I found during the first 20 minutes repeated images of a scantily-clad contemporary woman wearing a g-string and at one point removing her top. I confess I couldn't watch any more. Francis's visionary experiences were presented as a result of his self-deprivation of food, sleep and long periods of standing up. If I could return this video I would. It was a total waste of money and not up to A&E;'s usual standards. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,sparkling silver,I purchased this silverware becasue it never needs polishing and it looks like i spent hours polishign it when I set the table even though I didn't touch it. I love it and recommend it to all my friends. I am purchasing this for a friend that just moved into a brand new apartment.
5,onieda colonial boston stainless steel flatware,"Awesome! I bought this set about 5 years ago & it's held up very well, still looks brand new. It goes with practically any type of table you could ever set, casual to formal. It's a classic design that won't ever go out of style, at least in my book. I highly recommend it."
1,false advertising by Amazon.com,December 2008 I purchased 2 sets of the Oneida Colonial Boston 20-Piece Stainless Steel Flatware. The discription that Amazon gave was that it ws 18/8. When they were received the flatware was 18/0. To say the least I was very disappointed in the quality. I would not buy anything from Amazon again because I do not fell I can trust the discriptions of their products. I do not appreciate bait and switch tactics. I do not have the time to keep returning items because they are not what Amazon claims they are. I rated this as 1 star because I could not rate it without at least 1 star. I would give it a 0
4,Not Exactly The Same,"I was adding to the set of Colonial Boston that I bought years ago. The quality is still good, but the shape is slightly different."
4,"Second verse, same as the first","I bought these to go with Colonial Boston flatware that we already owned. I'm always a little concerned when I buy something like this through the mail that it will not match what I already own, and that the quality will be worse. But these exactly matched what we already owned (purchased maybe 8 years ago?) and the quality was just as I hoped it would be."
1,"Oneida Colonial Boston 45-Piece Set, Service for 8","I bought this product and it is totally different than the picture. It has a two tone dis-coloration to it, that...in my opinion looks unfinnish or defective. Quite frankly, it sucks. So I returned it and now looking for something else.Oneida Colonial Boston 45-Piece Set, Service for 8"
1,Low quality. The knives rust.,Two of the four knives rusted almost immediately. The forks and spoons are ok so far. Either the knives are built poorly or a low grade of stainless steel is being used.
3,It's just ok...,"This helmet was just ok for the money...I didn't like the ""sticker"" that was on the side of the helmet. I think it made it look cheap."
3,Very Enjoyable,"I listened to the audio version of this book. It was an enjoyable ""read"" with a twist at the end. I appreciated the descriptions of Italy. Carrie Stone is a bit too trusting and at times a little unbelievable. I also wish that Ms. Crane would have developed some of the characters a little more. The romantic scenes in the book remain relatively romantic and don't become too bawdy. Overall, it was a good book and well written. I would recommend it and I plan to read additional works by Ms. Crane."
4,Acting Sucks... Some Good Skin...,There's a good sexual scene around the 38 min mark. The actors are pretty bad and the story ends up being really stupid. I would have liked to have seen more nudity from some of the other 'clients'. Overall a decent skin flick.
2,eh,"A shallow concept cannot be re-told as a great drama, regardless of the number of hotties you have on the backlot looking for their breakI'd give it two rotten tomatoes for weak writing, and stiff (intended ) dialogue."
5,The Second Half IS Better!,"The Arps must have been secretly watching our home when they wrote this book. Their comments on the changes in relationships and priorities were right on the mark. My wife and I have applied several of their ""challenges"" and the positive difference has been very noticeable. I enjoyed the book so much, it's become the background for a popular class I teach to ""empty nesters"" in our church.If your ""nest"" is empty now, or will be in the near future, you owe it to yourself and your marriage to read ""The Second Half of Marriage"". I doubt there is a better book on the subject available today."
2,Unexpected inferiority,"My Audioengine A5 speakers came w/ a cheap 6 ft. mini audio cable and I've had no problems to date save for its short length (for my needs). Crystal clear. This cable, however, is cursed w/ annoying pops and channel dropoff. In all fairness it appears to be on one end of the cord but unless it is held perfectly still (impossible w/ an iPod in hand) it is useless. It will be returned.Additional update: Replacement cable had same issues."
1,cable was DOA,"They simply don't work. Got mono instead of stereo when I was lucky, but usually nothing. Sad, shoddy merchandise."
1,Cable was DOA,Tried connecting cable from my sound card on my PC to my speakers and it just buzzes and pops. I've tried other shorter cables and they worked fine.
2,I'v had better.,"Seems somewhat loser then all the other AUX cords I have had and there is a bit of buzzing, nothing to crazy but if your turn our system all the way up while these are plugged in and nothing is playing, you will hear some fuzz."
3,WATCH OUT - this box has wrong track on disc 2,"I've written glowing reviews of UM/Hip-O's 3 box set series of the complete Bob Marley & Wailers - what an incredible job they did gathering every known track and dub from 1966-1972.(the other 2 sets are ""Grooving Kingston 12"" and ""Fy-ah Fy-ah"") BUT, this set unfortunately has a track on disc 2 (This Train)listed as the Pouder Version that is actually the Wail'n'Soul'm Version that already apperared on disc 1! I e-mailed UM about this and was told to return my set to them for a new one - when I did, I got back one with the same mastering mistake and a promo cut thru the bar-code. What a drag that they messed up such a great set."
1,WTF?,"Let me first say I love the MST version. Now, why did the rest of you people give this movie a good review? This movie is the biggest turd of a movie I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT IS HORRIBLE!!!The only movie to be worse than this is MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE."
5,"Hmmm, I'm so torn between loving this movie and burning it.","Well I'm gonna go ahead and guess that everyone seeing this movie has seen the MST3k version, but the movie itself can be viewed without those witty quips. Enjoy the soup scene. Thrill as Fingal drinks his reconst and Appolonia eats Flav-o-fives. Cry as the Renfield-like henchman of Rick dies in a hail of gunfire from the Fatman. Perhaps everyone should see Overdrawn at the Memory Bank just so we can all have some common terror in which we can all associate."
3,Too little ink,These cartridges only lasted about three months with very moderate usage. I don't think that they put enough ink in them for the high price that you have to pay - almost as much as an entire new printer!
4,HP Print Cartridge,"Buying HP Cartridges from Amazon.com online is very acceptable, do not have to make a trip to Walmart,with these items delivered to your door, and it is the same cartridge you buy anywhere."
3,Ink Quality,"The shipping and everything was great, and it was definitely cheaper to buy two inks in one package. But the quality of the color ink was not good. It was like it had already been used. Even after cleaning the heads on my printer, the color ink cartridge was still very faded looking."
1,Refurbish?,This product is sold as new but I think is refurbish because I've got two of the same color if you purchase this item make sure is a black and a color.I realize it when I need to change the black ink by then it was too late to return plus it would have cost me the shipping at the end I would have end up paying what it cost at the store.
3,HP Printer Cartridge,"it was a new product that I needed pretty quick but I thought it was a little expensive. Normally, I would pay less if I didn't need it so quickly!"
4,Change of Heart,"I am changing my review after speaking with the seller. He was very honest and helpful. It turns out it was a mistake that he was unaware of, however he was willing to stand behind his word. So I will definitely buy from him in the future. I love to support people of integrity."
4,You'll Want to Listen to the Whole Disc.,This is a great disc by a great vocalist with a powerful voice. It's full of hits and songs you know. This is a disc you listen to from start to finish. Put it in and let it play!
5,Best music this artist ever produced,I think his music is epic and he wrote most of the songs. Listing to the lyrics lets you know that he is a genius.
4,As Yet Untitled!?,"In the present time in music where looks are more of an attribute than actual talent, I take you music lovers back to 1987 with TTD's debut. Terence Trent D'arby writing is a deep as the religion of love could be throughout this lp. ""Sign Your Name"", if you haven't heard is more like a poem of attraction that calmly surrounds you with it's production and vocals. He also remade the hit written by Smokey Robinson performed by the Jackson 5. ""Who's Lovin' You"" isn't so bad, even though you can still hear the young Michael Jackson singing. Even when he's begging on ""If You Let Me Stay"", TTD captures emotions that are necessary for convincing. With this debut that was written, co-produced and arranged by himself, you can feel the arrogance in each title. I can't conclude without informing of the accapella ""As Yet Untitled"". Name the last artist (singer) who had an accapella song? ""...I called on God, but he was sleeping on that day..."" Y'all don't hear me."
5,TTD's Finest Hour,"This album is just a pleasure to listen to. I've heard of people tryin to bring TTD down because of his off-the-wall personality, but once you get past all that and get to the stuff that he's known for in general, which is his brilliant synthesis of various musical styles into a captivating, soulful mix, one could really care less. There's not one bad cut on this album and as far as I'm concerned, it's as good as it's gonna get from a debut album, PERIOD. So keep your hypocritical opinions to yourself and pick this album up. You'll be doing yourself a considerable favor for a change."
4,a great jump in the past,"very good one, famous pieces that are by now difficult to listen to the radio, no agreement that ruins original atmospheres"
2,Broad overview,"I thought this book's information was too general on both backpacking and photography, without enough detail to either improve my photography or backpack with a higher level of safety and fun. It might be helpful for someone who has never backpacked with a camera, but not someone with even a little bit of experience with backpacking and photography."
5,Indispensable for anyone hitting the photo trail,"This was an inspirational read for a lapsed outdoor photographer getting back on the trail. The gear recommendations have been right on so far and I continue to find creative gems every time I pick it up. This book will get you burning a lot of Velvia so just buy it, OK?"
5,Most valuable book ever written on nature photography.,"Although I am not an avid backpacker, my photography club recommended this book and I must say that it's my favorite photography book. I take it with me on every photo trip. It's tattered and torn from use and I will have to buy another one before long. Congratulations to Mr. Campbell for writing a clear and concise book. I know understand exposure."
3,[based upon samples] the late '60s band,"Songlist looks inviting but no vocals following the title tune, which is the hit single, in one piece; COLD SWEAT and GIVE IT UP... are the hit record backing tracks with overdubs; USE YOUR MOTHER is a music bed for JB and Bobby Byrd on different records, and AFTER YOU DONE IT, sounds like a music bed for Marva Whitney and Hank Ballard releases.Still, any JB from that classic period, is, well, Classic."
5,his best album yet,This is a compilation of different songs from famous artists. This is a must have album and one of the bestI have heard from Dany Brillant. It is mostly dance music and a wonderful album.
5,MASTER QUEST,"I love this season of Pokemon and I wish that Viz would work on releasing seasons 3,4,7,and 8. This is a must have for a hardcore fan of the anime series and I want this set."
1,"Good show, awful picture quality.","Anywho who knows anything about DVDs knows that the standard dual layered disc has the capacity to hold 4 hours worth of material. So what happens when you put 12 25 minute episodes on one disc? Terrible picture compression. It's bad, very distracting. A times, the picture is pixellated the compression is that bad. And why> Because Viz are cheap. If this had been a six disc set instead, there would be no problems!"
1,Worst Patterson Ever,"I am sooooooo sorry that I didn't read the reveiws before I purchased this book, but I'm such a James Patterson fan that I bought it just because. Big mistake! One star because the church plot was interesting, although I figured out one of the culpits after the hostage negotiating started. I'm very disappointed."
5,Anthoer Hit From James Patterson,"I admit, I am biased - I have loved nearly EVERY James Patterson novel I have picked up. Step On A Crack is no exception - it kept me going from beginning to end.A police officer with a gaggle of children, a sick wife and a mystery of his own to solve. I was trying to figure it out from the beginning and didn't get it until nearly the end.James Patterson never fails to thrill - hopefully we will see more of MIke"
4,a bit of a surprise!,"After being very critical of the last few co-authored Pattersons, ""Step on a Crack"" was not nearly as disappointing as I expected. Stronger charcters and a much better plot saves it. I still see how the short chapters and large print pad the book, but since that seems to be standard for a long time I'll let it pass.Assemby line novels are usually very formulaic and for once this doesn't have that heavy handed feel so it was much more enjoyable to read and I recommend it with only the above caution. It is a one or two sitting read, but worth the effort."
2,Very superficial book!,"I've read some other James Patterson novels and found some quite entertaining and an easy read but this one was no good. Honestly, I didn't care for the writing style. The sentences don't flow nicely at all and there's no depth of story or character. There are much better writers out there such as Michael Connelly and Stuart Woods. Don't waste your ""short"" time on this one!"
3,It's a James Patterson Novel,"STEP ON A CRACK is a typical James Patterson novel: short chapters, fast pace, twists, multiple points of view, hooking sentences, and so on. James Patterson has created a successful formula for writing suspenseful thrillers and has applied that formula to this book.Quite honestly, I couldn't put this book down; but then why the 3-star rating? Well, like other reviewers have mentioned, this isn't, simply put, Patterson's best novel. The man is a book factory and he has written far better, far more in-depth books. But still, I enjoy the fast pace and short chapters and multiple points of view. These aspects really engage the reader to read more. However, Patterson lacks the plot- and character-depth one could find in his Alex Cross novels.For a level of reference, for which to judge my 3-star rating of STEP ON A CRACK, I think James Patterson's novel ALONG CAME A SPIDER is an example of a 5-star Patterson book."
3,Churn a new one quickly,"I've read just about every Patterson book. Is he just putting his name on some and are the co-authors (so many now it's almost impossible to count) actually doing all the writing? I wonder if he even reads the books that go out on his name. It seemed as though the writer(s)??? had difficulty getting into the plot. Once they got to it I thought the book and story was pretty well developed, although the sentimentality inserted into the book in the midst of a suspenseful section kind of deflated the story line. The end of the book was horrible. It just so happens that an convict could vaguely remember the guards voice. Instead of developing any suspense for the search of the kidnappers and the leaders, they skip right to the close and arrest in what seemed to be a demand by the publisher to finalize as the deadline for the publication was past. Disappointed."
1,Softer Side of Patterson,"Wish I would have read these reviews before I spent my money, I would have started it and finished it at the bookstore, too. How Patterson and Ledwidge managed to get this book front and center at every bookstore is beyond my ken. Masters at marketing? Two talented authors could have, should have, done better!I've read just about all of Patterson's novels, loved them all, love Alex Cross, but my favorites were Beach Rd and Cradle and All. I've come to expect a certain level of emotion when I pick up a new Patterson novel, but this thriller was about as thrilling as watching a rerun of the Brady Bunch, Mary Catherine being about as believable as Alice."
2,MEDIOCRE,"I don't know when I will learn my lesson and just STOP reading Mr.Patterson's books... the last few have been so humdrum, run-of-the-mill, DULL books!!!!Don't waste your time."
2,A very disappointing new character,"I was very disappointed in this book. Patterson had an opportunity to create a fresh character, but instead he just wrote Alex Cross again. His relationships and personality seemed like carbon copies. Although the story line was an interesting one, I thought the villian was extremely uncreative. The OCD behavior of the villian was so stereotypical and added nothing to the story, but in fact made him comical. I would recommend skipping this one."
3,Not as great as those in the past,This book is an entertaining and fun read but it does not reach the level of others he has written.
1,What a hack....,"I've read some of the real Alex Cross books on long plane trips and liked them. They weren't Tolstoy, but were a good read. This shallow attempt at a book makes me want to get into writing. The formula seems to be: find a famous author who doesn't want to write anymore, write a lousy book, pay the famous author to puts his name in front and then, voilà: a best seller. I don't know what Micheal Ledwidge's (the real author) percentage is, but James Patterson must be making a killing on this sausage factory approach to literature. The book is not completely unreadable: I did manage to finish it. However, I had to skip over large portions in order to survive to the end. It had it all: two-dimensional characters, stifling political correctness, unbelievable plot twists, sadistic violence for no reason, etc.Stay away from any book that has James Patterson's name along with another author."
4,Step on a Crack,"Fast paced mystery, with realistic characters that show their mental toughness with just the right amount of compassion. The hospital scene made me shed a tear for anyone facing similar situations. Well written and well researched."
2,Flippant Detective,"The first few pages I was going to give this book up. This guy and his wife adopting 10 kids! Even Madonna and Angelina Jolie would be hard put to go that far. Nevertheless, after some flippant back-and-forth, ho-hum, trite conversations amongst the cast, the story finally took a serious turn. The ending turned out to be a complete surprise."
1,Who wrote this thing?,"Janmes Patterson did not write this book. It is absolutely terrible! If you are a Patterson fan don't spend your money on this boring, poorly written book.I think he hired some high school kid to write his first mystery!Mr. Patterson you should be ashamed of yourself!I am sorry I had to give this book any stars!Dreadful!!!!"
1,Spoon up the predictable schlop,"It was a page turner because I couldn't wait to see the next trite, overwrought uninspired literary device he would use. I mean come on, the bad guys are totally bad, the good guys are all saints, the mom dying of cancer it goes on and on. It's a shame this is available on any shelf and lesser known authors who have some craft are ignored."
2,Boring and Irritating!,"This was a very tough book to get through. The first 1/3 of the book was interesting and seemed promising, and then...it just got so awful.There was no plot thickening except at the very beginning and the very end of the book (complete with plot holes!). Throughout the rest of the book, was just a bunch of nonsense to show how bad the bad guys really were and how good the good guys were. At least throw in a couple more plot twists while you're at it.The personal side of the story with the 10 kids and the sick wife was sweet at first, but it was so excessive and sugary it became annoying.The crime is solved mostly by accident. I was hoping SOMEONE (FBI, NYPD, anybody!) would actually use their noggin and make some connections through deductive reasoning, rather than continuing to rely on failed hostage negotiations."
1,Step on a Crack,"This book is a total sham. Patterson is a good writer when the Alex Cross novels bear his name, but this co-writing (read, ""Ghost Writing"") has gotten worse and worse.I gave ""Step On a Crack"" zero stars! It is the final insult to Patterson fans. This new ""co-writer"" sounds like a high school English student, and an average one at that. I found it absolutely unreadable.This is an excellent example of good authors (Patterson is one) caving in to the venal demands of greedy publishers.This is the last book I will buy with the name James Patterson on the cover.Steve Jackson"
2,not a great book,I miss the old James Patterson... he needs to write his own books and not just slap his name on the cover. Good thing I got it at the library.
2,What a disappointment,"Having just read Cross & owning most of James Patterson's books, I felt horribly let down. Lacking in substance, plot and suspense, I found I was skim reading the pages just to get to the end of it.The words felt like a ""stocking filler,"" ie. just written to plump out the book. This is the first book I have read that James Patterson has written with Micheal Ledwidge and I feel he should write books on his own or with one of the previous proven good combinations like Peter De Jonge or Andrew Gross."
2,"Two ""O.K."" books in one does not help","Not one of my favorites by far. Found the family part too distracting from the thriller and slowed the book considerably. The main character, Michael Bennett seems to be able to drop the hostage situation at 5:00 and go home to take care of the 10 kids. Not believable."
2,One head is better than two,"Maybe it is just me but, when James Patterson has two writers on a book (himself included) most of the time it is a fast paced novel with one single story. Honeymoon is probably the best example, tight story solid climax,etc.This book while it is not his worse effort(Thomas Barryman, anyone?)is certainly not his best. There are too many flash backs to Mave's passing. I mean I don't mean to be cruel, but we get it already she was sick with cancer and passed and Michael is hurt. What more do we need to know? My guess is that either Patterson had the idea and got his publishing company to hire a ghost writer who seriously needs to learn how to plan out what he is writing, or he wrote a chapter and the ghost writer wrote one and their thoughts became a lumpy batter rather than a smooth mixture.Good or bad, it is a fast read if you are traveling on an airplane."
5,Thanks Again JP!,"I don't understand all the negative reviews, maybe people are looking for something different out of the books they read or maybe people just feel the need to bash his books because he is a bestselling author. I read JP's books because I enjoy reading & want to be entertained, not because I am searching for the next great american work of literature. I enjoyed the book. I have very little free time so I love short chapters that make you want to keep turning the pages."
5,Another Patterson Novel,"I bought this for my wife and she loved it. I haven't had time to read it yet, but plan to."
3,book review,So far so good. I haven't finished the book yet but I love all of James Patersons book; except the dumb bird children books.
1,I was shocked...,"I couldn't believe that Patterson was so hard up that he took NELSON DEMILLE'S book CATHEDRAL (WHICH WAS A GREAT BOOK WRITTEN IN THE 90'S) and wrote a shallow version of the same story, something that should of been published in a cheapo magazine."
2,Step on a crackhead...,"Well, I would argue that this is not a very good book that James Patterson has written...but that would imply that James Patterson actually wrote it. Patterson has been ""Ghost Writing"" a lot of his novels for years. So let's blame Michael Ledwidge!"
2,Crack the book,When you read a book that could be written without so many pages is a bad book. This book is long-winded and sometimes boring. Maybe the MAIN story is good but you'll need to find it and that will be a strenuous endeavor.
1,Patterson Should Be Ashamed,Patterson should not have stooped so low to put his name on such a poor infantile book. It is a formula book that reads like a comic book. Total trash!
1,Hackneyed bore,"This book has pushed me over the edge. I cannot/will not read another novel with Patterson's name on the cover.It seems it happens sooner or later to all successful novelists. They begin to turn to others to write the tripe and then lend their ""credentials"" to make it seem as though they contributed to the failed effort.If I were Patterson I think I would be a little more selective regarding what bore my name.This novel was boring and a complete waste of time. Each subsequent ""Patterson"" novel is dramatically worse than the previous one.It's time for Patterson to hang it up and stop littering the landscape with his paper products. I would much rather see the tree from which the pages were made.Other's have written a synopsis of the plot (such as it is). Suffice it to say that the REAL author must have flunked Creative Writing I.If you feel this is too severe, I could tell you what I REALLY think !"
1,disappointed again,"Having read all of the Cross novels I was unaware that a good deal of the other James Patterson publications were co-authored. I bought this book mainly as a reflex ""I'm sure I'll like it"" based on seeing the author was James Patterson. Wrong, really wrong. I don't know who actually wrote this one, but it wasn't the James Patterson novel I was expecting. Contrived, thin, paper thin plot, nuisance subplots and disappointing rhetoric led me to give it up after about reading maybe half of it. Just wasn't worth the time or effort, and for sure I will not be sending cash to Amazon for any more of these ghost efforts."
1,Long time Patterson fan...,"I'm a long time Patterson fan but am increasingly disappointed with his books. Step on a Crack is yet another example Patterson barely lifting a finger to write a book. This book also shares a similar storyline to Demille's ""Cathedral"". Not worth the money."
1,Help me!,This was my first patterson book; I assumed I would like it because I like the genre. But this is arguably the worst book I've ever read. Interesting premise to start with but goes absolutely nowhere. The pop culture references in the book lend it an air of complete literary irrelevance.Should I give Patterson another try or is this pretty much it?
4,Review by Nan Kilar and Bob Miller,"Mike Bennett is a veteran NYPD detective with hostage negotiating skills. He also has ten adopted kids and a wife dying of cancer. At the former first lady's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral, twelve men kidnap everyone at the funeral, holding the celebs and dignitaries for ransom. Mike heads the negotiations while trying to spend time with his wife and check on his kids. Do the bad guys get away with it? And who's the really bad guy behind the whole thing?Hopefully, this is the start of a new series for Mr. Patterson. As usual, he's thrown in twists and turns to keep your interest."
3,"I Liked It, But....","I Thought There Was Alot Of Excitement In This Book And I Went Through It With Ease. It Is Kind Of Hard To Believe That A Man, Micheal Bennett, With 10 Kids And A Dying Wife Would Be Working Such A High Powered Situation. But I'll Grant That One To Mr. Pattersons Sensationalism. The Story Of The First Ladys Murder And The Taking Of Hostages At Her Funeral Was Interesting. The High Profile Hostages Rivaled Alot Of Current Stars. Being A Retired NYS Corrections Officer At Sing Sing Correctional I Am Flattered That The Hostage Takers Were NYS Correction Officers. But I Do Have A Few Facts To Add, There Is No Such Thing As A Shift Foreman. Police Special Units Would Not Be Utilized To Quell A Disturbance In A NYS Prison, Anybody Remember Attica? Corrections Has CERT(Corrections Emergency Response Team) For That. The Setup Of A Block(The Most Populated Housing Block In The World) Is Incorrect. However I Did Like The Book And Look Forward To Another With Micheal Bennett."
4,Step on a crack,I found the Book very enjoyable. It was fast moving with thrills and action. I have moved on to the next book in the series.
3,id hate to see what 'poor' condition looks like,"the description of this item was 'in great shape', however, this book has seen better days. other than that, its fine."
5,"Step on a crack, break your back","As usual, unable to stop reading til the end. Patterson is a master at mystery. Always I am surprised at the end. Impatiently waiting for the next Michael Bennett, the one that follows from I, Michael Bennett. Keep them coming Mr. Patts!!!"
4,good read,This book was definitely a good read and I would recommend it to others. It receives a 4 out of 5 in my book!
3,"A Worthy Effort, But Ultimately It Fell Short","I should have known what I was getting into when I picked up this book - shallow characters and a fast-paced plot where the good guys win in the end. Yet, once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down, as is the usual response for James Patterson's books. I must say that the main character's ten perfect kids and dying wife was a little much under the hostage situation for much of the book, not to mention the lame one-liners. All in all this was a worthy effort, but the book will be one that I will soon forget."
3,3.5 out of 5 stars...,"Even though I felt this was a ""typical"" Patterson crime novel I did enjoy some of the plot twists and turns you experience in the last quarter of the book.I felt connected to the main protagonist and his immediate family. The connection between the protagonist and the antagonist was deliberate and I don't know how anyone could root for the bad guys. All in all this was an easy read with a great set of events to build you up to the conclusion. I gotta admit the last twist caught me off guard when I thought I had figured it out to find out my assumption was wrong! Love it."
4,A Stellar Introduction to a Promising Series,"This is the start to what could possibly become one of James Patterson's best series. A beloved former first lady has died and now some of the nation's most elite politicians, celebrities, sports stars, and socialites are gathering in New York for her funeral. Instead of being the intended time of mourning, the funeral is soon turned into a hostage situation, and New York Detective Michael Bennett is called in to try to resolve the situation. Bennett is arguably Patterson's most relatable antagonists to date. By focusing on his character in addition to his fascinating hostage story, Patterson has crafted one of his best novels in recent years."
1,SAVE YER MONEY,"After just finishing Alan Folsom's latest, this book stinks.Did Patterson really partner this book, or was it written bysome high school teenager? To me, this was more like readinga comic book."
4,GOOD Over-the-top,"Other readers say it's over-the-top. And for sure that it is. But it's a GREAT over-the-top. I actually enjoyed fantasizing how this amazing stuff might/could be happening! And I read enough over-the-top that is SO not good, I assure you I can tell the difference. I've read almost all of James Patterson's books and this one is more like a ""chick-flick"" than most of his. I like that about it, too. And wonder if that's Ledwidge's influence? I have no idea because I haven't yet read any of his books. But give this a go. It's fast read even if you read the whole thing. And if you don't like it, you can always not finish reading it, ya know? I liked it!"
5,A refreshing start,"After being extremely disappointed with the last book Cross in the Alex Cross series, I found this new series with lead man Michael Bennett very refreshing. As most of Patterson's books are, this one is also a very quick read (about 6 hours for me). Michael Bennett as the lead character is someone you quickly care about, as well as his family. This is another NYPD detective story but it definitely tugs at the heartstrings as well as it keeps the suspense going nonstop. Overall a very pleasurable read. Hope to see more in this series coming."
3,Check out the Sequel - Run for Your Life,"If you enjoyed the first one, check out the sequelRun for Your Life"
4,Step on a Crack,"I like the new character with his 10 kids. The kids are a ""little"" too perfect but it's entertaining. Once again, like in Beach Road, Patterson's culprit comes out of blue. It borders on implausible. However weak the ending may be, I remain a fan and will continue to read his books."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Though some of the characters lack depth, the pace of a Patterson novel just keeps me reading. It doesn't take long to read one and it rarely gets boring. I'm rarely disappointed with Patterson because he provides a good escape for an afternoon."
3,Not that great.,"This book was written ""with"" Michael Ledgwidge, which, has always implied that he was the ""real"" author who did most (if not all) of the writing. That said, the book is fairly well written. Unfortunately, the story line is so improbable that I had trouble finishing the book -- it almost made me laugh out loud. Would I recommend it? For the beach or if you don't mind over-the-top plots."
3,Big score and small family moments deliver okay time-passer,"Mid-level quality James Patterson collaboration, not great but not bad. You get a big, broad caper plot which is somewhat cartoony but just credible enough to keep your interest, and a subplot involving protagonist cop Michael Bennett's sad family situation that I found moving but some may feel goes over the top in tugging the heartstrings. There's nothing subtle or unique about ""Step on a Crack"", but it's certainly a painless and adequately engaging reading experience."
5,Outstanding Read - Great New Main Character,"I never thought I would enjoy a character as much as Alex Cross, but Michael Bennett was great. Imagine being a police detective with 10 adopted kids. The twists in this book were great. I can't wait for the next book! Great job, Mr Patterson. S.L. Chessor author of Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers and My Tongue Fell Out.Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers: A Poetry Collection"
1,Not One of Patterson's Best,I've read several of James Patterson's books and this one has to be the worst one that I have tried to read. I made three attempts to give this book a chance hoping that it would get better & it never did. Patterson's Alex Cross books are much more excited to read...I highly recommend one of those.
3,One of my favorite authors,"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors and this book was the same as the others i have read; happy, sad, i cried (have to remind myself it's a book), i get mad and more emotions"
1,James Patterson? I don't think so.,"There are several authors that write so well and are so gifted that I will buy their books without even cracking the cover. James Patterson was one of them. I bought ""Step on a Crack"" like that. I got home and settled in for another good read. After I got into the first chapter I started thinking, ""Did I buy the wrong book? This isn't the James Patterson I'm familiar with."" I closed the book and looked at the cover only to find another name on it.My fault no doubt, but I feel like I got ripped off. He's obviously not writing these co-authored books. I have eight of his Alex Cross novels sitting in my bookcase, so I'm very familiar with his writing. He may be reading the manuscripts with red pen in hand and making notes in the margins...maybe. How about the real author's name on top and at the bottom: Edited by James Patterson?Anyway, I can't help you with a review of this book because I never finished it, nor have I even picked up another one of his (?) books."
2,Not what it was cracked up to be,"This was an unfortunately shallow book with inadequate character and plot development, feeling more like a storyboard than a novel. The newly introduced Mike Bennett is a seasoned officer with a human face who could go places in the future if only the writing would take him there. Better to write fewer solid books with some depth than a spate of predictable, disappointing ones."
3,"Same old, same old","More of the same from the Patterson Factory. (You didn't think Henry Ford personally assembled all his cars, did you?) New hero is Alex Cross in whiteface. It will pass a pleasant two hours of reading, but totally forgettable."
2,Shallow and Humdrum,"To say I was disappointed is an understatement. I use to eagerly await the latest James Patterson book. Sadly, Patterson has taken the route so many writers take when they become successful - they write to meet the demands of a publisher who has signed them to mega-dollar contracts. Step on a Crack was boring and hum-drum. Where normally I do not want to put a Patterson book down and read every word to see how he develops the chararcters, I found myself skipping pages and whole sections of the book - because I knew I wasn't missing anything. While I thought the ending was clever, it was not really shocking. In hindsight, I should have done what Billy Crystal did in the movie When Harry Met Sally - read the last chapter to see how the book ended. I wouldn't have missed anything."
2,Overly Sentimental Short Story,"I've read ALL the Patterson books. I found this one a real disappointment. It was an overly sentimental short story disquised as a novel with large type and copious amounts of white space. Of course, it looks marvelous after being packaged and advertised by Patterson's considerable marketing machine. He takes on co-authors like changing clothes in order to put out three or four books a year. Unfortunately, I think he's lost his edge and is in it now for the money."
1,Not good,"This book was not good and i am very dissapointed. I am an avid reader of james pattersons and have enjoyed the entire alex cross series in addition to the others ( I havent read the womens murder club ) but this book was unrealistic , the dialogue was bad and to be honest i found myself thinking - this was not written by james patterson. James - start writing your own stuff again and stick with alex cross - a detective with 10 adopted kids is ridiculous."
2,Very Disappointing,"While I am a huge James Patterson fan, his latest book fell short in several ways. First of all,the improbability of it all went beyond the norm, i.e. why were the children still having a Christmas pageant blocks away from the siege of the century? The characterization was weak, and the seeming most influential protagonist went missing for nearly two-thirds of the book. Usually I can't put his books down, but this one took me a little longer."
4,Good Easy Read,If you like suspense thrillers and easy reading this is a great book. It doesn't have too many twists and turns and is easy to follow. The characters are very likable.
4,Exciting thriller,"I really liked the story line of this story. The former first lady has been murdered, but made to look like an accident. In steps Michael Bennett. He has to talk to the hijackers to help free the famous hostages. Patterson weaves in a twist to make it an enjoyable thriller.The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't like how short the chapters were. Bennett is also made out to be some super cop. I would not think anyone could handle his wife dying in the hospital and the stress of this job without having a complete melt down."
4,James Patterson-Michael Bennett,"Michael Bennett, the epitome of a NYC Irish Policeman. If only he would marry Mary Catherine and give his 10 kids a Mom instead of a Nanny. I hope Seamus lives a long happy life."
4,One of the best books of its kind on the subject,The expanded version of QDA has got to be one of the best foundational books on the subject of qualitative analysis. It has just the right depth and breath to lead the reader to the appropriate methodology for their research purposes and enough information to lead the reader to more in depth readings on procedures and analysis.
2,MORE MEAT NEEDED,"I'VE TRIED EVERY TAMALE SELECTION ON AMAZON, THIS WAS THE NEXT TO WORSE.TOO MUCH MASA ' I HAD TO SEARCH FOR THE MEAT.BEST BUY AND WORTH EVERY PENNYELK TAMALESOVER STUFFED W/ MEAT. LOW FAT & BEST TASTING.AND THE WINNER IN WORST TASTE & FRESHNESS?Schwan's Beef Tamales"
4,Cute Puppies,"This story was so touching, and cute! I felt like I was right there with Kaya, visiting the brave Lone Dog and her puppies. I think Kaya's relationship with Lone Dog is very entertaining, and I can easily imagine the puppies in my mind's eye. The ending may not be what readers' desire, but at least it didn't end the way I originally thought it did.Besides the dogs, this book contained the usual history pages, and pages describing what Kaya and her family/friends do around their Native American camp.Dog-lovers who read the Kaya books will enjoy this book the way I did, and I personally think any Kaya reader will think of this as a great book about love and friendship (I apologize for how sappy I sound)."
2,Kaya American Girl,To my surprize on the inside cover had a name that had been erased. I should have been told. And the cover was a different blue then the ones sold in the set.Came on time and in good condition all but the name on the cover.VCorbean
3,Loved it,I loved it. It was a good weekend project and mounted into a frame beautifully. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good beginner's project or just a quick project to fill in sometime to keep from being bored.
3,I was a bit disappointed,"I was looking for a book to give to my 25 year old that doesn't know the difference between a butter knife and a fork. I was hoping this would help him cook some basic dishes, Although it had some of those things it didn't have many. Not bad but Not fantastic."
4,XMas gift,Book is an XMas gift and is exactly what this young lady needs as she starts cooking on her own--good tips and recipes. Sure she will enjoy it and so do I as I read thru before wrapping.
5,Buy This; Cook from This!,"This is a fabulous cookbook. I bought my first two at a library book fair and gave one away to the daughter of a friend. Since then I have bought more and recommended it a number of times.My four boys don't like the way the author talks to teens, but ignore that, and what you have is a tremendous collection of from-scratch recipes that are very do-able. My favorite is the stuffed bell peppers. I had never before seen a recipe that called for simmering the stuffed peppers in a pot of tomato juice. They come out beautifully tender, and then the remaining liquid makes a terrific soup, with or without additions.So, buy this book and you'll be glad you did."
5,True bestseller,I bought the first copy of this book during my son's elementary school book sale. My son is going to college this fall and I am buying a copy to send with him to school and a few for his friends. It is the most used cookbook in the house. I cannot even count how many I bought over the years.
1,Not one color picture.,"This is the least exciting book for a new cook....no pictures, color excitment!!!!No imagination. Doesn't excite me to cook anything and I have been cooking for over 60 years!"
5,For Beginners of All Ages,"Even though the book is written for teens, it has been great for me. I'm in my thirties and I hate cooking. I made three of the recipies out of this book already and my husband ate them! I'm so excited because now my husband can wash the pots & pans. Seriously, this book is great because the author takes you through the recipes with easy instructions for extreme beginners like me. In no other cookbook have I found recipes for simple things like meatballs. In the back there is also a section with menu for entertaining. Hooray for Evelyn Raab!"
5,Funny Cookbook,"I like the way the author writes, kind of like a friend is telling you the recipes and she explains everything so well for all of us clueless people, lol"
5,Simple yet delicious receipes,This is a perfect book for anyone just starting out on their own. I bought it when I moved into my first apartment and it provided wonderful and tasty receipes that don't take a lot of time or skill to make. The author also provides some witty remarks with each recipe and makes the book fun to read as well as easy to follow. Recipes range from how to make a chocolate torte or roast a turkey to instructions on how to boil water. This book is full of useful meal ideas put forward in a light-hearted manner. A must-have for any newcomer to the kitchen.
3,"Effectively covers the propane tanks, but...","doesn't hold up very well to the elements. I've had this cover on my trailer for about a year now, and it is very close to needing replacement (even though I put an additional tarp over the top of this while in storage)."
1,Even Sherbets need sugar.,"From Your Ice Cream Maker by Coleen & Bob Simmons. > >The first recipe I used from this book was Raspberry Sherbert on page 70. >It not only says it makes 3 cups when, in fact it makes much more but it >omits any sugar. My husband made a double batch of this for guests at our >home, ruined 4 packages of frozen raspberries and it was not edible. My >first clue was when a four year old spit out his first bite. I am afraid to >try any more recipes in this book because it was obviously not proof-read. >I will not take any more chances. I will also tell my friends not to >purchase this book."
5,Thick-it,"Works wonderfully, I have an elderly roommate and it helps her greatly with her favorite liquids and makes them much easier to swallow."
5,cheaper than the pharmacy,"bought this for work. works better than the pharmacy brand, we use less than we have to use of the cheap stuff."
1,not such a fantasy,"Be aware that this is a re-print, it's only 200 pages long, and there is little-no substance to plot. It doesn't even have real heat in the sex scenes, at least not enough to keep me interested.If you want to read a story about a perfect and rich senator's daughter falling in love with a reporter (who is also perfect in body) on a tropical island... perhaps this is for you. For me though, it was too perfect, the 'danger' went away without any real conflict or satisfying resolution, and all of the supporting characters (who seemed potentially interesting) didn't get time or opportunity to enrich the story.For me, the cover is the best part of this book."
2,disappointed,i usually love Carly's books. I didn't realize this was an old one until i had it home. this was truely awful. predictable fluff. i ended up skimming most of it. sorry. will look forward to her next new one
3,This is a light romantic read,"Secret Fantasy by Carly Phillips is one of those stories that you read that is quick and easy and is a light romantic read. Fleeing from a scandal, Juliette Stanton is a run-away bride who goes to a fantasy island where she hopes to live out a secret fantasy of being the center of a guy's universe. She meets Doug Houston, and from day one she is smitten. But Doug is actually an undercover reporter trying to get a scoop on a story. He is everything that Juliette has ever wanted from a man, but she doesn't know that he is hiding secrets such as who he really is and what he wants from her."
2,Sappy but light fun,"Very sappy but fun. I like the premise of the book, but I think there could have been more to the story. It was an ok book to read over the weekend, but not something I would come back for more. I expected more of Carly Phillips since I've enjoyed so many of her other books."
2,Not much to it,"Secret Fantasy by Carly Phillips is a typical light romance read. For me what made it a bit unique was the way that Juliette and Doug, who previously seemly ruined her life by outing her now ex-fiancee's mob links, meet. Juliette's sister sends her to the island where dreams are supposed to come true. This was about the only really interesting part of this book.This book was super short and had very little plot. If you are looking for a simple sexy read this might be a good choice but we aware that this is reprint and is only 200 pages long."
5,"Re-release from 2001....Simple, Sweet, light romance","This is re-release from 2001 -short afternoon read. The concept is that Juliette is the daughter of Senator and because of mob connection she cancels her wedding. A Chicago report gets wind of her Secret Fantasy vacation to excape the scandal and signs himself up for same vacation spot. Simple, Sweet, light romance.If you enjoy this genre I would suggest;Tangled Up In Love,Talk Me DownandThe Bachelor (The Chandler Brothers, Book 1)."
2,Boring,Carly is one of my favorite authors but she blew it with this one just boring don't waste your time or money on this one.
1,"Old book, new publication date","I am highly annoyed at how Kindle book publication dates listed on Amazon are not the original publication date of the book. Secret Fantasy has a copyright date of 2001, and the book reads like an old style romance. I enjoy reading this author, but I would not have purchased this book if I'd known it was a re-issue."
5,For Starters...we finally get Closed Captioned!,"Well, it's about time. The previous four seasons of Homicide: Life On The Street did not come with subtitles of any kind. Now, they are here. For me, it's important to hear every wonderful stitch of crackling dialogue.Usually, I watch the subtitles on DVDs & Video anyway. Sometimes it helps to see what a charactor is saying. Especially with foreign accents.Go ahead and try understanding a lot of Waking Ned Devine without subtitles? Incidently, there's a wonderful Scottish film called ""My Name is Joe' directed by Ken Loach which is so heavily accented that it automatically comes with subtitles.And, now with the pending DVD Fall release of ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" Season Five, it will be that much sweeter to have the option to finally follow the bated words of Pembleton, Bayliss, Howard, et al that much closer.THANK YOU A&E;!"
3,Only slightly better then VHS,I am the biggest fan of Homicide. I taped every episode that aired. I can't tell you how thrilled I was to know that one of tv's greatest shows would be coming to DVD.That is until I bought the first sets that came out.The picture is pretty grainy in spots and seemed like a rush job getting it to DVD. I looks like a copy of someones copy not even a perfect print.The audio is no better then any DVD put in your surround sound without 5.1. And the extras lack.How about some deleated scenes some cast commentary? I mean give something back to the fans who followed it through the years.Even if you could take the time and at least make it WIDESCREEN I couldnt thank you enough NBC and A&E.; But for the asking price of the DVD sets at least make it worth it to the fans and not just a easy review VHS copy.Brian
3,Season Five Slides...,"Homicide: Life On The Street - Season Five - takes an unbelievable dive in quality, writing and originality from the first four seasons. Seriously, it's sort of shocking to watch the slow slip. However, even this bad season of ""Homicide"" is better than virtually every other show on TV at the time. Rumor has it that seasons six and seven are even worse - so I'll quit before the last seasons overtake the brilliant first four."
1,The power of deception,Don't give these frauds another penny of your money. There is better speculative fiction out there. Wake up? Castenada was no sorcerer. Mickey Mouse was a sorcerer in Fantasia. Castaneda was a sorcerer in his own Fantasies. The guy is a liar. Pure and simple. What more does anyone have to say. Except that a fool and wisdom never get together in the first place.
4,A book for deep thinkers.,"Carlos Castaneda has once again provided a vivid, detailed description of a new way of thinking. This book is a good read but plan on taking some time with it if you plan to maximize the experience. Thought provoking presentation."
5,Truth and the Beholder,"Truth as well as beauty reside in the brain of the beholder. One is heard and one is seen as perfect to the senses.My interpretation of the words in this book feel truthful as do those of the Bible, Koran and Bagavad Gita. Myths are made of these."
5,A veritable 'Bible' for Self-Knowledge,"I didn't especially care for Castaneda himself, when I met him, and I realize that he may have completely fabricated don Juan and his teachings, but I have recently finished reading ""The Power of Silence"" for my TENTH time in 35 years, and still find it awesomely powerful and on-point! In fact, each time I read this book, I keep finding ideas and methods that I either hadn't noticed before or had forgotten about. I consider this book a must-read for any serious transformational seeker who wishes to attain self-mastery and illumination."
5,Lab manual,Very up to date information on new diagnostic tests and procedures. A great reference for health care students and seasoned professionals.
1,Waste of time & money,This book was mandatory for my nursing program. This book is awful. Such a waste of time & effort to find simple things (and who has that to waste when you are in school?) None of my classmates have anything good to say about it either.
5,Lifesaver,"When my mother was going through menopause a number of years ago, my grandmother recommended this herbal compound. I had to search high and low for it at the time (before internet searching brought the world to your doorstep!), but when I found it, my mother felt like a new person. Since then I've talked with many women who have used the Lydia Pinkham products and have been very pleased with the effects. The combination of natural herbs tastes terrible, but work wonders at relieving a multitude of symptoms associated with menstruation and menopause."
3,Not Sure Yet,"I followed directions as indicated on the bottle and it appeared that my hot flashes ceased somewhat, but not completely. I will continue trying it for being that I am 54 and have had my hot flashes for some time now, perhaps it's going to take a while before I can actually see a major difference."
5,Live saver during TOM...,This really does help with the cramps and bloating during my menstrual period. I also take it throughout the month when I need the exptra iron.
3,Juju,"I don't know if this helps hot flashes because I couldn't drink it. I have a full bottle in the cabinet but it just tasted so awful, I could not drink it. I can tolerate allot of bad tastes if I know they will help, but just couldn't do this 3 times a day. I hear it is an awesome product though, if you can tolerate the taste."
2,GROSS,"I bought this for ttc for a girl. I am willing to try most things to get some pink in our house, but this stuff was BEYOND gross! I couldn't even come close to having even one more sip after the initial drink. SO GROSS!"
5,Delightful little bon-bons from Elgar,"I first bought ""The Lighter Elgar"" from the MHS in cassette form about 25 years ago. It was only about 45 minutes long, but each track was a gem. I have finally found this album in CD format with about twice as many tracks on it. It contains all of the original tape and then again as many other tracks. If you like light British music that doesn't sound like marching band music, you will probably like it. Tracks 9 to the end are the original tape tracks. You won't find some of this music anywhere else, or at least anywhere I've looked, and I've looked for 25 years."
5,don't leave home without reading it,"This is a very good book! It explains the development of a person's personality since infancy. The pathologies that could result from a very dysfunctional upbringing is likewise presented in clear and simple terms that makes it easy to understand. I strongly recommend this book, not only for the students of psychiatry but for anyone who wants to understand what makes up his/her personality!"
2,Passport to Web Radio,"This was once a helpful introduction to web radio with stations' web addresses. It reminded me of the 1940's and 50's, exploring the AM band late into the night when you could hear Nashville, New York, Denver, Des Moines, Dallas, New Orleans, Del Rio, Havana, the world brought on the moon ether. Now it is so outdated as to be of little help. Real Player has changed vastly in two years, and most stations' web addresses are obsolete. What is needed is a yearly revision, or better still, continuous updating on line.TJCantwell cantwell@naxs.com"
5,My Daughter loves it,"I got this and some origami paper for my daughter for Christmas, she loves it. Though she knew many of the patterns already, there were some that she hadn't managed to teach herself. She started using it right away."
5,Origami for children,I gave this to my grandaughter who has ready access to paper and loves projects of all kinds. This is fun for her alone or with friends.
4,Nice stocking stuffer,"This little bookk, at a great price, makes a nice intro to origami. It is very basic. I found that most of the paterns in this book are repeated in Montroll's ""Teach Yourself Origami,"" so I passed this on on to a cousin who was intrigued when she saw what I'd been doing. It's fine as far as it goes, but it isn't intended to go vary far. You can't beat the price. I thought it was a misprint."
4,Easy Origami,"This book is very kool! If you want to do something to pass the time, buy this book. It is reasonably priced and after you do a few foldings, you can really use anything to fold with, not just the origami paper. It is fun and relaxing. I like the ease of the book. Because it is so simplified, you are able to remember the folds, and, there with you for a lifetime."
2,too easy,"I realize the title is ""Easy Origami"", but this is a bit too easy. I expected a few simple patterns to illustrate each of the folds, but most of these don't even look remotely like the object they are meant to portray without some *serious* imagination. You can get enough patterns like this online to make this book useless."
1,wway to easy,i am a soso kind of origmi folder i thought i would be able to make many beautififul origami but it requires a lot of inmagination
2,"S A D L Y,......I T......W A S N ' T......E A S Y.....F O R ......M E","I bought this book, EASY ORIGAMI, together with some origami paper, with visions of learning oragami from the bottom up. When I finally learned how to do it super-well, I reasoned, I could design my OWN oragami figures, of ballet dancers..... and of formal gardens.........and of great English manorhouses.............and tiaras, computers, computer printers..etc! The world would beat a path to my door to see my beautiful creations, and I'd be famous!Sadly, however, none of this ever happened....because the instructions in this book are hard to follow. I could do nothing except a few folds. If this book, indeed, IS ""Easy Origami"", I suppose what I, (and many other origami beginners), need is: EasIER ORIGAMI"".....or better, ""EasIEST ORIGAMI"". : ("
5,Origami,This is a great book for any beginner Origami enthusiast. It is easy to follow with lots of great diagrams and instructions on cool origami projects.
5,Grandson Loved It!!!!,Purchased this book for my grandson (age 6) who is currently into Origami. He totally loved it and could not wait to try all of the projects outlined in the book. Very clear instructions and diagrams for each project make it easy for a 1st grader to follow.
4,Origami book,"Overall the Origami book was good for the price. However, one might be able to find the same book at a local art store for around the same price, which would avoid the 3 weeks it took for this book to arrive."
4,This is a great beginners book,"I sent this book to an inmate in the county jail. He got a lot of enjoyment out of it. It is for beginners, and has a lot of the basics covered."
4,Good challenging start at Oragami ... Well worth it,"I purchased this for my 7 year old. The book has some easy start Origami (swan, fish, etc.) and then moves toward others that are more challenging (water bomb, frog, etc.). She really enjoys it. I can see more Origami in her future :) (NOTE: it does not include paper, so I purchasedOrigami Paper Traditional Prints 8 1/4"" 49 Sheets)."
1,How Disappointing!,"I received this book for Christmas from my sister, who shares my enjoyment of cooking. As I eagerly began reading it, I realized that it consisted of a series of anecdotes, all related to women being oppressed by men, by society, by whatever. But the common theme was that women were oppressed, and then...women were oppressed, and then again...women were oppressed, and oh, by the way, did the author mention that women were oppressed? Sigh. This is a story that deserves telling, not one that deserves to be hijacked by a woman with a cause."
1,Offensive to southern women,"Laura Schenone's book is more a tribute to rewriting history through the eyes of political correctness than a scholarly work. I found her comments in chapter 3 about southern white women so offensive I stopped reading the book. I felt her comments showed little research into the lives of most southern white women, and no attempt at all to try and understand how the agricultural economy and lifestyle shaped southern cooking. Her vision and understanding on the mid-1800 south seems to have come from a novel, ""Uncle Tom's Cabin.""I bought this book because I thought, based on reviews, this was a scholarly, historical, book. I find it a book colored by the authors prejudices than a book of facts and thoughtful, objective, analysis."
2,A Disappointment to Virginians,"I enjoyed the book for its generality. However, in all her research, you'd think that the author would've learned that Jamestown's year of note was 1607 - not 1606. And the first Thanksgiving was not held at Plymouth but at Berkeley Plantation. With those two facts askew, I'm having a hard time believing the rest of the research."
3,"Not definitive, but definitely fun","This is a pretty good book. It's not a scholarly masterwork, by any means, but it's an enjoyable overview of American history told through recipes, etc. I don't think that the theme of the book is women being oppressed. It's more about women making the best of the opportunities they had. I agree that Schenone errs on the side of too P.C.- and the ""All Woman"" chapter is pretty nauseating. But I gave this book to my sister, who is a way more hardcore Southern White Woman than I will ever be (for example, she thinks that she should be allowed to list her ethnicity on the US Census as ""Confederate"") and SHE was not offended by the SWW stuff. In all it's a good time and makes a great gift by people who dig this sort of thing."
5,COOL,This is perfect for my new gamecube i bought from you guys my gosh i think this will keep my busy on road trips for a while
2,The idea was great...,"but my computer just didn't like it. Being a fan of The Sims, to control ghosts and scare people sounded great. Excited, I loaded it and it just went down-hill from there. The sound was fine, it was the video that was terrible. Instead of movies for the intro, I got random pictures of the video. When playing, the animation was choppy. Playing it was worse, the controls were delayed and frustrating. I didn't get it from Amazon.com, and I wish I did since I had one hard time trying to return it. Eventually, one of the techs loaded it on their computer and was experiancing the same thing. Again, the idea of the game was great, I just wish they would have spent more time on it before releasing it."
4,Great!,"Ghost Master is one of my favorite games. It gets hard as the levels get more towards the end of the game though, but it's still very fun. My favorite haunt is when you bind that feather chicken thing to a kid and make them do 'seep blood'."
4,Cute shoes,"I bought these for my daughter to wear in a wedding. They fit perfectly and look adorable. There were no ""ouchy"" rubs from the straps! The only drawback is that they get dirty easy and are hard to clean."
1,Here's a good piece of financial advice:,"If you really want to get on the fast track, DON'T PAY $219.99 FOR A BOARD GAME !!"
3,A bit disappointed.,"I had hoped it was more fun, and educational. There is little skill needed beyond the basics of save, cut monthly spending, and buy properties (or stocks), and the winner is the one who has better luck with the dice. I wanted a game that used strategy, so that it'd be more fun for me and my friends. I must say it does teach one important thing, and that is to balance your financial spreadsheet, and WHY it is so important to do this in real life. If you don't know where you are financially right now, you can't know where you're going. I know, you might be saying, ""Yeh, whatever."", but its true. This game would have been totally worth it just for that, if it didn't have a crazy price tag.Also, the premise of buying houses with a positive cashflow upon purchase is unrealistic in todays world, which is 90% of what you do in this game. The game needs to employ more strategy, and that will make it fun."
4,$$ Well Spent for Changing your Mindset,"I would highly recommend the game for those who are serious about changing their mindset about obtaining wealth. Its easy to stay in your comfort zone and do nothing. The game uses realestate and stockmarket investments as examples of vehicles for obtaining wealth.If $200 is too much to invest in something that will change your thinking forever, then you're not ready. If you want to change your mindset about money and obtaining wealth then buy the game and play it often - otherwise stay in the rat race and be miserable for the rest of your life.What I really liked about the game is that it exposed the way that I thought about money. It caused me to realize that I was in a place of comfort and needed to change to get out of the rat race. Mr Kiyosaki is teaching simple principles and exposing the way ""most"" people think about money.If you intend to become wealthy then apply the principles you will learn in this game and you will get the desired result."
3,"Too expensive, not realistic, general principles taught are OK at best","I've had the game a couple years, and the price has went down about $70 since then. Even at the current $130 it's a little steep for what you're getting. Someone has been making a haul on this one... what can I say :)That said, read Throckmorton Scribblemonger's review, along with Tim Ostroms review, both make excellent observations about this game. If you are looking for realistic, that this game is not. If you are looking for some abstract principles to consider, you MAY find something here."
2,"The game is the same ""doodad"" it warns you about","I find it absolutely outrageous that Kiyosaki thinks his game is worth $200. If you want to learn how to make money, read a book and be prudent in your actions (like not blowing $200 bucks on a game)! The educational value of this game is equal to a good financial magazine article."
3,Game Is Not Worth The Price or Time,"This game is only educational to an extent. Most of what happens is based on luck and random occurrances and not strategy. In the real world, you count on your knowledge and strategy to get ahead. If you want luck, go buy a lotto ticket.I had more fun playing the game Acquire than I did this game and it only costs $35.$200 is way too expensive for this game. I might pay 50 bucks for it."
3,Fun and education but too expensive,"I played this game with friends and had a great time. It is a lot of fun and it helps you to think differently about money and investing. No, it doesn't fully translate into the ""real world"", but what does? I would say that it would still be a great game to own and help to teach your kids. However - I couldn't believe how expensive it is. I can't believe anyone would really pay $200 for a GAME. Yes, it teaches you, but it's still just a game. I would like to have a copy of this game. I really enjoyed it, but I will never pay $200 for a game. I think I'll learn alot more about financial wisdow from keeping my $200 and investing it, rather than spending it on a game."
5,Love This,"I bought a total of three (not realizing that one is the longer, crook-necked one. That's fine and I might even have bought all three that way.) All are serving me well."
4,A Wonderful Rhythmic Dance,"I kept having to remind myself that this was a percussion-only performance. The listener is never disappointed as Ethos weaves a pulsing fabric upon which free rhythmic exploration can, and does, occur. Always inviting and accessible, we are given such a rich layered dialogue upon which to respond. I rated this performance 4 out of 5 only in hopes that Ethos will continue to perfect the happiness they create. A very strong entre for a group of talented percussionists. I can easily imagine a wonderful film score or vocal collaboration from this ensemble in the near future. Congratulations!"
3,Mass Produced - Fair Quality,It obviously mass produced. It has marginal fit and finish. The joining edges of the metal face are poorly aligned and the bindings are crude. It will work for my application. But I figured I would get a better quality case for the price.
1,More junk from China,"This is the second rack I bought from Gator and both had defects, seems they can't use a rivet gun. Both had bad rivets in the latches, sent the first one back took forever this one I fixed myself.. never again.."
2,Not very durable,"I got this case because it was the only one I have seen for the Sync that is clear. However it is not very durable: the phone never felt secure in the beltclip due to the latch being so high up on the phone (instead of in the middle), and the manufacturing on the clip itself is very spotty. I had it for less than a week before some of 'spokes' on the belt clip broke off. Very disappointing. I went to using the protective front of this case with the backing of another."
3,Watch out for the S&H!!!,"The prices are great... until you see the shipping and handling charges. I don't have the invoice handy, but suffice to say the S&H; is far more than the price listed for the actual item. And they don't tell you the cost until after you've already ordered the merchandise.On the plus side, the cover is easy to install. It just snaps on, allows the color of the phone to show. It works great, too. I dropped my phone, not a scratch. I didn't bother using the clip, though."
2,samsung a707 case,"I liked the protection it gave my phone, but the little side tabs cracked off. I also liked the clip to attach it to my clothing."
3,GOOD BUY - LOOK FOR SHIPPING CHARGES,"I purchased two of this product. Each fits like a glove on a hand, and performs as it should. It is also easy to remove and put it back together.However, I paid way too much for shipping. (more $5.00 for each item or about $13.00 for shipping). What bothered me was that both the items were sent via regular mail and they both came in a small single package. Each item weighs about an ounce each.I think if the product was to be shipped in one packge I should not be charged twice. Also since it was not overnighted or sent via priotiry mail, the shipping charges were way too much."
5,"Authentic? Forgery? Who cares, it's fascinating!","This book is really a great read, and a fascinating account of Shostakovich and the world of Russian classical music during the time of Stalin. Are these really his own words? Maybe, maybe not, but whomever said them is extremely insightful and a great thinker and writer.Anyone who is a fan of 20th century classical music really should read this book!"
5,Certainly one of the best books I have ever read.,"This scathing endictment of the soviet union we never saw takes its place not only as a book of great interest, but great importance. Very well written, intellectually stimulating, and a valuable window into the life of one of the great artists of the twentieth century, this book takes its place on my shelf as my personal favourite."
1,Stop buying this book,"Regardless of this book being a ""good read,"" I think its existence is harmful to the name of Shostakovich. Much research has been done by Laurel Fay in regards to this--check out The Shostakovich Casebook for more information regarding this, as well as a good read about Soviet culture and Shostakovich's life. But this book is not for those interested in Shostakovich, and the fact that it is so popular is disturbing since so much of it is so false."
1,Empire of darkness? - as you like it -,"I agree that Testimony involves interesting and entertaining material, but a good story can not be an excuse for fraud. Testimony, is a 'planned' attack on Soviet Union and communism, because the western world found Shostakovich too good to be in the 'empire of darkness'.One has stated that his wife opposes to Testimony while his children do not. Please do think about companies his children work with... All effort is to put Shostakovich to the 'correct' side. But I'm afraid he's not. I has just listened Symphony 1917, ""Dawn of Humanity""."
1,Not worth buying.,I purchased this card for a Garmin Streetpilot Colormap GPS. I am using Garmin Mapsource software.I updated the GPS software to support the 128 mb card.I am planning a long trip next month.I downloaded about 100 detail maps to the card which is about 97 mb of data. Some of these maps are missing when viewed on the GPS. Garmin finally told me after about 8 e-mails that the Colormap can only use 50 maps maximum on this card. That would equal about 50 mb of data. A 64mb card is all that can be used.I spent $60 on a card that that is useless.
5,Works like a charm!,"We recently took a driving trip from Chicago to Key West making numerous stops in between, including metro Atlanta. I was able to load a significant number of maps onto the memory cartridge, covering almost all of the locations we traveled between Illinois and Florida. We were able to accurately navigate all of the major cities we visited which included Orlando, Daytona, Miami, Naples and Tampa, and never felt lost. More importantly, I never had to reload additional maps after the intital download which did take some time. However, whatever time it took to put the maps onto the cartridge in the first place was certainly made up for by the convenience of having them ALL there when we needed them!"
4,Recoil Pad from Amazon for my vintage shotgun.,"In the final analysis this worked out fine. I have a 1955 vintage Remington 870 with its original wood stock and I expected this pad to fit. It did not fit! Hogue provided superb service when I telephoned and they exchanged it for a pad which had to be ground down. I followed their instructions and selected an appropriate pad. BUT, nowhere in their instructions do they make it clear that the pad has two invisible slits pre-made for the screws that mount to the stock. I was lucky and found the slits and the holes did line up with the existing screw holes in the stock, but it took a video available on YouTube courtesy of Brownell to bring the whole operation together. Check this out: [...] and also this help from MidwayUSA [...]"
1,Does not fit a 1100,This kick pad is far too small for my 1100. It is a nice kick pad just doesnt fit what it says it does
4,Gorillaz- Fighting for a Funkier Tomorrow,"Gorillaz- fighting For A Funkier TomorrowThe Gorillaz, Damon Albarn (lead singer for Blur) Dan the Automator (San Francisco hip-hop visionary) and Del the Funkee Homosapien (Cousin of gangster rapper Ice Cube) have created a yet another piece of music that points to where hip-hop should be heading in the next millenium. Fans of the futuristic Hip -Hop concept album Deltron 3030 will find Tomorrow Comes Today a compainion piece to the LP. Mabye not so much a companion but a distant cousion, for Tomorrow comes Today if farther removed from anything weve heard."
3,The Sounds of Tomorrow,"Gorillaz first single, ""Tomorrow Comes Today"", is a melancholic piece of urban pop, where Damon Albarn`s mellow voice makes an excelent combination with the hip/ trip-hop elements and textures. It`s also one of the best moments of the band`s debut album, and one of the most infectious singles of the last years. The CD also includes an english version of the cuban-sounding ""Latin Simone"" and the hip-hop oriented ""Rock the House"". As an extra, there`s also the quiet and lo-fi ""12D3"", probably the less interesting of the bunch but still worth a listen.A good beginning for an innovative and witty project."
4,over-hyped but good,"pick it up. its a good single, if you like albarn then you will love this. what have you got to lose, other then a few bucks? who cares anyway. check out the site its fun, especially the mixer thing."
3,Only for hardcore gorillaz fans,"This CD is pretty good, it features everything that is on the region 2 DVD of the same name, I'm not a big fan of tomorrow comes today, i think it's one of the weaker tracks on their CD, but the jump the gut video is pretty funny and the track music for it is pretty good, other than that, a lot of waste on this CD. The tomorrow dub is not good and the video is the same and the song is the same, overall a copy of the original with some bonus things, as stated before only for hardcore fans."
4,Good little watch to learn to tell time,"These arrived nicely. I ordered two and noticed immediately that the tag price was 19.99. I felt I had gotten a discount and no S&H. These are for ages 5&7 mostly to learn to tell time the old fashioned way. I know my grandson will love the camo style. If it quits, I also know that Timex will take care of it. I like the adjustability of the band and it seems to be secure."
2,Not impressed...,I bought this watch for my 3.5 year old. It only lasted 2 months before breaking. The dial on the side (that you use to set time) broke completely off and then moisture got behind the watch face making it all cloudy. Cheaply made. I am returning it to Timex for a refund.
2,didn't work,"We got this watch for our 7 year grandson, My son just called and told us that they have been unable to get the watch to work. We are very disapointed as this was his Christmas gift."
2,Disappointed!,"Already quit working on day 2. First watch for my 8 year old grandson and was losing about 2 minutes per hour. After resetting several times, the stem came out of the watch! Not happy at all with this product . Bought watch based on brand name and am extremely let down!!!!"
4,Good gift,Good little boys watch. Gave as a gift and he liked it. Good for 6 to 11 years old. Thanks.
4,My Grandson Loves His Watch,"My 7-year-old grandson really feels like a big-shot with this watch. His dad wanted him to be comfortable with a traditional timepiece instead of digital. Turns out that the traditional hands of the clock are a big hit with my grandson too. And a couple of his little friends have been heard to say something like, ""That's something a grown-up wears."" I compliment Timex on this product!"
1,Bad,We all know its cheap but it looks pretty bad. Once can find better watches for the same price at Target
1,Broke within a Day,"My seven year old son only had one requirement for his watch. He wanted it in camo. My only requirement was that it be analog so that he could learn to tell time. He was so excited by this watch and so disappointed when it broke so quickly. Within a day the minute hand was spinning around when you tilted the watch. The watch band is also really cheap. It is essentially a strip of camo printed elastic. I doubt it would have lasted a week. Thankfully, MrWatch was so good about the return. We replaced it with a Timex T79051. My older son has had this model for several years without any problems. Now I just need to find a camo watch band."
3,Watch review,"The watch arrived with a dead battery. This was a Christmas gift for my grandson. We went to a jeweler and the battery was replaced for $19.00 . The jeweler said the battery checked out dead and had probably been on the shelf for a long time. After the battery was replaced, my grandson was very pleased with his new watch.Please make sure the watch has a new battery before it ships to buyer."
5,son's gift,this was a gift for my nine year old son. he loves it and so do i. the band is stretchie so he can easily take it off and on with out undoing the strap.
3,Stopped working,"I bought this for my son. But after 2 months it stopped working. It said it is waterproof, but our watch is obviously not! I do not recommend this watch."
4,Great learning tool,This watch is great for helping youngsters that are learning to tell time. My son was able to tell me the correct time just minutes after receiving the watch. The only problem is that the strap doesn't stay all that tight. I am constantly adjusting it for him. If the strap would stay tight I would give it a 5 all the way.
4,great watch for kids,"I got this for my 6 yr old son and loves this watch. He loves it so much he doesn't want to take it off, he even sleeps with it. He loves the cool indiglow. The helicopter second hand is really cute. Great that the band is adjustable and comfortable."
5,... I am the most AWESOME Grandma in the UNIVERSE!!,According to my 5yr old grandson... I'm at the top of his popular list. I gave my grandson his first watch as a Christmas gift and I wanted it to be a Timex. He's thrilled with it because he's learning to tell time and because it looks great. He reminds me constantly of how much he likes it. It's very boyish and his sisters have no interest in asking to wear it.
2,Has not aged well,"When C&K came out, it was a major event because it brought together scattered information in a decent graduate introduction. But it doesn't compare well to more recent books. It is relatively slow and important points don't stand out well. It would benefit from a lot more examples. And it is much too focused on ultraproducts. The third edition does very little to update it; it just adds sections 2.4, 2.5, 3.5, 4.4 and a few pages to the Open Problems and Historical Review. Reading C&K along with Marker, Hodges, and Poizat, I felt that C&K was the only one that added nothing interesting to the others. If you really need to read about ultraproducts, Hodges has a good description."
4,Listen several times.,"Forget Andy Gill's nasty review. This really is a fine recording, some of the most accessable atonal music I've ever heard. Voice, solo instrument, and orchestra shift, diverge, resolve, and move away again. More ambient than anything else, but not concerned with being nice. It did take me at least three listens to start to appreciate it, but once I did the pleasure has never diminished."
1,Not impressed,The seller was great. The product is poor. I was not impressed. The buttons are poorly marked and there were no instructions. I had no idea if all the buttons went up or went down or what button was used for what function. I was particularly not impressed with the rotation mechanism. It was clunky and not smooth.
5,Great stuff from sunn o))) members,I love it..starts slow and creepyThe picture of Atilla on the sleeve is enough to buy this!Oh..unlike most sunn o))) stuff(cause really this is just sunn under a different name!Ok greg anderson is not on this...THERE ARE DRUMS!!!IIf you like sunn o))) Run like hell get it..stunning!If not..go and go with an open mind..if possible high.And seeing Sunn or grave temple live for the first time..will change your life!Unless your rel thick skinned and only want to listen to rock songs!All these cds are work of a genius:stephen O'malley.First go and die of fear at their gig..then buy everything they ever brought ou!!!Insanely greatOn the Sunn scale..a 4 out of 5
1,Poor quality on these swings from Penn Plax,"Although ZPets delivered these as promised, the quality is poor.The swings separate from the hooks that hang them. Ordered 24 of these and 12 of them are not usable. I will contact ZPets about this fault.Canaries love this swing and ufortunatley it is dangerous to them when they come apart and they go crashing down unexpectedly."
4,Essential,"I still have two thumbs thanks to this. An absolutely essential woodworking product. Get two, you'll be glad you did."
2,Thumb guard,"Arrived quickly and as ordered, but not something I would have bought had I seen it in person first. Covers the thumb, but slips as you work. I will say I have not sut myself yet."
2,Great item,I bought this along with some other items. This has saved my thumb and finger many many times in my wood carving
2,well made product,Not quite what I was expecting. A well made product but the fit was a problem. Maybe I was using it wrong.
1,split seam,"I ordered this and loved the way it fit my thumb, but unfortunately, the cap seam has split within a couple hours of use."
4,"Great DVD sound, but so-so video quality...","If you're a Nightwish fan, this DVD is a must! It shows an electrifying concert with an amazing song collection, plus some great extras, including interesting interviews and video clips. I grew up listening to the metal ancestors, like Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, moved on to Iron Maiden and Impellitteri, then Hammerfall and Rhapsody. But, Nightwish is my all-time favorite metal band because of their incredible melodies and consistency of their albums."
4,Great performance - possible editorial issues,"I have watched this video twice and agree with reviewers believing that Tarja is not lip-singing. Her singing at times is not in sync with video but also instruments and musicians movements seem to be not matching the sound. These symptoms may be an indication of possible mistakes during editorial work resulting in occasional video not matching the audio. It is hard to state opinions like that because someone's reputation may suffer and causing harm to anyone would be the last thing I wanted. Some people blame video/audio differences on artist and I thought that maybe my observations could bring some balance to this discussion.The lack of video/audio synchronization takes away some quality from the experience, however Nightwish performance is good and for those willing to accept possible editorial deficiencies this DVD might still be worth buying as it was for me."
3,hm...,"I just got this dvd in the mail, and I watched it. I don't know why everyone's complaining about the sound. the sound is just fine. but it seems like tarja's mouth doesn't move along with the words. other than that, everything's fine. her voice is beautiful. the videos are interesting. the crowd just doesn't seem to be 'into' the music like they should be :/"
2,Excellent band but Very bad sound on this dvd,"Just to start. I have a very good system (amp and speakers) and the sound is horrible! I tried many setting and nothing seem to reach my expectation. I was really disappointed about this dvd and even regret that i bought it! Nightwish is one of my favorite band and i can't wait to see it live Decembre 16 2004 in Montreal to hear the real thing.I am really sad to say this but when you are use to good sound from their album, you expect at least the same if not better for a dvd."
2,disapointing,"Nightwish is one of my favorite bands on the planet. when i heard about their dvd, i bought it from Helion Records in Brazil while making another purchase. i couldn't wait to get it.watching them live was very exciting. i had never seen this band, aside from pictures from their website and cd booklets. and the songs were really well performed. my biggest problem was the sound quality. it was terrible!! i am so used to hearing their albums on my stereo with excellent bass, clear vocals, and defined drum beats. but the dvd sound quality didn't allow for any of that.i was very disapointed. but i suppose it's possible that i just bought a bad copy... in any case, i still love this band more than anything. i just really wish that their dvd was something i could stand watching and listening to."
2,"Awesome Band, Bad DVD","I don't know why everyone is complaining about the sound, the sound is fine!But the DVD is destroyed by the fact that the audio doesn't match up to the picture. It looks like an old dubbed chuck norris movie out of the 80's, I can't even watch it."
2,From Wishes to Eternity: Live,The reason that tarja's mouth doesn't move along with the words is that she's lip sinking. Other wise it was a good live concert.
4,Heavy reading,I needed to concentrate reading this. Was very interesting and I understood what the author was saying but very technical.i need to use this as reference. Not light reading.
1,MADE IN CHINA beware,"This is made in China. There is no information about this, when you order. How do we know that the glaze has no lead etc? I was hoping for a safe coffee mug with no plastics and I got China."
4,Book,"Interesting Read. Its for my college Rhetoric 100 classes and helps you see what you can really do with such a small subject like ""Blue Jeans""."
3,Missing one key thing...,"I bought this as study guide, and it didn't have an answer key... so the questions I wasn't sure of, I had no way of knowing whether or not I get them right without hours MORE research... I might be whining, but it would have been nice to have a key somewhere, or at least some info on where to find it."
2,Drug travelogue not needed,"Sorry, but though I keep trying (it's at least a trilogy, after all), this story is just not interesting. Castaneda talks about alternate reality, but I can talk about one too. He puts this story forward as a true record of a meaningful other world out there. All I see is a guided drug trip by a Mexican Indian friend. A magical ""ally"" in the shape of a giant gnat? Come on. If you're drugged out and doubled over on the floor, and a gnat lands next to your eyeball, I bet that's what he looks like.At best this is a drug travelogue. At worst it's mediocre science fiction. I admit I did learn one thing from his wise guide's musings -- that we all talk to ourselves -- at least in our heads, and it's a challenge to shut up and listen to the world around us. But again, no drugs needed for that."
4,Precusor to John Grisham,"This book is a little long, and parts of it are a 'plow'... but the courtroom scenes and other aspects sure remind one of Grisham, Great read"
5,Essential Jazz. Simply a Fabulous Collection,"Many ""best of"" CD's are lousy, but this CD is truly outstanding. You can make a case that this is the best jazz CD ever simply because of the superb selection of John Coltrane's best jazz during the prime mid-to-late years of his career. This CD is highly recommended by the ""Penguin Guide to Jazz,"" which is very unusual for a ""best of"" CD.Coltrane's albums are consistently rated among the greatest albums ever made, such as ""Giant Steps"" and ""A Love Supreme."" The song ""My Favorite Things"" gets my vote for ""best jazz song ever."" Coltrane should be heard by anyone even casually interested in jazz. This CD gives you a great collection of some of his best music.Outstanding!"
4,A joy-filled maestro!,"The single word that comes to mind whenever I listen to this recording is simply, 'joy'. Here's a collection of songs by a master musician, singing about the simple joys of everyday living... lived out in relationship with others around him. If you've not discovered the virtuoso guitar work of Phil Keaggy, give it a listen; you'll be glad you did."
5,Things we don't understand,"This book resulted from a conference held in Napa valley a few years before the book's publication. The editors and contributors examine critical issues in strategic management. Ten years later, these issues remain unresolved. This is because these issues are complex and enduring. Anyone interested in understanding enduring competitive advantage will benefit greatly by reading this book. One of its major contributions is that it delineates the boundaries of current understanding. To those looking for immediate help to their organizational problems this volume will offer few solutions. For those wanting to understand how firms behave, adapt, and organize for sustainable advantage this book will be a great start."
3,Purely for academics - report from a 22 year old conference,"This is a collected volume of presentations held 1990 by leading academics in the field of strategic management. It was a very good state of the academic field when the book was published in 1994. It was never supposed to be read by practitioners. Of course, the book is no longer a cutting edge description of the field. Still there might be a number of useful ideas in this book for doctoral students or students of management history. For those categories still four stars. For all others, this is a one star book."
5,Good Buy...,"It is a great way to show your children the world around them, and get them interested in our universe..."
5,Perfect!,My little brother is really getting into space and I thought I would help him by getting him lots of cool posters for his room. he loves them all including his space ones.
5,amazing,i didnt even know all of this and when i got it i was looking at it for an hour with my kids and we just love it
1,The worst experience ever,"I never arrived, Even worst, one of the posters arrived and the quality is so poor that you can see the pixels. Never again art poster."
4,Very Informative,"I recently purchased for my son's room. It is bright, informative and attractive. The information is not the easiest to read but if close enough it is legible. That might be a drawback in a classroom."
2,some inaccurate information,"this is a pretty poster with nice colors and graphics but some of the information printed is inaccurate.for example, pluto is listed as the 9th planet even though pluto was reclassified in 2006"
3,Pluto isn't a planet,"The poster is printed on okay paper. But, it lists Pluto as a planet. That is just unforgivable and dates the poster."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTING,"I BOUGHT FIVE MICROSCOPES, THE PRODUCT IS OK WITH THE PRICE, BUT I RECEIVED ONE OF THEM BROKEN AND ANOTHER ONE INCOMPLETE. IF YOU WANT TO COMPLAIN YOU MUST SEND THE PRODUCT BACK, THAT IS ALMOST THE SAME PRICE OF THE PRODUCT..... SO..... VERY DISSAPOINTING.-FRANCO SANTORO"
1,Run away fast!,"It is true, the software is useless and loading it took an evening of total frustration by a computer savy individual. The manual is in chinglish and is difficult to understand, the text does not mesh with the photos, and it has no troubleshooting. The lighting is blinding, even when the lighting disc is turned to the smallest aperature - useless.Don't even go there - you'll be frustrated and will be sending it back the next day like me."
1,too good to be true,"I did follow the instructions and after 2 cds from the supplier I still have no working camera. My IT dept said the cds are blank. I've seen the same camera on other websites for $200, just for the same camera. If the software does not work, it's no different than the same version for $75. What a shame and ripoff. I'm hopeful to obtain some working software on the 3rd try."
4,Beautiful art,"This video contains many kung fu fighting scenes from other movies such as Snake and Crane arts of Shaolin. Spiritual Kung Fu, New Fist of Fury, Shaolin Wooden Men, and more. Watching these fighting scenes is like watching a movies that have excited kung fu action from beginning to end. I recommend to anyone who likes kung fu."
4,Over Priced,"The it is cute and my daughter likes the saddle. Is is very over priced and should have been free shipping, then I might have given a better review. People are getting a bad deal without free shipping.But watch I wont buy anymore B stuff for a long time bad taste. Lance"
2,No horse included,"I thought that for this price, it came with the horse. It didn't. Saddle is adorable and fit another horse i bought, but it is kind of flimsy and way too much money for nothing but a saddle. I guess Breyer always gets a lot for their products, but this is too much for this product, in my opinion."
4,Standard Whey,"I buy this stuff at the gym because it is just easy to grab when i'm thinking about it. I like to have 2 scoops in 12oz of water mixed with a banana right after i work out. Alone, this stuff doesn't taste good at all, and to mix it you must have a blender.I also put one scoop of this in my oatmeal in the morning. Everyone working out needs whey, and this kind is pretty good. There are others out there with more protien per scoop, but they cost more. 19g compared to 24g. This stuff is worth a try."
4,A trip down memory lane?,"I thought that this novel was a overall well done piece of literature. Josephine Humphreys clearly shows the insecurities and subjects we have or will have in our lives. However, Lucile makes many false assumptions about life. Lucilles' character, I believe, would appeal much more to someone from an older generation who can realize some past believes that seem silly to them no. I found myself at times glued to the book but at other times wondering why Humphreys made Lucille so stupid. Having not completed adolescence I do not know if my conclusions on life are correct but I do believe that some of Lucilles are wrong and can only be appreciated by people who have made them as wel.."
3,Mildly interesting,"Sometimes, these coming of age books are over my emotional head. This one wanders and meanders around with the different characters being focused. Mother moves out abruptly, leaving the teen Lucille to cope with her dismayed father who has lost his license to drive due to excessive speed. Lucille must assume the role of female caretaker. Then her sister, Rae, arrives home with a husband and very pregnant. This compounds the situation. Father takes up with another woman, midway. Mother calls home frequently to chat but nothing is accomplished. Lucille has a somewhat boyfriend but eventually falls for Rae's husband and this makes things somewhat more interesting. The delivery of Rae's baby makes for an exciting scene, but overall the book just puddles along until it ends. Not one of HUmphries's best."
4,Worth a look,"This certainly isn't the best book I've ever read by any means, however it has a certain meaning to it and a nice crafting of the the story that it is most certainly a worthwile read. The characters I well made and complex and the setting is also very realistic. This is a great novel about change and accepting new circumstances."
3,"This book is entertaining,but has parts that are unrealistic","I thought that this book was enjoyable and it kept my interest. Humphreys sparked your attention by introducing new situations into the novel. I would never have guessed that Lucille would end up sleeping with her brother in law. Also, when her sister Rae told her she was supposed to be aborted, but since she had an unknown twin she was saved, was an interesting fact. Humphreys keeps the reader's attention by weaving in interesting facts throughout the novel. However, I believe that some of the aspects of Lucille's character were too advanced. Being a teenager in high school, and seventeen years old, I know few people that make such abnormal conclusions. Various times, Lucille had certain ideas about life and people that were very advanced. This part of her character made it hard to imagine that she was a realistic seventeen year old."
2,"Intriguing and eloquent, yet disappointing","This novel keeps the reader captivated in hopes that she will discover the details to the story that enables the main character, Lucille, to write a novel about a ""novel-worthy"" event in her life. However, even though there is an intriguing edge to the novel, I did find parts to be boring and prolonged. Furthermore, I also find it hard to believe that Lucille could be so anaylitically mature for her age. I feel betrayed after reading this novel because Lucille was introduced to me as an innocent girl, yet in the end she turned out to be more malicious and different than I had anticipated, which I found discouraging. I believe that this novel is great for learning about and sparking thoughts about love in the human mind, but if you want good entertainment I suggest you look elsewere."
2,Disappointing,"I found it very slow and boring in parts, very sad in parts and some parts had beautiful writing. I struggled through about half of it and quit. Not a book for me. Sorry."
3,run of the mill southern novel....,"something i read last spring. i liked it that the female protagonist was one of those "" wise beyond her years characters,"" though her character has become a cliche in itself in fiction. at least most southern fiction these are trying to show better relationships between blacks and whites and this one is ok. i thought that it handled the subject of divorce quite tactfully and how it affected all of the family members. it succeeds even in spite of the cliches"
4,"Great product, even better price","I got this yoga strap for about $2 from Amazon - unbeatable price. This is a nice length strap of sturdy construction. Mine is still relatively new so I'm hoping to break it in as the edges are a little stiff making it rough on smaller hands. Still, you can't beat the price and versatility."
5,Best for back-up wire,"This works perfectly for connecting to my modem/router, xbox 360, laptop, computer,..ect it's small but it gets the job done. If one of my original Ethernet cables get screwed up I can lay back and use this one or let my buddies barrow it."
1,not the best,my parrot had zero interest in sitting on this swing. the only thing he wanted to do was to knaw on it. i ended up trashing it after a few weeks.
2,Can Who do voodoo?,"The TARDIS arrives in Haiti in 1915, where current political events and ancient evil are mixing with disastrous outcomes...Another debut of a regular author, this book starts off looking like one thing and then changes... The concentration on local Haitian politics and zombis that initially dominate the book are both the surface manifestations of two much larger matters that reveal themselves as the book progresses.While well-thought through, the actual drama is not well-portrayed in this book. Matters arise and are fairly quickly and routinely resolved, and hence it fails to draw the reader in. Had Mr. McIntee had more experience, this would have been a better book."
3,"Good, but not what we ordered",We ordered the product shown in the picture and rec'd something similar. First time ordering from Amazon so unsure if this is common practice or a slip up. We ended up keeping the item sent. Very functional and pretty much what we were looking for.
5,Awesome!,"Not only is it an attractive addition to any desk, it also has a cover that slides out of the top segment to cover the shelving area. I love having papers ""out of sight"" for a simple and organized feel. You can either leave the organizer open, or shut the cover over the front when you are not using it.I would highly recommend this product to anyone!"
5,THIS BOOK IS HOT!!!!!!!,Blur is the best band and I love them and this book was kool so don't be a lazy wanker and buy it!
1,missing info,could not listen to the CD...you did not provide the option for reviewing/listening to the track listings
1,"Burkett is a paranoid, meglamaniac.","This book was the worst combination of words on paper that I have ever read. I could not believe someone this radical would be printed by a major publisher. The story of the EPA regulators was a front for Burkett to put forth his Hitler-esque views of the way America should be, liberals and people who disagree with him be damned. The chilling endorsement of radical right wing extremists ala Ruby Rudge and Waco did nothing more than allow me to chuckle at Burkett's own self importance. The ending was purely twisted and bolstered my belief that anyone with a manuscript and very little intelligence can be published."
4,Great service saved the day,I have had two problems with this card that may or may not affect others. I had an old version of Mapsource that did not recognize the 64MB cards. A call to customer service pointed me to a free update. I had difficulty with the card in my unit. The unit was acting very flaky. A call to Garmin customer service resulted in getting a in Warranty repair for an old unit. Some specific older units (the StreetPilot Colormap) do not properly handle cards with greater than 16MB capacities.Why didn't I rate 5 stars? It take 4 hours to load the card over a serial link. The USB programmer is a bit pricy but would really make life much easier. I think for my needs I can get by without it. If you need program the card often you will want it for sure.
5,Well worth the wait!,"I waited a long time to get the complete 1st series of this great show; and am very happy with this DVD-set. As you can see it is on proper single-sided DVDs with a picture on each DVD. And all 24 episodes. Now if only they will release the other episodes (made in the 1980s, the 2nd to 4th seasons aren't as likely to be released, but hopefully will)."
3,found this for free on youtube,"i watched this with my kids and then my 12yr old found it on youtube for free, not as good quality but free"
3,Spanish Translation Forgotten,"I'm buying every toon collection I saw as a kid, but only when it includes what we Mexicans remember as the original dub (Televisa dub). This has been done with Top Cat, The Flintstones, etc... And they are sold like salt&sugar here in Mexico! That's because I'm giving it a 3 star, it would be a winner with the 'original mexican dub' just like the other series."
2,Is this the original?,"While looking at who supplied the voices, I did not see Janet Waldo who was the voice of Judy Jetson or Jean Van Der Pyle who was Rosie. I want to order The Jetsons but not if it's not the original. If anyone out there knows, please share another review. Thanks"
1,Phony Jetson cartoons,"This entire set has not one cartoon from the original series. These cartoons are all pathetic remakes of the original, hilarious series. It is a travesty that they can be sold as ""The First Complete Season"". They must be the first complete season of remakes. I saw the original Jetsons as a kid and when I started watching what is contained in this set---forget about it!!! I would have asked for my money back but the kid I bought it for wanted to keep it--since he didn't know the REAL JETSONS."
4,Flash from my childhood,This is so fun to watch. I loved the Jetsons as a child and wanted to relive some of the younger days. This was great to see some clasic cartoons again...to bad they are not on the air anymore..
5,The Jetsons-first season,I watched this family light up space over 40 years ago so I was pleasantly surprised when my daughter had a chance to watch one episode and she got hooked. I made the purchase and it has been non stop George for weeks. She also had a chance to see a episode of the Flintstones and believe me Fred should be at my house in a few weeks. In this age of high tech toys and tv shows with so much sexual content its wonderful to see that simple humor and silly situations can still bring a smile to a child.
5,Great DVD,I love this DVD set. My kids had never seen the Jetsons before. They look forward to each episode now that we own the first complete season. I look forward to owning season two when it is released.
1,BEWARE PHONY SONY BALONEY ABOUT SXRD LAMP LIFE,"The lamp for my SXRD 60A2000 last just one week longer than the 1-yr warranty period. Without warning it just went Phht. So much for the lamp warning message Sony so proudly yaks about it the manual. BALONEY.4 hrs a day should have gotten me 3_ years. But reality is just 1 yr of service per lamp and then you have to spend 10-percent plus of original sale price to replace each year. I would never have bought this TV if I knew I would have to do that.PLUS, the phoney sony baloney people at sony style said my extended warranty would cover lamp replacements...but now of course they do not cover ""consummables"" (i.e. lamp replacements)Run away as fast as you can fgrom PHONY SONY BALONEYYes I am a disgruntled customer and you will be too!"
2,Lamp blew after 18 months,"Without warning the lamp went. We were nowhere near the 8,000 hours of use that SONY predicts the lamp will serve us before it burns out.Went to the store where I bought it and spoke to the same salesman who sold it to us. He didn't say a word. Took my paperwork walked over to three different computers and typed in a bunch of numbers and letters in each one. He wrote a phone number down and handed my paperwork back to me. He would not have said a word except I inquired if this was common for the lamp to go so soon. He told me that the lamp on his TV was five years old and he had heard of others lasting a year or less. Not very comforting.Called the number and spoke to a woamn who didn't want to hear about complaints she only took orders. So for $285.49 I get a new lamp in two working days. Not happy at all. Will not buy another SONY or go to Bernies again."
2,Lovely sight but confusing,"When I saw this book it cought my attention immediately, the title couldn't suit me better and the art on the cover is magnificently gorgeous. However dissapointed afterwards at all the myth about the Fae! It's a mixture of a bit of truth and a lot of myth and superstition.The rituals are somewhat nice and it contains some interesting information such as the Faery Dictionary, not that I think anyone CAN put faeries into a dictionary lol. Overall it's a nice book to read if you want to learn about faery myth and superstition."
5,Interesting handguide,"A Witch's Guide to Faery Folk is a rich, detailed, book on exploring and working with the world of faery folk. It is not just a dictionary to 230 faeries but also has hints and helpful information on how to find them, make friends with them, and involve them in the spells and magic you creat.It also has tons of information on mediation, how to travel in Faeryland, and how to protect you home and loved ones from the darker, unfriendly, forces among the faery.Get it used or new. Even if you don't believe, it is still fun to read."
1,Terrible! Total turn off!,"The reading in this book was interesting enough, but it was hardly a decent work on the subject! It was more like fantasy, and McCoy should have marketed it as the fiction it is!"
2,much better resources available,"Written in fourth-grader style, not well researched, and frequently inaccurate. Author quotes books of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose, Brian Froud, the 'Enchanted World' series of Time-Life books, and her own works in the bibliography; the closest this book gets to genuine research is an abridged version of Frazer and a speculative work of Joseph Campbell's.Use this book for magic at your own risk!Or, save yourself the trouble of having to relearn the right information later, and instead buy a copy of Alexander Porteous' The Forest in Folklore and Mythology."
5,An Answer to an Age of Extremism,"In an age of religious extremism, where every little group is convinced that it is the holder of the Truth, and every other group is mortally and sinfully wrong, this book presents an opportunity for discussion with your children. It does not answer what The Truth is (well maybe minimally). It discusses what it means to fervantly believe in a ""broken truth"" an incompete truth, that in the end puts you at odds with everyone else. It is an excellent lead in to the discussion of how it could be that human war over Truth (as if Truth needs assistance from Humans and guns)."
5,A Quest for THE Truth,"Themes: diversity, community, culture, quest for truthContent areas: Language Art- (upper elementary) - teacher read aloud and discussion activities, genre studies (fable), Social Studies- community, Art- color, shadow, Guidance- acceptance, diversityA wise old turtle knows the complete truth. Unfortunately, the creatures of the world do not. Various animals at least know a part is missing. Humans don't even realize they are worshiping a broken truth. This is ultimately about one girl's journey to understand why there is so much pain/war/unhappiness.Wood seems to be pushing hard to be profound, and in the end the story just doesn't quite flow. However, Jon J. Muth's beautiful, watercolor illustrations add an almost haunting quality to the story, which helps pull together the meaning and significance of the unbroken truth."
5,"You want a ball or a bat, a doll or a hat, it's in the Santa sack.","Your search for the perfect Christmas album is over.""Christmas Rap Music,"" the lone studio album by the sadly short-lived hip-hop collective known as Crew X, is a nonstop breakneck ride of Yuletide joy. When the 808 starts slammin' and those funky breaks and wild synths come bangin' out your box, you'll have no choice but to jam along with the Crew with your head bobbing as they fill your ears and heart with warmth, the spirit of giving, and of course the glowing love of Our Lord.Record label bigwigs never have their finger on the true pulse of the streets, and this record is another casualty of that; ""Christmas Rap Music"" has fallen out of print. It's rare and sure to become a collector's item, so cop it while you can! And on Christmas morning, get yo' drink on (egg nog of course LOL!1), press play, open some presents, and get hiiiiii-iiiiiiigh on love, generosity, and that special togetherness that only comes but once a yaer."
3,Car adapter,"It definitely works and it's worth the money for the application (using the laptop for the kids to view movies). My only complaint is that it's VERY tight in the car outlet, so if you don't pull it out just so, it comes apart. But if you're careful, it's fine (I just don't let my wife do it any more :)). Like the other posters said: The sound of the fan is forgotten very quickly as you're on the road."
5,Nothing but the Hits,"Every selection on this CD is excellent. That is rare for a CD, but the title says it all....Nothing But the Hits!!"
5,nice services,"this transaction was very pleasant, as the c d was in wonderful condition. will gladly do business this seller again. thank, freda"
5,I am so glad I got this book!,"I personally have read this book! The Authors have real insight and understand music more than I thought music could be understood. this book unlocks the secrets of how to compose music like the greats do(or did) - like Led Zepplin or The Eagles. timeless secrets that put it all into reach. Even though this book covers how to read and write music, it gets advanced in an amazing curve that you can follow, and ends with advanced concepts that are above the norm."
2,Not what was expected,"I bought this CD after listening to one of the songs remixes. I expected somthing more of a trip-hop nature. Nidless to say I was complitely disapointed with the style of the Grizzly Bear, wainy and mindnumbing. But I have nobody to blaime, but myself. Should of listen to more samples. I guess this type of music is way too depressive for my taste. I doubt I will ever listen to this CD again."
5,A NEW BOOK ON THIS MASTERFUL COLLECTION FOR KIDS!,"I can't believe it, but each one is as good as the one before!The drawings ( for coloring ) OF THIS NUMBER 7, ARE REALLY WONDERFUL AND INSPIRING FOR KIDS !The jokes?They are child designed...But so witty, I layghed my head with many of them along with my 7 year old boy !"
2,UGH ! ! !,"I own a restrauant and we use these hammers to break up big clumps of ice. One came with the handle loose at the head; and the other one had a big crack in the handle, 4"" long.A friend got me 2 more for half the price and no defaults. If it would be worth my time and trouble I would demand my money back. I'm just to busy to deal with the little stuff.Buyer beware.Thank you for listening."
2,Unclear scope,The definitive book about the effect of death on human culture is Becker's Denial of Death. This meandering tome pales in comparison.
2,Don't understand the positive reviews,"Apparently the lead actor in this movie is famous in Australia or something, but I've never heard of him before this. It seems like the other reviews are written by young girls who like him.The storyline seems a little old at this point, the actor doesn't come off as much of a ""victim"" considering that he did sleep with the girl. Which also brings up the point of *how* exactly did he sleep with her?Cliche scenes that have been done many times before, not scary."
2,Not worth your time,"The description of the movie sounded like it would be interesting, but after watching it, I was seriously disappointed. Most of the movie moves very slowly, but then the end is very abrupt. It would have been much better if there was more of a build up throughout the movie, and also if the ending would have gone on a little longer. The way it is presented is like they ran out of money and had to cut it where they did and left it incomplete. I may not have felt that way if they would have explained things a little better, but this film was very poorly constructed."
4,"Great for a Diego fan, but a child cannot open the case","We really like this animal carry case for our 3-year old. The animals certainly won't spill out as it is quite difficult for even an adult to open. A child really can't open it. I think our child would play with it more if he could open it himself. He likes the sounds it makes and I like that there is a switch to turn the sounds off if necessary. Overall, a very nice toy."
5,"Remarkable, terrifying, gripping, and thoroughly enjoyable",Well drawn characters in an extraordinary situation. Large in scope with careful attention to detail. Like her first book (Branch Point) a thoroughly enjoyable read.
2,"Read David Brin's ""Earth"" instead.","Bleh. I finished the book, but only because I wanted to find out about the Green Man. The book is pedantic and preachy. I didn't like the narrator, Moira, who seems 40, not 80, and who acts really dense a lot of the time so that some other character has an excuse to give a little environmental or spiritual discourse. And all her juvenile slang got on my nerves after a while.If you want a good book on collapsing civilization, with spiritual themes and with a much smarter and more interesting female narrator, try Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower"" (occasionally preachy too, but not even close to ""Overshoot""). Or read David Brin's ""Earth,"" another good book on near-future North America, with strong environmental themes and with all sorts of other neat speculation also."
5,I liked it!,"Mona Clee's novel is a wonderful evocation of a possible future. The tale gives us a warning about shaping up or getting shipped out, so to speak, but Clee also throws us a lifesaver: a hope that we can turn things around before it's too late. This book demonstrates how we are all connected to one another and to the planet. Buy it! Kim Antieau"
5,"Ecological, insightful and fun",A must read! I'm sick of people talking about El Nino when it's really global warming. I think Mona is right on. Very entertaining book.
4,Overrated,"I had this recording for years but could never warm to it. Perahia and his companions play a fine, poetic version of a work that Mozart said was the best thing he had written to date, but are let down by an overly spacious sound picture. The winds sound like distant bystanders, and a good rather than great performance is not enough to overcome this. Perhaps Perahia's reputation has elevated the status of this recording beyond its true merit. A decent version, but not one that can eclipse the very best rivals. Try the classic version with Gieseking on Testament if you want to hear a performance that can render you unmindful of lackluster sound."
2,"Poor ensemble,poor recording...","There is very little to speak about this performance except that perahia is a well known artist.the recording is poor and the volume level has to be cranked way up to listen comfortably!The ensemble is poor and despite playing these works at a slower pace they do not gel!For a knockout performance of these beautiful works i recommend the Melodya recording of these works by Eliso Virsaladze(piano),anatoli Lubimov(oboe),Vladimir Sokolov(clarinet),anatoli Demin(French horn)and Sergei Krasavin(basoon).Recorded in 1975 this is a superb performance where the entire ensemble are in peak form and take these two works with a gay abandon .There is Dramatic and sensitive piano playing(not matched by Perahia!),a piercing oboe,a gliding clarinet,a sombre horn and a bassy basoon.I have only a compact Cassette of this recording and it is better than this DDD compact Disk!Just goes to show that technology and fame are not enough to match Quality Music Making!"
3,Cash Flow has been Life changing ....for some.,We need more time to evaluate this game fairly. It's difficult to motivate youngsters who seem addicted to electronics to sit down with a board game. I haven't given up yet.
2,More Work than Fun,"I bought this game for my ten-year-old grandson, and we played, with his 12-year-old brother. Having played a lot of different kinds of board games with them, I know what they like and can tell how they feel about games.This game was way too much work for the amount of fun it delivered. The banker is working all the time, giving out money, taking in money, and a zillion other duties. Nearly every turn on the board necessitates financial transactions. There's not much suspense or competition--when someone won it was almost anticlimactic. I doubt the kids are going to be playing the game much. Sure, it's educational--but they won't learn its lessons if they don't play it, and if it isn't enough fun, they won't play. You can't fool kids. I don't recommend this game except maybe for lessons taught in school."
1,It's not what they say it is...,"expensive, I thought the price can be justify for what my children will learn.... No, it is expensive, very basic and easy my children and me used only twice ..it's absolutly boring and out of realistic teachings.... lost my money"
5,Must Have to educate your children,This game is great for teaching some complex financial concepts in a fun and repetitive fashion. We like playing this game with our son. Hopefully he'll buy his own property at an earlier age and avoid all the pitfalls of a life with less than an optimum understanding of money and how to utilize this tool.
4,Learning Tool,"Purchased for 6-8 graders in a summer camp. Kids loved the game after several stops and starts. It would be great if there were short web videos about the history of the game development, it's developer, some basic concepts, etc. I had to create a video from several YouTube videos of ""rich dad poor dad"" to give to kids an idea of the purpose of the game and it's concepts.We are thinking of forming local teams to compete and to learn more about ""cash flow"". Cheers..."
2,8th grade education required to understand.,"This was a good read, but it is not instructions on how to play the game it is more of a break down of rich dad poor dad."
1,Not for over 25!,"I am 35 and found this video very frustrating. The beginning is a good warm up with interesting Tai chi moves. The dance part is all instruction on learning one routine, taking 20 minutes, then executing it only once. I was sweating very little. The camera angle moves right when you really need it, away from the dancers bodies , to thier faces. I would not recommend this video. However my 7 year old liked watching the group C-Note perform at the end."
3,Worst of all the Grind Tapes....,I think this is the worst Grind video ever made. I don't care for C-Note in it and I don't like the fact that Eric is not in this one as he is a great workout leader. It is also a boring video as it tends to drag on and on and then when it gets good if you have carpet some moves can be hard to do. My advise is to skip this one and go for one of the other Grind videos.
1,A NO-BUY!,"When I bought this video, I expected it to be great. I love kickboxing, and I have been dancing since I was three. (I am thirteen now.)I am an advanced dancer, and the moves were nearly impossible. This is not because they were too difficult, but they only show you the move once, and then go into ""hyperspeed."" Also, the awkward camera angles were horrible. Half the time they showed C-Note when I was trying to master the steps.C-Note is a joke. They talk about the ancient martial art forms when it is obvious they have no clue what they're talking about. And if I hear those guys say, ""Y'all"" one more time, I'm chucking the tai funk aerobics tape out the window. That movement with my arm would give me about the level of fitness I reached with C-Note."
2,don't waste money and time with this one,"There are much better workout video's out there. I found this dvd a waste of my money. I have only watched it once, and found it to be hard to follow and interesting if you where a teenager!"
1,Work up a sweat with 12-40 second routines? Not!,"I bought this DVD because there were only 2 other exercise DVD's in existence at the time. ""MTV"" seemed to imply a vigorous ""youthful"" workout. I'm 47. I didn't even work up a sweat. The first 30 minutes revealed routines lasting from 12-15 seconds, repeated only twice. The last 5 minutes consisted of four 40 second routines. This is not what I call aerobic exercise. Save your money! Shame, MTV!"
3,Not what I thought I was getting,"Arrived on time but the quality wasn't what I expected. There are dark dots within the glaze and on the plate which I didn't expect. Since I planned on using this with my formal china, the dark spots are a bit of an eyesore. Would be better used for casual use. Would not buy again."
3,Not bad,"The detail in this product is not bad. The point of the product is for offshore navaids. It is of limited detail for inland regions. Other MapSource software are better for that. The trip and waypoint management functions are great. It is fun to transfer your tracks to the PC to see where you have been. If you are considering buying this, be sure to check out Garmin's online MapSource Map Viewer on the cartography page of their website. It shows the detail in the product. It can help you determine if the software is right for you. I would recommend their GPSMAP 76 unit without hesitation. It is great GPS unit!"
2,Kind of disappoinitng,"After using Garmin's US Roads and Recreation software, I expected more from this one than I got. Quite a bit of the information is already available in Roads and Rec., and U. S. waterways doesn't have that much more. It misses many boat launch sites in CT, doesn't show many other features as described in the earlier review, and doesn't show major marine features such as natural and artificial reefs. I think Garmin coud have done a much better job with the space on the CD."
3,IT RUSTS!!!!!,"This is a KICKASS JUICER.. but BE WARNED: It is NOT stainless steel.. it is STEEL. it WILL oxidize. You have to dry it with EVERY SINGLE USE, which is tedious, but only takes a few minutes. FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY DRY WILL RESULT IN RUSTING!!!!I learned this the hard way. Good bye $400.00 Wheatgrass Juicer =[[[ Now my arm is sore from cranking."
3,Decent overview,"Like the other DVD's in this series, could use more detail as this DVD is an overview. I expected more in the way of content. Good material, just not a lot of it."
2,Basic and outdated,I am a collegiate sprints and hurdles coach. The information in this video will probably only help those who are relatively new to coaching. It is very basic. The training programs and weightlifitng are also incredibly outdated. There are probably a lot of better sprint videos out there than this one.
4,"AK Anne Klein Women's Norvell,Black Nubuck,10 M","This boot is good for the winter, its comfortable and easy to care."
4,"Incredible album, I love it!!","I didn't rate this a 5 star album just because there are some songs that I don't really like, but also there is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my whole life... ""THE SWARM"".This song makes me feel the adrenaline in my veins and also the hatred and scorn of my soul. Great production and great music by this Gods of Death Metal. They may Rest In Peace!"
3,great representation of Swedish metal....,"I was first introduced to AT The Gates along with others like Dissection, Hypocrisy, Emperor, Dark Tranquility, Edge of Sanity, etc. Along with ATG, all these other bands are my ""mother's milk"", so to speak. Since ATG was one of my first introductions to Swedish Metal, I think that's why this album is so close to me. It's got great guitar lines, good, screaming vocals, and a drummer to match. I am especially fond of acoustic guitar work on albums like this, and ""As the World Returns"" is haunting, and beautiful all at the same time. Good use of the Cello, too. If you haven't experienced ATG yet, try ""Slaughter of the Soul"" first. That's a much more engrossing experience. But I still have to say that ""Terminal Spirit Disease"" is not bad. NOT bad at all."
4,emotional black metal,"At the gates has a very dark sound, with lots of emotional undertones, if you are a fan of speed metal or dark music in genral, this is a most own. All i can say is... destortion violin!"
3,"At the Gates has done better, but if you don't own it....","This album by ""At the gates"" does not compare to ""Slaughter of the Soul"" so if you are trying to decide which to get.. there you go. But.. everyone should own all of their cd's and their are some incredible melodic riffs on this disc including an acoustic that involves to acoustics, a chelo and a violin.. and if you are familiar with ""At The Gates"" you know this one will be good. Thanx"
4,The Experience,"As a reader of Dr. Blackaby's this journal/book ids a great resource for teens, college age and young adults serious about going deeper in their relationship with God. A great resource for a journey with God."
3,pretty,"These earrings were for a customer who asked me to find a pair of flower posts with amethyst in them. They were exactly what she wanted, which made me look good!"
4,Not bad,"For 15 dallors, it's a pair of beautiful earrings, although not looks exactly the same as the picture."
2,What am I missing?,"I think it is very admirable that Marsalis has attempted to produce a classical CD, however, this is not the sublime, masterpiece that so many previous reviewers have labelled it. His tone is particularly unstable, and not very even, his soprano playing is miles better than his alto however. This is a real shame, as the primary solo instrument in the saxophone family is the alto, anyone beginning study in classical saxophone would need to get this sorted first. His tuning is barely acceptable, but only for a jazzo, he would be shot if he played so out for a real saxophone teacher. Please have a listen to some real repertoire for saxophone, played by a real player, such as Bornkamp, Rousseau, Delangle, Fourmeau, Michat, Londeix, etc. This is a good INTRODUCTION to classical music, if for the first time, but please don't accept this as being the be all and end all of classical music, and of saxophone."
2,Far worse than I expected...,"This album is very disappointing. The soprano saxophone's nasal oboe-like sound on this seems quite out of character with the music it's supposed to be playing. The ""snippet"" or ""best-of"" approach to classical music this disc takes is also lacking in any regard for the integrity of the music. If you want to hear Bradford Marsalis in a classical setting, get his cd ""Creation,"" with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. As one might expect from their other wonderful collaborations (Goode, Maisky, etc), it's far better in terms of artistry and musical selection."
5,If you own just one classical Saxophone CD,"I do like classical music. I have had this CD for a number of years and it is still great. The soprano sax is a difficult instrument to play in tune and Marsalis does that and with a wonderful tone, too."
4,"Don't be misled. This is a classical, not a jazz album.","Branford Marsalis plays with all sensitivity and expression. Whether an orchestra or a chorus behind him. The album is characterized by dramatic interludes. He plays ""Claire de Lune"" by Debussy heartfelt exhibiting great range with a harp accompaniment. The ensemble is perfect. Due to the nature of the instrument, coloring is soulful and mournful throughout. Marsalis handles the phrasing well but does not overcome the limitations of his instrument. If you're looking for ""hot, down and dirty Sax"", this is not the album you are looking for. If you are looking to expand your collection of classical music, it is."
3,Too Much Sugar,"I must agree with the reviewer of 09/08/08: This disc is a bland one. The only work of any great interest, to my taste, is the collection of Old American Songs, but these performances are quite unmemorable, and to the extent that this album is engaging is because of the songs themselves rather than the performances. Along with that other reviewer, I suggest you go with the renditions of the Songs conducted by the composer himself with William Warfield as vocal soloist."
5,"Copland: Old American Songs, 4 Motets, etc / Tilson Thomas","Truly a masterful example of the great American Songs. The choir as no instrument bring the simple melodies and words alive. This music is a grand celebration of America, Aaron Copeland's magic touch and the voices of angels on high."
3,Mediocre at best,"As with all Kicker products, this only ranges in mediocrity. The wires and plugs themselves transmit clean signal, which is the best part -- but the cable in its entirety is terrible.First off, the packaging is one of those super-multi-ouch plastic packages that are VERY sharp when you cut them. It's also very hard to get a good side cut off.The covering they use on the cable itself is some sort of cheap silicone that is very gooey to the touch, and stays that way. Feels very unpleasant to work with. The twist ties that bound it together to keep it neat actually sunk in through the silicone and at one twisted end, ended up ""cutting"" through the cable. Not damaging the wires, but the silicone sheath has been compromised.Overall, I ended up getting this for about 2 bucks on a sale, but i wouldn't recommend it for any more than 5 dollars total. At its current price of ~20 it's a bit excessive."
4,"Great television, BUT..........","So I spent countless hours researching every TV on the market. I finally decided on this TV when I was in Circuit City. While I was there I happened to bump into a technician that installs the TV's for C.C. and Best Buy. He told me that this TV was great, but after a couple of years you would notice a deterioration of the monitor quality(i.e. green streaks). He said to go to Best Buy and look at the display TVs that have been on the floor for more than 2000 hours. He recommended the Samsung HL-S5687W 56"" 1080p DLP HDTV or a Pioneer Plasma(if I could afford it). Just ordered my Samsung yesterday from Amazon with the stand for $2183. Not a bad deal, although I will have to buy a new bulb every 5000 hours.I still think that this Sony is the better TV, but not in the long run."
1,Eagle delivery sucks,I have no review of the TV since I did not receive it. This is a rating on eagle delivery that lost the TV and would not give me straight answer for two weeks. I had to find out from amazon what had happened.
2,Picture is fuzzy,"None HD channel are not clear at all!!!After I bought this TV, I have read bad reviewes about it.I do not recommend this TV to anybody."
3,Buy LCD instead,Beware of the fact that the lamp may need replacement every year or so! It costs around $200 and is supposed to last 3 years/5000 hours but I went through two lamps in three years on my older LCD projection model...will see how long the current one lasts.
4,Great TV,"Very happy. Not a videophile, and haven't yet had the TV calibrated(or got ambitious and tried to do it with an affordable DVD kit), but pleased overall with the set. It has a good picture for watching movies, I hardly watch network programming, so I can't really comment on the display for SD signals. I currently use a DVD upconverter for watching movies in 1080p. Look forward to the day that DVD players that can utilize that format are affordable. Recommend set based on price and value, although one should consult further reviews if they have an interest in watching cable/antenna programming."
2,All will fail.... Eventually,"All of these have organic liquid crystals for color reproduction, and eventually the heat and time cause them to degrade and turn colors...like yellow and green. So, you're better off plugging that money of yours toward a decent plasma or LCD than these old SXRD rear-projection sets. I own one and settled for a new LCD 55"" from Sony as part of the class action lawsuit. Google SXRD and ""green blob"" to read more...."
4,Very disappointed about the service provided by Amazon,"I ordered the Sony KDS-60A2000 on November 24, 2006. I recieved the TV on December 2nd, several days ahead of schedule. When the delivery guys took the TV out from the box, nothing was inside the box except the TV. No user's manual, remote control, warranty card, etc. I called Amazon immediately and was told to call Sony directly! I left a message to the Amazon's customer service and still have not heard from them!I suspect that the TV that I received is an open box item. When they put the TV back into the box, they forgot about the remote and manuals. This is not right. I supposed to have received a brand new TV!The rating is supposed to be 2 stars instead of 4!!!"
4,Laid back,"A very nice listening experience. Perhaps the best track is ""Lawns"" featuring Larry Willis on piano,a version of which John Scofield does on his new CD A Moments Peace.Other tracks feature the late great Hiram Bullock on guitar.Carla Bley-Organ, Hiram Bullock-Guitar,Larry Willis-Piano,Steve Swallow-Bass,Victor Lewis-Drums ,Don Alias-Percussion."
5,She has my attention!,"I was unaware of Ms. Bley and her musical talents,as I do love jazz and avante-garde music. This lady really has it going on, her music is not only refreshingly different, but also outstandingly suave,I think is the best way to put it. I think her melodius tone will bend anyones ear who likes cool jazz."
1,Giottos RC-2020 review,The power On/Off button does not work to turn the camcorder on. The zoom is sluggish. I received the unit with missing clamp. I'm returning the unit back to the seller.
2,I bought this phone not working at all and I checked the connection wire was wrong.,I bought two items; one was digital answering machine but phone could not if I return this phone cost shipping not worthy.
2,"Cheaply made, but low priced","This is a very basic phone which does not need external power to function, which is good if you have a power failure.It works, but they seem to have cut a lot of corners in the manufacturing. The base is very light and slides easily on the table if you pull too hard on the handset cord. It needs some added weight. The major electronics are in the handset, not the base. The keypad hardly lights up at all. It's barely useful in the dark, but better than nothing I suppose. The handset cord could be longer I think. The buttons feel kind of cheaply made too.The price is reasonable if you qualify for free super saver shipping. It looks OK externally. A nice white color. This would be fine for emergency use or a rarely used extension, but I wouldn't consider it good for something to be used every day."
1,not so great for great-grandma,"I bought 2 of these phones for my mom. She needed a light-up keypad since she has cataracts. The light inside the phone only illuminates a couple of numbers, and then not very brightly. She also did not like the ringtone. She prefers a ringtone of older standard phones, which is why I chose the Trimline. It's a classic style that I expected to meet her expectaions. It did not, and my 30 days from ordering it were up, so I could not return them, so I passed the phones on to my daughter for her new house."
2,Can't program Memory,"I purchased this phone through Amazon from Atlanta Network Technologies. The telephone works but the memory couldn't be programed to save numbers. I have not returned the phone for a refund because the shipping cost, which I have to pay, is as much as I paid for the phone. So much for a good deal."
3,keypad was not lit enough,The phone seems fine but the keypad was not lit enough in an emergency situation for me to dial and had to resort to another phone. The older version is much better.
1,No one ever notified me,"This item never arrived. I emailed the supplier, Polsteins Home and Beyond, they never got back to me. It was to arrive a month ago. I finally looked them up and got their phone number. They said the item was discontinued. They also said they wrote an email on the 9th telling me that it was discontinued. I didn't get one.The phone was for my mother who is elderly and in desperate need of a phone like this. Days mattered.I order a lot of stuff through Amazon. This is an experience that will make me question whether they are good for things like this."
3,"Basic, but servicable","For the price, this phone serves its purpose well. The one thing that keeps it from getting five stars is that the phone does not have an off/on switch."
1,It's true...you get what you pay for,"This review is NO reflection on the seller just the product. It was cheap but I bought it anyway going against my standars. It broke in 3 days! My advice, spend a little more money and get a better phone."
4,Excellent basic phone,"This is a great phone. Memory is easy to progam. The phone has 3 memory keys for emergenies and 9 additional memory keys for personal numbers. It can be used on a desk or hung on the wall. The only thing I don't like about the phone is the buttons on the handset. However, I knew about this feature before purchasing the phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a good basic phone."
3,Adequate,"Due to a very limited space for a wall phone, this one serves the purpose very well. However, having purchased several of them in the last few years I have to say they do not hold up to constant usage. They meet my needs and the price is reasonable so until I can find another phone that fits my requirements I will probably continue to use this model - at the moment I have two ""spares."" Hopefully that will serve me for 3-4 years."
4,Great backup phone....,when your cordless goes out on you...this is a great little back up phone...real clear sound.
5,Good basic phone,"We needed a basic phone for a rental home, and it fits the bill. Works fine, and the price is right!"
5,They Work! They do not get lost!,"They Work! They do not get lost!They hang on the wall are easy to find, and function as well as any phone when one wants to simply talk."
3,Disappointed,"I really wanted this phone because its what I grew up with. It works fine, until you have to diala number with a 2 in it. lol. Since I don't use a landline often, it was awhile before I realized this andthen it wasn't worth sending back."
1,Don't buy for wall mount!,"This phone is okay for a cheap phone, but on a wall mount, the receiver will NOT stay on the base, it just falls off."
1,chinese junk,this phone is similar to a toy a child may get with a kids meal at a fast food restraunt. call waiting never worked and phone was super cheapy (hopefully not toxic). not made by att. for good simple phone try Cortelco 2500. made in usa and has worked well.
5,AT&T Corded Phone,These AT&T; Corded phones work bester than the off brands and last a longtime. The delivery was quick and I am very happy with them.Thanks Mike
4,oldie but goodie,"We bought one of these phones in 1980 when we built the house. It was still working as a phone, but the ringer broke. The new one is not as durable as the old one, but it seems to be working fine so far."
2,Good price but poor quality.,I bought it for the price but I would have bought something a little bit more expensive because it's really poor quality. We only use in case of emergencies but I put it away if I don't use it because I don't really like it.
5,Very phone-like!,"If you're looking for a basic phone that rings and can be dialed from, this is the telephone for you!"
1,Static Electricity will Kill this Phone -- Quickly !,"My wife bought two AT&T model 210 Corded phones, from Amazon, in the last month. Both died in less than a week. This model of phone appears to be EXTREMELY fragile, where static electricity is concerned! One time they may ring, and work; and the very next time, you pick them up, and they are dead. We do live in a part of the country that is very dry; especially in winter. As a result, static electricity is inevitable here. If you are aware of even small amounts of static electricity in your part of the country, I would urge you NOT to buy this model of phone. Sadly, it really is a ridiculously fragile piece of junk."
1,Cheap Junk!,"Do not purchase this phone - it is a piece of cheap junk - dial tone button hangs - I took to next door neighbor, former SWB repairman, he took a look inside and said it was not worth throwing away - I did anyway and made a trip to Radio Shack and bought another phone, probably another piece of foreign make cheap junk."
1,Don't bother trying to wall mount this,"The product description says ""You can place the base on a convenient surface or easily mount it on the wall, saving on counter space.""NOT TRUE.We bought this phone specifically to mount on our kitchen wall, but it doesn't work at all as a wall mounted phone.Well, yes, you can mount the base on the wall. But then when you try to place the phone receiver unit in the base, it falls right out. Not even close."
4,"Simple, economical, and compact","The title of this review says it all. I only wish there was a way to silence the ringer, but I can't complain too much about a phone this cheap."
5,great for hearing assist,My mother's hearing impairment disappears when she uses this volume adjustable phone. Better than more expensive volume adjustable models. A gift for every hearing-impaired person you know. Great value. Phone has lasted years and years!
1,PHONE,"The telephones dial tone would go off and on, you would have to hit the phone for it to come back on. When speaking on the phone you sounded like you were speaking in a tunnel. I would not recommend buying this phone - I returned it."
1,AT&T used to make good phones,"I bought this phone along with a cordless AT&T phone, and they both quit working within 4 months. I will never order any phones ONLINE again. Will buy them from a nearby source, where I can easily take them back for a refund. Will not buy from AT&T until they improve, if ever."
2,"Good phone, no frills","It works fine and is a good price for someone wanting a phone with no frills. Not a 5 star product, but serviceable.Let me recomend a 5 star product that is also a good price:Lindsey's Backyard Adventure"
1,Very bad service,"I ordered a white phone and you sent me a hunter green phone. Then I had to pay to send it back and that took time away from things I wanted to do. The reason for shoping on line was for convenients. So my first try was bad, and I might not do it again. Jim Dellinger"
1,I wouldn't want my brand on this phone.,"I bought two of them (about a month ago now).First one wouldn't pull a dial tone.Second one wouldn't dial an ""8"" and the microphone quality was so poor that no one could understand what I was saying.Nice quality control, AT&T.;In my opinion, based on actual experience with two of these phones, these things wouldn't be worth the time to order if they were free with free shipping.If you work in theater and need a cheap phone for one of your actors to throw in a heated scene, I highly recommend this phone. It would be perfect for that."
2,Phone ok for the price,"I bought this phone as a back up for when the power goes and and cordless phones don't work. I looked at Wal-Mart and this phone was over half the price of one a similar style. The big drawback to this phone is you cannot shut off the ringer! I don't need another phone ringing when I get a call, so now it simply sits with the phone line unplugged and wedged underneath it waiting. Had I known I could not turn off the ringer, I would not have bought this phone."
5,Great old-style phone,"This phone is simple, has no AC power requirements (which means when you lose power it will still work) and gets the job done. My only complaint: the cord it comes with is too short. If you get this phone, make sure to have a 3-foot replacement cord ready, and you'll be all set!"
5,calling home... good phone!,"What you have here is a quality, reliable phone. While it's not like the updated models you see today, it serves its purpose, and serves its purpose quite well. When it comes down to it, no matter what kind of fancy phone you see in the world today, you're still basically typing numbers in *just* to talk to someone. This is why ANY phone will do. The size, comfort and everything else doesn't matter when it comes down to it. Don't even get me started on ""ring tones"". Geez.As long as the numbers work and the signal is clear, who cares? The AT&T; phone is exactly what you should buy. It's a good old phone."
1,Not a wall phone,"When I searched ""corded wall phone"" this came up and I ordered it. However, it is NOT a wall phone. I installed it on my wall plate just fine, but the receiver falls off the base. The base is straight up and down, so there's nothing to keep the receiver in place. i attempted to call AT & T's customer service to see if there is some trick to installing the phone, but when I entered the model number. the recording said the phone is out of warranty so I was unable to access the help desk.I just ordered a newer version GE trim line phone with caller ID window from 101phones.com. It is described as wall mountable. They have quite a few wall phones to choose from."
2,AT&T 210,"This product is a real lightweight. It does seem to work, but that is about it.I would not recomend this product."
4,Good Old fashion Trim-line Phone,Basic trim-line phone. Was a replacement for a battery operated cordless phone that became too unpredicable.
4,durability versus price at Amazon,I like the number memory of these phones and the fact is the plate is attached to my kitchen wall. The receiver breaks about twice a year and won't automatically dial. I buy four new phones at a time for replacement. They are very inexpensive at Amazon and are always delivered quickly. I can always just plug in a new receiver and don't have to repair the wall.
3,A little bit too big and too heavy,It does the job. But this phone is too big and too heavy. When I travel around and the phone gives me a hard time.
1,Vertical mount,Susposed to be capable of wall installation. Isn't. Handset will fall off if phone is more than one inch from upright.
2,OK for desk top phone - won't work as wall phone,Just wanted a simple corded phone to use on the wall in the basement. Receiver will not stay in place when using as a wall phone so it is useless as a wall phone. For the low price it is not worth the shipping costs to return. No issues with Amazon but it should not be advertised as a wall phone.
3,"slimline phone is a cord phone, good for a back up in case of cell phone failure, loss, or damage","This phone is the original simple cord phone, as it was from years ago and it works fine, except that most of the functioning parts are in the handset and the base is weightless so every time i pick it up, the base falls off the table, dangling by the long cord.I need to mount it to the wall."
2,Problems with the Phone,"I selected this phone because I wanted one that allows the ringer to be turned off and because of the reasonable price. I mounted the phone on the wall. The phone does not want to stay in the cradle on the wall. It falls off a lot. Also, sometimes when it does stay in the cradle, it does not fit in well enough to keep the button pushed down that disconnects the call. So, I hang up the phone and go on my way. Then after a minute or two I hear the ""IF you would like to make a call..."" message and discover that the call did disconnect properly. I can hear the dial tone while the phone is in the cradle."
2,AT&T phone,We bought this phone because it was the only phone we could find that was a corded phone. The phone won't hang up and keeps our phone line busy all the time. I would not buy this phone again.
1,Poor sound quality,"I bought this phone to use in a power outage when my cordless phones do not work. It DOES work, but from both sides of the conversation I sound like I'm in a barrel. Unfortunately threw out the packing material so can't return it. I'll keep it just for emergencies, along with my battery powered lanterns :-)The shipper was great . . . received the phone on time and when expected."
1,poor sound quality,"This phone has terrible sound, it echos and the party you call can hardly hear you. It needs to be returned. very poor quality."
1,Junk,Don't buy this phone. Not all the keys light and when one talks there is an echo in the earpiece that is almost painful. Probably the phone is defective. Back it goes.
1,piece of junk,"i read the other reviews and took a chance. it quit working after a week. the lighted dial was a joke. i went back to using the, quite possibly, 40 year old wall phone that i found at the thrift store. how is it possible that att can manufacture and sell such a piece of junk? it's not like they never built a phone before!"
1,Keypad on Phone doesn't work.,"This phone doesn't work. When I need to dial an extension or account number, the recording I dialed just keeps on talking and keypad doesn't work. It is a cheap phone and I regret I bought it. I don't want to pay the postage or go to the post office just to get another piece of junk. I wish the company would replace it on their own by mail, no charge."
2,buzz,"I like everything about this phone. It is light weight and the buttons are lit and it is simple to operate, but, there is a very noticeable and annoying buzz in the speaker. If it was not for the fact that I will be using it out in the shop where I do not make a lot of calls, I would be sending it right back for a refund. The electronic static should not be present. I tried it in several jacks and the buzz is in the phone, not over the line. I am dissapointed. I know that I did not spend a lot of money, but I do expect AT&T to make a better product or at least have much better quality control at the facility where it was made."
2,AT&T phone too light,Too light as usual. It falls off the table unless I purchase a longer cord.I would rather pay more and get a heavier phone for my nightstand.
1,DOA. Does not ring. Returned it.,"Great classic design. I imagine it is a wonderful phone if you get one that works. Mine refused to ring, and yes I checked the ring setting. Returned it."
1,Good for ....Landfill,"This phone is pure garbage. Not at all like the AT&T; Phones thatused to be. I have ordered this twice now and both of them were junk.Cannot hear clearly on one and people could not hear me on the other. ""You sound like your in a tunnel and it's all crackly"".Don't bother with this product. You will not be happy."
1,WORTHLESS BELL PHONES,"Over 1/2 phones did not work. Bell phones that do not work?? We are being fed so much crap here in America. Products that do work or don't last, and now you cannot trust a Bell Telephone. No way to contact seller. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. AMAZON IS SELLING SO MUCH CRAP NOW TOO, EVEN BELL PHONES DO NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Dinosaur,"I bought this phone, because in the past, I have found AT&T phones to be reliable and good quality and corded phones have had better voice quality. But this phone is clunky and feels cheap. One of the features I needed was the lighted numbers, because I get phone calls for substitute teaching where I have to input a lot of numbers. But the lighting feature is so poor, I have to turn on the room light, anyway, which defeats the purpose of having lighted numbers for me. The ringer is obnoxious and seems to echo. And I don't like the voice quality. I would return the phone, but it isn't worth it. I will keep it, in case any of my other phones fail, but it certainly isn't a joy to use."
2,Poor Call Quality,"This phone is identical to a similar model by Trisonic. I thought it might be better because it was AT&T. Well I found out different. I wanted it because of the illuminated keypad. That works OK but when I am on a call, the other party cannot hear me very well unless the handset is almost in my mouth."
2,Disappointed,"I bought 2 of these phones to replace my older AT&T phones I am currently using. I chose this phone because in the past I have had good luck with AT&T phones. Both of these phones had the same problems. The sender's voice was muffled and not clear at all. There was a rushing and clicking noise in both phones. At first I thought it may have been my phone line, for how could both phones have the same exact problems? My neighbor and I tried the phones at her house with the same results. This model of phone has problems. On the plus side, I can say nothing but good things about Amazon and its return policy. I printed out the return form, mailed it back UPS and two days later my credit card was credited with my refund. I won't buy AT&T again, but I sure am going to continue to buy from Amazon."
5,Best Deal On A Wall Mount Backup Phone,"I purchased this phone because it was the least expensive wall mountable phone that could be used as a backup (not wireless, directly wired) when the power failed. It mounted easily, has several handy features, and appears to work just fine --- objective achieved!"
4,Perfect Simple Phone,My ancient 900MHz cordless phone that I rarely used was dying a slow death of static until the callers could not even hear me. So I wanted something simple that would be good to have in a power outage. This met my needs as I rarely use the landline. This phone reminds me of the old phones we had when I was a child growing up. Large handset making it easy to rest on shoulder and just enough voice feedback so you don't end up yelling into the phone. Nothing to complain about here if all you need is a simple or backup phone.
1,ringer stops ringing,"had this cheapo for a couple months. ringer stopped working. also, it looks like an old school phone from back in the day but it is very light and cheap feeling. not at all solid like the phones of the 80s. craptastic, stay away."
4,Turn Back the Clock,"This phone is what you would expect. I can't believe we used to have phones without a display, therefore I am never certain if I entered in the right number. The instructions in the owners pamphlet are good, only while following the directions, the phone doesn't really let you know if you did everything accurately. For example, to change the ring tones, I had to have someone call me in order to test the ring tones. *ugh* But hey, for $10.00, it does the trick and the connection is great."
2,Nice but,It didn't fit in the application I needed it for. It was hard to tell from the picture and the description.
1,Not too happy.,"I bought this phone for my mother and had it shipped directly to her so I never got to try it out myself. Turns out this phone will only ring ONCE if there are more than 2 phones on the line. This is a 3rd phone that she keeps in the living room. The other two are in the basement and bedroom, which are very nessesary in her home. I have never heard of such a situation before! I'll continue looking for a phone that will ring more than once, thank you very much. Ugh!"
4,Trimline phone,Simple to install old type phone. Didn't need an outlet to power the unit. Just needed a simple corded phone. Glad I found it.
1,wall phone won't stay on the wall,"I bought this phone to use as a wall phone. Like many people who bought this phone said the receiver falls off. It is unusable. Who knows what the sound is like I couldn't get it to stay on the wall. The phone is very light weight (cheap), not at all like the old AT&t phone of the past. I would not recommend this phone except throw it in the trash."
1,Defective!!,"I have used and loved the Trimline phone for over 20 years. I ordered two, and both were defective. It sounded like I was underwater, and people had trouble hearing me. I drove the next day to Radio Shack and bought them locally, and they were perfect."
1,Terrible phone,"Bought 2 of these phones, neither of them worked. They distorted my voice so that the person I was trying to talk to couldn't understand me."
1,POS,"All I ask a phone to do is allow me to make and receive calls. I also expect that when I make a call, the person on the receiving end can hear me. Not with this phone. I made several calls to different people, including my voice mail at work. Not one person could understand what I was saying. I checked my voice mail and they were right. The call sounded like I was talkin into a pillow. What the hell happened to ATT quality. I have another ATT phone manufactured in 1986 and it still works as well as the day I bought it. Don't waste your money on this POS."
1,Feedback,This phone has feedback at the lowest volume setting so much that it is to annoying to use. recomend do not buy!
4,Good emergency second phone,"I purchased this phone as an emergency phone for use when the electricity fails, but I like the three quick dial buttons at the top. Because it is large, it is easy to read but I need two hand to operate it. I recommend it as as good second phone. ACB"
5,Solid!,"When the box arrived we were a bit worried the product was damaged. After opening we found it to be well packaged and without a scratch. This item requires assembly with a hammer and screwdriver. Parts are well packaged and sorted. There are no written instructions, you will be following illustrations only for assembly. Took less than and hour.We are really impressed with the quality of this item. It looks like an expensive piece of furniture."
4,Nice for the money.,Nice color and finish.Goes together pretty easy with out much trouble. Solid and stable. Scratches pretty easy though.For the money Im pleased.
2,"Overpaid, will not recommend","i bought this thinking this was made of wood, atleast that's what the product description said. it's MDF with a very thin veneer, gets easily damaged. the only part I liked was easy assembly..overall very disappounted with the product and I overpaid..not recommended"
4,Beautiful Cabinet,"This is a beautiful, sturdy cabinet. However there are a few things that need to be addressed. One cabinet door is tweeked...maybe just needs an adjustment....and then there are a few small knicks on the edges...other than that it is a peice that looks much more costly that what was paid. Overall I am very pleased."
2,Not too happy,"When I recieved the product, the box looked as if it was used as a beer pong table for generations upon generations of frat life. Once I opened the box, I found most of the pieces were either scratched, or the corners of the top portion of the stand were bent upwards. Most of the small bags containing the screws and such were torn open, leading me on at least a half hours worth of digging around to find loose screws and fasteners through all the packing material. Other than that, it's a very sturdy and nice looking stand for my flat screen TV. A 47"" LCD fits perfectly on top. I don't know if it's how the company stores the furniture, or how they ship it, but it was completely ridiculous the condition I recieved the product in."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I'm not crazy about building my own furniture, but since assembled units similar to this in furniture stores were running twice the price I figured I'd give it a try. The unit is MDF covered in a very dark walnut veneer. Quality of the pieces are good, but not as good as you would find in a furniture store. I allocated 2 hours for assembly but ended up needing 3. Getting the doors on and allighned was the hardest part. Don't bother using all 27(!) screws to attach the cardboard back pannel. I got a secure fit with 9."
2,"Ya it looks good, but will it protect?","I was looking for a sleeve-like option for MBP, but didn't find a lot of options in the 17"" category. So far the Booq Vyper XL2 is pretty good. It offers a rigid outside that looks thicker than it really is. There is also not much extra padding along the corners; where you need the most protection. The zippers are also on the weak-side, although I have had no trouble with them so far. All-in-all, I don't think I would have purchased this sleeve if I saw it in the store. Might rather have gone with Timbuk2 padded Sleeve for its added protection."
2,Delivered with broken leg,"This item was meant to be given as a gift but when i opened the package I found a few VERY disappointing things! Every single item ( even the little ones in bags) was COVERED in an inch of dust or sawdust. I had to throughly clean every item. Also one entire leg was riddled with holes and was breaking as i touched it. I'd like it to be replaced as soon as possible so please contact me.Other then that its very cute, a little cheap but I only paid 55 for it so thats to be expected."
5,Great simple gifts,"I bought one for my mother as a gift, and she loved it so much my sister wanted one too. They're easy to put together and look great in the corner of the dining room. Take up less space than expected, too. They look like they cost more than they did- great purchase."
5,A nature extension of Mr Bean live series,"The whole series certainly did not disappoint. The kids and I love every episodes and wish there were more. However, I'm sure we will revisit the whole series again and again.The only thing that was annoying was the inability to select all episodes to play in one hit. Instead, we have to play 2 titles at a time from each DVD which is somewhat of an inconvenient.Nonetheless, we will definitely buy more if more are available!"
4,Pearl Jam - Live At Easy Street,"When i looked at the set lists for this i was a little disappointed. But after listening to it i was pleasantly surpised. The sound quality on this EP is much better than most bootlegs i've heard. It features 3 cover songs never released before and 4 other pearl jam songs. Highly recommended if you are a big pj fan like me.Hightlights include: bleed for me (originally by the Dead Kennedys), and Porch (a superb version of this)"
2,rare disappointment,"this live show was a rare disappointment and this is coming from a fan that has a hard time finding fault with anything they do musically! ooops! sorry i thought i was doing live at the show box, it was not good, ed was not happy to be there and was rather rude to those in attendance! this opinion comes from a life long PJ fan that has spent countless thousands of dollars on their music and merch, its just a little disappointed when he disrespects his fans and being from NC i'm sure i""ll get my share of hate but i still love their music and all their humanitarian efforts,(not so much the politics that they have forgone the music for) but they are the greatest band in the world and i'll always love them and their non political music!jeff"
5,For that large room.......,"These are wonderful speakers with great dynamics of sound via the woofer mid and high speakers. If you have the right stereo equipment and area for the sound to let yourself be enveloped, then these are the right speakers. Actually they are very large given the 15"" bass woofers. The cabinets are sturdy and they do not rumble or vibrate when playing, like some inferior brands may do. I have a large and powerful vintage Pioneer receiver/amp that puts out the descrete sound at all variables. I have high vaulted ceilings and the sound is very good even at a somewhat loud level, given the trim. Exceptional at best, to last a long time."
5,Awesome Speakers!,"These speakers are so powerful that I have a tough time keeping my pictures staight on my living room walls! With thunderous lows and crisp highs these are the best speakers I ever had. Please note that with your average surround sound amplifier, you will not realize the full potential of these units. I knew this in advance and purchased a Cerwin Vega CV-1800 Professional Series amplifier along with the speakers. At 400 watts per channel @8 ohms, it turns them into true ""pant leg shakers""!!! Very Happy!"
4,Amazing!!!,"It's amazing that a soundtrack this rich and diverse came from such a terrible movie. The world may have already forgotten that turkey (based on a beautiful novel by Oscar Hijuelos) but this energetic collection of of sizzling mambo standards will enrich anyone's music collection.The liner notes read like a Who's Who of Latino music. Everyone from the legendary Celia Cruz and Tito Puente to Los Lobos and Linda Ronstadt make contributions to the CD and pay homage to the great tradition of musical expression in Latino culture.Even Antonio Banderas get's into the act, singing the film version of ""Bella Maria de mi Alma"" with enough passion to make you wonder if he's made the right career choice. The three tracks by Celia Cruz are reason enough to purchase this disk, everything else is just gravy!"
4,"Great for whittling and carving. Pretty good for other hobbies, too!","This finger guard does a good job of protecting your finger from accidental slices while woodcarving or whittling. Please note that this guard is best suited to protect against glancing slices, so it is no substitute for proper safety techniques.If you purchase this finger guard and later decide that whittling isn't the hobby for you, don't fret. Slap a couple googly eyes on this bad boy, and you'll be all set to take up ventriloquism with your brand new super-stylish finger puppet."
4,Leather finger guard,This little guard fits well and has come in handy when working on carving projects and other uses I have wanted to protect myself.
4,Guard is ok,My husband is a novice carver so I thought this would be helpful for him. He doesn't like wearing it but the item itself is well made.
5,great finger guard for my grandson,I am giving these to my grandson for Christmas. Hopefully they will keep his fingers safe from from carving tools.
5,Good for a little extra protection,"It's not completely cut proof, of course, but it does an awesome job giving just enough extra protection to protect from those routine nicks and cuts that come from whittling and detail carving without adding too much extra padding.It was a little odd feeling to me at first, but after working with it for just 20 or minutes or so, I got use to it and it felt more comfortable to me than wearing a full glove on my hand that hold's the knife.I would recommend them."
4,New Gloves,"So I have some really nice airsoft gloves that wore apart from winding clips. These saved my gloves, and I am very happy with the product, albeit cumbersome at first."
5,Necessary protection.,These things have proved their value and protection several times over since I bought them. Wouldn't work around craft knives without them. Almost overnight shipping too!
5,Exactly as described,This product was exactly as described and arrived with in 3 days of placing my order.I was very happy with it. Will order again if my son keeps this hobby.
3,guards,these guards have a tendency to move around on my fingers. this could be due to the way that i carve
3,Eh...,"I would have been better off starting off just wearing a full leather glove. I got a little careless while carving and cut across the top of my finger and had to stop carving for a couple days. I really don't use this anymore. Luckily, it was cheap. In its defense, it protected the part of my finger that it was supposed to protect ;)"
4,An Undiscovered Gem!,"Pick Dickow is a singular artist making singular music. The follow up to 2005's Drumsolo's Delight, Future Rock has a leaner palette of textures and a more aggressive selection of beats. As always Dickow allows his songs to develop naturally without ever feeling overlong, incorporating an incredibly subtle composition/production ethic. Although recently named on The Wire's best of 2007 list Future Rock was largely unexplored in 2007 and that is truly a shame."
2,dosent last long,good system but lasted about 2 years. it was left in the same spot and suddely the cd door became jammed and it slowly fell apart after that.
3,"Nice book, wonderful pictures, But not the best of Mexican Interiors","This is definately a well layed out book, with really nice high quality pictures, my only question is why are at least half of the picture in this book of houses in the United States? Granted they are in the Southwest where there is a obvious Mexican influence, but I refuse to believe the best examples of Mexican interiors are found in Tucson Arizona! And of the interiors in this book most of the ones from Mexico are from San Miguel de Allende, or Guanajuato which are two towns a hour apart from each other. There are extraordinary colonial gems in Zacatecas, Oaxaca, Puebla, México City, ect, ect, that could have easily been included in this book instead of some American's house in the Southwest... I would have liked to have seen a book on Mexican interiors that were 100% Mexican. The book MEXICOLOR, though not entirely consisting of interiors is a far more authentic book."
5,Great idea book,"We were looking for ideas for our outside patio area, especially colors, and this book is great for various decors with vibrant colors. You will find yourself looking through it again and again."
1,Marketing Tool - Caveat Emptor!,"This is simply a marketing tool for the MLM ""Young Living Essential Oils"" and most of the positive reviews here from probably written by shills of the company. If you buy this book, simply be aware that it is intended to steer you to their products and no give a truly unbiased view of this science. Contrary to loyal customers of this company, there are other places to get quality essential oils - don't be fooled by their rhetoric.The publisher, ""Essential Science Publishing,"" is simply a front for the Young Living Essential Oils company, allowing them to publish things that wouldn't fly as marketing for the product - i.e. lies and hard-to-prove ideas."
4,essential oil desk reference,This book is very useful. It explains the history and use of essential oils very well. The only thing I did not like is that it is based mostly on the use of Young Living's products. I am not sure if its suggestions are for Young Living's products or most quality oils.
4,Great reference,Mainly only for use with the Young Living Essential Oils. I use this desk reference every day for myself and my 5 children and works very well.
5,Essential Oils Desk Reference,"Essential Oils Desk Reference is a must for understanding essential oils, how they work and directions for their use. I recommend it highly for anyone interested in essential oils and their use."
3,Essential Oils Desk Reference,"This is a helpful book, however the oils it refers to almost exclusively are Young Living Essential Oils, oil blends and digestive products. So, it seems it would be appropriate to indicate somewhere on the cover this information. If a person is using another product line, there is no product tranlation available. The book is not cheap, so an individual can feel mislead in buying it to find that it only refers to one product line, offered by a multi-level marketing company. For that reason, I have given it a rating of 3."
5,Highly recommended,This is a very good manual for anyone interested in broadening their knowledge of essential oils and how to use them for a variety of conditions.It was recommended by my teacher and it has been a very important title in my personal library since.
5,Essential Oils Desk Reference,I bought this book in hopes of getting information on the actual application uses of oils. It is an excellent source.
3,Packaging,"The book came in record time but was only wrapped in brown paper, and the post office torn the paper and torn the corner of the book. I am a little disappointed and would have appreciated the book in a bubble wrap envelope or box, for the price paid for the book."
5,"Such a Cute, Entertaining Movie","I purchased this for a toddler, but it is a movie for the whole family, no matter what age. It even teaches the mice about the First Christmas and the Holy Family. Make it a part of your holiday collection."
1,Sucks beyond belief!,"Having just discovered the techno genre around 96', I had high hopes for this disc titled ""The Hardtrance Experience."" But somehow I dont actually remember gettin my freak on while listening to Native American chants ( you know that ayyyyyyy yaaaaaa yaaaahhhhyaaaaaaaaaa yaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaahhhh ooooooohhhhh oooooooooh ) followed by an hours worth of angels playing friggin harps. Boooooooo! This is the worst techno/trance/anything CD I've ever heard, and that includes Milla Jojovich's ""Divine Comedy"" which until today was the worst piece of trash I'd ever come in contact with. Come to think of it, Milla's ridiculous Slavic Folk dirge makes for a better trance record than this thing does. 1 cardiac needle"
4,great movie,Zero Day is by far the best movie about the Columbine Massacre I've ever seen. It feels more authentic since the whole movie is film by handheld cameras. It really makes you feel like you were there with them and you know all of their secrets. Its a must see if you're interested in that type of thing.
3,Zero Day DVD,"Excellent video a training to prevent or make others aware of thisAs a form of entertainment, it is not designed for that, as it was set up in a diary format reliving the days prior to the shooting through the eyes of Harris and Klebold.The movie is based of the actions of Harris and Klebold who were the gunmen in the Columbine Highschool shooting. The movie is an actual based presentation of the videos that were made by the suspects prior to that day. It does explain the amount of thought and action they put into this tragic event. They did there research! Makes you wonder how far they could have gone, and how much they could have accomplished had they put this effort towards something else.This video deffinately teaches you allot.It also let people know that it does not mean that the families of the suspects caused it or that it was a random event."
2,Don't eat the fish,"I thought this film was a talky, irritating mess, and felt I'd get more insight suffering through actual security cam and home videos of the Columbine kids. What I appreciated about the similiar themed ""Elephant"" was the amount of information revealed about the characters through visuals alone. ""Zero Day"" may offer more gritty, awkward teenage realism, but ""Elephant"" was able to somewhat relay the disturbed driving spirit behind the acts of violence, something even a flawed film like ""Life Before Her Eyes"" managed to do."
3,Not Great,"I was very disapointed. Not the greatest film, no new or intersting information. Should have rented it."
5,"The Best Set and Mid-Price, to Boot","Bach's lute suites are pieces to whose performance virtuallyevery classical guitarist aspires. They are truly monuments ofmusic for lute or guitar, challenging every player to revealtheir greatness in melody, counterpoint, and harmony.John Williams meets the challenge on this recording better thanany other guitarist whom I have heard. The performances fairlysing, while at the same time keeping all the voices clear.This is one of the finest performances of any music that I haveever heard, and, at mid-price, it's a steal."
1,BUYER BEWRE,THIS DISC IS BOOTLEG THE MOVIE IS SHOT IN CAMCORDER. IS BORING TO THE XTREME. If you wanna see jill kely naked go buy a real porn. This is not even R rated in my book.
3,"How do I get this iron HOT? It spits water when I turn to where I think it should be,HELP","How do you get this iron to a HOT setting? When I turn what I think it is, the iron spits out water and gunk?? Please advise, otherwise I would like this iron if it would work. No booklet came in my box I would appreciate any HELP in this matter."
4,Good practice,"This story was good for learning new Spanish vocab and reviewing old during my second semester of (beginning) college Spanish. It also covers all the verb tenses learned during this period. The story was not exciting, but not bad."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"This must be a joke, seriously! I am seventeen years old, have been singing classically for 12 years, and i could do way better than this! If this is all the talent you need to record a CD, i'm in! This cd is good for boosting your confidence, because it reminds you that there is always someone else in the world who's much worse off than you. How old is rosemary exactly? everyone says she's young, but is she as young as i am?"
1,Hahahahahaha.....,"Surely you jest, the 4 or 5 of you who have written great reviews for this girl. I have been studying classical voice for 5 weeks and could blow this girl away on Lasciatemi Morire. Her interpretation is awful and isn't even true to the score. There are missed notes and timings everywhere. What a disgrace to a lovely song."
1,Is this a joke?,"I ordered this CD under the impression that a talented, developed vocalist would be performing the selections. However I was seriously mistaken. I was extremely disappointed in this CD. I found her singing to be breathy, out of tune and not well trained. I am a music student, and I have heard scores of people produce a much lovlier sound in practice rooms... so why does this young lady get her own CD? This is not to say that one day she may develop her voice, expand her range and acquire better habits...but at this point I see no good reason for her to have her own recording that is available to the public. I am very sorry that I wasted my money on this purchase. I should have stuck with Cecilia and Kathleen."
1,I could not agree more,"It's been seven years since this ordeal. I'm really sorry that all of you bought this recording without realizing what you were getting. Please know that it was not my idea. I was a 17 year-old kid with little training and very poor guidance. Honestly, when I realized how I'd been taken and manipulated, I required counseling and it took years to get over it. I would give anything to go back in time and undo this...but unfortunately I cannot and it is the ghastly skeleton in my closet. Please know that I am light years beyond this now because I actually went to school and got a formal education in vocal performance."
1,"Wow, i've never heard the likes....","This album is pure entertainment. I too am a pre-professional opera singer at a major conservatory and it was an accident that I rean across this recording, on Rhapsody musis service no less. I really hate to laugh at bad singing because I know how hard it is to get up in front of people. But, when you make a recording and put it out there...beware. Your public will respond and this one is a dud. Sorry!"
1,How sad,"What a shame... I cannot find a single thing of musical value on this album. I'd use the CD for target practice, but it already has a whole in the middle, so it is not even useful for that. Whatever person submitted the first several reviews on this site is either disingenuous or deaf...."
1,hideous singing = wonderful entertainment,"I am an opera major at a conservatory of music. Recently, my voice teacher and I got into a conversation about the entertainment value of BAD singing. ""To be be guite honest"", she said, ""there is nothing worse than plain GOOD singing....it's just boring. Either give me really GREAT singing that moves you to tears or really BAD singing that makes you struggle to hold back your laughter, or (god forbid) laugh out loud. Even better yet, is bad singing when the singer is really into it!"" Rosemary personifies bad singing! As if her horrendous italian, innacuracy of pitch, and unsupported breathyness weren't humerous enough, the gusto with which she delivers these songs makes her CD a pure delight! Each time i listen, i find myself rolling on the floor with tears of laughter streaming down my face! Give me Anna Moffo, Franco Corelli, and Rene Pape, or give me Rosemary!!"
1,I'd give it a Zero if I could!,"Shamefully bad -- this HAS to be a joke! Way off-pitch, artificial vibrato, breathy... remarkably horrible! Even people who ""pretend"" to sing opera sing better than this. Incredibly painful to listen to. Please, for pete's sake, spend your money elsewhere. I've been to grade school plays that had better singers than this."
5,Opah!,I was thrilled to give this as a baptism present for the daughter of a first generation Greek-American woman. People of Greek ancestry are especially proud of their heritage and this gift was enthusiastically received. A home run!!! -- To mix cultures :-)
3,"Cable fine, but no snagless connectors","I spent about five times as much as the bargain-basement cables because I need to run a long network cable along the baseboards of my apartment, and I don't want to do all that work only to find that my connection goes down because I used a cheap cable. (Some of the other cable reviews talked about non-solid, non-twisted, non-copper wiring, etc.) The cable itself seems fine, but I was dismayed to find that the cable I received does not include snag-free connectors. That part costs a few cents at the most, yet can extend the life of the cable by a huge amount. Very disappointed by that omission. (The featured picture did appear to have snag-free connectors.)"
3,"Flawed, but worthy of a read.","This is an interesting little book. Novoselic argues, and rightfully so, that change must come from WITHIN the system, not by violent revolution. He names a number of ways by which to do this, including speaking out at community meetings, running for local office, etc. These are good thoughts, but they are well-trodden, and have been heard a number of times before. I don't think Novocelic is trying to speak to the ""youth"" of America here - I'm sure few people under 25 even know who he is (He's the guy in Nirvana who looks like Andy Kaufman) - but to people like me, who have aged somewhat, still cling to the ideals of their youth, and want to make a difference but aren't sure how. This is a flawed book, to be sure, but for someone who normally wouldn't pick up a political book, it could be seen as a call to make a difference. It's a short read (an hour or two), and I'd say worth it, but don't stop with this, it's merely an introduction to social change."
2,Grunge or Government?,Was hoping for more grunge and leas government :( I'd say it's about 25% grunge 75% government and I respect Krists views on USA democracy but I was hoping for more insight into his experience with Nirvana
4,Great Government Reform Book,"This book is a great view into the electoral system. Krist provides many alternates to our current primary system, that has sparked my curiousity beyond the book and into other literature. If you are looking for a Nirvana book, then your not going to find much past the the begining of the book. It is a also kind of short for my taste and not bound to well. All in all, if your looking at this book anyway, you prob are going to buy it no matter what I say, so enjoy!"
3,not as bad as I expected,"I received this book as a gift, and I expected it to be a mess of poorly written ignorant rantings. And to be sure, the book is written badly enough to be a source of amusement, with knee-slappingly silly sentences such as ""Kurt [Cobain's] death was a giant media affair. Someone remarked that it was like the Kennedy assassination...""But once Novoselic goes beyond his autobiography he has a mildly interesting story to tell: after becoming a successful musician, he learned that the music business, just like Philip Morris or Exxon, has interests that can be affected by politics, and he learned how to lobby politicians and otherwise become part of the democratic process.The last half of the book discusses various flaws in the democratic process (in particular the ""wasted votes"" that result when voters are packed into districts or states that are ""safe"" for one party or the other) and gives an OK introduction to issues that professors and pundits have discussed more articulately."
2,What's YOUR favourite political statement from Krist?,"My favourite political statement Krist Novoselic made was when he wiped his bum crack with the American flag after playing a Twister game while covered head-to-toe in Crisco shortening (no joke, read CAYA) in 1992 after Nirvana broke big. That says everything about Krist's view of politics; he just doesn't care. Although, his book says the same thing."
3,stylistically wrong,"Having studied with an international authority on cornet playing I can con fidently say that Wynton's cornet playing is ok at best. More than anything hes tryying to sell CDs rather than capture the essence of Cornet playing, like most of wyntons playing its alot of flash but no substance. Great if your a trumpet head and you get off on empty virtuostic fluff."
2,A disappointment,This reproduction of the original tapes is of poor quality. It is no better than the worn-out tape I threw away. It has the same annoying screechy tone on the high notes.
1,Shame on the author and publisher!,I'm writing you because of the FALSE reviews and recommendations on amazon. Shame on those who pollute the review pool with self serving recommendations.
5,This is the heart of leadership.,"Beginning with a foreword by bestselling leadership guru Kenneth Blanchard, this book never lets up until the back cover. It actually moved me to tears in several places, especially during the accounts of the heroes of September 11, 2001 and World War II icon Raoul Wallenberg. Truly inspiring. And the idea-laden chapters on time management and mentoring should be declared national treasures. I found the discussion questions at the end of every chapter to be very valuable, too, because they forced me to think about what I was reading and apply the lessons to new situations. The book changed me, for the better."
5,fade to red,"excellent book, kept me interested and guessing. I love all her novels -- this one didn't disappoint either! Looking forward to some more of her novels."
4,Great book but too graphic for me,"I thought this book was very well written...in fact, a little too well written for me. Some of the scenes described were very graphic, and they just weren't images I want in my mind. For someone who loves a good mystery and great detail on murder scenes, definitely read this book. I gave it 4 stars, because it's well written, but I won't be purchasing any more of this author's books. It's just not my style."
2,disappointing,"While it's true that I like to be surprised by the ending of a mystery novel, this ending was so out of left field as to be unbelievable."
1,Worse than a bad self-published book,"I just did something I never do. I returned this book to Amazon. I gave up on it only about 15% of the way in, but by then, I had been so distracted by the numerous typos, formatting errors, conversational paragraphs with no new breaks in them, and more that I had to give up. I can't believe a publisher or an author would let something as error-laden as this go to market. The numerous typos pulled me out of the story--and it was so bad I felt I had no other choice than to return it and insist on a refund, even though I only paid $3 for it. It's a shame too, because I was really excited about this author and had every intention of reading all of her books. I started with this one because it was a good deal and because it was set where I live, in Seattle. But after this experience, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for me to pick up a Linda Castillo book again."
5,CL's Magnum,"Charles Lloyd is in top form here - a daunting performance - reminiscent of the ballad era Trane, yes . . . and a bit further on in time. I agree with the reviewer in his comparison with the other later recordings - this is the one Charles Lloyd recording to have - a masterpiece by any standards. Canto, Big Sur Tapestry (a rare recording he did with the great harpist Georgia Kelly in the late 1970's), and Forest Flower, imo, are the best Charles Lloyd recordings - I also like Wave, his electrofunk effort of the mid-70's."
2,"Good design, poor reliability","I bought 3 of these from Amazon.com, as I like the design and sound quality. Unfortunately the build quality is poor. On one of the units, if I anwer an incoming call, I get a dial tone and the call is cut off. One of the other units, I get intermittant disconnects. One, however, works fine."
3,Too much of other scenes than caillou,"I have only opened and viewed one cd out of the 3 but I can tell you that it has way too much other kinds of entertainment than the caillou cartoon. It has the stuff animals associated with caillou and a lot of other clips of children playing, etc. It might be ok for an older child but my 2 yr old only wants to watch caillou! If I had known there would be so much of other kinds of things mixed in I would have made a different choice."
4,Enjoyed,My nephew loves the dvd! He will play it over and over again! I am so glad that we purchased this for him!
2,caillou holiday favorites,It has a lot of puppet parts that the kids don't like. I had to keep fast forwarding it to get to the caillou show.
3,All Dressed Up And Blue,"I consider myself a Bruce Springsteen fan, but I've never been one to put him on a pedestal and worship him like some sort of deity. Having said that, although ""Tunnel Of Love"" is one of my least favorite Springsteen albums, it contains what may be my favorite Springsteen moment ever laid down on wax (or whatever it is CD's are made of): the twangy Duane Eddy-esque guitar solo which appears approximately 1:45 into ""Tougher Than The Rest."" The rest of the material is just too, dare I say, mature, too slick and professional, almost as if it appears Springsteen has resigned himself to his lot in life. There's none of the grit or jubilation evident on ""Born In The U.S.A."" or, for that matter, ""Nebraska."" Leaves me kind of cold..."
2,Darren d.,Tunnel of love was not for me mybe two song that i like. TOUGHT THEN THE REST AND SPARE PARTS.it mybe a hard time in his life at that time but don`t make it hard on us. IT`S A ok cd if you like sad sad song`s solo or not tunnel of love is not the boss. thank you.
4,Tunnel of Love,"The reason I bought this CD was ""Tunnel of Love"". It's a beautiful song. It reminds one of why they are involved with the person in the first place. There are other good songs but ""Tunnel of Love"" takes the cake."
5,"when it all falls apart, out go the lights...","While he has had greater releases before and after this album, Tunnel of Love remains one of my favorite Springsteen albums ever. I was just sitting in the library at college doing my work while listening to this album. When It was finished, I was like man, that's a great record. That it is. It contains several ""should have been hits"" in the US such as ""Tougher than the Rest,"" ""Walk Like A Man,"" and ""Two Faces,"" while the hits (Tunnel of Love, Brilliant Disguise, All that Heaven Will Allow) are great. Just wish he would do them live more, but other than that, a great record all around.Also, some dude who gave this album a one star was bashing Bruce, Bob Seger, Sheryl Crow, and The Rolling Stones. GROW UP. I like Green Day also, but that doesn't make me put these other great artists down!"
5,Bruce in love,"The want of love, the loss of love, the power of love, are all topics of this Springsteen ""solo ""album. Going in the opposite direction of BORN IN THE USA, TUNNEL OF LOVE softens the approach, allowing Springsteen the luxury of letting the simple melodies and heartfelt singing to be the focus of the song, rather than just an aspect of the song as was the case on BORN. Love the cause of so much joy and so much pain has always been a great topic for Springsteen's songwriting and while you might think a whole album dedicated to love might be too much, Springsteen pulls it off magnificently. While the E-Street Band makes appearances throughout, this really is Springsteen going it alone. A little more high-tech than NEBRASKA, TUNNEL OF LOVE reaches for the same sense of intimacy and grabs it with intensity."
4,Springsteens Most Underated.....4.5 stars,"I could never understand why this CD has never gotten the commercial acceptance that ""Born In The USA"" got (which I felt was the boss's most overrated). I hate to refer to this as Springsteens ""love song"" album because that brings up an image of Michael Bolton. I guess you could say they are ""relationship songs"" as nearly all of them are about dying relationships(One Step Up), deceit (Brilliant Disguise, Two Faces). Sounds kinda of like a bummer but it's not. These songs the older I get take on more meaning. I can hear ""ONe Step UP"" and it still reminds of a relationship I had that didn't make it. I can also listen to ""Valentines Day"" and remember what it felt like driving 3 1/2 hours though the night to see my girlfriend years ago and the nervousness and excitement I felt, wondering where this long distance relationship was going to go. I put this as one of the boss's 3 best CDs."
1,WTF happened?,"After the brilliant Born in the USA, this is all Bruce could offer. Interesting... anyway, the whole damn thing is smothered in '80's production, which is one count against it. The lyrics, which were supposed to be personal but turned out weak, are another. To make things even worse, Clarence Clemon's doesn't play a NOTE on this recording. The silver lining is Brilliant Disguise, which is indeed brilliant, plus he cooks up a nice extended metaphor on the title track. Even then, the tune itself is thin. This is easily Bruce's weakest - I'd go with Born to Run, Born in the USA, The River, Darkness at the Edge of Town or The Wild etc. instead - hell, even mediocre stuff like the debut and Lucky Town are better."
4,A soft side of Bruce,"This 1987 release of TUNNEL OF LOVE is more adult contemporary than hard rock unlike his predecessors. Only BRILLIANT DISGUISE was recycled for the GREATEST HITS compilation nearly eight years later. The E Street Band is seldom heard on this album. His not-yet second wife Patti Scialfa provides background vocals on many songs. Most of this album was recorded in the studio of Bruce's New Jersey home. At the time of recording,he was married to actress Julianne Phillips. Other hits from this album include the title track and ONE STEP UP. After this album,Bruce would take a five-year studio break to marry Scialfa and start and raise a family with her."
3,Ok book,"I read the book and I didnt get what I expected. Throughout the book the writer promises the solution or tools, but they were never given. Good book for general info but not for its tittle. I would say that this book is for married men. At times is explicit with personal stories, but I still need to find another book to get more info what to do when good men are tempted."
5,Excellent no holds barred book,This book does a great job of first explaining how a man thinks and can get into trouble and then how to stay out of trouble. It does not get into psycobabble excuses for sin. It is well written and easy to understand. Also a very good book for women to read to understand how mens minds work as well as mens relationships. I recommend it for all christian men and make sure you leave it where your wife will pick it up. Also good for fathers to share with thier teenage sons!!!
4,To finally understand the REAL problem and it's solution.,"Bill nailed it perfectly....progressive addiction and the fear and shame of it.<BR> It is the first time that I understand that it is also about seeking intimacy - filling the ""hole"" <BR> After reading this book I more fully understand my addiction and the solution. This book<BR> will open the eyes of all who read it - men AND women.<BR>"
2,Disappointing,"Supposedly, this is a good book for all men. It's really for married Christian men. (Latter stages of the book go into anatomical detail and sexual specifics, and I have to wonder what the author was thinking if his intent was to reach--in a helpful way--single men struggling with temptation issues.)The opening chapter ""Why Naked Women Look So Good"" ranks up there as an all-time low (for a number of reasons) in Christian publishing. Also, the author's ""counsel"" on the issue of masturbation is questionable. He seems like he can't decide.Overall, this book is certainly not the one you want if you're seriously needing help with sexual temptation."
1,Not helpful,"Too titilating, too enabling, too permissive, too ""boys will be boys."" Not helpful. If you want to read a book to convince your wife that you are trying to get free of sexual bondage but you really have no intention of changing, this is the book for you. If you actually want to get free of sexual bondage, look somewhere else. Try Ted Roberts' book, Pure Desire."
5,Excellent!,"I strongly recommend this book for any man that has thought ""I can't help it."" This book met me where I needed it. Bill Perkins is able to tie in our spiritual needs to something that we all need."
5,Break the destructive cycle,"If you have been struggling to overcome a cycle of sexual obsession, then this is the book to get. I was amazed with the truthfullness and the accuracy it presents the stages and thoughts which men go through. Don't rely on yourself to break the cycle. Read this book, and find that you do have someone who can give you the strength and the tools to overcome."
1,Extremely narrow minded and limiting.,"From a non-christian veiwpoint Bill Perkins has written an essay that gives all men permission to view women as sex objects. He blames lust on either mans biological makeup or on the devil. He seems to consider lust as only a male problem. And claims that lust can never be overcome but only controlled, and only with Gods' help. He has packed it full of bible scripture and clearly places men at the top of the human order. Not as an equal too women but as better than. I'd say this is a book that has been written by a man that clearly does not want to accept any personal blame for his lust or ignorance. About the only positive thing I got from this book was his references to what sexual socialization and pornography does to our thoughts and moral character. If you want help or understanding about this problem without using God, Biology, or the Devil as a ScapeGoat for your problems then this is not a book I would suggest."
1,"mysogimist,disgusting,lies","I have past experience in the Christian world,as a presentAthiest I can only say how distasteful this book is and insulting of women.A woman is thought of as the sensual sexy tempteress of men.Nowhere in this true in real life,,only in the lives of Christian men who want to feel superior to women and subjegatethem.The real world are against these narrow minded ""ideals"""
4,Worth the effort it takes to read this book.,A personal look at one of the greatest women of our time. She truly was a trail-blazer for women of all races and stood true to her ethical beliefs to the very end. Rogers also gives us an inside look at politics at it's very worst and very best. The book bogs down in details of political infighting but is worth the effort for the lessons learned.
4,strongest drumming presence of this trio's recordings,"Fans of drumming great Peter Erskine will enjoy this tasteful recording where even when Erskine's presence is strong, the compositional thrust remains on track, and very interactive with the percussives."
2,MSAR. Get it.,"My parents have been buying me this book almost every year since i was in 10th grade (haven't had the heart to tell them I don't need or want it anymore). it does contain some useful information, but as another reviewer said, it's right out of the Medical School Admission Requirements published by the AAMC. I have about 5 editions of ""The Best Medical Schools"", and I can tell you that you would be better off getting the MSAR."
5,Works fine,I've used the cable a few times to make a local network between two laptops and transfer files. It works fine and is a high quality cable. Would highly recommend.
3,Belkin CAT5e crossover wire,"Tried to hook up the two computers with the cable. Seemed to fit OK but the computers never seemed to ""see"" each other."
4,Regular old cross over cable,can't say anything bad about it. Works just as advertised. I like how it is red to differentiate from my other cables.
1,Wrong cable bad service,"Do not buy this from Restockit. They may send you a patch cable instead of crossover. Apparently, these folks do care much about matching their orders. On top of this it takes them forever to issue RMA. I've been waiting for 10 days now."
3,Poorly Marked Cross Over Cable,Cable needs to be marked so it's not confused with regular RJ45M cable. Can't tell the difference between a regular LAN cable and the crossover cable. Other than that it worked as advertised.
2,"Too little information, even for beginners","This is an introductory (undergraduate level) book targeted towards practitioners. The content is far from being satisfactory, even for beginners. However, if you have only a couple of hours and you want to get some information about GAs, this book is for you. If you're looking for comprehensive coverage on the topic, I'd recommend Eiben & Smith's ""Introduction to Evolutionary Computing""."
5,Great luggage for international travel,I purchased this for my recent international travel. I have another similar delsey luggage which we traveled with on previous trips and have performed wonderfully. This luggage is light and is extremely roomy. Everything about the luggage is quality. I would definitely buy another if I need another of this size. I have both Delseys and Samsonites and they both perform just as well. I believe the Delseys are slightly lighter.
1,Bag tips over when full,"This bag is badly constructed. I took it on one trip and one of the zippers broke. Worse yet, the stand at the bottom of the suitcase is not designed well because the bag is constantly tipping over when full (i.e. 50 pounds), it almost crushed my one-year old a couple of times. I have Samsonite bags that never tip over under the same conditions."
3,Confusion About Overweight Indicator,"I love the spaciousness of this suitcase, but I'm having one issue with it. I can't tell if the indicator is red or not. It doesn't seem to be a light. When I lift it in the light it looks kind of red, but I can't tell if I'm just catching and reflecting the light. In the dark, it doesn't look red... has anyone else had issues with this?"
5,Easy to read and great action sequence pictures,"Normally, karateka need to practice kata and get feedback from sensei, sempai and peers. Show self-motivation to buy the book and learn as much as you can from this expert. A great learning supplement, to review and answer questions if you forget any techniques."
4,Sturdy and stylish,This stand is very sturdy and looks great. It holds all of our entertainment equipment and saves us space. It was easy to put together. The only downside is that it does not swivel so we simply placed our LCD TV and its swivel stand on the top glass.
1,I would like an e-mail address,"I loved this iron when I bought it. The on/off switch no longer work and I cannot find the solution to this problem on your web-site. I ordered the iron on 12/19/2002, this makes it three months old. Please reply"
2,Rowenta steam generator,A truly great product while it works. Unfortunately it only worked for about 3 years. Pretty short longevity for a product as expensive as this one was.
2,Consider alternatives before purchase,"The unit worked for one year and five months and the switch died (made in France not Germany). The estimate for repair is 50-70% of the cost of the machine plus shipping to the regional service center. While the steam generator is a dream to use, the cost of repairing or replacing it is not real appealing."
5,Adding to my collection of Fons & Porter,Book was in good condition with only the color of the pages showing a little age. I was very happy with it.
2,Not what I was expecting...,"The quilts presented in the book are beautiful, don't get me wrong - but the cover photo with bright, colorful fat quarters led me to expect more of the same inside. Rather, I opened the book to find quilts made of traditional patterns and colors that do not really lend themselves to the 'loudness' I appreciated in the cover fabrics.I recommend changing the book's cover photo to more accurately reflect its contents."
5,Friendly Fat Quarter Friendly,"This is a great addition to the library of any quilter, especially those who love collecting fat quarters and have stacks of them in their sewing closet. The projects are of varying degrees of difficulty -- this book goes beyond the same simple strip quilts found everywhere (you know the ones I'm talking about -- we're all pretty bored with them). However, a beginner can find projects here, and as she improves there are more advanced quilts to tackle.There is a beautiful photograph of each finished quilt, as well as a colored line drawing. The instructions are clear and concise, and there are general quilting and quiltmaking instructions included at the end of the book.Some patterns use only a few fat quarters, and some can put to use the stash of square collecters. Many of the patterns use 60 or more fat quarters, which, of course, means you can go out and buy 60 more!"
3,complete variety of scrappy block patterns,"I bought this book solely for the large pieced flamingo ! The completed-quilt photos are mostly uninspiring, mostly dull colors. It takes a lot of imagination to choose your own colors to bring these patterns to life. But you have 30 different complete quilts to choose from, storm at sea, spinning wheels, scrappy star, mini mariner's compass, etc. An experienced quilter, I know that some are easy enough for beginners, while some are very challenging. (Not anything in the book to indicate which are which so be advised). And then there is that flamingo..."
4,"Good, haunting music by two masters","This isn't what I expected. It's a bit showing in it's era of technology, but somehow that makes it even more special. The composition is traditional Mantler, but with the melding of Don Preston, one hears a unique blending of styles. As I listen to this, this music is quite personal. Quite deep.The only real complaint is the digital drums, which are ""showing their age"" from a technological perspective. Even this complaint is diminished by the fact that they're so well used, resembling other composers at the time's artistic application.For me, this is another great entry into the Michael Mantler catalog. Not just for the completist, but for anyone wanting to explore the dark and beautiful journey that these two offer up."
2,Why do I keep going back?,"I am now on my 4th Rowenta after tossing my 3rd Powerglide that started to leak. I am convinced that there are tremendous quality control problems at Rowenta as my first one from 20 years ago worked great and each successive iron has started to leak sooner than the previous. When it works, it's great; but is sad that they leak so quickly. I don't know what else to buy, however, as other products I've purchased are no better. I have had similar experiences with buying toasters as of late; the sad state of worldwide manufacturing quality is forcing us to lower our expectations about what a good product really is."
3,DM-273,"This was a great iron, but did not last long. Every feature worked perfectly for a couple of months, but then I started having some sticking problems and suddenly it shut down completely. At the listed price, I consider it to be a disposable rather than a repairable."
1,Very Very Disappointed,"I bought Rowenta expecting it to be a far superior product. Wasn't I disappointed. The water ""spits"" at you when steaming. It instantly turns off if you sit it down for something and takes forever to get back to full heat. It would be the absolutely worst iron for anymore who sews or does crafts, as it would always be turned off when you wanted it. While ironing a shirt & going from one section say to a sleeve. It turns itself off. It was barely used and I just threw it away, therefore forcing myself to buy something else that works."
1,"we have a rowenta down. I repeat, we have a rowenta down","Sadly, after 3 years of using this iron twice a year, and then 2 months of using it twice a week, it died on us.After research online I found that this is common with Rowenta irons; there's a little circuit board in the handle that is apparently poorly constructed and/or engineered.After experiencing poor customer service, I decided to just go and by a Black & Decker 2030 which is getting many favorable reviews (and which worked better in my first ironing session that the Rowenta did when it did turn on). Plus I needed my pants ironed, and it's to cold to go outside without them.I was disappointed in the Rowenta iron; I told my wife that I thought I had bought a Cadillac of irons, and she said it looks like that was indeed the case!Alas, paying more for a product doesn't seem to ensure higher quality. If I ever run things, you can be sure it will!"
2,Good but very fragile!,"I have had this iron for at least 4 years and used it on a nearly daily basis. It has worked well but is quite fragile, the rear handle breaking with it's first fall onto a carpeted floor. I continued to use it, taped together for several more years till it started developing a short, delivering a tingling of electricity to the base. At this point I dumped and replaced it with a Black and Decker D2030. I was blown away at how much better the B & D worked. The steam is amazing and the temperature seems more stable. It also seems better built and I expect will hold up better to the inevitable fall. I can see why the B & D's are so highly rated."
3,Good Iron till the cord shorts out,"I have two of them. Nice effective iron for a year or two, depending on how heavily you use it. Then the cord shorts out. Costs 10-15 bucks to replace a cord. (Has a strange screw to discourage DIY cord replacement - like a Torx screw with a dimple in the middle of the head.)"
3,Leaks and Spits,"I have the previous Powerglide. It sputtered from day one. I kept it because I needed it and I wanted a quality iron. I followed all instructions meticulously, the proper water, draining the iron, storing perfectly. It went from sputter to clothes destroyer. Periodically it would leak and the sputters left spots. My husband had to go to work yesterday with a shirt that looked like I threw a bucket of water on him. No more Rowenta! I'm looking for another brand."
1,Iron that leaks,This iron leaked from the sides immediately after its first usage. The water tank was half full and everything leaked out from the base and it was a mess. I am never going to try Rowenta again. Very poor quality! I should have been more careful and read the reviews.
2,Great...for a while,"I've owned this iron for two years, and for the most part it has been great. About a month ago, it began mysteriously turning on and off while I would iron, making a 20 minute ironing job about 40 minutes. Well tonight it began SPARKING from where the iron meets the cord! What a danger! I have emailed Rowenta and am calling them in the morning. Be wary of this product. I know Rowenta is great for the most part, and it was the best iron I ever used until about a month ago. Again, be careful if buying this iron."
2,Disapointed,"This iron was given as a gift,and I loved it, at first. It never leaked like the others, but the rubber end to help guide the cord broke, rubbing the coating off of the electrical cord. I had to have the cord repaired. Then, it would turn off and not come back on. It did this a few times, and then I just gave up on it. I liked that it got very hot and heated up quickly. I also liked the auto turn off feature, but probably won't buy another one."
3,"Great, but not forever.","My husband and I put this iron on our bridal registry 3 years ago and we ended up getting two of them. We should have kept that 2nd one. Because now, only three years later it has shorted out!!! I read another review for this iron from someone else that said the same thing. I mean, it's not a cheap iron. You would think it would last more than three years??? Hey, it was absolutely GREAT during those three years and we raved about it to everyone. My Mom even ran out and got the same one after talking to us about how we loved ours. But c'mon, a little better quality would be nice. It's not like we traveled with it, dropped it, pulled at it and threw it down on the floor. It's an iron. You heat it up, you run it lightly over your clothes and turn it off. Shop around first. And if you find one that you really like, LET ME KNOW! Thanks! :-)"
2,Find another brand!,"model DM-273 - this is my second Rowenta. The first one was the top of the line Rowenta well over $150 and did not last long at all. The latest one (DM-273) about $70 and it did not last long either. I visit my girfrients house and use her Black and Decker which was under $20 and purchased before I purchased my first Rowenta. Never ever again will I buy a product from Rowenta. I cannot imagine how they got a good name except for the possibility people think since it's designed in Germany it must be good. Boy, have we been fooled!"
1,Rowenta Iron,I purchased a Rowenta Iron 5 Years ago from QVC. I proably used it a total of 20 hours and it started leaking and would not turn on. I would like to know where I can get it repaired and the estimated cost to do so. Plese e-mail this infomation to me.ThanksDorothy Langley
2,HELP ME FIND THE ROWENTA POWER GLIDE IRON IN LOS ANGELES...,Please help me find the rowenta power glide iron in the los angeles area it's a emergacy I accidently broke my mom's.
1,DO NOT BUY!! SAME PROBLEMS AS THE OTHERS.,"I bought Rowenta just like the others expecting that I was buying a superior product. It is probably in fact the worst iron I have ever bought. Like others I had same problems others have posted with it leaking and problems with electrical connection causing it to shut off. I thought the stainless steel soleplate would be nicer then others but it just makes it less smooth. I now own the TFAL (lavender one) that sells on Amazon for 30 and it is vastly superior in quality, features, construction, etc. Also, I also contacted Rowenta and they did absolutely nothing to help resolve the problem. Avoid buying this iron and I would probably avoid Rowenta also."
2,Leaky little devil and doesn't last long,"My wife wanted a Rowenta as it is ""THE"" iron she said, so we spent $70 on an iron that seemed to leak each time you used it from the time she took it out of the box. Then after a couple of years the iron started to turn off and on depending on the bend of the cord. Finally after 3 years + it died and into the garbage it went. Bought a $40 Panasonic NIC76SR as it seemed to be a better iron. So far it has been great. Lots of steam and heats up quick and no leaks. The detacchable water refill and retractable cord are great!"
1,"drip,drip,drip....goes the iron","This is my third rowenta iron. I have finally caught on to the fact that rowenta just doesn't make a good product. All of the irons leaked. This one in particular, leaks ALOT!! While ironing, my clothes are constantly spattered with large drops of water. The steaming mechanism does not work well either. Sometimes there is an abundance of steam and at others very little. I have learned my lesson. I will never buy another rowenta iron again.......I swear. In fact, I swear every time I use the iron!!"
3,Pretty good until it died.,"I thought this was supposed to be the Rolls-Royce of irons, so a few years ago I sprung for one. This model, in fact.It seemed as if it was good quality, but the steam spritz feature didn't always work as well as I wanted it to.The other day, after a few years, it died. To me, that's not a quality item.My old cheap irons lasted as long. I'm going to try one of those inexpensive Proctor Silex irons that got an excellent review on Amazon."
2,Be warned...,"I received this iron as a wedding present 3 years ago. It heats quickly and glides over clothes effortlessly.However, about a year ago it started leaking. Since then I haven't used the steam feature, because of the terrible leak. It's almost as if the iron has lost all capacity to hold water. I've seen the whole water compartment empty even when I don't use steam. It doesn't do much good to iron something and then throw it in the dryer to dry.My mom had the same iron prior to mine and her's did the same thing. She bought a different brand, and I think I will too. It's unfortunate. I like the smoothness of the iron, but I need steam functionality too."
4,Flamenco without feet!,"This is, overall, a wonderful interpretation by Ms. Gomez. My criticism is of the way it was photographed. These are fine dancers, but through almost the whole video, we never see their feet! We can hear the footwork, which sounds excellent, but the photographer is only interested in their faces."
1,andrew lost his mind!,"I purchased this book around November,2004. I was a bit dissapointed in the book as it was not as exciting as the other books in the series. I also think that some content could be misinterprited as evolution based. Otherwise,this is a nice time-killing book and reccomend this as a light read."
1,Jornada 720 Cradle,"In no way should anyone spend any money on this cradle....not even a peso. It's flimsy, cheap, and all around worthless. I've had my Jornada 720 for about a year now and I've found that it is easier to either purchase a USB cable or to just use the included serial cable to link my PDA with my PC. The unit constantly sticks in the cradle and sometimes causes minor difficulties in getting a good sync. When you pick up the 720 you feel like you made a good purchase...when you pick up this cradle you feel like you've just dropped a quarter into a gumball machine. Those of you with this cradle know what I mean."
5,First Democracy,"An overview of what democracy really is, where and how it started, why the US is NOT a democracy and what we can do about it. Easy and excellent read. Our legislators need this book!"
2,"New Title, But Old Tunes","As a Debby Boone fan, I was excited to see that Debby had a new release this year. However, beware! While this collection is listed as a new release, it actually is material recorded by Debby ten years ago! The album was titled ""Be Thou My Vision: Great Hymns of Faith"", released on the Benson label. These songs are not among Debby's best recordings. These versions are very ""respectful"": proper, but not terribly exciting. Her earlier Christian albums are more spirited (in every sense of the word). Check out ""With My Song..."", ""Surrender"", ""Choose Life"" or ""Friends for Life"" for some excellent vocal work by Ms Boone."
4,A literal adaptation with some flaws but honest after all!,"The story turns around a misanthropic man and an elusive woman. But there's a lot of unknown details about him and his inner world.It's literally impossible to intend dissociate this book among the most extraordinary examples of febrile existentialism portrait ever written. Somehow Steppenwolf influenced two formidable contenders of this literary tendency: Albert Camus (The stranger and Jean Paul Sartre (The nausea). So, in case you haven't read the book, you will find in a serious hook because many clues are taken from the visual that are explicitly taken from the book.Von Sydow and Sanda are in top form in this glomy picture. Don't miss it."
4,Steppenwolf,"Certainly a well-made movie, with some great moments, but given the nature of the original book -- something almost impossible to translate to film -- I'd say the movie doesn't quite reach the book's heights. If you portray the Magic Theater as a real place, it can't have the unreal, in-the-mind dimension that makes it so sublime in Hesse's novel, despite the surrealistic elements the movie adds. Hermine, Harry, Maria, and Pablo are all wonderful, but...the book is better!"
2,a double translation is (much) worse than none,"i have not read the book in german, as i cannot, and i found my english translation to be unreadable altogether...critics seem to have begun hating it for the explicit references it makes to sex and drugs, the two mainstay themes (apart from money, the easy winner) of the gogo early seventies that brought us this pretentious flik, along with hordes of equally unbearable yuppies...(preceded by equally equally unbearable hippies, who also embraced the thing, as their perceived bourgeois opponents couldn't stand it) if the book is no better than the film, it is my opinion that there is little to be understood, in spite of the many meanings that have been forced upon it...the movie is provocative, but i have to regard it as a a badjazz rendition of what was never anything significantly better than a bad book. excuse me, but hesse gets a nobel, and nabokov gets the breeze? so much for stockholm!"
4,A Good Little Phone for the Price,"I recently purchased an AT&T 210 Trimline Phone in hunter green, and I think it is a real bargain for the very low price. The sound quality is excellent, better than some more expensive phones I have used. I love the three speed dial keys located on the top of the keypad; they are so handy! The only reason I did not give this phone 5 stars is because it has no mute button. A mute button is nice to have for when you are on a phone call and don't want the person you are talking to to hear sound going on in the room. However, this is no really big deal. Overall, this is a very good little corded phone to have in your house. Everyone should have at least one corded phone in case of a power failure, when most cordless phones don't work, and this is a good choice. It is simple, and you don't get bogged down with a bunch of features that are difficult to understand, not to mention easy to tear up. This is a dandy simple little phone."
5,Buy it,"Lightweight, nice size. As mentioned the clip isn't spring loaded but no big deal. Another poster incorrectly stated this is a half-fork, half-spoon. That would be a foon which is just ridiculous. This is genuine spork: half-spoon, half-fork."
5,Perfect Hiking/Camping Buddy,"I love this spork. Don't know why but I've always been fascinated by sporks, crazy I know but I'm just strange like that. I purchased it as a lightweight alternative to a fork/spoon combo while going bike/hike/camping in False Cape State Park located in Virginia. This thing is uber lightweight and an excellent companion. Some people complained that it was too short for them but the length is just right for a stow away utensil. The clip on the end is pretty much useless as it kept coming undone during use so I just removed it. But it sure does make for a great beer bottle opener :)."
4,Satisfaction Guaranteed,"This is my third My-Ti Spork, the first one I ordered was the exact same product; when I received it, it was not the one advertised. I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent me a replacement. My mother had a stroke and has no use of her left hand and limited use of her right. I found this spork to be ideal. Somewhere along the line one of them ""mysteriously"" disappeared; so I decided to buy another one. To my delight, you were offering it for $5.00 less than I originally paid.I only gave it a 4 star because you finally sent me the advertised item with the ""bottle opener"", the ""spring"" action isn't very strong; when washing and drying by hand, it opens and closes too easily, and clips onto whatever you are using to clean it. As far as the color, strenght, and general appearance of this product, it is excellent. Thank-you very much!A.B. from N.J."
1,Not as Advertised. Wrong Picture. Rip Off!,"Ok. Let's start with what looks like a good product. Spork/Bottle opener with a clip to attach. Sounds good, looks good, BUT it's not what they send. They send you a spork that is better suited for the back of your silverware drawer. It doesn't have a bottle opener or clip to attach to your gear. Just a plain goofy metal spork. So I called the ""customer service"" number. A lady says she will have the correct product shipped out to me the next week. I get a box (by the way, these come in HUGE shipping boxes, very wasteful) and find the exact same WRONG ITEM once again. I call back and get the same lady who assures me that she will go and pick out the RIGHT product herself and send it on the way with a shipping label to return my new accumulating spork collection. NEVER HAPPENED. It's been two weeks now. . . not a letter, phone call, or email. Terrible service, aweful experience, and they don't send what you order. Word to the wise look somewhere else."
1,Also got wrong item,"Cannot review the item as I had the same problem as the other reviewer. Gave it 1 star because they're still shipping the wrong item after several months. I, too, got a regular titanium spork, not one with a clip and bottle opener. Returned it to Amazon. Never had this problem with Amazon before, even using their affiliated sellers. Shipping costs were refunded since this was their error and there was no shipping cost for me to return it. Disappointed to get wrong item, but return service was easy."
2,Projection TV,Good overall picture but out of the box needed service right away could not get picture convergence proper with the auto focus system.
5,"An Enlightenment classic, and solid look into how the human mind may work","Some concepts have been debated for centuries. ""An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue"" is a reprinting and revised edition of Enlightenment philosopher Francis Hutcheson and his argument on human nature against the many other philosophers of the era. Arguing for the internal sense of humans towards concepts of what is beautiful and the difference between right and wrong, ""An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue"" is an Enlightenment classic, and solid look into how the human mind may work."
2,Disappointment,"This CD Was uttely boring it sounded like Dianne didn't even care that she was singing. It was a disappointment to me becuase she usually is pretty excting. I felt like she didn't do enough to make this CD perfect. I mean if it was just a regualar person putting out their very first CD, it wouldn't sound like this, becuase it wouldn't sell! Okay so, I have to give it 2 stars becuase at times it sounds relazing and nice, but then I think that every Christmas CD should be as excting as Christmas really is."
3,Not As Great As Expected,"I admit it. I'm not a big fan of Elaine Costello. It seems to be that a lot of the signs in this book are English...not ASL. Of course, there aren't that many books out there about legal sign language, so it is helpful to a point. Just make sure before you start using the signs that they are true ASL signs and not Signed English."
5,great,I liked the books they were in great shape. It didnt take long to receive them either. I was very happy with them.
4,Good product,This is a good product very enthusiastically recommended by my thirty one year old daughter who'd found it helpful in assisting digestion and relieving some gastro intestinal turmoil. I have also found it to be helpful as well.
5,take it every day,as you get older you lose ability to digest food properly because you're not producing enough digestive enzymes naturally. So take it with your food and you'll find you'll better absorb nutrition from the the food you eat and you won't get upsets or digestive problems.
3,Does anyone know if this item is safe for regular use?,I use this product pretty much every day. My research such as it is seems to indicate that the ingredients are safe. But with so many conflicting opinions....Any knowledgeable amazon reviewers out there who can shed some light?:)
3,Bright Orange! Uncomfortable Handle,The hammer is bright orange as pictured so it will be hard to loose (even in my shop). My only minor complaint is that the handle isn't very comfortable.
1,REALLY STRONG SMELL!!!,"This product says it has a ""fresh clean scent"" but it's SOOOOO terribly strong that we could hardly stand to sleep in our bedroom adjoining the bathroom for several nights after applying, even with the bathroom door closed, and even after having an open window and a bathroom fan running all day. We purchased it because it said that it removes soap scum and mineral build-up, both of which we were having problems with on our ceramic tile. It did not take care of either of those issues and we subsequently had to purchase another product. It might work well enough for just normal clean-up, but because of the strong odor, I threw my can away and won't even try it for our continued maintenance cleaning."
1,"Hey, who needs facts anyway?","If you believe ""the man"" is out to get you, you'll love this book. It completely ignores reality, facts, and common sense to bring you a Marxist-Communist' ""America and Capitalism are evil"" view of current social problems. It is a simpletons approach to a complex issue (i.e perfect for college sociology courses).If you have any common sense or tend to look at things from an objective viewpoint, this book should not be read without first taking copius amounts of antidepressents.PS - I don't think this book deserves even 1 star"
4,"A work of profound sadness, ordinary people, and extraordinary reflections","What gripped my about this novel was the absolute ordinariness of the characters. Despite the fact the main character, Allison, is a former model, the characters felt very real and familiar. Mary Gaitskill has a way of stating a profound thought that almost causes one to gasp out loud with the painful, yet welcoming realization, that maybe we are all just secondary players....not really standing out, just part of the background. She provokes the reader to see the beauty in ordinary things.The ending is very open to interpretation, it left me feeling neither hopeful, or hopeless...just ordinary."
2,Poetry and Fiction blend like Mustard and Mayo,"There are some poets who can write fiction even if they aren't really poets. Marquez, clearly, is one. His sentences are poems. And yet somehow these poems cohere and tell a story that is beautiful and intelligent. Mary Gaitskill tries to pull this off in Veronica and fails miserably. The poetry is, at times, beautiful, and the story, at times, is interesting, but together they form a sloppy lit mashup that's ultimatley unrewarding on all fronts. Skip it, read here stories instead."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"I have nothing against stories about ""the dark side"" of life, and I really wanted to be moved, or at least intrigued, by this one. But frankly my dear, I don't give a damn about it. The author can't write two paragraphs in a row that are not overflowing with pretentious, baffling, ""poetic"" prose. Wading through all of that leaves the reader no time, energy or interest to care about what the author might actually mean.Every once and a while, Gaitskill hits the nail on the head with a razor-sharp metaphor or insight. But most of the time, she sounds like a stoned tenth-grader. And since you know from the start that everyone is doomed, there's not even any story to make slogging through the writing worth it.The fact that this book was shortlisted for this and a finalist for that is proof of the literary world's motto: ""If it's unintelligible, it must be good."" Ms. Gaitskill should get a copy of Myers' ""A Reader's Manifesto"" and learn."
2,Just so so,"I cannot say I liked this book very much. If you enjoy reading experimental fiction and style, then you might like this book. However, if you are looking to connect to a character, then this might disappoint. I was. I found that character development was lacking and 2 dimensional. I just found the book very negative, and the characters uninspiring. For example, why did Allison run away at first? You just find that she's unhappy and self-destructive but you never really know why. Also, Allison and Veronica have this strange relationship where Allison in the end discovers that she cares so much about Veronica, but I never fully followed what drew her to Veronica so much."
2,Maybe I just don't get it,"This book is disturbingly and explicitly sexual, but not the fun variety. It's depressingly narcissistic, though darkly poetic. Veronica is obviously a secondary character to the wonderfulness of the author, who is nice to her because it makes her (author) feel good. No Pollyanna here--I wonder at all the accolades for this book from all the critics who evidently saw something a hell of a lot more meaningful than I did. (Roll out the brown paper wrappers.)"
1,Wow this really sucked,"I rarely stop reading a book because it doesn't hold my attention. This book was an exception. Really, really badly written and not at all interesting subject matter."
3,"Gorgeous, evocative sentences that go nowhere","It's true. I spent the first few chapters of this book being impressed by Mary Gaitskill's use of language. It's gorgeous. Truly. She can take a sentence places it's never been. BUT she doesn't do the same for her characters. None of them are intriguing people. And worst of all, none of them are explored with as much depth or care as she puts into her ""in the moment"" descriptions. Not a lot happens in this book. We're not taken somewhere we don't expect to go. We don't learn anything about this world that we haven't seen in any other. From someone whose short stories delivered from start to finish, this is a disappointment. The sad truth is, I wanted this novel to be over long before it was."
4,A New Twist on the Theme of Resurrection,"Mary Gaitskill proves to be masterful in her placement of words and the creation of images. Often while reading the book, I would have to pause to take in the beauty of the image she was presenting or to suck in my breath at the sadness of what I was reading.She gives us a new twist on the theme of resurrection where instead of god-like or angelic intervention, two lost souls save each other and learn the cleansing effects of love. Mary Gaitskills shows us the beauty in breakdown and ugliness. The last sentence sums up the secret to a ""good"" life."
1,A major disappointment,"I've enjoyed Gaitskill's writing before in some of her short stories -- at her best she's edgy and dark, but here's she's slipped from dark to just plain dreary. I tried to think of something interesting about the book to give it even 2 stars, but it isn't possible. The writing about a woman dying of AIDS is dated and cliched; the model bits are mostly silly and insulting to even the most shallow of models; the parts in present tense are nearly unreadable; and the characters are simply dull. There's not a surprise in the book, not a sexy scene, not even a believable character to care about. Be warned - I read a good review of this, but I suspect that the reviewer just didn't know what to make of the subject matter, and given Gaitskill's name, probably tried to be cool by making it seem profound. But come on, we live in a post-""Angels-in-America""-on-TV world, a story about the 70's-80's + needs to be a whole lot sharper than this."
1,I Don't Get the Hype!,"I'm an intelligent person and read 3-5 books a week of all genres, but especially enjoy Philip Roth, Richard Russo and my favorite in the arena of contemporary fiction, Ian McEwan. I also read 1 biography or non-fiction a week, so I have been exposed to many writers and many syles. I'm not finished with ""Veronica,"" and I'm not sure that I will finish it. So far, I truly dislike this book. It is so disjointed, has not one character that I could relate to or even care about. I guess I just don't get it, which really surprises me. The timelines are incorrect and, as another reviewer mentioned, inaccurate. There is no continuity or depth of character. This is not the book for me."
2,Two stars is being generous...,"I was actually really excited about this book, but stopped and read Memoirs of a Geisha halfway through. Finally picked it up and finished it, but didn't really want to. Not really a conservative person, but every other line has some kind of sexual reference in it...and it just kind of gets to be too much. Basically just the random ramblings of a shallow and narcissistic woman. Makes a lot of references to people who were actual on the modeling/Studio 54 scene at the time the novel is set...great reference to Gia who is ever so cleverly referred to as Pia in the novel."
2,Just rambles on and on....,"Veronica contains little action. The story is more ""recited"" than told. The book's heroine actually had an interesting story to tell, but the writing made it boring."
1,Just throwing another 1-star into the mix,"Why on earth does anyone think this is good writing? There are enough painstakingly wrought similes and metaphors here to serve at least five novels. They are sometimes good, but for one slim volume, it's WAY too much. The reader is hard pressed to believe that anyone, no matter how frustratedly poetic, would reassess his/her life in this style. More largely, the characters and ""plot"" lacked life, the sex and sleaze failed to deliver their intended dose of shocking realism. Sigh, yawn. Didn't bother to finish it."
2,Not her best,Mary Gaitskill is best when she's poking fun at herself a little bit. She doesn't do a lot of that in this book. I recommend the story collectionBecause They Wanted Tofor more self-aware work by Mary Gaitskill.
2,Snore...,"I was on the fence about buying this book, until I found out that Gaitskill wrote the story that became the movie SECRETARY, at which point I bought the book and jumped right in, hoping it might have some of the wit and humanity of that terrific little movie. Alas, it did not. ""Veronica"" is a novel that charts new realms in humorless navel-gazing. Time and again Gaitskill sets up scenes with great dramatic, comic, or erotic potential, only to abandon them in favor of some trite observation about decaying trees or city bus drivers. And her characters evaporate the moment you turn the page. Whatever happened to STORY? Whatever happened to CONFLICT? This book has neither...just a lot of fuzzy imagery, and really good jacket copy."
2,Lighter Side My Foot!,"This is a deceptive title. This book is a hard read. Especially when the purchase here was to look at the ""lighter side"" of over weight and weight loss. My wife is not happy with this. My wife is depressed enough already."
5,A Practical Resource Worth Having,"This is simply a great resource. Easy to read, easy to navigate and easy to implement. There are so many practical ideas and enough variation for just about any size or type of men's ministry. From the administrative to the creative, it's in there. Group Publishing hit a home run with this one."
1,The worst iron I have ever used.,"The soleplate becomes draggy. This is from Starch, detergent buildup and burt synthetic fibers. However, it is difficult to clean the sloeplate and ironing has become a real pain in the you no what.Will never buy another iron like this again in my life!!!"
2,2X LOSER!,"I give this iron 2 stars because I loved the performance until I wore out the cord AND the wall plug-in due to no ""off"" button.My husband replaced the cord...didn't last long. I decided to buy another Rowenta (mind didn't leak), @ $130.00. It lasted less than 1 year and there is NO service dealer to be found!Because I paid so much, I still have them in the cabinet, hoping someday for a local dealer/repair shop to emerge. I now use a$17.99 iron from Walmart."
1,Never Again,"I don't know why Rowenta has such a good reputation!!After only a couple of months, it does not get hot enough and does not steam.The sole plate on it is difficult to clean and gunks up quickly.I lost my receipt so I am unable to return it and called Rowenta and they looked up the Serial number and since it has a shelf life of over a year old, they won't honor the warranty.Beware of this IRON! It is not all that they say it is."
2,No on and off switch,"This could have been the iron that I've been looking for but it didn't make the grade. I bought this iron because it had an automatic off switch and was a pretty heavy duty iron. It barely made it out of the box when I discovered that and it has no on/off switch. That's right, no on and off switch. Every time that you use the iron you have to unplug it from the wall. I iron nearly everyday and leave my iron set up so I will continue my search."
1,If you like water all over your clothese - Buy a Rowen,"I typically do not write reviews, but after having spent around $70 for an iron - thinking that it would be the best I could buy...I was WRONG! Rowenta must make their irons with a hole drilled in the bottom of the water storage tank or with some lame seal....something. This is the WORST leaking iron I have ever owned. I don't mean like a few spots here and there...this thing will literally pour out water on your clothes from it's hind end. Save some money...but a $25 iron and throw it away when it starts acting up on you. I now have 3 light-colored shirts that have iron piss stains on them...adding another $200 to my losses."
2,Too much leakage...now stopped heating,"Way too expensive of an iron for leaks and failures. I have now found so many people experiencing same issues. This was a gift. I will not purchase Rowenta again. They are wonderful, for a very short time. Should last longer. Rowenta should have corrected these issues by now, as year after year the reviews show leaks and puddling of water..."
1,3 time Rowenta owner.,"My 1st Rowenta lasted almost 10rs. My second Rowenta lasted 2yrs and this last purchase I am giving away. I am a perfectionist when it comes to ironing. I actually enjoy ironing! I have noticed that since this product is no longer made in Germany it does not seem to maintain the same quality standards. This particular iron was very inexpensive, leaked, did not maintain needed heat, and was troublesome when refiling."
1,Terrible Iron!,"We paid top dollar for our iron, but it started leaking almost from the beginning. It leaks on everything--just when you're in a rush. Rowenta ""customer service"" was a nightmare. Totally indifferent and borderline rude.Never again!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I, too, own a Rowenta iron because of the supposed quality. The no leak iron consistently leaked. I contacted customer no-service and they advised me to use 50/50 distilled/tap water. This did not remedy the problem. I tried returning it to the store, but could not find my original receipt. Rowneta told me to send it in for warranty work. I just wanted my money back. I ended up buying another iron."
4,Great Iron,"I ended up purchasing this iron after I read the reviews. I'm not big on ironing, but it's a job that has to be done. I debated on paying so much money on an iron. Let's face it, if you pay over $60 for an iron, you almost want it to iron the clothes for you.This is, however, a pretty good iron. You don't have to constantly go over the same area, it normally takes one or two times to get the wrinkles out. It also glides on your fabric pretty well. This helps when you're in a hurry. I have not used the steamer, but will eventually. It's one of the best irons I've ever used. You will definately notice a difference in quality (compared to the cheaper brands)."
2,Good iron except for the leaks.,This iron does a really good job but it leaks constantly when in a flat position. I get dribbles of water all over on my clothes - very annoying and leaves water spots. I bought it because I thought it was good quality and would last a while. I am writing this review to send a message to Rowenta - people who buy high end items expect better quality than this.
1,Garbage,"""Don't waste your money or time. Absolute WORST iron we've ever owned. ""Anti-Drip"" is an unbelievable joke; leaks profusely. Only one month old. Spurts, crackles and LEAKS large amounts of water. GARBAGE!!Avoid this product at all costs. Yes, Rowenta did offer to let me send it back to them so they can test it; turn around time will be 2-3 weeks. What do I do to press the families clothes in the meantime. Garbage that has caused an extreme inconvienence and hardship. My choice now is to have everyone wear wrinkled clothing for the next few weeks, or go out and buy another iron. Please don't waste your money with this company."
3,Timeless toys anyone can build,"Tired of buying your kid another mindless, souless piece of useless plastic? Then try John Nelson's book about American folk toys. Not only does Nelson delve into the history of toys in America, he also provides blueprints and step-by-step instructions on how to build them. The book should appeal to anyone interested in toys, anyone looking for gift ideas, anyone who is handy with tools, and anyone who wants to learn!"
1,"The product is great, but Vitamins.com gave me an expired product.","I love Muscle Milk products and thought that I'd get a better deal buying it online. However, after drinking 4 of them over a week, I noticed that all 8 that I ordered had expired more than two weeks before I ordered them. I will not be using Vitamins.com again."
4,"Quirky and downright odd at times, this is one of the","musical highlights of the year so far. With oddball instrumentation and musicianship from the collective known as Oranj Symphonette and funny, evocative lyrics, Lullaby Baxter Trio is something new and distinctive. Occasionally reminiscent of the British band Fairground Attraction, the Waitsian noodling of the band and Ms.Baxter's warm country 'n'jazz singing are a really winning combination. This one will surely gather fans as the year progresses and finish on many 'Best Of' lists. Now, after me, ""Mr. Powder-Blue Breadbox you're no turnip wrapped in tinsel."" Almost Beefheartian, don't you think?"
3,XP drivers don't work,"Worked great under 2000 but not XP. Others say differently, so you're on your own."
1,Mattel discontinued JuiceBox,"My daughter loves JuiceBox. She used it to listen to her favorite music. Less than 2 weeks, the speaker doesn't work any more. I called Mattel service representative; she told me that JuiceBox is discontinued product. Mattel do not manufacture same kind of products any more. No more accessorys, no more carriage. Doesn't mater how much I paid for the JuiceBox, I only can get $25 voucher which can used to buy another Mattel product."
4,"Great Read, few maps","Davis' narrative make you feel as if you are on the field with Stonewall. The absence of detailed maps, however, means you will need a knowledge of the terrain to understand fully where you are. The first section dealing with the Valley Campaign creates a wonderful build-up to his background, rise, then untimely death."
5,Artifical Neural Networks from a real neural perspective,"A variety of interesting articles concerning the neurobiology of neural networks. For example, one article by Gardner is ""Static Determinants of Synaptic Strength"". Although backpropagation as used in artificial neural networks is unlikely to be used by biological nervous systems, it is shown both in the buccal ganglia of Aplysia that synaptic strengths can be specified by postsynaptic neurons. As well, in the mammalian hippocampus, nitric oxide (NO) and arachidonic acid may serve as retrograde messengers from the postsynaptic cell for induction of long-term potentiation."
5,Fates Best,This is an amazing piece of work. Jim Matheos is absolutely brilliant. Ever since hearing him play with OSI and Gordian Knot his guitar playing has risen to an even higher level of sonic sound. Jim is becoming one of my favorite guitarists of recent times. The band as a whole is fantastic as well. Highly recommended!
3,"Like DT, something missing ...","Recent FW releases just don't move me. I can recall listening to Parallels for hours and being blown away.Recent releases are good, but don't stand out. Ray Alder - to me - sleeps through Another Perfect Day. I hear nothing in his voice, no emotion, nothing - he seems to be going through the motions. And I don't hear anything new here - no new sound, typical bland lyrics.Still good, just not nearly their best."
2,Pretentious crap,"This is one of the worst metal CDs I've ever heard. What happened to this band? Admittedly, it's been awhile since I listened to my older Fates Warning but it didn't sound like this. These songs go nowhere. The singer caterwauls every line like he has a kidney stone and the music meanders around, soft to loud then back to soft, back to loud blah blah blah. There's no structure to the songs, no imaginative riff or chorus to grab hold of. The whole CD just kind of ran togther, 50 or so minutes of the same bland melody and unoriginal guitar work. Quite a disappointment."
4,20 years and still going strong,"As I listen to the new Fates Warning, I could not help but think the keys/programming sound like the OSI project Jim Matheos was part of. A few songs are almost radio friendly as well.I miss the long epics like on the previous disc but then again I may be nit picking. I believe like many other reviews this disc is a blend of ""A Pleasant Shade of Gray"" and ""Disconnected"". The abscense of Kevin Moore on keyboards is a minus. This disc is also their heaviest since the days of No Exit. Though this still a very enjoyable disc. I recommend it."
3,Loud but moves large volume of air,This is the loudest fan in my house. Maybe louder than the central unit in the basement. I usually prefer the low setting which on this unit is too fast. I wanted a fan that was quiet on low and moves lots of air on high. You don't get that with this unit. It's full bore on all settings.
3,Nice fan but terrible delivery condition,"Good news: the fan works very well.Bad news: the fan arrived in a crappy box with holes AND the wheels MISSING (the wheels are supposed to come with the fan).AMAZON, please pay attention to the bad news comments above."
1,Poor quality,"dissappointing, especially for the amount of money paid. Very noisy and rattles, too. Sorry i bought it, now."
3,LOW STANDARD,AS FAR AS THE FAN PART OF IT IT THUS FAR IS WORKING FINE.THE REST OF IT FOR JUST A 3 STAR RATING IS THAT THE PAINT IS A ROUGH BLACK ROUGH MAT FINISH WHICH THE ADD DISCRIPTION DID NOT STATE THUS MAKES IT HARD TO CLEAN.ALSO THE PAINT WAS CHIPPED AWAY FROM THE METAL AND RUSTED WHERE THE FAN BOLTS ON TO THE FRAME.THE NUTS USED FOR IT WERE PLASTIC ACORN TYPE AND WOULD NOT TIGHTEN UP THUS CAUSING THE FAN NOT TO STAY IN THE POSITION THAT ONE WOULD WANT.ITS JUST WHEN ONE BUYS SOMETHING NEW EVEN THOUGH IT IS FROM CHINA IT SHOULDN'T BE WORST THAN WHAT WOULD GET AT A GARAGE SALE AND HAVE TO FIX IT SO IT CAN WORK LIKE IT IS SUPPOSE TO.
1,"Patton 14"" High Velocity Floor Fan",This fan was delivered in a box that had been used prior to shipping and the fan had also been used prior to shipping. The bolts on the sides were stripped and the fan would not stay in an upright position. There was a flaw in the design of the fan...the motor was positioned on the back of the fan. The fan was weighted by the motor to pull it to an upright position. In all probably this was the reason the screw and bolts were stripped when someone tried to make the fan sit as it was designed to sit. I returned it and received a refund for damaged goods.
4,strong air mover--quiet too.,"powerful and quiet, great fan ...moves a lot of air. I was trying to find a replacement for my 12"", which was amazingly powerful...but couldn't find one...try to find items near to you because shipping is expensive.ap"
1,Junk,Save your money and buy a good one(65-75 dollars). Pin came out after one days use. I reinstalled the drive pin and about an hour later the pin stuck inside the center and won't come out. Good tools are worth the extra cost.
2,Not sure how to review this one....,"It is an awesome tool when it is working. When your set screw finally rattles loose (check this often, and you will be fine), your middle spike is SHOT across the room by the spring inside. I found the spike, but did not find the spring. I contacted PSI about getting a new spring......thing has got to cost 4 cents......and they called me on the phone two weeks later to give me a product number and a different phone number to call to order a replacement spring.If I had to do it all over again, I'd would get an extra spring and spike before I ever started."
5,PSI Woodworking LCENTSS21 #2 MT with 5/8-Inch Crown Super Wood Lathe Drive Center,I have purchased this drive center and the larger one. Both have performed very well and do an excellent job of holding the material I am turning. The cost is very good and the quality is also very good. I have purchased several other products from PSI and have been very pleased with their quality and performance. These purchases have been through both Amazon and PSI. Shipments have always arrived on time and in very good packaging. The customer reps at PSI have always been very friendly and appreciate your business.
4,PSI Crown Center,"Good all around unit. I am replacing it with the same product. Have used it extensively for turning after drilling and countetsinking pen blanks. Good with metal lathes which I use to turn to round before finishing on the wood lathe. Using the metal lathe, I got a carbide cutter into mine and dinged the teeth, then tapped it out of my jet and the center flew out and I lost the center and spring. Not the tool's fault. Even with that I made a center and filed the teeth and its pretty servicable. Better price here than PSI, but check out PSI for variety."
5,Dr. John doesn't dissappoint,Had the opportunity to attend a benefit concert with Dr. John and Natalie Merchant. He shared some cuts off this new release and it is a little bit of New Orleans for everyone to share. I have also been blessed to have visited N'awlins three times and cherish the music. This release allows us to hang on to the hope that the city and music will survive.He is a truly amazing musician.
5,EXCELENTE,"BUENAS TARDES TODO MUY BIEN CON EL ENVIO ESTA EXCELENTE LA MERCANCIA, LO DISFRUTE MUCHO, MUCHAS GRACIAS, ESPERO QUE LOS PROXIMOS ENVIOS SEAN DE IGUAL CALIDAD."
1,Not enough information,"I was very disappointed in this book. Not enough sourdough starters for the average cook. For instance, ""Peach Leaf Starter"", ""Hop Starter"", etc. The book was not worth the price. Unless you want unusual recipe's, don't get this book."
3,"It's alright, but....","If this novel made sense then I might have liked it a whole lot better. Patience Goodfellow is a gurdian angel for Brady Shaw, a saloon owner in the old west. She takes her halo off and ends up being hit over the head by falling hat boxes, which, in turn makes her lose her memory of being an angel. However, she somehow thinks that she is Brady Shaw's fiancee', which, to me makes no sense. How can she lose her memory of herself, but think that she is engaged to someone. And again, with all of Kathleen Kane's novels....where is the passion?? The love scenes were mediocre and yes, there was humor, but without passion and intrigue, humor falls to the level of dull to me. I wouldn't say that no one would want to read this novel. It's a funny tale that would hold many readers attention, just not mine."
2,if you want pure fluff....,"then I say go for this book.If, on the other hand, your looking for something with SOME sort of depth, more than an inane story (like other reviewer posted-heroine is a angel, who gets knocked on the head, forgets she's an angel, but not that she's going to marry the hero?), slapstick comedy, silly word usage (the heroine's cuss word? Pestilence?) and the supposed humor in head injuries then I'd suggest another book.2 stars and that's being generous."
2,Season 7?,"Can someone answer a question? I finished all 6 seasons of ""Road to Avonlea"", but the series didn't end there. Season 6 ends with Gus Pike being lost at sea, but there was another episode where Felicity almost married Seth Pritchard and Gus returned and finally married Felicity. Where is it? Was there a 7th season or is it in something else? This is driving me crazy. Even Sara Stanley comes back in the final episode. Is there a season 7?"
3,mr bean animated series,it was good every one should see it once.it a funny series that every one will like and you can get it cheap
5,Great speaker for the money!,"This is my first cerwin-vega speaker, and for the money it is excellent! I'll be adding some floor standing cerwin-vegas soon. This speaker was the finishing touch to my 5.1 (soon to be 7.1) set up. Dialogue is loud and crisp and it's a nice size to fit in a standard media console."
5,Finally a center channel that can keep up,"For years I've had problems getting enough volume out of my center channel and surrounds. I have a set of ancient but still wonderful Cerwin Vega D3s in the front and my smaller speakers just couldn't match the volume level without constantly tweaking the mix. By refreshing my surround setup with this VE-5C along with the VE series rear and sub channels the whole system is now wonderfully balanced. This center provides such full, rich sound for dialog that I'd love to use it for my TV audio even when I'm not running my full surround setup."
4,Can be cranked to infinti and beyond!,I am using two ve-12's as my fronts and wanted a center to be voice matched. The mids and highs arent as clear as my JBL Northridgebut this is a decent center with good bass. I will keep this center speaker.
2,Disappointed in Rowenta Iron,"We normally have purchased an mid-priced iron in the past, but the last time we decided to purchase a Rowenta Iron. The purchase price at the time was around $70.00. Since we iron only a few things every couple of weeks (no children) we expected it to last quite some time. This past week it just quit heating. A 10.00 iron would have lasted as long or longer than the Rowenta did."
2,Returned this one and the Precision,"This iron as well as the Precision do not get hot enough to remove all of the wrinkles. They remove wrinkles to an extent, but not completely. I ordered a Tfal Avantis 130 and for $...less than this unit, it performed significantly better (see my review of the Tfal). The build quality of the Rowentas seemed quite good, but the performance was lackluster. I do not recommend this or the Precision. I haven't tried the DM-991, but at $...I doubt it does much better."
1,Might work as a door-stop,"My wife purchased this iron, and for the first 3 months it worked great. We didn't use it that often (maybe two or three times a week), and after about 3 months, it completely stopped heating.Emails and calls to Rowenta produced very little. Instead of replacing the iron, Rowenta told us we would have to ship it to a repair center (at our cost) and they ""might"" be able to fix it.For an iron that sells for over $100, I estimate that it cost us about $3.50 every time we used it, so I don't recommend this product, and I don't consider Rowenta's customer service to be much better."
4,disappionted,"This was my second Rowenta Iron. Didn't buy a very expensive one at first. Thought that explained why it didn't last very long. The plastic dial fell off and broke, unable to adjust temp. I did like the way it perfomed so I purchased a DM880 model. thinking it would last for many years. After about 3 years it would not heat constantlty. Thought it was short in the cord but couldn't find anything wrong with that. I contacted Rowenta about the problems I've had and all they said was they don't guarntee products after 90 days. The problem is mine not theirs. Told me how to store the cord which in fact I purchased a special clamp for the cord when I bought the iron. Not pleased with response from ROwenta. So be careful when spending a lot on money on their so called professional line. I loved the way they ironed when they worked!!!!"
1,Think carefully,"I have an older version of this professional model purchased for about $139. I guess I expected too much. I will not purchase another Rowenta iron. After a year I had to have it repaired as it just stopped working. That cost $40. I have used it for about a year and a half since it was repaired, doing light ironing on weekends. Just now, I plugged it in. It crackled like fireworks, sparked and shorted out. Quite frightening. That's it for this iron. It was also heavy. I had more success with my inexpensive Black and Decker."
1,1st impressions great ... survivability HORRIBLE,"we use an iron about once a week and initially this was everything as expected after about a year however ... the iron suddenly quit working ... warranty is only in northern california (500 miles from me) and 2 other places and requires 2 weeks, so unless you have a ""backup"" iron, it is essentially worthless, tech support is NON-existant and the service rep claimed this problem occurred due to hard water even though our last iron lasted over 10 years with the same water.I offered to follow any diagram or instruction that they could or would give me but they said ""if the iron won't heat, it REQUIRES shipping to service facility, no exceptions or assistance available"".The iron looks brand new, it jest doesnt work ... i suggest great care in paying a ""premium"" price for a ""non-premium"" product."
1,Performance,"Within less than several months of using this product, performance problems began. The first problem wasinsufficient steam. Second, the iron would not stay heatedwhile in use. Now, less than a year from purchase,the iron will not heat. Following the trouble shootinginstructions does not resolve the problem. Unfortunately,I purchased this iron a year before actually using it so, it'sout of warranty. I'm off today to buy a new iron. Trust that it will not be this brand. A relative also purchased this iron and she, too, had problems."
1,Short service life - Avoid Rowenta,"I bought this item thinking it was a premium product. After about a year, it stopped heating. Recently, I took it apart to figure out why it conked out. I think it was an overtemperature cutout switch. The problem is, that cutout switch doesn't reset! So if you have one temperature excursion, you have a paperweight.I kind of fixed it, but it has no overtemp protection now. Pretty lame.If this typifies Rowenta design and workmanship (it was made in Germany, for gosh sakes), I'll never buy Rowenta again. Poor reliability, hard to fix, no spare parts... All this, plus twice the cost! The cheap, Chinese-made Black and Decker we have is still going strong after six years."
2,Stops Working Too Soon for the Price,Great iron until the day it decides that it is finished! This was my second Rowenta. If Rowenta can't figure out how to make their irons last longer than a year or so - I am buying the cheapies from now on! Even if I break down and spend a little more money again - it won't be on a Rowenta...
1,Died,This is the second Rowenta iron to die on us. The power started cutting out frequently and it leaks water sometimes. We're going to try a Panasonic iron.
1,No stars if I could,"I was expecting great things, between the price and the Rowenta reputation. Boy have I been disappointed.Since when can one not use steam on wool? That's what's indicated on the dial - the ""steam"" area doesn't start till well past the ""wool"" setting. duh,I could live with that BUT this darn thing spits and drools. Spits - leaks water when pressing, this pressing cotton on the cotton setting. Every time I make a pass with the iron it leaves 2-3 water spots each the size of a dime. It also occasionally leaves a dark smudge as if there were dirt on the sole plate. Then on dark clothing it spits out some white substance that looks like it might be calcium deposits - though I don't use hard water in this iron.Feh. For what I paid I could have sent my shirts to the laundry for six months or more.Never again, Rowenta!"
1,It leaks badly,we have a new one. the water runs right out of it. It is going back to the store fast
1,Not worth it,"I purchased this iron February 2004, believing that it was a top of the line product. This iron caught on fire while ironing, I had it for approximately 1 1/2 years. I have had ten dollar irons that have lasted longer than this. I'm very disappointed with this product.Joel"
3,Doesn't get hot enough.,"I have the P2 Professional Anti-Drip Rowenta, and it does not get hot enough to remove the wrinkles. I have to go over the fabric several times to remove the wrinkles. The iron does not drip and has an excellent steam function. It just doesn't get as hot as other, more inexpensive, irons seem to get."
1,Works great for 10 months,I was completely happy with the everythign about this iron until one day the steam function just quit operating out of the blue. One day fine the next day ka-put. I am dubious about recomending a purchase of one.
4,Elan,"I am a first time parent and I received a couple packages of these bottles before the birth of my daughter. She really seems to like these bottles, I am not so sure about the whole gas reduction that they are supposed to deliver. She likes the shape of the nipple and is thriving. The only thing i don't like about these bottles is that when you put them together you need to make sure the pieces are dry or they leak. They also will loose a little water out the bottom when you first shake up the formula. But after that inital leak they are good to go."
2,waste of money,I purchased these bottles for my son and they are horrible! The nipple collapses several times during a feeding. It is also difficult to put the nipple back on the ring after washing.
2,LEAKAGE,These bottles would be perfect if they did not leak from the bottom. I fell like I just waisted my money. The rubber on the bottom leaks formula spilling it all over the baby.
1,He Never Explains Why!,"The title is *WHY* the Germans Lose at War. I read the book and all I saw was a bunch of high level summaries of battles fought and lost by the Germans. I never saw an analysis of *why* beyond the author slamming the Germans as being arrogant. There is nothing new presented in this book - not even something as simple as taking a different point of view. This book is nothing but German bashing and I am ashamed to have purchased it. If Amazon had allowed me to rate this as zero stars, I would."
2,Eh. All hype and no punch.,"I was expecting a wild hedonist's guidebook to the varied wicked delights of this wonderful city. Instead, I got a punchlist of pricey places that were by and large already covered in the Time Out and Lonley Planet guides to Berlin. Save your money and get those instead, and hit various online guides to Berlin to find the really fun spots instead."
3,Not suitable for Ethernet,"This cable is very tricky to use properly. It is below the minimum segment length for 10Mbps or 100Mbps Ethernet. If you always use this between two gigabit ethernet device, don't use this for ethernet, or always use it along with other cables so that it is not the only cable in a segment, you will be fine.I do not advise having UTP cables less than 8 feet in length around. It is too easy to accidentally use them to connect fast ethernet devices together.""All copper Ethernet segments that run the Collision Detect (CD) portion of CSMA/CD have a minimum cable length to function properly because of reflections."""
5,nice mouse,"great mouse, the little stickythings on the botton make it feel as if its gliding on air with no effort, which is good when ur scoping someone in the head in BF2 and need to follow them for that headshot. Great nouse, has 800 or 1600 dpi, lights up when u move it, but thats useless since ur hand coveres the part and u cant see it at all, good buttons, great mouseImaYam <Check me out at BF2"
1,It stinks,"Literally, it smells. I think it's the plastic and it leaves a smell in your hand after using. Over time, it's dissipated somewhat. The first mouse I received was DOA and had to be returned. As a gaming mouse, it's mediocre, but lowest price 1600 dpi mouse out there. I would get something else if I had a bigger budget. Blue glow is nice."
3,Value But No Rain Fly Makes Me Wonder,"I will update this review after my first overnight in the rain. I've just set up the tent and was surprised there was no rainfly included. As a minimum this would help with condensation. I have a Sierra Designs tent with a partial rainfly and am sold on FULL rainflys. They are a great insurance policy. Also, there is no custom footprint sold separately, which I would like to have. Yes I can somewhat easily make my own. That said. The tent went up in a heartbeat, looks sturdy, is lightweight, and the vestibules are wonderful, especially in the expected rain here in the Pacific NW"
4,Great for programmers who are new to Fortran,"This book provides a basic outline of Fortran 77 for elementary programmers. I was previously only familiar with C++ (only one introductory class). This book helped me learn the basics of Fortran quickly and efficiently, but it does not cover any advanced topics."
2,Joust,"I have been an avid fan of Mercedes Lackey for years and have read each and every published work I could lay my hands on. My question is ""who wrote this book???"" Not Mercedes Lackiey - unless it is something from her very early writings. Her usual savvy style, humor, and rich characters are totally missing in this book. And the abundance of typographical errors indicates lack of care or a ""copy and paste"" of manuscript bits from several sources. Perhaps because I am such a great fan of hers, I expect more from her books. One thing I will say, the cover is absolutely gorgeous."
5,Finally!,"I have finally gotten the 1st book in a series! I could not let myself read the book I had till I got all of the first 3! I always seem to find the middle book or last one, this time I am enjoying from the start!"
4,One Of Lackey's Best,This is a really well written book. This was just an exceptional piece of writing for her. I enjoy her stuff normally but this one was quick and fun to read.
2,Not a Lackey lackey,"I've always shied away from Lackey's novels in the past. I hate to admit it, but the cover art just really puts me off. But a moment of weakness in a checkout line provoked me into buying this one. Hmm...It had me hooked at first, but halfway through the novel the story line just fell apart. I love a good underdog-makes-good story, but her plot devices required too much of a leap of faith at times; the largest being an eleven year old dragon drudge hiding a newly hatched and RAPIDLY growing dragon under the noses of a strict dragon culture. Nope, didn't work for me. Aside from the fact that a book buddy caught me reading it and teased me unmercifully for days, I just might see what the Valdemar (sp?) fuss is all about."
4,Liked it but very close to Jane Yolan's Dragons Blood,I enjoyed the story very much but I'm concerned by how closely it paralles Yolan's Dragon's blood. I'm sure it wasn't deliberate and I look forward to a sequel. I didn't see much comparison with McCaffrey's dragons at all. The similarities between this one and Dragon's blood are basically that a bond servent / slave steals a dragons egg and raises it to adulthood to gain his freedom. In Dragons Blood the dragons are used for arena fighting and in Joust they are used for airial combat in a war.
3,too similar to yolan,"I'm a fan of most of her other books, and this one would have gotten a better review if i had not previously read Jane Yolan's ""dragonsblood."" This book really was shockingly similar, so much so that it made me slightly uncomfortable. I would recommend reading Yolan's book instead, since it had almost the same plot, but written in a more appealing way."
1,Coasting by on Name Recognition,"I have been really disappointed in many of Ms. Lackey's more recent books. Too many of them seem contrived--just ""money books"" that she knows will sell on the basis of her name. This book is just more of the same. I didn't feel that it was original or fresh or even that well written. I am particularly tired of the excessive use of italics in all of her works. People rarely think or talk in italics. Some of the best books I've ever read are by this author. This just makes her later works all the more disappointing."
3,Eqyptians et al.,"A take off on the Eqgyptians (Tians) and some of their old foes -- not sure where the Altans come from, but then, I was never a big fan of Eqyptian history. A good book, and well done. Better than some of her more recent ones -- I would recommend this, although you might want to wait for the paperback if you've read a lot of dragon stories. This had a lot of parallels with Anne McCaffery's Dragon series -- mainly in the care and feeding of dragons."
3,"Great potential, but no proofreading!!","I was pleased to see Mercedes Lackey introduce a new novel, and she has done an excellent job of bringing to life a new culture. I hope she will, as the ending leaves WIDE open, write more books in this setting.However, I have to say that someone has done an absolutely pathetic job of editing this book. Information is ""introduced"" repeatedly within a few pages of the previous ""introduction,"" as if no one actually read the entire book before it went to the printer. Someone else referred to it feeling as if it had been done ""cut and paste"" from several manuscripts, and that may be the explanation. Maybe they were rushing to meet a deadline, but it was a serious disappointment.With more care and attention, this could be an excellent new series. I'll keep my fingers crossed!"
2,Disappointing...,"I love lackey. Her Heralds of Valdemar and Last Herald Mage books are among my all time favorites. This book, hoever, must be among the weakest of her works that I have read to date. It is set in a pseudo-Egyptian culture where Dragons exist. The main character is a young serf boy who decides to attempt to raise a dragon as his only chance at freedom. Sad to say, that brief description completely encompasses the scope of this book. There is NO character developement, no plot development, no surprises. If any of you have ever read Jane Yolan's Dragon Boy ( title may be incorrect but I think i got the author right) then you have read this story and in a much better form. This book did not even read like Lackey. I hate to say it but I can not recommend this book at all. It is easily forgotten and won't leave any impressions on your psyche"
5,Exciting,"You can't go wrong with Mercedes Lackey. Seems as though everything I have read from her, I have thoroughly enjoyed. Again, another of my favorite authors."
4,Good item,"This is very good for giving plastics that ""new"" feel. Without knocking this product too much, I have to give ""Brillianize"" the nod over Novus.That being because of the haze that Novus leaves behind.But the haze wipes off with some extra effort. Novus gets 4 stars, Brillianize gets five with regard to quality and ease of use.Try as I might - I can't find a bulk container of Brillianize on Amazon.So I'm GLAD that I can buy the Novus here.These are both under-utilized products - and that surprises me. Still a well-kept secret....TIP: Try the Novus scratch removers - they are superb. IMHO"
5,Great For Soft Plastics (Convertible Windows),"Great For Soft Plastics (Convertible Windows), which tend to go cloudy often! Requires some ""elbow grease,"" but well worth it!"
5,"If you can find it, buy it!!!!","Karen mantler is unique, morose, funny, but always a proffessional jazz artist at heart. This CD is probably discontinued by now. But is defintely one of my favorites."
5,"A Duffer's Perspective -- Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful","I don't take pictures. I don't plan to take pictures. And I am certainly no expert on color photography. My raw, uneducated reaction to this book is this: the amount of detail, texture, and variations of color captured on these pages is quite astounding."
4,A decent one for a beginner,"This is a good book for people interested in close-up and macro photography, its advice is helpful and clear. However, you should consider the volume by Ronan Loaec and Gilles Martin instead. It is somewhat deeper into the subject, but the main reason I recommend it is because Davies' photographs, while perfect, look amateurish compared to Martin's ones, especially judging the artistic aspects."
5,excellent detail! Excellent book,"I must say i am completly satisfied with the book. It cover all aspects of macro fotography,hardware, lighting, aperture,flash etc. It also goes into extreme detail in explaning other factors including exposure, calculations and so on. It tells you how to do macro photo in different scenarios.Amazon just happen to have this book in stock cheaper than my local bookstore."
1,STAY AWAY,"Stay away from this film.It's that simple. While the information is correct, the text the narrator is reading from has too many grammatical errors to count and he mispronounces many names of both people and places."
2,Constantly resets itself!,"While this pedometer looks good and feels comfortable, the reset button is vulnerable and just leaning over a counter can reset it. I've lost many counts. Also, the other buttons are in vulnerable places and are constantly being pushed. Very frustrating."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this little number, because a friend and I were starting to walk. It worked for about 1 week. I returned it 2 times for different brand new, still in the package devices. Each one had the same effect. I haven't been able to find a decent pedometer yet."
1,dont waste your money,well dont waste your money.... mine lasted about a month... so i pitched it.. not worth the time or trouble sending it back.. its a piece of junk..
4,Helpful Information,This is a great little book that helps give healthcare persons and caregivers information on dementia.Reads easily and gives good information.
1,"Shallow characters, OK plot","These were the most one-dimensional characters I have ever come across. The good characters were so incredibly perfect both physically and morally, and the bad ones so evil, I kept expecting the next page to be a cartoon panel showing them donning their super-hero and arch villain costumes. I was rooting for the bad guy, he seemed the most human. The minor characters were all mindless robots incapable of showing more than one attitude or response. A shame, since the plot was actually interesting."
2,"Same old, same old","I usually love Julie Garwood and I was really looking forward to this book. The John Paul character is just so, well, blah. He is described as really good looking and easily intimidates others around him, I never really get him. Why would he just fall in love so easily if for all intents and purposes he is so aloof and unapproachable. I know, I know, the love of a really good woman, but that's not what I felt. I felt this was just the standard Julie Garwood plot, girl meets boy, boy doesn't want to get involved with girl, girl is in trouble so boy MUST help girl and then realizes at the tidy end that he is in love with girl and will accept no other answer than that she will marry him and live happily ever after. Sorry, I just didn't buy this story."
4,Fun characters and a fast=paced read...,"If you're looking for a meaningful novel with subtext and complexity, this isn't it. What you'll find instead is a fun book that I read in a weekend. I was delighted to see the return of Noah to help Avery & John Paul rescue Avery's aunt from a hired killer, Monk, who we first met in Garwood's novel, Mercy. But you don't have to read that book to appreciate this one. The romance is a bit stretched -- but you'll end up falling a little in love with John Paul anyway!"
3,Mercy better!,"This is the 3rd Garwood book and I liked Mercy the best so far. There were a lot of things I thought could have been done better -first, the character of Carrie - were we suppose to like her? I didn't. The end(the accomplice) - where did that come from? I have to say, I would read Garwood again, but this was not her best effort."
3,Family feud,"When it comes to compelling novels of relentless suspense, Julie Garwood is in a class by herself. She is a dominating force in the craft of creating living, breathing characters in gripping situations. This offering takes us into the life of Avery Delaney, abandoned by her mother 3 days after her birth and raised by her Aunt Carrie and Grandmother Lola.Now an adult, Avery works as a crime analyst for the FBI and possesses an uncanny talent for scrutinizing and deciphering clues. She must utilize her deductive gifts to find her Aunt Carrie, who has disappeared as well as stay one step ahead of a killer named Monk.Although Garwood will never win the Nobel, the Booker, or any of the other prizes bestowed for writing prowess, she definitely takes home the gold in the category of ""Fun light reading, no in-depth analysis required""."
2,Readable? Yes. Memorable? No.,"I've been reading Julie Garwood since her early work in historical romance; marvelous books such as ""The Bride,"" ""Honor's Splendour,"" and ""Saving Grace"" captivated me and kept me reading for hours. Once done, I'd want to start again. Her pages were full of clever wit, suspensful intrigue, and beautiful romance, elements that Ms. Garwood's contemporary romances, including this latest one, seem to lack. Readable? Yes. Memorable? No."
5,Amazing Suspense,"I really enjoy suspense novels, and Julie Garwood really appealed to me in her latest book, Killjoy. Once I started reading, I hated to stop. I had to know what happened next. Ms. Garwood's ability to develop characters makes her one of my favorite authors. She not only creates amazing characters and story lines, she is able to add humor in the appropriate places. I love all of the elements, and can't wait for her next one."
2,Tripe,"I bought this book because I had enjoyed Mercy, her earlier novel, involving some of the same characters. This book was very poorly written, as though Ms. Garwood had been under a great time pressure. Her dialogue was trite, the story development was simplistic, and the characters: the very bad (Jillie) and the very good (Avery) were not very well sketched. Overall, I very much resented having bought his book in hardback and having wasted valuable time reading it."
1,LUDICROUS!,"This is right up there in the top five of the worst books I've ever read. (Actually, I listened to it in audio format.) Amateurish, childish, clichéd prose, unbelievable characters, a stupid plot, and the most hilarious dialogue. If this is the way people speak in historical romance novels, I'm glad I don't read them. But this is supposed to be a contemporary setting and no one in real life talks the way these characters do. The descriptions of sex and romantic scenes made me laugh out loud.How do writers like this get published? This is a royal stinker! Don't waste your time. If you want a good suspense novel, there are hundreds of better writers out there than Ms. Garwood."
3,A little boring,"I am an avid Garwood fan of both her historicals and her contemporaries, but I felt Killjoy came up short. It was hard for me to like John Paul after thinking he was an inconsiderate, unlikeable brut in Mercy. Overall, I felt the plot was decent but the romance aspect was clearly lacking. I felt that Avery, as a character, was portrayed as a weak individual who was so overwhelmed the entire time. I felt this was quite a contrast to Garwood's past female leads who are strong-willed and witty. My advice - borrow it from a friend who buys it in paperback."
4,Fun storyline!,I enjoy anything written by this writer as a rule and KILLJOY is added to that list. I enjoyed reading about the new characters in this story as well as some characters the reader was already introduced to. If you enjoy a good time while reading then you should read this book!
4,A real page turner but missing an important element!!!,The book is great! I couldn't but it down. I would have given it 5 stars except Garwood missed one important element..... She failed to allow Avery to come face to face with Jilly. Otherwise...an excellent book.
1,Why Julie Why,"Killjoy is better than Heartbreaker by half a star, which isn't to say it's any good. Our hero and heroine are one dimensional, there is a psychopath killer and another psychopath telling the killer what to do. Boring. Our hero is the strong silent type and our heroine is another leggy blonde who isn't as useless as she looks. Honestly. Julie Garwood tells the reader every chapter how not useless, just leggy, she really is.If you don't like character development and prefer action this is the book for you. If you are a historical Julie Garwood fan and looking for romance avoid this one. Borrow it don't buy it."
4,Killjoy is a joy to read...,"Although I am a diehard Julie Garwood romance fan, I have to say that I enjoyed this suspense novel as well. Julie has gifted us all with her talent for many years now and I feel she has done well with her leap into a new genre. KILLJOY was a great adventure read and one that kept me coming back for more. I do hope Julie will still write a straight romance soon!"
2,Uh uh,"I didn't care for this book at all. After Mercy, and her other earlier novels, which were good, this was a real letdown. Compared to other authors mystery/romance novels, this was a disappointment. Garwood's characters and plot were not believable. I hope her next novel gets back to her norm."
4,Killjoy's pretty good,"Killjoy is a pretty good book. What gives is 4 stars is the lack of tension between the 2 until the middle of the book. Great mystery and once the tension was there, it was good. Avery was tough and a true match for John Paul. It was fast paced and a very enjoyable read."
1,"Oh, brother ...","This was the most disjointed book I've ever read. Cardboard, almost caroonlike, characters. No real humor, lots of repitition (""oh, brother"" and ""suck it up"") and very little suspense. It did have a great cover, though."
2,Two Thirds of This Book Is Pretty Good,"After a slow, and unfortunately mandatory prologue, this novel becomes a fairly pleasurable quick read. I guess you could call it a ""riller"", a cross between a romance novel and a thriller. The main characters talk a great deal about how good they are at their respective jobs (big bad dude and beautiful FBI analyst). Neither prove their mettle in proportion to their boasting, although the heroine displays a couple of spurts of yoga-transcendental-meditation-mediated mental acuity. I've never read a romance novel, so I was surely surprised to note that a woman's lips could be swollen from kissing. And there is a lot of smooching; pages of it, with tongues reaching so deep that I suspect that livers were licked. Lastly, the ending was told in the style of a flashback reminiscent of the events, which was a somewhat disappointing departure from the style of the rest of the narrative."
2,Disappointing Book From a Fabulous Author,"What a disappointment! I loved Garwood's first contemporary novel, ""Heartbreaker"", and was excited to see more from the characters in ""Mercy"", but ""Killjoy"" lived up to its name. My complaint is simply that there is WAY TOO MUCH action/violence and not enough relationship development. Garwood went overboard with the suspense, and this loyal reader got left in the dust. I never connected with the characters, so I had a hard time rooting for them. I've had this problem with about 1/2 of Garwood's contemporaries (""Slow Burn"" is another dud). I really wish she'd go back to writing her historicals for a while."
3,Not as good as her other's,"I am a Julie Garwood fan and have read all of her books. Killjoy is the 3rd of her series including Heartbreaker and Mercy. The main man in this book is John Paul, the brother of Dr. ""Mike"" from Mercy. The storylines from the previous two books are continued in Killjoy, however, it can be read as a stand-alone.Garwood is a fabulous writer. Once you start one of her books it is difficult to put it down. In my opinion, Killjoy was not as good as her other books. I had been anxiously awaiting a book with John Paul and this didn't live up to my expectations. None of her books are bad, but this just didn't grab me the way her other books did. I reccomend you wait until it comes out in paperback. Don't spend the money on hardback."
5,Killjoy,"I loved this book. Great suspense, action and wicked humor. The various characters are well defined, their interactions with each other are very interesting as well as funny in some instances. Good read."
1,"""Blue"" from The Rhapsody""","I disliked the somewhat slowertempo, especially the piano's.I was furious over the disgustingmicrophone placement during thethe recording and/or remastering!End result: I had to turn volumneup during piano solo and when fullorchestra converged ... `KA-BOOM !!"
2,Very General materials with no useable specifics,"This book is jammed pack. However, it is not jammed pack with very much useful information. It is all exteremly general in nature. I was hoping for a ""how to""/""what to watch for"" and all I got was 500+ pages of general ""You should have a financial plan before inversting..."" type of advice. Very disappointing for the cost."
5,Read now and pay later,"The purpose of purchasing this book, which has only been scanned, is to supplement my prior readings and research upon United States history and the treatment of the Native Peoples, in particular the means by which their tribal lands were stolen. I will complete this book this summer, along with others. I am sure it is worthwhile judging from the index."
3,Provisional evaluation,"I wanted a study guide that I could use by myself. This book is probably excellent for a teacher of a class studying the bible, but is does not seem to contain enough interpretative information for the use I intended."
4,Bible Study,Through the Bible in one year is a good way to read the whole bible. This product is used for the church's weekly bible study group and is an excellent way to go through the bible.
3,Good For Beginners,"This study is good for beginners; folks who 'just want to get started'. It's simple and provides a good outline for the studier to follow. If you're looking for more than a guide through the Bible; or somthing that provokes deeper thought, you may want to keep looking."
4,Predictably pretty good,"Being a playboy product, you know the images will be clear and well focused, the models beautiful, and the sets adequate if not ravishing. What you can also predict is that the film will have a detached air about it that precludes the viewer from feeling any emotion ties to the on screen action, so that you see basically a slide show of pretty pictures and nothing more."
2,posing posing posing - boring!,"Although the girls are beautiful and sexy, I thought the description of the movie was more ""girl on girl"" soft-core. All the girls do is pose. I am very disappointed."
1,More Like How to Use Web Matrix,"This is a terrible starter book, going into intricate detail about how to use MS Web Matrix, and ignoring getting a person started in really programming in asp.net. When finished you'll be well accomplished in using Web Matrix and won't have a clue how to start writing any more then the most simplistic code. If i heard 'however thats beyond the scope of this book' one more time....@#$@#$#$. Do yourself a favor, and find a better starter."
2,Misleading and mistakes everywhere,"I would not recommend this book to anyone, as it ignores the fact that there are other tools on the market, and keep telling people that you have to input HTML codes manually. There are also so many mistakes in the book that make the reading difficult. Even if I have been following his instructions on the exercices closely, some times the resulting web pages won't run at all."
4,They seem very strong,"They appear to be strong laces, they are also long which is a + in my book. The only problem which i guess is more of a give and take. They are made of a material which is strong but they dont have much friction so they untie easily, even when using a double knot they will come undone."
5,good stuff,"Its convenient to be able to get these laces with such high quality at the click of a mouse . Buy two sets there were 3 laces in each set , so I ended up with e sets !!!! Awesome !!"
1,Do not purchase,"We bought this for our now 20 month old son. After 6 months of use, it will no longer turn on. It is a piece of junk and can not be returned, because it has already been replaced by a newer version."
1,Very unhappy,I have been trying to purchase the Learn Through Music complete system with Microphone and have been unsuccessful. I would purchase the cassettes to go with it for 4 grandchildren but can't unless I can purchase the complete system. One child has the system but the other three don't. This has me very upset and hope you will replenish your stock soon.
5,Isla Verde,"What a magnificent book! Even if its very light reading, it was just what I was looking for. A book you can read in one or two days by the pool on your Caribbean or Miami vacation. A little bit lopsided in his views, the central character believes that the relationship between PR and the US is unilaterally unfair and that the US is getting the worst part of the bargain.The author is a little naive in those relative terms, especially when you look at the number of deaths of PuertoRicans in the last 60 years versus Americans in war or military situations. Nonetheless, the romance is there and at least the plot will wet your appetite to read a lot more or actually visit the little but complex Island. The author describes the Virgin Islands as I have experienced them and as your worst fears would materialize, adding suspense to the romance.Buy this book and pass it along!!!"
4,no title,"Terrell wrote ""Black Robe"", which was turned into one terrific flick, and the co-author, (mysteriously not mentioned here), Colonel George Walton, wrote ""The Devil's Brigade"", also a great movie. Written in 1966, this book is about Major Marcus A. Reno and his controversial role in the campaign culminating in the Battle of the Little Big Horn and the Custer Massacre. It relates his life, from birth to death, along with a nice synopsis of the Civil War. This man surely lived under a dark star, if ever a man did. Orphaned as a child, wife died young, and went through two courts martial and one Court of Inquiry. Exonerated of all attempts to make him appear a coward and thus become the scapegoat for Custer's own incompetence, he nevertheless seems to have been a hard-drinking, rough sort of man after his wife died so suddenly and so young. He did not make friends easily and died alone. A fascinating book."
1,the worst set of music I've ever heard,"This is the worst CD set I've ever listened to. The first track on each CD is a good piece, but then the situation promptly disintegrates into 40 minutes per CD of (...)synth and birdie-in-the-forest noise -- (...).So... if that's your idea of a ""blissed out beat"", then you're welcome to it."
5,Adam rules!,"Just saw him, live, tonight. He is a wonderful songwriter/performer. This CD is a must for those who have an ear for original, artistic and heartfelt music. Adam pours his soul into his music and touches the hearts of those listening!"
4,Secret of Moonacre,My daughter loves this movie & brings it home from the library every week & I was thrilled to find it so cheap on Amazon!
3,"But it's not ""The Little White Horse""","""The Secret of Moonacre"" is an enjoyable film with the outlines of Goudge's ""The Little White Horse,"" but it is not that story. Sir Benjamin Merryweather is a very different person, not the fatherly uncle of the book. The charm of the book is missing. To leave out ""Old Parson"" is to miss much of the wisdom. However, the photography is wonderful, including the skylight (not in the book) of the tower and the closing encounter by the sea on the Thousandth Moon is epic in mood. Though I enjoyed the film, I suspect that Miss Goudge, with whom I had some correspondence, would not be happy."
4,the secret of the moonacre,I did not have a very good idea when I rented this movie of what to expect. I found it to be quite interesting. A fun family movie with a good message of forgiveness and sacrifice. I enjoyed it.
5,What a surprise,"I had never heard of this movie when I took a chance and rented it when my grandchildren were coming over. What a hit! It was appropriate for my 6, 8, and 10 year old. They liked it so much, we had to take it to their house to share it with their mom. She loved it! So I just had to go to Amazon to add it to my library because I know we will be watching it again and again."
2,The Secret of Moonacre,"I did not really enjoy this movie. The book it is based on is quite lovely, and bright and positive, whereas the movie has changed the story to a dark, slightly depressing tale. The characters' personalities are very different as well - they are generally angry, sad and annoying. Though there are some very good actors in the movie, I found the standard of acting to be quite poor.As an adult who loved the book ""The Little White Horse"", I did not like the changes they made to the storyline and characters as I felt they were quite negative. The book had the contrast of light and dark, good and evil, however the movie just seems to be very dark overall.A young friend however (a 5yo little girl) quite enjoyed the movie and found some bits quite funny."
5,Wonderful feel good family flick,"Without having ever read the book, I found this to be a wonderful movie. My daughter Kennedy and I watched it tonight and it inspired me to order the book this very night. Knowing that books often surpasses the movie, I am extremely excited.Unfortunately, there are a lot of cartoons and children movies that are just vulgar nonsense. I can actually feel myself slipping into a mind numbing trans at times. I can't bare to think what it is doing to our children's developing minds. I have found a lot of things that I am actually very proud to share with my daughter and this is on that list. It helps me build her inspiration and imagination.As a writer, it has inspired me to put pen to paper. Perhaps the work will inspire more family friendly movies...Many Blessings,LR"
2,Really good staging and sets silly adaptation of a French kids book.,this is for the three through seven crowd. The sets and photography are above average and the adaptation of the story is about as coherent as the directions to assemble a trike that you got from China. If you really must see this--You don't need to. Put it in for the three year old girls sleepover and go get a drink.
4,Mysterious and fun,"The classic black and white, good and evil but hmmm not always as clear as that, so a fun fantasy story that has wonderful charactures and a good message, I liked it and recommend it"
3,"OK, if you haven't read the book","This film is based on the book ""The Little White Horse"". The book is sooooo much better on so many levels. The film really cheapened the story, made friends into villians, and removed many of my favorite parts.But if you haven't read the book the film is okay for an evening of entertainment."
2,Muddled and odd,"I love a good kid's fantasy movie as much as the next person, but this one lost us early on. Overlong and tedious. And why does the teen heroine's dresses get more and more low-cut with each scene? The ending seems rushed and slapped together with the special fx particularly cheap."
3,It could have been so much better,"Good yes, but the costuming was atrocious, especially for the heroine. The story could have been developed better as could the flow of the story. The character of the governess was just not something that fit well. In short, it was enjoyable as there are few movies like it, but it could have been so much better."
3,The Secret of Moonacre,I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. I had seen the recommendation on the website and took a chance.
1,could be a usefull resorce,"lots of info, if you are a trivia fan : this is book you may enjoy, if not my feeling is that you should seek a better rated product.I do not recomend you this book : it was a waste of my money....."
1,A book solely for a few Americans,"This book might be interesting to some Americans, but seriously lacks an international touch. All in all it is very difficultto learn something worthwhile from this book (other than for instance if you're interested in learning the flavours of Basket Robbins ice cream)."
2,Not much use for crosswords,"I bought this in the hopes it would be a good reference for solving crossword puzzles. Well, I have never once found what I needed in this book. So this is a warning to others: the trivia in it is not useful for crosswords. Since the book may be good for other things, just not what I bought it for, I gave it 2 stars. To me it's worth zero."
3,"Good for pop culture, but has some errors","I bought this to study for a Jeopardy try out. While it is very heavy on events and people from the last 100-150 years, it does lack in more historical trivia. Definitely a nice book, but not a definitive resource for all around trivia.One thing I was very concerned about was the errors that I found. One listed one of the ships that took settlers to Jamestown as the Sarah Constant, while the vast majority of records call it the Susan Constant. Also, the book claims that the ""Where's the Beef!"" slogan was used by Burger King, while it was actually used by Wendy's. Granted, that's just two out of the reported 10,000, but those two I found in a quick skimming of the book, and are just ones I know of. So it doesn't exactly instill confidence in the accuracy of the other answers that I don't know."
2,Irrelevant trivia,"There is some decent (Jeopardy-style) knowledge in here, but you're going to look very hard to find it. What you will find is page after page of extremely obscure movie, TV and book trivia that is of little or no value. The authors seem to have a special obsession for Hardy Boys novels. If that's what you're after, this is your book. I would estimate that there may be one or two genuine pieces of useful trivia on each page interspersed with incessant (and very dated) pop-culture allusions."
5,So much fun!,"This is an addictive book- you cannot thumb through it without being amazed at the amount of neat facts!My husband and I (both tried out Jeopardy as teens!) took it iwith us on a car trip and read aloud from it. Where else can you find first lines of famous books, the original 31 flavors and the islands mentioned in Kokomo!I love the little bits of pop culture- I always remember that the Facts of Life girls went to Eastland, but liked being reminded that Holden Caufield was booted from Pencey Prep.This is great for a game show contest or just a trivia afficionado. The information ranges from sports to culture, music politics etc. Read it, but have lots of time because you won't be able to put it down!"
1,Not what I wanted,I thought this was a book to answer questions such as; Why is the sky blue?... just stuff like that; it's not at all like that...I found it boring and un-useable; and returned it.
5,For the insatiably curious,"More than just a list of the usual crossword puzzle answers, ""10,000 Answers: The Ultimate Trivia Encyclopedia"" will keep you lost in meaningless information, developing you as a future ""Jeopardy"" armchair champion.10,000 bits of information ought to last the particularly curious person... hmm... maybe a month? Or one very long Saturday, with a cup of coffee.Expect to be obsessed with this one.I fully recommend ""10,000 Answers : The Ultimate Trivia Encyclopedia.""Anthony Trendl"
2,Trivia buff bought this,"The book is ""OK"", some years old now and I found a couple of errors. The trivia has a lot of stuff on TV shows and movies that I have never heard of. Nonethe less it was fun looking over from my bedside stand"
3,Good Only if You Like Horowitz's Style,"I love Chopin, but I have discovered that I don't like Horowitz. I find his style choppy and abrupt, which is not how I grew up listening to Chopin. Also, I found the recording quality medicore although it is on CD, so the age of the recording shows.My guess is that if you know you already like Horowitz, then this CD is probably for you. But if you are not sure or haven't an opinon to try someone else."
4,Like new,"This CD is exactly what I wanted. It truly is in like new condition, I feel I definitely got what I paid for."
1,swtich,Hate this thing would be great if it came with all the pieces sent back for refund. Had to go to home depot to get other pieces which they only sell in a kit
3,Summary of works,"I have read a couple of Peale's works and this one seems like more of a summary than anything else. Don't get me wrong, it still purveys a powerful message of how positive living can change your life and others, but at the same time I see a lot of repetition of previously told stories from other books he wrote. This also uses a lot of ""name dropping"" which I find unecessary and boring. All in all still a very good read, but I would recommend one of his earlier works instead, perhaps ""Enthusiasm makes the difference"". One thing to remember this change if you choose to make it will not occur over night, but will take time...so don't despair."
5,The Best Pen I've Ever Used,"I love this pen. I've used several tri- and quad-point pens in the past, but the quality of this Cross pen is beyond anything I've used previously. The twist-to-switch action is smooth and solid. Little details like a rubber gasket at the base of the screw off eraser cover show the attention to detail the designers of this pen have incorporated. I've left it at home a few times and I'm lost without it. I've used mine for about 2 years, and other than some minor wear on the clip, it's as good as the day I took it out of the (very nice) box.Although I don't really anticipate this happening, if it ever breaks, I'll order a new one the same day."
3,not a big enough connector...,"The plastic connector piece was too small. So, when I went to unplug it from my computer I couldn't get my fingers on it, because it was too far into the computer. It left me with only cable to pull on to try to get it out... Which led to me breaking the cable the first time I tried to unplug the thing... I eventually had to use two jeweler screwdrivers and a pair plyers to get it out...It worked great while it was in the computer and my issue may have been computer dependent, but it would have been nice if the connector was a little longer."
4,First,"It's just like being in class with Diane, so if I miss one I can put in the DVD and then not feel guitly. It also kicks your butt just like the class. I bought 3 copies. One for me and two presents."
5,Excellent,I have had the privilege of taking Diane's classes in person for the past couple of years and love her teaching style. When I can't make it to class I pop in the DVD and let her soothing voice carry me through my yoga practice at home. Excellent DVD!
5,Yoga fan,"I have been practicing for 2 years now because of Diane and she has taken my body and practice to a whole new level. I can do balance poses that I and most people thought wasn't possible but she made it very real for me. I take her classes Tuesdays and Sundays and this video is just like her classes. I have gained a nice, toned, muscle definition with slow sundays and power yoga. The most rewarding part after doing these routines is the last relaxing pose (I can't spell it) which she also includes in this dvd. Thanks Diane for producing a video that is great for everyone."
4,Legacy recording,Poor jacket insert accompanying recording. Thought concerto was three movements. Listing on insert has it as four. Font blurry on front cover. Music is excellent.
2,Size Warning,"This adaptor is {2-1/4""OD} to 1-1/2""ODThe 'Shop-Vac' adaptor is well made.Other adpators have size errors too.Buy a bunch of diffent ones, and try them to you find the right combination."
5,Works as expected,"I bought this to connect a hose from my Ridgid radial arm saw to my dust collector. The 1 1/2"" side fits perfectly inside the blade guard dust fitting."
3,Good Fitting To Have Around,Can't say that this fitting has any specific uses but if you have a Craftsman or ShopVac it's great to have around to adapt to different tools.
4,Jazzy stuff,This is all basically the music of Bernstein's Symphonic dances condensed into one little CD. Excellent CD considering its price where many other Westside story CD's go for 30 dollars or more. A definate buy.
2,Very soft coffee,I really like strong expresso style coffee's ... this coffee is very mild.. dont get me wrong it is good coffee if you like it light.
3,OK coffee,"Perhaps i was expecting something special, or maybe I just didn't order the right bean. This coffee is perfectly OK, but no more than that. I will try a darker beam next time, I think."
4,Nice knife... little heavy,"I've had a handful of pocket knives over the years. The quality of this knife is really nice, and the blade stays nice and firm (other knives I've had to tighten up every month). It is one of the more heavier knives I've carried, so it is a little more noticeable in your pocket. I've since switched to a lighter weight Kershaw, but I keep this one in my bag."
5,Rey Mysterio,I love this because Rey Mysterio is my favorite wrestler and I love to hear about him and listen to him speak.
1,FAKE PERFUME,I just bought this perfume 1 week ago and this perfume is FAKE. I have been buying this perfume at a department store and decided to order the perfume from amazon because it was cheaper. (Note: This is my first time buying a perfume from Amazon). When I opened the package - you can already tell by the box that it was fake. The scent is not the same as well. I'm very disappointed that Amazon is selling a fake perfume to their customers. The worst part is I can't return this perfume.
2,Great perfume but unfortunately disappointing quality,"I absolutely love this perfume and was very pleased when I first got it. It came nicely packaged in the box and was on time. Unfortunately, the dispenser does not work well so I have to spray quite a lot of times to get the desired amount of perfume (I compared it to the crystalline perfumes in stores). The perfume at some point also started leaking so I'm really bummed that I got it from amazon... I would recommend getting it from a store instead of online."
1,fake parfume,This parfume is fake.The smell doesn't last even 30min.I am very disapointed.The box is fake too.Think twice before you buy it.
4,Great Frangrance!,"Great every day scent. Wear almost every day. Have gotten many compliments. Wish it lasted a little longer, but will definitely buy again."
5,great,I bought this from amazon and compared it to the one I bought from nordstroms and there is noooo difference and it doesn't smell off or rancid like some perfumes that you buy from discount stores. I am so happy I tried it here and I won't be paying almost double elsewhere. I love the scent and it lasts long too. Thank you amazon:)
5,opinion on this product,"Good morning, regarding this product thoroughly recommend it because it is a very good perfume, the size is the same as shown on the page and original."
2,Disappears on me,"When I ran out of Sung's Shi, I replaced it with Omnia Crystalline. The choice was pretty easy for me -- I enjoy Omnia (original), I appreciate Alberto Morillas, and the deal was too good to pass up (about 20 bucks for 2.2oz).Crystalline & Shi are similar - clear, clean, watery, soft florals that stay close to the skin. However, Crystalline is done much better than Shi, in my opinion.Last summer I went through a bottle of Crystalline in less than 2 months because I continually applied it. I really loved the notes and development, and I appreciated it more each time I wore it. But it was an EDT. I want (and need) something with more projection, a quality that neither Shi or Crystalline has.Crystalline isn't a go-to, everyday fragrance for me. In fact, I think this whole class of aquatic fragrance isn't for me, but Crystalline is among the best of its class."
5,Best Price,This is one of my all time favorite fragrances and I've never seen it for such a great price. I love AMAZON!!!
1,bad product,"Very dissapointed, it's like water, would not pay even a penny. It's a big lie to customers. I can't believe Amazon is part of it."
4,Best wedding anniversary ever!,I knew my wife loved this perfume but it was so difficult to find here in Venezuela. So I looked it up here and gave a very nice surprise to my wife on our 8th anniversary this week. She was so happy then and still thanks me every morning before leaving to work!
4,Interesting Primer and an interesting read,"Written before the days of day traders and E*Trade, this book provides advice and opinions that are still right on the money. Schwab has produced a down-to-earth, easy to read book that ranges over a wide variety of investments.Schwab also gives some insight into some of the legal and financial battles that he endured along the way.An interesting read."
5,Amazing for brittles nails and dry cuticles!,"I have the typical sensitive skin. My nails are often dry and chip/flake, and I get the skin around my cuticles peel off a lot.Several months ago, I got the lemon butter cuticle cream in a starter pack for my birthday, and once I tried it, I was hooked!My nails and cuticles are so much softer and more supple now! I don't have to worry about my nails constantly breaking or having hangnails. It's really not greasy, it absorbs quickly and smells great. I noticed a great deal of improvement after only a couple days of using it - I've ordered it online several times since then!"
3,Not up to her 2 previous books,"I absolutely LOVED her first 2 books in this series, HeartMate and Heart Thief, but this book annoyed me. The main characters, HollyHeir Holm and Healer Lark, spend the whole book having the same basic conversation over and over again. Noone learns from their mistakes, even with a great oracle (Vinni, a very interesting little boy) helping them. I liked Holm in previous books, but found him unsympathic in this book. I wished for old characters to show more often, just to relieve the boredom. The ending was VERY disappointing. I will continue to buy her books, having loved the first 2 so much, but pray they live up to the first ones."
4,Magic Slim & The Teardrops 44 Blues,This is one of the Best CD's by my favorite Blues Artist Magic Slim! This one will keep your feet moving throughout the entire CD! Electric Chicago Style Blues at it's best. This CD features parts of 3 Live Performances by Slim and the Teardrops while they were overseas. Sound quality is very good also! Highly recommend this one to any Magic Slim fan. And if you have never heard Slim before you're in for a real treat!
5,sweet,how can you go wrong with ronnie milsap....i swear if i was just listening to the cd from another room i would swear they took his vocals out of the original recording....nicely done
1,Broke the first time I used it.,"Broke the first time I used it. Little plastic bit broke off the spool, so it wouldn't retract fully any more. Cheap build quality. Would not recommend."
4,unreadable but pictures are quite useful,"Perfect Anatomy Charts (each sells for ~$5 and you can have this sweet deal ""all in one book 35 charts/~$10""however beware of ridiculously small tags and descriptions!!! unreadable :(for the price it can be helpful tool for anatomy students, they can even turn it into activity book - cut of the pictures and make their own charts - great exercise to review the whole systems of the human body.overall worth the price but it could be really so much better."
5,Hidden Gem,"This is such a wonderful film - sweet, honest, funny and engaging - it's easy to watch and highly enjoyable. Definitely NOT a typical cheese-ball romantic comedy with a predictable, boring ending. I found so many moments to be real and easy to relate to. The acting is great, it's beautifully shot and well composed. Highly recommend!"
3,Beautiful but flawed patterns,"I love all the beautiful patterns in this book. They are all very unique and different from any other knitting patterns I have ever seen. My only problem with this book is that while most of the directions seem correct, you will get to the end of knitting a piece and realize that part of the directions were omitted and the piece you knit does not match the piece in the book. I have been knitting for several years and have made two sweaters from this book so far and each one I was in for a horrible surprise when I finished. The problems are easily fixable for the frequent knitter but it is very frustrating to have to rip out half of your work to fix the problem."
5,"Very vintage, very British, very nice","This book is lovely to look at. I haven't knitted up anything yet so I cannot comment on how well written are the pattern. But as far as I can see, the book is a good keep if you are a Rowan-style fashion fan. It is nice even just to look at it without knitting anything (just yet). With all the big designer names, it can't be wrong. One more good thing about this pattern book is that, the FO are shown by real modern time models. It might come to a surprise to you, but there are many pattern books out there just put the original picture from the original pattern. Very difficult to imagine how it is like on real modern time body."
4,Cool cool.,"As a female, I must say that most of the patterns in this book were very neat. I think they were all rather flattering, and the way the pictures were set up was very attractive, as was the male model (My sister calls him Jamie. [Don't be alarmed, we name all the people in pattern books and magazines. The dark haired girl is Madeline, and the blonde is Krista.]) Anyway, this book is gorgeous, and the only complaint I have is that some of the charts are hard to read. It would have three stars if it weren't for Jamie."
4,"Excellent Trio Style. Not the best, but still Great!","Some Standards, some new songs. A Great CD TO own. Pay Metheny is terrific, anytime, anywhere! T.Stamos"
4,The jazzier Methany,"Given the range of his albums, a naiive listener might be forgiven for thinking that there were two Pat Methanys. One is the repetitive Methany who makes elevator disco with his large group, and the other is the brilliant melodic guitarist who records with Charlie Haden and other jazz masters. This is definitely the latter Mathany. Not quite up there with ""Beyond the Missouri Sky"", but an excellent album nonetheless."
2,Is it me?,"Self-indulgent, inaccessible, hard to listen to. Or is it just me? I saw the trio live in Kendal, but for me bring back Lyle and the Group. I understand that the greatest musicians in the world (Pat being among them), need to do stuff like this evey now and again to get it out of the system. This is one Pat album I'm giving a miss tho'."
5,He just gets better,"These discussions about ranking Pat's albums are sort of absurd. He's the best modern musician who happens to play the guitar, and every recording has something to offer. Where everybody else plows through changes, Pat floats, and the trio frees him up even more."
5,Indispensible!,"I've never been a big Metheny fan. My tastes in jazz guitar run from Django through Joe Pass to Jim Hall, John Abercrombie and John Scofield. Metheny always seemed a bit new-agey/electronic, but this single disk puts him, for me, in the top rank. The collaboration with Hall seems to have done its job; the influence is obvious. Some of the phrases and harmonic turns would have astonished Charlie Parker! Don't miss it."
2,Competently looking backwards,"2 1/2Fans of his straightforward post-bop approach might relish this, while fans of an ambitiously adventurous side may not. It's hard to call anything this masterful guitarist does uneventful- sheer technical mastery alone makes that impossible- but next to most modern Metheny stimuli this rests with the most relatively mediocre."
4,"much to enjoy, but a bit uneven","Pat Metheny is the best in my book, but this disc is not quite up to the simple beauty of Missouri Sky or the haunting and evocative recordings with the Pat Metheny Group (Offramp is still my favorite). The reworking of Lone Jack is great and Travels is quite beautiful. Some of the other pieces are less accessible to a non-musician, non-jazz aficianado like me."
3,Best taken in small doses,"""Dissapointing"" [sic] had it about right -- this trio date takes a clear third place behind Q&A and Rejoicing, primarily because there just isn't the extraordinary telepathy that PM gets with Haynes, Holland, Higgins or Haden. Grenadier and Steward are first rate, but those other guys are beyond rating. Also, the date just doesn't feature as many killer compositions (e.g., Question & Answer, Change of Heart, The Calling) -- and half of Pat's greatness is his composing. It's still worth buying -- the way he frolics over the mind-bending changes of Giant Steps is astonishing, and Lone Jack makes a welcome reappearance after 21 years. But take it bit-by-bit; there's a kind of sameness otherwise."
4,"Highs and Lows, But the Lows Are High","Pat Metheny creates some of the most complex and rapid-fire guitar improvisations the human ear can digest. And he can play soft and slow, with unerring feel. This album mixes both types of songs. The result is not quite the the sheer beauty of Missouri Sky, but it is much richer and more rewarding than lots of Pat Metheny Group compositions. I hear new things every time I listen to this album, and I think I am likely to hear new things for many more listens. Some songs are more appealing than others (isn't this true for most albums?) but even the less appealing songs are worth listening to and pondering. Pat Metheny is a world-class musician."
4,Acoustic Travels,"From a big Metheny fan I am pleased with this release. A strong jazz recording that flows well from song to song. It ends with a beautiful acoustic version of "" Travels "" that will transport you to another demension of time and space."
3,A little too straight ahead for my taste,"This albulm is not bad at all, it's just that I've come to expect ""less standard stuff"" from Pat Metheny and his 32 string guitar. I really dug Imaginary Day and some of his other albulms that were a little more fusiony and experimental. To me, this trio albulm is almost too cliched, a little too standard. Some of the tracks sounded a little bare, and all the songs in the albulm sounded too similar because of the instrumentation and song selection. Methany did a terrific job within this restrictive framework: some of his solos were outstanding, but this isn't the kind of albulm I was expecting it to be."
5,ooooooo la la,"If you enjoyed Pat's meeting with Roy Haynes and Dave Holland GET THIS DISC! If you enjoy the playing style of Steve Kimock, get this disc! Incredible improvisation throughout, including several slower acoustic compositions wich are simply beautiful."
1,Mighty Bright Classic Sight Reader Stand Light,"This product was not very durable, hard to adjust, and not very bright. I would not recommend it. I have since bought the double LCD clip on light and love it!"
5,one of my favorites,"I love the size, weight and look of these earrings. The sale price (60% off) was just icing on the cake. I think they are too dressy for everyday, but when I do wear them, I just feel a little more elegant."
4,Mice Parade,"Adam Pierce has so much truth written in his music. It is truly ""art music"" in the popular genre because he writes to write, not to make millions. His evolution in the performing arts has been interesting to watch and hear. He really cares about the world of music."
1,Italian for Kids vol 1,I received this as a new copy and the CD does not work. There is no address or number to contact about the problem. I am now stuck with a product I can't use.
2,not overly impressed,"the words learned in this volume are pretty basic. there were not too many words either.my 5 year old, who loves to watch tv did not really get into this at all.I don't think I would recommend to others."
2,There are better DVDs out there!,This video is pretty painful to watch! Not worth the money. Try Little Pim or watching Italian youtube videos instead.
3,Italian American Video for Kids,My kids love to watch the video and ask me to play it over and over for them. What I don't particularly like about this video is that it doesn't have native Italian speakers. It uses Italian american kids that speak Italian.
3,Italian for kids: Learn Italian beginner Level 1vol1,It was a nice basic video. A little too short. I wish it was done with cartoon characters because it will keep children 5 and older interest better.
1,What happened to proper Italian pronounciation?,"Definitely do not recommend if you are looking to teach proper Italian cadence to your kids, which is something I believe in being native Italian and having founded my own company ([...]) as a result of the fact that real Itlian words are very often americanized or mispronounced.The actress is definitely not Italian and has an extremely poor pronounciation."
1,Not Native Speakers,"I was disappointed (and embarrassed) when my Italian husband came home to hear this dvd playing and said, ""those aren't native speakers, they sound Spanish"". He wasn't upset, but I have read in several places for babies it's important to learn with a native accent. He speaks with my husband (native) and this is how I want him to hear the Italian in the dvds. And what actually does make me mad is on the dvd is claims to have native speakers. Most Americans would never know, not very ethical.My two year old loves the songs, but it's also very annoying and not practical that the learning quiz sections stop the dvd so I have to come in and skip them one by one for my two year old. I tried to find a option to play the dvd without the quiz sections, can't find anything that works.It's next to impossible to find real Italian dvds here in the states, so I've decided to have my mother in law in Italy send us some."
1,Disappointed,"I had high expectations after reading the description of this video. Not only was the content too short(not enough value for the money I paid),but the quizzes throughout did not seem necessary (I thought). In addition,there was a young boy in the video who had the worst pronunciation (ie. ""verde""). It was pretty obvious that not all the characters are fluent speakers. That dog seemed strange and unnecessary to the story. I think if the story was told in Italian only (with subtitles) it would be a more effective tool for teaching young children the Italian language."
3,too much too fast,"This book is stronger than tranquilizers if you have trouble sleeping! But that aside, it plows right into discussion without establishing a strong base for new concepts. What descriptions are given feel too abstract to be useful (based on having a teacher later explain and clarify). Many vocabulary terms aren't defined, but rather used in an example. If you don't know the word's meaning to start with, the example is useless. Thank goodness for the glossary, but why should the reader have to spend the entire time flipping back and forth? I don't have any experience with another text, but I feel that this isn't a great book for someone just getting seriously into research. As a graduate student with a strong nursing background, I still found this book very hard to wade through."
1,You get what you pay for.,"Ok product if only occationally used, but after about two years of usage on normal service on three vehicles, the seals had to be replaced as it would not lift even my wife's Pilot much less my trucks. Internal machining marks are too coarse to keep the seals in good shape for long."
1,DO NOT BUY,The first kick broke the net.We emailed the people and still haven't gotten a reply.They only gave us a vague picture of the cage for our directions and while assembling the screws were too short except for four.Also they had holes screwed into the wrong places.There is also so much of an excess of net it takes 3 minutes to get the ball out if your lucky.
4,An exploration of friendship,"While on vacation in Cancun, Derek, a gay black man with HIV, befriends two teenaged straight white boys. The story centers on the building of the friendship between them, with Derek's coming out to them as gay and as HIV+ and with Derek's intense attraction to one of the two boys. Boyd eloquently portrays the struggles of Derek coming to terms with his unrequited desire for the oldest boy, and the sometimes wavering effects of time and distance on a friendship. He does succumb to gooey sentimentality towards the end, but it doesn't take away from the grace of the novel."
2,Overrated album,"I like ""The light"" in fact, I gave it five stars. ""The window of Life"" is very good also, I gave it 4 stars. ""The jewel"" is far below these two albums. Listen to it again and see what I mean....bad sound, poor musical transitions, it really looks like a small garage band.Pendragon can do better and they did with the following albums.I'll give my cd to a friend of mine because I won't listen to it anymore."
3,Not light reading,"I was assigned this book as part of a French Fiction in Film class at IUPUI back in 1994 (read the books, write the papers, then--maybe--watch the movie). The version I read was the original French, but later I read the translation. This book is, by no means, a light reader for a Sunday afternoon. The themes are complicated, the vocabulary is archaic, and the general feeling after reading is not a happy one. Still, it's a good book. Some other readers have referred to it as a work of art, but I wouldn't quite go THAT far. If you're not quite up on your 19th century mining lingo, you might want to get a primer before reading this book. The central themes about human nature and desire are fairly accurate, if somewhat French (by this I mean, ""Oh, what a deezaster our lives are! how shall we ever overcome zees traaagedy...I'VE GOT IT, FRANCOIS! National Socialism!). Other than these minor issues, a good book."
5,A Masterpiece,"What I think will hold back many currently fashionable writers from having their books survive as masterpieces is their smallness, their inability to honor the greatness of the human condition. You can't get there with contempt, disdain and loathing, no matter how entertaining and enthralling the smirking can be. Zola was the original ""New Journalism,"" but he did it with sincere, heartfelt, compassion, and, in Germinal, he created an extraordinarily propulsive social work that also ushered in the modern disaster novel. That's it's also a page turner only makes it better. It's one of a handful of books I read and re-read. It's not just a classic, it's a Masterpiece."
4,Ultimately satisfying,"Unfortunately, Zola's Germinal initially came across as contrived to me. Clearly, he spent a lot of time in the mines and with the miners, but his recall of details--at least initially--felt like a third person accounting/reportage. This is in contrast to the authenticism of someone like D.H. Lawrence, who knew intimately the life of a miner, and whose depiction of that life seems more effortless. The novel ultimately becomes satisfying, however, as we get to know Etienne and his comrades, and hope for their success in their revolt against the shareholders of the mines."
1,Really bad *AVOID*,This router overheats everyday and twice on Saturday. Requires constant reseting. If you want a router that you have to mess with every time you want to get on the internet buy this one. If you want a router that WORKS I suggest you keep looking and buy a different one.
4,My very first Harlequin book ever,"This was my very first harlequin book ever and I loved it, I loved it so much that I currently own 25. Considering the fact that I read it in July its pretty good. This story is about a woman Kate who left her husband Nicolas because she believed that he married her out of duty and because there were rumors that he was seeing another woman. Fate brings them back together when Kate's sister Rebbecca gets herself into trouble and calls Nic to bail her out. This is a beautiful story about second chances and righting all wrongs. I would so recommend it to other readers."
5,Best of Chick Lit!,"I've read a lot of ""Chick Lit"" relationship books but I really dug ""Don't Help a Man be a Man"" because the awesome personal stories were so easy to relate to."
3,Easier than it looks,"While this puzzle was fun for a few hours, it soon wore off, as it is a very easy puzzle to solve. This would probably be the right difficulty for younger puzzle solvers, but for anyone who regularly solves Rubik's cubes or other spatial/sequential puzzles, this is too simple."
4,"Good product, fast shipment","This game is intersting just like the rubik cube.... in fact, it's little bit harder than the rubik cube... but good to increase your personal skills...It was intersting and the shipment was fast....Thanks :)"
3,TOO MUCH INFO,This book had more information that I needed to create a website. I wanted the basics and it gave me much more.
2,Confused,"I thought the depth adjustment would work better. It can't be adjusted close enough to set the screw head flush with surface. The adjustment is only good at about 1/4"" below surface, or deeper. Why can't anyone make a countersink with a descent depth stop?"
3,Leicester Bangs Review (2007):,"Anti Atlas - Between Two (Tangled Up / One Little Indian)Anti Atlas is the collaboration of composer Ned Bigham and producer Chris Hufford, who between them can provide a CV of heroic and extreme proportions - possibly trivial details include producing early Radiohead tracks, composing brass fanfares for cathedrals and drumming for Neneh Cherry - you get the picture.Described as classical meets electronica, ""Between Two"" is a gallant attempt to marry two theoretically disparate genres, which works remarkably well in practice, though doesn't deliver much in the way of genuine excitement. Strings and gentle beats seem to be prevalent, and while they're obviously following in the footsteps of innovators like Eno and Gavin Bryars, ""Between Two"" doesn't have quite the same magic as the former's ""Discreet Music""."
1,Poorly made watch,We bought this watch and within 2 days the winder fell off. Exchanged it for the same watch and within 24 hours the winder fell off the new one as well. We are taking it back for a refund this time. I do not recommend this watch as much as my son liked the look of it.
1,Looks great - doesn't last,"We bought this for our son's 7th birthday, and it lasted approximately one month. It is not suitable for swimming - I think that's what did it in."
4,Poorly Written But a Helpful Study Tool,"I found these books very irritating, because I am a very linear thinker and they are organized very poorly. If you can get past how poorly written they are, this is a helpful resource for studying for the PHR test. However, I suggest using it with at least one other resource. If you are just wanting to learn about HR, there are other introductions to HR that are better written and say just as much in about 1/4 the space. If you are looking for resources to help you as a practicing HR professional, look for some topical resources that go into greater detail."
4,Not sure why this one is ignored,"In 1957 Ms. Vaughan recorded an album at Chicago's ""Mr Kelly's."" It has been regarded as one of Vaughan's best live performances. ""After Hours at the London House"" is the follow-up to that album. The London House was a popular night club at the corner of Wacker and Michagn Ave in Chicago. Now a Burger King (alas!), Oscar Peterson recorded a live album there also. Ms. Vaughan's London House date was recorded the same night after she did two shows at Mr Kelly's. She clearly is tired (that is very clear at the end of the CD) but there is a very cool late night, low enegry vibe to the affair. The recording quality is great, especially on Vaughan's voice. She is backed by a quartet that includes trumpeter Thad Jones.If you liked Vaughan at Mr Kelly's you should grab this CD. At the rate that back catalog is going away, I wouldn't wait too long."
3,ANY PARENT WITH AN AUTISTIC CHILD NEEDS TO READ,"A LITTLE OUTDATED, BUT AS A PARENT WITH A NEWLY DIAGNOSED AUTISTIC CHILD, I NEEDED, FOR MY OWN BENEFIT, TO READ ANYTHING I COULD MY HANDS ON. THIS BOOK HAS THE BASICS COVERED FOR DEALING WITH AND LOVING YOUR AUTISTIC CHILD."
4,Very pretty!,This standard size Breyer horse did not look that great in the picture. We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was quite nice when we opened the box. It has a nice size and detailing. Colors are crisp and is not as awkward as it looked in its picture.
5,My Favorite,"This is my absolute favorite Breyer horse (the next closest contender is Cigar). The detail in the mane and tail braids is exceptional, and on my model, the hooves were detailed - the frog sculpted, that is, as well as the general shape of the bottom of the hoof. I was amazed at this. The color is another major plus. The deep deep brown is just gorgeous contrasted next to the nice white.This is not a child's toy, unless you want a broken-legged expensive horse sadly sitting on the shelf. ;)"
1,Bad call for Amazon.,"Pads did not fit, watch out when selecting you vehicle on Amazon for parts finder. I was WAY off for my Camry."
4,Variable stars,"OK ""classical"" music is a STYLE that existed hundreds of years ago. The reason this is referred to as classical is that the instumentation is acoustic and are generally the kind used by symphonic or chamber musicians. There is no REAL thing that is classical music. Any true music is one of a kind.However:If you like modernist acoustic music played by disciplined technical virtuosos, you know that Frank Zappa type thing, you'll probably like this a lot.If you are more inclined towards traditionally ""classical"" this is probably not going to be your cup of tea.If you are more interested in composition rather than virtuosity this is probably not going to ring your bell.If you are looking for something swinging that has no description this is probably not going to do it for you, except for the Conlon Nancarrow, which is a stone groove and probably worth the price of admission."
5,A wonderful romantic fantasy!,"Ms. Welsh is a captivating writer, who takes us into her fantasy world and makes us believe in it. Can't wait for part 2 of this wonderful trilogy!"
1,"Ugh, what a waste of money","Why did I waste my money on this?? The CD-ROM didn't really work right, and when I did get it to work, the book was horrible. The writing was very poor, there was no character development, and I couldn't even get past the half way point. Please don't waste your money too!!"
5,A wonderful performance,"[....] I have this disc as well as Mutter's 1981 disc. Mutter's performance sounds quite mechanical compared to Lin's. Both disc are digital recording, but to my ears, this one is a clear winner."
3,Not What I expected,"If you are expecting straight ahead jazz, the likes of which Binney has recorded for Criss Cross, this ain't it! Too abstract for my taste.Being a fan of modern NYC style jazz, I was very disappointed in this outing. Binney has a new release on Criss Cross which I will definately purchase."
4,Is your high school what it seems?,"Alot has been written about high school and teenagers. However this book takes the reader into the thoughts that many boys have of high school. What student hasn't had the thought ""this isn't real"" when faced with the social and moral demands placed on them by their peers? Dragonology, by Justin Thorne takes the step addressing the moral and social lessons taught by parents and the reality of being thrust into the society of high school where these lessons don't apply.A good read for parents and teenagers alike."
4,flattering pant,"this is a great boot cut tight. Fits well for women with curves. Washes and dries well on low. The fabric does not seem to pill. I am 5'8"" and it is a little long, so short people will have to hem."
4,Great Float,"A friend had one of these floats that I tried and it was the best float ever! It doesn't tip over and allows you to be partly in the water so you stay cool while suntanning. READ the directions as without that it is almost impossible to fold back up and could break. Also, to have it as full of air as needed to float high in the water, you need to follow the directions carefully. I am a snowbird and ordered 8 more for others who live in my RV park. They love them also!!! And did I mention comfort? WOW~SuZ~"
4,Wait to buy,I bought this float on amazon because I read somewhere that it was only available on-line @ Target. NOT TRUE. I bought it and then 2 days later I saw it at my local Target and for only 16.99. BUT later in the season the stores probably sell out.Haven't used it yet. Still had to rate it though.
3,it could be a great book,"It is a beautiful book with very interesting informations. I liked to know the history of many plants, but the autor doesnt't know almost anything about South American flowers. All the flora of Atlantic forest was forgotten.There is almost nothing about the great family of blomeliads and orchids. It could be a great book. . There is a book written by Loerenzi de Souza who has a great knowledge about brasilian flora, Harri Lorenzi (plantarum@plantarum.com. br) that could help the next edition."
3,A Basic Survey of Project Control Methods and Facts,"This ""book,"" is really a collection of articles with a supply of facts based from various studies on the topic of project control, and highly referenced. This collection approach jumps around and the book, in my opinion, suffers a little from the perspective of cohesion. I would prefer a more original work with the author(s) adding their own insights to the topic. That assessment is subjective though. The reality is there are some great gems in the book, gems so useful that I found myself taking select notes from a few parts in the book on items that I can use week-to-week to better control projects. Most of the articles are suited to a more experienced crowd though and so I do not believe novices will reap as much from the collection."
3,The first book in an always enjoyable series - 3.5 stars,"This is the first story of Earl Dumarest. He is a hardened and tough space traveler, who is also compassionate when necessary. He stowed away on a merchant ship as a child, and left Earth toward the center of the galaxy. He survives with grit and his knife fighting skills, which he uses for arena fights on various worlds. This provides him with money to continue to travel, in search of an Earth which has become mythic to other worlds so far away. He constantly searches for clues to his lost home world, while dodging the mysterious Cyclan, a race of cyborgs with dreams of ruling the galaxy. Any of these books can be read as stand-alone novels, as each has no connection to previous adventures. Dumarest's plight is summarized in each book. All are entertaining and competently written, and this first one is no exception."
3,Precursory Overview,I found this book to present a brief overview of the rather large field of Optics. Derivations of many of the equations are omitted and some rather abstract areas are not expounded upon. However as a fast reading overview of the major areas of optics this book provides a good introduction or review.
1,Very poor text,"Just finishing up a semester-long, junior-level optics course using this book. It is absolutely horrid. The students often find the exposition incomprehensible (as do I). The authors frequently pull results out of thin air when a few lines of derivation/explanation would have made things clear. The problem sets are generally useless as they are routinely too difficult or too easy. The choice of topics is over-reaching. Care should be taken with fundamentals, then applications and variations on a theme can be introduced. This book makes the fundamentals a mystery, then piles on one topic after another before the end of the chapter. I can't think of anything good to say about this book. No real online support. Even the diagrams are frequently a head-scratching affair. It should be discontinued. What garbage. I wish my students could get their money back."
1,A waste of time,"This DVD is a complete waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip this title. There is nothing here worth your time. Perhaps if this DVD sells poorly enough, Playboy will get the message and start producing better quality DVD's."
1,bad,when i got this movie player i thought it was not going to work good becuse of the low price so i got it and i got it used becuse it was so cheap i shouldnt have done that the ups guy game me the package and i went in side and opened it so after that i put a movie in and it said on it movie loading on it all a son the screen tured black and started to flash made s loud noise and it died so that is why i should have not got the used one becuse it wasnt that good
2,Good when it works,"We have had for 9 months and it has worked good up until now. We have not even used the player that much and now there is a loose connection somehwere between the screen and the player. It has been taken well care of and has not been exposed to anything harmful whatsoever. We cannot open the screen past 90 dgrees or the screen will blank out...sound still works for what its worth since the volume is a big weakness. Regardless of where you may read about a year warranty, there is only a 90 day warranty on these and customer service can be difficult to locate. Astar has offred to fix for a $35 fee, but I would rather spend that money on a brand we can trust. I would spend your money on a different brand altogether."
5,Great DVD Player,"I have used this DVD player for a few years now, and it still works wonderfully. The buttons are well labeled on the player. The DVD's speakers are not very loud; thus, it is helpful to use a headset. The screen is not powerful under the sun, but I haven't seen any electronics that has a powerful screen under this particular condition. I use the player to connect to the TV sometimes, and the effort to connect the player to the TV is minimal. I like the remote that comes with the player when I am using it with the TV. I have not encountered any major problems with the player, and I would recommend this player to anyone."
2,Nothing Special,"I auditioned these speakers in my home for about a month. These speakers while detailed, sounded cold, and lacked musicality. I have liked ever other speaker I have auditioned better than these; Monitor Audio Gold, Usher S520, Audioengine A5, and Audioengine A2. The only reason I am giving them 2 stars rather than 1 is that I have read that these need a separate amp to reach their full potential, I used only a 90 watt/channel Denon receiver."
1,Yuk,Ronald Reagan would turn over in his grave if he had to eat Jelly Bellies. I got these for a gift. Each to their own.
2,BAD,"I'd expect Barrons of all books to be perfect. Not the case with this one. LOTS of mistakes. (For example, said hydrogen bonding was very weak) Does not go over the material thoroughly enough. Get the new Kaplan one."
2,Not Worth it,"I paid about $12.00 for this book. But when I started doing some exercises in the book, I found out a few mistakes. I was confused. It did not help me a lot. I was not sure if it was the real Barron's book.I appreciated the fast shipping."
1,The goofy woofy,Sorrt dood but the cd was not in particularly good. Its got to go bye bye honey. Hey its your money...Get more for it.
4,Brings you to the beach...,"I have not yet been afforded the movie, so I found 'The Beach' soundtrack...I am so glad I did. This music is a wonderful compilation of music and song that is, believably enough, relaxing. There are 4 songs that I skip over, for they annoy me. If you want to feel the water without being in it, open your mind and listen. Hope you enjoy this one...it's worth it."
3,A few jewels in this CD,"I am a person who likes anything from Laureena McKinnett to Missy Elliot, just to give you a standard of my review. THE BEACH starts out with an amazing Leftfield production ""SnakeBlood"" as a matter of fact that would be my favourite song on the CD. Then from there it goes down hill. My list would be No.1, No.10, No.9 (OK remix of the early 90s song Yeke Yeke), No.3 and then the rest are just there. If you like House Euro mix with an alternative twist you would like this CD. If I had the option to but this CD again I would definitly consider it but still might leave the store without it and wait until I find it much cheaper Like years later in a garage sale perahps."
5,This is real good!,"I have not seen the movie yet, It's not come out yet in my country (Cyprus). I have seen some trailers to the movie and I was impressed by the music used in the trailers, so I bought me this CD. Well, this is very good! There is not even one bad title on it. Most of all I like ""Ball"" by Underworld. The rest is also very good. So, people, go to amazon.com and buy this! Now I can't wait to purchase the movie on DVD!"
3,"good flick, complimentable soundtrack","Moby' Porcelain is a wonderful piece and was the song that sold me on the album. Another good song was Voices by Dario. I would recommend this to anyone who is into dance music with an enchanting style to it. It may take some getting used to, but honestly I thought most of the songs fit well with the flick. New Order impressed me with their song Brutal found near the end of the soundtrack."
5,"The Beach: A ""paradise"" in itself","I have to confess, I saw the movie because I am a die hard Leo fan, and anything dealing with Thailand AND Leo is just my idea of...well, anything. I fell in love with the movie, the soundtrack, and the book. I mainly bought the soundtrack because I liked the movie, and the song ""Pure Shores"" by All Saints drew me in first. Slowly but surely, I fell in love with almost every other song on the entire CD, sliding ""The Beach"" into a permanent place in my CD player. Unkle's ""Lonely Souls"" especially is something I suprisingly enjoy. I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes a change from everyday music on the radio. From Mory Kante, to Sugar Ray, this CD has more than enough to offer."
3,Beach Trailer Song,"For those of you looking for the song used in the trailer for the Beach but found out it wasn't on the soundtrack, it's called ""Touched"" by a group called Vast. It's a great song, it was used recently in an episode of ""Angel."" It's standard practice to use different music in movie trailers because at the time of the trailer's release the film's soundtrack is usually not finalized. Hope this helps.Later."
4,The best film soundtrack ever!,"I actually bought this before I saw the film and I've been playing it ever since. It's got everything you could possibly want, from lazing-on-the-sand tunes (Pure Shores) to delicate piano-led gear (Porcelain) to sunset theme songs (Spinning Away). Faithless's Woozy spaces you out, while Leftfield's Snakeblood is a powerful opener. My overall favourite, though, is New Order's Brutal, the title of which pretty much describes the caning I've been (and still am) giving it. Tracks 8 and 11 are well dodgy but overall, this CD is absolutely top - get it even if you're not interested in the film. By the way, this would've got five stars but it lost one for not including one of the best tracks ever made: Out Of Control. Why wasn't it on here?"
4,songs in trailer,the song in most of the trailers is 'porcelain' by moby...you can hear a sample of it if you go to his latest cd
3,The song not on this CD,"OK CD but I bought this CD looking for the song from the trailer for this movie and it is not there.The song is ""Touched"" by ""Vast"" from their first CD ""Visual Audio Sensory Theater"". It took me forever to figure that out so I hope I can save you the time if you are looking."
5,Hanging @ The Beach or Driving In Your Car,"I purchased this CD on a hunch and it was a smart risk. It was just the type of CD I was looking for. It is a great collection of music for all occasions. I pop it in while driving my car or just cooking dinner. The music has a club techno feel throughout, with maybe the exception of the more radio appropriate tunes of Sugar Ray and All Saints. For me the highlights of this collection are from Moby & Blur. Both songs are unlike anything you will find on the average movie soundtrack. This CD is well worth the money."
3,The trailer is deceiving,"The disc isn't too bad overall, but they left the best song off the sountrack. The song on the trailer that everyone is asking about is ""Touched"" by VAST; Don't be fooled into buying the soundtrack looking for that song."
5,The Beach,"The name of one of the songs is ""Touched"" By VAST. This CD looks great I cannot wait to pick it up, I love New Order and it's their first one in years! Moby's song is gonna rock! Loved the book, loved TRAINSPOTTING, this movie is gonna kick!"
4,THE SONG FROM THE TRAILER IS NOT HERE,"THE SONG ( I FORGET THE NAME) IS BY A GROUP CALLED VAST. IT MAY BE V.A.S.T. ON THE LINER NOTES OF THEIR DISC IT SAYS IT STANDS FOR VISUAL AUDIO SENSORY THEATER. I ABOUT FREAKED WHEN I HEARD THE SONG, AND THEN SAW IT WASNT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, SINCE THEY ARE USING IT SO MUCH IN THE TRAILER."
5,Seemed like an upbeat tropical Fight Club soundtrack,"It sounded kind of techno but not too strong or weird, and I enjoyed the song by Sugar Ray a lot. It sounds like it'll be good music for the movie. One problem though, where are the two alternative-like songs from the movie trailer? Would some one please tell me what they are? Who they are by? I loved those songs!"
5,Second to last song is...,"Its track 4 on the film soundtrack, by Dario G featuring Vanessa Quinones called Voices."
3,I need to know the song from the trailer!,"Does anyone know the name of the purely instrumental song they have in the trailer? It's right after they guess the distances to the island, and then they jump into the water. I don't really know how to describe it, but it doesn't have any lyrics or anything. There is also this sort of weird sound that comes in sporadically. It also appears in a black-and-white commercial I saw on TV where this girl opens the door and this bald black guy is standing there with the rain pouring down on him. But I don't know what it was advertising!P.S. Oh, I just found it! For anyone else looking for this song, it is ""Porcelain"" by Moby (on the soundtrack). Hope this helps!"
5,"feel the Beach,...","Liked it when i first heard it during the movie... i was damn mesmerized.... Wow!. Cool man!.... u can almost feel the beach.. feel how u can really feel when u go to the Beach,... feel a certain calmness in you..."
3,That song in the first trailer,"The song that ran with The Beach's first trailer was 'Touched' by V.A.S.T. A shame that it's not on the soundtrack album, but I suspect that's because it's not in the actual film."
3,I found the song,"The CD is great, and I foudn the song from the trailer... It is called ""Touched"" from someone named Jon Crosby off a really cool CD called VAST. Hope yall can find it"
4,Smooth and Groovin',"This CD provides the perfect blend of moody techno, trip-hop, and upbeat dance tunes. Perfect for that reflective moody, cleaning mood, loving mood, whatever mood. I really like the All Saints and Sugar Ray tunes. They bring perfect balance to the CD in general. I bought it to try something different and recommend you give it a shot if you're looking for the same."
1,Jazz Muzak,"I dearly love jazz guitar and I also dearly love the ballad format, so I eagerly plunked down the money and ordered this album. I put it in the car for a long trip, but could hardly get to the end of it it was so deadly boring. It seems Malone is more interested in doodling and making a few pretty noises than he is in performing cohesive songs. This is the kind of stuff that gives many daytime FM stations a bad name. There is a lot of great stuff out there when it comes to jazz guitar, but this sure doesn't sound like any of it to me."
5,Just right for late nights,"Malone conjures a series of relaxing jazz tunes. I tend to play this album late at night whilst busy doing some other chores! Malone is good company - very smooth, and reminiscent of Charlie Haden & Pat Metheny in 'beyond the Missouri Sky'. Enjoyable album!"
1,Finickey at best,The mic was finicky at best half the time it would not detect the mic if it was plugged into the headset; yes the mic was separate and supposedly worked by plugging it into a jack in the headphones. Well that didn't work half the time so you really had to plug the mic boom straight into the mic jack on your computer. DD NOT GET THIS MIC!
2,"Awkward fit, but works","I don't know why others had problems with the microphone. Mine works and it uses the standard two 3.5 mm jacks. One for headset speakers, the other for microphone. Sound is good on both, but the problem is the microphone boom is short. This headset is designed to be tilted slightly back for it to align properly, but that isn't too comfortable or intuitive. I recommend one of the other CyberAcoustic models."
3,"""PRINCE OF THE MISTS""--SUPERB; THE REST--NOT SO MUCH","The first 15 tracks on this release constitute an ""overture,"" termed ""Prince of the Mists,"" which purports to relate ""the story in music of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the 1745 Rebellion."" Never mind that, though: the whole, comprising the noted 15 tracks (and about 19 minutes), is a marvelous piece of music and music-making. Recorded live (somewhere; though you'd never know it, until the concluding, well-earned applause), it's a compilation of apparently traditional tunes of varying character--from somber and stately, to what can only be described as ferociously and militantly upbeat--all rendered with unbridled verve and utter precision by an army of fiddles, with intermittent and resounding percussion and bagpipes. Truly a tour de force. (Alas, the concluding five tracks on the CD are nowhere near as interesting--or as gripping; so pay for it, but be careful of how much.... )"
2,Not as described,"This is not a ""heavy duty"" light stand. It is not even a medium duty. I would suggest it is a light duty light stand. I am keeping it only because I may have a use for it with a small flash later on. But I am definitely going to have to buy a REAL. Heavy Duty from a more reliable brand like manfrotto. I should have known that you get what you pay for."
1,Like Jack but...,I really like this Jack but after 9 months and maybe a dozens uses the O-ring went out and there is only a 90 day warranty.
1,waste of money,I have the the f2533. The release valve screw stripped and the company doesn't sell a replacement.Total waste of money..... don't buy it or any product from the Shinn Fu company.
3,"For this price, keep looking.","Same as the other reviewer, except I guess I count myself lucky since mine worked for a few years as a backup portable jack. Still <50 uses most likely. Seals went, oil leaking everywhere, and into the scrap pile with it! For the lesser price I paid a couple years back it wasn't a bad deal but for this kind of money try a Big Red. For a company that markets ""Pro-Lift"", there's definitely nothing ""pro"" about um... Shinn Fu f2365."
2,Go Fish book,"I was surprised when I received the book, which had a excellent rating, and found writing inside it. Usually, the excellent ratings are for books which do not contain writing in them. I was very disappointed with the book."
3,intresting,I am not a ballet dancer this was for my little sister i was suprised this was 1 ribbon not two i'm unsure if thats how its supposed to be or not ? also when it arrive the plastic was wrinkled and sketchy looking their wasn't anything wrong with it but that seemed odd to me.
4,I love color changing solar lights,"These are great lights they are sturdy and easy to put together. They will look great in any garden or pathway, they add that touch of the unexpected. They are the last lights to come on and they do change color a too fast. I have purchased 2 more set for my gardens and front yard."
3,HOW THE SOLAR LIGHTS WORK,I RECEIVED TWO OF THE SOLAR LIGHTS AND ONLY ONE OF THE LIGHTS WORKS.I TRIED CHARGING THE BATTERIES AND EVEN BOUGHT NEW BATTERIES AND ONE OF THE LIGHTS WILL NOT WORK AT ALL.I CONTACTED AMAZON ABOUT THE PROBLEM BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A NEW LIGHT OR BEEN TOLD TO RETURN THE ONE THAT DOES NOT WORK.STILL WAITING FOR SOME RESPONSE.GUION GARNER
4,Good product.,Wish they were a bit brighter but the do good enough. I use them to mark the veg. flower garden and maybe help keep racoons and possum.
2,Misrepresentation!!!!,"The lights are OK. However, I felt that what I received was not what was pictured. In fact I ordered the product TWICE, thinking there was mistake the first time. The display shows 7 color lights. What you actually receive are 2 lights. Each light has 2 color changes. You do not get to pick the colors...it is all random. Thus the add SHOULD read ""Solar Light w/ 2 colors- set of 2"""
2,Rusted less than a month,"These lights add a nice touch to your patio or back yard and that was the reason why i have been buying so many of them and giving them to friends. On the box it was indicated that it was water resistant and that they are safe to be used outdoors. The ones i have in my back yard (close to a sprinkler) rusted and the lights don't work any more. so i ended up purchasing more from ABCTOY4me and will givie it one last shot. if they rust again, i am going to return them."
1,Don't last through HEAVY rainfall,"They only worked for 1 week!! I tested them with new batteries and still didn't work. I found out that if it rain hard and they get really wet, they will not work..it's true! I spent a pretty penny for these things and will NEVER buy them again. Buyer beware."
1,To costly,"I ordered a set of 8 for under $40.00 at Christmas time for a gift. I misunderstood when I ordered these, was surprised when only 2 arrived for the cost. It was my mistake so I kept them. They are overpriced, and not as nice as the others."
3,Neat but ok,"They work great, but a little pale in the brightness category. They look really good with the xmas lights. If you like color you will enjoy these."
1,What workout?,"A friend of mine just gave me one of these. Knowing I've been working out she figured it might help me on days I don't go to the gym.I would love to say how much it is or isn't helping me, but I can't even use it!It absolutely will not stay on the doorknob, one little pull and it comes down onto your head! Out of the several times I kept trying to get it to stay, the one time it stayed on for more then a few seconds and I was actually able to try and get my feet in it and came straight down. I'm 5'8"" and it is too short for me, how's anyone who's really tall supposed to get it to work.I honestly have to say this product is not very well designed and shouldn't even be on the market."
4,Out of shape,"Yes,definitely and this product certainly has helped me get on track with an exercise routine. I need help lifting my thunder thighs and if I can use my arms to that end - well double fitness for me! If I can feel a burn, it must be doing something. I have not had a problem with it falling off the doorknob or too short ropes( move away from the door and r-e-a-c-h for the handles). It may not be for long term fitness, but it certainly is a start."
3,Bally fitness pilates door knob rope excerciser,The rope is to short. I'm all the way up to the door (on top of it). The one I had years ago when they first came out had a longer rope. Also the cushion that goes around the handle is not needed. I had to tie the rope around the door knob because it keeps coming off.
1,Junk--Don't Bother!,"This is a piece of junk--don't bother. when I originally ordered thought it was Bally's with the Balls at the end. This is just rope with pulleys. Not even elasticized. And really, when you return and have to pay postage, you are paying for the item and getting nothing."
3,To Help People Properly Use This Item,"I don't have a lot to add to what people have said about this product. It would be nice if it were more strongly constructed, but it works just fine for what it is. It is extremely affordable, and you can't really expect something that costs less than $10 to last you for ages. The reason I'm adding a review is to let consumers know HOW to use this item. Most of the reviews mention something about how ""it won't stay on the doorknob!!!"" - those people are not attaching it properly. You need to slip the doorknob loop over the knob OPPOSITE the side of the door on which you are exercising. Therefore, even if the loop does manage to slip off, the door itself holds the equipment. Personally, when set up correctly, I've never had it slip off the doorknob. I just could not resist writing this review, because it was driving me nuts that so many people are of such a low IQ that they cannot figure out how to set up a ridiculously simple piece of workout equipment..."
1,great product,"excellent quality, easy to use and fun, easy purchase arrived quickly and in great condition , no assembly required and fun"
2,Not,"The rope was shredding from the day that I bought it. Pieces fell in my face, eyes & hair, so much that I quit using it."
1,Not well designed,the product is not well designed. The ropes do not clear the casings and pieces of the rope are shredded.
4,a good workout,"this door exerciser provides a good workout, i can feel it in my legs and stomach. i love it, and you can't beat the price!"
1,What gives!,"This product does not stay attached to the door knob, as it shows on the instructions. Also it is to short and not made well. I do not recommened thid product.."
3,Use this for parts only.,"Like most other reviewers, I had the nylon rope with nylon pulley's that finally broke. Couldn't find anything like it so got this even with all the bad reviews. For 10 bucks, it was worth the try. The ropes are way too short and I'm only 5'3"". But....the pulley's are great. I took the thing apart and used the pulley's on my nylon ropes and also changed the knob attachment. It works fine now, when I use it!"
1,ridiculous~!!!!!,"I was so dissapointed with these ridiculous films (series) made by a Japanese large famous movie studio TOEI. I am a Japanese, and I have black belt in Kyokushin. I was a Oyama's student. So, I bought these movie series, and watched them. What a cheap crap movies~! if you really want to see Mas Oyama's Karate, buy one from Media 8. Do not wast time and money on these movies. OSU~!"
1,Poor Quality,"This drive crashed within a week after I put it in use. I wipoed the data clean, and reinstalled everything, it crashed again, I took my computer to a trusted service person, he confirmed the drive was no good, and said he does not like this brand."
4,"Genesis to the present day. Hope, despair, and history.","When I first got this album, to be honest, I didn't like it! However, it's grown on me with listening. There is more depth than meets the ear to start with. Tracks like 'The Cry' have brought to us the emotions of God - in this one over the murder of Abel. Most of the lyrics for this album, like the previous Moriah are taken from Hebrew poetry from previous millenia, and are worth listening to. The album has given me a sense of the history and emotion that is behind the Jewish Christian percetion of Jerusalem. Some of the tracks are not as musically complex as much of Adrian's work is, but have a simplicity much akin to folk music. This one's a bit different, but if you like the rest of Adrian's stuff, I think you'll like this one too."
1,Not what I wanted,I'm not saying that this product was not as advertised. Just saying that it didn't have the same scent as the L'Heure Bleue by Guerlain that I wore for over 30 years. I returned it and received a prompt refund. Easy transaction. Thanks.
2,mysterious,"I bought this a few years ago-not here- when I was first delving into the fragrance classics and this was so raved. About. Perhaps I got a fake, who knows, but the juice I received I would describe as just boring and nondescript as hell. You could wear it to the office and nobody would be offended, because it just smells like generic soap and powder. Subtle, yes, romantic, I don't think so. Reminds me a little of Shalimar without the personality or Lauren. Remember this came out before WW I, perhaps it was easier to excite people in the days before radio. I wore it a couple of times and I should give it away. Check the Salvation Army near you."
3,An Okay Read...,"This book is a nice read, but can get annoy sometimes. Katharina is sometimes portrayed as a whiny, selfish, jealous woman who uses manipulation to get what she wants. I believe the author should done more research on the marriage and family life of Martin Luther and Katharina von Bora. If she wanted to take fictional liberties with this book, at she could have made Martin Luther and Katie more true to the actual characters.I've almost all of Luther's letters and his contemporaries' descriptions of him, and he in no way is the uncaring husband and father that the author portrays him as. As for Katharina, Luther, in his letters, often said that she was a ""good, pious, and obedient wife..."" The Katharina is this book is a nightmare!"
2,Research? - where are the citations?,"The author claims to have done long, in depth research into the life and times of Katharina Von Bora, from which she weaves a very personal and also controversial tale. So, where are any of the citations of any of these in depth resources? I give her two stars for fiction and a question mark for historical bio."
4,An Interesting Perspective,"This was a good book. I enjoyed learning the minutia of life in the 1500s and learning about Luther from Katarina's perspective. I'm not Lutheran, so knew little about his history. I was curious about the sexual innuendos about Katie and Ave...seemed a little gratuitous to me - and may be offensive to Lutherans, but I would certainly recommend this book to others."
5,What a cute toy,"This toy is my three year old daughters favorite Christmas gift. She loves to connect the little puppies onto the mother to nurse. We live on a farm with numerous animals, so this is nothing new to her. What I like the most about this toy is the imagination aspect of it without any electronics, batteries or noise. The pups attach to the mother with magnets. Just an all around nice, quiet, imagination enhancing toy."
1,WHAT KIND OF STUFFED ANIMAL IS THIS??? A Kid's Review,I don't understand why they would have a stuffed animal like this. I don't like it at all. It's so disgusting how every minute I try to play with it but all it does is the Nana dog nusing her puppies! THERE IS NO SENSE IN GETTING THIS! Take my advice cause I am a kid at the age of 14 and even when I was 10 I hated it. Don't get it please.
5,NURSING DOG,ONE GRANDAUGHTER WANTED THIS DOG & WAS REALLY SUPRIZED WHEN SHE FOUND OUT THAT THE PUPS STUCK TO MAMA DOG WITH FELCRO & DIDN'T FALL OFF
1,Poor Quality,This toy looks much better on Amazon. It was supposed to be a Christmas present. I would never give this as a gift! The fabric does not look the same in person. The pups are sewn on. I had a similiar toy years ago and the pups had velcro and were removable. The fur was a much better quality.
2,Won't work with MacBook,I must have bought the wrong product but this doesn't work with my MacBook. I have a mini DVI adapter and tried to connect to my television but it doesn't even register that there is another display.
2,Product did not work with a DVI out DVD player - seller did not refund $$,"I purchased the wrong part - this cable will not convert digital to analog output - I spoke to the seller and was given a printing label for free return shipping. When I shipped it back the post office said I could not get tracking on this due to the sellers shipment method. I figured since they had the info it would be fine, but the seller never refunded my money and due to their ""free return shipping"" label I have no confirmation. I would be careful about purchasing from this shipper as returns are not handled the same way as Amazon handles their merchandise. I contacted seller and the said that they would refund my money once the item has arrived - that was over a month ago and still no refund."
1,Didn't work for me,I couldn't hook up my Mac to my TV with this and that's what I was looking for. The product spec was all garbled to make much sense. So I gave it a try. I am sorry I did.
1,Cable did not work,"This cable does NOT work, DO NOT buy it.I checked its wiring Vs the HDMI/DVI spec (via an ohm meter).It is wired completely incorrectly. The analog signals on the connector (pins C1, C2, & C3) do not make it to the RCA connectors.I will try and get my money back."
2,"Computer works with it, but not TV","I figured I would give it a shot to see if I could finally have a use for component, but it was a no-go. My Sapphire 5850 had no problems trying to show it as a second screen, but my TV just wouldn't show a picture. I tried changing the resolution in Catalyst Control Center, but not one of the dozen or so options made the TV show a picture. My TV's connections are YPbPr, so maybe that's the problem (even though it says in the description that it works w/that connection). Or maybe it's just time for me to get a new TV with HDMI and a long HDMI cable to my computer. Hello Christmas wish!"
4,Great item,This cable have durability and also works great. i use this cable to hook up from my pc to my tv and it works great.
1,Doesn't work with nVidia GTX 560Ti,"I bought this with the intention of sending one of the DVI ports from my nVidia GTX 560Ti video card to a Hauppauge PVR to record game footage. I know that DVI to component is testy and doesn't work in all cases so I bought this on a whim, but unfortunately I can confirm that it does not work with this setup. Still exploring options that will work with this video card."
5,"An American in Paris isn't bad,either","Just heard An American in Paris from this disc and I have to say it is the best performance I've heard of that piece.Michael Tilson Thomas and the NY Philharmonic have a way with this music,: Il n'est pas vrai?"
1,clank your pan lids together - its the same,"I didn't expect much from these, but my son wanted cymbals for Christmas. I found these within the price range I wanted to pay, as I didn't want to purchase real band quality cymbals for play. These are really small, rusty looking with big red bows on them. They really don't resemble real cymbals, but even worse they sound terrible. You can clank your pans lids together and get a better sound quality. I don't know what you could use these for."
2,Star Wars Boxed Set; Episodes I-VI,"Having purchased this set early for my grandson's birthday, not until I was ready to wrap it (about 1 1/2 months later) did I see that there were two (2) episode II books in the boxed package and no episode III included. How disappointing! Today I placed an order for Episode III, so my grandson will be able to enjoy the entire series."
2,as listed,"had done a search for dvds and these were included,really thought I was buying a box set of dvd's.me..I hate to read."
1,No images,The lack of images is disturbing. I cannot follow the book when it refers to figures that are not included in the book. Mind that this is the kindle version.
3,On technical ability alone,"The songs are uninspire and repetitive and the sound of Eklundh's guitar is flat and empty most of the time. And in general the album suffers from an extreme sense of Satriani-esque inability to let anything but the guitar shine. I love Satch. I love Eklundh's ability to play (same for Vai most of the time) but Satch and Eklundh could learn a little from Vai in that he allows his backing musicians to do something once in a while. There are a few good songs on this album - Time to Breath for one - but mostly its tricks and silly loops. Don't expect a musical genius here. I hear Eklundh is now with Jonas Hellborg. At least there all the musicians will get to shine, but the songs with be drawn out and have all the emotive capability of a rock."
3,The way the net used to be,Accurate and thorough description of the U.S. part of the public Internet circa 1990. Good historical document; lots of the people mentioned in the text are still hard at work keeping the net running.
3,Great way to peer back at the Internet before it became the Internet,"The concept behind this book is very interesting and it's something that wouldn't be possible in today's Internet. It's a directory of every server and network on the Internet before people knew what the Internet was and before the web existed.For the most part it's just a text directory with hostnames (or IP addresses), the admin and their phone number. But the interesting part are the sprinkle of network maps that show all spokes of each network from college to college along with the connection speed of each line. Please note this book lists all major domains: .MIL, .EDU, .GOV. etc.From a pre-internet aspect, it's very interesting, but outside of the maps themselves, the book doesn't hold much interest."
2,"Smooth, precise, resonant ... bloodless ... boring","Like so many present-day performers, Suzuki and his forces and BIS's engineers deliver a technically polished, wonderfully sounding performances. And like so many contemporaries, this performance is smooth and shapeless. I listen to this recording wondering if the piece even matters."
4,A classic and must-have,"This selection of legends by Wilhelm Ruland, translated by Andrew Mitchell and H.J. Findlay, is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in German legend and lore. The stories themselves are related according to the city on the Rhine and its corresponding story. Of course the most famous legends are included at least in part--Die Neibelungenleid and the Lorelei.Unfortunately, these stories are greatly condensed and therefore not extrememly literary, but Ruland can be quite lyrical at times. Overall, I recommend the book to anyone who is interested in legends or German culture as a starting point."
4,Great book,"I work in a factory located in Brazil, and our business is the manufacturing of optical precision products. This book has been a great help and good evolution in the sense of helping us to develope new techniques to produce our material."
4,A world of otherwise out of range possibilities.,"I read the book. I decided to try the simple system. It's a thoughtful, methodical approach. Don't ignore any step. I wanted to accept an invitation to run management courses in Poland. My Polish sponsors couldn't pay my fares. Being careful to follow Ross's system I contacted our (Australian) Dept Trade saying I believed what I proposed was consistent with Aus's aid policy to former Soviet countries. They agreed and Aust embassy, Warsaw paid my return fares after receiving positive feedback from my Polish sponsors (who provided accommodation). By asking for the moon the Percy Ross way I got it - a free trip to Europe - all I had to do was sing for my supper. People who live off grants are probably used to this sort of thinking but for me the Ross book was a revelation. Carefully attend to each of Ross's steps. They will open up a life enriching world of otherwise out of range possibilities. Victor Barnes"
5,Pleased Biology Teacher,"This is an excellent way to introduce the Class Insecta to-""I hate science!""-students. It grabs their attention and at the same time provides them with correct and useful information on creepy crawlers. Hint: Eyewitness has videos on many other animal classes:retiles-fish-birds-etc. I have never been disappointed with the reactions of my students towards these wonderful videos."
3,"Good History, but not enough analysis","I picked up this biography after reading Sears' ""To the Gates of Richmond"" which fascinated me with it's portrait of McClellan. Always suspecting he was being conspired against or being faced with overwhelming enemy forces, General McClellan has got to be one of America's most paranoid military figures. I hoped that a book devoted to his life would add some insight regarding this failing in a supposed military genius. Unfortunately, although the book reinforces the charcter of McCLellan with further incident, I finished without getting the feeling that I understood the sources of his fears. I've loved Mr Sears' other books on the Civil War and its various campaigns. The high quality of his other histories left me a little disappointed with this outing."
3,Not the best,"I love MMW. This EP, however, was not all I had hoped. Granted, The Dracula Remix and Macha, were very good, but everything else was not up to par."
5,Still Sundown,This is a very interesting book. I grew up in the South and I never realized that so many sundown towns existed in the North and Midwest. I had my doubts about this book but that has all been laid to rest. If you are interested in this subject Read This Book!
3,Sort of expanded manufacturers literature to this reader.,"This book tells about many glues and when they are normally used. It is not a definitive source. Lacking are complete technical descriptions of chemistry and why the glues work. After reading the book I didn't feel that I knew any more than I would have from reading the ""always positive"" manufacturers literature. If the author had the confidence to make some solid committal statements about what glues would be strongest when, it would have helped."
3,I couldn't put it down!,A nice work on a sticky subject. I have a feeling this book will stick with me for a long time.
4,"Good, Not as good as previous novels...","Never Street is an excellent addition to the Amos Walker series. After a client turns missing, Amos must investigate, leading him into the seamy underworld of blackmail and betrayal and one man's obsession with noir film.While I liked Never Street, I am not a big fan of 'old movies,' which I felt was an underlying theme in this installment. Film Noir is a genre, I think that is much better 'viewed' than read about. Overall, another light, entertaining read with plenty of puns and snappy comebacks, sure to delight fans of the rest of the series."
4,Amos...who?,"Loren Estleman can write! No doubt. He can create the scene, the people, the plot. I think Amos Walker is very true as a P.I. Great book about a man's passion for old noir films that become a smoke screen for his disappearance. You can feel Amos Walker. He is a street smart man that is not of the street. Amos is no schmoe."
4,"Nice set, but smaller than I expected.","My 7 year old niece is crazy about Snoopy and I got this for her as a Birthday present. She's loves it. I was surprised that the pillow was so small, but it is a napping pillow and is perfect for a stroller. The blanket is fairly large and very comfortable. Overall what matters is what the kids think and she gives it a big thumbs up :-)"
1,I'll join the criticism,"I just returned this book a few days ago, having been totally disenchanted with its content. I'm a twentysomething -- and no, I'm not the ""president of my own business"" -- but I do know a helpful book when I see one. And this wasn't it. Just useless, condescending advice from someone who seems about as sincere as Bob Barker."
1,Useless book,"I purchased this book after giving it a very quick flip-throughat the bookstore, but I am sorry I didn't peruse it more carefully first. This book is appalingly useless. Some of the so-called ""Top 50 careers"" include things like ""Odd Jobs."" Odd jobs is a career? Please. The book's content is insulting to me as a 20-something. (Judging by the online reviews of the book. others apparently agree with me...the only positive comment, from an ""mdowning,"" must be a marketeer for Richardson, since the same person's comments appear for Richardson's JobSmarts book & it reads like an ad.) Don't be fooled...save your money."
1,Pee-Yew!,What a tired concept -- and a tired treatment of it. Doesn't this Richardson guy have anything better to do with his time?
1,"Poorly written, poorly researched, save your money.","This book does not deliver on its promises. The information has not been researched in each field beyond a few actual cases, making the accuracy of the information highly suspect. There is much better information available on this subject from other sources, including the Occupational Outlook Handbook (put out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Very smug, very unprofessional writing. Save your money."
2,"oh, well!","The comments here are pretty funny -- but true. The book certainly doesn't bring anything new to the table...if anything, it takes things away. But hey, what do I know, I'm a thirtysomething and not ""THE Expert for Generation X."""
