5,Jack Black Rocks!,"Nevermind the improbability of almost every situation in the movie; Jack Black is so entertaining from Minute 1 that you won't be able to notice. And even if it nags a little as you leave the theater with fond memories of an hour and 45 minutes well spent, you won't even care. Jack Black is one of the funniest men on any screen around, and here his talent is cranked up to 11!Plan on taking the kiddies along for this one. Apart from the whole 'stick it to the man' thing -- a philosophy that kids should probably eschew, at least until they are a couple of semesters into college -- there is little very objectionable here (though a little 'Parental Guidance'-type discussion in the car afterward is never a bad thing. Including a 'make your dreams work for you' in that could be an appropos coda)."
2,I wanted to like it,"I really tried to like this movie, but it was just not happening. It was mostly silly and mildly entertaining."
3,rented this,"after hearing a review on NPR. It is okay, I guess, but no where as special as the reviewer made it out to be. It is his most favorite forever movie, though, and he is a critic for NPR."
3,"Cute, entertaining, but JB should add more dimension","Older kids will like this film so tht is something to consider. JB plays a loser whose only goal is to play rock and roll. The side characters are not developed and remain caricatures. Too bad, there are some good actors who could do more with better lines. Jack Black can be charming and engaging, but he relies too much on mugging. Of course kids tend to like overacting so it may be better suited for kids, although there is enough of a plot to entertain adults."
3,disappointed,"The movie is not boring and it keeps you entertain but when you go out of the theater, you have the feeling that you have just seen a Disney movie which was made for kids. Why? Because the story is unbelievable the way Disney movies are.This guy has all these dreams about becoming a rock star and ends up playing with very young kids and finally really looks like a loser."
2,School of Clichés,"This is usually the kind of movie I would love. It has so much going for it (Jack Black, Richard Linklater, classic rock, etc.), but I found the plot and premise to be full of clichés. In a nutshell, the film is about a cool rock 'n roll rebel who has to deal with a bunch of stiff, stuffy people (parents, teachers) and eventually prevails in the end. I just felt like I had seen it all before."
2,Disappointing,"This movie's plot deals with a no-good wannabe rock star (Jack Black, wildly overacting as usual) suddenly and by mistake taking the job of substitute teacher at a posh school (right, things like this happen all the time), and using it to teach rock music to his students (who are around 9). Most of the music is from the early 70s, so probably not even the children's parents were born when this music was made. I think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time (it reminds me of another poor movie, Velvet Goldmine, where glam rock, a marginal movement if there was one, was treated as a major artistic achievement, a la par with Oscar Wilde!). And shouldn't each generation choose the music it wishes to be represented with?."
2,School of Dull,"Honestly, I really like Jack Black, but his talents are wasted in this film. I just didn't find it funny. There were some pop culture moments that were humorous, but nothing to laugh out loud about.Maybe it's just not my type of comedy? The kids were dull. I could care less if they played really well. OK, the kids were boring. There, I said it. Let the heavens fall.Was this about kids finding a new means of self-expression a la Dead Poets Society? No, it was about Jack Black's character needing rent money. Yawn. Dull. Forgettable."
3,kinda funny,"It has some funny moments, but it just isn't all that great. It got to the point where I didn't care how it ended, but that is all you can expect from Jack Black. One of his better films though. The plot was really dumb. It tried to seem as jack black bringing back rock and roll and things like that aren't heart tuching anymore. The kids we pretty good actors, but the songs they song weren't all that entertaining. A bunch of kids pretending to play instruments that they learned( in the movie) in a short period of time. Very cheesy and simple"
5,ROCK!,"There are a number of films that center around the relationship between a gifted teacher and his/her students. Mr. Holland's Opus. The Dead Poets Society. Music of the Heart.This is one of those films, in the same way that The Legend of the Overfiend is an animated romance.This movie was obviously fun to make, and it shows. Jack Black is very funny, which is not surprising. What is surprising is how well he interacts with the ten year old kids in his classroom, and how amazingly talented most of those kids are. I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would (I suspected to find it mediocre) and I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,Great Tunes,"I really liked this movie, but I could not give it 5 stars, although I wanted to. Why not? Not up to a five-star standard, even though I really liked it personally. It had a good mix of music, humor, and emotion, but it just wasn't up to par.The soundtrack is decent, especially if you are a Classic Rock lover like myself. Many references to AC/DC and some to other classic acts.It seems like a watered down ""Sister Act 2"" -- in acting, in drama, in sound. Not bad, just not as good as it could have been."
3,showcase for Jack Black,"A failed rock guitarist fakes his way into a substitute teaching job, uses the kids to form a band, and teaches them a valuable lesson about self-esteem on the way. Sounds like typical Hollywood nonsense? Well, thanks to the anarchic comic presence of Jack Black, all sentiment is defeated and SCHOOL OF ROCK is a very fine light comedy. Black is playing essentially the same character he did in HIGH FIDELITY, which is good, since he does it well. His ingenuousness as a performer and surprising physical comedy abilities really overwhelm the thin premise and keep the laughs coming. Joan Cusack-not given nearly enough to do-is very funny as the school principal."
3,School of Rock hits some high notes,"The kids in this movie are incredible musicians at such young ages. Dewey Finn loves rock 'n roll so much he tries his hardest not to give up on his dreams. Dewey gets kicked out of his own band for his amazing lack of talent. He is busy mooching off of his friends and is behind in the rent. Dewey gets the idea to be a substitute teacher when his friend gets a call from a desperate principal. The scenes of him in the classroom are sad, pitiful, and depressing. The whole idea of his being a substitute teacher is preposterous. However there are times when you love this movie and want to laugh out loud."
4,"Implausible, but great fun.","I doubt this movie was meant to be taken as a slice of life. If it was, it certainly didn't work at that level. I took it as more of a fable about loving something deeply and how that love could affect the lives of others. The Jack Black character wasn't very good at what he did (That song he ""wrote"" for the kid band was hilariously bad; kind of like Black Sabbath meets Jethro Tull at a crack house), but his passion for rock gave his life a spark despite his admitted mediocrity. You couldn't help but root for the man. I also liked the way the film tried to give the kids a little more character than the average movie of this type. The adult scenes didn't work as well, but I did like the part where the buttoned-down principal and Ned were talking in the van. Her explanation about the pressures of adult life and what they can do to you were spot on.The music, of course, was the star, especially if you were around when it all started. A little nostalgia never hurt anyone."
3,wheres Bodge?,"Int eh scene where the kid is looking at footage of old gitar players how come they dont shoiw bodge? He's only the best, most popular gitarist out there!! My friend Brett, who is a genious says these days you cant swing your arms without seeing Bodge on tv in commercials(the one where the wife gets mad at teh husband because she takes to long to pick out her clothes) and on pbs. I dont get it, though, unless you were in a room full of tvs with bodge on them. THis is a mixed metafor, people! anyway get this move staring Jack Black (former girlfriend of renee Zellweigger (you might have herd of her). The kids are cute and it is a good way to kill 2 hours. But, sadly, where's Bodge?????"
3,"Very funny, but disturbing to see kids using language","I wanted to give this more stars. I think the character Dewey perfectly sums up in a delightfully honest, humorous way, the failed educational philosophy of John Dewey (Hey! Teacha! Leave those kids alone...)But you're not watching this for the philosophy. You're watching it for the humor, and possibly for Jack Black. You will get some good doses of that, although probably nothing will rival Nacho Libre.The reason I can't give it more stars is, it's terribly disturbing to see young children using language and dressing in skimpy clothes. I wouldn't let a child do something that.It's reasonably funny, and I love Joan Cusack's acting. Jack Black did a fine job although, like I said, he can probably never rival himself as he was in Nacho Libre if you're a Jack Black fan. But he's also done much worse in his mockery of Jesus. Greatly dampens my enthusiasm for future projects. A pity."
3,A decent movie for the most part....,"First, I would like to start off by saying, why does Jack Black feel the need to rip-off Angus Young's school uniform? He also uses a Gibson SG....although not the same kind Angus uses, it's still of cheap imitation. Otherwise, the overall theme of the movie is pretty good. The roles in the movie were played well, except for the kid that played the drums. It seems to me that if you had other ""child stars"" that were in the cast, then they could have found someone halfway-decent to be the drummer. It makes it seem like it's not important to have a good drummer in a band and they're just there in the background. All I can say is, oh well. What can you expect from movie directors that don't know very much about music in general. As far as Jack Black is concerned, this was one of his better movies I thought. Decent movie. 3 out of 5 stars."
5,Masterpiece!!,"This movie is a comedy masterpiece. Its Jack Black at his best. He should of got an award for this one! I cant believe I didnt see this when it first came out but only discovered it a few months ago. Up until then my favorite Jack Black movie was Shallow Hal, but this one gives it a run for its money. If you can excuse the word ""ass"" coming out of a few ten year olds mouths your kids will enjoy it too, mine absolutely love it. (I am not one to allow kids to cuss but I am sure most have heard that word by the time they are ten) ."
3,great movie!,"no digital code. seller offered to return funds and take movie back. we like the movie, but it is advertised as having a digital copy. there is no code to unlock the digital copy. we'll keep it, but buyer beware!"
3,So-so rock comedy.,"School of Rock starring Jack Black is a decent comedy about a slaker who poses as a teacher and ends inspiring his students about the history of rock music. The story is cool but something's missing and I can't figure out what it is? I can't stand Sarah Silverman, she's an unfunny slob while Joan Cusak knows a thing or two about comic timing. Great family flick, it's a mixed bag for me."
3,3 1/2 stars...not the best not the worse...,"The School of Rock has potential; the kids were cute, and the movies gets funnier each time you watch it, but, it is a movie that is more serious and tries to be funny. For me this movie would have worked better as a serious movie. I would say rent this movie before buying it."
5,This movie is so much fun!,I bought it for myself and also as a Christmas gift for my brother. I recommend it for any Jack Black fan.
3,"Not bad, not great.","Not a bad movie, nothing outstanding either except for the concept. I enjoied it enough to keep watching and wondering what would happen next, but I doubt I'd want to see it again.Shallow Hal remains Jack Blacks best work to date. School of Rock would be at a distant second."
4,Schooled by Jack,"I thought this was a surprisingly good movie. Jack Black plays his enthusiastic rock and roll self, much better I think than his older attempts at romantic lead or cynic. His unique take on most topics contrasted well with the preppy fifth-graders he was matched with. I thought the chemistry of all of the characters was great, and that Joan Cusack was great as the principal. Definitely time wellspent in the theater."
5,A movie for the whole family!,"Being a parent of a teenager, I can say that this movie is kid safe. My daughter and I watched this together and were laughing our butts off. There are also some lessons for overly uptight parents to learn here. The biggest being: Let kids be kids- they'll have the rest of their lives to become adults with unrealized dreams. Kids will love it and adults will love it. There's tons of references both will appreciate. Black may set some folks off with Tenacious D. Fair enough. He has the same attitude but it's completely clean. Tenacious D fans should add this to their DVD collections. Non fans should thoroughly enjoy this as well. This movie stands on its own."
4,JACK BLACK IS CUTE AND THE KIDS ARE EVEN CUTER,"Pretty much a normal Jack Black vehicle, but for the element of kids and opening the world of music to them and all the positive, life affirming changes that are a result of this musical education. Black is very good (for what it is) in this role. In the back story in special features, the director said he wrote this for Jack Black, specifically. Very few actors could have done as good in this part as Black. In real life, Black is an accomplished musician, and, I believe a nice guy that is still a kid at heart. That really comes across in this movie. And there are laughs. And the music is good. This movie is not, necessarily, a long term keeper, but I liked watching it and I would watch it again knowing I would like it again. I recommend it. GOOD JOB JACK."
4,Not perfect but....,"I had Lasik surgery in the year 2000, since then i have tried Sunglasses from regular Ray-Ban, to polarized versions of these , plus Maui-Jim...let me be clear: they are quite good but too expensive. I decided to research another option: BluBlockers. one of the side effects of Lasik is the ""halo"" effect plus the sensitivity to light . I got myself the VIPER version of the BluBlockers with out any major expectation..all i can say is ..wow...i cannot go out side without them . the clarity is amazing , the protection from uv rays seem to be working as my eyes feel rested. My only complaint is the materials(frame) used to manufacture them. they seem honestly cheap; sad as the lenses do deliver what they promise...i decided to order the original design pair as i want to try a different version..for 15.00 bucks is not a bad deal compared to over 200.00 i spent on my Maui Jim a few years ago."
2,No Warranty,"These sunglasses from Blublocker (Las Vegas company) used to be a good product. Now, there is no warranty on the glasses. You won't receive any paperwork with the sunglasses, just a box with some advertising on it and no mention of what to do if they break. I have tried to correspond with their customer service group (or should I say customer service-less) and the lastest classic answer for my sunglasses purchased in 2007 (nose piece weld broke) is that the warranty does not apply after 2006 and they do not fix them. Very clever way of saying don't bother us. I am a former customer and I recommend that you check into this product (not cheap) before dropping any hard earned cash."
3,Perfectly Functional But Fragile,"Started buying these sunglasses when first introduced on infomercials (the classic version) way back when. They have served me well over the years. Have gone through many pairs, at least thirty. But they are very fragile and easily broken. The lenses scratch easily, too. That is not to say that I don't love the beautiful ""orange"" hue they provide when looking through them which makes them so appealing. And this style has a unique feature in the way they fit perfectly over my subscription glasses. Until recently, was paying $14.99 a pair and would usually buy three at a time. When one broke, would throw out and go to next pair. Notice now they are charging $59.99 each. Wow, no way! Too expensive! Not worth more than fifteen dollars, because of above mentioned qualities. Will now have to look for similar substitutes priced at or below what I used to pay."
4,Sad but true,"I was gifted this book when my first son was married and the 'two key phrases' you will read about in this book have carried me through 5 years of that marriage now. Since then, I have purchased this book for many friends with sons getting married to prepare them for their new role as MOG = mother of the groom. The book is written 'tongue in cheek' but makes many good points, an easy read over lunch, but something you may read over and over again during wedding day preparations. I have known several FOG's = father of the groom who have read this book too, some more then once."
4,An entertaining read,"""The Long Ball"" is definitely an entertaining read. There were laugh-out-loud moments as the author described some of the plays in the '75 World Series. The first half of the book covers the regular '75 season, many of its players and teams, while the second half concentrates on the post-season. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because the author's slant in favor of the Boston Red Sox eventually emerges as an unmistakable bias. I would have liked to see the book's approach be more even-handed between the Reds and Red Sox, especially since it was the Reds that won the World Series, not Boston. Still, a very enjoyable read. Recommended."
3,Error prone,"It's a good read, interesting enough thesis of linking the 1975 season and the coming of free agency. Bit of a stretch though to make the series that year to be fork in the road of the future of baseball.Most worrisome is the sloppiness with the facts. I was astonished to read Adelman blow it on Dwight Evans' spectacular and oft-replayed catch in the sixth game claiming that Dwight pulled the ball out of the path to the bullpen. The bullpen was nowhere near the catch - he caught it by going several rows deep into the stands. How could a serious student of the game get this, of all plays, wrong? Makes one wonder how many other mistakes he made."
5,HORSES ARE GOOD MEDICINE AND DESERVE AS MUCH IN RETURN,"Every horse owner should know a bunch about medicating horses, or shouldn't own one (or be owned by one). This is your ticket for learning, but I suggest you try your first flight at it with a vet on hand."
5,GREAT,"I just got this book today. Shipped immediately and got in pretty quick. The book itself i haven't got to read a whole lot but what I have read i am amazed with. The book covers medicines from hormones (breeding and otherwise),antibiotics, to bute(pain killer) to stuff i have never heard of lol. LOVE ITHighly recommend it"
2,Masterpiece one better by far,"This version is so bad! Save your money and buy the Masterpiece one starring Helen Morse and Bryan Brown - my favorite movie and book can't count the times I've read it, watched it and loved it!! These are people of substance and real romance not the trash they put out now!"
4,Not too shabby for a follow up and band change,Murder the World is essentially an entirely different band than on Pure. Don't expect the same sound. I am less a fan of the Pure line up (sounds like a more black metal version of Fear Factory) than the Murder the World lineup. Both have their individual qualities; I just hope that the band lineup from Murder the World is what we can expect for the future of this group.
2,Seems like a good idea,"This seemed like it was going to be really cool, and it was. For about 3/4 of a room. Then the locking mechanism broke...You end up with a roller frame that operates like a yo-yo. Turned out to be a real pain.A good idea produced very cheaply is just junk."
2,broke it after a couple of hours,"Good idea. Weakly constructed. I was working with this roller frame fully extended and the thinner of the two extension parts buckled at the twist tightener. I admittedly was applying some pressure but in my opinion not enough to warrant busting like it did. I'm not that strong. In any case, don't expect pro-grade and don't apply too much pressure when this thing is extended. The break snapped the plastic that is on the inside of the metal pole parts. I uploaded a picture to share. I'd recommend using a regular rolling frame with a solidly threaded handle for inserting a strong pole.To be fair, I am reluctantly adding one-star (for a total of two) because, in my baby's opinion, I was pressing too hard on the frame."
4,Lane live,"If your a Shawn Lane fan you already have this CD of course. If your a guitar player that can't get excited about songs like ""Get You Back"" or ""Hard Case"", then put down your guitar and never pick it up again, it deserves someone better. The most premier electric guitar perhaps anywhere, but certainly from this country."
2,"OK, But....","Terrible recording quality and the guitar is so heavily reverbed that it gets very annoying after a while. The synth is very lame. Everyone that has reviewed this disc seems to be so impressed with this guy's speed. I'm not. Speed is not impressive if that's all you have to rely on. I think Mr. Big proved that when they used a specially rigged power drill. Tone, taste, and structure is everything and this player lacks the first two. A couple of stars for a few momentary points of interest. I know this will not be popular position and I will be the lone descenting opinion, but as a guitar player myself I really didn't find much of interest on this whole disc. Listen before you fork out an import ransom."
3,No guarantees . . .,"I was certainly set up for disappointment . . . Dr. Williams really got my hopes up. I am a ""perfect"" candidate for getting pregnant naturally and on my own timetable, according to the author. He makes it sound as if you'll get pregnant right away if you follow his technique. The reality for me is that I'm still not pregnant after several months. There IS a lot of good info in this book, just don't let the tone get you prematurely excited like I did."
1,Not worth it,"This book presents a basic knowledge of fertility, and nothing you can't learn on the internet or probably already know. Most of it is common sense. Some of the advice is inapplicable or not always correct - for example it says that OPK's are 95% reliable, when I have yet to get a true positive. It says that Cervical Fluid is a poor indicator of upcoming ovulation, however many women find it is incredibly reliable. I got very little out of this book. Recommend Taking Charge of Your Fertility instead."
1,I don't recommend,"This book contained much of the same information as some of the other books, however it was not as easy to read. I enjoy the books that are more colorful, have graphs and pictures, as well as testimonials. This book lacked in those areas."
1,I need to actually RECEIVE the book in order to review it!!,"I never received this book. When I sign onto Amazon to review my latest purchases (track recent orders) the website shows that I have not had any purchases. I recently bought two pregnancy books. I received one of them just a few short days after the purchase. I never received this book in question, and to add insult to injury, I cannot contact the 'seller' because my account shows no activity??? Makes zero sense!This is my first experience with Amazon and most likley my last..."
3,Outdated but Still Informative,"I found this book to be informative but grossly outdated. It's one of many books I've read about TTCing (Trying To Conceive). This would be okay if it was the *first* book you read before you started TTCing, as it does give a good general overview of the process, tips and tricks, and preconceptual care. However, I would highly recommend Toni Weschler's ""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"". Ms. Weschler's book really helped me understand my cycle through BBTing (Basal Body Temperature). Mr. Williams asserts that BBTing has been replaced by OPKs (Ovulation Predictor Kits). I personally don't agree with discouraging BBTing--especially considering there is software out there now that helps to make interpreting your chart much easier. Perhaps Mr. Williams revised edition will be more up-to-date?"
5,Great book!,"I bought this book upon a recommendation from a friend who owned it. I thought the book was very helpful and we had tremendous success. I read the book a few months before we started to try to get pregnant and we got pregnant the first month we started trying. The book was easy to understand and had good tips in it. I have since recommended this book to several of my friends, all of whom have concieved within 4 months (most within 2 months) of trying."
4,Great beginning book,"I found this book to be very informative and after reading it, I knew what questions to ask my ob/gyn...now we have been referred to an RE and I know what questions to ask him! Our nutrition has become very important to us and have added/subtracted things that he suggested!"
3,Useful but dry,I found the book too wordy. Just reading the summary sections at the end of each chapter can give you all the necessary info you are looking for. Although it gave very little new information to us it did confirm some of our beliefs. The jist of what we got out of the book is to purchase an ovulation kit and not drinking.
3,Disappointing,"I was intrigued by the title of the book, the operative word being fastest. I'm left wondering what the fastest way was. The book was informative, but the author spent a great deal of time discussing infertility problems and treatments, which may be of interest, but should probably belong in another book all together."
2,Only if you cannot afford a better book,"I bought 2 books at the same time; the highest ranked fertility book on this site and then this one. This pales in comparison to the details of the other. This book is VERY basic and is probably nothing new if you've talked with any doctor or gotten on the internet. To sum it up this book is about nutrition and sex often...and we all know those basics. I rated it a 2 because it does at least discuss reasons for infertility. But, if your not getting pregnant within 3 months anyway, it is still good to discuss this with your doctor, so you don't waste valuable time. I would have if I'd have waited 1 year like this book suggests. The other book enabled me to begin charting and it saved me from wasting a year of trying to get pregnant!!"
2,I bought this book and promptly chucked it!,"This book gives some good basic information on conception, but frankly Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler was far more informative and useful. If you know the basics, this is not the book for you. If you don't know the basics, there are much better, more comprehensive books out there that will be of more assistance to you. If you have any fertility issues, this book is definitely NOT for you."
3,Worth reading.........,"I thought some of the information in this book was worth reading. I didn't know you shouldn't use the ovulation predictor kits first thing in the morning, excessive exercise and lubricants can impact fertility, etc. I think this book is for couples who are just starting to try to conceive..not for couples who have already done research on fertility."
2,Where's the fastest way? Mostly a common sense list,"There really is not any new information in this book. It seems to be mostly a list of do's (eat right) and don'ts (no drugs). I was looking for some novel ways to improve chances of conception, and there are really none. I have another book, Trying Again, and the focus is on emotional and physical concerns of couples who have lost a pregnancy or baby, and that book also has all the same facts on how to conceive as this one. The only thing I really like about this book is that is has a chart listing the quantity of caffeine in various beverages and foods. Overall, I think the title of this book is misleading. There is nothing in this book that I can add to what we have already been doing and what we have already learned from other free sources (like patient handouts at the doctor's office - it is all there). Considering his big tip is to use an ovulation predictor kit, you should probably save the money."
4,Very informative and easy to read!!,"As the parents of two children, 11 and 7, we decided we wanted another child, I had no idea how to plan getting pregnant, I hadnt planned it the two previous times, I was just pregnant! With maturity we wanted to plan this out step by step and be aware of the various processes and steps our bodies went thru. This book was it for us!! It is great. It explains everything easily and in plain english!! We arent pregnant yet (it has only been one month) but we are much better informed and educated!! Thank you so much for this book!! I recommend this book for any couples attempting to get pregnant!!"
1,puffery,"Maudlin, over-produced, complete with stirring mood music and lofty voice-overs. All of which would be tolerable if they at least gave us some fight footage, but there's no more than a few seconds from any fight. A waste."
3,School,"Did not really get to use this book and when it was used it was heavy in info, but easy to follow."
1,college text book,I received this in a timely manner and it was it great shape. My daughter will be using this for one of her college courses.
3,fltnurse63,"The items I received are actually the medi bac wash which replaced the antibac wash in the dermalogica line. The box and the description say anti bac. Its not bad, I just happen to like the original antibac better."
1,Very Disappointed,"The toaster looks great, but I think I got a klinker because it seems to toast in bagel mode even when I haven't selected that mode. I wanted a replacement, but Amazon won't have one for 3-5 weeks. So I guess I'll get a refund and try somebody else.Edited to add: Amazon's customer service is outstanding, as always, and I got the replacement quicker than originally promised. Unfortunately, the replacement has the same problem as the original, which tells me that it's a flaw in the product. So I'm definitely going with a different brand."
1,Terrible Toaster,This toaster is terrible! Although it looks nice it burns one side and dosen't cook the other side. Looks like some of the heating elements don't light up to toast the bread. Tried contacting Black & Decker only to be left on hold or hung up on.
4,love lost love saved,It was worth buying despite the typical tragic ending of a young persons life over how prehistoric out society is breeding intolerance. The actors were awesome. The story line didn't leave you lost but instead drawn in. I guess you could say it had a happy ending just not the one you root for through the entire movie which is a flash back. Can't help watching more than once.
5,Love has no bondaries,"This movie is extremely moving. It's about two young high school guys that have nothing in common or do they. One is a swimmer and one is a talented artist. They connect in a surprising way. I've seen the movie many times and finally decided to purchase it. If your like me, once you've seen it you'll want to see it again and again."
4,Watercolors,"I gave this rating because the movie was beautiful.I liked this movie because it was a love story between the two main characters, Danny and Carter. There were some parts I didn't like, but most of it I did. I don't want to ruin the movie for anybody so I won't list the scenes here. The ending left me with a bittersweet feeling as I wept.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story. I will watch this one again with tissues close by. :)"
3,Sweet..,"Its a sweet movie.. I actually liked the two main characters together, even though Carter was trying to be a tough guy..***SPOILER***But seriosuly? Why did Carter have to have an ending like that? So unfair.. I'm always down for a good HEA, and I definitely didnt get that here.. :o(But still a sweet coming-of-age love story.."
3,tragic,"the angst of youth. this story is, unfotunately, a common one. gay boy meets straight boy. gay boy falls hopelessly in love. straight boy is afraid of his feelings. both boys end up shattered."
2,Hot gay movie ? NO,"This movie, like so many other gay movies are very poor. The reason ? They are low budget movies.....Story is bad, Filming is bad, Acting is bad. So save your money and buy a great Gay movie called, ""A Time To Leave""."
2,"Started out good, went downhill FAST","The first half of the film is really good, then it goes downhill fast, and by the end I didn't merely dislike it, I hated it. It has a terrible ending. Whoever wrote this, thanks a lot. Don't put yourself through it."
4,Complete Diving Manual Review,Good manual for those who are interested in knowing more about scuba diving and those currently taking classes to get certified as divers. Clear information accompanied by good photos.
5,Military Radical,"De Saxe wrote this book as a protest and a call for reform. ""War,"" he wrote, ""is a science covered with shadows in whose obscurity one cannot move with an assured step."" He called for reforms in organization, discipline and strategy required to build effective armies. De Saxe is one of the great links between Vegetius and Napoleon. Many of his ideas now commonplace, were considered absurd in his own time. No one can understand the evolution of armies who has not read his works.From the introduction of ""My Reveries Upon the Art of War"
4,Loacker Blackcurrant Quadratini 7.74 oz (220 g),"They make great snacks. Regretfully, they are not widely available without buying in case lots. I ordered two bags, they were listed as being in stock, but I only received one. I was billed for both, complained several times about no refund or 2nd bag,but never received a reply. I'm hostile."
4,Fun Quick Read,"A very quick read about letter writing penned by Carroll at the end of the 19th century that is in many ways just as relevant to e-mail correspondence in contemporary times. The reproduction of his letter registry is not quite clear in the Kindle edition, but that chapter is the least entertaining of the five. Carroll adds a bit of wit and valuable commentary about the etiquette of interactions in general (beyond written correspondence) which make this read well worth the 10-20 minutes you'll invest."
5,This is a great song.it makes you wanna get up and dance.,"Monifa has a beautiful voice and I love this song.I want to dance when it comes on, no matter where I am."
4,ariel sleeping bag,"The sleeping bag received was not the sleeping bag pictured, but I kept it anyway"
2,It was so messed up ....,"This thing came to me in such poor shape, i spent more on fixing this thing than it was worth, i sould have sent it backbut took the time to fix it and with all that said i now have a nice wing but at a cost about 600.00......"
4,Music fan from Ca. U.S.A.,"After having listened to allof Immortal's albums except for Pure Holocaust, Diabolicalis their slowest album. But it is still grim, raw, and powerful early Immortal. The vocals kind of sound like Darkthrone's Fenris to me, but the melodies are much more heavier than Darkthrone. I have only been listening to B.M. for a month, but I'm totally hooked. This album I definitely recommend for any B.M. fan."
5,The Truth,"Don Pullen was one of the unsung original masters of jazz piano. This collection exemplifies his incredible skill, originality, intensity, and emotion. At times, he appears to be all over the place, while never losing sight of thematic and rhythmic imperatives.George Adams, on tenor and flute, which isn't mentioned in the liner notes, is even more unsung than Pullen. This is unfortunate because he too is a master at his trade who has gotten very little attention. Listen closely and you will witness some work of true brilliance.The cuts involving Gary Peacock on bass are really of interest. Where Pullen is at times flying across the keys in, seemingly, all directions, such as on Reap the Whirlwind, Peacock is like a rock, grounding everything with a steady, firm line. He really brings it all together.Don Pullen cds were, for a long time, very hard to come-by. Mosaic has, once again, done itself proud by releasing some incredibe, heretofore difficult to find musical gems in this collection."
3,Rhodochrosite Pendant,"While the peridot, amethyst, and silverwork were exceptional, the center stone being described as ""Intense Pink Wavey Banded Rhodochrosite"" is very misleading. The stone is of high quality but the presence of ""Intense Pink"" color is virtually non-existant. This piece was primarily brown and red with small pink banding in the center of of the stone."
1,Poor Quality,"These shoes are not the quality Italian made Bostonians like the pair I own. In fact, the Italian made Bostonians are the most comfortable dress shoe I've owned. This model I bought from Amazon is made in China and is of poor quality. Thought I was getting a great deal, but ended up with a shoe that will probably be donated to Goodwill. You have to be careful, apparently many brands are using different materials and manufacturing methods under the same brand name. Amazon doesn't state that the shoe isn't the quality Italian shoe the brand is known for."
1,If Krick Says it...It Must Be a Lie...,I am dumbfounded that anyone exists that believes these essays are well-researched and informative. The sources that Mr. Krick uses to found his impression of General Longstreet have been proven to be absolutely false and a premeditated smear campaign to ruin the man who was Second-in-Command of the Army of Northern Virginia and RANKED Gen. Jackson. Pure Lost Cause mythology. I can't imagine what would possess a man to slander a person he never met so badly. Very unprofessional and disrespectful to Robert E. Lee's memory too. Readers: do not waste your money on this. It is BADLY researched and unsubstanciated nonsense.
5,devotion by Warren Hill,"Devotion by Warren Hill is a great CD and was received within a few days of purchase. I would recommend this to everyone,it was a new CD in perfect condition."
1,Too cool - an emotional void,"He's a good player but favours a funk sound with a lot of echo which makes the tunes sound edgy at best and unlistenably shrill at worst. Track 5 (vocal) is a very ordinary song. And why on earth would you cover ""I Still Believe In You""? Mitch Malloy sure ain't no Vince Gill."
4,excellent product,"Have used the vest on a yellow lab hunting pheasant and river doves for two years, on many tough areas. It has held up well, although barbed wire is not friend. I will order the larger size as my dog is at the upper end of the sizing and the arm openings will rub. It has done a good job of protection and is not too hot for early season hunting."
2,Eight of Swords- No thank you.,"As a professional Tarot Card reader I wanted this book to be great, as a person who enjoys reading, I wanted it to be great. You can't always get what you want. Could not care about the Warren Ritter. Gald I did not pay full price for this book. I wish he had made WR a palm reader, anything but a Tarot reader please.www.prudencetheriault.com"
2,Disappointing,"Easy reading but ultimately not satisfying. The central character wasn't very appealing, and acted like a jerk a lot of the time (he's 50-something and complimented himself for restraint in not having sex with an underage teenage girl; plus his interactions with police were pretty juvenile). Book was too long for the subject matter with a few too many side trips down memory lane. It gave a little detail about tarot cards, but so does Wikipedia. Not recommended."
4,The cards are favorable,"Skibbins has created a very interesting collection of characters in his debut mystery. The very accurate portrayal of Berkeley and the Bay Area, adds an atmosphere that greatly enhances the story. In general, I am not a fan of glorifying those who have broken the law, and I do feel the premise of Warren's becoming involved was a bit weak. What really makes the story work is the characters, good suspense and, at the end, Warren's acknowledgement of what his life and actions has cost him. I ended up caring about Warren and want to see where his life goes from here. I know I'll be back for the next book. This is a very good debut."
5,Revelations,"Whoa! This book was excellent. You find out some amazing stuff that I didn`t see coming. The plot is excellent with twists and turns. Some predictable, some aren`t. Get this book and the ones before it. Also try out the Jedi Apprentice series."
3,Creepy low budget,"This movie is worth the sitting...it's creepy and effective, how ever flawed.It succeeds in the first half, by creating a foreboding, unpredictable atmosphere. You really aren't sure where the movie will be going. If the movie had kept up this atmosphere and pace, I would have given it 5 stars.... but then things change.The setting moves to a hospital, and there the atmosphere, and the story drops in quality. The main character looses focus, and his motivations and actions don't really seem to fit. He is rescued from the hospital in a poor escape scene, driven to a warehouse, and just walks away. The ending is him driving hours away to see his Mom, but, if the Bryans were as big a cult as the earlier part of the movie implied, how was he able to drive so far without stopping for gas or being seen?I was also disappointed by the commentary. It wasn't very informative, and is cut short by a shooting by a Bryan cult follower. It's pretty much a self-love fest for Seth Landau."
1,They should pay you to watch this.,"Even bryan would be enbarrassed.This movie is another one of the ""handy cam"" movies with forced, bad acting and is just plain sleep inducing. A good movie could be made from this story, but this isn't it. In short, it's not worth the time and money.They made me put a star rating.The real star rating is:Minus 5 stars!"
1,WOW...What a snooze fest!,"I rented this mainly because I saw the introduction to the film by Tony Todd. He talked about how if you are easily scared or have any kind of condition then you shouldn't watch the ""found footage"" due to its graphic content. He forgot to mention the extreme danger you would also be in of BEING BORED TO DEATH!Wow, this was really bad. The movie drones on from one uninspired scene to the next, with an abrupt and utterly stupid ending. Not even Tiffany Shepis (whom I am a fan of) could save this.If you are gonna watch this, then I suggest some No-Doz would be in order."
2,Good talent and a storyline with potential wasted!!,This movie could have been good but the fact that it shows and tells nothing of what happens completely kills it. Oh and for anyone interested in this cuz of Tony Todd (Candyman) he only does an intro so it aint worth the watch.
3,"Good idea, poor quality of materials","My son has a lot of fun with it but as it happens with bandai, materials are poor quality"
3,Pink Brass,"The toy was ok,my son played with it for a short time. The voice changer aspect is a lot of fun but I don't think the toy will hold older children's attention for long. It is not well made and the parts broke with in a month. I would invest in a better made Ben 10 toy."
2,Not Worth It,This toy isn't worth two dollars all the voices sound the same it doesn't even stay on my five year old's face everything about it is as cheap as could be.
3,This book grew on me,"This book grew on me; I enjoyed Russ's narrative voice even if I found his clichés tiresome. I also liked the plot of this book, I found the camp setting inviting. But several things will keep my score low; firstly the writing is at times sub par and overly cliché. The thematic issues in the book are well done but I can not imagine these topics having a general readership, this book will appeal to girls and social outcasts, but will not appeal to most boys. Some boys particularly during adolescence are not very tolerant to other sexual identities so I can not imagine them sitting down to read about book about a gay Protagonists unless that character was more like Web and less like Russ or Otto. As much as I did enjoy this book, it's just not good enough. I would rate it has a high school only for it's mature sexual sequences, but the writing is less than a middle school level."
4,Great Sequel!,"I just finished The Order of the Poison Oak. I read and fell in love with Geography Club last summer, and was eagerly awaiting the 2nd installment of the story. (Brent's also planning another 2 books, but it looks like we'll have to wait 2 more years for those).The action in the book moves along at a pretty fast pace. It's good to see the characters in a different setting then we left them in Geography Club, and to see them dealing with new issues."
4,Order of the poison oak,"I enjoyed reading the Order of the Poison Oak because there is a lot of excitement but it's realistic. It shows that even if you are different than most people there are still those that care about you, all you have to do is find them. It also shows that if one of your friends says they are going out with someone you like you should believe your friend no matter how much you don't want to and be loyal to them no matter what. I also enjoyed the Indian legend told by Russ in the story. you can learn a lot from this book."
3,An Improved Sequel,This book is better than GEOGRAPHY CLUB - there is more detail and more character development.. but not a whole heck of a lot more. There is still room for better images and better emotion. I don't feel like I got to experience Brent's full vision of this work because there wasn't enough depth. Each character get's a little part and just when you get interested it's over and on to something else. I bought all Brent's books. I hope he grows as a writer..
2,anything but subtle,"Unfortunately, this book is just way too obvious. The art of subtlety has been apparently lost on Hartinger, as the prequel to this book suffers from the same defect. For some reason, Hartinger feels the need to spell out *every single thing* for us readers, as if he doesn't trust us to analyze or critique things on our own (or maybe he just doesn't want us to come up with a ""reading"" different from what he intended?). I don't know his reasons and it doesn't really matter, because the end result would be just as irritating whatever way you cut it. The writing is too heavyhanded and the same goes for the symbolism and metaphors. Many of the characters are mere caricatures (I pretty much predicted Ian and Em's character arcs from the beginning)."
2,eh,"eh. i was dying to read this after geography club (that book rocks) but this one....like i said...eh. it was campy. sigh. i guess campy is is a bad metaphor considering that we are talking about gay kids at camp, but i can't think of a better one. the only good part was the love triangle between russel, min and a bisexual fellow camp counselor.the burn victim metephors were too much. i mean, come on...burn victims facing a forest fire???? how imaginative. let me guess...russel saves the day? oh, that's right, i forgot, i read it."
4,If Jim Thompson were a woman...,"I enjoyed this book emensely. It was nice to see a novel noir a la Jim Thompson/ James Cain written from the view point of a woman (and written by a woman) and be as dark, sleazy, and ballsy as those writers. This one is an incredible ride through the mind of an anti-herione and it's believible and unpredictable."
4,Thoroughly Twisted... I like it!! :),"Just a good simple read. Nothing too complicated. The relationships between the characters gets wild and twisted in this novel. The crass trashiness of the main character provides an interesting point of view... one of a decidedly sexual nature, but also one that shows her desperation for acceptance and love (although she goes about the wrong way of finding and securing it). It ends up being a bit predictable however"
2,Shallow Read,"I finished this novel in about 2 hours. It didn't require much thought process, didn't make you analyze the characters or events, it just droned on and on about sexual encounters and a few killings. I didn't finish it because it was that engrossing, it was more like turning each page just because I wanted it to end already. There was no development of any of the other characters except Sherry, which isn't that interesting of a character in the first place. The plot jumped around and in most times almost seemed forced. Sherry and Payne's relationship had no chemistry aside from sexual. How did they even manage to fall in ""love""? This book was predictable and felt like an old slice of bad pizza. You finish eating it simply because you are hungry."
1,Unbelievably bad,"I bought this book hoping for a quick beach diversion. I did not expect ""literature.""Nor did I expect constant gratuitous sex scenes, no plot, no character development, and shoddy writing and editing.Unfortunately, my expectations regarding literature were accurate, but my expectations regarding decent noir writing were not. Words truly cannot express how bad this book was. I bought it in paperback, could not really finish it (skimmed through, but it was always more of the same - a woman who has no impulse control, a man who is narcissistic to a degree unimaginable, and a ""plot"" that never even happened), and then literally threw it in the disposal bin. I would give it zero stars if I could.Do not buy this book. Ever."
1,Boring trash,"My husband loved this book and highly recommended it to be as a delightful romp. Not my experience. Not well written, repetitive sex/violence, not believable, not even entertaining. I threw in the trash can at the airport."
3,What a plot!....,"This book leaves you wondering what will happen next. You really feel Sherri's struggles with overcoming the mortal fact that she is, and always will be a ""bad girl"". My opinions of the characters were constantly changing. However, must Sherri have sex on every other page! It takes your interest somewhere else entirely."
1,Ugh.,"I found this book for $3, and I have to say, it could have been better spent. The dialogue is awful, the descriptions boring, and the sex scenes aren't even well-written. Blah blah, Sherri wants to have sex again, you'll get tired of it by the fourth chapter. I read the last 10 pages to friends as they sat and groaned. Parts of it are ok, I suggest if you really want to read it, make sure there's nothing better you could be doing with your time."
1,Vile is not a Genre,"Poorly written. Depressing, full of characters who are uninteresting and depraved. The book masquerades as literature -- and some of the reviews appear to agree. The book was lent to me and the time I spent on it was far too great of an investment. Find something else to read!"
2,quiet but flawed,"Does not keep my amd x2 4200+ cool. Good heatsinks typically utilize a smooth copper plate which makes contact with the CPU. Heatsinks and CPU surfaces should be as smooth as possible to maximize surface contact. Not only does this heatsink not have a copper plate, but it's surface is so rough, that it's no wonder I have to change my grease once a month. I'm actually planing on sanding / buffing the surface next time I have to pull it off. Not a quality product."
2,Way too loud,"Use it on a AMD Athlon 64 x2 4400+. Seems to keep the CPU cool, but is way to loud! Will switch to a passive cooler."
4,Noisy at first. Now it's almost silent.,"I bought this to replace the noisy 3-pin stock fan on my Socket AM2 system.All the reviews said this was a very quiet and affordable 3-pin fan, even at full load. I thought I would need a 4-pin CPU fan to utilize PWM fan control to keep things quiet, but decided to give this one a shot.Installation was very easy, especially if you're already familiar with installing CPU fans.Unfortunately, when I booted the system, it was rather noisy. The sound of plastic lightly hitting on something with the rotation of each fan blade at high speed.I unscrewed the fan from the heat-sink portion and punched the rotational fan portion into its fan-guard, in a frustrated attempt to locate the source of the sound (which was not visible with inspection).This maneuver completely removed the annoying sound, and now it's operating at near silence at full speed.I would have given this 5 stars if I didn't have the initial noise issue. Good fan. Much better than any stock fan."
3,OK when it starts,Fan is quiet and easy to install. Problem is that it doesnt always start first time and I have to help it start. After that it runs great. Not that impressed.
5,Leather Key Case,"I've had this leather key case for a couple of months now and am extremely please with the appearance and functionality of it. It has been designed to hold cash and a credit card as well as the keys. I've purchased other higher end cases before and they always seem to fail where the male part of key ring attaches to female metal strip of the case. It is too early to know whether that will happen with this one, but right now I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,"Attractive, Functional Key case","I had been looking for a key case to replace my Fossil key case, which had a problem keeping the keys attached to the case. I understood the key attachment mechanism that Fossil had used and knew that that was a bad design. I eliminated any key case that had that mechanism and shopped for a more secure one. This key case had not only a more secure key attachment mechanism, but also was a smaller size and made of Italian leather. I do not carry many keys (three at most), so this fits comfortably in my pocket. I'm not a coin purse person so I won't be using the coin purse feature. Of course, time will tell how well this key case holds up, but for now I am most pleased with this product."
5,Democracy works!,"I've been waiting for years for Michael Moore to write a sequel to the wonderful, hilarious ""Downsize This!"" and I thought I was going to have to wait a long time after I heard last summer that Harper Collins had put the book ""on hiatus."" That the book was even published is a victory for democracy. That the book is creating small riots across the country is a huge victory for those of us who believe that ""United We Stand"" doesn't mean we all have to think alike. My copy arrived yesterday and I haven't been able to put it down. Once again, Michael Moore speaks out for the thinking American! (...)"
3,Michael with a grain of salt.,"Michael offers a refreshing, alternate angle on happenings in your America, but do take with a grain of salt.Being a middle of the road Canadian, (a die hard liberal in U.S.)I still can find Michael very irritating. He suffers from the liberal malady of constantly whining and complaining for his lot in life and continually accentuating the negative, he though does redeem himself for offering some soulutions."
2,juvenille writing,"I bought this expecting to like it. I agree with much of his politics, I loved his ""no war"" message during the academy awards and in general agree with him. However, he sounds better in soundbites than in a book. His writing is juvenille/dumbed - down. Maybe he thinks everyone is stupid - and not just white men. While on the subject what's up with the retarded title. Maybe he feels guilty about being a white man and feels compeled to ""suck up"" to every non white male. The book would have been better in an essay or a long magazine article. But not much substance or credible facts backing his opinions."
4,You're enjoyment will depend on why you buy it...,"This book makes lots of assumptions and critisims about pretty much everything that happened during and shortly after the 2000 election. It dates itself a bit what with the events of the day, but also serves to remind us of how outraged we SHOULD have been about the events in our country during that time period and how liitle we did about it. It makes me realize how powerless we have allowed ourselves to become in our own country.I didn't buy this book to substantiate any of my political views, I bought it because I think Michael Moore is funny and I wish there were more people who weren't afraid to say what they think right or wrong, whether it goes against the grain or not.This book delivers. Minus one star because many of the conclusions drawn are unsubstantiated, but otherwise very entertaining."
1,It gets old and tired after the first couple of chapters,"I really enjoyed Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" and highly recommend the movie. Definitely one of the top five movies of the year. After watching the film, I was interested in reading his book. Unfortunately, it didn't have the same bite and zip as his film. The book is highly anti-Bush/Republican, which is fine, however his theories and thoughts on how to change the American way of life didn't offer any new insights. Most of his suggestions were ludicrous lists that were offered up for a chuckle, which quite frankly weren't even that funny. He does this in nearly every chapter and it loses it's humor. I found myself bored towards the middle of the book, although continued to read it to the end, hoping to read some of his wit that would make the whole book worth it. Oh well, it wasn't strenuous reading and thus eased my curiosity of his writing."
1,Well written but utterly wrong,"In this book you will find an entertaining and well written explanation of what's wrong with America. In short, Michael Moore thinks America is in a sorry condition because too many people actually believe in things like interpreting the consitution based on the original intent of the authors, the value of traditional values, the blessings of individual (rather than collective) liberty, and all the other factors that have made America a great nation. Mr Moore never seriously addresses these issues, preferring to make his case by character assaults instead. He may well be correct in some of his well written and engaging details, but he fails to see that order requires law, that liberty means inequality in economic outcome, and that the real source of our America's problems is a crisis of character fed by the leftist assault on our culture and institutions. Mr. Moore's book is another salvo in that assault, fired from the wrong side."
4,Just get by chapter 1,"In Michael Moore's newest book, ""Stupid White Men..."" he makes some excellent points about the current state of the American society, as long as you can hang in there through the first chapter. In Moore's first chapter he complains incessantly about how ""George Bush stole the election."" For someone who is so good at developing solutions to problems, I expected a little Moore intelligence in his beginning arguments. He seemed to have left out some clear facts about the presidential election, that would have provided a more balanced viewpoint. Once Moore makes it past his tirade, he becomes the writer/thinker that I respect and admire. His views on American society are poignant and thoroughly investigated. It is a good book, but could do without the whinning."
1,"racist , sexist book","If Moore disagrees with government policy, he should be intelligent and say what he disagrees with and why. But he is a hyprocrite who claims to detest racism and sexism, but is guilty of it in relying on race and gender for his insults (white men). If he checked his stupid anger, he'd see our administration had Karen Hughes, Condi Rice, Colin Powell -- not all white or all men. He is a lowbrow, hate-filled rabble-rouser in need of a kick in the butt."
2,***** Way to go Michael *****,"As a Lebanese citizen who is not much into politics, I saw the book with a friend so i took a peak on some of the contents inside. Couldn't wait for the next morning to buy me a copy. As a result, I finished reading it in three working days (It usually takes me at least 2-3 weeks to finish a book). Once you start with reading it, you can't stop. Stupid White Men is one of the most entertaining and full-of-facts book. It should be nominated ""book of the decade"". This book is a must-have in every library. If you haven't bought it, go ahead, do it immediatly"
1,Stupid White Author,"If you want to spend your time reading 277 pages of ranting and bitching about everything Michael Moore doesn't like then this is the book for you. It amazes me how one person can come up with so many different conspiracy theories from so many non-sources and wildly unbelievable ""facts"" that ultimately all end up to be aimed at him or his beliefs, especially when he doesn't get his way. He has obviously had some serious couch potato time but he has proven he should use some of that couch time for professional help to get over his paranoia and inflated self worth.A 1 Star rating is a gift for this book--Amazon needs to add 0 stars for anything penned by Michael Moore."
1,I bought this book and now I feel like a STUPID white man!!!,"I bought this book because I thought maybe Michael had something new to say and I was pretty fed up with the current administration.....I didn't think anyone could make Clinton look good. However, after purchasing this book I can see that Michael only wants to become the Rush Limbaugh of the Liberals., spouting the same old rhetoric as if there is a difference between the two parties. When will people wake up and see that the people running our country and corporate America today (both Republicans and Democrats) are nothing more than a bunch of greedy, self-serving, theiving, Nazi thugs."
4,This book definitely makes you think!,"After seeing a lecture by Michael Moore, I bought his signed book and was ready to read. I opened this book thinking that all my questions would be answered regarding the current political atmosphere using information that could be backed up. The info Mr. Moore provided was interesting, but the book is written in an almost ""tabloid"" fashion. I need facts. I rated this with 4 stars because the book does make you think. I do highly recommend reading it, but I would recommend going to one of Mr. Moore's lectures more."
2,"A Fun Read, a Few New Facts, Mostly Unsupported Propaganda","I agree with a lot of what Michael Moore has to say. However, this book does not present very much solid information. There is no foundation to support much of what he says. Also, it is hard to know exactly what Michael Moore writes to be funny and what is true. Does Michael Moore really believe that George W Bush is illiterate? I'm guessing no although he spends a while making a case for it.Bottom line: if you're a Michael Moore fan, you'll like it although it's not as good as his movies. Otherwise, read something else. Anything else."
1,Hateful dispiriting book,"One of those works where if you changed the word ""white"" to ""black"" or ""men"" to ""women"" it would generate the sense of outrage it deserves. A hateful, racist, sexist book. We can only wonder what causes someone to write something like this. If it is self-loathing, that's sad. If its just to make money, that's infinitely worse."
1,Stupid White Moore,"Where does this clown get his info? of course all lies, The sad thing is, some people believe this trashy novel.And I don't feel sorry for them, sheep must be lead."
1,DON'T LISTEN TO THIS LUNATIC,Michael Moore has undoubtedly attempted to dupe the American public once again by turning this country on a very good president...stop reading his stuff and expose him for the true liar he is...
3,The good and the not so good,"First the good stuff. Moore points out the need for business ownerers to pay their employees a living wage along with sick and retirement benefits. I stongly agree! This is just good business, and by ""good"" I mean the right thing to do as well as the profitable thing to do. That's right. It is more profitable, especially in the long run, to do what is right -to your employees, to all of the stakeholders that are a part of your business. (This is the main thrust of my book: ""The Constant-Sum Approach to Business Success"").As for the not so good stuff, Moore wants to blame President Bush for any and all of the bad things that that occurred since his election, including the stock market nose-dive. This is neither true, nor realistic. Moore's political bias sticks out like a sore thumb. His rationale for his claims is weak and unconvincing."
1,Stupid White Male Writer,"Remember those heady days, when you were a college freshmen, and you were being exposed to startling ideas and agendas? Then you probably recall how easy it was to blame all the world's ills on the shoulders of STupid White American Males. This was kind of revolutionary, you know? Feminists were good at this. So were stupid white liberal males. They thought they were really being daring. Most of us outgrew this embarassing phase. Michael Moore never did. He sounds a lot like fakey civil right activists who are also good at blaming Stupid White American Males for everything wrong with the world. If there's an earthquake, it's the fault of STupid White American Guys. Moore is more than repulsively hypocritical. He likes to project this naughty, shambling,good old boy, scruffy and impish. In real life, he lives in a penthouse apartment and has a chaffeured limousin at his beck and call. He's grown rich from Stupid White Book Buyers who can't tell when they've been suckered."
4,At last an honest American!,Michael accurately describes the condition of democracy in the U.S. and most of the western industrial world. The death of free-enterprise and its replacement by elitist corporatism has created this brave new world. This is the real axis of evil.Keep your stick on the ice Mike!
4,Quality silliness,"A great read for anyone who thinks they can accept the truth.And if you can't, I hope you read it anyway and blow a gasket.With that said, Michael Moore is shamelessly over the top, and as biased as is humanly possible. While he brings up excellent points, you're best off finding additional references for any topic or statistic that he brings up.The nice thing is that, for a firebrand-political-commentator, Moore isn't a ""hardline,"" ""tough,"" ""hardball""-playing jerk."
4,Read This Book.,"It's nice to know that people actually believe that ""baby bush"" is an .... Michael Moore's book had me nodding my head the entire time. This book is great. The author does not hide his opinion at all. In fact, he openly believes that George W. is an impostor and shouldn't be president. Parts of this book will make you angry. Not at the author, but at the incompitent morons who represent the American people. Thank God I'm Canadian."
4,Provocative,"Actually a comment rather than review. You should read this book and make your own decisions.Michael Moore triumphs again. It is a difficult time to speak your mind if you are critical of our ""American system"". Truth couched in irreverent humor is a hallmark of this book. Read it, laugh, be afraid and think, if you dare."
1,Mike is the S.W.M,The book begins with a rant and how he rants!!! His writing style is so irritating and idiotic you can feel your IQ drop down. Read it if you plan to lynch the author cos it would certainly put you in the mood.
1,Autobiography of Michael Moore=Self-Titled,"Usually, when someone has no point, or facts to back it up, he/she resorts to name-calling and emotion, as in the title. I watched Moore on Foxnews and his comment about Bush's approval rating, high at the time (yes, Moore was likely high from [stuff] at the time too).. his comment: ""Well, the pollsters are intimidated so they rate Bush highly.."" Such is his book, which I read recently. There are few facts or evidence for his points. It's written by an angry, bitter man, that much is evident. Moore would have had them recount ONLY Florida... and Democratic countires in FL at that. The hell with the rest of the nation and close-called states... so he thinks. Like I said, people resort to name-calling when they are out out of truths."
1,Autobiography?,"After reading this book, I'm suprised that Moore didn't save the title ""Stupid White Men"" for his autobiography. The book simply complains about everything, while offering no solutions to any of the presented problems, and only attempts to [fool] the reader into believing that the U.S. is the worst country in the world, inhabitated by the worst people in the world. Worse, his writing skills are ficticious at best."
2,"Funny, but racist","This perhaps autobiographical work by Moore is packed full of wonderful sarcasm and clever double entendres, but his arguments lack any proof or substance, and the book contains one factual error after another. More disturbing is Moore's bleak picture of White America which portrays whites as inherently evil and racist. One can't help but wonder if the author includes himself among this wretched group. For someone who views Americans as ""possibly the dumbest people on Earth"", it looks like Moore has found the perfect audience for his craft."
5,Great Stuff,"This book is a terrific commentary on many of the things that are wrong and stupid in America today. I encourage everyone to read it, even those folks who will vehemently disagree. I also give a '5-Star' rating to many of the hilarious comments on this site from right-wing folks looking to drag down the book's rating. Keep it up, guys!"
4,A Smart Book.,"""Stupid White Men"" is a smartly written book. Michael Moore of movie and television fame, is remarkably clever in his description of our current president as well as his colleagues. He does not restrict himself to denigrating the democrats. He does give fair and balance writing to the opposing parties as well. Moore is a talented man with a gift for gab, and he truly gets down to the meat of the matter with humor and good taste. ""Stupid White Men"" is a smart book."
3,Chips and Beer Politics,"If I wanted to convince someone that the country is headed in the wrong direction (and has been for ages), this is not the book I'd hand them. A highly emotional, frequently sloppy rant, it does sometimes hit the mark, but it more often resembles what one might hear in a barbershop full of liberal guys on speed. If there were still barbershops.It does demonstrate two things: 1) The difference between a leftist and a liberal, and 2) if you want a bestseller, you come across like a liberal version of Rush Limbaugh, armed with name calling and ridicule. The politics are different, but the techniques aren't.Given the availability of a lot of intelligent (not necessarily intellectual), similarly oriented books on the various subjects this one touches upon, it's telling that one by a clown gets the most readers.If Moore looked more presentable, he might get elected president. We're ready for someone like him."
3,Isn't any worse than Ann Coulter,"Frankly, after about 50 pages I found this book boring. I am not sure exactly why but it doesn't have the impact on me that the author intended. I believe the main reason is that although the author makes many legitimate points he cannot resist putting just enough of a twist on some of his information so that some of the truth is lost. This tends to negate his impact on me."
5,Absolute Brilliance!,"Stupid White Men, a work of comic and political genius by Michael Moore, exposes precisely what is slowly destroying our dear nation, while, at the same time, enlightening we, the citizens, on how to improve upon our situation. In other modern works centered around the state of the United States, fingers are merely pointed at the conservative, liberal, democratic, republican, or green party with vast hatred and a disregard for improvement. Blame will only send out nation further from success and happiness. On the other hand, Stupid White Men remains to be witty and wise, causing us to laugh and ponder at the same moment. It helps us use the divine right of democracy and citizenship against political corruption to find a way out of our national rut."
2,It's not funny and certainly not insightful,"When I read through ""Stupid White Men"" I kept on thinking, ""this can't be true,"" and I wasn't surprise to find that it isn't. Moore often misrepresents data throughout the book ... (it's easy to find out about on the web if you're interested). What makes me slightly sad is the number of reviews trying to present this book as an insightful piece of political analysis. This book egregiously fails in this aspect, as you have to have actual facts for political analysis and not submerge your writing in bombast and slogans.The only way this book could have redeemed itself was by being humorous. To me it was not, perhaps because I was so overwhelmed by Moore's shallowness and absense of truth. All so he can get his Marxist convictions across in the name of satire. The reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is that I can see why someone would find this funny (and, evidently, many people did). I, however, was not amused by Moore's misguided ramblings."
3,Biased,"There's some good information in here, and it serves as a very nice compendium of reasons to hate Bush and others in gov't now, but there's also a lot of misrepresented data. Moore, in many places, only presents the numbers from one side of an argument, therefore not painting a full picture. I think this may be partly due to the fact that many of his references are NY Times articles about studies, rather than going directly to the study."
3,"Brings up good points, still a tough read","I am not a huge Michael Moore fan, although I had enjoyed his documentaries, so I decided to check this out. I think that he does bring up some good points about the negatives of the Bush administration and the first chapter about the Florida recount is very entertaining. However, he continues on to detail all the woes of society as a whole. Some of his points are very valid (Our 'justice' system is atrocious, as seen by Illinois college students proving the complete innocence of 5 death row inmates in Illinois). However, at times he gets a little preachy and I was finding it harder to get through this book as it went on. I still feel that this is an important read, as it calls out for some changes that are sorely needed in this country, but there is way too much soapboxing to adequately get the point across."
4,A must read in addition to seeing Bowling for Columbine,"Michael Moore is an amazing guy. In this book he walks on ground that no one else dares to touch. I recently read it for the second time after seeing the film Bowling for Columbine in my local theatre, and just am amazed at how accurate he portrays our country. You have to have a lot of guts to do a lot of the things he does, and talk to a lot of the people he does. I sincerely hope people take what he has to say to heart, because as you look at the current state of the nation, his suggestions (although sometimes tounge-and-cheek) most likely would work."
3,Amusing at Best,"This book is classic Moore. Funny, sharp, and easy read and follow. I enjoyed much of the book, but found it to more entertaining than informational. ""Stupid White Men"" contains a number of scientific errors (example: information regarding Mad Cow disease) and should not be taken as truth verbatim. I also was unimpressed by any solutions Mr Moore offered besides the tired ""anyone but Bush & Co."" I would recommend ""Stupid White Men"" to others, but borrow it from a friend or the local the library and be sure to take it with a boulder of salt."
1,Babble,"Typical left wing BABBLE from the same school as James Carville and Paul Bagala, Moore just throws out idiotic charges with no facts to support him. But he's getting rich off the people who believe his B.S. This is a guy who loves the slimeball Clintons who nearly destroyed this country and saw nothing wrong with their sorrid perfomances and criminal acts-(oops sorry that was Ken Starrs fault). But unlike Clinton I think Moore inhaled too much. Buy a good book backed up with FACTS (SLANDER) a tool that Moore uses on every page of his hate filled book. My bird cage will not want for floor covering for awhile"
2,Not As Good As Downsize This...,"Having been a fan of Michael Moore's brand of political satire since first seeing Roger and Me, I had high expectations for his new book. This book has got to be on a par with Canadian Bacon as one of Moore's most insipid moments. Yes, George W. stole the election, but by surrounding himself with proven statesmen, he's acquitted himself far better than Android Al ever could. Unlike Downsize This..., there's plenty of passages in Stupid White Men...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation that just seem to ramble on without even a hint of sharp-edged wit or irony. Perhaps Mr. Moore should just consign himself to the fact that George W. is well on his way to a second term, and divert his attention elsewhere."
1,Stupid White Men,"As a boy of caucasion decent, I am offended by this ""man"". I am insulted by his premise, and the title as well. Michael Moore is obivously someone who hates this country and my suggestion would be to buy the book ""The Savage Nation"" by Michael Savage. Dr. Savage is truly a man who loves this country and supports the roots that our country was founded on.Michael Moore, deserves to have his book used for toilet paper."
1,"Rape of Nanking, anyone?","He LITERALLY says that white people are responsible for every bad thing in history. He blames them for slavery. Ha! It's true they did it, but they didn't invent it. It has gone on for thousands of years, and still goes on in some places, to much worse degrees and in larger numbers. And how about the Rape of Nanking? That is one of the most infamous slaughters in history (along with Tianemen Square). I'm glad I found the book ""Why the Lef Hates America"" by Daniel J. Flynn. The kind of people mentioned in that book fit the description of Michael Moore exactly. If he wants to ""Kill Whitey"", to quote one of his chapters, he should take a nice long walk off a really short pier, or go live in China. Whichever's worse."
1,Self Hating Liberal,"oh sure, it's ok to bash on white men ... how about a book on ""Lazy Black Men""? oh, you'd have Jesse Jackson infront of the publisher's house in no time. It's the usual socialist anti-american, anti-capitalist, anti-white, anti-male [stuff] - coming from a white american male who clearly wishes he were something else. It's the typical liberal attitude of despising society because it doesn't agree with him. That eternal whining, badmouthing, politically correct filth emanating from the far left is really sickening. How about writing something positive for a change. and - if it's really so horrible here, for god's sake, move to Canada or France."
1,Can One Man GET Any Dumber?,"If it were possible, I'd strongly encourage the makers of the film, DUMB & DUMBERER, to go back in time and cast Michael Moore in both roles.What I find interesting about Moore is that he's convinced that pounding his head against the wall works. It appears as if he honestly believes that, if he does it long enough and hard enough, society will eventually crumble and cower beneath what he perceives as his own gargantuan intellect ... basically just a wiseacre mind disguising Communist ideals.Still, the book would've worked if Moore had stuck to what he does best: stand-up comedy. He's downright funny when he needs to be, but, unlike the superb Dennis Miller, his words carry little weight when he's arguing the state of world affairs. Despite what he would have you believe, ""one man does not a democracy make,"" unless you're living on a very small island and willing to live by very limiting visions.This book is not intended for adults with a brain."
1,Oh please...,"Moore's a sharp guy - sharp enough to produce a biting documentary ""Bowling for Columbine"".I sometimes agree with what he says but this is not one of them.This is a terribly-written left-wing rant at best. Those who belong in the political left should enjoy this book, but as with any agenda-ridden books like these, not terribily accurate or entertaining. Blanket, emotional statements without fact-checking is everywhere, but that's his prerogative - this is a free country. As an Asian-American, I never could really understand some white men trashing their own so much - does that make them feel like they are better than the rest of the white men like Moore does?"
4,You need to like his way of thinking,"For Michael Moore fans, this book would be a no brainer. If you don't even slightly see his side of the story, then to pick this up would be like recommending the Bible to an atheist. Being a Michael Moore fan (it started with his documenatary, ""Roger and Me""), I found the book to be absolutely wonderful. The only hesitation that I have for giving the book 5 stars is that it is a difficult read. It helps if you are familiar with his voice and sense of phrasing, then, it's almost as though he is speaking to you. If you aren't familiar with Michael Moore, the data, statistics, and info that he provides could be a little overwhelming and seem like a text book. However, anyone who has seen his documentaries and love them will find this book a more pleasant read--if you want to give Michael Moore ""the author"" a try."
2,what a mess,"""these VWs are run by a computer system,and if the computer hasn't read any activitynamely, you turning it on and driving it everyday or so-then the computer assumes thebattery is dead or something, and just shutsdown the whole car.""This is from the preface. Let us hope to God,that Mr.Moore isn't this gullible or simple-mindedin real life. If he asserts this as true in thepreface, what are the chances of the rest of his information being any more factual? The absolute minimum that should berequired of any author, is that they at least pretend to check the accuracy of their information. This man has a very sloppymethod of data verification.I agree with him on some points, but, please -at least try topresent data that isn't absurd."
1,Stupid White Man,"Mr. Moore clearly shows he's WAY out of touch with the rest of the country. This book lacks all credibility from the get-go. Do not waste your money on this (or, for that matter, don't even waste your time reading it from the library)."
1,Hardly a reference piece,"His book, much like his ""documentary,"" takes facts and twists them to his own liking. It does not matter to Moore if one thing happened before another or in a different place, if tying the two together will make it seem like the government (especially republicans) are corrupt than so be it.To those who love this book, while it might make good reading, it is not a valid reference piece. Moore states many apparent facts but has little to no footnotes or endnotes, why is this?If you enjoy the rants of a Marxist, enjoy but if you want to be truly educated, look elsewhere."
5,"The Truth Hurts, Doesn't It?","Fantastic! Somebody finally has the balls to say what we all wish we had the nerve to say. Michael Moore tells it like it is, and the Repubs can't stand the heat, even though Moore beats up a few Dems to boot! (But we all know Repubs can only dish it out, they can't take it)> This book presents the sorry state of our nation and pulls no punches in letting us know who is at fault (including us!) and it should be required reading for anyone who cares about freedom, free speech, the people's will, and the truth."
5,Right on!,Michael Moore showed his brillance with Roger and Me. This is his best work since then. No one else has so eloquently spoken for the common man and woman.
5,"Michael, thank you! We needed this wake up call!","This book has me so fired up that I just convinced my boss to order 10 copies for the office - and I'm not finished - I am just getting started. I am seeing the light, and there are ""stupid white men"" in front of it!!The humorous way that Michael Moore delivers this information makes it easier to take in all the horrifying data about the corruption of the Bush Administration/Corporate America and its direct relation to our national and international dilemas right now. But let me warn you, after reading this book I am not able to go about living my life the same way...I am starting to question everything, and guess what I am finding out, so are a lot of other people."
4,An interesting polemic on the state of America,"There is a lot of logic i find very skewed int his book - especially parts about blacks and women. However, i will read these sections again and again, along with the others, to experience the insightful, thought-provoking writing Moore provides. There is so much in this book that provokes sharp intakes of breath - the stupidity and duplicity in 'the system' in the US today is really breathtaking.This is a polemic, but Moore never pretends to be writing anything other than a book from his own point of view (and a well researched book at that). I wish everyone (especially every American) would read this book - even if they didn't agree with everything (or anything) Moore has to say, it might make them think. Definately had that effect on me."
3,It was O.K,"Poliitcally I consider myself an Independent. However Mike Moore does do a lot in this book that makes you think and in some places the book is quite funny(particularly his comments on the election of 2000).I really liked this book a lot but there were a few things that really annoyed me1. Moore's constant reference to Al Gore as ""president in exile"". Ok we all know the election of 2000 got ugly but here is a news flash for all of you GORE CHEATED TOO and if he had gotten an edge... oh well just go out and vote in '04 and we will not have this problem.2. Some of you people in your reviews treat Moore like he is a saint or some kind of poor man's hero, he's not just a guy with a lot of common sense.Overall-Like I said this made me think, I'll go get his new book as well"
5,Speaking the truth,"A friend of mine send me this book two days ago. On receiving it, I was full of skepticism - ""stupid white man"", what could it possibly be worth? I was wrong. This is a truly honest to goodness book, coming straight from the gut from a person with conscience. What he said is so true.I see some comments in this book review falting Michael Moore for not backing up with facts and statistics. This is my view: I am a well read person, and I can categorically say that the figures provided in his book (though no footnotes) is accurate. There are those who complain that he is a leftwing guy who spews venom. I have this to say. Aren't truth always painful to swallow?Read this book. It will make you a better person. And the world a better world."
5,Could not put it down!!!,"I could not put this book down. Regardless of your political views, this is a fun book to read. It will either make you say ""Yeah, that's right!!!"" or say ""What the heck is he talking about?"" Not being American, I found myself on both sides throughout the book, and anytime a book can make you feel that range of emotions, then I feel it's doing a great job. You may not agree with everything in this book, but that would be pretty boring if you did. (Why bother to read if you agree with everything, you may as well write your own book.)Regarding the review looking for more sources, Mr. Moore backs up his statement with several pages of sources and acknowledgements starting on page 257."
2,Very annoying delivery....,"I did not purchase this book with preconceived notions and really thought it would be entertaining, maybe even insightful. I was wrong. Mr. Moore comes across as an pseudo-intellectual malcontent who whines about the ""State of the Nation"", then offers up a ridiculous way to correct his perceived ills. I could understand this drivel if he had any comedic ability, but unfortunately he doesn't and his ""punchlines"" are highly predictable. A very entertaining book for an uninformed person with an IQ under 100...Even while leaning towards liberalism, I find very few redeeming qualities in this book. It has its moments, hence the 2 stars, but not enough to carry it. Save your money or borrow it from that politically correct friend who raves about it..."
4,Informative and entertaining,"Michael Moore seems to be a sincere advocate for the poor and disenfranchised and Stupid White Men makes some really important points and asks some hard questions that seem to go unanswered by those in power. Michael Moore uses wit and a touch of sarcasm to analyze the politics and thinking process guiding the United States today and, with the exception of Chapter 7 (The End of Men), his book touches serious issues, never loosing his sense of humor in the process. He exposes the hypocrisy of politicians and explains very clearly why paying a decent wage makes sense for us all.Even if one doesn't agree with everything he says or his way of saying it, you gotta admit he makes any reasonably intelligent person think. And Michael's heart is in the right place.He also bravely admits his weak moments in life such as when he met Jeb Bush or when he was fired by Ralph Nader. Yet he never held a grudge against Nader whom he later backed for president.Overall, a very good book."
1,Stop the complaining and insinuations already...,"What I've always liked about Michael Moore's work in film and television is how he can take up a single cause, and keep an audience captivated about. In this book, he merely meanders from one point to another, often piecing together half truths and insinuations to make it out like he is taking the moral high ground. I suspect he is trying to be funny, but there are many out there who will consider his past record of accurate research, and take some of the conclusions he reaches with faulty logic as gospel. Frankly, that scares me. Now I can't tell if he has always been full of it, or if books simply are not his media."
5,Educational in a funny way,"Reading the book was quite interesting. It was very educational and it was brought in a nice funny way. Highly recommended, even for people who are not into politics."
2,Full of stereotypes and half-truths,"Moore seems bent on making broad generalizations about large segments of the American public, particularly if they're the conservative, church-going type. I did gain a few grains of grudging respect for him: he's an eagle scout and believes in getting involved instead of just complaining. The book is funny in parts, but mostly derisive humor, which is annoying from the left and right. And don't buy the line that this book isn't liberal and hard core left. When Moore is criticizing Clinton et al, it's for not being a true lefty. Interesting book, but I wouldn't use it as a solid argument for the left."
4,decent buy,"I'd first like to say that when reviewing a book, you must first read it and then comment about it, rather than go on a tirade about the author's weight. The facts are certainly leading, as you will find in ANY partisan book. That does not necessarily discredit the research, most of which is quite disturbing. For example, Moore higlights the disenfranchisement of a great many black voters in Florida who were wrongly identified as felons in the 2000 general election. I found it to be a quick read, but certainly worth the purchase."
1,"Falsehood, hot air, and bile - typical Liberal bilge","In addition to the regular bile and juvenile blabber, this book is full of intentional faslehood.In his book, he states that five-sixths of the U.S. defense budget in 2001 went toward the construction of a single type of plane and that two-thirds of the $190 million that President Bush raised in his 2000 campaign came from just over 700 individuals, a preposterous assertion given that the limit for individual contributions at the time was $1,000.When CNN's Lou Dobbs asked Mr. Moore about his inaccuracies, he shrugged off the question. ""You know, look, this is a book of political humor. So, I mean, I don't respond to that sort of stuff, you know,"" he said.""Glaring inaccuracies?"" Mr. Dobbs said.""No, I don't. Why should I? How can there be inaccuracy in comedy?""In other words - the only way to make his point is to lie.What more do you need?"
3,Okay,"I am German....I was born there and I've lived there all my life. So maybe I am not the one you can trust when it comes to books about politics in the US. But trust me, this one is highly entertaining and funny, but it doesn't provide ANY helpful information...except that all Republicans and Democrats are corrupt. It seems as if there were two people in the US who are not corrupt and not bad - Moore himself and Ralph Nader (I guess less than 1% of all Europeans know Nader and I bet it's not that different in the US). Moore also could have titled this book ""No matter what happened...blame it on the Republicans""."
1,What a waste of time,Poor research. Writing to make his points not from facts. Shame on you Michael Moore.
4,Sad but True,"Stupid White Men is a book most of us think about but don't have the courage to write. It's funny, sad, some of it was an ""AHA"" for me. Much of the content in this book I have observed in my life. His comments on environmental issues hit a chord because it is high time we recognize that we are destroying the earth and the environment. Alot I am sure, many of us have never considered. Just our basic greediness....bigger and BIGGER houses and SUVs which eat up our resources. This is a book that will make you think and help you too see things beyond just ourselves...next time you buy gas for your car, think of the MTBEs that can potentially destroy the water supply. Buy 76 gas...more expensive but less toxic to the planet. Mr. Moore makes good points which some may find offensive, but have an open mind and learn from it and develop and more conscious way of thinking and doing things. Wake Up!"
1,Bigotry,"The title of this book is oddly familiar and close to the original title of Mein Kampf, prior to the editor having the good sense to change it. As for the author of this poorly researched dud, the title says more about him than anything, with the book merely a projection of his own psychosis. Hardly an authority. Save your change and think for yourself."
2,Falls well below expectations,"I consider ""Downsize This"" on a level with liberal rants like ""We're Right And They're Wrong!"" by James Carville and ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot"" by Al Franken. These three books were funny, informative, and allowed a bleeding-heart like me feel good about being a liberal again. ""Stupid White Men"" falls well below that level. While Mr. Moore hits the mark discussing the 2000 election, it seems that he's run out of things to talk about. His chapter arguing that women would be better off without men and the chapter that blames every African-American problem on white men like me, seem to be based on small ideas with merit. Unfortunately, the author expounds on these topics and exaggerates his points so far that they undermine his credibility. I'm so disappointed with this book, I'm not sure I will ever finish it."
1,What a hypocrite,"Here is a guy with marginal talent who is making a ton of money, and he has the gall to diss the same system that is paying him large.I notice that his stuff is copyrighted. Hey Mike. Power to the people. Let 'em copy off your book and distribute it for free!Read about your little incident in Britain. Weren't getting enough money there, so you went into a tizzy.Your theme in this book is right in one respect. There is a lot of injustice in this world. One of them is that you are a best-selling film maker/author."
1,I wish I could get my money back.,"I could not get through this book. The fact that they did'nt want to publish it after 9/11 should of made Mr. Moore think.It is so anti-American and, in a twisted way racist, that I put it in the garbage. If it was possible I would demand my money back from Mr. Moore."
2,Why is it a bestseller?,"That is the question that it should be asked.Filled with generalities, embezzled statistics, circular references and logic borrowed from The Simpsons.If the author really thought that Bush is the greater evil, he shouldn't help the cause by voting Nader and taking votes from Gore.Can't believe the author made milions writing smtg like this but then again it won't be the first time."
1,Scary!,"Many years ago, I enjoyed some of Moore's work. But this time, I'm sorry this guy got my money. I had no idea any human being could be so narrow-minded and so full of himself. But, at least I have a better idea of how this kind of people ""think."" If he can sway even a dozen voters, this country's gonna be a much worse place to raise a family than it already is."
1,The Book is written by a stupid for stupid people.,"I am also a very open mind when it comes to politics but this book it's stupid.He has no brain and I wonder who published this garbage. Money I suppose, because it is in faction to be against the USA and President Bush."
1,Only one word needed to describe this book...,"HORRIBLE! It is a shame that this country is being brainwashed by this insane left wing fanatic. I can't wait for Bush to win the 2004 election so I can rub it in his face that he is a lying, manipulative extremist (ironically, what he ""claims"" Bush is) out to destroy everything that makes America America. Don't buy this garbage and support this nut. Thank God, I didn't (think library)."
1,Liberal polemics,"One would think from the title that this is an autobiogrphy. It should have been. The argumentations presented are self-contradictory, as they assume some standard of values while all the while rejecting the world-view that provides for the preconditions of rationally justifying said values. Moore offers arbitrary opinions predicated on his personal predilections. If one is looking for objective journalism, look elsewhere; otherwise this is moore(pun intended) liberal emotivism, sans substance."
1,Pathetic,"Being an independent in politics, I add volumes to my library each year, from both the left and right. Moore is just taking pot shots in the dark, and coming up empty. This book is a good one to buy if you plan on having something to sell and lose $ on an online auction."
3,A Comedy of Errors,"While reading the introduction to ""Stupid White Men..."" I thought the book was supposed to be a comedy. Then after beginning chapter one, I quickly discovered that these are his actual views. (And apparently shared by several readers) I encourage every American to read this book -don't buy it, don't support him, but check it out of a library- and to do their own research before believing any one source. Don't just take him for his word, do the research yourself. He makes some pretty harsh claims for Bush, including he ruined the economy (While ignoring the fact that the recession had begun a couple of months before Bush was elected.) So check it out, read it, just don't be like sheep, believing every thing told to you from every psyco-extreamist who writes a book.I give it 3 stars; because, I have to admit, it was entertaining."
3,"Good read, doesnt let facts get in his way.","The book was an easy read. He kind of glosses some facts that he doesn't agree with (totally ignores others). Gun control, Automobiles, how he was made by his sisters and mother as a kid to do the ""womans work"" (his words not mine). You get the idea. I read the book, took a couple hours, gave me something to talk about for a few days. Personally I prefer to check a book like this out of the library and buy something a little more substantive and based on real facts."
2,"Excellent Facts, Distateful Style","I was very pleasantly surprised with all of Mr. Moores documentation. I think he did a great job on that, but must the delivery be so crude. I got the sense that Mr. Moore's ego is more important to him than the facts he is writing about. I do not consider him one bit funny. He merely detracts from some very important issues."
1,Michael Moore Stupid White Men,"The lowest possible form of humor, gender bashing, people bashing, culture bashing, all I suspect to raise his sense of self-esteem, which must be extremly low. Clearly a person who doesn't understand the concept of cultural tolerance, if you don't fit his mold of humanity you are on his bashing list."
1,Sadly Misguided,"Being a huge fan of Michael Moore, and a proudly independent voter, I was nonetheless disappointed with this book, and must vehemently disagree with the positions taken. This respectable director has unfortunately fallen prey to the one-sided political view of a left-wing Hollywood crowd. Those who would cheer upon reading these pages are nothing less than ignorant of both the vision of the current administration and the blatant hypocrisy of liberal American politics. The bottom line is that Mr. Moore does not correctly portray American issues, neither in domestic nor world affairs. This reviewer hopes that this author will soon see the forest for the trees, and honestly use his given talents as a tool for a better world. America deserves better, and Michael Moore possesses the talent to provide."
1,Stupid White Men,"You would have to be very desperate to sit and read this book, willingly. I found watching ice melt off the trees more interesting. I do enjoy light hearted reading, unfortunately this is light headed. You don't have to be a republican to dislike this book even I had a hard time with it. One of my ""Stupid White Men"" friends thought I would like it. The only part I liked about it was it was given to me so I don't feel bad about tossing it. I just might keep it in case someone irritates me, I'll give it to them."
3,OK But Why Stay?,"Moore makes a number of good points with which I agree. But for all it's faults America also has many pluses. If Moore (or anyone) wants a socialist paradise I would suggest anyone of the Scandinavian countries. If one wants more open space and less urban sprawl then Canada would be a good choice. If that's too cold then sunny Australia might work. If the US is too guache with too many Philistines then there is always France. See that's the best thing for Mr. Moore; he can leave if the US is really that bad. Somehow, I think he'll stay,"
4,Wake-Up America!,"I truly enjoyed reading Michael Moore's recent book and am thrilled to see how long it has lasted on the Best Seller's lists. It certainly says something about George W.'s true support. Moore does an excellent job of gleefully exposing the corruption fueled by corporate greed in our present political system. Most importantly, Moore offers inspiration for the common citizen to take charge and make changes. A good example of two citizens who took heed of Mr. Moore's message is the authors of ""Be Careful Who You SLAPP."" That is an incredible story of two ""little guys"" who struggled to expose corporate corruption and abuse of the legal system in the heart of Silicon Valley. If you liked ""Stupid White Men"" for its battle cry against abuse of our fine legal system, you will love ""Be Careful Who you SLAPP,"" the story of two individuals who took charge of their own struggle for Constitutional rights against the onslaught of a corporate abuse."
5,The right is mad because the right is wrong,"this book was one great book. i know all you ulta-conservatives would want to start a good old fashioned BBQ but guess what this book IS great but there are a whole lot more out there that are better and with a lot of factual insight this book did not provide. of course for the rookies, you should just start of with either howard zinn or noam chomsky (8th most quoted person of all time). after that go into specifics. we wave the flag of freedom as we conquor and invade."
3,An interesting read,"I found this book to be quite entertaining. However, it&#65533;s hard to tell what it is beyond that. Moore does an excellent job of pointing out the flaws of the American people, striking down everything from the 2000 election to our sad attempts at recycling. He states that there are more problems to this country&#65533;problems that have been around for many years&#65533;than just our current president. However, it is rather hard to take him seriously. Moore takes a very humorous approach to the issues (he has a section titled ""How Men Can Avoid Extinction""), such that it is often easy to forget that he actually has facts to back up his points. I think it&#65533;s interesting to see what he has to say, although I don't know how seriously this book should be taken. However, this book did make me aware of some of the issues that this country is faced with. Moore raises many issues that that make you think a little and they, if nothing else, make this book worthwhile to read."
3,"Entertaining, but thats about it.","Ok, this guy makes some good points, but he only looks at one side of things, if you WANT to look the the other side, you can find just as many disturbing facts (want being the key word, it is always easier to overlook your own flaws than realize them). With that said this was a very entertaining book, worth buying even if you disagree with with the author's viewpoints."
4,Great Book!,"...A fun read overall. Lots of insight, facts and humor. Every white person ought to at least read the chapter Kill Whitey."
5,Necessary reading,Anyone interested in the future of the USA should read this. It's funny and at times maddening.
1,Michael Moore is swayed by emotionalism,"Michael Moore as usual fills his material with emotionalism and ""feel good"" material, igoring facts and truths.Sometimes the truth hurts, and facts are just facts no matter how they make you feel.You time would be better spent watching day-time TV like the ""Lifetime"" channel for ""feel good"" material, and save your reading time for more worthy material."
1,Far left wing liberal!!,"Let me start by stating the simple facts: 1.) the media is by far a liberal organization. They will pull anything to attack Bush or the republicans. If the writer is correct about what he was saying: where in the world was the media? It seems to me they missed a huge story!! 2.) If Al Gore was all about protecting the rights of voters, Why didn't he say something? Or would it not be the right thing to do? Apparently Al Gore and the rest of the democrats let the voters down with their silence. Why are they not saying something now? This is nothing more than a lame attempt to degrade the President of the United States, and the Govenor of Florida. Not to mention try and divide our nation at a time when we should be pulling together as a nation behind our leader and looking to the future! I strongly urge all Americans not to buy this book and further divide our nation. Instead help bring us closer together to make it through such a hard time in our history."
1,Liberal Propaganda,"If Moore had his way, our country would be in total chaos. Let's ban everything and be socialists -great plan. Who needs military or a strong border patrol or strong free enterprise, right Michael?If Micael had his way, we'd all be sitting under trees smoking pot singing peace songs while terrorists infiltrate our country and undermine our whole way of life. Let's ban guns, but open the borders to everybody - it's no surprise he's a strong contributor to the Democratic party. Laughable and extremely short-sighted."
1,A waste of time,"I consider myself a moderate and this book was a total waste of time. It is such a hateful, anti-American book that I'm suprised that any so called American could produce such drivel. Don't read this..."
5,A MUST READ,"This book undoubtedly changed my life and made me look at things with an entirely different perspective. My priorities have changed and I certainly wasted no time joining Mike's Militia. I feel like I can be a better person and I have hope for this country by way of grassroots organizations. Even if you don't agree with his politics, he still comes across as an incredibly provocative personality and certainly a must read. Michael Moore is my favorite!! (And read Downsize This! also.)"
3,"Comment-Ci, Comment-Ca","Complete ignorance and elitism... a deadly combination is Micheal Moore's book. One could compare his hatred of Republicans to that of Nazi Germany: Micheal Moores loves to blame Republicans for all the world's troubles. I agree that if Micheal Moore truly didn't like captialism as much, why does he live in America? Sheer hypocrisy fills the pages of Micheal Moore's book.Nevertheless, the sheer wit and hiliarity of some of his claims are quite amusing...Yet, I still wonder... Big, Fat, White, Rich? Sound like someone we know? hmmm... also, where was Bill Clinton?"
5,Amazingly Socialist,This guy and all the sheep who read this garbage and let there eyes glaze over and nod there heads in agreement are going to be the death of freedom in this country....This book is just more liberal gutter wash.But don't get me wrong I'm not saying don't read this----read it and learn.
2,Yawn.,"After some predictable digs at the Florida election and Bush in general, this book loses all focus and humor. Moore seems like someone that has just discovered the internet and includes a lot of URLs for almost everything (including step ladders and vibrators.) The middle of the book is a vast waste of disconnected ideas that seem to be there only to increase the number of pages...you wonder how many stupid white men other than Moore had a hand in this work."
4,Genghis Khan Strikes Back,"Although Micheal Moore as usual raises some interesting and often disturbing points, his brash style and unwavering fanatacism are at many points in the book a turn-off. His scathing criticism of the administration masterfully inspires one to question the state of current affairs, and his obvious intelect combined with his down-to-earth bluntness create a symphonious juxtaposition that leaves the reader with a feeling of higher knowledge and a fair picture of what has happened to the American dream; yet it is hard to overlook his obvious bias against those with an unusually large amount of capitol in our society. Some of his most prominent ideas in the book are very plainly his own subjective opinions. Overall, however, I found the book quite stimulating and would recommend it to any who would live this country."
5,An important book,"Which is a satirical commentary on the white elite ruling America. He makes some valid points about the threats against American democracy. I can't help feeling he is a bit tough on the 'white men' though. Many of us do our best. As long as we're not acting in habitual ways, when our awareness has opened and we really do know better, the elite will be absolutely fien. And so will democracy, in the original Greek sense."
5,"Everything I wanted to say, but feared getting punched!","Thank you, Michael Moore. We have not flown a flag of Peace for fear of getting shot, and now you have the nation reeling. It feels good to finally be able to share thoughts with the Sleeping Giant - the real democrats and lovers of liberty. Let the name-calling and stone-throwing begin. Bring it on, you greedy power mongers. It's our war now. General Moore is on a roll."
2,Actually 2.5 stars,"Although I am anti-Bush and I generally agree with Moore's viewpoints, this book could have been a lot better. Instead of wasting pages making fun of republicans, Moore could have developed more meaningful arguments against the right-wing agenda. Although I think some of the stuff he says is amusing, we can't fight the right-wing by just going on about how stupid they are. We need something more substantial than that."
1,forget about political differences--Just a BAD book!,"Despite coming to some of the same conclusions that Moore does(albeit by different reasoning), this is just a BAD book. It really is not funny at all. ...It is nothing more than his opinions, but he is not humorous. I agree less with P.J. O'Rourke or Christopher Buckley politically but find them more enjoyable to read.Anyone can rant on without facts or logic and Moore does just this.I particularly find interesting how he categorizes all the ""bad guys""into White Men. When he comes up against women or non-Caucasianswho are on the ""wrong"" side, he names then ""Honorary White Men.""What a jerk!..."
2,Really not that good,"I agree with a fellow reviewer. Moore's movies are OK, but his humor doesn't translate well in book form. In fact, I found his jokes pretty tiring and annoying after a while. If I'm reading a book about politics, I want facts not a bunch of social commentary mixed in with lame jokes. I actually think Moore comes off a little hypocritical in the book. Frankly, this book was a struggle to finish. Good for a grade schooler or high school at best."
4,terrific,"Funny in a depressing way---if you liked TV nation or his movies, you'd like this book--you can hear Michael Moore's biting voice of sarcasm through the writing. The only downside is, he talks about a lot of issues I am already sadly aware of. There are some fresh points and he actually offers solutions to the problems instead of just pointing them out."
4,"you can deny the humor, but you can't deny the facts","It is essential that Americans, especially the middle and lower classes, be educated about what is happening in this country. The problem is this country just doesn't like reading. It is sad but true; to get news we turn on the corrupted CNN or ABC news and stare at Janet Jackson's breasts. Michael Moore is a great mediator between people and knowledge, a good character to present these facts. His clever film making and humorous writing is able to entertain this Ritalin driven nation whilst simultaneously educating them. Moore has in my personal opinion mastered the ability to manipulate his mediums to coerce people to follow him, the same way the media does. Moore has a specific agenda and he brilliantly thrives in his intent."
1,Hate and Ignorance from the mouth of a Fat Leftist,"It was difficult reading a book that attempted to demonize and alienate anyone whose views differ from his extreme liberal position. The book is an extension of the conspiracy theory campaign which attempts to paint anyone conservative view as stupid, self serving, racist. The book is a joke and would be more appropriately titled Stupid Fat Man."
3,I admire Michael Moore but the book is just OK,"The info in the book is great but I got tired of the humor especially because I found it ""pedestrian"" at times. I don't mean to sound like a snob but MY preference for this kind of material would be a little more serious in tone. You might want to check out Al Franken's book instead."
4,topics that needed to be stated,"Whether or not you agree with Moore's political viewpoints is irrelevant. The fact remains that this is a well-written, informed, and humorous piece of literature. Moore brings a new take to the issues which bombard us everyday, by providing new information in an often humorous format. This is an easily accessible read that will entertain you...you won't even realize that you are actually learning something in the process."
3,Thought provoking but sometimes too sensational,"I agree with many of Moore's points in this book. Our fair nation is being run down by a bunch of Yahoos. However, I did find that Moore takes the extreme route more often than not, even if it means broadcasting vast generalizations that may not always be true. In Chapter 4 he attacks the recycling industry, claiming that it is a sham industry, the materials all end up at the landfill and it is basically a waste of time to recycle. This may be true in the case Moore researched, but it is certainly not a sham industry and Moore should be ashamed of himself for encouraging so many folks to blow off this worthwhile endeavor. That having been said, the book is thought provoking and I think folks should read it just to get a sense of what might be going on in the oval office without the public's knowledge."
2,Glib,"This book has about 10-15 pages of useful information regarding government policy, contacting government officials, etc. However, the bulk of this book is a rant or whine that becomes tiresome. When MM is still writing quotations around the title ""President"" (referring to GW Bush) 150 pages into the book, it's time to let it go. His wit is short-lived and information too sporadic. Interesting how MM insults the rich - yet after movie and book deals, what is he?Somehow Michael Moore was able to drop out of college simply because he could not find a parking space. Many of us would enjoy that type of luxury.Buy this book used. There are many copies available. Do not keep this type of sub-par material on the NY Times Bestseller list any longer."
5,Judge for Yourself,"I wasn't thrilled with Moore's last book, ""Adventures in a TV Nation,"" mainly because it covered material already examined in his show. But ""Stupid White Men"" is fantastic. You will find intelligent discussion of the current state of affairs in this country, supported by facts and statistics. Yes, Moore leans far to the left of, well, just about everyone. And he makes no apologies for it, nor any secret of it. Any intelligent reader should be able to take that into consideration when reading the book. His arguments are, however, very persuasive. Moore's writing encourages the reader to think, not simply to accept what is spoon-fed by major media outlets and pundits."
1,The truly stupid are those that fall for this drivel!!!,"Moore only takes a break from distorting the truth, when he outright lies! Such as over 70% percent of one years defense budget went to build 1 plane!!! I'd love to list all the errors and lies that appear in this book but I'm limited to a 1,000 words. Do a Google news search on this topic and you'll find plenty of sources for the truth. Moore is the Paulie Shore of politics. He's a 1 trick pony, and the time to send that pony to the glue factory has long since passed."
1,Bad...Very Bad,"""Dude, where's my money""! I can't believe I wasted money on this book. I agree with a previous review. It is boreing, not funny or satirical. I think Michael Moore has become what he detests, a rich white male and is having trouble with his image. Attacking everything that is white, male and upscale is popular, but it all borders on class envy. Micheal Moore adds nothing new and if you find his humor funny...man it doesn't take much to make you laugh."
1,*Yawn*,"More propaghanda, nothing else. Reading this guy's dilusional ideas about our country is like choking down a 3 week old Dodger-dog. However it did come in handy when we got snowed in and ran out of toilet paper."
3,Good to exorcize your anger!!,"This is a good book to exorcize your anger, your lack of money. Because it gives you a target for such hatred: American corporative world and its dirty politicians. That's what's all about.I personally prefer Noam CHomsky books. But this one here is sometimes fun."
1,A man with answers or a big fat joke?,"At last, a Joseph Goebbles for the radical left's worn out propaganda! If white men are indeed stupid, then Moore is the standard. Don't waste your time on this book."
2,I'm not Stupid!,"To tell you the truth, I found this a bit of a disappointment. I really liked Bowling for Columbine but this comes off as a bit preachy. Moore tends to treat the reader as a child. We read too Mike and we have the ability to form our own opinions. He means well and the book does have good points. It is even entertaining in some bits. But he does contradict himself alot and also seems to need some kind of validation by the reader. Don't get me wrong, I think this guy has an important part in the greater scheme of things. It's just that the book is a bit unfunny, simplistic and a bit boring in some parts. He also tries to represent liberal minded people who aren't much like him. When he stops preaching and starts treating the reader like an equal, I'll be there. Borrow it from the library."
5,"Hey Michael, run for president...you have my vote!!!","This book is a must for anyone who has been scratching their head or thinking they're insane since November 2000. Michael has a great sense of humour and an astute political mind. A bit disturbing to read about the Dubya in-crowd...a foreshadowing of things that have only recently come to light. Run for office, Mike...or rather...don't...just keep on writing and muckracking!"
1,Stupid book written by a stupid person,"I read this book because my English Professor spoke highly of it. I would call it a collection of stupid and hypocritical opinions and ideas. So why did your bridge fall down Mr. Engineer? Oh, I dropped my structural steel class so I could do a course in another language. I don't think it's right to criticize something like a college degree if a person doesn't even possess one. Actually I think that something like a college degree would be a great start before writing a book like this. It might decrease the chances of writing a book as stupid as this one. This book insulted my intelligence and I wouldn't even recommend it for a laugh."
2,Poorly written and illogical,"I picked up this book to get a better understanding regarding the state of the nation and realized this book was an absolute joke! The book is written with poor grammer by someone who appears to have less than a high school education. In fact, the author admits in the book that he dropped out of high school. The book is rather entetaining but contains very subjective and illogical arguments. Read another book by someone with a little more intelligence!"
1,Wonderful!!,"Wonderfully full of ignorance at its finest. Typical views from an anti-American who takes things at face value, and refuses to look further into matters, before drawing a conclusion. I wouldn't expect anything more from someone as small minded and uneducated on politics then Michael Moore. But if you choose, join him in hating America and our troop's purpose at home and abroad, since they defend, with their life, your right to hate them. Also, take time to tell a fallen soldier's mother and father, brother or sister, wife or husband, or son or daughter that their family member did not have a cause and died in vain. I'm sure it will make you feel better. OR go to the library, educate yourself, and find out what a fool this guy really is."
1,Long on humor; manipulative and short on content,"Michael Moore is funny and very clever at manipulating opinion. But I find that even when I agree with his opinion, I wince at the poor reasoning, misleading statements and half-truths. He is very quick to insult people; he loves to take cheap shots."
1,count him in,"I couldn't believe that I had to read this for my government class, this book it utter trash. He only has 20 pages of sources, and nearly all of them being The New York Times, The Washington Post, Salon.com, and BBC News. Some of the the most disrespectful media forces out there. Compare this with Ann Coulters ""Treason"" and Dick Morris' ""Off with their heads,"" which have 46 and 52 pages of diverse souces, respectively. Pure trash from a stupid, fat, white man."
1,Fiction not facts,"To quote Roger Moore ""I always assume that only 10 to 20 percent of people who read my books or see my films will take the facts and hard-core analysis and do something with it."" I hope if you choose to read this book you will be one of the ones who checks the facts and not one of the people he dupes. There is alot of fiction and distortion and spin in this book as there is in most everything Moore does. He does not find the fiction in his works a problem though. To quote him again ""How can there be inaccuracy in comedy?"""
1,What a joke,"Michael Moore wouldn't know a fact if it bit him in the...! He's just ANOTHER angry, bitter liberal who can't stand the fact that a good man is in the White House. I'd be willing to bet that he'd still love Clinton if he saw Billy Jeff club a bunch of baby seals, hit on another intern, and shoot a random pedestrian... just as long as he didn't smoke.You leftists have spent too long blurring the lines between RIGHT AND WRONG, and forgotten which is which. Enjoy your Kool-Aid!"
4,Insightful. What are the Alternatives?,"Insightful and pragmatic...It is very important to question the role of corporations, influence of business, and the old school out-of-touch Protestants from well-to-do preppy families that were educated in private schools. This book can lead, even an American to think critically for a change. But would the average American buy and read this book? This book is worth the read.But as for the title....would blacks or hispanics run things better?....ask yourself that question."
1,Stupid White Men...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State...,"Not Moore's best effort. He was more factual and funny in his earlier works on film & television. I have no interest in the liberal/conservate conflict, so I find the bias in this book anti-intellectual. Playing loose with the facts will only please the ignorant. If you are that, you will love this book. I'm sorry to say this, but the only truly stupid white man in this book is the author. I hope he will do better work in the future. By the way, I am not white, and it should not matter anyway. I am a student of history, and this is no history book."
2,Why waste your money and time on this oaf...,"when you can read Noam Chomsky or Gore Vidal? Purchasing this clumsy, childish little rant instead of elegant critiques of American Politics such as ""Manufacturing Consent"" or ""Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace"" is like paying to drink out of a toilet instead of buying a bottle of Dom Perignon."
1,written by a stupid white man,"Being neither a democrat nor republican, I read this book with an open mind. I was curious to find out what all the hype was about. I found the book incredibly boring and I felt that Moore manipulated a lot of the statistics. For example, I could say that more people drink Guinness in the States than in Ireland. Well, that would be true, but the statistic is irrelevant because if you looked at the information per capita, it wouldn't be true. (...)"
2,Milking That GM Cow,"Nowhere near the power or acute targeted anger of ""Downsize This!."" His films ""Roger & Me"" started it all, and everything from ""Canadian Bacon"" to ""The Big One"" to ""Pets or Meat"" on film followed soon after, with the book ""Downsize This!"" taking it to the literary stream. ""Stupid White Men"" has a few enlightening moments but for the most part falls so far short of ""Downsize This!"" that it must be embarrasing for the big guy. Stick with ""Roger & Me"" as his film masterpiece and ""Downsize This!"" as his best book. Skip ""Stupid White Men"" unless you can savor the few slanted but humorous bits that are entertaining in this book."
5,Only informed open minds need apply,"If you have the ability for critical thinking and a reasoned argument then this book will not only enlighten you, it may frighten you enough to take action and make a difference, which is what Mike Moore is trying to do. The facts are verifiable and if you question them...PLEASE personally investigate them! Don't repeat ignorant comments from unverifiable sources. (Dear Kyoto comment person, Do you honestly know what the treaty states? and that most countries DID sign it). If you are a lobbyist or an indicted corporate exec. you already know that most people will not believe the truth or even care enough to know about your business. Take the time to read this book, it's easy, funny, requires little effort, but offers information that the powerful have been very successful in repressing. Hey Americans open your minds for something."
2,Another idiot's 15 minutes worth of fame,"Michael Moore is also a `stupid white man'. To suggest that everyone in Ireland converts to Catholicism is the most ridiculous thing ever to be published. I am not a Bush fan, and that is as nicely as I can put it.... Oh all right, I hate him. But Michael Moore is really no better. Could you imagine this guy as president? He reminds me a little of that buffoon Rush Limbaugh. He claims to have all the answers, claims to know how to do everything, but when it comes down to it, he can't do a thing but talk. Well this is America and we all have the right to free speech, but couldn't we all do a book like this? Why does Michael Moore get to have his insane opinions published for his own financial gain? Why don't we all do it? We're all literate, we all have opinions. I'm going to begin my book right now. I'll title it ""Michael Moore and Other Loud Mouthed Yankees who Need to Shut Up."""
1,"If you're still angry about Gore, you'll love this.","Let's face it, Moore is an angry Socialist and his ""shtick"" is getting tiresome. I'll admit that it was funny watching him chase Roger around the Generally Mediocre (GM) headquarters, but this latest installment of angry uberliberal is just 200+ pages of leftwing conspiracy theories, outright lies and some interesting ""interpretations"" of events. All of this would be OK if it were funny, but in the end it comes off as the bitter ramblings of a guy pining for the good old days when Bubba ran the show and who now is still bitter because Bubba's sidekick the human tree himself Al Gore didn't win the election."
5,"Go Michael, It's Your Birthday!","Michael Moore speaks for a segment of the population that doesn't get heard that often. Rather than offer up dissent for the sake of dissent, he backs up his arguments with facts while making you laugh about it at the same time. It's amazing that this book was written before 9.11 and Enron. Michael is obviously a very sharp individual as he touched on these topics frequently. Definitely an must read for anyone who wants real change in the US of A!"
4,Very irritating. Liked it.,"There is a fair amount I find rather annoying about this book, that I find annoying about Moore generally. But I think that's actually his strong point. He's a pain in the behind. His style reminds me very much of that other great American loudmouth Frank Zappa, from whose Real Frank Zappa Book he may have stolen some of his crazed, gonzo energy. The rant style is a bit wearisome at times - not all of us are converted by a one sided argument.However I can't help feeling that the Right will always be stronger in America for as long as they have a writer as funny as PJ O'Rourke. Moore's not there yet..."
1,not what it's hyped up to be,"The first two and the last chapters are well researched, written and even managed to build in me some internal rage towards the political machine.But the rest of the chapters weren't worth publishing. Some of the issues in the middle chapters, Moore has no more insight into than the average american who watches the evening news. The sections on mad cow disease, the environment, ""kill whitey"" and ""the end of men"" were just plain boring. Nothing new - just read the papers or watch the news. And what the hell were all those grey boxed comments for? They didn't even manage to get a chuckle out of me. Just filling up pages, I think.The only thing Moore seems to have done his homework on was the 2000 elections. So, the bit on the florida scandal was an interesting read.This book is definitely not what it is hyped up to be. He seems like a good guy though."
1,Insult to anyone who reads.,"I recieved this book as a gift. I would not pruchase it. It was slow, scattered and with little substance. The author spent too much time on rumor and should have checked his facts as I found it to be mostly a rant for shock value to attract buyers. A sad way to sell ideas or books."
1,The most stupid white man...,"...is the one who wrote this book. In an interview with Lou Dobbs of CNN, Mr. Dobbs asked Mr. Moore about the inaccuracies of fact in his book. Moore shrugged off the quesiton, saying ""You know, look, this is a book of political humor. So, I mean, I don't respond to that sort of stuff, you know."" ""Glaring inaccuracies?"" Mr. Dobbs said. ""No, I don't. Why should I? How can there be inaccuracy in comedy?""Note that, ""how can there be inaccuracy in comedy?"" If there can be no inaccuracy in comedy then there can be no accuracy and this book is nothing more than the mindless, wishful drivel of a bitter and frustrated man (who never-the-less makes a ton of money off the system he deplores - proving, I guess, that there *are* a lot of stupid white men out there who are buying his book).Do yourself a favor, ignore this piece of trash."
1,Guilt Trip Psychobabble,"Yes, the author may very well be the stupidest white man in America. I'm #2 for wasting my money on this garbage."
1,"so bad, it's incredible","it had appeared that moore's propaganda film ""bowling for columbine"" was going to be the undoubted champion of the world's poorest achievement in the arts of the last 100,000 years...but this book must be a co-champ. both are so factually inaccurate that it is a testament to the greatest country in the world that we would publish such trash. i would recommend for people to buy this book so that if you run out of toilet paper and don't want to run to the store, you will have a readily available source of wiping paper."
1,Completely Ficticious and Ridiculous,There is absolutely no entertainment value in this book at all.Just a bunch of complaining about something that hasn't gone his way. He is completely wrong about everything. The book is just full of hate. It is neither funny nor true.
5,Way Left But Funny,"Stupid White Men is an offbeat look at white men and the stupid thingsthey do. The book is funny in a sort of race-baiting, leftist way.Moore devotes considerable space to putting down our currentpresident, hauling out the good-old canard of how Bush stole the lastpresidential election from Al Gore with the help of his (white)brother Jeb. The allegation is, of course, not supported by facts,but heck, its funny. (...) Judging by thisbook, it's fairly obvious Moore isn't exactly averse to singling out aparticular race for ridicule. Not that there's anything wrong withbigotry these days...as long as it's directed toward the appropriategroup, which, just now happens to be white people and...oh yeah,Catholics. Lets face it, sometimes Whitey needs to be put in hisplace, and this superbly-crafted volume does just that. Highlyrecommended."
1,Stupid White Men,"I am in the minority of people who think this book is perhaps one of the worst I've ever read. I am just glad that I didn't buy it, but borrowed someone else's copy. I honestly do not know how so many people would like this book. I do not appreciate this man's comments about the South. It just shows that he is very ignorant on the South. I hate narrow-minded people and this author is one of the most narrow-minded writers I've ever encountered."
2,Racist and Narrow-Minded,"This work is obviously not intended to be serious. It's meant to be a comedic harangue at George W. Bush and the Republican Party.I admit, it got a few chuckles out of me - but not many. It mostly just borders on outright inane and lame.There's nothing really new in here, he just calls Bush a stupid drug addict throughout the whole book. This also crosses the line into racism. Moore makes a ton of sweeping, negative generalizations about white people which are quite offensive.If you are liberal, you may like this. If you are moderate or conservative, you'll probably just be annoyed by it. Whether or not you enjoy this will depend entirely on your political ideology."
2,Michael Moore One dimensional thinker,"Why people think Michael Moore is some kind of deep thinker with his pulse on the issues is beyond me. He's a liberal with a chip on his shoulder the size of Texas! Maybe he never understood the concept of the electoral collage, but in this case it worked exactly the way it was meant to. Yes we all know Al Gore got more votes, but if you look at states won it was Bush easily! I for one am thankful for George Bush being in office for 9/11 and after! Moore doesn't think about the issue's he feels them and going on your feelings without thinking is always a mistake! The Democrats need to get over the 2000 election and move on, but every time they think there in a room full of liberals they start crying about the election!Mr. Moore makes some good points in this book, but he fails to effectively look at both sides of this issue, it's his way or no way! Buy this book but keep in mind you need to get the other point of view."
2,It's just satire and not political insight,"I like Michael Moore. But remember that while Roger and Me was funny, it was also 10 years too late.Same stuff in Stupid White Men. All sorts of cutting satire and quite a few good lines. However, most of this book is so passe. As with all things, timing is everything. This book would have been a lot funnier one year ago. But since the mass murder of Sept 11, Stupid White Men reads like some adolescent whining by a kid who refuses to grow up. As a result, much of Michael Moore's sharpest barbs come off as petty and shallow. Most thinking people I know have shared this opinion.I'm always amused by multi-millionares trying to pass themselves off as blue collar heroes. He markets himself well. In the end though, Michael Moore is just a guy hustling a buck for Michael Moore. Like Roger and Me, Stupid White Men has passed its expiration date for freshness."
4,Scary and True,"Stupid White Men...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the NationBy the end of the first chapter one would think that they had found the converse to Rush Limbaugh based on all the ""Bush Bashing"". By the end of the book one realizes, unlike Limbaugh, Moore is not one sided on all issues as he is equally critical of Clinton, Gore and the entire Democratic Party.The subject matter is kept light by Moore's use of humor. One sometimes wonders whether what they are reading is written for the sake of humor or is factual. Once I came to the ""Notes and Sources"" section in the back of the book I realized that the book is based on extensive research.Some sections may not retain your interest as much as other sections, but the book is well worth the read to the end. His views on the justice system, political parties, health care, environment, education, nuclear weapons, legislators and segregation are concerning, scary and true."
1,You call this reality?,"Being a moderate Republican (yes they do exist), I was challenged by a liberal Democrat friend to read this book. I could barely get through it without wanting to throw it in the trash. This is nothing more than a collection of over-the-top tripe. Michael Moore should be ashamed. What ever happened to presenting factual information?This is a perfect example of the type of misinformation perpetuated by the far liberal left where fiction and fact conveniently exchange places to substantiate one&#65533;s argument. This book does a gross injustice to those liberal issues with merit. With this guy toting the liberal banner, it gives those with a real and substantiated message a bad name.If you are looking for a good laugh or something to get your blood boiling give this book a quick look. However, see if you can find it in someone else&#65533;s garbage, as it is not worth a plug nickel."
1,"bad research, lazy writer","Moore has some good points on health insurance, but he has so many fallacies and even more statistical errors...It is sad that he has won so many awards for this fiction book which purports to be non-fiction. ... Also, he wrongly quotes and misleads the viewer concerning a campaign video from the 80's. ...You would think an award-winning book and a video that won many European awards and an oscar that claims to be a documentary would at least be somewhat accurate, or as in the video's case, has a point. Sadly, thousands that read or view these lazy-written or done mediums will not know of their inaccuracy...."
1,Adolescent ranting,"This book is a very [bad] attempt to rationalize viewpoints composed entirely of sniveling, whining, tantrums. Nothing in it ever comes close to approaching reality.I would expect a book of this intellectual caliber from a eight year old... not an accountable adult.Very disappointing."
4,"""Stupid White Men"" an excellent book that reveals the truth","Michael Moore's book ""Stupid White Men"" is a book that hammered the truth about the people running our country. He uses facts and statistics to prove his point of view that the white men running our country are using their position to benefit themselves instead of working on improving our country which is on a downfall since Bush entered his office."
2,What a cry baby,After seeing an interview with Michael Moore I decided to check his book out. I couldn't even finish the book. All he seems to do is vent about his hatred to George W. Bush. I kept thinking maybe he'll move on to something else when I turn the page. Nope. There are few pages that don't completely criticize Bush. There were some funny ideas and some good points made (that's why I gave it 2 stars). But don't buy this book. Check it out from a library or borrow it from someone unfortunate enough to have bought it.
2,What it Promises to be,"Michael Moore never promised to give anything but a one-sided account of things, and he did. As an Independent and I can see the expertly crafted arguments with hand-picked facts to support it. All his facts are true I suppose but that doesn't mean he's showing all the evidence. He also takes many things out of context. For instance, you can say that President Roosevelt declared war on the Japanese and from that make the argument that he was a war-monger. But you would be leaving out the fact that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. (And no I am not comparing WWII to the War on Terror)Michael Moore never states he's giving the full account of the way things are. Thats good because he doesn't."
1,Whine whine whine,"So Michael Moore has a grudge match with Shrub (Dubya) and his family. So Michael Moore is a cult success against Big Business as the Underdog of The People. So he can write. So what? The man reads like a white frat boy who just got fired from his first real job because <gasp!> he was incompetent and nobody wanted to carry his deadweight anymore. This isn't a coherent review because frankly I found his incessant whining and complaining to ring in my ears like a nasally tenor stereotype. Yuck. I was hoping for substance; I didn't find it here. Back to Molly Ivins, then.Move along, would-be reader. Nothing to see here, nothing to see..."
1,Save your money,"Fortunately for Mikey, racism against white people is politically correct. He is inflammatory without being humorous or thought provoking. If you are politically conservative or moderate, forget this book. If you are more liberal, you can do much better elsewhere. ..."
1,Frightening,"I consider myself a moderate. I think both parties are equally to blame for the apathy that exists in this country. Michael Moore, unfortunately, misses the mark with this book. Instead of offering an insight as promised, he skews the truth and downright lies in order to foster the idea that he is an intellectual.He does not want to own up to the errors he's made. He is just a narcissistic liberal who feels he is smarter than everyone else and that people will listen to him because he is so brilliant.I read this book right before he made is inane, idiotic comments at the Oscars. And, some people defend him, saying his comments were so American. Well, I am exercising my right to say he is ignorant.Buy this book if you want to laugh at how self-absorbed someone can be. Avoid it at all costs if such selfishness turns you off."
1,Socialist Garbage,"For anyone who is a socialist, a communist, or hates America, then this book is for you. For all the normal people, though, this book is a complete waste of money. Most of the ""facts"" in this book are nothing but rumor or half-truths that when researched correctly, prove to be mostly wrong or a complete lie. It is sad when an author has to sell books by using the ""Jerry Springer model"" of complete outrageousness and total falsehood just to make money. Even liberals should be ashamed that this man is within their ranks beacuse after reading this book, I wanted to join the libertarian party. Some advice Mike, next time you write a book on ""stupid white men"", maybe you should go to a library and read on what us ""stupid white men"" have done for this country to make it as great as it is today, and if you hate this country so much, which from your book you apparently do, then just leave and go somewhere where people will appreciate your socialist diatribes."
1,You have to be kidding me...,"I only had to glance through a few pages to determine that this guy is one big fat mouth. While I support Michael Moore's right to bashing (by the 2nd Amendment), I have the right to disagree. The biggest turnoff was the ""Kill Whitey"" chapter. He advocates never hiring whites for jobs among other things and blames every evil the world on them. Maybe the next time he wants to rant erronousely on white people he should take a look in the mirror.I had to put the book down after ten minutes. I hope he doesn't think we are to take this book seriously."
2,The facts are simply too distorted,"I would only give this book one star if it weren't for some of the comic relief that it offers. Unlike the nuts on the far right like Coulter and Savage who simply try to create irrational anger with their distortion of fact, Moore at least attempts to poke fun from his (far left) point of view. The problem in political discourse today is the lack reason for emotion. To update Mark Twain, today there are lies, damned lies, and spin. The spin is where things get dangerous, because people don't stick to the facts, they just distort and misrepresent them. ..."
1,Lies,"This book is just 100% of fabricated, staged facts used to provoke peoples diluted brains into believing the fool that is Moore. Stupid demonctratic piece of junk. What is America coming to?"
1,Crap.,Michael Moore rants and raves against all things right of center without adding anything cinstructive. No answers just complaining and virtues of being on the far left. He disparages anyone well off except the those ultra left elitist.Plain garbage. Its unfortunate that after a pretty good TV series that made yuo think he writes this junk wich thnks for you.
3,Michael Moore steps over the line,"Stupid White Men by Michael Moore is nothing more then extreme liberal babble with a ""witty"" outlook on racism, foreign, and domestic issues. The book is broken up into chapters on the Bush administration, the evil nature and intentions of the entire Caucasian race, voter fraud, and corporate ties to the government. He attempts to capture the state of our national government and on a micro level, the state of human beings in America attempting to expose truths and increase social consciousness to ultimately benefit the reader's outlook on our country."
2,who wants the whole truth anyway?,"The sardonic tone was quite comical for the first 50 pages but the rest of the 274 seemed too labored. Moore, in his attempt to unveil the evils of our government, forgets to remind us that there is good there as well. I do feel like Moore makes many valid points when discussing the fact the Republicans and Democrats came from the same cookie cutter but the liberal bias of the book leaves me a bit distrustful as to the validity of his opinion as a whole. Yes both Clinton and Bush have not been environmentally friendly, but they reflect American Society as a whole. We talk the talk but no one wants to make the extra step to buy a Camry over the Hummer. It is often too easy to blame our leaders for our problems when in fact they only reflect the public. That is what a republic is: choosing representatives that represent you! All in all, Stupid White Men was more biased than I would have liked but Moore is not really one for impartiality."
1,I hate this book,"Why did I buy this book?1. I was stupid....I am a Malaysian, not white, not eligible to vote for any US president. Don't know what Republicans or Democrates have done to Americans.2. To give Moore the money to buy another bottle of Evian"
1,A brilliant slanderous libel,"Brilliantly written, but a masterpiece of partisanism. If G.W. Bush one day will take this guy to Court he will have to leave behind even his underwears. The allegations he made are absolute rubbish from beginning to the end.If George W. was the ""thief in chief"" then Al Gore would have to be the stupid in chief. If you go to a department store and they cheat on your bill what will you do? having the right on your side you will fight to the end to have your money back, but what about Al Gore? He has been cheated, according to the author, of the the top job in the World and he just kept quiet about that. So, if this is real, he would have never been worth of the top job itself!"
1,Why can't I pick no stars?,"Michael Moore-put simply he is just the democrat's attempt to show off their ""regular guy"" supporters. This college drop out and oscar winner(that shows you how hollywood is off on some other planet) likes to ramble and distort facts which he dose a lot. He is a perfect examle of how off-base the liberal media is from the real world. If you happen to accidently read this like I did I recommened Ann Coulter's book Slander. That will set you stright again."
1,didn't make me laugh OR think,"intelligent liberals across america will dismay at the success of 'stupid white men.' rather than providing an ideologically sound look at the state of american politics, moore just dishes up more cheap cannon fodder for the conservatives. if this is where the left is headed, I might have to stop calling myself a liberal. if you're expecting the makes-you-laugh/makes-you-think wit of 'bowling for columbine', wait for the paperback. better yet, go to an iraq protest. this rag isn't worth the time it takes to read it."
3,It's a good starting point!,"Stupid White Men is an apparent collection of essays that have arisen from the painful reality of our nation. In its usual thought-provoking, social commentary style, Michael Moore embarks himself in a quest to unearth some of the buried, appalling facts about the corporate U.S government during recent years, including a more or less detailed description of the suspicious happenings during one of the most controversial points in American history, the two thousand presidential elections. Unfortunately, ad hoc to persuade the populace into his doozie ideas his arguments become one-sided, subjective and unverifiable. His writing also leaves much to desire. Nevertheless, he makes us think; and for that he succeeds."
4,m+m=the great white hope!,"This book is one of the funniest I've ever read; mm is a gawd-send. Doesn't ""President 'Moore'"" sound better than ""President 'Bush'""?? What I'm sayin' is: Michael Moore for President!"
1,The Title Says It All,"What a swell title! In only three words he communicates his racism, sexism, and absolutism."
5,FANTASTIC,This book is amazing...a very fast read. I thought it was going to be a bunch of liberal garbage being shoved down my throat...instead is was thought-provoking and enlightening. It will make you want to get out of your chair and change things...I know I now want to run for President as soon as I hit the age requirement. But it now!
4,Puts The Con in Conservative,"There is nothing like a dose of humour to diffuse any situation. Except Stupid White Men, far from diffusing, hangs like an albatross of shame around the neck of the American elite.Very much a read-them-and-weep chronology of US-style deceit, conflict-of-interest and lies, the irreverent Stupid White Men addresses politicians, schools, minorities, Palestinians, Zionists and even -bonus!- includes a pop quiz for your politicians.Michael Moore has written a well-researched almanac of the dangers threatening America. Indeed, those who dislike this book, or worse have not read it, are the perfect individuals of which enemies of America would love to see more.Stupid White Men is a great antidote to the flood of mud spewing from the belly of the beast."
3,From a foreigner's point of view,"I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Moore's well-known ' Bowlingfor Columbine', and immediately started looking for a bookwritten by Moore. 'Stupid White Men' was surely interestingat the beginning, but for me, started to loose its charm atthe end- the main reason for this was not that I got sick ofMoore's sarcasm ( which I delight in ) , but that I did nothave a fundamental knowledge of U.S. politics. Anyway, thereis much too learn from Moore's book and more to enjoy if youhave sufficient political interest/knowledge."
3,eh......its ok,"You gotta be a critical reader with this one. Moore's self hatred of his whiteness tends to lead some pretty ridiculous comments. Also he doesnt seem to have a real good grasp on the electoral system. All in all, he brings up some good points and does it with a great sense of humor and irony, but take it with a grain of salt."
1,Sorry excuse for a literary work.,"I began in earnest to be open minded about this book. It quickly turned into a narrow minded, incoherent excuse for the ills of the world. I am only compelled to write this to attempt to keep someone from wasting their time. I would strongly suggest any writing from Dinest D'souza for a balanced view of this country."
1,I didn't read this book,"I didn't read this book, But it's content is so predicatable that I am confident I can write a fairly accurate opinion of it. It is a littany of venmous, hatred of conservatives and apparently ""White Men"". If Michale Moore's vision on the world was actually come to pass, does he honestly believe he'd have the opportunity to live such a posh existence? The people he hates, conservative-business men (white men, especially), have created the industries he so loths, but is so dependant upon. I've heard the man talk, his thinking is devoid of a logical rationale. In politics, (and in most arenas nowadays), the job of destroying people's reputation is becoming less difficult if that is the sole objective. Lord knows what could be undercovered about Mr. Michael Moore, and I eagerly anticipate it been revealed."
1,File this one in the good ole' circular..,"Sure, I'm a conservative, but any well-educated citizen can appreciate bantering from the other side. ""Bantering"", though, Moore's book was not.. ""juvenile"", ""factually inaccurate"", and ""downright annoying"" would be more on-target."
1,Stupid White Men-Smart White Woman,"Michel Moore's ""Stupid White Men"" ostensibly appears to be liberal political commentary promulgating itself through humor. After reading about 25% of the book, however, I had to put it back on the bookshelf because it was obvious that ""Stupid White Men"" is really meant to entertain, not to inform the reader or raise issues for public debate. However, you *should* buy the book. By reading ""Stupid White Men"", you will be able to relate to what Ann Coulter-a 'Smart White Woman'-is talking about in her book, ""Slander."""
1,The State of the Nation...for the uneducated,Michael Moore panders to young socialists who know nothing better than to listen only to those who use humor to convey their extremist ideas. Anyone up with the issues will know that Michael Moore is notorious for being a demagogue. I have read the book and I am disgusted by it.This is the same man who denounces corporations but uses private jets to travel across the country. He reveals conservative talk-show hosts' phone numbers and accuses them of murder.He is a racist. The funny thing is that he is racist against himself.F.
4,"Oh, how the right gets so wound up by stuff like this.","In light of what has recently passed for journalism from FOX (O'Really?, Hannity, etc.), and everyone's favourite bow-tied right wing pretty boy with a last name for a first name, Tucker Carlson, not to mention Frau Coulter, knowing there are people like Moore and Frankin out there gives us some hope after all.Yes, Moore has his weaknesses, and if he does distort facts, how different is it from the blowhards listed above who spew hate, misinformation, and display the typical traits of Dr. Johnson's patriotic scoundrels? Well, a little different, actually. Minus the hate, certainly. The accusations that Moore is anti-American are just simply lazy, knee-jerk reactions from people incapable of seeing the world any other way than in black and white.Despite his weaknesses, Moore can see the world in a more complex manner than his detractors. A worthwhile read."
4,More Moore,"Even if you don't agree with his politics, he does raise some interesting facts of both the Bush administration, and Clinton's. And all of it is done with his wicked sense of humor that cuts right to the bone. Anyone who saw and liked ""Bowling for Columbine"" or watched his acceptance speech on the Academy Awards will already be familiar with his irreverent attitude. The book is chock full of facts and figures of the calamities our leaders have been commiting without many of us knowing anything about it. Several chapters had me laughing out loud including, 'The End of Men' and 'The People's Prayer', which is a heavenly plea to smite our leaders with poverty, gay sons and daughters,handicapped children and rotting teeth without dental coverage."
5,About time!,"Mike-Thank you so much for writing that book. Here I was thinking we were the only ones who didn't see the man (ahem, men, heh heh) behind the curtain, that maybe that my husband and I and a handful of bewildered friends were the only sane Americans left watching in horror as the entire nation seemed to be gleefully dancing on the edge of a great precipice...okay, enough awful prose, but seriously, it is so damned relieving to see an unapologetically Liberal (when did the political preference of the majority become a dirty word?) rant hit the bestseller list- and I'm really hoping it will encourage some folks to get off their lazy butts and do something about these clowns. ... Thanks and good luck, and when do we get to see you on TV again?"
1,Stupid Men,What an appropriate title- he is the ultimate Stupid White man. He is a sorry excuse for a human being. It seems more and more books are being written just to make money for idiots like him. At least most thinking people will not bother to read it. Just the fanatics.
1,Worst book ever,"This book is full of venemous hatred and factual errors. In his blind rage over the constitution following Supreme Court, Moore reveals his utter ineptitude at forming rational thoughts. He proves that the liberal agenda is based on the statement if you can't beat them, verbally abuse and slander them. The only redeeming thing about this book is that he stands on the cover with the words stupid white men."
4,Stupid White Men,"It took an angry man to write such a book! How it is drop dead funny to know the life of America nowaday, and before. For non-American and non-white person like me, this book is completely, definitely, extremely entertaining. Some parts are too oversimplify but still blood-boiling to read."
2,Over rated,"There were only a few notable areas which were very informative, overall the text is palaver--filled with ramblings about himself and other meaningless additions that take away from his credibility. It's easy to be a critic, it's harder to maintain a credible image as a critic people look to for insight."
1,"Silly, trite, angry book","This is a silly book ...If one wants an inflammatory book with corny humor than this might be for you. It reminds me of Al-Jezeer news coverage of the Iraq war. Trueth doesn't matter. The objective is to say things in an attempt to justify hatred, occupy enough of the reader's time so they won't be able to read or listen to more comprehensive coverage of the facts, and to incite enough suspicion to deter people from accepting reality."
5,"Hillarious, and sadly/poignantly accurate","Bitterly sarcastic, stinging, and absolutely true. Read it and weep. It strikes me almost as funny...There's not really much in it that's new per se; it's just all in one place, and, finally, being read by ""the mainstream"". Bravo to Michael Moore for speaking the truth, and raspberrys to the many, many people who tried to kill it before it even got published. The truth may be ugly sometimes, but it's necessary to a free people."
2,Never has a book title so aptly reflected the author...,"Misleading ""facts"", emotionally-based opinions and very little else - which is really a shame.I'm a European ex-pat, living in the US, and I was present during the election debacle. Yes, we KNOW it wasn't exactly ""above board""...and yes, we know that the family ties linking the President to various self confessed extreme right wingers are stronger than steel...but Moore could have (and should have) chosen a much different formula in getting his message across, and some of the blatantly misleading facts he offers are something I'd expect from a 10th grader - not a respected journalist.Sadly, the book reads like yet another ""Stupid White Man's"" pity party, and fails to give a solid or even factually accurate representation of the US.I gave this book two stars - because in some places the material has great comedic value. But if you're looking for an accurate critique of the nation, save your money."
4,"Good, but also can scare the pants off you.","I purchased this book as an attempt to balance the effects of also purchasing 'Slander', and frankly, I am taken aback by the thorough illustration of what our country is headed for. While I consider myself a member of neither party, I tend to be more Republican than Democrat when it comes to the majority of issues. Be that as it may, after finishing this book, I am nothing short of dismayed at the state of our nation, yet it's our greatness as a nation that allows ideas like this to be expressed. Well written, researched, and incisive, it will also scare the bejesus out of you if you think seriously about the road this work has us traveling down. (and we ARE on said road, no question. It doesn't take a PHD)I would recommend it, but be prepared. It doesn't paint a pretty picture in the least, nor does it give you confidence that things are getting better."
2,It's a Conspiracy!,"I think Michael Moore has finally reached his limit of relevance, this book wasn't funny as much as a ceaseless rambling of all the bad things he sees around us, and some truly whacko ideas on what's behind it all. (Hey, I can come up with facts, too. It's how they're interpreted...)The book doesn't make much sense and gets worse as it goes on. ...But more to the point, if the world is trashed by stupid white men who use their power and connections to impress their views on us and take our money, and Moore is a white millionaire who uses his power and connections to impress his views in his books and films people buy....what makes him so much different?This isn't some intellectual monologue, if it was he had more ideas on how the country could be improved or what to do about all the Stupid People. Instead it's a rant by a man with an ego running out of ideas. ...Moore will make some money off this as usual, hopefully next time he'll have something better to do than complain."
1,I Love This Book: Which Means I Have An Inferiority Complexx,"I am a black person, a minority. After reading Moore's opinions, he clearly doesn't believe that I am intelligent or capable enough on my own to rise through the social ladder. Moore instead wants to give me handouts and enforce the racist stereotype against blacks that they need to be given everthing automatically."
4,Throwing More Spit Wads at the Administration,"A lot of interesting ideas, and the best idea that emanates from the book...QUESTION YOUR LEADERS!!He still reminds me too much of the kid in the back of the room firing spit balls. A little too much immaturity showing up in several chapters, but he has GUTS, and more Americans should follow is example of courage to say what he wants to say. I will defend his right to say what he wants to say. (...)"
3,Umm....,"I guess there is something to learn somewhere in the book. I am having trouble finding it between the [complaining] fits. There is plenty of information but no sources to back the findings. Some items are exaggerated making this a great humor source for non Americans. It kind of exposes potential weaknesses in America to the world. After the terrorism attacks, this is not the time for it. I guess I kind of got blocked by the title with Stupid White Men because people like Elaine Chao and Condoleezza Rice are not men and Colin Powell is neither stupid nor white. Maybe Bitchy White Man could have been a better title."
5,Everyone should read this,This is one of the most thought provoking books I've read in a long time. I was nearly floored by some of the information he revealed and after reading this book I almost want to go out and become a champion for the improvement of our nation.
3,look past his ranting at the beginning and end...,"the first 2 chapters of Bush bashing got r-r-r-really redundant, (and as we all know now, shortsighted), but the remaining chapters were pretty entertaining. i even laughed out loud a few times.finding ""big holes"" in several of his arguments, i realized i was more conservative than i thought. (or maybe he's farther to the left than he thinks he is?) his comments about education were ""right on the mark"" though, and he didn't mind trashing clinton and gore.if you catagorize yourself as liberal, you'll enjoy his writing. if you're a conservative republican, you'll think he's a raving lunatic. if you consider yourself an independant moderate, you may find yourself drawn left or right by your reactions to this book (as i did). one cannot read the book without reacting to it, so i recommend it just for that reason. it really should rate 3.5 stars, but amazon didn't see fit to give us that option...."
5,Superb,"Funny. Fair. Insightful. Michael Moore may be outraged, but with good reason. Intelligent readers will find much of value in here, even if they don't agree with the politics. The rabidly right wing faction will foam at the mouth, but that's nothing new. They foam at the mouth when Michael Moore wakes up in the morning, and continues to draw breath.And thank God he does. And I hope he continues to do so for many, many more years. Keep writing, Michael.Oh, and though I may be mistaken, I believe that the rank of #1, which Stupid White Men currently holds, has to do with sales figures, and is in no way affected by customer reviews. All that does is affect the number of stars displayed under Avg. Customer Reviews. Stupid White Men is Amazon's #1 because America WANTS to buy this book."
5,Michael Moore in Top Form,"Michael Moore is at the top of his game. Even though this book was written almost a year ago, his arguments are as sharp and incisive as ever. This book, even if you don't agree with Moore's strong political opininons, will have you laughing out loud. Perhaps the most important thing about this book is not what he says about the stupid white men (and there are plenty of them!), but how he uses their stories to bring up a viable discussion of how these things are influencing our lives. If you have never watched one of his award winning movies or TV shows, you might not get the joke at first. But, if you have an open mind you will be delighted by the time the introduction is over."
1,SHOCKED,"My kindergartner brought this book home from his school library. We just finished reading it, and I was sicked by this story. It is not only written horribly, but it teaches horrible values....Robbery, lying, name-calling, etc. I will be talking to the school librarian and principal concerning this book tomorrow and hopefully it will be pulled (or at least banned from the younger kids). Do NOT NOT NOT spend money on this ""book""."
5,Four Feet in History,"In the days before motorized vehicles and tractors, city businesses and rural farms were powered by horses. Draft Horses, Light Horses and everything in between were harnessed to the plow, express wagons (think UPS with horses) and even houses. Charles (""Chappie"") Fox sheds a spotlight on all aspects of the horses of yesteryear; from the building of the vehicles, the equipment and stables, to the hitches used for advertising to the circus, farm and fire horses. Take a nostalgic look back or discover a little bit of history with this Beautiful! book- full of illustrations, paintings and photographs, along with well written and informative captions and commentary from a man who knows the business inside and out. My copy is well worn and well cherished! A fantastic gift for any horseperson, regardless of their chosen discipline."
4,Christmas present,I gave this book a 4 star only because I bought my son and his wife this for Christmas and my son raved about it and said it was a fantastic book. So I have not personally seen the book.They one day will have working horses.
4,Solid design and construction,There are only two flaws with this product one is the single screw that holds the solid steel shelf top to the frame. Second the manufacturer should include the optional strap instead I have had to order it from a non-Amazon online merchant. Otherwise I do highly recommend this for any wall mounted flat screen tv. In my case I used it for my Grandmother's Philco DTV converter box connected to her analog LCD tv. The reception is clear and perfect.
4,"Good entertainment, but the leaste effective Star Wars!","Almost a great movie, it wasn't Jar Jar, it was Liam Neeson that hurt this film. His portrayal of a moody almost stupid highly trained Jedi blows my mind! What was Lucas thinking? Yes Jedi have human bodies and are therefore subject to the earthly needs, thus they turn to the ""Dark Side"", but they are still powerful, but for personal gain, not universal peace and justice for all. Strange character he was! In all fairness he didn't write the part, but I got the feeling he didn't believe in the character."
3,"Good Movie, just not legendary","The first three Star Wars movies are legendary. They are timeless classics that have a cult following. That brings us to the fourth episode in the series Phantom Menace. This was a very well done movie with a great story of how Anakin Skywalker and OB Won Kanobi first meet. The special effects were wonderful, Even Jar Jar Binks. I may be in the minority but I felt Jar Jar actually added to the movie. Just as in all stories the beginning is the slowest, it is where characters need to be developed so the story is usually slow. It is an important part of the story but the movie just doesn't reach that legendary level of the previous three. On the DVD the extras are worth the purchase. There is a sit down interview with George Lucas which is very rare since he does not do a lot of interviews and he gives you a behind the scenes look at how they made the movie. I still recomend this for anyone who likes the Star Wars movies or is a sci-fi fan."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I know that I'll probably end up catching {stuff} from various people that Star Wars is not in the Top Ten of 1999, but tough! I don't think that it deserves to belong there. Yeah, the special effects were great and yes, we've all been waiting years for it, but that doesn't earn it the right to jump to the top. There are several weak story points (I won't spoil it in case you haven't yet seen the film) that take away from the movie. Plus George seems to have been more in love with the CGI characters than he was in the story.For a true story, I think that it is lacking. But I will definitely concede the point that Phantom Menace gets you hyped up for the others. I've had hours of conversations on what can and should happen next, plus what is the best way to pull it off. And I expect to have many more hours. So from an energy point of view, I will have put more energy in to Phantom Menace this year than any other film in a long while."
4,"Boy, did I like this movie!","I loved this movie! The effects, the story, and the characters. I stood in line for the Star Wars nine nights in a row, and remember that the reviewers (who tend to feel that movies about good and evil are not serious film) panned the show for much the same reasons. If Jive Dudes make you nervous, that's your problem. You are a creature of your times. That's OK, but certainly not a flaw in the movie..."
3,"Okay Movie, Bas Excuse for a Star Wars Film","This movie would have been a decent movie had it not been set in the Star Wars Universe, but it was and compared to the other films it had a rather weak story line and horrible characters. All the characters look really cool, such as the Battle Droids, but without an interesting story they're nothing but wasted.DVD extras ""You're my only hope"" for saving this film."
3,To be Star Wars or not to be Star Wars?,"Fans of the original trilogy (The only ""real"" Star Wars) might be a little disappointed with this movie. The plot was strong, but not as strong as the originals, the diversity of the charactors wasn't as multitudinous, and there weren't nearly as many surprises, as a fan of the first three movies, Episode 1 paled in comparison; the introduction of Jar Jar binks, I found, was both pointless and annoying, but might, and probably does, appeal to the newer fans of this epic saga, Many of my friends were repulsed by Jar Jar, but, I felt, he added some humor to this movie, but enough about Jar Jar and his debatable ""homicide"" of Star Wars for so many people. TPM's special-efects were fascinating, they were far better than Star Wars: A New Hope and possibly The Empire Strikes back (Don't hurt me, it's just my opinion) but it resembled The Return of the Jedi, as far as effects go. Definitely, if you've not seen this movie ... get it"
3,"3 1/2 Stars. Finally, On DVD...","...so you can fast-forward through to the good parts. I enjoyed watching this film in the theatres, but most people have the right idea about this film: That it was a big money-making operation. There is a lot to like about this film: The light sabre fight scenes were great, the Pod Racing scene was great, the scenes in Coruscant were amazing and there were three or four other parts that I loved. But the Jar-Jar stuff, in fact all the Gungan characters were silly and annoying. That one character, coupled with the depiction of droids WE would'nt use to fight wars, took alot away from the film."
4,STOP!!!,"Okay guys, it's time to STOP bashing TPM!!! Needless to say (check the name), I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I watch, read, write and collect it. Out of all SW movies, TPM is the worst, hands down. But if you compare it to other movies that have come out in the past few years, come ON. Would you rather watch TPM or Charlie's Angels? I didn't LOVE TPM, but I don't hate it either. The acting ranges from sucky to great, the sfx are the best, the script could use some work and the fights can't be beat."
3,Make Jar-Jar more serious & it'll be better,"A promising movie but somewhat dismal. Great SFX however. The ""opening story"" of the ""Star Wars"" saga. John Williams' score saves the movie. The Pod race steals the show."
2,question?,"I have 1 question why are all of you buying it when you hate film. every one whines about it but your buying it. i didnt really like this film and i am not buying it. make a good purchase like the GODFATHERS or snatch. this is no EMPIRE, this isnt even jedi and jedi was the worst until this. the same with battlefeild earth it got up to like number five and jurasic park three its like six, and both roaly suck. and every one thinks it sucks but you are buying them, as a whise man once said if you stop seeing and buy sucky movies they will make less of them. so take my advise dont buy this cause it sucks.ps empire rules"
5,i love the prequel trilogy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i loved episode 1 the phantom menace the only thing i didnt like about this movie was the actor they choose to be anakin skywalker this movie rocks tho its one of my favorite movies
5,The Saga Began and The Service Was Outstanding,"Although not my favorite film of the Star Wars Saga by a long shot, it was still necessary to purchase to complete my collection. The product arrived quickly and in the condition the seller had stated (really, only a small fuzz in one scene lasting about 5 seconds)-I was expecting much worse so was pleasantly surprised. The order was handled professionally and the service was great. Thank you very much!"
2,Cinematography can't hold up a bad story.,"Cheers and congratulations are in order for ILM's masterful work on this movie, but here's the problem: The story wasn't thought out enough and bores it's way to the Jedi duel. Lucas should have paid attention when constructing sets that look more modern than the original (Star Trek's Enterprise could do the same in some areas). There is too much backstory to be told and I'm sure the script didn't allow enough running time to delve deep into Anakin, the Jedi Council, or even Yoda. There are a lot of things we still don't know, and maybe would if the pod race & Jar Jar weren't taking up that time..."
5,It doesn&#65533;t make you cool to dislike this movie,"If you genuinely don't like this movie, I understand. If you are saying that you don't like it but claim to be a Star Wars fan, I don't buy it. It was fashionable to be 27+ years old and claim to have seen the Trilogy a hundred times but bash this movie in the same breath last summer. Get over yourself and knock it off. I am a fan. I like the first installments, and I like this movie too. I have seen this movie a dozen times on the screen and a few times on the TV at home. True the big screen is the best forum for viewing and DVD would be the ultimate medium for the home viewer, but this is the only option at this time. I accept this. I choose not to complain. When the DVD is released, I will rejoice. In the meantime I will sit on the couch, pop some popcorn and enjoy the ride."
2,Did anyone notice.....?,"Did anyone notice that the technology was better in the earlier days then the later years. I mean if this is a prequel then the technology would be far less advanced, correct? Not much to say on it otherwise. I was completely lost in the plot, nor did I bother to find out what is was about when it was over."
2,Star Wars underwent a major metamorphesis,"Ever since I saw Star Wars for the first time, I was impressed and immediately was taken to a distinct and varied universe that spawned a new franchise in my life. Unfortunately, hype has repeated itself and Lucas gave anticipating audiences a dramatic decline in what anyone could call an epic. Maybe the most anticipated cinematic event in the history of filmmaking, but far from the great film. The pod race is worth the admission alone, but as for an unoriginal story and horrible use of the Star Wars license, this movie just doesn't cut it, and you'll find yourself surprisingly sleeping through half of it."
1,It needs to be on DVD,"Come on George Lucas, quit being money hungry and just release this movie on DVD. We all know that Lucas is only wanting people to buy it on tape now, than have to buy it all over again on DVD in a few months or years. Come on, this movie was meant to be in the DVD format, quit witholding it! Other than that not so minor complaint, the movie is great, and I definitely WILL NOT buy it until it's released on DVD. I aint that dumb. I'm not going to buy the same movie twice."
5,YEAH!,"Lucasdefinetly hit the bullseye this time, episode 1 was the best, most exciting movie of the year, and the 2nd best star wars film of all time (my fav is return of the jedi). The only mistake lucas made with episode 1 was JarJar, i really dont like him. A very good story line and great SFX. BUY THIS VIDEO!"
3,Could have been so much better,Weak plot and to much Jar Jar is what really hurt this movie.The special effects were fantastic as was the fight scene with Darth Maul.As a stand alone movie it does not hold up well.If the rest of the trilogy is excellent this will make Episode I only a decent opening act.
3,The elders wanted it - but it's made for the younger crowd,"George was trying too hard to make this film accessible to kids. But he must have known that everyone who spent 10 years of wondering (and an additional 6 years eagerly awaiting, once Lucas' outlines were leaked on the Internet in '94) was his ""target market."" This film is still a marvel. However, I wonder if Lucas will gloss over the imminent genocide in Episode 3 with more cute characters a la Jar Jar Binks. Genocide is not something you can gloss-over, George. I pray that Episode 3 is a dark and gritty film for teens and adults only. Lucas definately needs help in the screenplay department. In the meantime, we should enjoy the two sequences on Episode I that will stand the test of time: The Pod Race, and the final lightsaber duels. Amazing stuff!"
2,A real let down,"Being a great Star Wars fan most of my short life, this movie was a real let down. The special effects were good, but that's about where it ends. The characters needed some major developement work. The plot didn't have any reason for being. Compared to the early works of George Lucas, this was .... Even so, if you are a true Star Wars fan, it's a must see, even if it ruins some of your ideals."
3,Home theater disappointment,"(technical review - No story review)I am sure this film looks great on a small to medium sized screen, If you are a home theater owner, you will be unhappy in the detail of this film. At times this movie becomes fuzzy and makes this print a disappointment, I would expect more from a THX labeled film. I can only guess that this is, ether poor mastering or DVD limitations. Other than lack of detail in the film all other aspects of the image were great. The sound was fine.Picture quality 3.5 Sound quality 5"
3,It was kind of strange,It was ok but what i think is weird is Padme is older than Anakin. I mean she is like 10 years older than him. i think it would have been better if they were the same age. if any one agrees with me my name is naomi and you can send me a response.
2,"""Star Wars"" Slips Far, Far Away From Fun","""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" comes nowhere near the greatness of the original trilogy. The fun and humor has been drained out of the story and replaced by computer animated horror Jar Jar Binks. The story follows young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn as they attempt to stop the Trade Federation. It is nice to see how the ""Star Wars"" saga began, but without such memorable characters as Princess Leia, Han Solo, or Darth Vader, it just isn't the same. The special effects are brilliant and the DVD fascinated many people, but director/writer George Lucas didn't thrill me with the serousness of the plot."
1,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED,This movie could not stand alone. Way too weak in plot and character development. Do like Natalie but her playing dual roles is too much. Often her voice is robot/carboard like. Only reason to purchase this is because it is the first of the Star Wars series.
1,Jar Jar Stinks,"WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED? I just can't believe it, after nearly 16 years the whole STAR WARS saga has been reduced to this kiddie fare nonsense! It seems to me like George Lucas should've had his mid-life crisis a LONG time ago. Especially with Jar Jar Stinks! ""Duhr,duhr,you'sa people gonna die?"" Well I was just about to after I saw this movie. I now wonder if George Lucas has gone to the dark side.?"
5,It's a child movie,"If you want to see a child's dream of the future and an annoying creature, this is it. It was a good movie if you can relate to young Anakin. It didn't have that spark from the original three and it was an attempt to bring on the younger viewers. I just wish that Jar Jar Binks didn't exist, annoying creature."
1,Star Wars - Episode I,"This movie lacks all the elements that made the series popular in the first place. i was just flipping through HBO channels and this came on. I figured i would watch it since Star Wars is sick, but it was hardly what i expected. So many chiches, and i didnt feel an attachment for any of the characters."
2,A Long Long Time Ago....,Pod Race good; Jar Jar Binks bad. Ewan MacGregor good; Jake Lloyd bad. Special effects good; acting bad. Lightsaber duels good; Anakin's virgin birth bad. Empire Strikes Back really good; The Phantom Menace really bad.
3,Phantom Menace ? or just a boring menace?,Simple and to the point. The film is quite enjoyable and watchable however the technology used with computer effects does not have the same touch and chararistic star wars class we all loved in the old triology. Also there were some real boring bits in the film which resembled more of a story line from Babylon 5.
4,A truly dazzling visual tour nevertheless,"I'm very sorry to hear that this movie fell short of George Lucas's hopeful expectations, but it has its truly inspiring moments anyhow. The action sequences will truly take your breath away as well as the eye-popping ariel shooting of the majestic cities that may one day represent our own cities several thousand years from now. And the young queen who ascended the throne so early in her life is the most fascinating character of all, with her really bizarre hairdos and her plucky exploits. The story, however drags on a little and I did squirm about in my seat at those times. In addition, there are some pretty silly parts like the king of the swamp shaking his jowls until his spittle flies everywhere and a desert mount suddenly breaking wind for no good reason. But the special effects, especially produced by the sophisticated computer technology of the '90s are quite beautiful and awe-inspiring to watch. So go enjoy the ride nevertheless!"
5,Phantom Menace Rocks!,"OK - at 20 years old, whne the originals came out I was too young to see them in the movie theater. This was incredible. I think those who hated this movie wanted some kind of Sci-Fi religious experience, not a movie, made to be enjoyed by the whole family. Jar Jar Binks may have been annoying to some people, but the kids I know loved him. This is a MOVIE. Not some kind of Sci-Fi convention. It was meant to be enjoyed, not analysed, and I enjoyed it very much."
3,"Take the longer view, perhaps","Sure, I agree that this movie was a disappointment with shallow characterizations and too much technology overshadowing the human element and making it seem cartoonish, however... The first trilogy must ultimately form a tragedy in the traditional sense. It must show a great man achieve success prior to a fall brought about by his own arrogance. If this character is Anakin, then I am surprised that we don't see the seed of his flaw in the first movie (if he is rash and capable of cruelty, it would have been nice to see him exhibit this in the pod race scene by meeting Sebulba's violence with his own), but if the tragic character is Obi-Wan, then this first movie works rather well since it moves him into a scenerio which he is too young and overconfident to manage. Seen as a first act, the movie works because it presents the world of light, youth, and innocence that the sequels must tear down."
1,Come on man! Be wise. Don't watch that!,"A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! This film was a complete waste of time. For these 2 1/2 hours i could have washed my teeth, called my boring old grandma and watched the beginning 'Gone With The Wind' fot 153th time and still i would have had more fun. First I should say that i would have given this film -5 stars if that was possible. The characters are flat likea blackboard. Jar-Jar Binks is stupid. Anakin shows an IQ of 50 points or less. The two good Jedis walkedaround like two boredcops tryingtofind someoneto knock down. They were so dumb, that inthe end i sympathised Darth Maul. He was the only guy inthe film who, despite being stupid, won my sympathy. On the whole this film is not worth watching if you want to see a logical film or at least something which has some kind ofa normal storyline."
2,Didn't quite do it for me,"Although I enjoyed the look of ""The Phantom Menace,"" and found many of the characters intriguing, the overall impact fell just short of 3 stars or my idea of the positive zone. There simply isn't enough depth to the story or characters to enable me to suspend my belief in the face of the unconvincing and slightly ridiculous Star Wars mythology. Maybe the point is not to pay attention to this stuff at all but I can't be satisfied by great action scenes and some nifty sci-fi settings alone."
2,Weak script was the real menace,"A lot of sound and fury... signifying NOTHING. The first clue that Lucas didn't have a compelling idea for this film was the mind-numbing ""crawl"" at the beginning of the film. The Pod Race: nothing more than a vapid video game on the big screen. J.J. Binks? More annoying than the Ewoks. Let's get back to the great storytelling and human dimension of the first two films!"
2,What a disapointment,"I consider myself a big star wars fan, and I wish I didn't waste my money on this DVD. The hype on this is very over rated. All the news on the deleted sense being so great. They were ok but the better ones of course were on the second disk and not part of the movie at all. Who was the idiot that decided that one? I don't know about anyone else but I buy DVD's to see the deleted sense during the movie not separate! Save your money. It's not worth it unless you are a die-hard fan but even then be prepared to be disappointed."
2,"Watchable, but bad acting ruins the movie","The movie on the whole manages to paint a wonderful picture of the world before the evil empire takes control. The all star cast do a good job, but it is not enough to overcome the flat acting of Jake Lloyd. The special effects are wonderful and the battle scenes surpass the first three. Unfortunately, there's a lot of history and myth to the star wars universe. If the first three episodes of star wars didn't exist, the movie would get a higher rating. The movie is entertaining and fun, but sadly lacks depth and mystery."
2,MARKETING GENIUS !,"George Lucas is a marketing genius. He build a fanastic climax to a history that is, at his best, a simple one. Full of special effects, there are several unforgivable flaws: 1) the movie is clearly made for everyone from ages 9 to 80. No deaths, nothing politically ""Incorrect""; 2) Jar Jar Binks is disgusting; 3) THe boy who plays young Anakin is as bad as actor as he can be. I don't understand how he was cast."
3,Dazzling Special Effects but.....,"I just wanted to start out saying that I am a big Star Wars fan, owning the orginal trilogy and a few cheesy pieces of Star Wars merchandise. I went to the theatre the 2nd day of its long awaited release. In one word: disappointed! I know the special effects were awesome. With the great pod racing scene and lightsaber dual against Darth Maul. Thats what made it get three stars. The acting was nothing respectable and rather corny. Anakin's ""Yippe"" had less enthusiasm then my keyboard does. I would buy this but only settled for a viewing in the theatre and a rental because no DVD! Which is very upsetting. George Lucas, you are losing sales with a no dvd decision, including mine!"
2,the special effects were cool...,"Darth Vader built C3PO? Gimme a break! Having R2 in the flick was ok because nobody in the audiance ever really knows what R2 knows in any of the movies. But the Golden Droid C3PO doesn't have a clue in the original Star Wars- yet here he is at the beginning of it all. The little kid was way too amazing, the ""Battle Droids"" were way too easy to take out, and Darth Maul could have been a good villain for episode 2 had he survived this flick. Definately the weakest movie in the series (so far)."
1,Star Wars: Phantom Menace (widescreen),"The video transfer looks AWFUL! Very sub-standard. I'm very disappointed. Looks like a second generation recording. I'd wait for DVD release, or if you own a laserdisc player, bid on the Japanese LD version at eBay.com"
2,This Movie is a Menace,This movie is not that good compared to the Star Wars Trilogy. George Lucas should have spent more time on plannig episode One. The good parts are seeing Yoda again and a bunch of new faces. But Stars Episode One does not seem like it leads up to its trilogy.
5,The mythos works!!!!!,"Id first like to say that this film was a great way to begin the saga of the Skywalkers. I saw the original Star Wars 26 years ago and have been an avid fan ever since. I have a very dissatisfied view of the critics and to those fans who feel this film is garbage!! The main point I want to make is that Mr. Lucas can do what he wants, and I support him fully in all Episodes he creates for this fantastic Star Wars Saga. Way to go George and keep them coming. By the way, for those of you who say the writing is terrible and the acting is wooden, take a look back at the original three films reviews and you will amazingly discover that back then, THEY SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT THOSE FILMS AS WELL. Please enjoy the story people and appreciate it for what it is, a fantastic Myth with the power to take you to a galaxy far, far, away"
5,A Must Have Classic,"No matter how people might have been disappointed with the movie, I believe that it is a great movie overall and it is the beginning of the saga. OK, the pod-race was really too long and Jar Jar Binks was slightly annoying but the film contained several great scenes as well. It is overall very exciting by itself and also as a part of the whole saga.The DVD contains very interesting interviews with almost everyone and additional shootage. The images are clear, the sound spectacular and it is really a must have for the dedicated.This is the only Phantom Menace we will have for a very very long time. So get it now and keep it for a lifetime."
4,Phantom Menace-Like it or not,"Lucas stayed true to his vision, rather than to fans of Star Wars. Maybe this means that while the movie perhaps could have been better, the story could not. For this Lucas is to be commended. You can find links to various Star Wars sites"
1,It just isn't good,"Yeah, I wathed this movie and was definitely disappointed. First of all i don't see how people could go so CRAZY over Darth Maul, he was such a big thing to everybody yet he was in the movie like 5 times or something, and a total of like 10 min. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but I don't even remember him talkig! So it dosn't make sense to me to go so wild over that wierd person. I also did not like Anikan Skywalker. He just had bad acting. He also had a bad scrip too, but mostly it was the acting. The character just wasn't realistic, he didn't act like a real 8 or 9 year old boy. Well, in my opinion don't waste you're money renting this movie, get something good like the real Star Wars for instance."
1,Even kids find it cheesy,The movie was CORNY. don't bother if you don't have it. you're not missing much.
3,A Good movie Over comercialized!,"All die-hard fans cannot help but love this pre-continuation of the saga. The story line was good and the actors filled the rolls perfectly. While I agree with other reviews that the special effects were great; they seemed a little over done. The under-water scenes and especially the grassy field battle scene were just too much. I think the lack of using life-size props and scale models took away from some of the realism that the old films carried. It is also sad to see that with our technology advances the spacecraft looks more high-tech than the stuff in the first films, causing the story line to be out of kilter."
2,very rude,In my feedback i simply stated that the item i order was a bit pricey which it was however i still purchased the item cause i thought it was worth it well after posting my feedback i got a very rude email from the seller in which point he said not to buy from him again so if you like rude sellers then i guess this is the guy to buy from but personally im a nice person And i would expect the same after all i did buy from them thanks
2,"Phantom Plot, Acting, Writing, Integrity","Besides the gripping lightsaber duel there is no reason at all to see this sorry excuse for a movie.George Lucas has sold out completely - especially with Jar-Jar. He was always in it for the money, with the merchandising avalanche of the first trilogy. But, at least there were some redeeming qualities in the first three movies. Ep 1 is simply garbage. The countless millions he spent on the boring pod race and the cliche ""blow up the big enemy ship"" would've been better spent on a script-writer (or maybe a whole team of them). How humiliating for McGregor and Neeson to be tied to such a third-rate production.Save your money and go see The Lord of The Rings this winter- Tolkien's trilogy is a thousand times better - with much more interesting characters, plot and no pander-to-the-8-year-olds Jar Jar character."
3,"Really liked it, but...","I really liked this movie, but there are a lot of things that could have been added if it came in DVD format. Like director/actor commentaries, Web links, image slides and all those fun stuff that you can squeeze in a DVD disc. Don't take this in a negative way, but if only people did not buy the VHS version and demanded for a DVD, they will surely come up with one."
2,Hmmmm....,"Oh yeah!!! Star Wars is coming to DVD!! October 16 can't get here fast enough!! Six hours of extra stuff!! The time we have all waited for has finally arri...Oh wait, never mind. It's actually Episode 1 that is coming out on DVD, perhaps the biggest disappointment in film history. So sorry for the false alarm. I guess it's back to waiting until Lucas gets off his butt and releases the original trilogy, movies that were actually good."
3,A substantial disappointment....,"Okay, I was just like everyone else--I wanted to see this movie really really badly. So I did. And at first I thought it was great! But later, I realized how very childish this movie is. Sure, the visual effects were nice, and the pod race was cool, but the visuals can't compare with The Matrix. Also, Jar Jar Binks and Boss Nass are a very unwelcome addition, with their very eyeball-rolling senses of humor. And the plot wasn't very clever either. It's really pretty hard to relate this movie to the Trilogy. If you're anyone under 13 (as I was when I saw it), you should like at the very least like it, as long as you don't expect it to be like the old Star Wars. But if you are an adult who is a big fan of the Trilogy, avoid The Phantom Menace at all costs.Rated PG, for sci-fi action and violence, not much else, really everyone should be allowed to see it. But the question remains: does EVERYONE really WANT TO?"
1,What a total steaming stream of chunky Diarrhea!,"I tried to like it, I really did. It's Star Wars for Cripes sake! At first I was stunned, then sad, then just angry! In defense of Lucas, I think he had a stroke or something and now he's retarded. There really isn't any other explaination. It was like a porn film, only without the sex, script or acting! I felt dumber for watching it and it pisses me off that I'll never get those 2 hours of my life back.I thought it was a fluke so when the Attack of the Clones came out, I, like a complete dumbass, went to see it. Needless to say, now there are 4 hours of my life gone with nothing to show for it. I could have spent that time slamming my testicals in a door jam or trying to score at the nursing home.Should I even bother seeing the Revenge of the Sith? I think I'll wait till it comes to TV, not cable, UPN or the WB! Why should I fork out 10 bucks for that crap, when I could spend that money on some crack."
2,Sad,"I was really sad when I heard rumors that the DVD version might not come out now till 2006. What is Lucas thinking, this movie was made in digital and DVD is digital. I bought the widescreen version and I'm still sad about the quailty of the picture. Comon George wake up."
1,Give me a break,"Come on people. I was a kid when the the REAL star wars movies came out. Now I show them to my son and they rock...we have a blast and the darn things are almost 30 years old. This recent garbage from Lucas shows he SHOULD NOT be directing adult films!!!! They are flat and lack ANY of the emotional buy-in needed for a legend film series. The orginal series was so good that it became part ""religion"" to many people. They were so good, you had a frenzy when these new movies were coming out. The orginal movies were made for adults with a story so compelling, you didn't need 100 million in special effects to pull it off. Lucas should have done what he did with the first series...let other people direct them! What a disgrace to the orginal Star Wars trilogy. I think that's the point...the original Star Wars was an adult film that was good for some kids too. The new Star Wars is simply a kids series that seems laughable when it tries to get serious for a few minutes."
1,Garbage,"This movie is a depressing waste of time for any true Star Wars fan. The story is incoherent, the acting is weak, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying Star Wars character ever, Jake Lloyd's Anakin is a close second, and the fact that half movie revolves around the pod race, which is really just an excuse to show off special effects technology, makes this the worst Star Wars movie of all! I'll never forget how amazingly dissappointed I was when I first saw this. It lacks all the spirit of the originals, and is a soulless phony."
2,"disapointing, but not without some merit","first off, I am a big Star Wars fan, and was quite excited about this movie. Unfortunately I was disapointed. Certainly the film is not without merit, there are some great action scenes, and special effects. The movie is also not without a few good characters. Unfortunately though the movie is almost 100% eye candy. The characters could have been much better than they were. Jar Jar Binks is a commonly used example, and for good reason. He could have been an enjoyable comic relief character, but instead he was just intolerably irritating.Then there is the pod race, a scene which got a lot more focus than necessary, which left me feeling like Lucas just wanted to throw in something to take up time. This could have been a good film with a bit more focus on character developement, and plot, and some better acting (though not all of it was terrible)."
5,Star Wars - Episode I - The Phamton Menace,I have been a Star Wars fan for years and I was very excited to see this prequel. The DVD is packed with extras and very cool. Can't wait for Episode III.
3,The Force is not with this one,"Episode 1 pales in comparison to the original trilogy. The CGI is well done, but someone forgot to tell Mr. Lucas that this is a movie, not a video game. The acting is bad. Jake Lloyd as Anakin, really annoyed me. I also can't forget Jar Jar(shudder).The only good things about this movie are 1.) The pod race and 2.) The lightsaber duel at the end.It's only because of the overall DVD package, that this movie got a rating of 3. Without the extras, that would only leave you the movie, itself. Lets just say that Episode 1, by itself, is worth just that, a 1. Thank goodness for DVD."
2,Mediocre in all but Special Effects,"This first of three prequels to the Star Wars trilogy is big on special effects (indeed it deserved to win an Oscar in this category but had to make do with noms for Visual Effects, Sound and Sound Effects) but mediocre in terms of any human qualities, story interest or humor. It's dreadfully serious and uninvolving and rather formulaic - geared more for children than for adults. Not as deserving as the trilogy itself. For Star Wars groupies only."
1,Disappointing.,"What a letdown. I'm a diehard Star Wars fan, and I can't tell you how mediocre this film is. My heart started pounding with excitement when the opening music blared and the Star Wars logo appeared on the screen. It was all downhill from there. The much-hyped pod racer scene is dull and free of suspense- how many laps are left? Who's ahead? You can never tell, so after a while- who cares? Can't hold a candle to the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi- or any scene in the original trilogy for that matter. Liam Neeson's and Ewan McGregor's talents are totally wasted. Natalie Portman's performance is wooden, and what's with that accent? The computer generated effects are distracting and cartoonish. The finale is laughable. What a bummer. I think I'll skip Episode II. :("
2,WHY WERE SCENES EDITED!,"The regular tape has poor video and sound quality relative to most other movies, the Widescreen or ""Letterbox"" version is much better. However, both versions have scenes edited out, mostly subtle but one scene which explains how Darth Maul traced the good guys to Tatooin was removed. As for the script, it is good for kids, but rather flawed for ""intelligent"" adults. References of Anakin as ""Jesus Christ"", and linking it (the Force) to something that can be measured in blood, as well as ""Barney"" style acting by the boy ruined the movie for me. As for the DVD issue, nevermind that there is NO DVD of ANY Lucas Films, the original Star Wars Trilogy is not even commercially available any more in any format, this and the removal of scenes from both vhs release of Phantom Menace, tells me that Mr. Lucas has truly turned to the ""Dark Side"" of capitalism. Disney style."
4,My least favorite one of the 6 episodes but still satisfying,This one Cannot compare with A New Hope nor The Empire strikes Back most critics say but I Say it is still a worthy film in the saga and is still satisfying
5,Cheap and fast,I just got this to replace my Fiancé's VHS copy and on Christmas morning she was happy to see that I had replaced it because her VHS copy started showing wear. Fast shipping and the DVD was cheap too!
3,Wither Jake Lloyd . . . Please,"I have rated this DVD based upon what I would think of it IF I saw it. I had high hopes that when Lucas put out the DVD, he would finally find somebody who could act and take him to the studio to dub his voice over Jake Lloyd's. No such luck. So, I won't be buying this DVD, because if I can't stand to watch the movie again -- and Lloyd makes it absolutely unbearable to watch -- there's no sense owning the DVD, special features or not. (And, yes, I used ""wither"" in my title because that is what I wished Lloyd had done in the Libyan desert.)"
3,For those with eyes to see and ears to hear...,"George Lucas had unprecedented control over this film. Never before has one man had such technical expertise, financial resource, guaranteed audience, and absolute unquestioned authority to bring his singular artistic vision to the screen, therefore all praise or criticism justifiably lays squarely at his feet alone. The conclusion... The Emperor wears no clothes."
2,too much folklore mixed with bad science,"I understand that folktales reach out to us because they are familar to us, yet I can't help but wish that Lucas would do something new and different. I have no idea why the Jar Jar character is here, no idea why they felt the need to explain the ""force"" in bad psuedo-science terms, and little respect for something that seems more geered toward making money off of toys than entertaining an audience. I was very very disappionted."
4,By any other name...,"This was THE most hyped movie in recent years. People stood in line for MONTHS just for the chance to buy tickets. I even took the day off work to watch it two times. Was it a good movie? Hell yeah! Was it the best Star Wars film? No, it wasn't. Does it capture the essence and the magic of Star Wars? I think it did.There were some things that really worked in this movie (like the lightsaber duel *droooool*), and some things that didn't work (Jar-Jar, Artoo predictably saving the ship, etc), but if this movie had been released as the first in its series, it would have been met by rave reviews, and not the mixed ones we're seeing here.I'm now waiting for Episode II and III. I wanna see the lightsaber battle at the volcano, dammit! :)"
5,Very good movie!,This movie is top hit for 1999. All the actors did very well I thought even though some people may disagree on this I thought Star Wars The Phantom Menace was the best movie made in along time. I am just cazy about Star Wars and highly give it two thumbs up way up. To all people you got to see this movie it is the best and you won't turn it down. The two jedi's also did very well Thanks to George Lucas.
3,Worth a viewing.,"The Phantom Menace is pretty good, but I don't find it to be a classic. I've watched it a handful of times. There are some things that could be better. The special effects are the most impressive aspect (The action isn't bad either.). All of the various creatures throughout the movie are interesting also. One thing about The Phantom Menace that is disappointing is the lack of character development. Liam Neeson's character is an example of this (The same goes for Darth Maul.). Something else that should be better is the plot--it isn't too captivating. As for Jar Jar Binks, I have no problem with him. He doesn't irritate me at all. This film has some good qualities to it. It's not as good as the other films in the series though. I don't consider The Phantom Menace to be boring. Any movie that I can watch more than once isn't too bad. Worth a viewing."
5,Best DVD of the year!!!,"It was absolutly worth the wait. 6 hours of xtra material and even the movie was updated with small scenes here and there. You get alot for your money, and i truly recomende it for everybody out there in the world.P.S Im really 17, but i didnt wanna make an acount. Peace!"
1,Embarasing,These new star wars movies are an embarasement to Lucas. Nothing but lipservice to the first trilogy. A disgrace with no merit of their own.
1,George Lucas...lucky (...),"I knew we were in for something bad with ""Phantom Menace"" when you look at what he did to the original trilogy a short time earlier. Listen folks, all you need to know is this: George Lucas has NO CONCEPT of what makes a movie good. All he cares about is filling the screen with unneeded special effects, many of which are hard to look at because they stand out so much. I will not comment on ""Jar-Jar"" specifically because it's no more ridiculous than the hundreds of other things in this movie. Save you money. If you want to buy your kids a nice ""kids movie"" I'd suggest ""Toy Story(1 or 2)"" or ""Shrek"". Heck, I've seen Saturday morning cartoons that had tighter stories than ""Phantom Menace"". (...) I have to assume that ""Star Wars"" was a lucky accident for you. Here's a tip for you: look into making the next ""Final Fantasy"" instead. (...)"
1,Worst Film I Have Ever Seen,This film defines boredom. How anyone could love it is beyond me...much less watch extras about the hideous making of a cinematic atrocity. George Lucas has directed the dullest film ever. EVER. I wanted to shut this thing off twenty minutes into it and forced myself to watch it. It is even more boring than 2001: A Space Odyssey...and that is next to impossible. But of course what can you expect from the man who brought the world such trash as Willow and Howard the Duck. I HATE this film and am so glad that SHREK is outselling it on DVD. I would rather watch Chesty Morgan movies ad naseum than to ever sit through this void on celluloid again. Anyone who likes it is welcome to it but don't ever try to go on a date with me. I'll send you packing.
1,Virtually Unwatchable,"This movie is so unbelievably bad, it is almost unwatchable. The characters were forgettable, the plot ridiculous, and I *hate* movies where some Whiz Kid is the hero. My friend brought his 2 children, aged 4 and 5, which was good, since the entire movie was aimed toward them. Almost all of the special effects money went to creating aliens who were virtually unconnected to the plot. When the Jedi was killed near the end I thought, ""who cares"" since I couldn't even remember his NAME at that point. On the drive home, I realized that I couldn't name the alien with the big ears, or the Queen or Princess or whoever she was. And I had just seen the movie! If all of them had been killed, I would have just shrugged. The plot, along with the ridiculously bad writing and acting, made it impossible to care about them. A truly pathetic successor to the brilliant original trilogy."
1,Worthless until Jar Jar can be COMPLETELY deleted,"In short, this DVD will not be worth owning until there is the option to totally delete Jar Jar Binks from the movie. There was nothing wrong with the Gungans - in fact, I rather liked them (the normal ones that you could understand when they spoke, and who weren't shuffling, stumbling, mumbling idiots).As a point of reference - I've seen Episodes 4, 5, & 6 together more than 100 times, and have over 50 sci-fi movies in my DVD collection, but I'll never own or watch Episode 1 again until Jar Jar can be erased."
1,Enough already,"A short time ago, a group of reviewers picked Phantom Menace as the worst sequel of all times. Wrong. It is the worst prequel of all times. Thin plot (essentially no plot reversals). The information theory people would say that the predictability of the action makes it an ""information-free"" medium. Come on, Mr. Lucas, we've had enough of this insipid fare. Give up and admit that the first three exhausted your studio's creativity. Hang up the light sabre."
4,"Star Wars Episode 1, The Worst?","First off, i just want to tell you why i gave this movie 4 stars. i didn't compare it with other star wars. but with other movies. it got 5 stars against other movies and only 3 against other star wars hence the 4. I highly recomend you buy this on dvd! i have it on vhs it is good but the sound could be better. and if you are like me you want it really bad in widscreen for the podrace and space battle as well as the entire movie.I personally thought it was the second best movie in the star wars series. but for 22 some dollars it is deffinatly worth the buy. Now for the good and bad. The good is the podrace and the end battles. The bad is the story. the story lacked what other star wars movies have. Another thing is jar jar binks, i wish they had had a human in a suit on makeup instead of cgi. I am not saying it isn't bad it just has that rubbery feeling to it.Bottam line. BUY IT AS SOON AS IT COMES OUT BECAUSE IT IS DEFFINATLY ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!"
2,Star Wars ruined,I never could have imagined o worse episode to the series. Where has the soul of the first films gone... This movie was the worst and i hope it will stay that way it was awfull (except the bad guys) after seeing the movie all i could thing was that i must have watched the wrong movie but then you will have to watch it just becouse it is a star wars movie lucas should have done better...
5,Better than expected,"For those of you that though that this movie was ""A failure... Not as good as the first three... or was just plain a bad movie with a lousy plot"" I just have a few words for you, YOU HAVE NO IMAGINATION this was in fact what it was a PREQUEL not the a similar movie or a remake to the Orignal. George made an excellent movie setting up what is sure to be the best installment of the franchise. This film is justing setup the ground work for the rest (and this is what most people that don't like it don't understand, it even sets up the orginal trilogy). Remember Star Wars was a story that stated in the middle. And we are FINALY experiancing the begining..."
2,The phantom menace in the arse!,(SPEAKING FOR ANOTHER PERSON. WAYNE BRYDON: I had high hopes for this film and was enjoying the film up until the point where Jar Jar bloody binks appeared. The character had absolutely no point at all and made a potentially good film a large turd in the toilet bowl of bad films. Where were the space scenes? (a brief 5 minutes). Most annoyingly of all little Anakin Skywalker was a good actor. The film would have got 4 stars out of 5 but because of Jar Jar it gets 2.
2,One Redeeming Grace,"It's interesting. Star Wars, a series that Mark Hamill's acting couldn't kill, was laid low by it's own creator. The Phantom Menace took a formerly great series and disolved it into a stream of slapstick, pod racing, and Jar-Jar Binks. Some thoughts: why are the battle robots given weapons that are seperate from themselves? Why aren't the built into the hardware? Also, why do these death robots use normal speach to talk to each other, and why do they look like people instead of a form that kills more efficently?However, it does warrant a second star. Why? For one part: the Duel of the Fates, a John Williams-underscored fight sequence on par with the better moments of Star Wars. If the rest of the film had been on that level, The Phantom Menace might have been the best of the series. Instead, it is regared, by and large, as the worst."
2,"""I have a bad feeling about this""","The most famous phase in a Star Wars movie is ""I have a bad feeling about this"" and its made by Obi-Wan (Ewan McGreggor) and i can't decide if he's talking about the movie itself, or the annoying Jar Jar Binks.Great DVD, so-so movie."
2,I have a bad feeling about this . . .,"A mediocre begining to the Star Wars saga. It seems like it is aimed at children too much for adults to care about it. Also missing is the sharp irreverance that the first films had. Lucas' dialogue reads like it is to be acted with the same importance of Shakespears. Even more offensive is the Steppin'-Fetchit Jar-Jar Binks. A character that is so annoying you hope that he gets killed off. Soon. Please. What the film really lacks is a strong, menacing evil figure (similar to Darth Vader) to contrast the good. The evil in the film is almost amibigously dull. Overall, nice special effects but a cardboard story."
2,"ahhh, can't hate lucas","...rely on the extensive documentaries/featurettes (disc 2) to help convince yourself that this film has 'some' redeeming value...the excessive quantity of dvd extras (actually more entertaining/intriguing than the movie itself) tries to dazzle/numb you into forgeting/rationalizing your profound disappointment in the movie...so maybe it's a rough start, but bringing star wars up to speed with 'contemporary action/sci-fi movie standards' and 'expectation pressures' (especially from the SW over-intellectualizers) is a pretty formidable task.be wary tho and try to ignore the sickeningly profuse lucas kow-tow-ing by his legion of payroll sycophants/workhorse zombies.tho Quantity over quality is the essence of this dvd, how can i turn my back completely on someone responsible for so much of my childhood joy?all starwars fans are forever indebted to lucas for the cherished memories... it's his story, after all."
1,Disappointment,"People claim that it would have been impossible for this Star Wars to live up to the expectations from the previous movies. I believe that they are just looking for excuses for why this movie is as bad as it is. Lucas' main flaw was trying to target the movie towards eight year olds (ie ""humor"" used, Jar Jar, etc.) Another disappointment was the acting. Liam Neeson is about the only actor pulling his weight in this movie, and that simply isn't enough to cut it. The performances of Anakin and his mother feel totally unbelievable and Queen Amidala continually has a ""pained to take the effort to say these lines"" expression. This DVD is barely worth renting, simply for the extras and the fact that this is an episode in the Star Wars series. Other than that, don't buy it."
3,"Silly Rabbit, Star Wars are for Kids - Too Bad","Star Wars is facinating due to its ability to adapt and modernize traditional mythic motifs so that they speak to us in the 20th - 21st centuries. George Lucas has proved to be a master at this. Darth Maul is actually more impressive than Darth Vader. To this he deserves much credit. However, after creating such a vivid environment and such wonderful characters he dedicates a good portion of this movie to deliberatley dumbed down characters like Jar-Jar Binks and the Trade Federation cronies. It is like watching Roger Rabbit and Elmer Fudd plodding along in a Warner Brothers cartoon. This is really a temendous movie leaves you feeling a little on the dark side."
2,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD,I looooooooooooooooowed the first ones and first i lowed this one but only becous i wantwed to lowe it. Wach the phantom manace and than one of the first one. Goerge Lucas was just thinking about the effects not directing or the script.
3,The only way to watch THE PHANTOM MENACE,"With a movie that is all about special effects, the only way tosee it is the WIDESCREEN version. People who buy the PAN AND SCANversion that is fitted to your television will miss millions of dollars in digital landscapes. It's like missing parts of a painting. And with a thin plot and almost zero character development you will need all the eye candy available to you to get through THE PHANTOM MENACE. Not exactly as much fun as watching Luke, Leia, and Han race against time to get rid of all-time baddie Darth Vader -- infact, this movie comes nowhere near the original trilogy's charm which was as much about the great young cast as the special effects. Now 22 years later we get computer effects that make your jaw drop, and a bunch of actors lost in a blue screen. But for what it's worth -- it's an amusing ride, if not all that the original was."
2,"Dispite the rating I gave, the ""boring"" song MUST be sung!","(Takes out guitar) Boring...Boring...Boring...Boring... Sigh. Is...there a point to this movie? No!!!!! I mean, there's no plot-and if there was, it is really, really bad. I remember loyal fans of the epic triolgy were even sleeping outside movie theaters-all for this? Let me say, the acting (Expect that Anakin :0...) and directory was good-except for the story-which is the one that makes the movie come alive. Ah, you gotta hate it when legendary directors direct crappy movies-it's insulting. In other words...the polt sucked."
1,Where is the DVD version?,"Very disappointing to see there is no dvd version planned. I don't even own a vcr any longer. If you have listened to any movie on both dvd & vhs formats you will understand my grief---I can just imagine how spectacular the sight & sound would be. George, it's time to get into the digital age wouldn't you think?"
3,It had to be told.,"As a huge fan of Star Wars, I was disappointed with the acting in this movie. In the first three movies ever made the cast had character, memorable character, and this movie doesn't have the same flair. However, the story had to be told. The highlights in this movie are the light saber duels, Darth Maul, the pod racing, and Obi-Wan-Kenobi.You must watch it if you want to find out the origin of Darth Vader.If you are a Star Wars fan buy it and be a judge for yourself. You will be entertained."
5,The beginning of Star Wars!,"The beginning of Star Wars or so they say! I love sci-fi, I am a Trekie and a Star Wars buff, so naturally I like this stuff. It was nice to see a well put together, different & imaginative movie put together on where it all started."
2,boring,"This movie had everything: hype, stars,amazing special effects, all the crucial elements that hollywood blockbuster should have. Despite all these elements,""phantom menace"" fails to live up to my expectation. Clumsy plot, bad acting, stupid dialogue, I actually fell asleep about half way throughout the movie but couldn't sleep any longer because I paid 9 bucks for it. This movie is drenched with so many special effects, it's boring. Final climactic battle probably the most boring sequence in the entire movie. I think George Lucas should not direct episode 2."
2,"No DVD, no matter. I wouldn't buy this anyway.","After all the reviews on this one, I won't spend much time with it. Here it is: (1)What a waste of Liam Neeson's talent! I know nothing about his character. (2)Darth Maul was pretty worthless as the villain. Other than one incredible fight sequence he did nothing to impress. (3)The pod race that people seem to think is so great is straight out of Ben Hur. (4)That Jar-Jar Binks annoyed me throughout the movie and apparently will be around for the next one. That should keep me away from there! I wouldn't give this one any stars at all if it weren't for the special effects which are very well done. But I don't watch movies for special effects. I watch them for entertainment. And this one mostly just annoys."
2,What happened?,"The Phantom Menace is an OK movie. The special effects were good and the overall story was ok, but where did that GREAT suspenseful story go that was in the original trilogy? In my opinion there were too many special effects that took away from the story. There were more annoying creatures in this movie than in the original trilogy. The drama and the romance that was in The Empire Strikes Back especially is not at all there in episode 1. There was too much focus on the special effects in episode 1 rather than the story."
2,"Hey, George, where's the story?","Question, my young Jedi: why write a review of a block-buster that everybody and their mother has something to say about? Well,'cause like most of 'em, ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore"" (to quote an actual ""good"" movie).Does George Lucas have such little respect for the legions of Star Wars fans that he thinks he can pass off this over-grown commericial for SW toys and merchandise as ""the Real Thing?""Yes, visually it is spectacular-- the computer-generated sequences are amazing. But, after the opening scroll you might as well turn off the sound, 'cause if you came here for anything resembling a well-scripted story, you've come to the wrong place.Bottomline: if a modicum of the care and effort that went into developing the effects and ""look"" of the film had gone into the script and character development, STARS WARS I would have been a worthy addition to the SW canon."
2,if there had been no original trilogy...,"this would have been the first and last star wars movie ever made. horrible acting (anakin, padme, mace, et al) with only a few good performances (obi-wan, palpatine). midi-chlorians? rubbish. the force is weak with this film."
3,What the hell happened here?,"This movie was a big disappointment, and a major letdown from the last three films. Jar Jar Binks wasn't even funny at all, Jake Lloyd sucked as Anakin, and the dialogue was flat. Lucas needs to improve on the story and character development, along with adding more humor. But even with these shortcomings, the movie is still watchable thanks to the amazing special effects. Thankfully Attack of the Clones improves on most of the problems that made this movie such a blow, and I expect Revenge of the Sith to fully return the trilogy to the level of the original movies."
1,great - if your under 10,"Its inconceivable that im giving such a bad rating to a star wars movie, but its all that it deserves.Evrything i loved about the originals, i even loved Revenge of the Jedi, is gone.The little kid is almost as obnoxios as Jar Jar, luckily for him we got distracted by covering our ears in horror whenever Jar Jar was on screen.But my nephew at 4 loved this film, kids seem to love it, anyone with slightly more demanding an appetite tends to feel naseus.This was blatantly concevied as a giant marketing excercise, to see how many games and toys they could tie in to one big product.The fact Ewan Mcgreggor, in interviews said it was the most boring thing hes ever done pretty much sums it up.If only Lucus would forget about making millions from games and marketing and remeber that its a film we were all waiting a long time to enjoy."
1,Why oh why did Lucas make these terrible movies???,The prequels are a sad representation of the Star Wars legacy...
4,a new fan but an old one,"I like the first one because it is the beginning. In human nature when you change something, people don't like it. I liked to meet obi-wan kenobi (ewan Mcgregor) before he became Alec guinness,in episode iv. Did you know what movie made Alec guinness famous? I will tell you THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI which is a war movie. If you haven't seen it please do, rent it or whatever. As i said ealier i am an old and new fan. some people don't like jar jar binks but he is comic relif. I am sorry about my spelling please forgive me. I am looking forward to seeing the movie on dvd that i don't own untill october 16 2001 but my review is basied on the vhs tape, which i have watched many times. Something instrsting obi-wans light saber is blue in episode 1 the same color as it is in episode IV why is that. Enough of me watch the first one and look for things that appear later in episode IV. han solo in episode 1 is born or just about to be or not to be?"
1,What the heck is going on?,"Man, this movie was just confusing. At least the old Star Wars movies were understandable to the regular person. The new one had so much space lingo it was just annoying. Can somebody tell me what a ""Sith"" is? What the heck was that thing that Kwiy-John (or whatever his name is) knocked over? Why doesn't Yoda just die already, or at least get some ""Hooked-On-Phonics?"" I know four year olds that are more understandable. What happened to Liam Neeson? His acting was unusually bad. The sword fights were the best part, and they just weren't that good. Special effects and flashing lights don't make a good movie. Rent this movie with a Trekkie so you can understand what is happening."
1,Menacing Disappointment,"did anyone really expect this to be good? with all the hype leading up to it, it could only be a let down. while the effects were good, everything still looked extremely rendered and cartoonish. the acting was sub par, and the worst part was the kid. YIPEEEEEE! (he shouts that 3 times in the movie). jar jar binks is below mentioning. darth maul... we never learn much about him, and he's not one iota as menacing as darth vader. the saddest part to me is that there are so many devoted star wars fans out there who refuse to see this movie for what it is. they are so blinded by everything lucas and the fact that they waited days/weeks for tickets that they would feel extremely guilty or duped by calling the movie anything but amazing. in reality, it lacks the creativity and vision to put it in the same league as the original trilogy. want good sci-fi? look elsewhere."
3,VHS Brings the Film Down,"The film was great in theaters, but the fact that it isn't on DVD yet automaticaly brings the movie down to just being a good movie. When the DVD comes out my rating will change, especially since Lucas should have enough time to put in as many special features as possible on the DVD, like the music video to ""Dual of Fates"" and the making of Episode I. Hope some of you enjoy the movie just fine on VHS, but for me I rather own the DVD."
4,So the movie wasn't perfect to the aged Star Wars fans...,"So what? This movie was made for the new generation of StarWars fans! Jar Jar Binks was created to bring in little children tothe saga. (Good Job Mr. Lucas, Hook 'em while they are young!) The plot was pretty good I thought. Times change and people need to realize this."
1,This movie is great! (not),"This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I didn`t even bother to see the whole movie, ....! Instead i saw BIG DADDY who was much better! I guess the sound and the movie-effects was good, but that doesn`t make it a good movie, does it? No, if you really want to see this movie, rent it!"
1,The worst movie ever made???,"The fact Natalie Portman was cast for this movie tells you right off the bat, you're in for a complete suck fest. She evern managed to ruin Black Swan....a movie that *could* have been awesome had she not been included. This is the worst movie EVER MADE!"
1,what was george thinking!,totally confusing. amidala has clones and talks like a man. jar jar binks is here to make the kids watch. darth maul a pathetic jedi attempt. anakin is a kid??? wth! i want to see him with a lightsaber not racing cars.
2,"Should have been called ""Muppets in Space""","No, I take it back...that would be an insult to the real ""Muppets in Space"". I have no idea what George Lucas was thinking when he made this movie, but the result is an embarrassment to the Star Wars franchise. At least the DVD version is packed with some decent extras...hopefully the original Star Wars will be released on DVD in a similar package and in the process of putting it together Lucas will be reminded of what made Star Wars so popular in the first place."
2,Really Disappointing Movie,"After seeing the first Star Wars, then the next two installments I must say I was really let down by this movie. Lots of special effects but no clear plot really left me wondering why I even bothered. Plus there were so many things going on, I felt overloaded with information but couldn't figure out what it applied to. This is only for the die hard Star Wars fans."
2,"Disappointing, but still worth owning.","Although this DVD is packed with goodies, looks great, and I am a Star Wars fan, the movie itself is disappointing. If you are expecting the same caliber storytelling from George Lucas as before, you are in for quite a surprise! Jar-Jar Binks is the most annoying character, and some of the storyline is a bit hard to swallow. Yes, one should suspend their beliefs when watching science fiction, but this was too much! The future Lord Vader as a kid yelping ""Whoopie"" was just plain silly! Granted he IS only a kid, but let's face it, the Ewoks were more appealing!!!On the other hand, the sets, costumes, pod race, and Darth Maul make it tolerable and still worth owning. Too bad he had to die off, Darth Maul is one of Lucas' best bad guys! Hopefully the next episode will be better!"
3,Mr. Spielberg knew what he was doing,"Yes, that's what I said. Ol' Steve knew what he was doing by releasing Episode 4 first. Who knew he had such vision? Like most of the other reviewers, I agree that if Episode 1 had been released first, there would have been a low rumble in the universe as Spielberg flopped into a big ol' pile of mud. But, by giving us Episodes 4, 5 and 6 he used the back end of a story to leave us panting for more. And he delivered more. We don't care that the acting is horrid or the plot is wobbly. All we want to see is how Anakin grows up to be Darth Vader.Mr. Spielberg are you related to P.T. Barnum?"
5,George Lucas is the master,"even those of you hate Jar Jar should love this flick, because the more you hate him the happier you will be when Anakin eventually cuts him down!!The Duel of Fates alone makes this a must have :)"
5,A must have for any DVD Collection,"This DVD is a necessity for any true DVD collection. If you thought the special effects and picture was amazing in the theatre, you should see the job Lucas Arts has done on this DVD. The special bonus cd is another huge amazing compulation of deleted material and bonus schematics. If this is just the beginning abilities of DVD creations by Lucas Arts, then waiting for Episodes IV, V, and VI has just officially become unbarable. Trust me when I say that this DVD is probably the best DVD ever to be released."
3,Where's the good old Star Wars,"When i saw this movie at the theaters i was really impressed.I had never before in my life seen such good special effects in a movie before.But there was one thing dough.I had of course seen the old star wars trilogy before and i loved it.I loved it so much that i even used at least 50 dollars on the special edition versions.And when star wars episode 1 came too the theathers i was amazed.Amazed of how George Lucas could make an all time classic trilogy into a movie for childrens(12 years old).And when that happend all the star wars spirit ran away.The three stars i gave to this movie, i gave to the special effects and the few memerable scenes!"
4,Basic Foundation.,Ok folks I have read dozens of reviews both good and bad and I fully understand both points of view. I personally feel it was a very difficult task indeed for Lucas to go back t the very beginning after such a layoff. After making A New Hope I am sure he had no idea how he was going to finish with Return Of The Jedi and then back in time to Episode1. The Phantom Menace could only go so far with it's direction and can only be used as a point of reference. This move did exactly what it was intended to do. It was to be the basic foundation to which the entire series is made. After watching the next two movies I am sure many will find more appreciation for the entire series. My biggest complaint is the exceptionally poor video quality. THX indeed? I have exercise tapes that are of better quality.
4,Top of the line effects,"You know when a movie has awesome special effects when they can't be told from the footage of real performers. THAT's the case of Episode I. Sometimes the scenes have SO MANY DETAILS that they're hard to detail, but that doesn't take anything away to the movie.Lucas has done it again. I wouldn't say this is the best of the four (that's why I'm giving it a 4 of 5), but it definitely is worth being in your collection, specially if you're serious about Star Wars."
3,This movie resembled the agility of a Hutt,"It took too long to get to good sequences, the good sequences didn't last very long, the storytelling took forever, the humor was too spotty, and the best part of the movie..the much anticipated fight scene took less than even the classic Vader v. Kenobi matchup in Episode IV"
1,"No DVD, don't buy it.","A major disappointment for all movie lovers and Star Wars fans. Granted, the movie it self is 3 stars or more, but the VHS tape is not worth buying at all and disgraces the movie even further (having Jar-Jar contribute the most to it's shame). George Lucas, why are you wasting everyone's time with such substandard media? Trying to sell us the VHS tape of SW:PM makes yourself and all of LUCAS INDUSTRIES look like penny pinchers. Money isn't everything, especially when you've got fans that have lasted 20 and more years with you. Sheesh."
4,Kids Love Jar-Jar,"OK, Jar-Jar may be a little irritating to us adults, but as a parent of 5 boys (ages 6 mo. to 11 years), Jar-Jar brings much needed lightness to a fairly dark tale. Just when you think the Jedi are going to die, Jar-Jar shows up and gives the kids some breathing room.I think that this will be as much a classic to my 11 year old, as the original Star Wars Episode IV was to me. I stood in line for 4 hours in 1977 to see it for the first time, and waited 2 hours last year to see it with my boys.My only complaint is the muddiness of the soundtrack with regards to the voices. It was muddy in the theatre, and is muddy at home. You think that Lucas with his THX system would get it right on one of his films. Come on, Skywalker, Use the Force."
1,2001's Worst Video Transfer?,"The only purpose to buy this DVD is to showcase just how poor video quality gets on DVD.This movie was showcased as a beautiful digital video experience in ""Electronic Cinema"" presentations. Utilizing superb digital transfers and high powered experimental video projectors there was an existing digital version of this movie that was superb.Why the consumer version on DVD looks so soft is anyone's guess. Could there be a ""Collectors"" version we will have to buy to see a good quality version?I make my living promoting quality home video. This is not a good example of the potential for picture quality with DVD production capabilities.JS"
1,Only John Woo could be worse,"Aside from movies directed by John Woo this is the worst film I've ever seen. It's not like it's any one thing, either. It just falls so completely short of everything that it could be. Jar-Jar, awful cue-card reading by Jake Lloyd, a terribly over-the-top Darth Maul... I don't harbor any ill-will to anyone over this movie, I just wonder what the hell happened since the first trilogy. Oh well, I've still got the original trilogy, pre-special edition, so that's what I'll keep watching. CGI effects just look too much like a cartoon for me to take anything but PIXAR movies seriously. I wish I liked this movie, I really do, but as it stands I'm not even going to bother watching Episode 2 now. Beside, will missing a ""performance"" by Christopher Lee really be that bad?"
1,Worse than Godzilla,"This is the worst hyped movie I have ever seen. There is none of the Star Wars magic in this film. None of the characters in the film are sympathetic and Jar Jar is the worst creation in the history of film. Buying this movie is like telling George Lucas that it is okay to make a billion dollar movie with an awful script. The worst thing about this movie is that the computer special effects are the real star and there is no humanity or soul in the film. Star Wars was a great movie because it had characters people could relate to, but this movie has none. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS MOVIE."
1,Why? Why? Why?,"The fact that the first three films were a overly simplistic is understandable because Lucas was new to film making and had a limited budget. They had potential but ultimately Lucas didn't expand the Star Wars Universe to satisfy people who want some depth in their movie experience.So what's his excuse now? Rather than grow up with his audience and create a prequel that would stimulate some brain cells he simply created a movie as an excuse to sell more toys. I mean come on, doesn't he have enough money to get some real writers and pay for some special effects that don't look like special effects?When I saw all the Star Wars fans getting so excited over the coming of this movie, (many of them going so far as to actually buy tickets for Meet Joe Black just to see the coming attractions for the Phantom Menace and then walk out) I was almost certain that Lucas wouldn't let them down.At this point if the next two movies are even remotely interesting I'll be very surprised."
5,star wars: episode 1,good movie lots of action and tells the story of the beginning of the whole star wars saga.
5,Pretty good.,"Now, when this movie FIRST came out, I saw it nine times in the theater, owned the graphic novel, owned two Episode 1 novels, and owned the playstation 1 game which i played with my brother 24/7. This was a really good move, but you may not quite get the star wars feeling you desire. Its not quite as good as the original ORIGINAL trilogy, but its up there. I own it now, and on the DVD they add one deleted scene and extended podrace in the movie (plus you can watch them on the special features.) If you havent seen it yet-well, why not? Try it. I loved it. You might, too."
5,"Okay, listen up here","First of all, PLEASE do not pay ANY attention to all those idiots who call themselves critics but aren't able to understand a masterful film such as this. If you cannot feel the Force in this film, it's not because of the film, it's because of you. The entire Star Wars saga is a warm and beautiful story for people who can still open their heart for a wonderful story such as this, and who have no need for postmodernistic cynism and other depressive ways of expression. This film is a unique achievement, a timeless story with some of the greatest characters, music, special effects, atmosphere and simple beauty that the world of storytelling has ever known. Love it, I know I do."
1,I wish this movie had never been made. It's the terrible truth: Star Wars has jumped the shark.,"This was a bad movie. Too much CGI, too much stiff acting, too much ridiculous stuff (Anakin almost accidentally destroying a federation trade ship), many unwelcome revelations about the force (the metachlorides), and featuring THE most annoying character in the star wars universe (yousa know who I mean).Star Wars jumped the shark with this movie and it never truly recovered. Though I liked RoTS and thought AoTC was okay, I could not truly take them seriously like the original trilogy partly because this crappy movie sucked all credibility out of the franchise. This gets my vote for the WORST Star Wars movie ever made."
1,Why bother?,"Why bother to see this movie, when there are so many good Disney pictures around?? This movie goes on the same category as Shrek, Monsters Inc, and Final Fantasy, and is much worse than all those... want to see a big, computer animated movie? go see Shrek... this has nothing to do with Star Wars as we knew it."
2,A let down,"I was a little kid when the first trilogy was released. I always liked those movies. This one I didnt. I tried to. I did. It just wasnt there for me. Maybe it was the way Anikin was played by that Lloyd kid, or the WAY OVERDONE special effects, or the lame jokes and even lamer Jar Jar.(Lucas, what the hell were you thinking with him?) Some characters in movies have been annoying, but NOTHING like that waste of space!! Yousa [bad]Jar Jar!!! Even the saber fight wasnt special. Sure it was fun to watch, but there was no drama to it. They didnt even know who DM was!! I hope part 2 is more interesting with an older Anikin."
2,Abandon all hope...,"If you liked the characters and relatively good story from the first three Star Wars movies, than DO NOT watch this one. The shallow story goes right along with characters of the same. A fun sci-fi style movies with decent action, but a not too good story. Then ther is the real killer Jar Jar Binks. Star Wars albatross. Rent this one."
5,WATTO!,This movie has the first of what will hopefully be many appearances by the greatest acting sensation in the history of the cinema... WATTO! That alone gets the film the highest review possible. Aren't their 6 stars? Watto certainly deserves them.
2,A Star For Each Good Scene,"I gave this movie two stars because there are only two good parts in it. First is the podracing scene which was very exciting and well done. The second good part was the last lightsaber battle which was one of the collest things I've ever watched. The rest of the movie was poorly written, directed, and except for the more vetran actors like Liam Neeson and Ewan McCregor, the acting was pitiful. And I know you've all heard this a million times before but I'll say it again, Jar Jar Binks was one big mistake. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was very entertaining but had no real desire to see it again. Except for the die hard Star Wars fans, I think most people will feel the same way. Rent it once just to know what every one is talking about but don't waste any more money on it."
4,"Good, but not star wars","Ok, people are looking at it the wrong way. The original star wars was an incredible movie, in fact its one of my favorites. That is why Star Wars Edpisode 1 gets a bad reviews. Suppose star wars had never previously existed and this was the first ever star wars movie to be produced. People would actually find it to be a very unique genre of movie. Its sort of a scifi/fantasy movie. People would like it. In conclusion i will say that Star Wars Episode 1 is not starwars, it doesn't deliver ""the star wars feel"" like the other origonal movies did. Hopefully the other 2 movies will be better."
1,Don't waste your money. The VHS version is LOW quality.,"George Lucas -You won't release Episode 1 on DVD. Why not? You are dictating to millions of people your preference of them watching Star Wars: The Phantom Menace on VHS. The VHS quality is very poor, compared to DVD. I purchased the widescreen version, expecting a much higher quality of recording on the videocassette. It is of such low quality (and the sound is severely limited by VHS - no 5.1 on a videocassette. The best you'll hope for is Pro Logic) that I am ashamed to play it for people. My home theater system is of the quality that it makes this low quality piece of trash show how low quality it is.Don't waste your time."
5,release date please! ...(phantom menace on DVD ?....),Any word yet if this movie will be on DVD? Is this another hype thing just like E.T.? star wars fans are getting frustrated! cut them a break!
1,What the hell is that!,Im sorry but I really think that is the flop of the year. It's just a parade of visuals effects and we don't even see the actors. The first trilogy with Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill was terrific and I really think that George Lucas should stop this mess immediately.
1,"Wow, talk about a bad actting, writting, and directing","Wow, I was hoping that it would be a good movie, but I now know, that you can't expect a good movie, from a cheap billionare who cuts corners every chance he gets. Like he dosn't have enough money. Some of the worst actting I have ever seen, and the visual effects weren't great either. You would think with all the money he has, he would spent it to make a great movie, but I guess I was wrong."
2,Good movie -- Horrible on VHS though,"I still have the original Star Wars when it was first released on video. It has been watched, literally, over 70 times. The picture quality of this 20-year-old pre-THX video, looks better than this $29.95 brand new video. I have to back up the other reviews about how bad the transfer was to VHS. It looked like a bootleg in most parts of the movie. It is stamped with the THX logo, but you sure wouldn't know it by watching it. Oh well, maybe Lucas will improve it on The Phantom Menace Special Edition VHS in 2021."
2,The Phantom Disappointment,"Do NOT waste your money on this video! The video quality is terrible! The picture did not seem to be up to usual VHS standards, and was so far beneath DVD standards as to be laughable. The only redeeming virtue of this tape was the sound quality, which was surprisingly good considering it was not digital. The best sound effects in the universe could not make up for the grainy, blurred picture. I love this movie despite its faults, but I wish I had held out for the DVD, however many years that takes! Wait for Lucas to come out of his cave and realize that DVD is the only way to view his movies! Save your money!"
1,JUNK - A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!,"All in all a great shame. I think LUCAS musta flipped and I say this as a MAJOR fan of the ""Holy Trilogy""... To quote Stone and Parker the creators of South Park from their Playboy interview - an ""atrocity""... The depth of the earlier films only makes this one feel even worse! No development of character, fights without reason or logic. You know when you come down to it - the actors looked pretty bored. And after everything and I mean everything, it all came down to unfair TAXES? I just cannot believe the whole thing looked like it did and I am truly sad for the whole catastrophe. I hope the next one is better..."
2,SIGH,"After seeing the original series I hated Episode I the first time around. The special effects were wonderful and so were the sets and many*** of the creatures who inhabited this world. But the characterizations were dull and the acting was wooden. The plot was darn near incomprehensible.But when I saw Episode I for the second time, on PPV, I noticed the music and sound effects were overwhelming the dialogue, so I turned on closed-captioning and voila! I could understand both dialogue and plot. Unfortunately the newly decipherable story was pretty lame - way too 'talky' and far too long. I think Lucas could have cut this by 30 minutes without hurting it a bit, but then where would he have had a place to hang all the effects and new species?***[Except for Jar-Jar Binks, who drove me nuts with that phony-Caribbean lingo and other affectations that would have been racist if this had been a human creature]"
2,The Phantom Garbage,"I can't believe I actually paid money to see this in the theaters. Horrible acting, terribly annoying characters and a super digital feel. Nothing about this movie is worth the money you'll spend. Save your money for something more worthy like a bad haircut."
3,gee...do I really wanna weigh in on this one?,"Let's cut to the quick...if you work hard for a living and at the end of the day you just wanna pop a burrito in the oven, grab a beer and put a special effects space flick on the tube so you can veg for a couple of hours, here's your flick. However, if you're looking for the original brilliance of Lucas...sorry. If you're looking for solid character development...no cigar. If it will break your heart to see the talent of Liam Neeson wasted...stay away. If you're turned off by the ""Joseph Campbell-the-universe-is-a-great-big-myth-good vs.evil-mystical hodge podge""...run for your life. If you are offended by thinly veiled racial stereotyping...flee. But, if you need something to go with that burrito and beer...enjoy."
4,Mytic Adventure!,"Nostalgic of the old classic of his day(like Flashgordon)or(Sinbad and the Pirates)George Lucas has captured us once again,with his wonderous space opera in a galaxy long ago.In this 1st Chapter,Jedi master Qui Gon Jin(Liam Neeson)and his young student Obi Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGegor) try to negotiate peace but find themselves in the midst of war instead,while attempting to protect a young Queen and save a planet from invasion.On their Journey to find help and support in the Galactic Senate,the Jedi's find themsevles stranded on a mysterious far away planet where they incounter a young boy with a special power and a dark unknown destiny that is greater than can imagine.Well made and exciting,this first Chapter of the George Lucas Space Fantasy is a fine first introduction and shawdow of things to come in the series .Absolutly astonishing special effects,a must have for your movie libary."
4,Good,"this is a good movie. I think it would of made audiences think it was better if there wasn't so much hype for the movie. But like ""NEW HOPE"" this movie is so setting you up for Episode 2 and 3. I do suggest watching this one if you want to watch the others."
2,Only The Die Hard Fans will Appreciate,"I gave this movie two stars for the beautiful special effects in the movie. I saw it twice, being a huge Star Wars fan but just could not enjoy this movie. Awkward plot line(what are they doing anyway! )annoying characters(jar jar)and dead pan acting really disappointed me. Darth Maul was fascinating but again he only had five lines in the movie! Die Hard fans of course will say this is the best Star Wars ever, but I have to disagree..."
3,George Lucas has lost his touch...,"With the release of Episode I, a new and old generation of Star Wars ""buffs"" gathered...the reactions were very mixed. The biggest of the flaws to this movie was the fact that Lucas had diverted from an audience of older, more mature thinkers of the original trilogy, to a more child-like movie for the younger viewers (especially the dreaded Jar Jar Binks)...the actors and actresses in this movie did not do as well as the such-which for the trilogy. The way that Jake Lloyd acted out this movie is in comparison to the way that most children would act out movies in the early 1940s...also the movie was made to be more ""Americanized"" than a real distant, and unknown culture. Yes, Lucas has lost his dark, spiritual, and intellectual touch..."
2,"Get a New Storyline, George!","So where have we seen this before? A journey to another planet, a desperate battle on the planet surface that can only be won when a good guy does the impossible in a fighter high above the planet. Good guys win. The end.Three out of four Star Wars movie have had this same basic plot - only Empire was different.Excellent visual effects. Flat acting from all but Liam Neeson.Hey, George! Get a new storyline! The old one is worn out and special effects can't save it anymore."
3,A little too childish,"This wasn't the disaster that some are claiming, but it's certainly a disappointment. My main problems were (of course) Jar Jar, and the so-called biological description of The Force. Lucas has dug himself a hole on explaining that one. Oh, and Anakin's blind destruction of the space station near the end was just plain stupid.Actually, the plot itself wasn't bad, since it does tie in to the rest of the ""story"". But the lack of any substantial character development was a major weakness. All will be forgiven if Episode II is better, which means it must have some of the characters actually feeling something.I want Episode II and III to be made for those of us in our late 20s and 30s who grew up with Star Wars. If Lucas wants to make movies for the ten year olds, he should start a new saga (Jar Wars perhaps?)"
2,Let down By Money,"This film is just not as good as it could have been indeed SHOULD have been. The Reson:LUCAS should not have directed, Apart from the wonderfull light saber duel it was stale and slow.Let Tim Burton do episode 2!"
1,Skip It,If your under 12 you may like the movie. If your an avid Star Wars fan you will cry! It is a sad movie I mean sad from begining to end. I am such a big fan of StarWars I can quote complete dialogue from the first trilogy. I have read all the books even the ones for episodes 7/8/9 by Timothy Zaun but could not make any real connections between the trilogy and this episode.
2,The Phantom Menace was George Lucas,"I only saw this movie once and that was when it first came out in the theaters.This movie was bad.i agree with the real reviews on this movie.Bad story , bad acting , and boy was little Annie terrible . I still to this day want my money back from seeing this train wreck. The only thing that saved the prequels was Revenge of the Sith. Other than that , the last 3 episodes should always be the films Star Wars fans should collect."
3,it finally got here,"I had orderd this for my son to view while I was out of town, as a gift. I ordered it over a week before I left, yet it got here about 3 weeks after I returned. It did finally get here by the window they said, however not fast enough for me.Movie was ok."
1,Very Bad,Very bad Sci-Fi. Take away the special effects (which were done in the 70's) and this would have been a B-rated movie playing at 1:00 am on cable. In the first Star Wars Lucas introduced a universe with great potential. Since the Ewoks it has been nothing but a marketing plot.(Do I need to bring up Jar Jar Binks?) In the next film perhaps Lucas will start making good Sci-Fi again.
2,OH NO! GEORGE-WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!,"I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I just don't understand how anybody, especially Star Wars fans, can watch this film and not feel disappointed and cheated. What a bad movie! Besides the exciting pod race scene, Liam Neeson as Qui-Gonn Jinn and the all-too-short jedi battle at the film's ending(isn't it very un-Jedi-like to tag up on an opponent?), 'Menace' is boring, hokey and extremely frustrating to watch. And I am praying to every single saint that I can think of that Lucas DOES NOT tackle the roles of screenwriter and director for the next two films. Maybe hand those chores over to the likes of Lawrence Kasden(screenwriter of 'Empire')to write it or Frank Darabont to direct. Maybe this way, we won't have to watch ANOTHER big space battle finale or ANOTHER villain falling down a bottomless chasm, and we'll get something done with a little bit more style and originality instead of self-repetition and uninspired storytelling."
4,It doesn't live up to the hype...,"Now, I love the Star Wars films... although this might not be as good as the *other* movies... this still is George Lucus' masterpiece! And 'heck', it's the first Star Wars film on DVD! Look at all those bonus features! It'll be a blast. I thought the movie was *good* but not great. It can be entertaining... just not as entertaining as the first 3. The special effects are totally stunning. (Just look at the pod-race scene, holy...!) It may not be as classical as the movies before it, but 'heck', it's Star Wars and I'm pretty 'darn' happy. Get this disc, it's a work of magic (the special effects that is..) the actual movie is O.K. it's not TOTALLY AWESOME, but it'll do until a new one comes out."
2,All that waiting for this,"What can I say? Lucas falls flat. Sure the film looks beautiful but it has no magic like the first three. Gone is the shoot em up space cowboy thriller of before and replaced with a kids movie with adorable Jar Jar Binks. The enemies are droids so with the exception of Darth Maul there are no real fatalities in this film. What happened to legions of Storm Troopers and planets being destroyed. Instead, we have a cream puff movie where the end is all happy and laughs and no one is left no laughing. This would have been great as a Scooby Doo episode!"
2,Waste of money,"OK --- let's see how many 'Star Wars' fans I can upset here. I thought the whole thing was a waste of effort, time and money. I enjoyed the original 'Star Wars' - it was fun to watch, good entertainment. But this was just dire. The lead actors (McGregor, Neeson et al) were completely wasted in a script as flat as cardboard. The SFX were impressive at times, but even that failed to save a film that I would consider a chore to rewatch. There is nothing of the liveliness and gung-ho sense of adventure of the original. The whole thing is lacking in excitement and good humour. Spend your hard-earned dollars on something else."
1,Insomnia Cure,"This ranks alongside ""Not of this Earth"" and ""Hercules"" starring Ferrigno as one of the WORST wastes of celluloid on the planet.No character development,STUPID comic relief,and 99% CGI.Basically-it's a Star Wars screensaver for your tv.I've tried 15 times to watch this disaster-and with a gallon of coffee and 5 liters of Mountain Dew-can't stay awake.Keep in mind,I saw the original trilogy over 100 times and adore it-this...was a toy commercial.Quoting Randall from animated 'Clerks'-""Get Lucas out of my sight!"""
2,"Yes, I'm reviewing a movie which is over ten years old but I still haven't forgiven George Lucas!",What can be said about the movie at this point? The final lightsaber duel is the only thing worth watching. Biggest cinematic blunder of all time. And the sequals didn't did get any better. Killed my love affair with Star Wars.
1,what a shame,"man, what a letdown, a truly terrible movie, it seemed to cater to little kids. someone tell george lucas that with a computer you can type up a good story as well as make all these crazy worlds and flying things. jar jar was a terrible idea, the whole thing was and is a complete disaster!!!!"
3,Something was missing...,"The movie was okay, but there seemed to be something missing in the plot. I don't really know what it is, but you could really tell that something was missing. I think that a little bit of CGI is fine, but this was completely overdone. There was also a plot hole. Obi wan said that Yoda was his instructer in ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but in this film, he said that Qui-Gon was his instructor...that could really throw people off. Otherwise this story was okay, but there seemed to be no real main idea in this movie. 3 stars out of 5"
4,A Great Beginning,"I have always enjoyed the Star Wars universe, and The Phantom Menace is no exception. Awesome graphics! Familiar characters! And new ones to boot! The pod racing could inspire whole new videogames.I eagerly await the rest of the sequel, but I had to give this movie 4 stars because I want it on DVD, one of the best formats in existence today. I would love to see all of the Star Wars films on this medium. George Lucas, please show us DVD owners some support."
3,Buy for the lightsaber fight,"because the story is pathetic. It starts off good--it could have made for a great movie. However, the characters were about a centimeter deep and there was no emotional response at all, except for disgust-mine. Well, alot of people think the FX are great, but I disagree. It looks fake. The saber fights and the music are wonderful though. Buy it for these."
1,Star Wars 1: The CG Menace,"This is a review of Star Wars 1: The Computer Animated Menace. The computer graphics used in this film looked really phony, and I think the special effects from the old Star Wars films are far better. Not only that the acting and script writing was a lot better back then. The big pod race scene looked like an effort to plug his pod race video game. Not only that what about Jar Jar Binx? Lucas stop trying to be cute and use the force for Petes sake!"
2,Sad movie sequel - Excellent DVD,"As a lot of people already said, it's a great DVD but a bad movie.As a Star Wars fan it was very sad for me to see the myth broken in pieces.The special effects are great, the customs are beautiful and... there nothing more.It was like looking a special effects presentation with poor dialogs, actors and a long so on. The worse of course, was Jar Jar Binks and all it's tribes... simply annoying, stupid and disturbing. The pod racer has great effects but i felt on a children movie with the two head creature narrator making jokes all the time, Java getting sleep and all sort of silly jokes.Don't know what Lucas had in mind, but the history was the last anyway; is like the ending of the Return of the Jedi, too much idiot creatures (the ewoks) doing silly jokes and less smart and interesting dialogs. As much as i love the first 3 movies i hate this one. Sad to say but true."
3,Mitichloreans?,"Well well well. George Lucas destroyed the magic of the Force in this Star Wars movie by mentioning mitechloreans. However, he made the movie a high-special effects hype that was pretty popular.Here's another problem. With all the canon information, we know that all Jedi disappear after they die! Why not Qui-Gon?I also find it a crime that there is no DVD version of this out yet. However, if you want good stories, go out to your bookstore and at least buy the Star Wars Thrawn trilogy by Timothy Zahn."
2,"Looks like Disney ""done it""","Well like others who miss the orignal star wars I can finally pronounce this one DOV (dead on viewing) it seems like Disney got hold of this one and made it ""cuter"" sure it trys to appeal to everyone cute aliens,mystical message and all that but nothing about this could really hold my attention. George Lucas should follow the yellow brick road not try to recreate it."
5,Amazing!,"As the famous orange-yellow words flew up the screen, I knew this was going to be good. In this movie, Amazing Special-Effects plus Amazing Sound and a nice plot combine to recreate the experience we all had in the 1970's. This movie is George Lucas's definitive vision of Star Wars."
3,Average for Star Wars standards.,"I would have to say that this is not Lucas's best film ever produced. The voice overs in the movie are very cheesy, sounds like something from a 50's film. Overall visual special effects are great as always. The plot line seems a bit hard to grasp at first, but overall easy to understand. Jar Jar binks as im sure you might have heard is a bit annoying, but does however add a little humor to the movie, definitely a chick charactor (no offense).I am definitely looking forward to Episode II and I hope Lucas puts a bit more of the ""Star Wars"" feeling back into it."
2,It sucked,too many effects and not enough work on the actual story...maybe its just a kids movie but for true fans i hope the next two get a lot better
3,Overated and Over-hyped in advertising - still an okay movie,"After viewing the movie in the Theatre, and yes I will purchase on VHS to complete my Star Wars Video Collection, I must say the movie was overated and over-hyped in the media for advertising, etc. It can never take the place of the thrill and excitement of the ""original"" Star Wars nor did it come close. There were good fight scenes and good effects but I felt disconnected from the characters. I'm sure you will enjoy this movie as a good average SCI-FI movie but it's not on the same level as the original Star Wars - so don't get your hopes up."
2,average,"This has to be the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. The plot is nearly non-existent, and the character development is even worse (for instance, Darth Maul is a central character, but there is no explanation of who he is; rather, he just shows up every once in a while for a fight scene or to simply look mean, imposing, and powerful).I prefer streetbrawls.com that has the real action. The effects are great, but in the absence of a storyline they become almost annoying. If it weren't for the fact that this is a Star Wars movie (which gave me hope that it would get better), I would have walked out of the theater after the first 30 minutes"
4,It grew on me.,"I have to admit that the first time I saw Phantom Menace, I hated it. Jar-Jar was irritating, and young Anakin was sickeningly sweet. It definately was not the Star Wars that I remembered from my childhood without Luke, Leia, and Han (who I still think is a very nice looking man).I've gotten to where I like Phantom Menace. It no longer irritates me to the point of exasperation, and Jar-Jar has actually grown on me. I think that it sets the stage well for the next two episodes and I am looking forward to seeing Attack of the Clowns..oops, Clones...when it hits the theatres this spring. I still miss the old cast, but it'll be interesting to see how the characters are developed."
5,The chosen one ?,"Well its much the same story as Godfather III , good movie considering hollywood doesnt make any good movies for years now,but Bad compared to the rest.The effects are excellent, and its more like an experience not tears and drama or interest.this movie is purely philosophical one, if some of the die hard star wars fans didnt get it by now, They must look at the big picture. yes Darth Vader wasnt bad after all, and the Idea is for mankind, that Satan could be in each and every one of us.The movie has very deep messages and call it a 5 year olds ? you all have to watch this movie again and check your heads.peace and love."
2,"Sorry guys, but this one is right down there with the Mummy","I didn't like Star Wars before this movie. I wanted to broaden my horizons and watch one. It was soooo stupid and boring. It was all digital tech and no actor/actress power. You didn't feel anything for the characters. Infact, I remember Jar Jar jumping into the water and I was hoping he was going to drown. I woke up asking who kicked Darth Maul's butt. People, if you want people to like the Star Wars movies, make sure they don't see this one."
3,lack of strong characters,"A big part of the success of the previous three episodes was the strong cast of characters which is a crucial thing for any movie regardless of the plot. What the new episode lacks big time are strong characters with their individual idiosyncrasies. When you ask the question ""what are the characters in Phantom Menace like?"", the answer would not go beyond ""kids and two text book Jedi knights"". The inclusion of a strong female character would have added a lot to the movie. One cannot help wishing Natalie Portman matures fast enough for the remaining episodes..."
3,Wipe them out... all of them!,"I couldn't have anticipated The Phantom Menace more - I waslooking for gossip and rumours for months before Episode I wasreleased at the cinema. Was it worth it? Yes and no. Some of the effects in TPM are awesome - the Podracing scene, the climactic lightsaber duel, the Naboo battle scenes - and there are some classic Star Wars moments (Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon emerging with their lightsabers through a veil of smoke; the Jedi Council scenes on Coruscant). Plus there are some great new vehicles, cities and alien species. The downside of The Phantom Menace is the lack of any characters as good as Han, Luke or *Old* Ben from the original trilogy. Good characters are essential for a good film, and here we just get Jar-Jar instead. Darth Maul is promising, but he's woefully underused and only has two lines of dialogue. But it's a gripping yarn, and it leaves you thirsting for more - so roll on Episode II!"
3,Trilogy was soooo much better...,"After having seen the original Star Wars trilogy an uncountable number of times, I have to say this one did not meet my expectations. I think that George Lucas focused way more on the effects than the storyline and characters, and perhaps if the effects were toned down some it would be a little better. I'm glad to have the history of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader, but it just wasn't done very well. Jar-jar should be deleted, as well as Anakin, who, I'm sorry to break it to all his fans, will turn evil and die. There were a couple of scenes where I was actually rooting for the evil droids because Anakin was so incredibly annoying. If you like sci-fi crammed with effects, you'll like this. But if you're like me and would rather have character and storyline development, and you're a big fan of the trilogy, you probably won't think too highly of this movie."
1,THE worst.,"Lucas has defended this film (and subsequent movies) by saying ""It's for kids."" This is not only the weakest cop-out I've ever heard, but makes it plainly obvious Lucas has no idea who his audience is. The man went from being a Francis Copolla to a Michael Bay. It's sad and depressing."
1,Bad on all levels,This movie is bad on all levels.Acting - DCasting - DDialog - EStory - ECharacters - ECG - E (Computer graphics are great when you can't tell that it is CG)
3,"Good, But Doesn't Have The Magic Of The Original Films","The original films were mostly remembered for their great special effects (for their point in time) and cheesy acting. This newer version, while having great special effects, is extremely long. This 1999 blockbluster, i think, was only successful because of its name and the reputation the Star Wars series has. This movies acting is way too good for the Star Wars series and doesn't have the great comedy like the older movies. Overall, not bad, but not very good aswell."
1,BAD BOX QUALITY,"Today my Star Wars DVD broken at midlle just when i put my DVD back on casethe material used in the the middle of the box it's too Hard.i have very caution with my DVD's almost 100and i never had a trouble like this before.if you wanna buy it go ahead, but don't forget to change the box"
2,Nearly killed Starwars,"How can the same person behind episode 2 be behind this crud. I hate Jar Jar, Amidala sounds ridiculous, I hate the Japanese stereotype aliens, the pod race was boring, everything was overexplained to the point of being like running commentary, way too much cgi. This movie is irrlevant, epecially after seeing episode 2. I remember seeing this in the theater, everyone was all into it until Jar Jar showed up, then he never left, then nobody cared anymore except for the very few scenes with Darth Maul. I never will understand that, I mean the overabundance of Jar Jar , in the documentary Lucas says the number of scenes he's in which i had to laugh at, something like 461!"
1,Better left unreleased,"This is, simply put, not a good movie. George Lucas used Kurosawa's ""hidden fortress"" as inspiration for the original Star Wars... why did he not search the volumes of film/foreign film classics for inspiration of this film? I would say that almost every movie I saw in the last year was better than this-- and I did not have very high expectations for this movie (I didn't see it until it was in the dollar theater.. after all of the bad reviews)rather, this movie comes off as kind of like Star Trek... with the mysterious Force being explained pseudo-scientifically.... I guess a little kid might be amused by this film but I didn't like this movie at all.. and it would be shameful to even mention this dog excrement in the same sentence as modern movies."
2,Oh well... better luck next time,"Well... unfortunately the much hyped ""Episode I"" did not live up to my expectations. I was expecting some amazing sci-fi action, and the classic good storytelling of George Lucas. Instead, Episode I is a mass marketed exploited fest of fake digital effects and weak storyline. In short... the story was no longer written to be a good story, but it was written to be a money making film (A lot of money).Hopefully Episode II will be better."
2,ME sa ja ja binks..... d oh!,"THis movie was written for 12 years olds, and comes off as a poor successor to the ultimate sci fi classic.IN one sum up sentance, me sa ja ja binks, me sa lamo character so little kiddie enjoya moviea.Me no belonga in real sci fi movie. Me no betta be in next one!"
5,Wonderful!,"The Phantom Menace is a wonderful movie, I reccomend it wholeheartedly. The Boxed Set is especially fun, for me at least, you get a small strip of film and a little art book (enthralling for artists!) not to mention better quality movie. My only note is to -please- make sure you've watched the original trilogy... One of my friends that had only watched the Phantom Menace gave me such a startled look when I broke the news that little Anikin grows up to be Darth Vader!"
1,george lucas is a ONE TRICK PONY,"The VHS is OKAY (saw it on the monitor at my local video store). It suffers the usual drawbacks of a VHS tape (occasional video signal distortions etc.) I refuse to purchase this video because by doing so it just prolongs the DVD release of the Phantom Menace and for that matter the original trilogy. George... how much money can you possibly make for a single film? Star Wars (on video), Star Wars Wide Screen Edition, Star Wars (on Laser disc), Star Wars the special edition, ALL the sequels and in all formats. Plus you WILL I'm sure release eventually Star Wars on DVD as a tv format release, wide screen release, special edition (tv format) special edition wide screen etc. etc. etc. Give us a break. Thought of making another film OTHER than Star Wars? On second thought...don't."
1,A Feature Length Toy Commercial,"I was so hoping to love this movie. I plugged my ears and shut my eyes to the critic's reviews -only to find that they were right. None of the characters grew at all in the picture. Not one of them seemed to care about anything. They were flat and basically one-note characters. Only the future Emperor had a glimmer of life to him. The others had less enthusiasm than you see in your average fast-food employee.If you like SciFi, buy ""The Matrix"" or ""Galaxy Quest"". Give this one a pass."
2,Star Wars episode 1,Yes the special effects were outstanding...but I found the characters lacking heart and passion. Obi was the one bright light and Anakin was believable....but I remeber when Darth Vader came on screen you were afraid very afraid not so with this Darth Maul. Great fight scenes wonderful cities the graphics georgeous. But overall I was disappointed it moved too quickly and delivery of some of the dialog was like being read from a script.
1,What a waste of money,"Hmm..ok. I sit in complete disappointment at the moment. The sound quality and picture quality of VHS are a complete disgrace. I might have enjoyed the movie if it wasn't for a blurry VHS picture. Lucas, you are a disgrace to your fans. The movie itself is ok, but VHS makes it look worse you greedy person. For all we know, DVD will probably be outdated by 2005. Thanks for persecuting the people who pay your bills George."
3,"Good, but a little too accidental","The movie was good but the Jake Lloyd's act annoyed me, I would rather have seen somebody else in his part. In the end everything happened by coincidence and I did not like that. Ian McDiarmid's and Natalie Portman's act were excellent but Jar-Jar was not nearly as good as C-3PO was in the first movies, and I kind of a missed Darth Vader"
3,Too much foreshadowing,"After watching this video, I realized that the whole time they were just setting up conflicts to be resolved in the sequels. When I first saw Star Wars: A New Hope, I had no idea that they were going to make more, and I don't think George Lucas did either. All throughout Episode I, they caused all these problems with the young boy, the return of the Sith, and the election of Senator Palpatine, but none of these were resolved. I would have liked to see a little more substance to a movie than just foreshadowing."
3,I wanted to like it more,"I have been a fan of George Lucas and Star Wars Episodes 4-6.The production quality is fantastic as expected but the story did leave me disappointed. It looked like they were trying for special effects more than character development, so lacked much of the charm and humanity that I came to enjoy in the ""original"" episodes.(I would have been happy if they cut some time out of that way-too-long pod race scene and had the characters talk to each other more. If you check out the supplementary material, you see that there was even MORE of the pod race that had been cut out!)"
3,Wasn't happy with the sound,"This is about the DVD only not the movie. The picture quality was terrific on the Home Theater System and the DVD special features are great. I was very disappointed with the sound. I expected a lot more for a THX movie. The explosions and other action scenes sounded dampened and not crisp and clear. Certainly did not have my speakers rocking like Independence Day does. I purchased this with Lord of the Rings (which has outstanding sound) and after comparing the two, Star Wars let me down ."
2,Could've been a lot better than this,"I didn't really like the first ""Star-Wars"" trilogy, however, this movie is lowering bad-taste to new depthes. The plot is silly and the jokes insult the intelligence. The 2 adult main actors are too good for this movie, and their talent is wasted in the general lousiness. The kid can be a good actor, he have potential, but right now he is just a cute-face.However, the special effects are amazing, and the lightsavors are as cool as always. 2 stars and a salut for the special-effects makers."
1,The worst film ever made?,"This movie is so laughingly bad, it left me speechless. The writing is amateurish, the dialogue gibberish, the sets looked like they were from a Roger Corman film, the plot horrible. My God, what happened? This looks like George Lucas 12 year nephew made it. It's AWFUL."
5,Great Addition to SW Saga... Detracters don't have a clue.,"In general, all of the flash in the pan critcs were clueless in their reviews (see good reviews by Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert who are just about the only critics with any validity these days).People who complain about SWE1 are INTENTIALLY LOOKING for stuff to complain about just because they think its the cool thing to do, not event trying to like the movie.SWE1 is not the best in the series (that distinction goes to Empire) but it right on par with the rest of the series. (Remember, there are still 2 more chapters before the story is complete). Even if you ignore the others, this is a spectacular film. (I saw it 6 times in the theatre and did not grow tired of it)Just sit back and enjoy because you are in for a hell of a ride."
5,This is exactly what it's supposed to be...A child's fable,"I was absolutely mesmerized the first time I saw Star Wars: A New Hope. The same thing happened over two decades later with Episode I. This movie was incredible, the special effects made me feel like I had a part in this film. Everyone needs to understand that this is a child's fairy tale set in a sci-fi universe. It sets the stage for the next two films.Jar-Jar was placed in the movie for comic relief, not for a stoic performance of 'MACBETH'. Jar-Jar is a sutle story about someone not so strong or intellegent or good-looking that can still make a difference."
3,Distracted,"I did not see this movie until I bought the video. I'm sure it was much more impressive on the 'big' screen. My greatest complaint is that the mostly unintelligible dialogue, as mouthed by Jar Jar and the Ganguns(?), diverted my attention from the movie as I tried to translate/make sense of what had been said. Overall, I think that the movie was entertaining but was too strongly aimed toward a younger (juvenile) audience, hence the PG rating. Guess I wanted a little more than that."
2,Pretty Awful,"I gave this one 2 stars because my 2-year-old nephew likes it a lot. I think he'll consider it too immature for him by the time he turns 3. The comic-relief buffoon Jar Jar Binks is so annoying, he completely overrides whatever is good about this overlong, very boring film. Unfortunately, if you are a Star Wars fan, it's pretty hard to avoid this movie and just jump straight ahead to the next episode. I recommend borrowing a copy from a friend or renting the cheapest video or DVD you can find. And don't bother with the bonus material unless you really liked the movie."
1,Plleeeassee,"This film totally ruined the original 3 movies for me. At this point, I recommend reading the DUNE series by Frank Herbert, the original idea behind STAR WARS. A lot more complex and cerebral but I'm sure all those STAR WARS fans can handle a little thought. Right."
2,Jar Jar Binks:Nails down a chalk board.,"Take the best special effects ever, perfect movie audience, almost unlimited budget (plus decades in the making) and what do you get? Well, in this case you get a movie that narrated by a slimy creature that wouldn't even make lizard status and has the voice of nails down a chalkboard combined with the worst computer elevator music mankind has ever invented. OK, the queen had potential, but she's supposed to be two years apart from that seven year old and they're going to be getting married? I don't think so! The plot is non-existent, the acting pitiful and really the whole thing is just set up for the next movie. There are no strong actors and no human actors period of note. Hans Solo, Luke, Darth Vadar...we get the point, were what made first movie and you'll be sorely let down if that's what you watch this for. There's no way to connect to this movie and with so many other good movies coming out right now, get something else."
3,Nice DVD but I was expecting more...,"After so long to have this DVD launched, I do admit I was overexcited about its features. It is just an ordinary DVD with some features that any other movie would come with.It is only worth it for the movie, not for the extras."
2,Nowhere near the Original or the Sequels,"This prequel has more effects, a louder score, and the advantage of pre-release hype. That is all that it has going for it. The only character worth developing was Darth Maul whose limited screen time made me pine for more. The young and future Darth Vader was totally bland, not helped by the limited skills of the actor portraying him. Also, I can't get worked up over battle scenes wherein everything on the screen was computer-generated. Give me a guy in a rubber suit anyday."
1,TOO MUCH,This movie contained too much CGI. I prefer the old Star Wars in which they used puppets and toys.
2,"MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, UM . . .","Make that May the Force be with you if you have a bunch of them microscopic Yodas hopping about in your blood. METACHLORIANS! UGGH! And don't get me started on the fart jokes . . . Still, I'd buy this in a second for the pod race and Darth Maul and the future cityscapes."
2,"But for the special features, Just Plain Bad","This movie had one moment that I loved: the lightsaber duel... which is why this rates more than one star.I was mightily dissapointed with this movie, and I could go on and on about contrived plots and love stories, purile dialogue, and gungans who could insult the intelligence of a horsefly... but I wont.The DVD in itself was very well made, worthy of the LucasArts logo.But (and maybe I was expecting too much), I found the movie uninteresting, the stakes not high enough, and I didnt care if any character lived or died."
4,Struggle for preservation,"A good movie about the struggle of the Queen of Naboo (Natalie Portman) to maintain the freedom and way of life of her people, against the scheming Trade Federation.Reminds me of the struggle of the State of Israel, and it's courageous people, to survive against the machinations of the United Nations, European Union, Non Aligned Movement, International Media, World academia etc.Portman is lovely and vivacious, with an unforgettable smile.Queen Anakin refuses to abandon her people in their hour of need and stands against the powerful forces rather than yield. The two Jedi knights,played by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, aided by the and of then the over the top Jar Jar Binks (something between a dinosaur and a hippie) battle the forces of evil , .But aside from Portman 's Queen Amadala, the other unforgettable character is the small boy Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) , apparently the future Darth Vader."
2,This film is a disgrace to Star Wars......,"The Phantom Menace has to be the most boring Star Wars film I've ever seen.Nute Gunray and their droids were pretty stupid. And if this was supposed to be a kid's film, why do they bore us with all the political details?The original trilogy was amazing. They talked about politics, yes, but keeping up with it was fun. Not so with Tpm.Not to mention, the acting was pretty bad. Natalie Portman's character was so stiff and two-demensional that I thought she might be a droid. You just want to scream at her ,""Lighten up! This is Star Wars- have fun with it!""Other than that, well....it wasn't that bad. People keep criticizing Jake Lloyd's acting ability, but he can't be older than ten or so. I thought he did a pretty good job.The podracing scene was the best part. Can't see the point in bringing back Jabba the Hutt, though.I'll give this film a 2/5. Watch for the much-improved Attack of the Clones and the as yet untitled Episode 3."
2,"Quite Bad, actually...","Star Wars fans waited 16 years for this film, but unfortunately it was not worth the wait. The old Star Wars films were by no means masterpieces of modern cinema, but they were still fairly good and very entertaining. This film, however, is just plain bad. The story is boring and the characters are for the most part weak and one-dimensional (I'll not even begin to discuss Jar Jar Binks). Furthermore, the script is perhaps one of the worst ever written for a major blockbuster. It has been said that the purpose of this film was to set up episodes 2 & 3, but that does not justify making something this poor."
4,A visual experience..........Flash Gordon+50..and beyond,"Is Episode I a good movie, you ask.....you bet....is it a great movie,..actually...yes it is....While it might have its quiks...Ep. I is exciting and entertaining with great scence and great characters...and a whole lot of science fiction fun too,and anyone who can take 30's space fantasy and adventure theater,..japanese movies, cowboys and westerns,...biblical and messianic undertones and mix it with egptian prophetcy and fairy tails deserves a lot of credit and all the awards he can get....The DVD is spectacular,a world-class first -rate production...showing once again that OL' Georgie leaves 'em all in the dust...so go out and get it today..."
2,Lucas should leave screenwriting to someone else,"The visual of this movie is so meticulously constructed the it made me twice as sad to see the story and screenwriting skill is only third graded. Where is the tension in plot? Do we care about the characters and what is happening? I remember watching the underwater scene and was quite fascinated by the beauty of the transparent palace or whatever you called it...then I fell asleep. Watching this movie is like staring at a beautiful piece of oil painting for more than 2 hours straight; one can't been blamed for falling asleep once or more along the way. This film should be cut into a 3 minute trailer, because lets admit that a trailer is what it is."
4,Jeez ease up,"You know there are many a people out there who bash this movie relentlessly. Ease up, this was a pretty solid, and definately entertaining movie. I understand where the people who didn't like it come from, yes at times it seemed to be made for a much younger audience and yes Jar Jar is annoying as all hell. But this is still a very well put together and great movie. There are people who also dislike the so called ""new star wars."" But you have to understand, Lucas wrote these movie's years ago. And he wrote them in order all together. So this is the true start of his vision. If you can suck it up and manage to suffer through a few stupid Jar Jar lines, then you will really enjoy this movie. Which ""YES"" is good enough to be placed next to episodes 4,5 and 6."
5,Original Trilogy...where are you?,"Ok, this DVD is great. The Beginning documentary is absolutely fantastic, probably the best extra on a DVD in a long time. The deleted scenes which were completed for the DVD are also quite cool. But all this just makes me want the original 3 Star Wars on DVD even more. Obviously Lucas can put together a very excellent DVD, so what is he waiting for with the originals. Come on George- there are millions of people waiting for Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi to come out on DVD, what's the big hold-up??? Now that you've released Phantom Menace (which is certainly the worst star wars of the bunch) you should release the others.I heard he wants to release them in order, so he won't release 4,5,& 6 until 2 & 3 are made and released. If that is true then i guess we'll have to wait another 5 or 6 years to see the original classic Star Wars trilogy on DVD. Too bad DVd's probably won't even be around by then."
2,Less than I'd except!!!,I'm suprised at this movie. I was realy cheesed off. I thought this would be some great scifi drama like the last 3. You could call this a kids movie practicly. In the movie the good guys will only nuetrilise threats if they our non living. Naboo all they talk about is we must realy on negotioations. Even when the power is out. There was no siege at all they didn't even go down figting on there own. It reminds reminds me of the halacust. They dont't even pick up a laser until the Jedis come.
4,great movie but will sound also good in DTS,Its a pretty cool movie and it is THX certified but most people own receivers with dolby digital and DTS encoding. And you audio folks know that DTS sounds way better than regular dolby digital. WIll you guys make a DTS edition also???!!!
3,Plenty of action,I found that this movie had all the action that one would come to expect of a Star Wars movie.Character developement was not bad either.The only character I had a problem with was that of Anakin-played by Jake Lloyd. I found this character to be quite annoying at times. I could not tell if it was Jake Lloyd's inability to act or if it was an incredibly bad script for him.Overall the movie is very entertaining and children will love it.
1,Now we are getting mad!,"Star Wars is one of the most lamest, overrated films in history much like Lord of the Good 'Ol Ringos. Same goes for this.What is it with trilogies? They are pointless, usless things to make people anticipate the next film and trick you into believing in something that is not there.First off, let me say, if a human being can comprehend the storywithin this movie, kudos to them. On the otherhand, kill themoff so a movie like this will never exist again.To boot, every actor in here is annyoing as can be. I never like Liam, and I think it would take a lot to make me. Ewan is ugly,and that goes for the Portman chick as well. I don't mean to be shallow, but hey, if you can't stand to look at the actors what is the point?The film never ceases. End already!"
2,Like watching paint dry...,"With the exception of some exciting scenes (pod race, light saber fight), this movie was a disappointment. The potential was there, but it turned out to be a real snoozer. The special effects are first rate, though."
1,Bad Movie,"Okay, there are those of us who hate this movie (me included). Then there are the people who tell us it wasn't that bad (usually not Star Wars fans). I understand that expectations were high. Basically what it boils down to is that if this was the first movie released instead of Star Wars (Yes, that's the name. NOT A New Hope), would people really think it was any good? Probably not. Would it spawn any sequels? Probably not. I really tried to like this movie for months, but when I ask myself those questions, I realize that this was a really bad movie."
4,Starwars Episode 1,"I have seen this movie two times and each time I was on the end of my seat. This movie is very exciting but not very funny.I liked Darth Maul,Obi and Qui-gon Jinn. My mother went to go and see this movie with me because she knew that my Dad had gone to see it the first day it was out,and my Mom even liked the movie a lot."
3,The Phantom Movie,"For starters, the Phantom Menace is one that needed a little more ummfff- or some more pazzaz. It contained some errors that I hope won't blunder the entire STAR WARS storyline. However, the movie does present itself as a science fiction movie should - dazzingly, imaginative, and stunning, as well as a good storyline. But the story was plagued in some ways. It left me with a lot of questions that I hope will be answered by Lucas in the next movies yet to come. For instance, How come Qui-Gon didn't disappear?, Why does Anakin not have a father?, and What was Jar-Jar's role? Whatever the disappointment we may have felt, the movie was terrific if not entertaining. It surpassed many other movies I saw during the year and made me yearing for George to write and make the next two. The movie goes to show us that you don't need violence (bloodshed) and nudity to make a moviegoers go wild."
5,Episode I was GREAT!,"I don't see how people can say that the movie wasn't any good, it was great. All of the cast did a great job, and the graphics were the best yet. I can't wait to see the next one, because it'll most likely be as good as this one. Ewan McGregor needs to keep up the GREAT acting skills. I'll admit there is one thing I didn't like about the movie and that was when Qui-Gon Jinn got killed, he needed to make it to the second movie."
4,Star Wars Upgraded,"A Prequel must move us from a trilogy that I watched from start to finish over 30 times and fit into the sequence as smoothly as possible. The Phantom Menace did that for me. Yes, there was some lack of a specific villian but it had to tie back into the trilogy and get us back to Darth Vader. We're there and ready for the next action packed movie. I intend to buy this on DVD and suggest that you consider the same action."
5,George: Ignore the complainers,"This movie was the equal -- in theatre experience -- to Episodes 4-5-6. The ones saying it's not as good as the other three and pointing out things the others had that this didn't would be the first ones to carp if Episode 1 had been to similar. A potentially tragic development came to light today (Feb. 9), however. Variety is reporting that Lucasfilms insiders say Episode 2 will attempt to avoid the ""racial and ethnic stereotypes"" that supposedly plagued Episode 1. If these politically correct whiners don't like the movie, here's a novel suggestion: DON'T WATCH IT! As Article 3 in the Bill of No Rights states: ""You do not have the right to never be offended."""
5,Phantastic film,"This was the movie of 1999. Im glad to see that we ended the millenium with one of the greatest prequels of all time(one of the only prequels of all time). I expected a movie which did not encapsulate the mood and feeling of the previous Lucas masterpieces. Not only did it exceed these expectations but it went one stage further, it had the force. Being the author of many books and journals on Star Wars and Lucas's previous works i feel that he has opened up the Star Wars epic to a new generation."
4,Not as great as the original..,"I liked finding out more about Obi-Wan Kenobi's past, but the movie has a hard time keeping my attention. It also sparks more questions instead of answers. I did bumped it up to four stars since there isn't 3.5 stars."
2,A boring mess,"I for one was very dissapointed with this first in the prequel trilogy in the Star Wars saga.To me, ""Phantom Menace"" is just a mess of bad script writing, weak acting by the cast, and just mediocre dialog. The storyline was weak and sadly, ""Phantom Menace"" damaged my faith in the Star Wars prequel trilogy until ""Attack Of The Clones"" came along.The Pod Race scene though in my opinion was extremely awesome and saved ""Phantom Menace"" from hitting the bottom of the garbage can.Still though, overall, ""Phantom Menace"" in my opinion, adds nothing to the legendary Star Wars saga.Things though got back on track with the vastly superior ""Attack Of The Clones""."
2,"Nice effects, terrible script and acting","After 16 years, Star Wars fans finally got the first episode proper of the popular film franchise. Sadly, it failed to deliver on nearly every front. While Lucas' special effects are once again top-notch(although many other movies nowadays have equal or better effects), the screenplay and acting performances are insultingly bad. Okay, so the only Star wars actor/actress to ever be above DUD is Alec Guinness(and Jar Jar Binks gives the most convincing performance in this movie), but the script here is offensive. We have stereotypical charcters representing Asians, Jews, etc. and the whole thing is rather offensive. I'll give it two stars for great effects, but it really detracts rather than adds to the Star Wars legend."
3,Why do people hate this movie?,"I mean there are a lot of things I Don't like about this movie but it's still good. The reason I didn't like it was the kid who played Anakin Skywalker, he was a terrible kid actor. Natalie portman was good as the Queen, but I thought her outfits were way to over done. The movie itself had no where to go and it doesn't seem to fit in with the Star Wars Trilogy. Although with all those problems the movie is still enjoyable to watch and it's harmless entertainment and is good for children. There is no violence or gore. The DVD is OK but it could have been much better. If you are a Star Wars fan buy this otherwise wait and see if there is a collection of all six movies in 2005 and by the way why aren't the original three Star Wars on DVD?"
3,It's okay,"This is an okay movie. It has it's flaws, like every other movie. The story is not the best in the world. Neither is the acting. Still, I think some of the acters did very well. Ewan Mcgregor is very good at his part. Natelie Portman did a fair job. ( She is much better in episode 2.) But Jake Lloyd? I never liked his acting from the first time I saw Jingle all the Way, much less in a Star Wars movie. Jar-Jar Binks is very annoying!I think him, and Jake Lloyd ruined the movie.I think people were ecxpecting this to be more like the old ones. But come on, it can't be exactly the same, when it is baseddecades earlyer. The dark side has not completly formed yet, sothis movie can't be as entertaining as the old ones. Over all this is a prety good movie. In my oppinoin Episode 2 is better."
3,i'll be watching george lucas's career with great intrest,dissapointing.no storyline whatsoever just a mumble jumble of special effects and silly lines.how could that young anakin skywalker become DARTH VADER.only liam neeson and ewan macgregor are any good.jarjar binks is amusing but he's not right for star wars.darth maul is a bit part and he isn't the same as darth vader.did anyone even notice samuel l jackson on the jedi high council?.also where's boba fett?i've seen episode 2 now and he's in that but why not in episode 1.compared to episode 2 phantom menace is awful.i gave 1 star for acting and 2 for special effects.below is the main cast:qui-gon-liam neesonobi-wan-ewan macgregoramidala-natalie portmanjar jar-ahmend best
1,beh,"I've heard people complain and say that this movie is too much of a kids film, but that's being unfair to kids films. If you want to see a more creative kids film then watch ""The Neverending Story"" or ""Labrynth"". This movie's trailers hyped up the podrace, but if you want to see an exilarating ride watch the magic carpet ride from ""Alladin"". Finally if you want to watch a kids film with good characters then watch ""Goonies""."
4,A great DVD,"If it wasn't for Jar Jar, Episode I would have been a great installment of the Star Wars saga, but of course, everyone knows that already. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this DVD -- particularly if you have a good home theater system. The sound is awesome -- it really makes good use of surround sound. The DVD also includes an interesting short on the making of the movie that has some good behind-the-scenes insights into casting and special effects (although you cringe every time you see the guy in the Jar Jar suit . . .) Several scenes that were cut from the final movie are also included, but after seeing them, I can see why they were cut -- they are not particularly interesting."
5,Worth the wait!,"I hear a lot of people dogging this movie because of the lack of a story compared to the first movies. Well if you haven't noticed yet the first trilogy didn't have all that spetacular of writting. The movies fall into a classic fairy tale setting except that it's out in space instead of in Camelot. People you got to remeber that these are kids stories and you have to take them for what they are intended. Most of you all were introduced to the story when you were a kid, and I'm sure that most of you know that it doesn't take much to entertain a child.So to enjoy this movie you have to remember what it's like to be a kid agian."
4,Nice and cute film.,"You gonna love it if you are a Star Wars fan. Its somehow more cute than it should be, but still, it's fun and exciting."
1,too bad there is not a negetive five star rating.,"Boy did that stink!I agree with one of the previous reviews,it should be terminated,with extreme prejudice (killed). This should get negetive five star rating."
4,Star Wars is Back!!!,"If you are a Star Wars fan, then you know that this is the first Star Wars movie to be released on DVD, which is a big deal.The movie is just ok, George Lucas seems to be a little bit rusty after a long hiatus of adding to the Star Wars universe. This is the first Star Wars movie, and introduces many of the character that millions have come to know and love such as C3-PO and R2-D2.The film follows the early childhood of Anakin Skywalker, the soon to be Darth Vader that we see in the original three films. The story moves along at a medium pace and includes all the usually Lucas fanfare of special effects and aliens. The pod racing scene is especially memorable.For anyone that liked the original Star Wars films than this movie will be enjoyable. It's key in understanding much of the Star Wars universe. A good film to say the least!"
2,Does anyone remember when Star Wars was cool,"Truely, What the heck happen here. You've all seen it so I don't have to go into great detail. I'm just bitter is all. It's like some evil version of George Lucas came out of his twenty year hibernation with the soul intention of destroying all that was good from our childhoods. For those of you who were born after Star Wars maybe you don't understand, they were not just movies. They were myths and legends and they helped form our imaginations. Good versus evil, adventure and excitement, we sought these through these movie even if jedi should not. Now, we get Jar Jar, Metaclorians and a childrens book plot. George, I know you are rich and powerful in this life but, for what you have done, I hope there is a power greater than us that will make you suffer in the next life."
1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,"Where to start. I cannot imagine this movie being worse. Did a monkey write the script? Could the acting be more amatuerish? The Jar-Jar Binks character is an absolute abomination, and the perfect descendant of those ridiculous creatures from ""Return of the Jedi,"" which looks like ""Citizen Kane"" compared to this joke of a movie. An utter travesty."
5,George Lucas,"This is a review of George Lucas...not his Star Wars series of movies. Amazon. com predicted that I would rate this movie at 4 stars. Actually I rate it at 5. But George Lucas himself dosn't even rate the first star. 24 YEARS TO MAKE 4 MOVIES????!!!!!! Someone wake this guy up and give hime a cup of hot coffee. We could have seen many more of these movies by now even allowing 3 years per movie we would have twice a much Star Wars on our shelves. His marketing sucks. He waited far to long to release Episode 1 on dvd not to mention episode 4,5,&6. Re-releasing movies to suck money out of our pockets. Waiting untill after the original trilogy is released in regular format to release THX wide-screen format. I have the Star Wars trilogy in Beta, Laser Disc and 3 different vhs versions and now he wants my money for DVD, and I'll likely be dead by the time I see the final dvd release of the original 3. Someone please help...George Lucas is subjecting me to a slow death!"
4,ryan hickneys stars wars review,"Well, it is my favorite movie, but it lacks of drama. I think most people think Stars Wars is all about action, but i think it should have comedy, drama, and action. Now that would give it a wonderful rating in the theaters. I loved the lightsaber battle, with Darth Maul, Obi-wen, and Qui-Gon. I thought the costumes were good too. If Episode 2 is like i said this one should of been, than Episode 2 will have no problems with making money. PEACE EVERYBODY."
1,Please remember to recycle,"There isn't enough bad things to say about this movie. It's a ""comic"" without the ""relief"" in it. Because this movie is nothing but a comic horror, and a boring one at that. Thank God for Star Wars: Clone Wars, because this pile of junk wasn't the force worthy. Horrible acting, horrible plot, horrible computer graphics, horrible!"
3,A definate looker,"This movie is essential to the Star Wars fan! However, those who have not seen the light will find the movie to be slow at times, a little like a soap opera where if you miss something you won't understand what's happening later. Typical to Lucas, the effects are something beyond belief, or more accurately, they make you believe..."
1,Jar-Jar Binks leads the dissapointment,"I love Star Wars, saw the Phantom Menace at Universal Studious Cinemas, California, when it was release on the first day. The supposedly great computer generated special effects made the film look like a cheesy computer game. Worst of all, Jar-Jar Binks was so annoying and I certainly feel that Darth Mau would have immediately increase the rating on the film if he would have cut Jar-Jar into pieces in the first scene. They no longer do things like they used to, in terms of quality. The first 3 Starwars film will always be great, however, Episod 1 is certainly a Menace for the Star Wars collection. Hopefully Episod 2 is a lot better, I am certainly not looking forward to seeing Jar-Jar, unless of course it involves the new Darth Mau doing us a favour, sending him back to where he came from, below ground level."
1,Padme Needs a new Hairdresser!,"Padme really needs a new hairdresser. In certain scenes, her hair looks like a paint brush. Obi-Wan has problems, and a really heavy Scottish accent... ""Blast us into oblivion"", if anyone who has seen the movie remembers that scene, they'll know what I'm talking about. The boy who plays Anakin can't act at all. He is a really annoying brat! They should have used Hayley Joel Osmond from 'The Sixth Sense'. There is no blood in this movie like in the original trilogy...and almost no concept to the story. It is not developed fully.~White BirdP.S. What did they do to Obi-Wan in Episode II? He looks 45 years old!"
4,good movie,"I thought this movie was better than the other prequels because alot of real environments were used (such as Mos Espa) rather than green screens.Although using computer graphics for the droids may have been cool in 1999; today the computer models look worse than in some video games I've played.I think everyone agrees this movie could have been better, and more could have been done with Darth Maul, however I still think its a pretty cool movie."
1,I didn't quite suffer too much but........,This movie was awful. The reason I didn't suffer too much is because it did have some good visuals and special effects. That was all this film had that was good. The acting was the worst in years. The story was non-exsistent. Did we even care about any of the characters? And as for the worst of all the villains. They were unintersting and not even worth disliking. This movie was a waste of a lot of money (not just mine) and it seems as it were forced. It does not even deserve the name of star wars.
1,"technical brilliance, terrible script","Despite incredible CG and the definitive example of how audio post is DONE in the pod-race scene, this movie was the worst I'd seen since Godzilla. I suppose we should have seen it coming after Lucas emasculated episode IV in his ""special edition"" fiasco: Greeto shoots first? Lucas is an excellent movie producer, his company defines the state of the art in effects and sound, but he should leave the writing to Kasdan, et al. ""Yippee!"" - enough said."
2,In a galaxy far far away things got lame!,"Well now, I've given this movie 4 chances now. And i still hate it. Dont get me wrong, I grew up watching star wars every day. But this movie isnt star wars, It seems to be a 2 hour long comercial for hasbro, And the many other marketing scemes G.L. has come top exploit with his movies. But you cant blame him, After all it's all about the bottom line, eh?If the next two movies reflect any similartiy to this one i'll be staying away from them. And if jar jar makes another apearance, Oh please help us all. And for george, Why not focus on a movie instead of money? You had a great thing, And now it just seems tainted. Well kids im almost finished whining. One last thing, Make george put the indiana jones movies on dvd dang it! Oh yeah, the movie got 2 stars cause even i have to admit the battle shots ruled, May the force be with your wallet, I know it's with georges'."
2,more then a decade of waiting for this ?!,"This movie has it all : ACTION , BIG stars , EXPENSIVE & STUNNING special effects and somehow it doesn't come to be this great movie I've expected it to be .. maybe it is the somewhat childish script and acting ( of Jar-Jar and other CG carachters ) which isn't convincing . While I enjoy watching the 1st trilogy over and over I wouldn't watch this one again ."
2,disappointing,"I am a huge Star Wars fan, but I found this movie very disappointing. The movie didn't make any sense to me, until I read some of the preliminary writing for the movie (which I read after seeing it). When I think of some of the great writing that has been done in the Star Wars universe, it makes this movie even more depressing. The effects are beautiful, but who cares if the story doesn't work?"
3,Not bad...,"Well, I don't want to spoil everyone's fun, but this movie is basiclly for the kids. For anyone who's ver seen and liked the original, I reccomend this as a renter to see if you like it. Jar Jar Binks, the ""comic relief,"" isn't funny (unless you're laughing at how incredibly stupid he is), he's just plain annoying! Hardly faithful to the Star Wars series, I reccomend A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi."
2,Phlpppppppppppp!!! (Sound of a LOUD Bronx Cheer),"This movie deserves the Bronx Cheer. It is the Star Wars version of Star Trek, The Movie (The first one). Midichloridians are the source of the Force!?! Puh-lease! THe only good part was the duel between Qui-gon, Obi-wan and Darth Maul. The rest was just too much. The only reason why it got two stars is that the worst Sci-Fi movie ever made (yes, Virginia, even worse than Plan 9 from Outer Space) Dune gets that dubious honor."
1,Dissapointing!!!,"I first heard the rumor about the Star Wars movies coming out on DVD about a week ago, and I got exited. That was until I saw only Episode I was coming out. What a dissapointment. The original films don't have a release date whatsoever. Whatever your feelings are towards Episode I, it should have come out the seme date as the originals."
4,Ok this is pretty good,I think ths is a great mvie the first time this movie is boring till the end when quigon dies and the darthmaul witch shooould not have happened he was COOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLL!!
3,I want my DVD.,"The debate rages on -- the movie was awful, the movie was great, it was better than Jedi, it was worse than Jedi, it's too childish, it's too commercial -- whatever. Personally, I believe the first trilogy were children's movies as well, but that fact was disguised by the absence of children as characters and revealed with young Anakin. Complaining that this incarnation lacks the depth of the originals is like complaining that the Power Rangers aren't as deep as the Ninja Turtles were. These movies are eye-candy and escape, and Episode I doesn't disappoint in either category.The reason for the three stars is Lucas' mercenary merchandising. Thirty dollars is too much to pay for a VHS tape, even if it has a little booklet with it. C'mon Lucas, give the people what they want: A two-disc DVD with deleted scenes, director's commentary, and an option to digitally remove Jar-Jar."
4,Special effects are amazing,"I am not a Star Wars fan but thought I would give this a go, and was surprised to find I actaully quite liked it. The storyline is slow at times, the acting is certainly not great (even with Liam Neeson), but the special effects are simply brilliant. Most people seem to be disappointed by this movie probably because they are Star Wars fans from way back and maybe this movie didn't live up to their expectataions, but I was most impressed and will probably get the second installment now and work my way right through to number 6.Basically, this is a good introduction for all non Star Wars fans, so I would advise to give it a go, you may be surprised to find you actaully like it."
5,Highly underated,"This is just an installment in the series. Far too many people have lambasted this movie because it didn't meet their exaggerated expectations. Put into context, I think it was great, and a neccessity to introduce many different characters. There were great moments where Anakin and Obi-wan meet for the first time, and in the end when Palpatine refers to Anakin after helping defeat the droid army as ""young Skywalker"" in the same voice and intonation as is heard in Return of the Jedi as he speaks to Luke. Yes its not exactly the best of the series, but a must have for any fan. OK... we could have all done without the moronic Jar-jar in the same way we could have done with the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi"
1,Star Wars begins it's entry into children's fodder.,"Great movie for kids. As an adult, I am disgusted with the whole Star Wars franchise at this point. Between Episode I and this over digital produced kiddie flick, I won't even bother with Episode 3. I think what I miss most from the original series is Harrison Ford. A real actor. Not a computer generated Jar Jar Binks. Bring the kids! Any adult who finds this fodder ""great movie making"" probally loves ""The Muppet Movie(s)"" and ""The Goonies"" The ruining of a perfect trilogy."
4,A good movie,"This movie was good and very entertaining. The only part I didn't really like is Jake Lloyd's acting. But, overall, a good movie with some humor added, and great action sequences. It's worth bying."
4,The story begins,this is the long awaited prequel. Because of advances in movie making technology (I.E. Computer ANimation) the prequel appears more advance than the original series. The story begins with Gon Jinn rescuing Anakin Skywalker. He begins his training as a Jedi. In the nean time the trade giuld has established a blockade of the planet naboo. Gon Jin and Obi wan Kenobi go to the aid of planet naboo. There they face a dark Jedi called Darth Maul. He kills Gon Jin then Anakin is left in the care of Obi Won Kenobi. The story sets up the conflict between the republic and the enemy forces of the dark side. There is instability in the force and Gon Jinn believes Anakin can restore that stability but the Jedi counsel have doubts about the young Anakin..
4,"Not as good as parts 4-6, but not as bad as most are saying","Most people were so hyped up for the release of STAR WARS, EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE that it was just a huge letdown for them. It's far from the best in the series, I will say that, but it's not bad, by any means. It's cool, because we finally get to see Darth as a little boy and we learn his backstory, along with the rising of the Republic and the onciming tension between them and the Empire. Also, we get to see Yoda a few hundred years younger! But, check it out if you haven't yet, because it's not really a bad movie. Just don't expect it to be the best in the series."
5,A DVD set worth purchasing,"Leaving the movie commentaries aside, I consider this an excellent DVD set.The video and sound quality are excellent, the second disc provides a considerable amount of extra material, including TV spots and theater trailers, deleted scenes, various documentaries, picture galleries, an introduction to animatics and how they were integratedd in the movie, the making of the movie, plus the fantastic and highly emotional ""Duel of the Fates"" music video. It is a very well organized disc, very easy to navigate and full of interesting goodies.In the Making Of you can see George Lucas in action during various crucial moments of the movie's filming and producing, including casting, editing, plus inside videos of various crew and cast members. It turns out to be highly educational for movie fans.The movie disc together with the second disc makes this DVD set worth purchasing and that's why I humbly recommend it to you.Enjoy this classic."
3,Too much hype,"This movie had a lot of expectations to live up to, and it didn't live up to any except the great graphics. The two greatest characters in this movie are killed off. Darth Maul was a great and formidable ""bad guy,"" and Liam Neeson was wonderful. Anakin was dreadful, the child couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and Jar Jar Binks was probably the most annoying character I have ever witnessed in a movie, or even real life. Maybe if you have young kids you'll like it, but if you want something like the originals, it's not worth it."
4,an o.k. start but not the best of the lot,"to me the best of the series is still espisode 4 a new hope!!! i can still remember seeing it in 1977( WAS IT THAT LONG AGO) and i have been waiting for this one for a long time, but i found this one a little less than i hoped it would be. it still rates better than most movies out there but this one felt a little to rushed story wise, as if mr. lucus was eager to get to II and III and just wanted to get I under his belt. not a bad film just slow in spots. but still worth the price to see this begining of the best series in movie history!!!!"
3,Ok movie...Near Perfect DVD!,"Star Wars Episode 1 maybe a disappointment ,but George Lucas always keeps something special in store, waiting to the perfect moment. When DVD's were expanding he released Episode 1 on DVD with a 2 disc set and tons of special features including totally redone deleted scenes how can we be mad at the guy that his life is build apon Star Wars(and Indiana Jones, but thats another story). I saw episode 1 again after the Attack of theClones(bore) and I gave it a thought that truly it wasn't a bad movie(,but it was the Willow of the Star Wars Trilogy). It needed connections to the IV, V, and VI episodes or else this was a totally differant movie. So if you liked this one you my like episode 2 better!"
1,NOT the sci-fi classic any of the other movies were,"Part of what makes the Star Wars trilogy so timeless and enjoyable to watch today is that it was written and produced for adults, which we all gorw up to be. Sure, we may have missed some of the jokes and misunderstood the characters when we were younger but understanding it now makes the movies worth watching over and over again. Episode 1 on the other hand is a feel good kids movie with about as much depth and intellegence as a McDonalds kiddie soda. McD's should come up with their own marketable character rather than making Star Wars enthusiasts suffer through the idiotic ramblings of JarJar Binks. This movie is a short sighted sell out. I hope the chocolate shakes and stuffed animals George Lucas sold on this one made him a fat profit because this movie has no place in an adult's movie collection. Hold onto your money, rent this one if you must see it at all."
1,Utter Disappointment,"I was waiting in anticipation for this movie to come out and was one of the first in the world to see it. But sadly within 10 minutes into the film I was horribly saddened to see that Lucas has turned this film into a childrens movie. Something that should be seen on Disney. Horrible characters, just plain horrible. Ruined the film completely. Jar-Jar Binks was the worst. Just to hear the name sends me into a state of depression. I sure hope for his next film he rethinks how he is going to display his characters.There was no sence of deepness to this film. A five year old child could tell me what everything meant and what the end result would be. Bad. Bad. Bad. I would have rated this film zero stars but I must admit the effects were rather nice. So one star it is."
4,"Descent movie, good box set","I enjoyed this movie, i do not see why everyone was soo dissapointed in this movie. It is worth about 3 stars in my book, but with what you get in this box set, it raised my rating a star. Pros of the movie are: Good special effects, Cool fighting scenes, and a cool pod racing scene. Cons are: Predictable, and not as worthly of a movie as its preceders. But, never-the-less this movie is average. If you like Star Wars, you should enjoy the contents of this box set. It contains a movie reel and the movie and a book(i am pretty sure it is the screenplay, but i cant remember for certain.)"
2,I have a bad feeling about this,"If you were like me, you thought this film would equal the Second Coming. However, the movie is a huge disapointment. Granted, the special effects and ship and creature designs are excellent, but there are just too many things wrong with the film. Can you explain to me how every single character can act as bad as they did? The young Vader couldn't act out of a paper bag, Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character in the entire Star Wars universe, and Ben Kenobi tried too hard to live up to his name. Its too bad that Darth Maul didn't have a bigger role. His fight scenes were amazing, but we knew next to nothing about him. Maybe Lucas will take note and try a little harder on Episode II. This movie proved that he is not the absolute genius that some people think he is. How will he screw up next? Stay tuned!"
3,"Wider is better, but not much.","The Phantom Menace was perhaps the most-hyped movie of the century, but that hype was something it could never live up to. The special effects were amazing, but the storyline was severely lacking. Of course, every Star Wars fans knows this by now, as well as a good percentage of the rest of the population.The consolation here is that if you want to buy the movie, you should buy the widescreen edition so you're not missing half the cast. Of course, fans with enough patience can always wait until 2010 to buy the DVD."
2,There's no turning back from Jar-Jar.,"Can special effects be the entire movie? The actual stars (Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, and Natalie Portman) definately weren't selling the picture. And that is a big part of the problem as to why ""Star Wars: Epiosde 1"" wasn't good, the other three Star Wars movies didn't use big film stars and they were great successes. The casting, storyline, and over use of visual effects made this film such a dissapointment. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if it didn't have so much to live up to."
3,Seems more like a LucasFilm Demo reel,"This movie is not as bad as everyone says. Unfortunately it is a victim of its own hype. Truth is, if this movie didn't have the title ""Star Wars,"" all those fanatics out there (who spend 40 days in line to see it, with no life) wouldn't have hated it as much. People were expecting too much.They were right about a few things, however. The movie does not have the emotional impact that episodes 4,5, and 6 had. And the special effects were way too dense, Lucas needed to calm down with those. And yes, Jar Jar hurt the movie.Overall a welcome addition to the series, and not as bad as some fanatics say."
4,"It ain't as thirlling, but it is STAR WARS after all","Well, just sit back open your eyes and ears and enjoy. Best viewd with big screen and a great sound system, but it is allso great with 21"" TV. A great film by Lucas, not boring for a second and a well done graphics work. All in all this movie is worth every dime you think of spending. Do buy the Wide screen version, the stuff inside is thrilling and is woth a lot more than payd for. in one word - ""I loved it"""
2,Star Wars by way of the Muppet Show,"Phantom Menace is yet another example of Hollywood trying to create drama, suspense, and entertainment through the use of special effects without any real essence of well crafted storytelling. The movie is chock full of banal dialogue, along with ridiculously silly characters. Here you have human characters that are so one dimensional that you find yourself actually drawn in to the Muppets that appear in the film (Muppets you would expect in a Barney children's show). However, as is the trend in Hollywood, it seems that this sort of sophomoric movie-making is respected (i.e. ""Titanic's"" sweep of the Oscars a few years ago.) And I will state that Jar-Jar Binks is so grossly annoying and stupid a character, that his appearance would hugely diminish a great film, of which Phantom Menace is NOT. So here, the damage was unestimable. Stick with the original three, or rent it for your early gradeschoolers. Oh, by the way, the special effects were great."
1,"Please stop these, why do you insist on it??","just a message to Goerge Lucas asking him, why do you insist on continuing these story..!???, YES star wars was marveleous, (at its time of production) and it is still so good now to watch, and the following two parts ""the Empire strikes back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" was compatible with the First version and were suitable to be produced, but now, ""the phantom menace"" is so so ordinary, these kind of movies is not suitable at all for our time, the movie production technology is very high now, we dont need more space movies, the star wars triology is spectacular, it was unique and ...stop... any thing more will be so poor in comparison with the first one, pleeeeeaase, stop it Mr. Lucas, dont ruin what you did."
3,Somebody wake me up.,"I admit I am not the biggest Star Wars fan, but this movie did put me to sleep. I just found the acting and the storyline horrible.What is even worse is that the DVD is so uneven in its video quality, that I found myself constantly checking my DVD player to make sure there was nothing wrong with it. Argh!The video presentation on this DVD could have been SO MUCH better."
2,THIS FILM IS A LETDOWN,"The main problem with the movie is Jar Jar Binks. There is no getting around it. Millions of people hate his rubber guts. He was given so much unfunny screen time that I won't be satisfied with Episode 2 unless those ...clones roast him alive on a spit....P>While EP1 isn't a terrible movie, its inferiority to the original trilogy is apparent if you watch this, then watch the originals. Sure, there is a certain amount of Geroge Lucas goofiness that is part and parcel with the Star Wars universe. Put in simple terms, the first three films were consistently fun, exciting and action-packed entertainment. EP1 is even flashier but is nowhere near as consistently fun... most of the movie seems to be either the plot exposition and set-up for the NEXT movie, or soul-robbing screen time for Jar Jar."
2,What an awful film,This edition to the star wars universe is crap. The actors looked utterly out of place when meshed with the CGI (the fault of the director). And haveing the movie pander to a 6 year old didn't help it any either. This movie was riddeled with pointless reaction shots from Anakin and JarJar. Instead of buying this peace of crap I got the Phatom Edit 1.1. This is a fan edit of this movie that ends up only being little under an hour and it's a better film for it.
1,Horrible,"This is definetely the most dissapointing movie of all time. The storyline is dull and not enjoyable to follow. The characters arnt great and help to add to the overall corney feeling of the movie. Theres a half hour pod racing sequence that just slows down the movie and you may fall asleep during. I realize that since this is a ""star wars"" I probably rate it more harshly then other movies but still, this movie was in the works for years and it would of been better left on the drawing board. I will never go to see episode 2 or 3 as this is a clear indication of the direction of these prequels. Stick to the original Star Wars movies, ""Episode I"" does absolutely nothing possitive for the series."
1,May the force be a load of junk,"I hate this film more than any other film I have ever seen. The dialog is some of the worst I've ever heard, I have never known any kids to ever say ""yippee"" at all, yet Jake Lloyd say it twice in less than two hours. I think every one knows that Ewan McGregor is a good actor, you would only have to see Trainspotting to confirm that, but he looks lost in this film, the same as I felt when I was watching this...Lucas has tried to defend this film by saying ""its for kids"" well that still doesn't get rid of the bad acting, weak script, flat direction and special fx which are far from special - it just makes it [bad] kids film!"
1,Biggest dissapointment in History,"When I first saw Episode 1 in the theaters back in '99 I was dissapointed. When I first saw the Star Wars Trilogy in the special edition, it was my favorite set of sci-fi movies (with the exception of episode VI). Every character in Episode 1 cannot act. Ewan Mcgregor and Liam Neeson seem like they're bored. Shouldn't they be excited that they're starring in STAR WARS???? The worst performances in the film would have to go to that little boy playing Anakin. By far the worst performance EVER in a star wars film. Hell, I CAN even act better. Episode 1 has lots of special effects and CGI, WAY TOO MUCH OF THEM. It's like watching a very beautiful playstation game. The script was also poorly written. It's like Lucas wrote it in his spare time. The only decent performance probably goes to Darth Maul, who doesn't even have any lines."
3,give this movie a bad plot,"hi i enjoyed the movie, but i give the story line a poor rating, it suppose to be about ivasion but basically they take off to a planet end up picking a boy to be the main point of the whole triology of the instalment. special effects were good. but a little more excitement in some parts, instead of dull. heard that they are coming with the movie for vhs only, but someplaces you can have it on cd dvd formatt but only part i enjoy is the fight scenes, instead of you have to rewinde to a certain section that is really not worth seeing at all, like i got bored in the middle. and certain part of the movie. hope the next 2 movies are good, some of the characters are good. but at least have some action more."
1,"Good special effect's, bad movie.","The acting in this movie was very bad. My favorit charictor in the movie was Jar Jar Binks, but even his ears went through people because the acter's never even stoped to look at how to do this. A discrase to Star Wars."
1,star bores 1,"where's the plot? prequels don't make since as far as story development. we alreay know the important stuff, so why take us backwards and force us to watch it. i'll tell you why... easy money. it is obvious luca$ doesn't have anywhere to go with this storyline. i will admit that the special effects were good and john williams still has it but, i would only buy this if it were on dvd. sorry george, not interested."
5,this is the bast movie to date,"Well, what can i say, this was absolutly the best film i have ever seen, and it is hard to wait another month to get it. But, i think that the people who say they don't like it have no idea what they're talking about. the only thing they can do is pick apart a well done movie, and point out all the things wrong with it. I think (just like TITANIC) it is becoming ""cool"" to say you don't like the movie. I also think even after waiting 16 years for antoher movie, people think Lucas owes them a lot. He OWES YOU NOTHING, and i take pity on the people who think he does."
1,A terrible shame,"I think Lucas was just too big a man in Hollywood. Rather than a collaboration of talent as in the original trilogy, you get Lucas doing what he alone wanted, with nothing but yes-men and admirers to get advice from. A terrible shame."
4,Not bad...,"I'm 16 years old right now, and when I was young and growing up I constantly watched all the Star Wars films. I loved them, they were awesome...This came out when I was 10. Naturally in my 10 year old nerd self, When I saw previews for Star Wars episode I, I freaked. I was like ""YEAH!!!"". SO I saw it...and hey it was good.I can agree, NOT the original. But still, GOOD. I really liked it. I though it was a good way to get a jump into Anakin's life. (Sorry...I wasn't one of the fans hoping for the prequel's to START at Episode III and continue on...Though I would love to see some new Vader action).I can agree with the annoyances, like Jar Jar Binks and 90% of the gungans...(But hey...Jar Jar had some great lines in there...""My give up...My give up!""). I did, however, like seeing young Obi-Wan, and I thought Qui Gon Ginn was one of the coolest Jedi's ever. I don't know why, but after seeing episode I I thought Qui Gon was cool.Overall...yea this DVD is on my shelf..."
2,Great graphics - flat sound,"I never thought that I would find myself giving a Star Wars film only two stars. I bought this movie at Amazon in the UK. Unless you have THX for the sound (and I don't know anyone here who does) the sound is a big disappointment. My Dolby Surround Sound sat silently twiddling its thumbs, making the whole experience flat. With the effects removed the movie has nothing, and relies entirely on the hype from the first three. I'm a BIG Star wars fan and was very disappointed. The Jar Jar Binks character needs to be ditched quickly, in order to retrieve the respect that the original triology has. Lucas could have done a better job with Big Bird. I hope that George Lucas tries to go for story quality, rather than easy bucks with the next episode. He can only try to fool the fans once."
2,Something Is Missing!,"Let me start off by saying that The Phantom Menace is an OK movie. Sure the graphics are amazing in this movie, but doesn't it seem that it might get a little boring if the special effects swallow the almost the WHOLE MOVIE?! There were not those suspenseful, dramatic, romantic parts in this movie. Take The Empire Strikes Back for instance. It was made in 1980 when there wasn't near the technology for special effects then, and STILL it was one of the most popular movies OF ALL TIME! So does there have to be that many computerized stuff in a movie to make it great? To me, there were too many annoying characters (Jar Jar Binks). If you are in to the special effects of the movie this IS the movie for you. If you are like me and actually want to have a good story in a movie, watch the original trilogy. They need to spend more time thinking of the story rather than finding effects that would impress the audience."
2,"The Force, or the Flop?","This is going to be short and sweet. The only good character was Darth Maul (Ray Park), he definitely had the best onscreen prescence and menace. KILL JAR-JAR! Liam Neeson's performance was flat, and Jake Lloyd was just plain unbelievable. Ewan McGregor was little better, all the acting was very boring, and there was no emotion! What attracted people to the original trilogy wasn't so much the special effects, but the great original acting and emotion that the actors poured out. I felt Episode I was basically a 2-hour commercial for Star Wars toys and to line Lucas' pockets, rather than remain true to the Star Wars ideal. Sorely dissappointed..."
3,Highly Disappointing,"I was expecting this movie to be a wonderful film, however I was quite disappointed when I saw it. The plot and character development was the worst I have seen in a movie of this anticipation. Jake Loyd, the young actor who portrayed Anakin Skywalker, is certainly no Haley Joel Osment. His acting was horribly monotonous. Liam Neeson must have been out of work at the time when he made this movie. An actor of his stature should not have made such a mediocre movie. The only good thing about this movie was the crisp and clear special effects. Save your money."
4,why do so many people feel the need to hate this movie?,"It amazes me how many people feel the need to bash this movie! it was, and is, at its heart, classic movie making! a type of film making we dont see and is missed in this day and age of Independence days, men in black and wild wild west's! Good story telling and innocence! things that dont exsist in much entertainment these days!this movie could never and would never meet the hype or the expectations of the original or empire strikes back(the best so far)!this is just the beginnng so all you nay sayers stop being such jaded adults and sit back and enjoy! if not go watch independence day zzzzzzz zzzzzzzz, oh sorry just thinking about that pile of goo made me fall asleep!"
2,The Dialog Was just AWFUL. Dissapointed but still Enjoyed,I was very dissapointed by the UNATURALNESS AND FLAT ACTING. Felt way too MR RODGER'S NEIGHBORHOOD'ISH. The Dialog and interaction between Young Darth Vader and his mother was just APPALING. Way too 'see spot run'. I'm just dissapointed with LUCAS and his attempt to 'clean-up' all his films. Let's just shoot for a G-rating next time Mr. Lucas?I love Star Wars 4-6 but this was the biggest dissapointment yet. I'm sick of the rated G mentality.
3,Not great,"I in reality give it ***1/2 stars, even though it was good, it had really good acting, a great plot, great FX and it was very thrilling, i didn't enjoy it as much as the original triology, also i didn't like that the technology of the spaceships is a lot more advanced than in the original one, i didn't hate Jar Jar Binks, i sort of liked him and disliked him, but anyways is a good movie, and i hope that the DVD comes with a DTS track, i have an amplifier with that purpouse and of course i buyed my DVD Player, not only to buy this one, but the original triology."
2,Lucas had all these years and he still got it wrong,"I waited years and years to see the prequel, and this movie sure isn't what I expected.Get rid of Jar Jar and the Gungans, get rid of Watto, get rid of Anarkin, get rid of the pod race, and you have a decent 1 hour movie.This book was such a disappointent I probably won't waste my money on the other episodes. ;-(Wah doh Ogedoda"
3,Not as good as it should have been,"The special effects were very good but the story line was lacking a litle and the acting was simply unnacceptable for such a great series of films. Ewan McGregor was the one saving grace of the film with a good portrayal of Obi Wan but Liam Neeson should thank God for letting him appear in it.Mr. Binks - it's all been said before.After waiting for so long I was expecting a much better film than this.Probably best to borrow this rather than buy it, because it is worth watching.May the next one be better"
2,It's a bunch of over-hyped eye candy,"I really cannot appreciate this movie in more areas than visual special effects. The plot was weak, the acting wasn't exactly top notch, and it just felt so... cliche. Granted, I'm not much of a Star Wars fan, but I know people who stayed in line eight hours to catch the first night who felt disappointed. Aside from some really awesome graphics, I can't give any credit to this over-hyped fluke."
4,"Remember, we're not 7 anymore.","A lot of 30 year olds are harping about how episode 1 was disappointing. Others say it was too directed at kids. Guess what? So were the first ones. Here are the facts:1) Watch it as a 7-year old, you'll love it 2) The characters in the first trilogy took 3 episodes to be developed. Give these guys some time. 3) Sure, Jar Jar can be annoying, but so can 3PO. 4) The effects are great. They are cutting edge. However, we are not surprised by them anymore.The key to enjoying this very good film is not to be expecting to be blown away like we were in 1977. It's not perfect. It has its flaws, but so did episodes IV-VI. But it's science fiction which tells a story we have been thinking about for 17 years...and it's a pretty darn good story."
1,Corny,"What a really expensive yet completely awful film. Talk about a waste of celluloid. Jar-Jar Binks, anyone?"
1,I'd give it negative 50 stars if i could!,"I HATE this movie! It is sooo terrible George Lucas ruined it with his casting jake lloyd, who couldn't convincingly say anything in this movie. He can't act to save his life and Natalie Portman is pretty bad too. Jar Jar is stupid, the story is terrible, and the addition of ""funny"" lines terribly fall short. This movie is so worthless I can't begin to scratch the surface of it's utter stupidity. Trash these filthy new movies and watch the original trilogy."
2,In Brief,This is really a mediocre Star Wars film. You only want it to complete your collection. Even then consider sticking with just the original trilogy. Now that's Star Wars.
2,Not Much To See Here....Move Along,"The sad truth dawned on all of us watching Phantom Menace that this movie made Return of the Jedi look like Taxi Driver. With nothing but emotionless dialogue, bad acting from star Jake Lloyd and LONG gaps without any action Phantom pushes your patience. Add to that the tornado of annoyance that is Jar Jar Binks, and you have the weakest Star Wars movie in the saga. The menacing presence of Darth Maul is the only saving grace here, and the lightsaber duel is pretty impressive in it's own right. But the rest of the films flaws are just to much to suffer through. Kids will love it and it's great for introducing real young ones to the franchise, but otherwise just stick with the SW movies with Darth Vader on the cover."
5,this movie is realy woopen tushy,this movie was very very very good darth mall i like sha sha binks i like and itwas very funny to
2,It is a videogame not a movie.,"This is a terrible movie. I love the original star wars trilogy, but this movie is horrible. The acting is stiff, the dialogue is dead and the computer generated graphics are overwhelming, did I mention that the music is nothing special?. It looks and feels more like a videogame than a movie. TERRIBLE."
2,Disapointment,"This movie was [poor], big disapointment from the other 4. The DVD seems to be good though, I don't know, haven't seen on dvd! I don't plan too, because this movie blowed!! Looked like your in a game, and Mr. Lucas even admitted himself that this movie was made for the children!! Too bad, I think it was Jar Jar who ruined this movie, for the most part, it's too bad!! Hopefully the 3rd will be more like the 2nd one than the 1st, cause this one wasn't good at all! Especially all those dumb looking aircrafts, looked like they were made of really cheap wood or metal. Dumb movie, the rest of STar Wars is great so, skip this one and watch the rest!!!"
3,Not as Good,"Hey rent this movie, dont buy it. Episode II Is a far superior film. Episode I although with excellent fight scenes is few and far between in all the places where a Star Wars movie should be a smash bang success."
5,Watch This Movie TWICE Before You Rate It,"The first time I saw this film, my expectations were unrealistically high. Even though it was fantastic, I left the theater a tiny bit disappointed. However, the second time I saw it - with no expectations whatsoever - I was absolutely blown away. This movie is excellent - and you MUST have it in your collection."
1,You love it don't yah,"I think George Lucas just spilled his coffee. I better get out of the way for all of you dense and brain washed Star Wars fans out there to pick it up for him. I remember the first making of Star Wars video that came out after Return of the Jedi hit the streets. I remember him saying that special effects is just a tool. Special effects without a plot is a pretty boring thing. My god, I think he just dropped the ball once again. Attack of the Clones was even worse and the release of the originals onto dvd is a disaster. Face the music ladies and gents, the golden age of Star Wars has just left the building. We will never have another episode IV, V even VI again."
1,Worst movie ever.,"Well Star Trek V used to be listed as my number one worst movie of all time, but this one edged it out. I loved the others and was so disappointed at this movie which is basically a 2 hour toy advertisment. I heard Lucas's defense of the quality of the movie was that the movie is ""for kids"". Kid are not stupid George. Also nice rip off of the virgin birth story, geeze can you get less orignial?"
1,Highly dissatisfactory,"Even when some people try to save this insulting sequelae of SW, This film is an example of how easy is to fall in the temptation of using the past glory of a masterpiece as Star Wars to atempt to fool the educated espectator. This is not only not a fun movie, but a disgrace for the film industry itself. In spite of all those special effects, the overabuse of computer animation is worse that those seen in Jurassick Park (sequelae II and III), and the lack of inteligent and coherent plot is discouraging. It might be fun for people without filmic pretensions, but is so heartbreaking for us Star Wars lovers. Please Mr. Lucas, can you change the title of the next movies and separate them from the marterpieces we saw 20 years ago?, don't ruin our memories.Thanks"
2,I can't Believe they Call this Star Wars!,This movie was a mockery to all true hardcore starwars fans. It's not that it is that bad of a movie but i think we were all a little disappointed in this one. Maybe it's just me but i would have a higher standard coming from George Lucas himself. Jar-Jar Binks is what sealed the fate of this movie for me. I don't know about you but after waiting so long since the first series i think ol' George might have lost his touch.
2,"IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT","Imagine The Beatles getting back together - during the disco era. That's kind of like what goes on with Lucas' creation. First, if you're going to believe the events took place before the others, you don't use 2-dimensional (and extremely ""computerized"") computer-generated characters, spaceships, etc. You use physical, tangible, 3-dimensional models and do not surpass the effects - which are STILL spectacular - of the first three. Nothing new here. Same types of characters, same action sequences, and an extremely overdone score by John Williams. What it boils down to is that everybody has a prime. George Lucas has waited too long to try and hold on to and re-create his glory days. BOO! to The Phantom Menace. Just pretend it was never released and enjoy the original trilogy in its original prints. There's nothing new here."
1,Dumb and Boring,"I could not stay awake through this horrible movie. Had to fast forward through it because there was no way I could make it through the end. I had heard that this Jar Jar Binks character was annoying but I didn't believe he was that bad. A totally unwatchable film. Every actor, including Liam Neesom, Sam Jackson, and EwanMacgregor, mailed in their performance. The sereis would have never made it if this was the first movie introduced. Contrived and BORING!!!"
1,Lucas should be put in jail.,"What this guy did to his own Star Wars excellent saga is criminal. The dialogues... the acting... the plot -what plot?-, the characters -maybe except Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan- ... and... JAR JAR!!!George Lucas had not directed a movie for twenty years till he made this one, and it shows."
1,Jar Jar ruined it for me,"This would have been an average movie for me if it hadn't been for Jar Jar Binks, the CGI reggae-talkin' muppet that doesn't shut up. I couldn't imagine what lucas was thinking when he gave as many lines to Jar Jar as he did. And now, according to starwars.com we get to enjoy yet another installment of Jar Jar in Episode 2! Help us please.Overall I think that Lucas focused entirely to hard upon the under-12 age catagory when he made this film - i.e. Jar Jar's idiotic lines and young Anakin the hero. If he wants to redeem himself for the next 2 movies, Lucas really needs to refocus and stop thinking about how he is going to market the next version of the Darth Maul action figure."
1,Worst movie of all time,"This movie is by no doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't especially like the first 3, but they were still a lot better then this one. This movie was boring, stupid, and a waste of money. The thing that makes me the most upset is that the fans of this movie complain that it didn't make more than Titanic. They can't settle for having the 2nd highest grossing movie worldwide. It's not funny, or dramatical.The humor consists of a computer generated creature saying Doodie. The special effects are all computer generated. It's unexciting and seems to have no sense of purpose. Other then to sell merchandise and give George Lucas enough money for liposuction. Jake Loyd is a horrible actor. This film made 900 million dollars worldwide and it's basically just a bunch of posters moving really quickly. Halfway through the movie I left the theatre and went to the bathroom for about 20 minutes. I found the automatic flush to be more interesting then the movie."
3,Most boring Star Wars Ep. yet!,"I only gave it 3 stars because of the special effects. Was George Lucas so intent on getting the newest special effects right that he forgot about the characters that we all want to get to know and love? Liam Neeson was so boring, his performance so flat that I had to wonder if he was mad because his character dies in the movie and he just read his lines and showed up on the set when required. George, George, you can do better! Even the kid's haircut was so cereal bowl-typical Hollywood... yea, the kid was an okay actor, but that was it! None of the other actors are worthy of mentioning. Perhaps it wasn't their fault, perhaps if they'd had better supporting actors around them they would have had a little more personality or spark. My husband and I liked the ""how they made the movie"" segment better than the film itself. PLEASE! Make this one up to us Star Wars fans!! Give us some characters we can get involved with in future Star Wars epics."
1,this stinks,"Lets face it, if this film had not been a StarWArs movie. It would not have filled up the seats more than once. And no one in their right mind would have bought it!!!All the elements composing a movie are missing.This was made so that the bank account of mr.Lucas would become larger. Lets just hope that the last two are not of the same hopeless quality."
2,Well..........,"There isn't much to be said. So what if it wasn't relesed on DVD? The point is that this move lacked what the others had. The plot and characters (especially the Jar-Jar tibe) were more than a bit shalow, the acting wasn't great, and the script was terible. ""I'm so proud of you Anne"" Annican's mother sqeaks in an unnaturally high voise after he wins the pod race. ""you have given strength to those who have none."" Oh please! If Lucas works more on the plot, script and characters next time, they might live up to the originals."
3,Where is the DVD?,"Yes, Jar Jar is Dum Dum Dum. Steve must have been eating spinach when he came up with this character! Yes, the kiddie was a bit overdone, but after all, he's born with the (! ). Must agree with all others regarding a DVD release. Come on Steve, read the reviews, all 173 pages of them on this site, and get cracking. You evidently have not read the stats on the number of DVD players expected to be sold over the next two years! All the libraries that I know of are buying DVD's for circulation, and they are the most conservative of purchasers. Come on guy, and DVD it. It'll make the fans happy and also Amazon..Cheers"
2,"Yawn. Cough. Yawn. ""What time is it?""","Perhaps giving this movie two stars was a bit harsh. But, I couldn't bring myself to give it three. No way. It's just too boring. This is a movie that is truly sleep-inducing. The plot is a muddle--trade federations, knights fighting on behalf of commerce, a race here, a race there, muddle, muddle, seven large, indisinguishable underwater monsters, etc. Even my 11-year old couldn't stay up through it when we saw for the second time (the pain, the pain) on pay-per-view. I truly love the original Star Wars trilogy. But those films were good in all the ways this film isn't. A true fairy tale story form, great acting turns by the entire cast, energy and enthusiasm, and a great set of villains. The worst thing about this film? The AWFUL kid who plays the young Darth Vader. You'd think after an hour of filming they'd have dumped him. Hmmm. He must be related to George Lucas. Rent it if you must, but no need to buy the darn thing."
2,not what it could have been,"when i first saw this film i loved it,and i always remember thelight-saber duel beetwen darth mual and the jedi's. but nowafter wacthing it a few times i have seen that it really wasn'twhat it could of been. the film was made up of crummy diolugesome action and an ending that wasn't wprth the watch. also the film should have focused less time on jar-jar binks! he is a completly stupid charecter. the film although bad did have it's good parts and such.this movie is rated PG for sci-fi action\violence. the film deserved the rating,[like any other star wars] and the violence was kept mild. there was no languge kissing or any thing of that sort. it was not a scary film at all but it might not be the perfect film to take youre 4 year olds to.overall the film was not what it could have been and totally worse than the old trilogy."
4,Widescreen fan!,"This widescreen version of Star Wars episode 1 is not too bad,considering there was no DVD release at the time of its release. My beefs are that is is available only in this extra cost version. ... (The ONLY way to see a star Wars movie on TV) The film strip,book,and feautrette is not bad,but I would have preffered a WS Movie eonly tape piced the same as the pan/scan. Thankfully there is a DVD,but it's still important to have a widescreen VHS tape."
4,entertaining,a great film that improves with each viewing. although severalcharactors are in the movie briefly their presence leaves an impact. jar jar binks was one charactor our entire family especialy enjoyed. he created a sense of playfulness and humor.well worth the money to add this movie to your collection.
3,STAR WARS-THE PHANTOM MENACE,"As a long time STARWARS fan I expected more than what George Lucas came up with. The acting and dialoge was bad, but all of the millions that were spent on the special effects were great. I think we all could have done without JAR JAR BINKS; simply annoying. The truth, George left alot of holes in the story. For example, does R2D2 remember Anikan as one of his masters when he meets Luke? Over all, it's a STARWARS movie with not enough space action."
5,Don't judge a Star Wars movie by its Screenplay,Most people who have this movie says the screenplay stunk. I think it fits in well with the whole Star Wars plot. Once Episode 2 comes out i'm sure this movie will make more sense.
2,Sent me a scratched dvd,They sent me a movie that constantly skips. this was not stated that the movie was scratched. im very unpleased with the quality and truthfulness.
2,Truly an awful movie. Only wanted to complete the trilogy.,"This is by far the worst of the Star Wars movies (all of I-VI). Jar-Jar is torturous to watch as are young Anakin Skywalker, Watto, Sebulba, and the other cartoon creatures of this film. Only worth having in order to complete the set. This is the movie that makes it impossible to watch all six in a row, in a day. Plain and simple."
3,Where did Obi-Wan find the hyperdrive motivator?`,"My subject's namesake. Otherwise, a very good movie. Certainly a mezzo-forte on the grand schemata of Lucas' work, but very good nevertheless. Padmé Amidala's role is slightly defunct, but instrumental. Young Anakin Skywalker made an excellent performance at the Boonta Eve race, but otherwise just a bit mealy (like one of those apples that just isn't quite ripe yet and consists of chunks of firm tissue nodules). The Nubian blockade run was excellent. But where are the guns on the droid control ships?"
2,Bad but Good,A prequel is usually never even close to being a good movie because it usually assumes that the audience has already seen the previous films and know what's going on. This movie is no acception. In this movie all we find is the beginnings of character development and at the height of the movie we are made to watch a race in which everyone knows who's going to win. How entertaining is that suppose to be? The storyline is barely there. The only saving grace of this movie is that the acting is done decently by everyone that is involved on the screen.
3,A New Hope... for the future?,"I can't honestly say this was the worst movie of all time, but I truly was dissapointed with it. I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing about how bad the JarJar Binks character was, but on the other hand, maybe George will ditch him for something less marketable and more personable in the next two movies. Also dissapointing was the overabundance of CG animation. No matter how impressive computers are nowadays, it's still incredibley hard to fool the human eye, and Mr. Lucas actually did a better job scavenging battleship models and using puppets to create his special effects in the first trilogy. This movie wasn't a total loss however. The droids remained unchanged, and Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor are well on their way to making memorable characters. With a little work, they might become a little more identifiable as heroes."
4,anakin,"my only real problem with this movie was anakin skywalker. i know he's only a kid, but he really was an awful actor. episode 1 would have been greatly improved had they gotten Haley Joel Osment to play anakin"
3,My hopes were a little bit let down.,"The movie would've been superb if they had gotten a better Anikan and thrown out Jar-Jar. It was a mistake picking Jake Lloyd and I don't know what was going on in their heads when they did. He spoke in monotone and had no expression on his face at all throughout the movie and when he tired, it looked really chessy. And Jar-Jar was just as bad or worse. He is another alien creature to add comedy to the movie. I laughed but at how stupid it was. I remember the original movies were so funny with the driods and Chewbacca and the Ewoks were cute but suprissingly this was a let down. But besides those two actors the movie was great. The effects were ammazing and the lightsaber fights thrilling!"
3,Good film actually 3 1/2 stars,"I liked Star Wars Episode One.It isn't nearly as good as the original trilogy,but it's a good start to the Star Wars saga.It was very fun seeing Annikan Skywalker(Darth Vader) as an innocent little boy.(hard to believe what eventually happened to him!)The visual effects were fantastic.Some of the acting was a little weak,and some charactors underdeveloped,but on the whole I really enjoyed it.Now I really can't wait to see episode two expand on what episode one started."
4,There willbe more,"I thought this movie as a whole was not well. The acting was not all it needed to be, exeptions: Natalie Portman, & Darth Maul. I feel that this movie was just to set the weels spinning, the filler will come in the next two. Just like the original series. I've been a fan since 1977 and may be jaded but I feel that this was a film that had to exist to set up the rest. Effects, of course, were amazing as was the background. The plot was not where it should have been. The sotry as a whole not bad, not great either."
2,"Terrible movie, um, nice DVD extras","Alright I'll cut out all the negative Star Wars vibes for all the geeks out there, this film was just plain boring, pure and simple.Boring, boring, boring. It was really boring."
2,I really wanted to like this move.,"But unfortunately, this film was not very involving.George Lucas once said that special effects without a story can be a pretty boring thing. I'd wish he take heath to his own statement.While the movie does have some good effects, it's overuse of CGI was like watching a video game on a giant screen. It really became tedious after a certain point.I'm probably in the minority on this, but perhaps it was wise that Lucas NOT do these first three movies. In ""Star Wars"" we hear old Obi-Wan talk about the past. All of us had our own images on how that past must have looked like. Of course, all of that is now ruined. We now have Jar Jar Binks and bad acting by Jake Lloyd to visualize!"
3,AND TO THINK HOW LONG WE WAITED FOR THIS DVD,"George Luicas took a long time before putting out this DVD, and as an extra features two disc set, it is excellent. (...) I found Episode I boring and lackluster. Iam Neesen just seems bored by it all and somnambulates himself through the film.The CG effects are too obtrusive and all over the place.I suggest renting this but don't spend your money buyong it even thogh it is not expensive."
5,it's about time,"The extra features are great on this DVD and it's just time that Lucas decided to release one...While I can't say that the movie is the best of the SW family, I do appreciate more and more with every viewing (I suppose that I internally edit out the parts that I dislike and examine the best parts more closely)."
3,Great background but little content,"Lucas was definately thinking more of the special effects than the content of the story. I'm surprised he has content for a book! The only thing that made me buy it was the background and my seven year old nephew. I am a fan of the older Star Wars, from the time when special effects didn't take away from the story. I just hope Lucas' next endeavor takes us into the story and not just into the scenery. Just one more thing - If its not going to have content at least make the action sequences seem more believable and have more of them!"
2,This Movie is Horrible,"This is absolutely one of the biggest, overblown movies ever made. The marketing was brilliant, but the film was severely lacking in substance. Nothing really happened. They found anakin, and the senator (emporer) created a conflict. This could have been achieved in 15 minutes. Darth Maul was only in it for about 5 minutes, and the character of Jar Jar Binks seriously needed to be on the cutting room floor. The special effects were good, and I will buy it anyways. Hey, it's still Star Wars."
1,It sucks!,"It sucks. The phantom Menace was the worst attempt at a star wars comeback possible. With the exception of the billion dollar special effects the movie had horrible screenplay, acting, stage direction, and character development. Whatever you do don't buy this movie!"
1,Even fans have to admit that this movie totally sucked!,"The movie had nice special effects, there I said it. But the rest of this was an insult, fart jokes, stupid characters, lame plot points, bad bad bad acting, and overall just a horrible script. The direction of this movie was a joke, obviously they shot a couple takes then assumed the special effects would distract the audience from this ungodly mess."
1,please vote yes!,"Everybody who hates jar-jar binks vote yes if you would like to see a special edition where qui gon jin takes out his lightsaber,slices him into 6 pieces and sells him to hungary aliens to get money to leave the planet,instead of placing a bet on anikin to win the pod race."
1,"Jar Jar Binks, me thinks you stink!","The only way the next Star Wars Movie (""Attack of the Clones""... maybe because the title ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"" was taken?) can be any good is if Jar Jar Binks gets sucked into an X-Wing engine and shreaded into a fine mist! Lucas left out the one thing that made Star Wars great, gritty realism. The characters are too sweet, the ships to clean, and the plot too thin! Darth Maul was wasted... and so was my $$!"
3,A Star Wars flick...sort of...,"Alright, if you really dig the Star Wars films, you've probably already seen this one. If you have not, but have seen the originals, then I have these words for you: It's just not the same. Between the making of Jedi and Phantom Menace, Lucas lost something (I personally think it's his mind). He just isn't as good a story teller. The places we visit in the film (Naboo, Tatooine, and Coruscant) are simply not as richly described by elements of the film as they are in the first three films. Lucas basically leaves it to a few wide shots to show us what Coruscant is like, and obviously uses our knowledge about Tatooine from the original films as a crutch, an excuse not to explore the desert planet more fully in this one. Naboo is explored, but the annoyance factor of Jar Jar Binks keeps the enjoyment of even those scenes which really could have made the movie great at a low level. All in all, it could have been much better. I hope they do better with the next one."
2,Star Wars I is a big flop......,"I would like to say that any one who would consider buying this movie is a fool. this wa sthe worst ever Star Wars movie. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I woulnd't spend my hard earned money on that piece of crap movie. George Lucas, may have did an exellent job making that film, but the movie was slow, and had no relivance to the Star Wars plot what so ever, If you have not seen this movie, don;t wast your time."
1,"Hollywood's ""Technology God"" throws us a bone. . .","Oh boy oh boy. The first of what will doubtlessly be 14 different releases of E1 on DVD. I'm not rating the movie here, I'm rating the Lucasfilm Imperial marketing strategy. I have gone from child of the Star Wars trilogy to father of children who don't really give a damn about Star Wars.While I'm sure I'll buy a version of E1 on DVD, it won't be this one. I'll wait for the supermegaultra double trilogy that comes out in 2029.Proof positive that Lucas doesn't care about movies, he cares about marketing. The true Darth Sidious."
3,"I respect George Lucas, but...","This entire movie, except the end, was mediocre. I wish he didn't go back and do 1, 2, and 3 but he did and we have to live with it."
5,The saga had to start somewhere!,"The DVD itself has plenty of things packed into it. The movie; I thought it was a very good movie. I did initially watch it a couple times at the theater with my family. It took a couple viewings to begin to understand what Jar Jar was saying. Overall though, I think The Phantom Menace is a very good movie, especially with the light sabre battle between Obi Wan, Qui Gon and Darth Maul. Believable and stunning."
4,The extras don't feel obligatory,"I thought the movie itself was a little disappointing, though it did have flashes of brilliance. The DVD, though, has some nice features. Particularly of note is a nice and long documentary about the making of star wars. People who have seen a lot of DVD extras will probably attest to the fact that ""making of"" documentaries on dvds are usually 5 minute hype segments. This is not. This really gives you a feel of the work and effort put into the film, and makes you appreciate what being a director is like. It has elevated my respect for this movie, and made me feel like it's worth more than people give it credit for."
3,MOVIE [destruction],Ok so i thought his was going to be a good movie but i was soooooooooooooo disapointed like many fans. Kill Jar jar there is a lot of holes between this one and episode 4 queen amidala will almost get killed before episode4 so why not kill jar jar. Portmans dialog was so monatone that it dove me carzy it that there accent to have no emotion in there voice. jake loyd should of gone to acting school of had more trainers. I would much rather see a giant puppet (chewbacca) than jar jar at least chewie felt like a real person and he added somthing to the story and lukas didn't try to overuse him.this movie was a sad chapter in this saga i hope that the next one will have a story and emotion.THEY SHOULD OF JUST THROWN 150 MILLON ON A TABLE AND LET US WATCH IT FOR 2 HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT THE FILMAKERS BASICALY DID. OHH CAN WE PLEASE SEE ANOTHER C.G. SHOT UHHHH IT GOT OLD.
1,Lucas does it again,I originally bought this movie on VHS and tried to watch it on my 53 inch HDTV and had to stop it because the quality was terrible. Low grade tape made it look worse than is I recorded it off TV. So then I get the DVD and more of the same. The transfer was terrible the picture was digitized. The text for alien languages were jagged. Just terrible. So I'm sure Lucas will now release a superbit version so we have to buy it again and he gets more money.
3,A nice peek into SW history...,"For those of us who grew up watching the ""Original"" trilogy, this is an interesting peek into the history of the Star Wars universe, although I think Jar Jar's character was a bit too comical for the movie, I like the CGI effects and how the characters inteacted. The down side was that there wasn't the air of mystery in the force (we learn that it's generated by microscopic creatures in symbiosis with living things) which is a big disappointment for me."
2,A Very Disappointing Film,"In the original Star Wars movie the villains were interesting. Darth Vader was menacing, but you didn't hate him. A lit. teacher once told me for a movie to work the bad guy has to be likeable & interesting. Well in this movie they're not. Instead the villains have no depth or background. That's why Lucas had to make Darth Maul look like Satan. It's probably also why he had to add that crazy side kick Jar Jar Binks. Not that I hated it, it just wasn't worth a ten year wait. I honestly had the impression the only reason this film was written, was to set up the sequel."
1,VHS only? Yikes!,Special Effects extravaganza on VHS only? Yikes..I will not touch a VHS movie anymore regardless how good it is. Especially realizing George Lucas attitude toward DVD. Ban THX and Lucasfilm for not supporting 16:9 Anamorphic DVD!
1,OK,"The movie is OK, but not excellent. The performances are mostly bad and wooden, and Brett Roberts is cool, and I didn't really care for most of the characters. Yoda was way to grouchy and mean, and Anakin was a horrible actor. The was way to much fake CGI and I thought the special effects were laughably bad, because the whole movie looks like a cartoon or a computer game.By the way, Brett Roberts is very cool.Pretty boring also, not much action, what action there was was very unsatisfying, and Brett Roberts is cool.Overall, not worth the time, but Brett Roberts is still cool.What's happening homies. Yo G! I speak nonsense recials!Boo"
5,perfection,All I have to say about this movie is that it was SUPERB! My wife and I enjoyed it so much. It was enjoyable and full of exciting scenes. We can not wait to get the collection in our home. This movie can be described in one word: AWESOME!
2,"Effects Great, Movie Suck","I don't know what George is thinking. If this was his plan, he should have quit with Return of the Jedi. The story is weak and the acting incredibly poor. No amount of special effects can replace a good story and chemistry between actors. Give it up George, as a writer, you suck. As a digital artist, you are a genius."
4,A good family sci-fi,"This movie was ok, not what I expected, but I have watched it still quite a few times and own it. This is one of those movies that is more worth watching on vhs/dvd then the movie theater."
3,"Good DVD, Okay Movie","I enjoy the Star Wars triology and I grew up with the Star Wars figures, played the role playing game and couldn't wait until the new Star Wars movie came out. I'll admit, I was disappointed by the movie mainly because of the cutesie things that were put in. However, the lightsaber battle at the end of the movie more than made up for Jar Jar Binks. It was cool to see actual Jedis practice their craft. It was also cool to see the little boy that would eventually become Vader.The DVD itself and the extras are pretty well done as well. I never noticed before that they use different scenes each time you put the movie in."
4,Just Enjoy,"I go to the movies for escape, I don't really care if the plot has flaws(unless they are terribly glaring), I like the violence (as long as it's not dwelled upon) I love romace (as long as it's not Sharon Stone who can make a kiss seem like pornography). George Lucas does everything well, the plot is convoluted enough to make your brain work, the costumes and sets are exotic and lush and the special effects are marvelous. What more do I want- nothing. I thoroughly enjoyed the Phantom Menace and wish the next one would come soon. My one regret, there was no Han and Chewbacca, because Jar Jar frankly jars... If you didn't like it, so what, it doesen't spoil my enjoyment of it and the millions like me who just want to be entertained. I remember holding my son on my lap when we saw the first star wars, now he is a young man and feels the same fascination he felt then. That's good movie making."
3,Good.......that's it.,"By saying good, I mean (being a STAR WARS fan) ""damn why was it such a lame movie? "" For starters, Jar Jar Binks was a waste of time...I mean, is he loveable?........nope. If I got the chance I would tie his tongue to a speed train and let the rest to the beauty of dynamics......we'd have a dramatic Jar Jar scenery in red. Second point....The plot was simply lame....The good points: Lightsabres battles are spectacular.....they are...I was really trapped at moments. The trilogy lacks lightsabre action. The pod race......amazing.In conclusion.....a good movie but not as good as the trilogy. That may be beause luke, leia, chewie and han were much more sentimental than these her today."
2,Do I really need to plile on?,"You just have to look over to see the carnage of the auto wreck, don't you. We've all seen this hoax of a Star Wars movie so no need to add more. This time my 5 year old wanted to watch and I think he liked about 15 minutes of it total. Puke."
2,The most Played out Prequel,I think this movie was played out along time ago but to go and make the first episode was a waste of time and money. I think that the other star wars episodes were fine and then they have to go along and make a new one. This movie has been played out to many times
1,Im glad I only saw it once,"This was predictably bad. Star Wars has continued its downward slide that started with the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi"". It's really a shame that Lucas can't come up with a better plot and script. There has been alot of good material written for Star Wars, the Zahn novels and Dark Horse Comics series to name a few.I think Mr Lucas has lost his ability to be an artist and is more the businessman. Got to sell those Jar Jar binks dolls!PS The directors cut and special editions will be out after this DVD so he can maximize his profits. So if you can wait and actually like this movie, you'll save money."
1,Yuck,words cannot describe the atrocity george lucas has commited on mankind by making this movieDown with the anti-christ! Down with George!
2,This is what we waited for?,"George. Grow up. Sci-fi isn't supposed to be embarrasing. This movie was supposed to live up to the hype. It was supposed to be a treat for Star Wars fans off ALL ages. It was supposed to be literaly the BEST movie of the decade. What we got instead was one of the worst movies of 1999. It's a contender for the Annual Golden Raspberry Awards. ""Independence Day"" was FAR better! Please do better next time Mr Lucas. If you want inspiration to insure a masterpiece with the second film, please see ""The Empire Strikes Back"". I forgive you. Just don't let it happen again.:-)"
1,slightly less painful than a trip to the dentist,"I am astounded that anyone liked this film. Even 10 year olds should know better. Jar Jar Binks should be killed off soon, but not before Lucas himself. Answer me honestly, does anyone really like this film? I know, I know, we were all excited to have another chapter come out in our life times, and it could never have lived up to the hype, but this is more than a disappointmet. It is utter worthless garbage. A waste of money and time."
3,good,"this was a good movie the people who gave it a bad review saw the movie went in with the wrong mind frame. jake lloyd wasn,t that bad. his part just need to be written better. his was good in his other movies."
1,cinfusing,i liket the red guy with hte floppy ears but i dont unnerstand what happens in the movie. who are the people with the red guy? why didnt queen armadillo kill all the bad guys? she's a queen cuz she can do that stuff. i like annikan too cuz he looks like my brother and my brother say s he wants to pod race like annikan. i have this dvd and i like it but i don't pay attention to the movie. i like the people in it.
1,Does the DVD edition allow me to edit out Jar Jar?,"If one of the special extra on this DVD is the ability to edit out Jar-Jar, I will definitely buy it. Of course, it would be nice if I could also edit out Liam Neeson, and get my $ back that I wasted seeing it in the theatre."
1,Worst Episode Ever and Bad George Attitude!,"Everything was bad in this movie except of some Special effects, that will only look good on a DVD format, but since Goerge is Still suffering from his failare in marketing DIVX, he's just playing it straight mean! Oh Yeah and Eposide II will have Leonardo De'Caprio as the star,hmmm I see where george has totally lost his touch and how he is taking Star Wars glorie down the drain!"
3,"Well, I think I don't know what I think, y'know?","A random mishmash of good and bad. Varies from scene to scene, often within the scene. In honor of the movie's plot, I'll list the good and bad in short blurbs, paying little attention to style.THE GOOD: Special effects, settings, Ewan, Liam, Darth Maul, it is Star wars, Portman's cute, plenty of dvd extras, musical score, opening scroll, mercury ships, and Yoda.THE BAD: Jar Jar, Jake, ethnic allusions, teenagers flirting with pre-adolescents, plot, misplaced odes to droids, dialogue, kid's mother, queen's clothing, bumbling robots, pod race fiasco, miticlorions?, Jake, and Jar Jar.All this having been said, I've watched the DVD a dozen times and have disliked it fractionally less with each viewing. What does that mean to you? I have no idea, flip a coin, buy it or don't."
3,Now if only the Indiana Jones trilogy would come out on DVD.,"The movie itself is decent, albeit doesn't have quite the ""wow"" factor of the previous Star Wars movies. And maybe it's just me, but shouldn't ships from EARLIER in time look more primitive than movies from the original trilogy? I mean, the Naboo starfighters look very futuristic when compared to clunkers like the Y-Wing, which were developed LATER! I'll probably at least rent the DVD to see the special features."
4,Yes I hate Jar-Jar too,"But be fair the Movie was trying to play true on so many fans expectations, and take into accout what is almost it's own libary (Meaning hundreds of books comics short storys, ect.) of information about how things happened in the ""Star Wars"" world. Lucas has said he would not make the last 3 chapter of Luke's story because of this (Well the aging of the main charaters probibly dosn't help the chances...maybe a movie about the twins someday?).Any way The Phantom Menanc was well named what with Senitor Palpatine moving in the direction becoming Emperor Palpatine. I liked this one and can't wait to see the next. The movie looks a lot like what it is... A prequil to the story of Vader, Luke, and Lei. And even with Jar Jar was a lot of fun."
2,It's just not the same.,"It's been said before but I'll say it again. If Lucas had spent nearly as much time on story and character development as he did on computer generated whimsy, this may have been more up to par with the ""original"" trilogy. Hence, when I was working at my video store and they gave us the exciting news that ""Episode I"" was finally to make it's long-awaited arrival to DVD, my response was an overwhelming ""So?""Extra-features, commentaries, making-of's, all that jazz doesn't make up for the fact that this movie is a sure sign that somewhere between Jedi and Phantom, Lucas got a little too caught up in the business of keeping track of his royalties than keeping track of his imagination.Sure, standing alone, it's a decent picture (I still say Galaxy Quest was that year's best sci-fi release), but when held up next to it's three big brothers...well it's kinda like holding a Pokemon Pikachu wristwatch won from a crane game next to Big Ben."
2,"Not as good as Empire, but not BAD either.","I have loved Luke SKywalker since I was 11 years old, and I can say that this movie will never hold a place in my heart the way the original trilogy did. It seemed to me that George Lucas was trying to recreate his trilogy, and failing. However, there are some strong points: Ewan and Liam were wonderful, Darth Maul was a highly effective baddie, and Natalie Portman wasn't nearly as annoying as I thought she would be. Of course, there are some bad points as well: Jar Jar, Anakin, etc. I wouldn't recommend getting the DVD unless you REALLY love the movie or just want the ability to get the the good parts faster (why do you think I'm actually buying this thing?)"
4,Fairly enjoyable prequel,"While the original trilogy of Star Wars was better, this new prequel trilogy isn't bad, though this trilogy goes on for a LONG time all together and could have been pared down to two films. We see Anakin Skywalker as a young boy - almost hard to think that this is a prelude to the big, bad Darth Vader. I really liked Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala, and most of her costumes were awesome (though there were a couple of really awful ones) This first movie sets up the events in the second and third films."
1,If not for the lightsabers and Natalie Portman,"If not for the two above this movie would be a total waste of time and Portman is so so. Our good friend Lucas decide to flush the whole thing. The actor are so wooden i'd rather watch a kids play with the action figures. Hell, Frank Oz as yoda gives a better performance than all save darth maul. Speaking of which he is the only character that i would care to learn more about. Obi-wans okay, but to jaded to be so young.fortunately the final lightsaber battle rocks. however, it is short and lacks the whole feel of luke Vs. vader.bum it from a friend if possible.i'll go see the others just to see what they are like.don't waste money to rent or buy."
3,good but not as good....,"this movie is a good set up movie for the sequels, but not nearly as good as the first three films that came out."
1,This movie never should have been made.,"I was very surprised and dissapointed to see George Lucas single handedly destroy everything I loved about episodes 4 and 5. The storyline (not that spectacular in the other Star Wars films, but these two had a lot of other things that made them great films) is irrelevant and the Star Trek like technobabble is awfull (midichlorians, very very bad idea George, it takes everything magical out of the Force thus destroying the concept), the actors spout their lines on command without feeling and the characters are forgettable at best. Anyway I saw it a couple of times and stick with what I thought the first time I left the theater: ""This movie should never have been made""."
1,They blew it,"For anyone who has seen the other star wars movies, this movie was a huge disappointment. It felt more like a made for tv movie than the most anticipated Movie ever.I lost a lot of respect for George Lucas for using [poor] computer generated special effects instead of using miniatures as they had done in the past. He probably saw 'the matrix' and said, yea I can do that. But he could not.The plot was thin, the characters not even close to being engaging. Darth Maul (only exciting character) did not have enough presence to be anything close to Darth Vader.George please let someone else direct the next episodes. Don't let your ego destroy this legacy."
2,An Okay movie,"Already over 2,000 reviews on this thing so far. That's amazing, but even more amazing was how uninspiring this film was. The city planet was a strange place, and it reminded of all the trips to Boston on Rte 128 or Rte 495. I can't imagine a planet that reminds me of New York City. That was a truly disturbing vision. Then there were the Jedi's. Not too inspiring, either. The villains were preposterous, as was the alleged UN of the planets. Just the same kind of stuff as in the year 2002. Boring, boring, and politically boring. Ja-Ja Binks was the real winner, here, and I'm not getting into the racist dialogue. He had nothing to do with being a Jamaican, no matter what anyone says. He was a unique character, and his city under the sea was truly inspiring. The rest of the movie was a set-up for the next. Typical Lucas fare."
2,AverageGuy,"I'm just an average guy watching a movie. And this is my opinion: I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!The story wasn't interesting (or fulfilling). There was no attachment or connection with any characters. In some cases, they were just annoying: Jar Jar Binks. They should have just cut this guy out completely. The special effects were great but, again, this film relied too much on it. I liked the older FX: animatronics and models. The characters seemed more appealing and believable. I hope they do a better job with the next film."
1,BAD BAD and MORE BAD,"Just flat out bad, bad bad. I've been waiting for the next set of movies since 1983 and boy did this fall on its' face. Growing up with the original three movies I always hoped that GL would finish up the story-but this outing failed horribly. If you want it, wait for the dvd boxed set that will eventually be released after the EP III is released. Bad....bad....bad....."
2,not as good as I thought it would be,"Too much kidstuff. Lucas lost his edge with this one. Special effects are cool, but a little too much for me. Jar-Jar was annoying, the kid is annoying, the race scene was cheesy. I could go on, but I won't."
3,Poor Characterization is a Great Spoil-All,The movie looks fine until this Jar-Jar Binks character shows up. The stupidity of this character completely turns me off. It makes the whole movie childish. More logical that such a character dies in battle. Should rename him as Jar-Jar Jinx.Wonder what Lucas saw in JJB. Let's hope we don't see any such character in future episodes or it will be another waste of time and money.
1,What were they thinking?,"Right after when I saw this movie I wish it would never been made. This is the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. It seemed more like a kids movie to me. The other Star Wars trilogy is much more better than this and I wish that Episode IV would be Episode I, Episode V would be Episode II, and Episode VI would be Episode III (the last episode). What's the point of starting it as Star Wars - Episode IV that is ridiculous. I didn't really like the way that they did that and I hope when I see Episode II next year it would be a lot more better than Phantom Menace. If not I would really be disappointed at George Lucas. Anyways if you hadn't seen The Phantom Menace don't you will not like it stick with the original trilogy."
1,EP1 [is bad] no matter how much stuff they put on the DVD,"I watched the first time in absolute horror. Then I went back to see it, a second time, and give it a fair shake, sorry. I couldn't stand it the 2nd time either (digitally projected no less)There is nothing remotely satifying in The Phantom Menace. Everyone talks about the stupid pod race like it the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's ok, but let's not get crazy about it.I tried to watch it a 3rd time but shut it off. The acting is terrible!! Jake Lloyd is awful, awful, awful. I see fair attempts with Natalie Portman's character and the Emperor, but the performances are somewhat shallow feeling."
1,George Lucas = Fat Elvis,When Elvis got fat nobody cared because he used to be ELVIS. When Georgle Lucas's movies began to suck nobody cared because he used to be GEORGE LUCAS. As long as lucas has something to do with Star Wars sequels they will all suck.
3,At last we shall reveal ourselves to the Jedi...,"I must admit the first time I saw the movie I was so hyped up with anticipation that all the movie could do was leave me with a feeling of disappointment. I am an avid follower of Star Wars and followed every move of the pre-production notes. I decided to see the movie a second time and enjoyed the film much more so than the first time. Watch it once and you miss a lot because things move so fast. Watch it for a second or third time and you begin to love it. Despite the lack of character development of Qui-Gon and Obi Wan, it definetely lives up to the Star Wars name. The only reason I give this movie 3-stars instead of 4 or 5 is because of Anakin. Put in a kid as the focus of a movie and you usually end up disappointed by their lack of acting skills. Episode II should prove much better - the kid is grown up and you can focus more on the Dark Side. Just please don't ruin part II by casting Leonardo DiCaprio."
1,Where was Billy Dee Williams?,"THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE. i am not even going to touch on jarjar. george lucas went out of his way to introduce ever stupidcharacter, however he forgot to introduce the best character...Lando Calrissian."
3,3 Stars?!?! I'll tell you why...,"For the 1st installment of the Star Wars silver screen story, it was pretty damn good. So why 3 stars? First, Jar-Jar. I hate Jar-Jar with a burning salty passion. Second, I hate that kid who plays Anakin. Third, the pod race was a bit too long for my taste. After a while, it made me seem as though lucas didn't have enough material for the movie, so he pumped the movie with pod racing. Other than that, I gotta wait for the Attack of the Clones!!"
4,It could have more....,This is the first DVD of the greatest saga in the movies history (along with the Godfather). I think this DVD should have ALL the options they could add. For example... Why to include only spanish dub version? Everybody likes to see the movie in its original languaje.... SUBTILES!!!.... we wanted SUBTILES.....They cold also give us an ULTIMATE EDITION... with all the deleted scenes included in the movie.... like the Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition... what a cool DVD!!...I think they have to make their homework for the next DVD releases....
1,Mirror Image,"I think George made Watto a little like himself.""Great storyline, superb acting, tastefull humor, and delightful characters don't work on me....only money!"""
4,The Phantom Menace,"I seen this in theatres in 1999. In any case, I believe it to be a good movie, even if it wasn't as good as the original trilogy. The graphics are better in this movie than the originals, but what are you to expect with the time difference? The Pod race was awesome too. Jake Lloyd (the kid who played Anakin) cannot act to save his life, therefore the film suffers with the scenes he's in.Here's the biggest problems: How do you have better technology in the past then you do in the future? If I remember right, Episode I takes place at least 30 years before Episode IV. Why do you have an animal pulling something that can levitate, they can figure out how to levitate something but they can't figure out how to move it from point A to point B? George Lucas has such a big ego that he had to showoff how great he is and make this movie so over the top with special effects that it makes the originals look dated instead of making the new movies flow into the old movies."
5,A worthy entry in the greatest film series of all time!,"The film is not perfect, obviously. But the backlash against it has been unfair to say the least. Aside from the acting of young Jake Lloyd, the film is hugely entertaining, gorgeous to look at, and is just as mythical and deep as the original trilogy. Don't just jump on the bandwagon and mindlessly criticize it like many people have done (especially critics). Give it an honest assessment, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,Gets better with age.,"I think that once George Lucas has completed the Star Wars saga we will look upon this film more sympathetically. It was savaged on release for its awful script and wooden acting, and that will still remain true, but it will be seen more and more important in relation to the whole saga. It is merely an introduction, and at the time, critics and fans alike were dissaponted because nothing was new."
4,Where is the action at????,"Rule one need more action in the movie. And rule two well, not rule two sorry. (Liam Neeson) and (Ewan McGregor) are great. I think the moive will be better on DVD that's what I think? Because some of the moive is cut out because there is not alot of tape for at all.Well, the moive did't do so well the with other view's. But not with me. I think it can do more better than that?? I think (George Lucas) can do better than that because I have seen some of his moives.I mean it's a great moive and all but the fan's did't like it at all. So if you like it alright it not that's ok too. HEY! neverbody can't better good at all the time you know.I hope you enjoy it and I like to hear form you soon. Ok.Thank you for reading this and please vote careful."
2,Not Star Wars Material,"This movie is good but it does not live up to the Star Wars standard. I believe Lucas has become too interested in money instead of quality. It is an entertaining movie, but should have the Star Wars title on it"
4,Good but lacks something,"THIS MOVIE IS UNDOUBTEDLY A VERY GOOD ONE. HOWEVER NOT AS IMPACTIBLE AS THE FIRST ONES. ONE THING THAT REALLY KILLED THE MOVIE WAS JAR JAR BINKS. THAT CHARACTER JUST WAS NOT NEEDED. ONE COMPARISON BETWEEN THIS FILM AND THE FIRST ONES IS THE CHARACTERS. THE OLD MOVIES WERE MORE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE THAT THE CHARACTERS CREATED IS VERY INTERESTING. HUMANS WOULD DRESS UP IN VERY GOOD COSTUMES AND DARTH VADAR HAD AN EFFECT THAT WAS VERY GOOD: THE MYSTERY, MASK, AND BREATH. NOW IN THIS MOVIE, GEORGE LUCAS SEEMS TO RELY ON SPECIAL EFFECTS TO DO EVERYTHING. HE DIDN'T SEEM TO CREATE SOME KIND OF INTELLIGENCE ON THE SCREEN. THE RELIABILITY ON SPECIAL EFFECTS SEEMED TO BE VERY DULL. HOWEVER, THE VILLIAN DARTH MAUL WAS VERY GOOD. THE EVIL THAT HIS FACE CREATED WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS DARTH VADAR. THIS MOVIE SEEMED TO LACK THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THE FIRST TRILOGY HAD. I WOULD HOWEVER HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF THE FIGHT SCENES AND RACING SCENE, AND MANY OTHERS."
2,Fun for everyone....,"This movie is a good time.....that is if you and all your friends sit around cheering and hoping that the movie can some how re-script itself and Jar-Jar buys the farm, slowly. It can rate only 2 stars at best only for the fact it bares the Star Wars name, and it has Darth Maul. Other than that this was G. Lucas's way of saying look what i can do with my new software. This mistake can only be erased, well it can never be erased, but hopefully he will redeem himself in the 2nd episode. George, some really good plot twists have to happen in then next 2 movies to tie it all in... a lot of potential lies here....PLEASE don't screw it up!"
3,"George Lucas, you gotta be kidding","I guess it was inevitable... after all the hype, the movie had to be a letdown, but this much of a letdown? What ""The Phantom Menace"" adds up to is a banal script, some really dreadful dialogue, some idiotic characters (somebody lock up Jar-Jar and throw away the key), and some dazzling, stupendous special effects. The second installment should be a lot more promising when we find out when and how young Anakin Skywalker took the initial wrong turn that ultimately transformed him into Darth Vader; that movie may have some real juice to it. For now, Lucas and Co. need to realize that it takes considerably more than awesome special effects to make a good movie."
4,More than meets the eye. . .,"The first time is saw The Phantom Menace, I was honestly disappointed. The other three movies seemed to be on a far more galactic scale. Yet, on subsequent viewings of the movie, I gradually realized just how many subtle ideas and foreshadowing events Lucas is planning. This is the beginning of a far greater and wide reaching epic. I loved it!"
2,someone please kill off JarJar Binks!,"Episode 1 is the ""best"" of the three prequel movies - but they totally ruined an otherwise decent movie with JarJar Binks. Worst character ever. I try to put this movie on for my 2yo and she SCREAMS ""nooooo! I want STAR WARS! NOT THAT!"" which of course makes me laugh. She's a purist just like mommy. :-)"
3,Too many characters....little plot,"Ok, I gave it 3 stars because I was thrilled with the Pod Racing section. Other than that, it is completely empty. If anyone ever heard people complain about Mortal Kombat: the movie, then you got the picture. It seems like them tried to add too many characters into the movie and it turns out, they didn't have enought time to developed the characters into the story itself. This is the first time watching SW and I wish that the darkside should win."
5,Movie of the Year,"I saw the first three when i was only 2 and loved it. ""I have a bad feeling about this"" is what obi wan said and it was what i said when i found out about the prequale i was scared it was going to ruin it. When i saw it i was happly surprised it was great. The best begining to a great series. If you missed it in the theater heres the next best thing."
1,May the crud be with you!,"A multi million dollar answer to The Blair Witch rip-off! God help us all if this is the way of the future for the cinema. I'd talk about its faults, but there are just too many. You'll not get one more cent out of me George!"
4,"HEY, COME ON!","HEY, COME ON! THE MOVIE WAS'NT THAT BAD. I MEAN THE MOVIE WAS'NT THE BEST OUTTA THE SEIRES BUT IT DID SET IT UP. I DOTHINK THAT KID LOOKED WAY TOO CUTE TO BE VADER. AN IF THEY PICK LEO FOR 2 THEN IT WILL FIT THE CHILD BUT STILL TOO CUTE I THINK. AN WHAT ABOUT THEM F/X'S? WoW! AN WHAT ABOUT DARTH MAUL? THIS SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY OE THAT HE WILL BE IN. WAS HE NOT KICK A$$ OR WHAT? I THINK HE WAS THE KOOLEST EVER. BUT NOT BETTER THEN VADER. I DO THINK HE LOOKED KOOLER THEN VADER THO. WAS THE FIGHTING IN IT NOT THE BEST IN ANY STAR WARS? I MUST SAY I HOPE JAR JAR DIES AN FAST. I DONOT WANT HIM TO RETURN. HE MESSED UP THE MOVIE BUT THE MOVIE IS'NT BAD."
1,Die Monster Die!,"Facing the sky and waiving my fists wildly I scream, ""Cuuuuuuuurrrrrrrssssse you George Lucas!"""
2,Fell short of expectations,"I could not believe how weak this movie turned out to be after the enormous amount of hype surrounding its release. So many different areas should have been focused on instead of the ones that were. I am now totally unexcited for episode 2 to come out. I am much, MUCH more excited to see the Matrix 2, to tell the truth. And why has it taken so long to release a DVD of this movie? Where are the DVDs for the other episodes? WHERE, Mr. Lucas?!?!?!"
2,Episode II: Electric Boogaloo,"All I know after watching this film five dozen times is that Jar Jar is a clumsy Gungan with a knack for finding troubles...or do troubles find him? Truly, Jar Jar is the existential everygungan, whose bumbling and occasional stumbling irritated and offended audiences everywhere. Especially given the ""Clones"" title for Episode II, I am forced to conclude that Lucas has totally lost it and that his time would be better spent adding CGI footage to ""Howard the Duck."" Nice one, George. ..."
1,Not good enough.,"This new star wars episode, while showing great photography, special effects, and innovative cinematic techniques, misses what the original series had - a good story, mystery, and as others put it, a sense of humor and that 'spark'. Although it is worth seeing (although I don't know, it somehow can ruin one's impression of the originals), it definitely doesn't seem destined to be the classics of its predecessors."
2,Great special effects do not a great movie make...,"You can be dazzled with all of the state-of-the-art technology in the world and still come up feeling short-changed, especially in the emotion department. Everyone has talked this film to death, but what I don't get is that there is nothing that draws you to the film emotionally like the first trilogy. And what's the deal with Liam Neeson's departure and then the next scene there's cheering and a big celebration? Hollow and flat. None of the exhilarating happiness of the earlier films. Just bloated with self-importance. I'm sure Episode II will be better..."
1,More imagination than a dial tone,"this movie was dull, flat, tedious, unimaginative, badly acted, and just not entertaining. You have to be a serious Star Wars fan to like this..I mean it was awful..I recently have seen an interview with george lucas from the 1980's in which he stated (at the making of The Empire Strikes Back) that his heart was gone out of this trilogy , he just wanted to get it over with and the only reason he is making the next 2 films is because he promised they would be made..and it showed The Empire strikes Back is so cheesy and plastic I find it comical..so why did he make this movie 20 years later? For commercial reasons, his heart isn't in it and sorry folks George Lucas is not an imaginative person, well maybe as imaginative as Dr. Suess...please"
1,the worst movie ever made,well actually I give this a -1 I mean how can anybody like this. Sure qui gon was good but JarJar was THE WORST THING TO EVER BE ON STAR WARS!!!!!!!!! If you haven't seen it he talks like this (meso stupid).Obi wan is Ok I only liked Mauls lightsaber there was no point to the pod race Aniken dosen't do anything until the next 2 movies no action to it exept when Obi wan fights Maul.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Annoying,"I tyhink this is a bit ridiculous. Ankin was goiod, then bad, then MORE bad, then all the way good in the last 50 seconds of his life. The orginals were pretty good, and this movies puts them to shame."
1,Eye Surgery,"You people give out high ratings too easily. This was not a good movie by any standards other than special effects. I can't even bring myself to like those, because they created Jar-Jar Binks. I own this DVD, and it gets worse every time I watch it.The main problem with this movie is Anikin. Not only was he a bad actor, but his lines were a hideous attempt at trying to simulate a kid talking. Thus, for several scenes he stays in his really serious ""I want to be a Jedi and free all the slaves"" additude, and then the lucasarts people realize ""Hey! he's supposed to be a child!"" And then he suddenly starts bouncing around saying ""yipeee!"" Anikin is what finally ruined the pod-race scene.Bad movie aside, the DVD is poorly designed. All the menus are separated by unskippable 30-second long transitions that turn an already unpleasant movie experience into something not worth the excuse to eat popcorn. Don't waste your time here."
3,Just vanilla,"The movie itself was actually pretty good, but when held to the same standards as the original three Star Wars movies it lacked the same oomph. Lucas himself, admitted that he was a little rusty in the Star Wars universe and it showed in some of the choices for the movie. Jar-Jar Binks. That said it is still a decent movie and a definite must buy, if only to eventually own all of the series."
3,Dissapointing DVD - Lucas should do better,"I was eagerly waiting for this DVD, expecting a crystal sharp picture and a dynamic Dolby 5.1 EX soundtrack, after all, Lucas delayed the DVD release so that he could personally supervize its production.I was dissapointed.......Picture quality was washed out, and black level was more grey than black. Many scenes exhibited edge enhancementSound mix was not the best I've heard, and the dialog level was very low compared to the other channels.Probably looks good on a regular TV, but on my 90 inch screen and THX sound system, it was so so.Still enjoyed watching it though. Lets hope the other episodes are an improvement in quality"
4,it could have been better,It could have been a better movie. I had expected more of a good movie to kick of the series but it is still ok. One complaint. The kid who played anikan STUNK. He had no emotion when reading his lines. My favorite scene is when all of these droids are about to kill him he is WHINING with R2-D2. Although i am glad they added R2-D2 in the first movie becsue that little guy is awsome. My recomandation is to buy it.
2,Episode 1 is a huge disappointment,"With the way Episode 1 went, I can only hope Lucas gets his act together for Episode 2, because this film was a disaster. True, the special effects were stunning, especially the underwater giant fish, but special effects don't make a movie good. There are so many things wrong with this movie, such as:a)Young Skywalker manages to destroy the bulk of an orbiting space station by ""luck"". b)There is no Hans Solo c)Jar-Jar Binks is an idiot, and completely ruins what was left of the film.d)Not enough Samuel L. Jackson or Yoda e)The plot was fairly basicIn conclsion, buy the first three Star Wars films, they were amazing, while this was far from it."
3,Mmmmmm.....,"Well this isn't as good as it should be. The plot is alittle on it's down side, and so is the charactors. Anikans character was alittle to in to it and he acted like a show of and all. I could even make this movie better than it is..... But, Obe one Kenobe's actor was great!, and so is the graphics but:wheres ep. 2?"
3,review on Amazon service,"I've bought this as a gift for my friend's kid. I have no idea how the kid liked it.However, the service I've received from Amazon was excellent."
1,racist and boring,"What was Lucas thinking, or was he thinking!!! I can't believe I kept looking at my watch to see how much more I had to endure. Is this really a Star Wars episode?! If boring wasn't enough... what's with the overt rascism in the characters... is this really a Star Wars episode?! George, are you still doing acid or are you just having flashbacks?If no stars was an option that what I would have rated this film!!!!!!!!"
1,Even Star Trek is Better than this!,"I have a bad feeling about this,"" says the young Obi-Wan Kenobi perfectly summorizing the collective thought of the audience."
3,Short on audio Quality,"I am dismayed that the DVD release does not offer the DTS encoding. As what usually happens, they release the Dolby 5.1 and then later the DTS trying to sell you the same product twice. I have waited this long for the DVD. I guess I can wait a little longer for the DTS version. Bummer..."
1,Watch jet Li's movie.,"I expected a lot from the Starwars, but I was really disppointed. Jet Li's movies are much better than this stupid movie. Story line is good, but the action scenes are rediculous. Learn from Jet Li. Watch Fist of Legend or Swordsman 2. You will get 10 times more fun from those movies. Starwar? I think it's a kids' war."
4,Hmm,"I'm rating the DVD as well as the film itself. The movie plain and simple, is not good. It stinks. It was an astonishing visual achievment, but the writing, well..... was pathetic. Its like watching a really elaborate video game. Except video games have better plots, and characters. I found both the childrens performances to be a little wooden, but given the dialogue, who can blame them? Everyone else plods along gamely enough, and the whole thing seems to work on a ; buy these toys at your local kay bee level. I was rather dissapointed.The DVD itself is pretty good. Several deleted scenes fully completed , special effects and all. The sound on the DVD is some of the best you will find and if your good home theatre system and are a fan you'll enjoy this DVD."
5,Great film.,"It's Star Wars, what can I say? It's an astounding stepping stone for an incredible story. This was just the setup the pay off is coming. It changes Star Wars forever in the best possible way. Highest recommendation to those not caught up in how they think Star Wars should be."
2,HIGH EXPECTATIONS NOT CAUSE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT.........,"I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and even though I give THE PHANTOM MENACE only two stars....I do it for good reason.My opinion of PHANTOM MENACE is quite simply explained. The original Star Wars looked real!!! It looked real because it was real!! Models and sets. That was the beauty of it!PHANTOM MENANCE, it seemed, was written in a manner to suit the computer effects they could do. Many of the scenes served absolutely zero purpose, other than to show off the computer CGI JUNK. Which, quite frankly, didn't transport the audience to a GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY, but instead into George Lucas' computer.The other thing that ruined the movie for me, was the way they chopped up the final battle. Cutting back and forth between the battle in the field and the lightsabre battle sucked the intensity, suspense and excitement right out of it. Leaving me going... humph, instead of WOW!!It's a bad movie. It's a cool movie, but it's a bad one...."
2,Spectacular Snooze,"The DVD is the first time I've seen this movie. Honestly, I fell asleep. This is not the sign of a good film. I keep hearing about how great the extras on the 2nd disk are but, who cares when the movie was this dull? Why would I want to see them? I think part of the problem was Lucas and team tried too hard to keep everyone happy and, in doing so, made no one happy. I would willingly pass on special effects and odd-looking aliens if I could get a bit of story."
2,A disappointing film in a disappointing format,"Nowhere near as good as the original trilogy, The Phantom Menace is only about special effects. The ""force"" stuff gets too weird, maybe even blasphemous. Jar Jar and others are obvious racial stereotypes which some will find offensive. The only reason to buy this movie is so you can enjoy the state-of-the-art *digital* effects at home. However, you cannot enjoy them in the inferior and outdated VHS format. Wait for the DVD."
1,It's gonna be great,"It's stylistically designed to be that way, and you can't undo that, but you can diminish the effects of it."
1,An unnatural experience!,"Most of the time . . . I despise sequels! This film is the first and terrible anyway! I like the following five, and George Lucas didn't even direct the final two motion pictures. I'm amazed that they were even made. But luck was with us, for they are better . . ."
1,PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE IS DE-THRONED!,"I never thought it would happen, but it did! It IS possible to make a movie WORSE than ""PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE"" and this scumbag of a movie is it! Star Wars 1 is flawed, horrendously (who in God's name hired Jake Lloyd for an actor???) acted, abominally written and cheesy and corny to no end! The special effects STINK and the story (not that there really is one) is so stupid it's funny! STAR WARS EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE should be featured in a book entitled: HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE! Good bye."
1,A New Beginning...Or Not.,"There's a irony here, that the man who started the mythos of Star Wars becomes the director who so carelessly destroys it. Does this DVD set new standards? Sure it does. It has A LOT of interesting extras such as computer generated deleted scenes and some very intriguing behind the scenes features. But does this save the movie? Hell no. The original movies like 4,5, and 6 had some great dialouge. While the Phantom Menace has some really interesting characters, its painful to listen to them speak. I'm sure I will get a lot of negative reactions from this review, but Star Wars fans have to ask themselves this...did you actually have fun watching this movie?"
5,"Great Movie, Great DVD","I loved this movie, and I am a HUGE star wars fan. Some of the acting was not really strong (but that is not what the sw films are known for), but that did not detract from the beautiful panoramic shots, the development of the Queen's story line, and the setting for the next films. I sometimes even think this is my favorite one of the series."
2,I'm convinced that George Lucas is a buffoon,"George, George, George. It's been 22 years can't you think of a way to end a movie other than having a little ship fly into a big ship, blow it up, and save the day. Luke Skywalker took his little ol' X-Wing and dropped two bombs into an exhaust port. OK that worked in 1977.Return of the Jedi sees Lando attack yet another Death Star. This time flying into it and blowing it up. OK well see my review for that movie.Now in 1999 Anakin Skywalker flys a fighter into a mother ship, this time lands, and starts shooting the place up and flies out?How will Star Wars II end? I have a prediction. A little ship will fly into a big ship and blow it up.Biggest disappointment since the Star Wars Holiday special."
3,MAN!!! This is NOT what I expected...,"C'mon George!! What happened?? The first three were of course, great. But Episode I was just Ok. I had waited a really long time for this one to come out, and I was somewhat disapointed. Better luck in the next movies."
2,RedLetterMedia got everything right...,But I didn't need them to know that Phantom Menace blows.This movie is barely more than a glossy reissue of the Star Wars merchandising line.Go to YouTube. Watch the review. You'll enjoy it more than you will Phantom Menace.
1,What was Lucas thinking???,"This was a terrible movie! After giving us one of the best trilogies in movie history, Lucas does this??? Confused plot, repulsive characters (especially Jar Jar), and ...did anyone REALLY want to see a baby-faced Darth Vader shouting ""Yippee!"" Barf! It sort of ruined the whole second trilogy for me. (Although the second trilogy does get better from here!) I know Lucas was trying to draw in pre-schoolers who had never seen the first trilogy, but did he need to thumb his nose at his older fan base?If Lucas really cared for his fans he would come out with his own re-edit of this one (sort of like the newer version of the original series) giving us a movie that is watchable for ""over pre-school"" fans. Or at least, instead of trying the sue the phantom editor, he could have included the phantom edit as a special feature on the DVD as a tribute to his fans who loved his work enough to try to cover his mistakes!"
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"Of all the many Binks in the world, who is the most skull-crushingly annoying? Is it the Binks Company, the Canadian insurance brokers? Is it the U.S. manufacturers of spray guns, paint booths, and electrostatic spray equipment? Or is Jar Jar, the mouthy horse-lizard from the 4th Star Wars movie, appropriately titled Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace? If you said anything but number three, you are imprisonably insane! That's right, Mike Nelson and Kevin Murphy take on the franchise-ruining Star Wars that everybody loves to hate but nobody loves to watch! Only we make you want to watch it again, and laugh instead of kill! Finally, Jar Jar gets what he deserves!"
2,Slow and not mutch happened,I really like star wars but dont get me wrong but this movie was not very good for a star wars movie and it overall turned me off to star wars. This movie had too mutch Jar Jar who was very Idiotic and the technology seemed newer then the origonal trigoly but episode 2 dose a great job fixing the errors of episode 1. The special effects and the actress that pays the queen is all this movie had going for it. Personally I liked the origonal trilogy and episode 2 alot better. Because episode 2 was mutch better then episode one and 2 is just as good as the origonal is why I like it better.
2,The movie itself gets 1 star but the DVD has great features.,"I am a big Star Wars fan. I loved the first three movies, and I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. The whole thing felt forced and disjointed with the known Star Wars universe... just a flashy showing of digital effects. But worst of all is the child actor - and I use the term loosely - playing Anakin. His utter inability to emote even a quasi-convincing whoop of joyous victory overshadows any annoyance I may have felt at the infamous Jar-Jar or the cheap army of Binks clones for the last battle scene.All that being said, this DVD has some great extras that makes it worth getting even if you're a Star Wars fan that wants to smack George Lucas with a newspaper for disappointing you with this bewilderingly shallow-even-for-a-Star-Wars-flick movie."
3,"Mostly a good DVD, but some gripes","Ok, the weaknesses of Phantom Menace are well known, so I won't go into pointing out the weaknesses in it. The DVD has some really nice features, particularly alot of the bonus material that was added. Still, some of the menus are so filled with flash that it slows down getting to what you want to see (For example rather than give you a good decent list of the deleted scenes, you have to view the name of the scenes one at a time). My biggest gripe is the fact that Lucas changed the film on the DVD so that it is different than the one on VHS or appeared in the theater. While the additional scenes were nice, a DVD that does not explicitly name itself as a director's cut should at least give the viewer the option to see the film the way it was originally presented (for an example of how that is done very effectively see the Abyss DVD, while I much prefer the Director's Cut, it is nice to be able to see the original)."
2,No heart and no soul,"Well, after only 1,800+ reviews, I figured I would add my two cents worth. Enough about Jar Jar, we all hated him, end of story. The real problem with this movie is that Lucas has forgotten what gives a movie value and entrances the watcher. There simply was nothing to pull you in, to make you feel like you are watching some great epic struggle. This is what the first two movies had (and somewhat the third movie). Nobody cares about CGI generated tadpoles fighting CGI generated robots! ""Gee wiz the special effects are great, but do I really care what happens to either side being depicted?"" Um, no. Please, Mr. Lucas, go back and watch the first two movies of your own series and try to recreate the magic.Now, as for whether you should purchase this DVD or not? Yes, but skip to the Jedi lightsaber battle scenes. This is the best thing about a DVD--it's way easier to do this than with tape!"
4,MANY FLAWS BUT GOOD ANYWAY,Personally I think there has never been a better movie but as it went along I saw many flaws. 1. How could Anikan build C-3PO if Cybot Galactica were the ones that designed him. 2. How can they mesuer the Midichlorins if the FORCE is all around. 3. Why didn't Darth Malue screm when Obi-Wan sliced in half. Even though he was instantly dead he would have felt something. 4. Why didn't Qui-Gon die instanly. 5. Why don't more Jedi members speak. 6. Last I herd R2 didn't have any thing to make him stay on a ship especally when it went to hyperspace. As soon as I can think of more flaws thats all I have to say.
2,Total Pish,"When I went to see the movie, I had high expectations. I hadenjoyed the first three films and thought this would be as good. I wassadly disapointed. The only good thing in the whole movie was the pod racing scene. It had better effects, but lacked the same plot, suspence and character that the three older films had."
5,Star Wars Episode I,"I loved this movie. Lucas does a great job getting us involved with these characters just like he did with 4,5 and 6. Can't wait for the next one to come out."
2,"Its for children, really.","'The Phantom Mence' was one of the few movies I fell asleep to in the theaters. The character development is sloppy and the story is not really interesting. No doubt, it is for children. If you think otherwise, maybe you should have your head examined. ZZZ....ZZZZ"
2,I should have watched Independence Day,"If special effects could save a film this might have been interesting. The music, cinematography, and scenery are all excellent. Unfortunately the young Jake Lloyd ""Anakin Skywalker"" is no Haley Joel Osment. He has the look but no substance, I couldn't wait for him to get off the screen. Jar Jar... needed to be reigned in a bit. I was expecting a lot from this movie. The story is very weak and this was a waste of a good cast. I doubt if I will play the DVD more than once."
2,Star Wars Episode 1 - The Fuzzy Menace,The Prologic Sound Track is very good. I wish I could say the same for the video quaility. The colors are washed out and the picture is grainy. It's below average when compared to other video tapes. The ending credits are so fuzzy it's difficult to read them.I should have held off for the DVD. This wasn't worth it. :(
3,A little greed is worse than Jar-Jar,"I am a huge fan of the original Starwars and was wondering how Lucasfilm was going to pull this off. To try and go back to the begining and give a begining to an established film was a tall order. Not wanting to raise or lower my expectations, I didn't watch any of the previews for the movie. I think the film was an outstanding work and helped set the stage for the next few films. Jar-Jar was bad, but not releasing the film in DVD was worse. I would love to own the film, but will have to pass. I will not buy this VHS format and turn around and buy the same movie in a year or two like the original ""Special Edition's"". A lot of us have been waiting for a long time for this release, imagine our dismay to only find VHS. Bad move George."
3,Wanted more.,"It was a great film. But I didn't like Jar-Jar, wanted more Maul, didn't understand the battle with the Trade Federation. And I wanted more from Anakin. To me he didn't seem very deep. He just seemed like a dumb kid along for the ride. Kind of like whiny little Luke in episode four. I had the feel of the original trilogy that it was like an actual event. I was watching the history of some other universe. It's kinda hard to explain. That was its appeal with me. I don't get that same kind of connection with this movie."
4,"MEDICHLORIANS, CHOSENONES SABER DUELS O MY!","Ok. Lucas had a brain cramp when he created the medichlorians none sense. And what is this about ""The chosen One""? But this is a very good movie!The purpose of this movie was to introduce us to Lukes parents and the Jedi temple as it existed during the Republic. It also introduces us Darth Sidious - Palpatine - The Evil Emperor.The music is chillingly outstanding. The door opens with Maul standing there and John Williams song ""duel of the Fates"" starts. What a moment in movie history. Then we are treated to an incredible, high energy light saber duel like nothing ever seen on screen.Yes there are dumb things to criticize. An elected Queen-ruler of a planet who is 16 years old? Darth Vader didn't recognize R2D2 or C3PO. Jar Jar isn't so bad... he spakes!"
4,A generally well-done prequel to the ongoing saga,"George Lucas' vision is another step complete with this excellent saga. Though not a heavy duty sci-fi nut, I do own all the Star Wars videos, in cluding this one. My recommendation is for this widescreen edition, so that none of the spectacular scenes and effects are lost. This film is kept from a 5 star rating simply by the kid-appeal accent on the silly Jar-Jar character, which adds too much slapstick to an otherwise extraordinary sci-fi entry. The widescreen presen tation is especially effective in the panoramic shots, the intense laser sabre fights, and the near-legendary pod race. Should one view the latter scene in pan-n-scan, the quick action and editing would prove too claustrophobic. This film is well worth the limited edition purchase price. Featuring a ""making of"" documentary of appx. 20 minutes preceding the main show."
3,STAR WARS NEEDS TO ENTER THE 21ST CENTURY,"I think the movie was good, I did notice the acting was bad in parts, and it was very slow for about the first hour. I was used to the old Star Wars where it was almost not stop action from the opening credits till the end of the movie. I will say this though. The first trilogy was filled with action because it was about the war between the empire and the rebbels, and now we are seeing the earlier story before the war had started. The special effects were outstanding I think George was snubed at the Oscars. But about the title of this post... I can't beleive that we will have to wait to see this on DVD. I think that for a Director like George Lucas who created THX and wants his movies to look the best that they can, would have released Star Wars on DVD sooner. But I guess it is all about money. I thought the video and audio quality on VHS was very poor."
2,Only Buy This If You NEED To Own It,"Everyone out there is well aware of the content of this moviealready so I will focus on the tape itself. Neither the Pan and Scannor the Widescreen is very good. The sound isn't too bad surprisingly enough, but the picture is terrible. The special effects are totally wasted on VHS as the colors are so washed out and the picture is fuzzy. Being a recent convert to DVD this is even more painful to watch. If you LOVE the movie and can tolerate its flaws at least buy the unbutchered Widescreen version. George Lucas is pushing off low quality on the consumer, what about those that just want a basic Widescreen VHS and have to pay for some cheap book and film strip? Don't waste your money if possible, wait for a DVD release."
2,Star Wars is not what it used to be!,"What the heck is this? The entire movie is based on special effects. No story, nothing really interesting, and the movie doesn't even look like Star Wars. The sword fight is really the only good scene with maybe the podrace, which is quite weird. I frankly miss the fun I had watching the first movies. Where's Han, Chewie, and C3PO looks really dumb. And that ugly frog guy, Jar Jar Binks, seems to take C3PO's part. He is the funny guy(?). He's funny but after a while he gets reaaaally boring. It seems that the movie and its story went back to some modern dark ages. If you have to take a movie tonight skip this one for the next century. It might look something like this boring movie. Small kids would like that, not grown-ups!"
2,Less than I'd except!,I'm suprised at this movie. I was realy cheesed off. I thought this would be some great scifi drama like the last 3. You could call this a kids movie practicly. In the movie the good guys will only nuetrilise threats if they our non living. Naboo all they talk about is we must realy on negotioations. Even when the power is out. There was no siege at all they didn't even go down figting on there own. It reminds reminds me of the halacust. They dont't even pick up a laser until the Jedis come.
3,DVD,"I think the DVD will make up for the bad quality of the movie. I have a feeling that the next movie will be better than EP1. Someone said why not have it on DTS, I don't think this would be a good idea as for the low take up on DTS compared to DD5.1. But a separate DVD for DTS users would be a good idea. I myself am looking forward to it, and have read a strong rumor that a TRAILER FOR EP2 may be on it!Thanks Mark"
4,"Good fun, but not a brilliant film","Star Wars 1, The Phantom Menace, is basically a comic book in film form. As simple as that. So if you would enjoy an entertaining sci-fi/fantasy film, then maybe you should buy this movie, but if you're the more synical filmwatcher and are expecting Shakespeare, then I would not recommend you buying this."
2,BoRiNg,I didn't really like this movie. There wasn't much action though I did like the pod-racing. The characters were cool but kinda corny. I fall asleep every time I watch this movie. I suggest buying the first three before this one because they were good. I saw the special edition in the movie theater and loved it but when I saw this one I liked it but got bored.
5,A great set-up film,"As a HUGE Star Wars fan, I must admit I spent the months before this movie came out aching in suspense and anticipation, and when I finally got to see it opening night, after all those months of waiting...I wasn't disappointed. True, Jar-Jar is pretty annoying, and the characters lack some of the flair and humor that made us love the original trilogy characters, this is still a worthwhile movie! I think it did an excellent job of setting up the next two movies--that's why the plot can seem drawn out, Lucas is giving us the whole picture of what is going on for the next two movies. In any case, the last twenty minutes of this movie are amazing, they really show what the action will be like in the next two, which I can hardly wait for!"
3,"Interesting philosophies, not a great movie","I guess I'm not a Star Wars geek. I enjoyed the original 3, but I didn't like this one. I enjoy all of mixed pholosophies mixed into a wierd intergallatic setting. I have to admit... I did enjoy it somewhat, but I've seen better. Not worth dressing like a Star Wars character and wait in line for a week or so. (You guys, learn that this is FICTION. You waste too much elbow room with those maniac costumes in lines, and scare the children and the public.) The little boy speaks so unnatural-- like he is reading lines off of somewhere. Still, what a superb acter is he. This boy will age like good wine, assuming he will change and grow in character selection. Is it worth to buy it on DVD? I say that this is good enough to rent on VHS for a night from Blockbuster."
4,The Force is with you young skywalker,"With George Lucas's fantasticly mythic story,filled with Lasser swords,spaceships and classic outerspace villians,Jedi's and Dark Lord's battling for the fate of the Galaxy and a young unknown boy with a destiny that would find him.This beginning chapter of the most stiring saga in film history,is filled with anticipation and mystery.Well acted and exciting this 1st motion picture in a series of 6 films is not quite as deep,and adult and elaborate as its later enstallments, but is a shadow of later things to come.Absolutly spectacular special effects.A must peek for everyone."
2,Flavorless Eye-candy,"This movie really looks great, but I can't seem to remember much of the plot or the characters."
1,Jar Jar must die!,"If Jar Jar is in the next movie, I'll only see it if he get beheaded by a light saber. It was sad to see this movie made into nothing but a money making cash cow for George Lucas. The movie wasn't made to be a great movie, it was made to sell merchandise. I suppose I would have liked it quite a bit more if I was 6 years old but sadly I'm not. Shame on you George!"
1,The Phantom Yawn,"The star is for the special effects.While I wasn't expecting the exact same excitement of the original movies, I was hoping for some. The plot is extremely drug out. I tried to watch this movie 4 times, and fell asleep each time. (The first time was in the theatre.)Major disappointment that I will keep next to my Tylenol PM."
2,Not so good.,"I consider myself a pretty darn hardcore Star Wars buff. And I still have to admit that this film was lacking. Pacing was rushed and choppy. I never felt emotionally ""there"". Sorry all."
1,George Lucas IS The Phantom Menace,"This film, like the rest of the Star Wars prequels, is utter garbage. It's become apparent that Lucas cares only about the technical aspects of moviemaking, and not the need for good storytelling.The dialogue is pretentious and awful. Jar Jar Binks is insulting, even to a child's intelligence. Jake Lloyd is the worst child actor in history. Gary Coleman could have played a better Anakin Skywalker!Some of the plot elements don't even jive with what Lucas filmed years ago. Anakin created 3PO? The Force is a bunch of microbial entities in your bloodstream? Anakin was an immaculate conception?I suppose the writing was on the wall when Lucas ruined his own masterpieces in the forms of the Epidode 4,5,6 ""Special Editions."" Greedo shoots at Han first? I don't think so."
5,Is The Force with you?,"Many (MANY) people complained that George Lucas made us wait far too long for far too little. I thought Episode I was a great show. Jar Jar this, and blah blah that. People are natural complainers, but I had a grand ol' time watching this (3 times) in the theater and owning the video now.Very few movies are perfect, yet most people EXPECTED this one would be. Like any movie, it has it's problems I'm sure (whatever each person thinks), but George Lucas is not God, he's just a man who makes movies. And this one I thought was very good. I look forward to the next two chapters.My only complaint is not about the CONTENT of the movie, it's just a disappointment in the fact that the DVDs are not available and the rumors that Mr. Lucas will NOT make chapters VII, VIII, & IX!Is the force with him?"
4,mmmmmmm.......Jar Jar is anoying,"i loved this movie and i cant wait to see the next 2. The only thing about this movie that bothered me was Jar Jar. While i thought he was amusing at times for the most part we was quite a bad adition to the film. The plot was great and continued in George Lucas' story line quite well, though personally i liked episode 4, special edition the best of all the available starwars movies. But then what good would a full set of wide screen and cut starwars movies be without at least 1 copy of episode 1. So sufice it to say i will be getting 2 copies when it comes out. One for me and one for my sister. I know you'll enjoy this flick and as i am a true star wars fan i would have givin it 5 stars were it not for Jar Jar. Well anyway George Lucas' company Industrial Light and Magic (known best for Jurasic Park, among others) did a supurb job with the special effects in this movie. Again......ENJOY IT"
3,A disappointment,"I love Star Wars and was thrilled when I heard about ""The Phantom Menace."" I went to the first showing at area theaters. I was sorely disappointed. Jar Jar Binks, in particular, had looked so cute and funny in the previews, but was stupid and skittish on screen. Indeed, his whole species was rather ridiculous; it's a shame, because they had real potential to be endearing and heroic. That was sacrificed in favor of bathroom humor and clumsy antics geared towards children. And Jar Jar was not the only character to whom that applied. In one or two scenes would have been bearable, but it went on throughout the movie! Aside from that, the movie was good, but the end felt really unresolved. Overall, it wasn't bad, but wasn't nearly what I had hoped. Had I anticipated a children's movie, I think I would have enjoyed it. But I didn't. I went to see an epic. It fell miserably short of my expectations."
2,"Decent summer movie , just where is the DVD!","This movie is the first of the star wars movies. It more family friendly and it has the annoying person Jar Jar BInks(who I would love to kill or get out of the movie! Jar JAr is just extra stuff and comedic relief. Other than it OK just I wish they would of developed the story and Darth Maul ! Darth Maul is one of the lamest villians of last summer! Now please hurry up George Lucas and start putting your movies on DVD! But if you decide not fine, just expect to lose millions of millions of dollars in this new format superior to VHS tapes!"
3,Send a Message.,"I think that DVD enthusiasts should send a message to Mr. Lucas and not buy the video nor the DVD when he releases it in the year 3000, or when ever. Star Wars and THX are synonymous with one another. Star Wars means digital, 5.1 sound and awesome video clarity. You can not experience this with the analog VHS release. It's a shame that the movie industry thinks it can make us wait on their terms. I remember when the movie mongers who made the Titanic tried to do the same thing. And when they released the the DVD version I chose not to buy it. Let them suffer and eat the loss. Again send a message to Mr. Lucas and make ""him"" wait instead."
5,"Don't be a snob, enjoy it.","Is it my favorite Star Wars movie? No. Is it my least favorite? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Face it, you just can't have the same experience as you did when you were 12 in 1997. Just sit back and enjoy. Good DVD extras."
3,Too Much CGI?,"The ""Star Wars"" saga begins 30 years prior to the first ""Star Wars"" where we are introduced to much younger versions of characters which we will be forced to hate at the saga's conclusion. Unfortunately, Episode One doesn't have the same dymanics as the others in the series. Perhaps it is the artificial look of the CGI footage, or the faltering storyline. The only reason to watch the film is to complete the saga started back in 1977, and to enjoy the talents of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, and Pernilla August."
5,Not as good as A New Hope but still very good,If you like Star wars buy this movie If you've never seen a star wars film well then your just crazyJUST BUY THIS MOVIE
3,If this wasn't a Star Wars movie it would be ok.,"Star Wars Episode 1 is a discrase to the whole set of movies.Not only is there bad acting but there are [weak] vilans, I also thought it could have been better with a better Anakin, not the kid in Jingle all the Way, he's just a bad actor.I also thought Obi-Wan could have been better, Liam Neeson was good in that as Qui-Gon.Natalie Portman was also a good princes Ammidala.This was actually pretty good but it was a Star Wars movie and they arealways supposed to be grade A, not B.The Pod race was pretty cool but that was about it, this movie was more of a heartbreaker and not action.George Lucas probably got this done over the weekend.That's poor.Now I have to talk about the DVD.It's alright but it's no Termanator metal box special edition, obviously.Ok, if you really like Star Wars I would get it but if your not a hardcore Star Wars fan, rent it."
4,Great movie...,"Great movie, but the special features are much too long and tedious to look at. I tried to sit down and just watch the special features, but I found it near impossible. I had to turn it off and go to something else quickly. It just seemed like a waste of time to put all that stuff on there. I can't imagine watching all that footage, even now, it's making me sick to my stomach... Excuse me while I head to the bathroom to vomit, LOL!"
2,"Very Disappointing, but Entertaining...","""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" is the much-anticipated prequel to the everlastingly popular ""Star Wars"" series. I thought it was going to be much better than it was. The special effects were good, but overly flashy. The presence of the annoying Jar Jar Binks wasn't needed and just took away from the development of the other characters. The acting was good, but the story was lacking that certain ""Star Wars"" element that audiences have been accustomed to with ""A New Hope,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" It's entertaining enough, but what happened here!"
4,The Phantom,Pretty good. Little boy Anakin is great. Much less whiny than his older self. My husband pretty much loves Qui-Gon Jinn and there's that crazy sith with the red and black face paint.
1,Why... Why'd he have to do it...,"Damn you George Lucas, damn you for ruining the Star Wars movies. Some day I will meet you and tell you this."
3,How do you define ambivalence?,"I measure it against my reaction to this flick which I saw both in the theatre as well as at home on video. From a technical standpoint, it suffers from an excess of special effects. It seems to me that having major characters such as Jar Jar exist only in digital form is a crutch; but a crutch for what, I cannot tell you. From the standpoint of the script, having young Skywalker destroy the federation's command ship by flying inside and blowing it up is a lazy rip-off of the first (chronologically speaking) Star Wars movie. And Liam Neeson? <sigh> Just going through the motions, IMHO."
3,Good fun,"Ah, the controversial ""Phantom Menace."" Well, give Lucas courage for trying. No matter what he came up with would have been pounced on by somebody. I won't complain that the acting in this film isn't great, because it wasn't in the original ""Star Wars"" movie either (except for Alec Guiness.) What we have here is a spectacle. I shouldn't complain about that either, since specatacle films were practically invented by ""Star Wars."" Nowadays, however, special effects don't seem so spectacular. Our culture has become dulled to them, so that even all the sound and fury here can't impress us. In this case, Lucas will have to develop some more engaging characters if he is to hold our interest. But it was definitely worth a look. I enjoyed watching this film in the theater, where it was more impressive than it is be on video. It was eye candy, not much else, but that's all I expected. I hope the next one is at least this enjoyable, and hopefully even moreso."
1,The Beginning of the Destruction of the Franchise,"George Lucas really cannot write or direct. This (and the the 2 subsequent ""pre-quels"") are horrific movies with terrible acting and even worse writing ."
3,Why is there no DVD or LD for christ sake?,"I don't understand why George Lucas is not ready to release TPM on DVD or LD, at least on LD,like he did with the Special Edition. A man who earns so much money, is only interested in making more profit. He could have released the LD at least in the US to satisfy those who have a LD-Player and not the Japanese Version with Subtitles but nevertheless, for everyone who wants to experience the real Star Wars feeling, they have to wait until Spring 2006. Shame on you George Lucas."
3,Star Wars Episode I - The Phatom Menace,"Well, I have to admit. I didn't actually see the Star Wars trilogy until it was re-released in movie theaters. I was very impressed with the imagination of Mr. Lucas...until this movie. Granted, it had great special effects, but I have to agree with the critics that there was too much that was in the grey. I know I am in the minority on this, but I hope Episode II is a little less offensive."
1,boom boom boom,"That's about all you'll get out of this movie. No story, stupid dialogue, just special effects. Nothing else happens. Not enough to sustain this movie for more than a minute."
2,Special Effects Save The Day,"If it wasn't for the amazing special effects, The Phantom Menace would have crashed and burned. But even the special effects are wasted on a weak plot and some mediocre acting (mainly the kid who plays Anakin Skywalker). The pod race scene was nice as well as the underwater world, but overall, something just seems to be missing. The movie doesn't really go anywhere in the end. The other Star Wars films were much more focused and exciting. The Phantom Menace was good on the big screen, but after watching it on video, I grew sick of the film immediately. The film is average and if you didn't see it in the theater, then don't bother with the video."
3,My kids liked it...,"That's why it gets three stars. Kids will enjoy it. Is it up to the standard of the orginals? Not even close. If Disney were to buy the rights to Star Wars, I'd expect them to make this. Nothing against Disney. My kids enjoy their movies too. I just pray that they don't bring Jar Jar Binks back for Episode II."
2,Star wars used to be cool,this movie is decent but the only reason it got 2 stars is because episode 2 is one of the worse movies ever just stick to the original star wars they rule but this movie is close to hoorible
4,"Good film , poor quality VHS","Although the acting was alittle ""stiff"", I thought this was an exciting movie with outstanding CG (Computer Graphics). Unfortunately when G. Lucas transfered it to VHS standard format (the cheap version) some of the film quality is lost. I was one of several individuals who noticed the quality difference. I had to purchase the wide screen collector's edition to find a much beter, VHS version. I still do not under stand why this film, the Star Wars Trilogy, and Indiana Jones Trilogy are not available on DVD?"
2,Don't Buy the PAN and SCAN...,"I was really excited yesterday to pick up Phantom Menace yesterday but was really disappointed when I watched it last night.Most of the the movie is so ""compacted"" that you miss part of the action at times that takes place to the left or right from the center of action. Example: When Naboo is invaded, Droid fighters fly past the palace (in the movie). On video, you hear but do not see and the focus on the queen looking out the window is a little jerky.Most reactions from actors on the side are missing as the action unfolds, etc.AVOID THIS VERSION LIKE THE PLAQUE.Lucas couldn't be bothered to put the time into the DVD version that he must have fallen asleep at the wheel on this version. Gee....Thanks, George.Good Movie..Buy the Widescreen (I am, anyne can bid on my ""viewed once"" copy in Auctions.)"
3,BIG Letdown! ......you know.,"So many years passed since the last Star Wars, and a lot was expected. I wasn't like these geeks who expected the greatest thing since slice bread, but I did expect a good piece of work. The movie was a letdown in almost all aspects. The story resembeled Christianity a little too much. Young Darth, the ""chosen one"", and his angelic Mary-ish mother, just too much! Anakin(I know spelled wrong!), was a little too talented. I know he is supposed to be this great warrior, but it's never cool to see a smart-ass little kid. And Jar-Jar was, well you know. The effects were good but not great, the droid fight was too fake looking. I guess the only true bright spot were the fighting scenes. I especially love the Jedi vs. Darth Maul battle, very very good."
1,"Just because it's ""Star Wars"" doesn't mean it's good","there is no character depth... the entire film is a superficial blow'em up science fiction movie.Dont say the original movies were like that.. because in the old ones George lucas had a lot of heart and character to the characters... now they're just stand ins in a movie that George Lucas obviously didn't want to make. I was anxious to see this movie since the old star wars movies, but now I have no inspiration to see Episode 2. I hope Lucas doesn't make it."
1,sheer commercialism,"Star Wars used to be a respected franchise...Not Anymore! Interest in the next prequel will be even less than PM after the dissapointment in this one. Also does Lucas really think he can move the market with his VHS only stance? He's only going to be remembered as the Grifter he is to shake more money out of the rabid ""fans"" out there who need to get a life anyway."
1,Not another cent from me Georgie boy!,A Lousy film designed as the Ultimate toy and merchandising Commercial hence the bad Acting and woeful Script.
1,I HATE THIS STUPID MOVIE!,"This movie was an outrage to the Star Wars saga. How did Mr. Lucas even release this terrible piece of film. Jar Jar MUST DIE. He was terrible, I missed half the movie because I could not understand one word that he said. Anakin MUST DIE AS WELL. What a terrible actor! How could George Lucas think that he was even acceptable. This torrid excuse for art is money in Mr. Lucas' pocket, he must be stopped. I can not believe that anyone liked this movie! What is our movie world coming to? I HATE THIS MOVIE!"
2,Here's how I rate the STAR WARS films from best to worst:,1. The Empire Strikes Back (5 STARS)2. Return of the Jedi (4 STARS)3. A New Hope (3.5 STARS)4. The Phantom Menace (2 STARS)
1,What ?,"When I first encountered the first, or Im sorry the prequel or whatever it was, some twenty years ago I was enchanted by the somewhat radically unradical notion of the film's premise, simply two men having a conversation over dinner. It was a thoroughly delightful film which stimulated me. But now, I mean I really dont get the spaceships or poorly designed aliens. Louis Malle what were you thinking. I didn't even see Wallace Shawn throughout the entire film."
2,The biggest dissapointment ever!,I was expecting not to like this film alot because I feel Star Wars is maybe the best film of all time. But E-I was worse than I could ever have dreamed. Other than the pod scene nothing in this film was worthy. I was sad for weeks after seeing this film. What a shame.
2,"Star Wars - Episode I, The Phantom Menace (Widescreen Edition)","Because packing is not steady, a package and a CD are damaged"
1,WHY WAS THIS MADE?,"I waisted 2 hours of my life on this movie simply by watching it. I feel bad for the people who waited in line for days to see it. There were a lot of good actors in this movie, but they were a waste. I think Ewan McGregor is a great actor, but for some reason or another, he was bad in this. Liam Neeson is also very talented, but it didn't show in this movie. Jake Loid couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. The movie relied on the it's digital effects 100%. They were good, but not 2 hours. Hey, I'm not wasting extra time on this movie for my sake. I want to help you. I want to enlighten you. THIS IS BAD, DON'T BUY IT!"
4,"The movie is still poor, but the DVD is good.","First off to those out there who are surprised or disappointed that there is no DTS version. Three little letters can answer that THX. THX is Lucas own sound, why would he produce a DTS version when what he wants is more people using THX. It doesn't matter whether DTS is better or not.The Phantom menace is still plauged by a poor script, poor directing and at times poor acting. The special FX are of an extremely high standard, as well as some new innovations.The DVD etras are very cool and worth it. The movie isn't trash. It just is not as good as it should have been. The DVD is well worth the money. And a good edition to your DVD libary."
5,The Phantom Menace is a great movie!,"Ok, I do not understand why people have given Star Wars Ep I such a hard time. I am a hardcore SW fan, can't wait for Episode II and didn't think this movie was extremely bad. Yes, Jar Jar was an annoying character, and the midichlorian thing is a little strange, but COME ON! This story is not complete! We must wait until Ep II & III come out before we should totally judge Anakin's story. I believe this one was meant more for the kids, so in thinking as a child, I can see why they love this movie. I gave this one 5 stars because it is a great movie for all ages, but focuses more on children, unlike the original trilogy which was best for more mature audiences. Just wait until Ep 2. ...."
4,"Okay movie, but the best DVD out there","I'm a big star wars fan and I have to say I was a little disappointed with the film when it first came out in the movies. I don't think its as bad as a lot people said it was, its an okay movie but it is the worst one out of the star wars series. The story is kinda weak and some scenes just didn't fit or make sense in the movie. But as far as the DVD is concern, if you have a surround sound system in your house, this is a must buy DVD. The sound in this film is simply amazing, this is the best DVD to show-off that system. The special features are also great with a lot of behind the scenes, documentary, and deleted scenes stuff. Also the pod race is the best part of the movie and you get a longer version in this DVD. That by itself might be worth."
3,For Kid's Only,"""Return of the Jedi"" had some elements which seemed obviously directed to a non-adult audience, but nothing compared to this flick. Some movies, like ""Last Action Hero"", can succeed at this level, by offering a satirical edge in addition to the fantasy element (which is more appealing to the youthful crowd); even pure fantasy movies (""Brazil"" or ""Willow"") can be appealing to adults. But this is clearly a kid's movie, since the main character is 11 or so. I realize that, in order to set up the eventual parts 4,5, and 6 (or whatever), the characters need to start out young. That's no excuse for making Star Wars into a kid's film (I mean, even ""Flight of the Navigator"" can be entertaining to an adult; this wasn't.). I'm just glad I didn't bother to see this in the theater."
2,Should have been MUCH better,"Ok, Ok, before you hate me for my review. Ask yourself, 'Did I feel disappointed when the end credits began to roll?' Well, their ya go! 'Nuff said."
5,It was only the beginning!,"This album is absolutely amazing. Some of the greatest songs ever produced by the band were introduced to the world through this CD. Remember 2 things was actually made first, but was not the first label release. If you like the new stuff, then get to know the old stuff, cause it really does exceed The new stuff by leaps and bounds (I'm talking about Everyday). Everyday is very unlike any other DMB album in the past and will be different than anything to come. The truest roots of the band can be found in albums like Under the table and dreaming and remember two things. Some people will tell you that the songs are too long for a studio album but if your a fan, that is what you love about them. It's one of the most original and magical albums you will every listen to. I guarrantee it. This is what great music making is all about. I think we can expect more of the same from Busted Stuff."
5,It has a great tempo and every song flows together perfectly,"This cd is great first for the band. It includes up beat songs like ants marching mixed with a slower, more gentle song like lover lay down. The lyrics are awesome in every song and can make connections with anyone who listens to it."
5,An elaborate cd that touches on every emotion,"This CD and all of DMB CD's have a song for every mood. His deep thoughtful lyrics and up lifting beats make ""Under The Table and Dreaming"" a must buy. It's a meaningful folk song kind of melody that everyone should have the right to enjoy."
5,Dave is the BOMB!!!,"There is nothing better than this group out there today. When I first heard this album, I didn't like it much, but something made me keep it. I went back and listened to it again, and it grew on me. They are now my favorite band. Dave is the acoustic guitar god, and his band rocks too. There are so many great songs on here like Jimi Thing, Ants Marching, Satellite, they all rock, BIG TIME. I have seen these guys live six times, and my ticket stubs are ever growing in my wallet. I would reccomend this album to anyone, it's that good."
5,This is there first cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?,"omg!!!!! this is one of the greatest cds ive ever herd, and its there first! DMB is by far my #1 favorite band of all time. Everyone in the band is the best musician of what they do. Every second of this cd is good from TBOWA to #34.Songs that really stand out are: Jimi Thing, Warehouse, Ants Marching, #34, Dancing Nancies, and typical situation."
5,Awesome,"I don't care what anybody else says, I think this is one of the best cds of the 90s. Dave Matthews Band has a brilliant sound that is entirely its own, and their joyous, spirited music invigorated just about everyone when Under the Table came out in 94'. I remember the first time I heard Ants Marching on the radio. I was knocked out. What an amazing song! And the whole record is amazing too. The Best of What's Around, What Would You Say, Satellite, Jimi Thing, Warehouse, they're all spectacular songs. I'm not even a hardcore Dave fan, but I could honestly say that this is an essential album. If you're unfamiliar with these guys, Under the Table and Dreaming is definitely the place to start."
3,Mixed Bag,"About half the songs on this CD, including ""Satellite,"" ""Ants Marching,"" and ""Lover Lay Down"" are quite enjoyable and show a good sense of the melodic and the rhythmic, and in some cases both. The other half meander without direction or purpose, but even then this crew aces the ever dreaded Phish by far."
5,The Complete CD,"Dave Matthews Band's, Under the Table and Dreaming, is one of the best CDs I have ever heard. Every song on the albulm is enjoyable to listen to and the range of song styles is great. This is one of those CD's which you let play in your CD player completely through."
4,"A very good, I would even say great CD","A mix of superb, great, and good songs along with maybe a couple of fillers(Dancing Nancies). A good start, but I prefer ""CRASH"" and ""BTCS""."
5,Killed the CD,"Had the CD. Killed it. I really just love DMB when they play the music a bit darker, and this album does that for me. The musicians in this band have so much talent, it's crazy. ""Rapunzel"" is a perfect display of that statement."
4,almost perfect,"Only the second album released by DMB, it's my 2nd runner-up for the category of ""classic DMB album,"" with Crash winning out; still, it was a tough choice. On the whole, there are a greater # of good songs on this album than on Crash, but the few great songs on Crash (like ""#41"") are better than the best songs on UTTAD. So, this bumps Crash up a notch though UTTAD isn't far behind. You might dubb it pre-classic DMB. In any case, this album still honorably retains one foot in the grass roots mire, though during its release the music was well on its way to widespread mainstream recognition. Like Remember Two Things and Crash, it's essential for DMB-lovers and a mostly happy-go-lucky mood provides an uplifting listening experience, despite the occasional darker themes. And don't forget ""#34"" on hidden track 34."
5,oh yeah,".Dave took me a while to get used to, but this cd kicks tail. The awesome instrumentals hopefully will inspire today's popculture to higher hights.Catch a ride on a Satellite!."
3,"Dave Matthews, bland?","I admit I'm one of those who never cared much for these guys. I didn't hate, I just didn't love like I do alot of their peers. Coincidentely that changed once I got this album (ten years later). Now I'm not a member of the fan-club yet, but I do enjoy this debut of theirs. In truth, this is probably the best place for a newcomer to start, as it seems to be fairly hit-heavy. ""What Would You Say"" and ""Ants Marching"" are both upbeat hits. My favorite track ""Satellite"" and ""Typical Situation"" show off the softer side of the band well. I even think I've heard ""The Best Of What's Around"" on the radio before. Another big plus is that there are no songs that I don't like. Overall, I might not be seen at the next show, but I'll be keeping and listening to ""Under The Table And Dreaming""."
5,I love this CD!,"Sometimes music can turn into a lot of noise, but not DMB. When you close your eyes you can hear all of the different insturments. It's for hyping up and cooling down. It amazes me that there is so much going on in the songs and it still makes sense."
5,Betcha can't listen just once,"This is more than a major label debut...it is a musical movement. These songs actually tell you how much they care about you. ""Hey my friend, it seems your eyes are troubled, care to share your time with me?"" Emotions run wild in this album. What would you say if your grandmother called on your birthday with the worst news ever and your buddy died fighting for freedom? Matthews knows exactly what to say to the ladies and Beauford provides the most solid drum line yet. Moore and Tinsley throw down with catchy melodies while Lessard holds the bottom with a pudding like tone. These guys are on fire and destiny has brought them together to make music."
5,The best CD of all time.,"First off, the people who gave this CD anything lower than 5 stars are complete fools. This is the best DMB CD, and he is the greatest musician ever, so this is the best CD ever. It does not have one song on the whole CD that i do not like. DAVE IS A GOD!"
1,Tone deaf vocalist,"This guy can't sing. He is tone deaf. When I listen to this garbage, I want to try teach him how to sing correctly."
1,It amazes me that DMB fans riot.,"It amazes me that DMB fans riot at many of his concerts. I was working at a venue that hosted DMB and there were cars flipped over and then set on fire in the parking lot. The ironic thing was a few weeks previously we had Marilyn Manson and the riot police and protesters were in full force and the worst incident was a teen getting busted with some drug or another.But the more I think of it the less it shocks me that there are riots and fires and chaos at DMB shows... it's basically Woodstock for frat boys, and what better way to celebrate the band you love after a couple rounds of flip cup than to go out and flip cars? Oh I know a better way! Light them on fire afterwards! ALL RIGHT, DMB ROCKS!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!!!!!One thing I REALLY don't understand is the ""WOOOOO!"" Why is it every time you show a crowd of these people on camera the only thing they can do is shout ""WOOOO?""Anyway, enjoy the CD. This band has enough albums to make a complete set of coasters."
1,Under the table and sleeping,"This album is a snooze. I had it for like three months when it came out. I no longer have it. What does that tell you? That the songs on this CD are forgettable tripe that deserves to sit in used and cut-out bins for the rest of eternity. If all the squawking horns on this album don't give you headaches, then Dave Matthew's donkey-with-pinched-nose vocals will. I've heard better music by street performers. In a word: atrocious."
1,DIE YUPPIE SCUM,"Dave Matthews Band is easily the worst band in existence. The vocals make me shudder to think that my eardrums will soon heal after I stabbed them out after hearing this. It is awful, and every suburban teenage yuppie is singing along to this album in their Ford Explorer, proclaiming ""YEAH MAN DAVE IS LIKE SOOOO RAD!"". 0 stars."
5,Awesome,"This is the best cd I own. I got it on a whim, now I can't put it down. There's something magical in these songs. There's no way that you can't just fall in love with them. I'm a fiddler and am always looking for fun new material. If you ever want to hear great instrumental parts, this is the place. The mix of instrements and Dave Matthew's unique voice and hilarious/ meaningful lyrics make this a classic. It's really a cd for everyone. Whether you're into pop, punk, ska, or country, this is for you."
5,"DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, buy this album!",Buy this album and you will love it. Then a few months later you will go on the look out for more music and find that nothing can compare to Dave Matthews. And the album you end up buying is Crash. The patern continues with Before These Crowded Streets. Now your really trapped. And you end up getting the two live albums. Then find out their are two releases before Under The Table And Dreaming and you get those. Then you are stuck for good. That's where your CD collection stops. Listening to anything else makes you sick. And you check the DMB web page every ten minutes for word on when their next album is coming out.
4,"Good, but as sparse as a monk's diet.","These three short stories that make up the book are good, but lack the intrigue of the novels. The first story, A Light on the Road to Woodstock, is particularly interesting in that it tells how Bro. Cadfael came to the cowl. Because it is such a quick read, devoted Cadfael fans will want to read this book."
4,Got the answers!,We wondered where Father Cadfael came from. Had the answers in the front two pages of this book! The three short stories just added to the series.
3,great refresher on crate-training,"Booklet was a quick read and written in the same, pleasant-toned format as Morn's other booklets. Instead of purchasing all of Morn's info-booklets, I would recommend buying _Dogs Love to Please_ as I believe it generally contains the same information. If you want very specific directions on how to crate train though, go for this book."
2,save your money,"doesn't tell you anything more than the instruction manuals that come with all crates. In fact, there's even less information than you'll find in a chapter on crate training found in all good puppy books. Save your money."
1,PLEASE DONT BUY THIS!!!!,"I bought this book thinking it might be funny/light reading - incorrect. The only word for it is garbage. From the start of the book to the 91st page, where I gave up, because I felt it demeaned the art of writing to continue reading this book which just contained a number pathetic sentences grouped in paragraphs creating ridiculous scenarios."
5,Perfection in a hot water bottle? yes,"I liked my first, clear Fashy and just recently replaced it with 2 red flannel covered ones. They are amazing, don't leak, hold the heat all night and smell like cinnamon. I'm so happy with them that I may give them for Christmas presents next year."
4,rocks,"this lp deserves recognition...i've just become a fame of their pre 80's material. they have so much versatlatily musically it's crazy, they put all these other groups to shame. I see where (en vogue) really got their guts from, the Pointer Sisters.this contains a song written by Bruce springsten, mick jagger, robbie roberton.. produced by Richard perry, who's produced everyone from diana ross to carly simom ..........check it out...most likely you'll find it in your local VINYL SHOP"
4,SWV The remixes.,"This cd is wonderful. I expected with it's age it would come with lot of scratches and perhaps the songs would not play and that they would skip, etc. however I was quite surprised, it played fine as many times as I needed it too, which were alot as I needed it for a party. It was shipped out fast and came in plenty of time. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
3,Ridge Racer 2,"This CD is a little more tolerable then the first Ridge Racer soundtrack. There is a little more variety and the techno isn't as quite ""pumping"" as on the first game. Still, this soundtrack doesn't compare to Ridge Racer soundtracks like part 4, 5, 6 or 7... For hardcore fans only."
5,Great Product,"Used both Emedia Guitar Method 1 & Intermediate Guitar Method. This product complements the Emedia products very well. The Intermediate Guitar Coach is very challenging, but the beauty of it is it allows you to work more on technique and playing in time with the whole band where emedia gives you a great theoretical approach with learning the different techniques and reading it in standard music notation. Both companies make it a great multimedia combination."
3,This is good but . . .,I felt the narrator was trying to get us to lose Irish pride. The history was interesting and done well. The slant was a little off for me.
3,"Hardly ""Mommie Dearest""...","What a pitiful situation...a daughter holds her parents hostage to what some of her doctors say is Asperger's Syndrome which some believe is a type of autism. The daughter creates a unending hell with her hysterical demands, verbal abuse, risky behavior, and an overwhelming unhappiness with her empty life. Her parents can do no more than acquiesce for year unto year until finally they decide to (spoiler) ""leave"", and even attempt to talk their daughter into accompanying them into the freedom that none of the three have ever experienced.This is a harrowing, well-acted, depressing, and educative film. I would have given it four stars if it had provided more back story, but perhaps the focus was meant to be solely on the three nuclear members who, in the end, manage to find a bit of peace after all.Cast, acting, and script all well conceived and executed."
1,Only works with older Oregon Scientific Base Stations,"Just purchased this sensor assuming it would work with my existing Oregon Scientific Base station and another one I just ordered.Unfortunately this particular sensor (also sensors THR138 and THN138) only work with older base stations running the ""1.0"" protocol (newer units run ""2.1""). Here is the list of base stations listed at the Oregon Scientific site that support this older sensor:BA928 BAR338PA BAR888NA EMR812 JMR828 JMR838WF JTR168LR RMR112So only order this sensor product if you have one of the above product numbers listed on your base station (unless you just want to use this as a standalone temperature sensor)The Oregon Scientific web site has a complete list in a PDF file as far as which sensors are supported by the various base base stations, so if you aren't sure, check out their site before ordering an additional sensor for your base station."
1,indoor-outdoor thermometer,"Uses 4 batteries. 2 in indoor thermometer, 2 in outdoor thermometer. Will not work in cold weather"
4,"Beautiful, inventive and erotic!","Blue: The Color of Desire is one of the few novels that don't illustrate BDSM in a negative manner. The story is tantalizing - and the S&M parts drip with sensual prose in their brutal facade. Blue is quite a wonderful protagonist. Her love for her master helps her endure the painful training process. At the end of each session, she is rewarded with affection and enormous pleasure. This novel - along with Breaking the Girl and The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty - is a favorite of mine. Erotica has become one of my favorite guilty pleasures, and I shall pull this wonderful book out of the shelf whenever I need a guide to inventive eroticism."
4,HOW TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THIS BOOKS FOR YOU,"This story is about a teacher (the master) and the student ""Blue"" who for a few hours a week exist together in a fantasy world including S/M and bondage. The book is well written, but if your looking for something with a super in depth plot with only parts of the book being sexual, this might not be what your looking for. This book was full of hot scenarios and language , definitely meant to arouse. You may feel the need to put the book down and take a break :-)"
1,Not into pain,"Premise of the book centers around a woman and her relationship with her ""master"". She literally writes her fantasies on her body and eventually paints all her bodyparts blue. When she visits her ""master"" he reads her fantasies and then binds/tortures her in some fashion. This includes such things as whipping, spanking, caning, hot wax, electrodes, clothes pins, body piercings, etc. It only results in her ""pleasure"". They don't have a physical relationship. The only relationship they have is him inflicting pain and humiliating her. Bottomline, if you are into S & M like this, you'll probably like it. If your version of S & M is more along the lines of playful spankings before a man and woman have sex, you won't."
3,Blue,"""Blue: The color of desire"" is an erotic novel about a D/s relationship, written in a very poetic, lyrical style. There are definitely some hot parts, but for the most part it wasn't exactly the kind of writing I prefer. Just a personal preference though...I prefer something written in a more realistic prose sort of style, I just don't relate as well to this kind of thing and don't get off on the poetic descriptions--I'd prefer something a little more gritty. Still, there were some hot bits, and even though it wasn't exactly for me, it was definitely very erotic. If you like a more poetic style of writing and enjoy BDSM erotica, I would recommend this."
5,Gospel Favorites,This is an essential recording for the true gospel music lover.Elvis along with many of the great southern gospel quartets perform a host of legendary gospel songs. A must have for the collector of gospel music.
5,Amazing Grace cd,Hi I really injoyed amazing grace cd by Elvis Prestly it was a great cd I ordered 2 and both of them were in great condition and very clear I bought one for a gift and one for myself been enjoying them ever since. They came within 3 days thank you very much for you fast service.
3,disappointed,"I did not have a real change to listen to this cd till after xmas i have used it a few times and both cd's skip in places, i love the cd but it just does not work very well"
2,This album is simply devine,"The title of this album says it all, ""His Greatest Sacred Performances"". I played these Cd's over and over and over. Just couldn't get enough of Elvis's heavenly voice."
4,Those who like Elvis...,"You really ought to consider getting this CD if you enjoy either gospel or Elvis. The first few songs are not nearly as moving as the last, but do have an interesting period sound. When Elvis really gets into it, you will remember why you bought this CD"
5,A Blessing for Christians of all ages,"I bought this 2 CD set for my beloved because he had lost his CD. I listen to these myself and these 50 Christian songs have become a tremendous blessing to me, in fact I intend to buy a copy for myself as well. There are songs on these 2 CDs that fit every situation that person goes through in life. One of the most amazing things about it is that as you listen to these songs it gives you a glimpse into the spiritual life of Elvis in spite of the tremendous temptations he went through in his life. His early introduction to Jesus in his childhood influenced him his entire life. He never lost his love for Jesus nor the Christian hymns that touched his spiritual life. It is obvious that these songs had meaning for him and the other performers and that they enjoyed the experience of recording them. Surely these songs he recorded were a blessing to him in his final days on this earth."
5,Elvis was one of the greatest interpreters of Gospel songs ever,I wish more people were aware of just how great Elvis was at singing Gospel and inspirational and uplifting songs.
2,Crib attachment is HORRIBLE...,"The piece that attaches to the crib is NOT ideal. You have to make sure the crib railing is not too thick or you won't be able to use this at all. We had to do some things to alter this mobile to fit our crib: First we had to place a buffer between the attachment piece and the crib because it tends to scratch the wood crib edge and since we invested in a convertible crib that will one day be my son's full size bed, we want to take good care of it! The other thing, is that our crib has curved edges and the mobile hangs at an angle because of this so we had to cut a piece of styrofoam to keep it standing straight. (Not too appealing on the eyes!) I suppose if you are buying the whole set, you could take the mobile itself off of the crab attachment piece and be creative to find another way of attaching...but how much work do you want to put into it!?"
2,DOESN'T FIT,"I was so excited to get this mobile but when I went to put it on the crib it doesn't fit. Some of the new cribs, like mine, are really thick on the sides, back and front railings and this mobile is not made to fit this style. I did give it 2 stars because I was able to figure something out for it to fit securely. Still a dissapointment. Also the nautica sticker on the music box part is upside down and now I have to find something to remove it."
1,SIZE MATTERS!!!!!!!!!!,"My sister recieved this mobile for her baby shower, but when she got it home it did not fit on her crib.She Was upset because she spent $200 on the set and does not even have the matching mobile for it now.How DISAPOINTING"
5,The Rest of the Story,"My Dad never talked about the War, WWII. He mentioned casually that his ship had been attacked by Kamikazis, and he had to swim for it. I didn't know the whole story until I got this book. There is an interview with my Dad, and others from his shipmates describing the sinking of the Dickerson, his ship, and I've since discovered that the Dickerson was originally an anti-sub escort in the North Atlantic before moving to the Pacific to carry landing craft for island invasion troops. Lt. James D. Ebert is dead since 2001, but I was proud to make his acquaintance this year in this fine book. If you had family on destroyers in that war, buy the book. Even if you can't find them in there, you'll get an idea from all the first hand accounts of battles just what they went through."
3,Interesting but wooden writing,"This book is fascinating--stories from a rural vet in Canada, treating everything from cats to cows. The sad part is that Perrin isn't a very fluid writer, so it is sometimes a chore to get through.I had the sense that if Perrin had just dictated these stories and had worked with a good editor, it would have been a much better book."
4,Hilarious and a must read for any animal lover!!!!!,"These books take you through hilarious and moving stories, real life stories of new veterinary in a little town. It inspires you to reach for your goals and never take no for an answer, great for inspiring vets or any animal lover!"
2,This is a very biased book.,"While I enjoyed reading this book for my research, I was disgusted by the author's constant references to Christianity as a better religon than the pagan traditions of the Vikings. When I engage in historical research, I expect to be presented with facts, not the author's opinions as to which religon is better. The author constantly makes comments such as, ""The viking raids were caused by the poor resources of the region, but eventually ceased when Christianity was introduced and the Vikings became more satisfied with their lot in life.""I intend to write a long letter to the publisher about the editor's inability to remove religious commentary from a book concerning the history of a people. I advise serious researchers to locate other sources, as this book is excessively biased."
2,Is it working?,"Bought this along with a heater for my 5 gallon frog tank. The thermometer got here over a week after the heater came, even though i ordered at the same time. And now I am not sure it's working. I felt the water before the heater - very cold. I felt the water 24 hours later after the heater - much warmer. The thermometer never changed. If it were to work, it's small, grips to the side of the tank very easily."
4,good little thermometer,The thermometer seems to be working good and was delivered on time. The suction cup that it sticks onto the tank works great and doesn't fall off.
1,Poor imitation of a Kong product,"I was very disappointed with the Kong Air Dog Squeaker Bone. I have a 4 yr old Dashund that loves squeaker toys; he is also a chewer. I have purchased Kong products before because they are the only toys my dog has not destroyed. The Kong Air Dog Squeaker Bone only lasted 5 minutes with my Dashund. He had the cover torn off and the rubber chewed into little pieces. If your dog is a chewer, DO NOT waste your money on buying this product. It will not stand up."
2,Not Happy!!!!!,This book is horrible it only good if your not a first time learner the the cd really sucks it doesnt even talk to you to help you sound out the words I wasted my money next time ill just buy it at school. The seller didnt even but a picture on the page nor the edition so in general I got the wrong book and cant get my money back.... Im going to a different website amazon lost my trust..... :-(
4,good clean fun,well fellas and ladies it oil wrestling done in a shooty night club so it not the wwf or g.l.o.w. but it is a nice video and worth watching if you like ladies dipped in oil and wrestling. very nice looking girls.
3,mediocre,"The ladies looked hot, but all the action was fake. There was only 1 good match between 2 ladies, and I think that was fake. The wrestling with the men was definetely fake."
1,Mandy Moore Self Titled Album,It was the wrong CD I wanted Mandy Moore's self titled album and instead I got Mandy Moore's So Real album. What can I do? I am seriously un-impressed with the service I waited over a month for it and it was the wrong one I will not be wasting my money here again!!!
4,Mandy's 2nd album is better then her 1st....,"By a long, long way. I mean, her last album was cool, but this one has so many catchier songs on it.My favourite songs:""One Sided Love"", ""Saturate Me"", ""It Only Took A Minute"", ""Turn The Clock Around"", ""Split Chick"", ""Yo Yo"" & ""From Loving You""That's nearly the whole album. I prefer Mandy's faster songs, to her ballads. ""From Loving You"" is the best ballad, and my overall favourite is ""One Sided Love"". It has a really Eastern feel to it, and awesome music.Mandy is very talented, a good actress (Who saw her in The Princess Diaries?) and sooooo pretty! She's gonna do well! Go Mandy, Go Mandy!"
4,Mandy Moore - All Grown Up,"I bought this album, not really expecting much. What I got? A some-what grown up Mandy, that I wasn't really expecting. Granted, she does still have some growing up to do, she's surely on her way. The tracks in this set that stand out to me are the single, ""In My Pocket"", the elegant ""Saturate Me"", the smooth ""17"" and the ballad ""Cry."" Definitley an album for the contemperary pop lover in you."
5,Impressive.,"On ""Mandy Moore"" Mandy delivers a more mature sound which her fans will find most intriuging. The majority of the album is basicly pop rock music like Natilie Imbruglia or Sixpence None the Richer so if ur into that kind of music u'll love this album album. But for the Mandy fans who loved her dance pop debut ""So Real"" you might not like this. The only real dance song on the album is the fast pumped ""In My Pocket"" which is just a great song that is impossible not to dance to. The album also features more middle-eastern influenced tracks like the soulful ""Saturate Me"" and the bangin' ""One Sided Love"". The album also features tender ballads like ""17"" and ""When I Talk To You"""" which Mandy co-wrote herself. This album is very very good and I think all of you will enjoy it. It's a new Mandy Moore that you'll find on this album which I know you'll all enjoy."
5,Mandy Rocks The House By Charlie Starkman,"The Mandy Moore ""In My Pocket"" is my favorite! My favorite song on the album would either be ""Saturate Me"" or ""In My Pocket"" Anyone can and should listen to this CD, boy or girl! I have all of her CDs. But this one is by far the best! Her vocals are better and different! I especially love the hip and happening dance rhythyms! To sum it up, Mandy, YOU RULE, GIRL!"
3,This girl definitely stands out from the crowd,"I purchased this CD, having middle-of-the-road expectations, based on other reviews here. While I am somewhat disappointed, the fact is, even when ""disappointing"", Mandy Moore still runs circles around Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and the rest of her fellow teen pop princesses. Not only is her music light years ahead in style and quality, but judging by her TV appearances, the girl has a much more down-to-earth personality than the aforementioned vocalists. Attitude is just as important as talent. Highlights here: ""In My Pocket"" with a great meditteranean kind of feel, as well as ""You Remind Me"" and ""17""."
5,Mandy's best CD thus far,"I have been a huge Mandy Moore fan since the first time I ever heard ""Candy"".I bought both her previous CD's and loved them and I of course could not wait for this one to come out.After I heard ""In My Pocket"" I knew this CD would be awesome and sure enought was.Mandy has really grown up since her first and second CD.Her lyrics have changed as well as her style of music.There is not one bad song on this entire CD.The stand-out tracks are ""In My Pocket"",""You Remind Me"",""Crush"",""17"",""When I Talk To You"",""Yo-Yo"",and ""Saturate Me"".This is a must for anyone who loves pop music."
3,Surprisingly Good!,"Remember Mandy Moore in the sickeningly sweet Candy days? Well, she hasn't completely abandoned her bubblegum image, but her new album shows that she is trying to grow as an artist and gain at least some artistic integrity. The result is a mostly satisfying cd with some cool songs like U Remind Me and Saturate Me. When i Talk to You, the only songwriting effort by the teen diva, is also a heartfelt, enjoyable song. Get this album if you enjoy pop with a liittle bit of an edge- it is better by leaps and bounds than any Britney Spears album."
5,Great CD!!,"This is a really good cd. Mandy's songs have gotten better as the years gone by. There is not one bad song on this cd. My favorite personally are Crush, Split Chick, One Sided Love, and You Remind Me. This cd is original and edgy, excellent pop. Mandy Moore is now my favorite pop princess. You will not be disappointed, trust me!!"
4,Great overlooked cd,"This cd was great overlooked when it came out. This is really sad because this is one of the best albums to come out of the teenage pop sound. The thing that makes it interesting is the use of Middle Eastern rhythims, along with a little bit of rock. The album is pretty eclectic. My favorite tracks are: ""Yo-yo"" and ""Saturate Me"". I also like: Hand in my pocket, Cry and Crush.If you like pop, don't sleep on this album."
4,Im a rock/pop (not poppy) music lover,"I like this CD. I like how she is striving for a different alternative to mainstream pop. it is nice. SHe is still pop. but it is not annoying like so much radio music. Im into music like Cyndi Lauper and Michal jackson and Jane Child and Poe and stuff. but I like this. and she has shown now, i think she will keep getting better and better with her music. I also like how mandy more does not sell her body to the public. I think she is a good singer for younger people, cause they could be allowed to look up to her. . I am 19 now and I think she is heading in the right direction. I also think mandy is cool cause she listens to alot of singers that alot of people dont know about."
2,Better luck next time,"There is no doubt she got talent but unforunately most of the songs she's been making are very dull. It's more of less Pop even though some songs are a little diffrent. ""In my pocket"" is a good and catchy up tempo song. Many songs are ballads(not so good one's though) and the rest are more or less typical pop. ""Cry"" is a decent ballad however. Emilio Estefan Jr has been writing many songs we also got yet another ballad by Diane Warren ""From Loving you"", perhaps Mandy Moore should have called Max Martin cause atleast with his stuff she sould have got a few hits or maybe she should get more into soul-pop like Christina Aguilera did, her voice is good enough for a try. She got the talent but she's not into the right kind of music yet."
5,A Better Sound For Mandy,"I have wanted to get this CD since it came out in June, but things got in the way and I only bought it in August. I am pleasantly surprised on the advancement over Mandy's last album. Obviously, her voice has grown (she was 13/14 when she recorded ""So Real"") and she has influenced her music with her own style. A lot of the album focuses on Middle-Eastern music, including the single ""In MY pocket,"" ""Saturate Me,"" and ""One Sided Love."" But, there are also well-written ballads (including one Mandy Moore co-wrote)and edgy-upbeat stuff including ""Yo-yo,"" ""Split Chick"" and many more. I can honestly say that I don't hate any of the songs on this album, they're all good and stand replay well. ""So Real"" was a good first album, but ""Mandy Moore"" shows that this girl isn't going away."
3,Mandy is okay,"This cd isn't THAT great. There are a few good songs, but most of them have sorry beats. The lyrics are all good, but it's hard to like a song when the beat [isn't good] , right? I agree its better than her pervious albums, but definitely listen to it somehow before buying it. You MAY be disappointed...depending on what kind of music you like."
4,Not another bubble gum pop album,"I loved this album. In this album Mandy really broke away from the bubble gum pop scene with songs like ""17"" and ""You Remind Me."" I really liked the oriental sound in the first few songs as well. She has an absolutely beautiful voice that fits right in between Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey minus the drugs and lost sanity. She still has some growing to do but she's young and I believe she will achieve alot in music and in acting and who knows what else."
4,Mandy sounds great live!,"While I haven't heard the album, I'm basing the review on two live television performances Mandy gave in Melbourne, Australia, in the last couple of days.I'm an unashamed fan of pop and 'In My Pocket' happens to be one of my current favourites. However, Mandy's voice in the live performance was sometimes lost due to the heavy middle-eastern sounds.It was the live 'unplugged' performance of 'Crush' where her voice really shone through. I'm no expert but she sounded incredibly sincere.Mandy was interviewed before performing 'Crush' and showed a level of maturity, intelligence and 'realness' which coming from a teenage pop star was really refreshing."
5,Mandy rocks!!,"Mandy's third album is definitely more mature than her other albums and it has a different sound to it.I especially like the songs n My Pocket,17,Saturate Me and Cry.f you are a pop lover and fed up with Britney's and Christina's songs go and grab this fabulous album."
4,Mandy Moore at the Max!,"This cd is very good, it expresses Mandy very well. It has a mix of both slow and fast songs so it's not repetitive. Mandy has a lovely voice and it should be appreciated."
5,Best teen pop of the year,"It's not surprising so many amazon.com reviewers like this album. After Britney, Christina, Jessica and the like doing the same-old-same-old the past few years, it's so refreshing to see a teen artist really do something different. Here, Mandy Moore ventures into Natalie Imbruglia/Alanis Morissette territory, and if you liked those, you'll like this. She's not trying to be the next Madonna, Mariah Carey or Janet Jackson (those gals are still doing just fine, thank you). She's staking her own sound and direction. If that results in less album sales, that's fine with me. I like being in on a secret."
4,Not a pop fan - but love this cd!!,"I normally don't like pop music --never have-- but I did find myself with this cd as a holiday gift when it came out, and I loved almost all the songs. They're upbeat and easy to sing to. And, as much as I do love Mandy Moore's movies, I've never been a fan of her music besides this album. I still have the words stuck in my head all these years later, so am about to re-purchase the cd :)"
5,"About ""One Sided Love""","I Liked to review the song ""One Sided Love"". I am from Turkey. I think nobody knows that the intro of this song is a Anatolian Folk Song. (Anatolia is the Asian part of Turkey) I felt very happy to hear my peoples' music in an American album. An interesting result of globalisaiton.."
4,A masterpiece...,"I have to tell you that I'm still amazed, this album is so great that I can't believe. It is nothing like Mandy's ""Candy"" or some ... like that, it is a cd full of some great sounds that you'll love. You will hear a completely new Mandy Moore, singing in such a lovely way and sound. I hear every single song and I love them."
4,That's Mandy Moore Singing? O.o,"I've never been a Mandy Moore fan, in fact I thought she would be one of the last pop divas to successfully make it into the market because she had the least vocal talent and was one of the youngest. The only song of hers I ever remotely liked was 'I wanna be with you' from the movie Center Stage. Then I listened to this CD-- it took a listen or two, but pretty soon I had to admit that her singing was pretty good and the songs quite enjoyable and not as annoying as I would have expected from her. The songs are well balanced and everything on the CD in general is listenable. After going though a lot of albums lately that are disappointing aside from the singles they hold this CD was a welcomed treat. I give it 4 stars out of 5 only because Mandy can still improve vocally and perhaps as she matures further, her music will get better too. If you like pop you should definitely check out this cd."
4,Wow!! Miss Moore shows a whole new level of maturity.,"In my opinion, I think that this album shows a whole new level of maturity within Mandy Moore. My favorite song is 17 because it's the perfect song that relates to the relationships that many teenagers often go through. Unlike the first album, Mandy has shown that her vocals have improved throughout the years. Also, the melody of the album gives a unique tone that most listeners may not have heard before such as ""In My Pocket."" All in all, I think Mandy did a good job in this album."
4,BETTER THAN YOU'D THINK!!!,"I am a huge Britney Spears fan...and haven't been a big fan of Mandy Moore's. However, I heard the first single one day from this album, and enjoyed a lot. After I heard the decent reviews of her new second cd, I decided to buy it. Believe me, I am now also a Mandy Moore fan. My fave song is ""One Sided Love"". The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does have some really weak songs, but oh well."
3,"Better than ""So Real"" and ""I wanna be with you""!","It is true that Mandy's first two album's were terrible. On the album ""So Real"", I only liked two songs. ""Candy"" and So Real"". But I got tired of hearing them within the first week of listening. On ""I wanna Be With You"", I liked ""I Wanna Be With You"" and ""Your Face"", but the fact that most of the songs were on her previous album made me listen to it about 5 times total. This album is much better! I'm already sick of ""In my Pocket"", But I love ""You Remind Me"", ""Saturate Me"", ""Cry"" and ""Split Chic"". But the rest of the songs are terrible. Mandy's voice isn't that great. Even adding effects to her voice like in ""Cry"" dosen't help that much. If your looking for a young popstar who can sing, check out 15 year old Myra's debut album. It's much better and has a unique mix of pop, latin, and soulful music. But if you are looking for a good song, buy this for ""You Remind Me""."
2,"""Not That Innocent""","When I heard Mandy Moore came out with a new album, I rushed to the store to buy it. I liked the lead single ""In My Pocket,"" so I expected a sound more mature then ""So Real"" and ""I Wanna Be With You.""What I got was a mess. It may not be as disapointing as Christina Aguilera's debut cd, but still dissapointing. I listened to the whole cd and came to the conclusion that ""In My Pocket"" was the best track. Here's the review for the 3 singles she released off this album with 5 stars being the highest and 1 star being the lowest.""In My Pocket"" - *****""Crush"" - ***""Cry"" - **"
2,great voice,"I have to say, I was a little disappointed as I first listened to this CD, because the first Songs I knew from Mandy were those from the Soundtrack ""a walk to remember"", which -in my oppinion- are much more powerful and whith much more feeling.She has a fantastic voice!!!I was wondering if this is her stile, some of the Songs on this Album have a oriental touch somehow.I like the Song 17 though, it has something very melodic.Another thing I didn't liked that much is, how they show her on the pictures in the booklet.She is just a girl!!!I believe that there are a lot of sexy clothes, wich do not show so much skin and still look good on her, since she has a perfekt figure.I have a lot of respect for the work she does and I love her movie""a walk to remember"".You go, girl!!!"
2,Mandy Moore,"As a fan of pop music, I really didn't like this cd. It is very different than her usual style. I think that she will loose a lot of fans that liked her hit song ""Candy."" On this cd her voice was kinda annoying and the songs are all basically slow, sappy, and the few fast ones are middle eastern styled. It seems that she is trying too hard to get away from the ""pop"" section. What is wrong with pop music anyway? She liked it though when she was selling her records and making lots of money. I can give her credit for trying on this cd, but is seems like she is trying too hard to be Nelly Furtado- but with songs like ""Yo-Yo"" it just wasn't working. I guess if you are a big fan of her music you'll buy it anyway. But if you liked Mandy's old sound I'd say check out Jessica Simpson's new cd. It is really great and she has got an awesome voice!!"
2,How disappointing!,"I got this album two summers ago, and loved it. Then, now, two summers later, I have matured a lot, and am over this kind of music in general. I recently listened to this, and I couldn't make it all the way through the songs (I would listen to each song halfway through). They got really repetitive, and it was just some pop fluff. No depth whatsoever as far as I can tell. When I was a big fan, it never occured to me that Mandy didn't write any of the songs (one of you said she wrote ""Split Chick,"" no wonder it sucks). So what's the point if she didn't even write it? Hell knows. Don't bother. Try Fefe Dobson instead."
1,Just too annoying,"i would prefer if she found a new word to rhyme with mandy besides candy. how can you compare someone like mandy moore to the greats like celine, whitney and faith?"
2,Different isn't always better,"The first time I heard this album I said to myself that it was a little different, and I guess I kinda liked it because of that. But to be perfectly honest this album never found its way back into my CD player after that. Her voice is far from incredible, and the songs are all pre-fabricated to suit her breathy, sugary voice and that got really old. Although the traditional teen-pop songs may finally be getting old, the material on this album will not be able to carry Mandy into the next generation as hard as she may try. At this point in her career, she is more of and actress and a personality than a musician. Already there are signs that this album will be a flop, and just because it is different doesn't mean it will be successful. I admire Mandy's attempt to be different (or rather her song-writers attempt to be different), but that doens't mean I have to like the album, cuz it is already in my CD pile that I will rarely play again."
2,Major disappointment compared to her first CD!!!,"I liked 8 songs from her first album (So Real) because they were all danceable. Then this CD comes out and I only like 4 songs. What's wrong with this picture. It's like she's slipping away from her talented dance roots and throwing in more sappy slower songs. Experimental. maybe. The problem is so many new artists appear to be doing this same action. I usually prefer to buy tapes when anyone's second album comes out so I can copy the few songs that are good. Even with a little tape hiss, it still saves me more money and aggrivation. When you buy a CD based on a Dance Hit that's what you usually expect most of the album to contain. If you want a really good dance CD I would recommend Vitamin C and More Vitamin C, Dream's first CD=It Was All A Dream, La Bouche=Sweet Dreams, or Mandy's So Real CD."
2,ah another one,"there isn't much wrong with this cd but then again there isn't much right with this cd as well.What Mandy Moore really needs is a breakthrough hit,like the brilliant 'one more time' that song established Britney as a star and made sure that whatever she did after didn't have to be very good(and it isn't).What makes this album so unlistenable isn't that its awful(pink) or that there are too many ballads(aguilera) or even the fact that it is soulless R'n'B(brandy,keys etc etc) no its the mediocrity,the fact that she tries everything and falls just way short."
4,CIRQUE RIP-OFF?!,"So...Am I the only one who noticed that ""In My Pocket"" is a sample of the song ""Hinko"" from Cirque du Soleil's show Dralion? Does Cirque composer Violaine Corradi get any of the credit for originally writing the guitar riff? Actually, I think it's a pretty good song, but give credit where credit is due. The 4 stars are for ""In My Pocket,"" as I haven't heard any the other songs from this CD."
3,A Dissapointed Fan,"I used to love Mandy Moore, but after hearing this cd I've lost a lot of respect for her. In My Pocket is an awesome song..my favorite on the cd. But I can't find another song that even comes close to being enjoyable. The lyrics are unoriginal and at times just plain corny...especially with all the oriental background music. If your a true Mandy fan then I'm sure you'll enjoy this album no matter what, but for those of you who are expecting a good cd, then I definately do not recommend this one."
1,Too boring,"To be honest, I ""expected"" more from Mandy Moore. I really thought the CD would be more upbeat, from what she said. As I was listening to it, I almost fell asleep. She had ballad after ballad! If you're planning on buying this CD, you might want to think twice."
3,blah blah blah blah yawns,i cant believe i was suckered into buying this [thing] my god this girl can make me sleep easy first off let me say i have her previous 2 albums which arent that great but it is better than this self titled album reall come on in my pocket has to be the wirdest song ive heard in months well anyways that shows how she had a poor debut on the charts in my opinion samatha mumbas album is way bettr than this [one] not to diss mandy moore ...
2,Its alright.,"This CD I woudlent recommend for everyone. Expecially those who just cants tand Pop Queen Brittney Spears. There are some good songs like ""Crush"" and ""In My Pocket"" With a nice flashy beat. But songs like ""One sided love"" Just really make no sence! 'One sided love is never gonna work, lemme show a way that Im sure it'll never hurt' something like that but its not right. I wouldent really recommend it for most people though"
2,lacks anything special.,"Over The Years, there have been many teen girl singers. Mandy Moore being one of them. When I bought this album her 3rd cd, I can say I was very disappointed. I found the album totally lacking with only the occasional standout track. She went totally downhill with this one."
5,WOW,"is all i have to say. There are so many songs on here that are just simply incredible. It's a shame that 'Mandy Moore' hasn't done that great on the charts. It debuted at number 35 and soon started to fall. BUT! It has already gone GOLD (500,000 copies).Some of the stand out songs on the album are In My Pocket, which was the first single, 17 which I can see as prom song next year, When I Talk To you which Mandy wrote, and One Sided Love which has a rock feel to it. I'm not sure Mandy can top this one. But she has already guaranteed she would on her official website. Trust me, if you don't want to buy it just because it's ""MANDY MOORE,"" you're missing out on something. Mandy should receive a grammy for this wonderful album. Just buy it and see for yourself!"
4,Nice little - cheap filter,"The Cascade 300 inline filter is a good cheap filter for a five or 10 gallon tank that requires a slow to medium current (I use it in 5gal betta tanks) but I would not recommend it in anything bigger as any bio-load over 'light' would overwhelm it.It has a bio-sponge section and a ""Disposable Carbon filter Cartridge"" that they want you to buy in packs. I pried open the cartridge it came with to find low grade carbon pellets so I replaced them with Marineland Black Diamond Premium and it works even better now."
4,"Works well, but...","They don't state this anywhere in the product description, but the Cascade 170 is tiny. Like, fits in the palm of your hand tiny. It's 3 inches tall, roughly. Don't let that fool you, though, because it pumps water like a beast. Even on the lowest setting, I'm going to have to build a diffuser so that it doesn't blow my poor betta in circles around the tank. It's a powerful motor, but I'm not sure yet if it'll work for my tank because it's so small.Also, I can't seem to find a carbon cartridge anywhere on it. The only filter media I've found is a black stiff sponge, but I might be missing something. It's not really a problem, I guess, but given that it says mechanical and biological filtration, I expected some carbon in there somewhere. The fish in my tank don't produce much waste and I've gotten into the habit of vacuuming the gravel every week or so anyway, so I guess it's not that big of a deal."
4,Mostly recycled but worth it.,"This is mostly recycled adventures from first edition sources. I wish more of an attempt was made to link the adventures together and the experience levels are arranged a bit oddly. The beginning adventures appear later in the book. However, there is a good mix of materials including some classics and one or two hard to find scenarios. Overall, it is a good grab bag to throw at your group."
4,"It's the liks, baby","This isn't as great as their awe-inspiring first album, '21 and over', but it's still a damn fine bunch of tunes.. nice beats and samples (if lacking the old-skool crunch of '21 and over'), well-chosen guests who aren't too intrusive, and best of all, no gangsta pretentions - just straight up party-style MCing that'll make you realise just how wack the average rapper is these days compared to the glory of the 80s..watch out for the highlight, 'flashback', which pays amusing homage to everyone from parliament to the sugarhill gang."
4,Magic in a bottle,"This product works for so many things. Not just electronic switches, pots, and audio gear. I used it on my cable TV ends. The TV had some wavy lines in the video. Took off the coax screw fittings, brushed on a little, replaced - clear as could be!."
5,Great find,"The one disappointed reader didn't read the full title of the book. It's The Law School Bible: How Anyone Can Become A Lawyer... Without Ever Setting Foot In A Law School! And that is what it delivers - perfectly. it is by far the BEST book on the subject. It is also the only book that discusses what foreign law graduates need to do to sit for the bar, and how to get into a foreign law school and study from home. If you think you can't be a lawyer read this book."
2,Really Misleading Main Title!,"I can't believe the author calls this book ""The Law School Bible."" This book is all about distance-learning (i.e., correspondence) law schools. (Only the state of California recognizes long-distance law degrees.) If this is what you're looking for, the book has some interesting and potentially useful information. But this is NOT a book about law schools in general, and you won't find coverage of mainstream law schools. If the book title hadn't been so misleading I'd have given it 4 stars for the content on distance-learning law programs."
4,Great Book,"I received this book from a friend and although I am not usually a reader of the vampire genre, I REALLY enjoyed this book. I loved the suspense scenes and how well the book flowed. Plus I liked the throw backs to 80s music and the Long Island references. It kept me interested to the point where I was sneaking reading it at my desk at work! I have already passed on my copy with rave reviews. I really enjoyed it."
4,White Cannibal,"Its a really hot cd for those who like no wave jazz. Its a must for fans of James Chance. The recordings are better than most of the previous albums. The recording quality has improved much, but has a way to go for clarity needs to be."
5,Very Useful Book,"I found this book to be extermely useful for my work. Excellent code snippets in the Advanced DBA section and the T-SQL section. The comparison between Oracle and SS2K was very good as well. We run both Oracle and SQL Server databases in-house and I can now relate to the lingo that our Oracle DBA's talk about.It expects some knowledge of SQL Server so is not for novice users. Overall, a 5 star rating book."
4,Good performance tuning chapters,"The chapters on performane tuning is good. Some of the chapters that delve into other features of SQL Server 2000 are average. I bought a used copy and haven't been disappointed. Infact, I was looking for SQL Server 2005 books since I have to make a decision between moving to SS2k vs SQL 2005 but could not find good books on SQL 2005 that dealt with the new features of that release. This book as well as Kalen Delaney's book worked out well for me."
3,Average Read,Not a great book as it was made out to be. Some sections are ok but the text is very basic and is meant for beginners only.
4,Good Book,I wish there was more coverage on transactions and locking architecture of SQL Server but overall it is a good book.
1,a big pile of sh** in disquise as a cd,this sucks so much! Please stop making these cds. Whats next? Toddlerz Bop featuring elmo and barney in London bridge is falling down? people who thought of this being a great cd must have been constipated!
1,Suckfest,"The day I bought this cd was the day my life went donhill. Ilost confidence in the music industrY, DUE TO IT BEING EXPLOITED BY TALENTLESS LITTLE PRICKS. If you are a cmplete and total idiot then you will buy this cd. Open your eyes and read the reviews. THIS CD IS CRAP!!!!"
1,Why?,"This is pure evil and i heard some the kids were spawned by Satan. He took a big Steaming dump and use it to make the kids and then made them make crappy music that can make people envy the deaf this makes Jesus cry, Chuck Norris can only listen to it for a few mins before killing everyone near him in rage of how bad this is. if i had one wish ide wish for 2 wishes and use them to have all the kidz bop CD gone and then ide wish that all kids who try to make new kidz bop crap turn back in to satan's crap [...]"
2,Huh?,"I can't believe that they copied the songs, ""Here Comes The Sun"" and ""Yellow Submerine"" by my very most top favorite band, The Beatles! The Beatles sang WAY more better than those (off-key) kids!P.S., I'm madly in love with The Beatles."
1,"OH, JOY OF JOYS! THIS IS SUPER! :-D :-D :-D","Hi everybody! Oh boy, what a crazy year I had! My daycare in Pennsylvania (!!!) got bulldozed to put up a strip mall, and now I am in the process of starting up a NEW one! :-D I still gots Corey, Sethy and Tony! MY LITTLE ONES!!!! :-DWell me reviewing Kidz Bop Gold. ME AND THE LITTLE TYKEY POOS LOVE IT!!!?!?

I mean Amazon would never delete my reviews... right? HAVE A JOYOUS DAY!!! Love Mervie"
1,SING ALONG WITH UNCLE CRAPPY AND THE CRAPPETS,"Once again the publishers with the So Called ""greatest selling cd in the history of Kids cds"" has done it again. But this time they took some of the greatest songs ever and put them through a meat processer and just mutolated it. They took 2 of the most popular songs of the beatles and derailed them. Just get it through your head Producers of Kids Bop. STOP MAKING THESE *&()*()&)(*&*(&)(*& *(&(*&(*&^ F$^$^%#%&$%$^%$^%^%#$@#$^ #$^%#$ ^%$#^%#$^%#$^%#^%#^ % Cd's and just put the actual songs on there. Please for the sake of man"
5,Kids Bop Gold,"I bought this CD for my 7-year old nephew. He liked it, but his parents liked it even more because it was age appropriate."
1,For the love of God sedate me,"Listening to Kidz Bop is more painful than getting a swift blow to the head with dad's PVC pipe extension, and believe me I would know. Where are those anti-depressants that cause kids to commit suicide, because I could use the strongest one you've got when mom puts this crap on in the minivan. Playing this CD around children should be the equivalent to verbal abuse, and it virtually is. Please protect the sanctity of music and not buy this compilation of bastardized hits which blew enough to begin with."
1,HIYA PPL!!!,I LIKE TOTALLY LOVE THIS CD! ITS LIKE SO COOL! I LOVE IT AND I LOVE THE CUTE LITTLE KIDS SINGING THE SONGS! THE ADULTS HAVE GREAT VOICES ALSO!SIKE!!!!!! HAHAHAHA u actually beleived ppl would like this cd. it like totally SUCKS. hahaha that cracks me up. l8ter
1,EVIL,"I never believed that it would happen...but it finally has! Kids bop has finally destroyed everything good in the world!!! What were they thinking whenever they decided to destroy stuff done by the Beatles? And ""Happy Together"" that was one of my favorite songs! And now look at it! Just, dead, rolling on the floor, dead. How can any sane parent buy this for their children!?! It's crazy! If you want good music go out and buy the originals!!! The original artists are sooooooooooo ashamed...and for all you crackheads who say that, kidz bop is for 'kidz', I AM a kid!!! Let me repeat, KID. And I absolutely HATE this CD!!!!!!!! Sure, toddlers may like it, but that's because they're tone deaf!!! And whatever parent buys this for their children is apparently tone deaf as well! Don't raise a tone deaf nation! Don't buy 'kidz' bop!!!!!-Mokuren"
3,The Kids LOVE IT!!,"PLEASE people - these CD's are not for us they are for the kids and honestly they could screen the singers alittle better, but my daughter does not seem to care. She sings right along with them and if you dont want to hear them singing do what I did and purchase a portable CD. They sell them right here for about $20, and everyone is happy. Kids Bop 9 is being advertised right now and my daughter 5 is begging me for it. (It is not avail in stores yet). So suck it up if it keeps them occupied and happy and it is radio edited as a previous reviewer mentioned what is the problem?"
3,Listen through your kids' ears,"I know this has gotten some really awful reviews, but what I think people are forgetting is that it is not intended for them - it's for the kids. My five year-old daughter loves this cd and I would much rather have her listening to this than whatever garbage the Brittneys and Christinas are spitting out."
2,Early Failure,Suboptimal for travel because the display light can be too easily activated with resulting battery drain. The display failed after about two years. This happened while the clock was sitting on my night table and was not the result of mechanical impact.
5,Best travel clock for sound sleepers.,"This is a wonderful travel clock for sound sleepers. I have used other travel clocks but the alarm failed to wake me up. I am grateful for the previous comments regarding this clock. It is worth the extra money. I have spent so much on travel clocks which were totally ineffective. The clock is small, about 3/4's the length of a pack of cards and about as thick as a pack. When I travel by air I do as current TSA suggests and place the batteries (2 small AAA) in the clock. Thanks to the manufactor and to Amazon and its reviews."
5,utterly enchanting in every way,"This book was a childhood favorite of mine and my mother's, not just because of the story but because of the illustrations. We read it regularly and then had fun finding ""irregularities"" in the pictures that made us laugh. This book tells a beautiful story about human spirit and compassion that is ultimately what we all look for in a good life where there is love and love in its simplest form. One of a few books that I saved over 41 years, this is one that I have never regretted lugging around from location to location. Truly a childrens book that adults can have fun reading. Sometimes it can still make me believe in ""Prince Charming"" Then there is the pie."
4,Got this for my niece's birthday,"So, here we have a princess, a king who loves pickle-chiffon pie, and three suitors.And the three suitors go to find something AMAZING to show their devotion to the princess so they can get married. (Spoiler - the one the princess likes is the one who wins. And you know, she has good taste!)They each find something great, but the third suitor has to leave his prize - a Gazoo who bakes pickle chiffon pies! - behind because it has babies. *sniff*Bless his soul, the king realizes a great story and a compassionate heart when he finds one, and everybody is happy at the end. I adore this book to pieces."
5,One of my true favorites,"This book is fabulous through and through. I love the creative, quirky illustrations and the imaginative storyline, but what really sets this book apart is the beautiful message: that the right prince for a princess is the one who shows kindness and consideration for others. A great message for girls among the princess-fantasy filled world of books. My daughters are 9 and 12, and I've been reading this book to them (less and less, of course) for at least 10 years; it's that's good and that fun."
4,great gift.,We gave these to my mom and she loves watching them. She is unable to get cable and she loves cooking shows.
1,Extremely poor quality,"I do not recommend this video due to its extremely poor audio and video quality. As far as the content was concerned, it wasn't any help for our purposes - planning a trip to Germany. It's basically a very superficial video tour that might be tolerable if its quality was better."
1,NOT GOOD,THIS PRODUCT IS VERY POORLY MANUFACTURED WITH CHEAP MATERIALS AND DOES NOT HOLD. THE STRAP CAME LOOSE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT AND DID DAMAGE TO MY BOAT MOTOR FROM THE BUCKLE FLAPPING AROUND IN THE WIND ALSO THE STRAP FRAYED IN THE SHORT TIME IT WAS USED. NOT WORTH THE MONEY NOR THE AGGRAVATION....
5,A patriotic shot in the arm!,"In Honor of America is a patriotic shot in the arm! This is a visually stunning book with heartfelt prose that reminded me how proud I am to be an American. Photos from the author's travels across the country show the geographic, cultural and ethnic diversity that has made America a melting pot for people from around the world. The landscapes are breathtaking and the historical trivia included in the captions makes it an interesting read.I have this book out on my coffee table and everyone who looks at it finds something that captures his or her interest. The book says that half the proceeds go to a charity for children of fallen Marines and law enforcement officers which makes me doubly glad I bought it!"
1,Do not buy this!,"Most of the time, the pulse meter does not read my pulse at all. On the rare occasion that it does manage to give a reading, it gives an absurdly low (and obviously wrong) one. I was looking forward to improving my workout efficiency with this gadget, and am sorely disappointed."
1,useless,"This device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity. One must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal. Nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse, as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding. At best, this device MIGHT manage to acurately read a pulse AFTER a strenuous activity is concluded."
1,Terrible customer service,"Received the item but it didn't work, nor did it have very good instructions. E-mailed company 4 times with no response."
4,No Strap Required!!,"I love this thing. You do have to stop exercising to take your pulse, but I use it mostly for biofeedback. It is so great to use when I'm having a panic attack and cannot keep count myself. What I love most is that it's not expensive, but you don't have to wear any sort of strap around you!! And you can wear it just like anyother watch."
2,Not during exercise... Inaccurate measurement.,"I've got this meter a month ago. I intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise, but I've never been able to do so! At rest, the meter gives a reading after several attempts, but often inaccurate. You have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading. Now I'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch!"
1,would not buy it again.,"The pulse is difficult for me to get it to show my pulse and takes a long time , IF it does work. I got it for the pulse and do not like use it because of the fact that it takes to long. It does not cost alot and if you have the time, it is a cheap buy. One of my kids tried and it said they had not trouble with it. It just doesn't work well for me."
3,Nice product but not for me,"Was looking to replace my dogs' lost bells.Tried this one, but it was too big and clanky,and I have big dogs ! Nice product, though,I was just looking for more of a ""jingle bell""sound for locating my dogs outside"
3,"Monitor great, but headphones differ","We ordered 4 of these (2 on one order, 2 on another) for our band. They work well, but I am unsatisfied with the headphones that were provided. In one order, both of the monitors came with clear ""screw in"" earbud covers which worked well and were comfortable to wear. The second order of 2 came on the same day, in separate packages. The packs were different, even though we ordered a quantity of 2 of the same thing. The monitors themselves were correct and identical, but they had different earbuds provided, one of which was extremely cheap and unacceptable, as they were hard, not as pictured and impossible to wear comfortably for any length of time."
5,Great value,"A circular polarizer is a must for shooting outdoors with a DSLR. The HOYA G-series is affordable, yet of very good quality. It threads on and off easily (although I leave it on most of the time) and using it adds just the right amount of contrast and saturation to the sky while removing glare from surfaces."
5,Very good filter,"I've learned the hard way that cheap filters diminish the quality of the photographs. If you by a good lens, you have to by a good filter. This Hoya filter qualifies as a good filter in my book. You can pay more for a better filter, you can pay less for a cheap filter. You get what you pay for, so pay for what you want."
3,Broke when I needed it most but lasted 11 months.,"I didn't review this when I originally purchased it but feel i need to now.It's tricky I mean how long do you expect something to last. I bought this in July 2008 and it broke in June 2009 on an Alaskan cruise, something I will probably only do once. So I got 11 months out of it which is why I give it 3 stars instead of 1.The moral here is always have a replacement. Filters do get knocked about a bit so they wont last forever but this one just unraveled in my hand when I tried to take it off at one point. So great up until this point, but then isn't it always the way. I would probably buy another one to be honest as it did a great job up until then."
2,Sooo disappointing,"I got this to put on a Tokina 12-24mm f4, and I'm sorry to say it fails fairly miserably on that particular lens -- perhaps it performs better on other makes and models. When rotated for most saturation in skies etc, 'flat' tones become uneven and blotchy and there is huge vignetting when zooming anywhere around 18 to 24mm -- even stopped down to f22. My guess if that the vignetting wouldn't happen on a telephoto lens (with a narrower angle of view); however, my other guess is that the uneven and blotchy tones would still happen. Grrr. Lesson learned. There's no point AT ALL having a high quality (-ish in the case of the Tokina) lens if you're then going to hobble it with a less than top-notch filter, and this really is a less than top-notch filter."
5,"Engaging, Funny and Thoughful","When this book was handed to me, I though, ""Oh, man, looks like chick-lit..."" Okay, it kinda is, but there's definitely something here for everyone. Headley has accurately captured a facet of New York City that seems to be slowly vanishing: a sense of adventure that, when brought out of the self and into the world, can't help but affect innocent bystanders. In short, what makes New York New York. It isn't the coffee, it isn't the bagels, it isn't the rundown tenement buildings, it's the people. For those who have never lived in NYC, here's your chance to see what it's like, all from the point of view of one of those who make the city what it is.From a technical standpoint, the writing is first-rate: a fine balance of humor, sensitivity and the absurd.Read it and enjoy."
1,I've read better,"I agree with an earlier poster - the author seemed very proud of how well read she is. Half the time, I had no idea what the heck she was referring to, or what it had to do with dating.When I initially heard of the book, I thought it was a great premise. For some reason, I had assumed that the author was older during her experiment, because (in my opinion) a 20-year-old in college sleeping around for a year and experimenting with dating (including women) is normal. In fact, it's quite cliche'."
1,Disappointed...,"I read a review of this book several months ago and was so excited about the premise. I just knew this would be the prefect read during my Christmas vacation -- something all us single girls could relate to and have a good laugh. How disappointing......I couldn't even finish reading the book. (For the record, I can not even remember the last time I didn't finish reading a book.) I tried skipping the paragraphs that seemed so disconnected, but ultimately just gave up. If you still feel the need to read this book, visit your local library before spending your hard earned cash."
2,bleh,"for this genre, there a better, more light hearted books to read. the author is narcissistic, over educated, and self indulgent. completely takes away from the breeziness that i was looking for in a book like this."
1,awful,"I got a few chapters in and couldn't take it anymore. Saying yes to everyone that asks you on a date is a great idea. However, she spent so much time rambling about her life and things that had nothing to do with the guy that she was dating. I eventually just gave up."
2,Takes itself far too seriously,"A few days ago I reviewed a superficially similar book by Chelsea Handler called _My Horizontal Life_. In my review I said that Handler's book was the female version of Tucker Max's book, _I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell_.Well, this tedious little book is like the Bizarro-World version of Max's and Handler's books.Certainly Handler and (especially) Max are a bit sophomoric but they are never pretentious. Maybe it's just me, but I find sophomoric 20-somethings a whole lot more palatable than pretentious 20-somethings."
2,Pretentious and tiresome undergraduate style,"I can't believe the author has actually reviewed her own book on this site but anyway .I REALLY wanted to like this book BUT the pretentious style bored me we're constantly reminded how clever the author is ..F Scott Fitzgerald , pinter and hemmingway are shoehorned into sentences for no other reason then to show how well read the author is .Yeah we get it ,you got a library card well done you !Worse still none and I mean none of this story rings true is she another Frey ?"
2,The Year of I'm Not So Sure About This...,"A descriptive writing style that felt forced in places, along with an unrealistic plan, this book might be more appealing to the younger reader. Surely there could have been an easier way to say that your life will change if you open your heart to love...? And being open to love should not necessarily mean being promiscuous. But, hey, in the end the author gets what she set out for; it's just that we'll never know if she would have gotten it anyway."
5,Engaging and Witty,"This book surprised me. I was expecting fluffy chick lit, and instead got a real memoir, full of the good, the bad, and the ugly. It amuses me that other reviewers are so shocked and disgusted by Maria's sexual life; the book does not profess to be a self-help book. She obviously makes some horrible choices, and is not ashamed of admitting it. It is a funny recounting of the highlights from a hilarious year. Yes, of course she's name dropping and lit dropping and talking about herself - she's describing herself as an NYU student in her twenties. I dare anyone to find me an NYU student in their twenties who doesn't. What impressed me the most about this book was that it began as one thing ""I need to get a date with a decent guy"", and ended in a completely different place; how saying ""yes"" to the universe allows you to find yourself. This is a journey that most of us should go on, even if we don't follow the same rules as Maria."
1,Still waiting for my refund from a year ago from manufacturer!,"I purchased this hose from a local Ace Hardware. I love the ""flat"" hose concept as I live in a townhouse and it's more compact than a regular hose. I used to own one that I had purchased from Target probably 10 years ago! While the Ace price was twice what I had previously paid for it, I felt that it would be worth it if I got another 10 years out of it. Within the first 30 days it sprung a leak. I'm single, no kids so it was not abused in any way. I sent it back to the manufacturer per the instructions (cost me $17 to ship) on the packaging in Aug 2012 and am still waiting to even hear from them, let alone get my money back. NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR HASSLE!"
3,better to by The Man Who album,"I LOVE the song ""why does it always rain on me?"" but I detest the drunken (literally) screaching that is ""Baby One More Time"" and so I would recommend buying the full Travis album The Man Who. The entire The Man Who album is quite good and worth the extra money, if only to avoid the other song on this single."
1,Dean Martin 61 Great Performances: Not enticing,"Being a Dean Martin fan, I thought that owning this album would be a great addition to my collection. I was wrong. This album does contain 61 songs, many of which are rare. The problem is that the whole album is in mono - i.e. not stereo. This is great if you like hearing music as it was on AM radio, but not if you're looking for quality recordings of Dino. The treble was extememly high, the bass was too low, and the voice tracks never came out clearly. To add insult to injury, there were flaws on my copy of this 2 disc set that seem to be a result of poor recording. I would not recommend purchasing this album."
4,"very good, but also violent","This is a good book to read if you are into adventure, and if you don't mind some people dying that you might care about. Since O'Dell died while he was working on the manuscript, you can tell where Elizabeth Hall started writing, if you are familiar with Scott O'Dell's books. Nonetheless, I thought this was a good book for young adults."
2,McCartney's review,"I chose this book because I have read a book by Scott O'dell before and I really liked that book so I thought that this book would be just as good.This book was about a girl named Sound of Running Feet and the other members of the Nez Perce being kicked out of their home by the Blue Coats. Tribe members think that being kicked out of their home is bad but there will be more bad luck to follow, they still have battles to fight.Will they ever see their beloved home again?My favorite character is Sound of Running Feet because she is a young Indian girl trying to fight for herself and her tribe.The best part of the book was when Sound of Running Feet and Swan Necklace(her boyfriend)were captured by another tribe.If you are interested in wars and Indians then this is the book for you!"
1,records interlaced video,Video interlacing is dead. Hard to believe Japan is still churning out interlaced recording devices when all displays are now progressive.
1,Don't buy an Everio if you have a Mac and even on a PC it is bad,"I have a Mac and this product doesn't work at all with it. The customer support explained to me first that the software for the Mac was on the disk. After I called again they told me that I had to buy a product called Capty that you cannot test like any other usual product of this kind. I spoke to a supervisor and the the answer I got was ""OK... OK.."". They cannot certify that Capty works. On top of that, compared to Canon which produces great equipement, the photo I got with this camera are mediocre and the autofocus is poor. Never again I will buy a JVC product."
2,"Cool gadget, don't expect much more....",1-Not the greatest in low light.2-Terrible Still camera (grainy / bad quality... a sub $200 camera can do much better)4-Not the best software (can't do wide format)5-No Firewire6-No Remote7-A MiniDV camera can do betterPro:1-Small (tiny)2-Cool toy3-Easy to use
1,Defective Product & HORRIBLE cusotmer service,"Although the concept is good, the form factor is a problem. Snaping photos is not easy.Transfering video to a mac is painful and mind boggling that there is no support for this.Swivel broke down in less than a month and JVC should have simply replaced the camera but they have the machine for almost month with no eta on fixing it. The customer service center is horrendous.For the price you expect better all around perfomance as well as customer service."
2,Does Not Work With a MAC-,"THIS is an amazing camera- BUT- It does not work with a mac.. you can get the files to the desktop, but the sound is separate.. trying to splice the sound back to the video is next to impossible. (and I'm a mac geek..) I bought some software from some Japanese site, claiming to translate the MPEG2 format but it was basically a joke.. Apple has a $39.00 MPEG2 plugin for QT that should work, but it did not.. Basically DO NOT GET THIS IF YOU ARE ON A MAC.."
4,One helpful tool,"I bought the 2000 edition. I used this. Being highly adhd I didn't make time to do it properly but played it in the background while going about my daily life. It did make quiting smoking easier. It didn't make it crave free. I think the conscious mind yells ""you are full of it!"" to overly positive programing or affirmations. However, I believe the subconsious mind does work with them to make changes. Like I said it worked for me. I have been smoke free for 3 1/2 years and not going back."
