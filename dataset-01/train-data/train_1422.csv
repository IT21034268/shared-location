3,"Stiff & Bulky, but functional - much darker gray than shown in photo","Auto Expressions sheepskin steering wheel cover is a dark charcoal gray, not the light medium gray shown in the photo. Also very stiff and bulky, but should do a good job of protecting delicate fingers from temperature extremes. Reasonably priced and functional.Auto Expressions 381106-35-01AX Grey Sheepskin Steering Wheel Cover"
4,Does it job!,Keeps hands cool when needed and warm when needed. Have not had it long enough to know how durable it is going to be.
1,pure garbage,"I would give this 0 stars if possible.I bought this to replace an actual sheepskin wheel cover that I have had for 2 years. My old dirty one is 20 times better than this piece of garbage. The polyester fluff, or whatever it is, is not that soft, not very thick, and not even uniform - not at all like the picture.Don't waste your time or money. Buy the worst one from the gas station instead and it will be better than this patchwork of scraps.I'm considering just throwing it away for the satisfaction..."
4,Sheepskin Wheel Cover,"A great steering wheel cover! I just wish it went just a little further ""around the wheel. You find yourself falling into the ""gap"" between the sheepskin all too often."
2,Constantly twisted and did not stay on the steering wheel,"I have bought many sheepskin steering wheel covers in the past, and none of them acted like this. It kept twisting and would not stay on the steering wheel. I should have returned it, but I kept thinking it would get better as it stretched out. Never did. :-("
5,Wonderful sheepskin steering wheel cover,I love this sheepskin steering wheel cover. It keeps my hand warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
5,They all grew!,All the seads that i planted grew. Im not sure if all the seads are the same yet. I will have to wait till summer to find out.
1,horrible,"nothing grows, just mold and stink. don't waste a dime! complete waste of effort. greatly upset our kids, who are studying desert systems"
1,Very disappointing!,"Delivery was quick. Directions easy to follow. I thought this would be a good long term project for my daughter. Very disappointing! The plastic material for the base and dome is cheap. The base bends easily even when filled with material. I would not let my younger child move the greenhouse because of the flexibility of the base. The dome top is very difficult to remove. We did get a few ""buds"" to grow after a long, long time - like nine months of waiting. After the buds appeared, the growing stopped. It was difficult to see the buds with the dome, so the dome had to be removed to see the buds. However, because the base was flexible and the dome difficult to remove, my 10 year old daughter could not do this herself. I don't believe it is worth the money. I will get another windowsill greenhouse but not this one."
1,Desert Hothouse,"Great mechant; fast delivery, but very disappointed in product. Nothing ever came up. Not a total loss though, use the dome to germinate seeds in peat pots."
1,LDS Church not -- as this book claims -- neutral on evolution,"Contrary to its title, Mormonism and Evolution fails to comprehensively provide ""the"" authoritative LDS statements on evolution. It does provide some of them, but other statements are included that don't meet the book's stated criteria for authoritative status. The result is that individuals who want the LDS Church to be neutral on evolution will be enthusiastic about this book. Those, however, who just want to know where the LDS Church stands on evolution should be wary of this book.For more information, click reviewer name and follow the ""Web page"" link."
4,Great voice in sci fi,"These dystopian stories are very reminiscent of tales that were common in the Galaxy, Amazing, and Fantasy & Science Fiction magazines of the 60s and 70s. These seem like a 'best of' of those years. Some are quite moving, others disturbing -- but chances are you'll not forget many stories in this book even long after you've read them."
1,Don't Buy!,"These cards are marked in such a way that you could tell one card from another, making them a poor choice for most card games. Maybe for the children to play Go Fish..."
3,Not water resistant!,"This is a great watch and I loved it until I jumped in the water, less than 1 meter in depth, less than 30 seconds in the water and the watch quit. ""Water resistant to 50 meters"" is misleading. I would buy again for the heart rate monitor but make sure to stay out of the water."
4,A great starter HRM,"I was looking for a basic HRM and this one fit the bill. It has five zones that match up closely to calculated HR zones that can be found on the internet. It has a zone alarm if you go below or exceed your training zone. The strap is very comfortable as it the watch. The timer is basic as is the Recovery feature.If you are new to HRMs or trying to find a decent one without a huge investment, this is a good place to start.I mainly use mine to keep myself in a fat burning zone (zone 2) and work on my cardio (zone 3)."
2,Very limited use.,"This program has a very limited number of designs, and will only make calendars until 2010. There are no updates available. Not really worth the money."
5,Exellent service and condition of book,"I received Jewish Days and Holidays, now out of print, within a week, and the book was in ""new"" condition! Our three children were raised with this book, and now we've provided a copy to all three, for their children. Summary: excellent service, superb condition of book."
4,Nice for the price,"Long battery life and a good mix of flashing modes available. Mounting choices are pretty flexible. Would prefer a black body, but I painted it and it is well into 200 hours of riding with the original batteries."
3,A good Black sleeper 3.5 stars,"This is the kind of movie that you don't expect much out of. Which I will admit I thought when I first heard of this movie. Denzel playing a jamaican cop?, Robert Townsend playing a dreadlocked outlaw? Yeah, right. But, I was in for one heck of a suprise. First of all denzel is great as always playing the overworked officer and Robert Townsend who really wasn't that bad at playing a dread lock. Throw in a few cameo's from some real west indian actors and add a touch of M. Emmett Walsh and you have a nice little thriller. Not quite citizen kane but still entertaining. And not a bad way to spend a saturday afternoon."
5,Highly recommended,"""Mighty Quinn"" features a young sexy Denzel Washington (Xavier Quinn) as a smart detective who did a stint with the FBI and returns home as police chief on a Carribbean island. There's a shadowy plot involving $10,000 bills, a guerilla movement and guns, but the movie focuses more on Quinn's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder, and Quinn's own discomfort from having ""made good"" but ending up caught between two worlds, white and black. He's also caught between the islanders' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation. This film is full of sexy island women, colorful reggae music, and real world dilemmas of race and identity. No matter that we couldn't quite figure out if the plot hung together. A winner!"
1,Terrible,"When I went to play this DVD it wouldn't even start due to a ""Region"" format error on the disk. I ordered the the movie brand new and tried playing it in 3 different DVD players and got the same message. I was very disappointed."
4,Why do I love this movie? I just do.,"Silly, enjoyable, life-affirming confection set on an unnamed Caribbean island. Two friends on opposite sides of the law are all the excuse that's needed for a colorful series of adventures. The location photography, the editing and the music are great. Schenkel directs a perfect cast of actors with a light touch. Don't think about this movie -- just watch it."
5,"A ""cult-classic"" movie if there ever was one!","Like some of the other reviewers, I have seen this movie countless times. Based on the novel 'Finding Maubee' it weaves a richly textured mystery/drama. Throw in the lush setting of Port Antonio, Jamaica and a lively reggae soundtrack and you have the perfect escape vacation movie. Just pop this movie in, grab a mixed rum drink, and get ready to be transported. Top notch performances are delivered by EVERY actor and actress involved. There's just a genuine ""feel good"" element to this movie that makes you want to watch it again and again. Strangely enough, it is still a little known and little appreciated piece of movie magic. Don't miss out!"
4,Delightful!,"I happened to see this movie late one night on cable and found it to be wonderful. The movie presents Denzel Washington early in his career. As usual, his presence on screen is great to watch. In the movie, Washington is a policeman in Jamaica. It is a light movie that it is entertaining and great to relax and watch. There were some scenes that made me laugh, and I felt a little bit more happy and relaxed after I watched. So, if you just want to be entertained, this is a great movie."
2,dated and insipid,"Each epidsode in this stitched-together book is so flat and tepid that the book as a whole doesn't even really manage to be episodic. The reason this book is famous is because it was the first to deal openly with gayness. Nowadays, you can watch TV and see questions about famous gay people and events on game shows, for crying out loud. This book is so dated, it's not even funny. And none of the characters come alive, including the narrator. If you want to read a good book about this same sort of milieu, check out Hubert Selby Jr.'s ""Last Exit To Brooklyn"". If you're gay and you're desparate to find traces of gayness in the media, I suppose ""City of Night"" will satisfy you for a day or two."
4,Undercover of the Night,"The only context in which I had heard of this book was as the inspiration to the Rolling Stone's song ""Undercover of the Night"". Thank you, Mick Jagger, for having good taste in literature. The book was a fascinating journey not just through america, but through the life and mind and soul of a young man whose life doesn't match that of the norm. Rechy's writing really lets you understand in depth perhaps not reached before. A masterpiece!"
1,FULL of typos,"Every page. The letter I becomes the number 1, I'll becomes 111, I'm becomes I'rn. This whole book needs a MAJOR proofreading. You'd think on a site like amazon.com there would be some quality control."
3,City of Night by Rechy,"A cult novel is good, no doubt. I expected it to be more violent/kinky, but it is not. It is told in a nice way that things actually happens around the main character but most of time he is actually somebody who just allow things to happen and the other are telling/hassling around him. You are there and nowhere. At the end writer are losing his touch to book and it becomes too philosophical... But it is anyway worth of reading."
2,Overblown and Vacuous,"I can understand the literary frenzy when CITY OF NIGHT made its debut... Courageous author breaks cultural barrier with unflinching look at gay subculture. Rechy's prose sure fits that era's highfaluting lit style -- overwritten, stream of consciousness, uncompromising, ""deep"", etc. Highly esteemed by cultural sophisticates, chichi media, and undergraduate college professors as a ""classic"" -- in the same mold as ON THE ROAD and FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS. I remember having to suffer through this type of pretentious drivel during English 101 classes, but with CITY OF NIGHT, I had a choice -- and couldn't finish 100 pages.Self-indulgent prose, unlikeable characters, empty plot lines, overwrought/meaningless monologues, metaphorical nonsense -- I gave it two-stars only because it took a lot of balls to come out with such a depressing slice of your life."
3,inhuman punishment,This movie is really bloody and a lot of killing. I would and figured an old and distinguished actor would not have taken the role.
3,NEED A RABBIT SLICER,When OH WHEN will the Hutzler company quit screwing around with bananas and give the people what they REALLY need: a Fresh Whole Rabbit Slicer!!!!!I am counting the days.
5,Nature's Candy,"Ted Nugent turned me on to this years ago. We were having roast marmoset with duck-stuffed hog, when he brought out this tasty treat. Sun-dried and salt-cured, it makes the absolute quintessential backpack snack for those long excursions when one needs to hide in the forest for extended periods of time. The bonus in all of this is that there is absolutely no buckshot to pick out of the meat, which makes it a huge time saver! I think they would probably do well to include the tail and maybe the entire pelt as an extra bonus treat, in case one of the kids wants a really cool hat to show off at school. All in all, it beats having to trap or shoot), kill and skin your own rabbit, unless you're into that sort of thing. Or if you're Elmer Fudd."
2,"Looks fairly lifelike, but fails to function as a rabbit","When i received my rabbit, i was impressed at the likeness to a real rabbit, but after closer inspection was disappointed with the lack of features. First of all, the 2 AA batteries were not included, and considering the price i payed for my rabbit i would have expected a pair. The mobility options are very limited, being able to move only by holding the rabbit and moving it around in a rabbit-like manner. The noise capabilities are non-existent, no sound was heard even after poking quite hard.All in all i was not impressed with this fresh whole rabbit, in the end all i could do with it was cook it and eat it."
3,It arrived dead!,"When my bunny arrived, to fill that gaping hole in my soul since my gerbil ran away, I was so excited. I had purchased a wonderful hovel for Prince Hoppy (yeah, I know it is a cool-ass name). I was literally tearing up with joy when I ripped the box open...only to be horribly scarred when I found my new bunny DEAD IN THE BOX! This has ruined me for fluffy pets for life.Where is the quality control? I mean, the bunny was not even fluffy, but looked more like a kidney lying there.Still, kind of a cute little guy I guess and easy to take care of. That's the only reason l gave this three stars."
2,Product not as advertised,"Well, I can't speak for others who may have had a different experience, but myFresh Whole Rabbitdid NOT arrive whole. No head, no entrails, no paws. For just a few dollars more I could have purchased a fully intact one at my local pet store. Granted, I did go with the ""Buy it Used"" option, to save a few bucks, which may account for some of the wear-and-tear. Buyer beware."
5,An excellent deal!,"This gave my magic act a much needed ""Edge"". I know doing things just for the shock value is kind of cheap, but hey, it's just a kids birthday party.The hat kind of smells now, though. Perhaps I will invest in taxidermy."
3,Not a very good product. Too crunchy..,"I ordered some whole rabbit last wednesday and it arrived today at my house. Needless to say, I didn't find it tasty. Sure, you can make it into a soup along with some chopped carrots and onions, but it still tastes like leather and the texture is too crunchy like old cotton paper. What a waste of money. I've tried tastier dead rabbits at Carl's jr."
4,Delicious!,"But unfortunately there's only one way to eat a brace of coneys. Good thing I had lots of Po-TA-Toes! Boiled, mashed, stewed and fried to a crisp!"
1,Beware Buyer: This Rabbit Comes DECEASED!,"I bought this thinking it would make a wonderful gift to my neighbor's young son. Ordering was simple, and delivery was flawless. So you can imagine the shock and awe not only on my face, but also my neighbor's 3-year-old son, when he opened the package to find a DEAD rabbit.When I contacted Cloverdale about this issue, I found myself on hold for hours listening to John Tesh: Live at Red Rocks. After 3 hours on hold, I was asked to leave a message. Wait 3 hours and leave a message??Suffice to say, I have not heard back from Cloverdale. Look closely people, nowhere on the page does it say that this rabbit comes DECEASED. To all of you looking for a fun pet, do not be deceived by Cloverdale's deception. This rabbit is NOT alive. It is DEAD."
2,A Morbid Thought,Whoever put the picture of the cute bunnies as an image of the product has a macabre sense of humor. I got a kick out of it.
1,awfully expensive for a rabbit,"while i admit i was amusing myself with the other reviews....in all seriousness... this is VERY expensive for a rabbit.i know a lot of people who feed their dogs raw meat and for animal food (for dogs, or large snakes)you can get whole dead frozen rabbit quite cheaply. in addition most big cities have a place that sells fresh rabbit and etc for far less than this rated for human food.while rabbit is always going to be more expensive than ""common"" meat for human consumption.. you can get it far less expensively than this"
1,Not What I Ordered.,"It was cute, but I didn't realize it would be dead. It's cute in a dead way, but it's simply not what I ordered. Unfortunately, the seller is requiring me to pay return shipping. Looks like this little bunny will be hopping back home! Or not..."
3,Whole Rabbit - NOT!,"I ordered one of these Fresh ""Whole"" Rabbits, but when it arrived its head, fur and insides were missing. Not exactly whole, I'd say! Maybe it was just damaged during shipping, but I won't be buying another one. I mean - without the long ears, how do I know it even WAS a rabbit? It was the same size and shape as a cat...not that I've seen a cat with its head, fur and insides missing. I mean, not like really close or anything.On the plus side, it was delicious with a tall, cold glass of Tuscan Milk, so I give it three stars. That's three WHOLE stars, BTW."
2,Don't make the same mistake I did...,"For the love of all that is decent, do NOT choose the ""Buy It Used"" option. Just trust me on this one.(Written from my hospital bed)"
1,It's Dead!,"I bought this for my kids since they wanted a bunny for Easter. I remember getting a bunny when I was their age. So I typed ""Rabbit"" into the search function here on Amazon and ordered this and opted for the optional gift wrapping. Imagine the look on the faces of little Jimmy and Suzie when they opened this up on Easter morning. They cried the whole day and it really made the Easter Egg hunt a downer. If you buy this product please understand that it is dead. It may have been alive when it was first packed but the box didn't have any holes in it."
1,Too much blood,"I've been a rabbit eater for most of my life, used to shoot my own but as I get older, I've been ordering online. When this arrived, I was quite excited to get my slow cooker going and have a great stew, however when I opened the package, there was at least 8 cups of blood and intestinal type matter with the carcass. I went ahead and cleaned it up and everything worked fine but I cannot recommend this product as it's a pain to clean the body up before cooking, my preference is out of the bag straight to crock pot without having to deal with blood and guts....guess this is what happens with age."
1,"Definitely not ""fresh"", homeboy!","I ordered this whole rabbit believing it would be ""fresh"" as described. However, upon opening the package it became clear to me that, in fact, this whole rabbit was not fresh, nor was it dope or funky or in the least bit on the one. It could not rhyme. It had no fresh beats. Where's it's Kangol and slick silk suit??? It was definitely not FLY! I demand a refund!"
1,Animal cruelty,"When I was a wee child, both of my parents passed onwards, and baby sister and I were taken in by a band of rabbits. Momma and Daddy always managed to find the best food for us, until one day, the sun rose too high and Daddy was shot by Farmer Joe. Farmer Joe worked for Le Village. My daddy's on someone's dinner table now!Ever day since then, I have boycotted Le Village... And Farmer Joe... And the when Momma died by Snake poison soup, I assumed the role of patriarch of our Rabbit clan, beware I, King of the Hyraces!"
1,Ella Weez is not a fan!,"I bought this Fresh Whole Rabbit for my stuffed rabbit Ella Weez and she was not pleased. The price was right, but Ella found it to be in bad taste. After a little coercing I got her to accept it and let it sleep in the bed with us. The only problem is that it didn't stay as ""fresh"" as I thought. We had to toss it out of the bed after a few days, and get new sheets."
1,Rabbit's Hole Not Fresh,I was distraught to discover that the rabbit's hole seemed to have been removed. Will be exchanging this for a fleshlight.
1,There's a hare in my rabbit,"I'm not sure where to begin. Truth is I'm a big lover of rodents, lesser marsupials and some mud fish but this product has caused considerable difficulties--the psychological/emotional trauma alone has turned our lives upside down (my husband is undergoing a psych evaluation as I type this). Lucky for us our kids were with their grandparents when the box arrived at our home; out little Didi was not so lucky.People may find all this funny, but a hare had been intentionally wedged inside the carcass of the rabbit we purchased--there were clear signs of forcible entry. We know this for a fact because last year we ordered a moose and there was a hare in that too.We're considering our legal options and advise purchasers to consider carefully these reviews before purchasing ""whole rabbit"".Respectfully,Ariel Warren-Thumper"
5,Elmer's Revenge...,"To who it may concern:As you know, there is a serious affliction that has decimated a large number of short, white, bald, republican men in America, yes I am talking about Fuddite Syndrome, the inexplicable development of befuddled and slow-witted mannerisms compounded by an unusual consonant - mangling speech impediment. The unfortunate victim of this disease has, for many years, been ostracized by society, forced to hunt their own food, and fallen prey to tricksters and merry-makers, especially the so-called wascally wabbits of the world.The time for the Fuddite has finally arrived:DEATH TO THE WABBIT, DEATH TO THE WABBIT, DEATH TO THE WAAAA BBIT.heh heh heh heh...."
2,Pay attention to the description,"In my excitement at thinking I'd found the perfect house for my pet bunny, I was horrified to discover that I'd mis-read the description - this isn't a ""fresh rabbit hole"" as I first thought!Please take more care when describing items Amazon. I threw this carcass into my bunny's hutch and the horror in his eyes will stay with me always.It's hollowed out insides do actually make a nice snug bed for my hamster though, hence the extra star."
1,Please...not under EASTER,"please - this this is a big oversight, this should not be under searches for Easter / Easter Bunny. How horrible."
1,Are you people freaking nuts?!!!,"Do an Amazon search for ""Easter"", and what comes up, in addition to the nice Easter movies and such? A skinned dead rabbit. Are you people on crack?!!!! I'm sitting here browsing with my kids looking for a couple of Easter DVDs and this is what they see? Wake the hell up, Amazon!!!!"
1,PEOPLE!!!,THIS IS A RABBIT.THIS IS A DEAD RABBIT AND YOU ALL HAVE THE NERVE TO WRITE COMMENTS ABOUT IT!HONESTLY. I THOUGHT PEOPLE HAD MORE DIGNITY ON THE INTERNET.
1,IS THIS A SICK JOKE?!?,IS THIS A SICK JOKE?! What the hell with the cute bunny pictures... I'm absolutely appalled. Disgusted. I don't know what else to say.
3,Has Anyone Seen My Pet Rabbits?,"I left them with a friend who works at some place called ""Le Village."" They have black and gray fur and are easily tricked into small dark containers.Also, one of them has swine flu."
3,Not quite as good as quail for duping evangelicals with oil-rich land,"I was going to use this Fresh Whole Rabbit as part of my hunting ruse to dupe the poor bastard I ripped off at the Sunday Ranch, but I settled on quail instead as it seemed more a plausible ""game"".I gave it to H.W. as a going-away gift instead.P.S. Did you get the game pun? I have a sense of humor, you know!"
3,Wish I'd found this before!,"Back in December, the men from the Baptist church I attend got up stupidly early to go hunting. They brought back their catch (4 rabbits and squirrels) for the ladies of the church to skin and cook over an open fire. The ladies carried wood from the nearby woods, skinned the unfortunate rodents with their bare hands and we waited three hours for the meat to cook. Because everyone who attends the church was invited to eat at the church, and 4 small critters don't feed many people, a lot of people left the church sad and hungry. Now that I know about ordering meat from Amazon.com, our problems are solved! The men can sleep in, the ladies are saved the effort of removing fur and entrails and there will be enough food for everyone! Awesome!"
1,Not Kindle compatible.,"Unfortunately Amazon sent me a Fresh Whole Rabbit that was not in the Kindle format. When I tried to load the Fresh Whole Rabbit into my Kindle for some nice, relaxing, late-night reading... well, it's kind of gross now and my Kindle won't power up at all. Wouldn't have this problem if I'd gotten the Sony..."
1,Not a plush toy!,"Imagine the horror my son felt as he unwrapped his Christmas present to find this bloody carcass instead of a plush toy. It is NOT fuzzy although it is pink....sorta. More like a greenish red color. There was a stench too!Now THIS after Hostess took away his twinkies (Amazon has been wheeling & dealing in $500 a box Twinkies, so they must be in cahoots with Hostess). This has contributed to his anxiety, which means MORE XANAX to tone that boy down. Very very hard for a 42 yr. old boy to deal with! He did say, however, that it DOES taste like chicken. An icy cold glass of Tuscan milk makes it perfect."
3,So Much Fun! But...where do you put the batteries???,"Rabbits have been a ""must have"" for single women everywhere and almost all of my friends have one. Well, normally rabbits are upwards of $100+ dollars! Although I've heard they are SOOOOOO worth it, I could never afford one....UNTIL NOW!! I was so excited (literally) to find one under $50 that I could barely control myself as I whipped out my credit card. I opted for express shipping and then countered that additional cost by selecting a 'gently used' one! I was tingling with anticipation all day and rushed home to find my rabbit waiting on my door step. I quickly grabbed the package and dashed to my bedroom while tearing off clothing as fast as possible. I launched myself onto the bed and rip open the package and...now I can't figure out where to put the batteries!"
1,nasty surprise,"I was bloody excited when this arrived. After de-boning, I used my Hutzler 571 to slice the very tender meat, and then braised in Tuscon whole milk for a few hours. It smelled great, but then when I went to devour the dish --- there was a hare in every bite.Gagged for a day. Sending the leftovers back for a refund."
2,Fresh Whole Rabbit NOT alive,Fresh Whole Rabbit was DOA. After calling Cloverdale customer service the matter was cleared up. The fresh whole rabbit was supposed to be dead. They let me send it back for a full exchange but I only wanted an alive animal in return. Ended up with a bunch of rabbits' foots instead \;
1,rabies,"Instead of fresh whole rabbit, I was shipped a dead rabid raccoon stuffed with dead moths. would not buy again."
1,Why?,Don't waste your money on this when you can get them for free out in your own backyard or where ever.What you really need to do is buy this bookRabbit Hunting: Secrets of a Master Cottontail Hunter (Outdoorsman's Edge)and whatever you what to shoot them with.
3,"""Whole"" does not mean what you think it means","I wanted a rabbit for my magic act and this seemed like a good deal, but it's kind of hard to pull a bunny out of a hat when it doesn't have any ears! The one time I did manage to get it out everyone thought it was a guinea pig. Sending it back :("
3,Not a house rabbit,"After I found out that petsmart doesn't sell rabbits, I decided to look online for house bunnies. I know that rabbits can be kept indoors, and they can even be litter trained! I enjoyed my first few days with my new pet. He had a calm disposition and didn't even chew on anything (even though I was warned that rabbits chew a lot). We cuddled on the couch and watched movies like Fatal Attraction together. After about a week, I noticed that he started to smell really bad. I had to put him outside because the stench was SO terrible! I feel awful about keeping him in the back yard, but what else am I supposed to do??? He hasn't run away yet, so I think he's OK back there. Anyway, long story short, this is not a house pet.I gave this item 3 stars because I really love my pet rabbit and he doesn't cost a lot to feed. The only problem is the smell..."
4,"4 stars for taste, 0 stars for being a rabbit.","Tasted delicious but it was a baby pig. I understand if you cut off the head and fur you think I won't be able to tell. One word, hooves. Dead give away of a knock off rabbit-pig. Probably Chinese. Never again."
5,I rate this item DELICIOUS,"What is undervalued in the sale pitch of this item (and it's overall sense of delight while you sun-bathe on the car-port covered in at least six of these freshly delivered delights) is the wonderful ""SPAK"" sound it makes when you throw it to the linoleum."
2,RABBIT OFFER,"First of all, I want to make sure this is really a rabbit. Skinned cat and skinned rabbit look exactly the same, except for THE FEET. Where are the feet??? Lastly, I want to know if this is a city rabbit or a country rabbit. This is very important because city rabbits eat out of trash cans, grave yards, and those kinds of hideous places. IS THIS A CITY RABBIT OR A COUNTRY RABBIT????"
2,"What, no chocolate!?","Every year I enjoy one or more delicious whole rabbits during the Easter holiday and they are not only tastier but better to look at than this... thing.Besides, by taking off the ears the seller has deprived the buyer of the best part."
3,Never buy a rabbit with out the ears on.,"My grandmother always told me:""Never buy a rabbit that does not still have its ears on; they are trying to sell you a cat.""Words to live by.Minus one star per ear."
2,Funny but now solidly built,"I looked for this cribbage board specifically because we used to own one and thought the toilet bowl design was funny. I ordered it for our son. I ordered another style at the same time and totally like the other one much better. This one came to us with a flimsy hinge. It feels like to won't last long, doesn't seem well made at all. To return it was going to be a hassel as it was from an outside company so we went ahead and gave it to our son. I just hope it lasts for a good few games. I would not recommend this product. I would look for the other we purchased... one that opens up to told a deck of cards with an eagle etched on the outside... that one is beautiful, and well built and I know will last for years and years."
4,Favorite Whoopi Goldberg movie,I don't know what it is but I really like this movie. I am use to seeing Whoopi in comedy roles but this is more dramatic and she pulls it off pretty well cool movie.
5,Whoopie and Billy = two good movies,You can relax and enjoy Whoopie and a great supporting cast and Billy Crystal is always a sure bet for a good laugh.
3,Love you Whoopi,Whoopi Goldberg's movies are always off the beaten track. I just love that about her. Keep up the good work.
5,love whoopi,i absolutely love whoopi goldberg this movie is a classic i forgot how funny she was when she was younger still is but man she was out of control when she was younger
2,Only works with some devices,"It worked fine with my mouse, wireless adapter and USB drive. It did not work with either of my external hard drives which both have 2 USB cords, one for data and one for power so clearly it doesn't carry enough juice for the hard drives. I have a spider type adapter that works fine with all my devices and it was about half the price so I'll get a few more of those.I also had a hard time squeezing my USB drive in next to another port so the ports are just a little too close together.It installed itself without any issues and is nice and compact so it may be ok for some."
4,Does what it's suppose to do.,I plugged in this USB Hub and it worked instantly. The only issue is that the ports are a little close together and it becomes harder to put multiple flash drives.
4,usb Hub,"This product is very easy to use, Just plug it in and the item drivers load and your ready to use. I rate this item very good."
5,Finally the BEST product I ever bought for the price!,"It's really small and light weight with (4) ports! I just used some of the double stick foam tape squares from the loccal hardware store to stick it to the underside of a shelve close to my monitor and keyboard, hooked it up, rebooted and 100% satisfaction. A couple pieces of freezer tape to stick the wires up under the shelve that can't be seen and I am happy!!! The only thing is that the USB connection cable supplied is only 3 feet long (1 meter). I had a USB extension wire laying around so that worked out just fine seeing how my PC is on the floor. Small = good in the PC wiring world. Save the space for monitors, Keyboards and toys."
4,great value for the price,"bought this mainly because i have an older pc where all the 2.0 usb ports are in the back of the cpu. the ones in front are the slower ports. i wanted the bring the faster speed to the front so i can easily connect my flash drive to a faster port. i also wanted to free up at least one of the back ports for my printer. the only drawback is i wanted to connect both of my portable hard drive's usb connections thereon, it wouldn't work because the drive needs two separate 2.0 connections. this is a minor drawback; but, good for anyone looking for a product like this for that reason."
2,Not even worth a footnote.,"This is a terrible cookbook. The two stars are for providing nice background information on the countries as well as selecting appropriate recipes.What else is there? You ask? Adaptation. The recipes have all been adapted to the tastes of an American palate of the 1970's. Items I have never even seen in a traditional Bulgarian kitchen such as whipping cream and cornstarch are used in recipes. Sour cream is used as a substitute for yogurt. Revolting! These don't make Americanized versions of recipes (such as making Banitza with cream cheese instead of soft Bulgarian cheese) they just make a mess! Why bother making an ethnic cookbook at all if you're going to ruin things?There are much better books on this same Danube travel and cuisine theme. The Blue Danube Cookbook by Maria Kozslik Donovan, is one of them but I'm sure you can search out others."
4,Interesting,"This was a very exciting book to read, with non-stop action. It was a little difficult for me to follow at first, because I had never read this type of material.What I would really love is some real life visualization of this book. I highly recommend ths book, but must say bring your imagination if you have never read this type of materialI would like to thank the writer for all of the imagination and creativity in this book."
2,A little slow,"The writing was good, but the story / plot was just slow to develop. I had to give up after 55% through."
5,Giving sf another chance,"I thought I had read all the sf/cyberpunk worth reading when I picked this book up off a going-out-of-business sale. I was drawn into Williams world - complex, believable, character-driven - and surprised that I could be surprised. I read others and it wasn't a fluke."
4,Character psychology in the world of cyberpunk,"Following the advise of a friend I entered the world of cyberpunk with this book and have been hooked ever since. More than the mastery displayed in the understanding of how new technologies can change the society, I particularly enjoyed the character developments and the fine psychology analysis. Cyberpunk is not solely defined by the use of geeky terminology and fuzzy references to corporate dominated social organisations, cyberpunk also refers to human beings and their adaptation to a near future environment.Advise: read Voice of the whirlwind, a near sequel which takes place in the same universe and time frame as Hard wired.I rate it 9/10."
5,A core cyberpunk book,"This is absolutely a top-notch cyberpunk book, one of the defining works of the genre. It covers societies from desert smuggler pilots to urban street dirt to orbital corporate mindfreaks, and the tale of the future's dwindling hopes comes across clearly in all of these. I have this on my shelf next toNeuromancer, and keep reaching for Hardwired."
3,Feels dated,"I just couldn't get into it. Before you purchase, I suggest reading a lot of the pages available thru Look Inside."
2,Grim story,"Cowboy delivers goods and messages, girl kills people - Orbital (in sky) manages events and people on earth. Others may like this book, but it is not for me."
2,Just because it looks like and sounds like...,"...cyberpunk doesn't mean it is cyberpunk. Walter John Williams uses all the archetypes of cyberpunk fiction - mind-to-machine interface, powerful corporations with money superceding national sovereignty, criminals as the 'good' guys, cybernetics becoming intimate with the human body, and such - but that doesn't make this a cyberpunk novel. Its like painting stripes on a horse and calling it a zebra.It is a good story, and the characters are compelling, but it is also very clearly written in imitation of a cyberpunk story. Part of this stems from the contrived 'future-tense' narrative style, but that's just the best example of the overall 'contrivedness' of this story. Cyberpunk doesn't have to be about futuristic technology at all (see William Gibson's ""The Gernsback Continuum"" and Greg Bear's ""Petra"") so long as it carries the cyberpunk sensibility. ""Hardwired"" doesn't do that. It imitates a cyberpunk story."
1,Tim McGraw 2003 Calendar,"what can i say, this caleder pails into the darkness compared to last years. a photo of his hand? is this art.? i thought it was as if someone had smuggled a camera into a concert/photo shoot and got snap happy. i was very disapointed."
3,Could be better Timmy,I thought it was a fairly good calender because it is Tim McGraw. I would not buy this calendar though because the pictures could be better and the calender did not impress me very much.
4,The bars are very fulfilling and make a ...,The bars are very fulfilling and make a great snack. Not really sure how great they would be for weight loss but they taste good and are satisfying with a glass of skim milk! I'd certainly recommend these for a healthy snack or a quick meal on the go. I think these are better than other types because they don't leave an aftertaste and they contain mainly natural healthy ingredients!
5,The absolute beginners cookbook,"Love the absolute cookbook. Easy, tasty recipes for everyone. Good for beginners and experienced cooks alike"
2,Beginner cookboook,"I was disappointed in this cookbook. I ordered it for a teenager who wants to learn to cook thinking it would have step by step instructions. But it's basically just another cookbook. There were a few recipies I might use, but not many."
1,You think the movie industry doesn't allow any genuinely awful films to be made these days?...,...think again.You HAVE to check this one out.
5,This will make you love Christmas a little more,"Typical smooth Cetera sound covering some holiday standards and a few bits of new material. The band sounds good and not over powering like you tend to hear on some Christmas music. I thought everything blended together quite well. Really like the new material. Can actually visualize ""the thing that santa claus left behind"" changing colors. Hopefully his new material will be part of the ""old standards"" by the time my kids grow up. Okay Peter - time for Cetera's Christmas part 2."
5,Cetera hasn't lost a step,"I tend to not buy Christmas CDs from rock/pop stars as the singing and production tend to be kitschy. This one is an exception, and it's exceptional. I saw Peter last night on his ""Christmas Tour 2004"" performing songs from his Christmas CD at Border's Books. His voice still gives me goosebumps, he was funny, gracious, and was obviously having a good time.I highly recommend this CD."
3,A must for Peter Cetera fans,"It's a bit slow to start with but grows on you. Some of the traditional songs are a bit slow for my liking but the titles that he composed himself are very good, addictive to say the least. His version of Jingle bells is a nice pleasant change. My favourite has got to be 'something that Santa Claus left behind' He should have released that as a single. It has pride of place on the shelf next to my copy of Chicago 25. This is a Christmas album which will be played every year."
2,Only has a couple of good cartoons,"I didn't like this DVD ... I enjoy the black and white Popeye and there wasn't too many of them on this disc. I never did care for the color Popeye, and this is mostly what is on this DVD. I gave my copy away to the Library and bought the black and white Popeye that is from 1933-40. Must better DVD."
4,Brooklyn's Essential Head Music,"Sunz of Man drop the knowledge over very strong production by two of the Wu Tang Clan's most skilled beatmen 4th Disciple and True Master. These brothers have made classics for the Clan on WT Forever, Meth, GZA, Ghostface and Killarmy's albums. The best mind expanders here are Illusions, Cold, and Intellectuals featuring a caliente verse by Raekwon. Sunz's rhymes speak on street and spiritual issues. Since 1998, this has been one of my favorite albums."
5,Sunz of man takin' it to another chamber,"Add this one to your wu-tang collection. Best cuts are: Natural High, Illusions, Shining Star etc. Dirt Dog gets props..(Shining Star)..Best work by Big Baby in a while!"
4,Quite a surprise,"The Sunz have a very unique style, sort of sing-song. The difference in their voices make them shine. One thing that seperates them from the wack mc's is their dope lyrics. These guys can drop some illmatic mentals. Check Next Up (with a show stealing Meth), Illusions (Masta Killa never dissapoints, here he is razor sharp), and Intellectuals."
4,good start,I bought this cd and I thought i was going to be impressed and im overwhelmed. The Sunz of Man have good rymes and flows. This album really has alot to offer. The best track is Shining Star and Intellectualls. If you like Wu-Tang style of rap buy this cd.
3,"Please, please, please start using one producer per album!","Don't get me wrong, this album is good. Sunz of Man are the best MC's in the Wu-fam, outside the core clan, and the beats are good. It's just that the spread of producers prevents a ""sound"" like the older wu material had. (See Raekwon, ODB, and Meth, and more recently, Killarmy) Rza, 4th Disciple, True Master, Supreme, and Wyclef are all capable, there are just too many of them. This album takes to a new level this problem that's been evident on every relaese since Forever. Some great tracks shine through, however, like Illusions f/ Masta Killa, Cold, Next Up f/ Meth, and Intellectuals f/ U-god and Raekwon. The lyrics are good, but for me wu's always been about the beats, and this album would have been better if they had just picked one producer and let him give the Sunz a sound."

2,I had this,Cd for about 6 years and only listen it about 3 times I just cant get into it its ok for true down to earth Wu Fans but I just like the main group.
5,Fits 2002-2003 Nissan Maximas and 2002-2004 Infiniti i35s,"Installed on my Infiniti i35, these high quality rotors have an ecoating that will protect against rust and discoloration. They are double disc ground and have a crosshatching surface for greater brake bite. These rotors have a nice linear braking feel. and you don't have to step so hard to engage the brakes. Couple these with some low dust brake pads and you'll have an awesome setup that will last long, stay clean and perform great."
4,..brainless entertainment..,"..you just can't take this thing serious. It may have a then-unknown Tom Cruise in it, but..LOL..u can't take him serious either. Points on for Shelley Long: she was and still is one of Tinseltowns most underrated sexy actresses. Bonus points for a somewhat wired (but hilarious) Jackie Earle Haley, prior to his jumpstarted acting career as Rorschach in THE WATCHMEN.."
3,rEVIEW of LOSIN' iT,"california teens decide to go to Tijuana to look for sex and find plenty of trouble, Stars tOM cRUISE AND sHELLY lONG. Somewhat entertaining."
2,Sent wrong book,"The book ordered was not sent. It was supposed to ba a hardback book that was pictured, but a softback was sent."
3,A very helpful/faithful walk through the use of icons,"As a protestant, praying with icons is not natural for me.But as a lover of art, and an appreciator of Nouwen, I am very thankful for this book.It is a worthwhile read and a welcome addition to my collection."
5,It's Nouwen again...,"I've never read anything by Nouwen that I didn't like. I have been to Eastern Europe several times, and each time, tried to purchase an icon or some religious artifact to remember my trip by. I had seen Orthodox Christians praying with Icons (not praying to, mind you...praying with), and wanted a better understanding of the practice. Nouwen writes that they are to be used like windows into heaven, not as base objects to be worshiped. Nouwen actually takes several icons and explains the meaning behind them (such as the empty space at the table in Rublev's ""Trinity"") in order to help the reader learn to focus on certain aspects of faith. Offers clarity to the practice of praying with icons. A good companion piece to Linette Martin's ""Sacred Doorways""."
5,A Spiritual Gem,"I first read this book in the late 80s, just before a period of return to the Catholic tradition of my youth, and I was reminded of it this past Sunday while gazing at stained glass windows in a local church.The book is a wonderful introduction to Christian iconography, from a spiritual master and healer. In addition, it is very effective as a first step toward sitting and gazing as a spiritual practice. Indeed, sitting, and seeing, becomes a profound experience of prayer in itself, and Nouwen's little book will be appreciated by those seeking a retreat from the agitation, clamor and distraction of daily life."
5,Behold the Beauty of the Lord; Praying With Icons,"Exactly that for which I was looking; a small yet mighty book by a favorite author on a subject of great interest. This is well thought out, the icon's researched, studied and as understanding and spiritual insights were expanded, adimiration grew and the icons became treasured and loved. The author shared his inspiration and explanations with warmth, wisdom and clarity."
3,fair action film,ok julie strain film. but beware an unrated version with about 15 more minutes is around. try to find that version. the cuts in this movie are evident. just when something steamy is going to occur the movie abruptly cuts to next scene...overall good action.
3,Julie The Queen,"I got this movie because I like Julie Strain movies.If you like Julie Strain movies then you'll like this movie.Overall, the most dissapointing part of the movie is that it doesn't have enough action, or Julie Strain kicking butt. And, I would have liked to seen her in a better outfit also. The outfit on the front cover isn't worn in the movie--darn!The acting was O.K., but needed to be a little better.The break out star of this movie(DVD) is Eva Dawn Nemeth as Pricilla, but unfortunately she doesn't have enough screen time.The part that makes this DVD worth getting is the half hour close up of Julie Strain, as she's just plainly interviewed at her house...that's the best part. Julie seems...well at home there.Maybe she'll do a sequel, and get a better costume, and have some more action in it; that's what I'd like to see."
4,Queen julie,"I am a big julie strain fan, and if you are then you will want to see this movie. The plot i not stong and there are alot of holes in this tale of a future earth that was devistated by a comet resulting in a sort of second ice age. We don't really know how the bad guys came to power or why they want to experiment on the sewer peopl but we do know that Julie is a high class call girl by day and the avengger of the sewer people by night. This is an above average Sci-Fi B Movie with all the elements, Mad Scientist, Bad guy in love with the heroine and the child that unleashes the maternal instinct of our hero. There is a fair amount of nudity as is common in this kind of movie but not as much action as one would expect and just not enough Julie. over all it is a fun watch."
1,Julie gives u a tour of her house,"Here's the only reason to buy this movie:The DVD has a 30 minute interview of Julie where she SHOWS YOU THE INSIDE OF HER HOUSE in Bervely Hills. She also talks about her life, past movies, future plans, and how she got her career started in Hollywood.The movie itself is quite bad. A few topless sceens of Julie, and a couple of cheesey action sceens. My recomendation: Use the money to buy her latest book, JULIE STRAINS GREATEST HITS."
1,Worst Film Ever?,"It's hard to beat PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, but this super turkey comes close. Pure garbage. Even Julie Strain's enormous assets (none of them related to talent) cannot keep the adult viewer's attention for more than a microsecond (teenage boys may be exempt from this). The budget is non-existant. The same sets are used again and again and again, and look more like poorly made high school drama backgrounds than anything approaching real. Yes, Julie is repeatedly nekkid, but she has no acting ability whatsoever, and it is painful to watch her and all the actors struggle through something more resembling trash can refuse than a screenplay. Hopelessly, impossibly bad. And yes, not a single ""battle queen"" to be seen anywhere! Watch at your own peril!"
2,brain freez,"I love Julie Strain, because she fun to watch and has a great body for a B film actress.This film is not the best production it's very sloppy looking and that's because it's very low buget.Julie Strain is not a very good actress she has a limit to what she can do.The film it self don't have a plot that's meaning full, the action in the film is totaly not there no body tries to write a good scipt no one tries to put a good action scene in this damm film .If you are going to buy this on 'DVD"" just buy it for the great body of Julie Strain."
4,Excellent and Glad to Review!,I originally purchased this product as a gift for a friend from Anthropologie and I am glad to see it is not a unique as I first thought. It has great color photographs of almost every cupcake and is entirely devoted to cupcakes! The recipes are easy and simple and I would highly recommended this book for cupcake lovers and cake decorators.
3,"Nice pictures, shame about the recipe","This is a very attractive little book, and I was eager to try out some of the recipes. But as other reviewers have said, there are only a couple of basic recipes, and the one for vanilla cupcakes, while it is very simple, doesn't produce much flavour and is rather heavy in texture. I have to say I was having my doubts about the recipe while making it, but thought I'd give it a try anyway. I am known for my baked goods and when I gave these cupcakes out to people, they looked puzzled after eating them, and even said they weren't my best efforts! Anyway, the actual decorating ideas are very cute, I would use those, but just use different cake recipes for the cupcakes themselves."
3,"fun, but not ideal","My fiance and I, together with a friend who co-owns a bakery, tested a few recipes from this book in preparation for our wedding (we're making a variety of cupcakes in lieu of a traditional cake). We were quite disappointed with the cupcakes themselves. They had a nice texture, but were lacking in flavor.Our friend, who has lots of experience working with chocolate, attempted the white chocolate icing. It was extremely tasty (especially on strawberries), but it was just too lumpy to serve on a cupcake.The icing for the wedding cupcake recipe was delightful, and we will certainly be using that for our wedding. We also really like the creative decorating ideas throughout the book and anticipate trying some of them for birthday parties and such.If you're looking for fun ideas, then this book is for you."
3,Cute Cupcake Book...Same as Fairy Cakes!,"This is a cute cupcake book. Several simple cupcake recipes. Creative decorating ideas.However, this book is the same as Fairy Cakes, which seems to be the UK version of this book."
2,"My wife liked it, not so much myself",This should perhaps be reviewed by those under 13. I bought this for my wife's nephew. My wife got a lot of pleasure reading the jokes. I myself thought they were too corny for my tastes.
1,Not funny,This book is not as funny as my initial expectations. I was dissapointed beyond recognition
4,Second Timex Ironman Trialthlon 30 lap watch,The second Ironman I purchased is even better. The plastic wrist band is plastic(I can't wear metal)fits my large wrist with 2 notches to spare.The previous one had a strap that wouldn't go around my wrist and I had to buy a separate larger strap.The numbers are easier to read with black on white contrasting very well. The price compared favorably with one at Walmart.
1,Gaps abound,"I was so looking forward to receiving this and another cd of Lilias's that I ordered at the same time. I had read so many good things about her. Her voice is as gentle as everyone says, and her cueing is clear. But the production is incredibly bad. There are loooong gaps all over the place, the sequencing on the cd does not match the listings, and all this leads to one experiencing a total lack of serenity :("
4,Lilas Discover Serenity:,"The cd is great, easy to follow. The quality was good and the delivery was right on time. Like her books and cds her style of yoga is gentle and yet challenging. Great for the beginner and older people."
1,Me no likey,"The thing was just too small, way smaller than I expected. I wasn't too please with this item at all. Good for a little kid"
5,Heartbreaking but awesome,"Rei pretends he's over breaking up with Kira, but he ends up deciding he loves her while he's out with someone else. Drama ensues, and Rei and Kira are given a chance to get really close..."
3,Needs Photographs,The book is good but the sketches make identification very difficult for the layman. I should have gotten a book with photographs. The book is virtually useless to me.
5,This title fits!,"If you're a fan of this seminal blues rock band, this book tells their story and puts all their songs and records on one place. I like it because it gave me a better understanding of the various albums produced of the group. I wanted to collect their body of work, but with so many different albums, I needed something to make my selections. This book is it!"
4,A Lot of Fun,"Read this book from cover-to-cover in a day. Now that we're getting more perspective on this period, as we get older, the ramifications of this band are pretty astounding. In my mind, the Yardbirds were better than the bands that their three superstars spawned, but I'm not so sure what the ramifiactions of the band was when they were active. Eric Clapton, JImmy Page and Jeff Beck, however, re-shaped rock n' roll.This book is so detailed, but without a lot of commentary, that it leaves one to draw conclusions about the band to themselves. Well worth a read."
4,I'm a fan of the Yardbirds,"Greg Russo did his homework, and I could tell he's a big fan of the band. He even helped put together the ""Little Games and More"" CD. I especially liked the section on the four former Yardbirds guitarists, (didn't know before I read this that Anthony Topham was the original guitarist). The inclusion of the Yardbirds' concert dates was also helpful."
3,Not quite what I was looking for.,"I found this book more difficult to follow in my attempt to do creative writing on my own. I felt it lacked enough example poems. The exercises were inconsistent, as they seemed to come from some very different teaching styles. Many of the exercises just seemed so goofy that I didn't even bother with them. I would much more strongly recommend ""In the Palm of Your Hand"" for the same purpose."
5,These exercises are terrific!,"They tunnel into the imagination, from dark places to inner and outer journeys. They include exercises for several poetic forms I hadn't discovered. The group exercises, with a little finagling, can be used for lone desperado writers. I'm definitely hooked."
3,Exercise for the Sake of Exercise,"This book was recommended in other poetry books I've read, so I thought it would be good. Although I'm not a big fan of writing exercises as such, I'm not opposed to them on principle. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't relate to the exercises in this book: they never spoke to me, they never came alive for me. Possibly you have to be in a certain frame of mind to engage in these activities -- sitting at a desk in a college classroom, maybe."
4,Very good book,Very helpful book for those beginning with poetry writing. Good explanations about poetry in general and the different styles with exercises to help you learn to write. Recommended.
5,Extremely Handy little book!,"This book is wonderful on many levels. You can use it to improve your own craft, to challenge yourself by undertaking the various exercises it presents. It would be great if you're planning to teach a poetry course or workshop or if you attend an informal poetry group. It will also help those who just can't grasp poetry to make better sense of the craft."
4,Tear 'Em Up!,"I remember sitting in a dark theater back in '71, gobbling popcorn, slurping coke, and seeing how many Milk Duds could fit in my mouth, when suddenly, ""Willard"" began! I was 9 and nothing could have prepared me for the treat I was about to see! ""Willard"" is the story of a social outcast who has a crazy mother, a total creep of a boss, and no friends. He finds some rats and becomes close to them instead. Ben and Socrates (the white rat) are the standouts. Willard (Bruce Davidson) befriends his furry pals and teaches them lots of tricks. Everything's great until Willard takes Ben and Socrates to work with him. He hides them, but they are discovered. Willard's creepy boss (Ernest Borgnine) kills Socrates. That's when things get ugly! Willard unleashes his rodent horde on his boss, telling them to ""Tear him up!"". It's all downhill from there, as Willard goes increasingly insane, and Ben rises to turn the rats against him. The end is great and spawned the sequel ""Ben"". A classic..."
4,"""YOU MADE ME HATE MYSELF!"" WHERE IS THE DVD RELEASE?!","My memories of 'Willard' are far better than the movie itself. Growing up in the 70's who could forget the great poster from this movie?(which I am lucky enough to own)the creepy trailer(which is scarier than the film) and an incredible and eerie performance by Bruce Davidson, which is too good for this lovable, but sub-par film.If not for Davidson, Borgnine and the rats this movie would be a bad TV movie of the week! Regardless, I have fond memories of this film and I would like to see it released on DVD! I would buy it and I know I'm not alone. Where your nightmares end.....Willard begins!"
5,THE ORIGINAL IS ALWAYS THE BEST!,Although it's hard to compare he remake featuring CRISPIN GLOVER to the classic original with a very young BRUCE DAVISON (X-MEN) I have to say the original is truely better.The newer version is definately a modern telling of the tale and also contains a bit of the sequel in it.. (elements of BEN) and is definately creepierBUT you definately have to see the original to truely understand the impact is has on the remake.Did I make any sense.. oh well we're talking about a movie where a guy names rats and becomes friends with them.. get over it..BUY THIS WHILE IT'S THERE!
5,Easy and gentle way of exercising made it encouraging to go on..,I found the DVD to be of higher quality than most. Dr. Lam is to be congratulated on such a perfect product. I am so happy with the product that I'm recommending it to all my older friends.I have ordered the next one up: Tai Chi for Beginners. I'm sticking with Dr. Lam.
3,Okay - plus,"I found the book to be a bit disappointing. I liked some of the anecdotes, which reminded me of my time in Malaysia, but the recipes aren't entirely to be trusted. There are recipes with - I presume - typos that indicate for example ratios of rice to water that are just unbelievable so that if you followed them you'd end up with a dish that is practically inedible. There also are dishes with ingredients you won't be able to find anywhere outside of Malaysia. If you know what you're doing, this is a useful resource and in many ways an interesting read. If not, there are more reliable books out there."
3,Not what I expected,"I suppose I expected something called an ""anthology of reflections"" to take on exploring the events of 9/11/73 from a wide range of stories by a wide range of witnesses. What I found instead is that this is a very narrow slice of accounts, mostly from the spouses and friends of a couple of well-known Chileans: Beatriz Allende, Joan Jara, Matilde Neruda, etc. The bulk of the pages are transcripts of Allende's last speech and Castro's speech; both are important in context of the time, but not really ""reflections"" of the day. (I consider Castro's speech more a political maneuver than a personal reflection or statement.)In short: an interesting book, but I was really hoping for stories from regular many ""regular"" average people, not just from a handful of the famous and celebrated. The time line in the back was probably the most helpful part of the book for my project."
5,Amazing moisturizer!,"I first tried PCA 18 Clearskin moisturizer about a year ago. The most incredible part of this product is that while other moisturizers seem to ""sit"" on top of your skin; PCA 18 Clearskin you can feel going ""into"" your skin. I would not have experienced the difference if I had not tried this product. Smooth and soft skin without a greasy feel. Thank you PCA!"
5,Refines the skin without stripping it,"I have very sensitive skin (pale, freckled, prone to wrinkles and scarring), and after two kids and many sleepless nights, my skin was looking a bit battered. This product worked well to gradually brighten and clarify my skin tone without harshness or drying. Other products have reddened my skin or irritated it to the point where I was having to use multiple moisturizers to mitigate the effects (ProActive really did a number on me), but I would recommend this product to anyone else struggling with similar issues."
4,I can't go without,"This stuff is great. It doesn't dry out my skin, it doesn't have harsh chemicals. I wouldn't say I have acne, but I get really big pimples once in a while I get lots of black head and other little zits. My facialist turned me onto Clear Skin and I love it. I realized that Amazon is cheaper then buying it anywhere else. This keeps my breakouts at bay."
5,Good for oily/acne prone skin,I like this moisturizer it is light yet effective. I have acne prone skin and I can use this w/o suffering breakouts. I highly recommend this entire line for acne and/or pigment challenges. I use this as my evening moisturizer and use the oily skin sunscreen/moisturizer in the mornings. Although if you have a separate sunscreen you can use this during the day since it is light.
2,POW Camp Lunghua,My mother was interned in this POW camp for 3 years. The author of this book was only there briefly and saw very little.
5,"were exactly as pictured, exactly what we wanted","we purchased these party hats for a sponge-bob themed birthday party. these hats were exactly as pictured, and exactly what we wanted. classic cone-shaped party hats for kids with some elastic taped to it to slip under their little chins. they arrived quickly, good price, couldn't ask for anything more."
2,Geometry Workbook,I don't believe this book was very helpful. No answers in book or explaination of problems. Shipment was quick.
1,review for Geometry: Practice workbook with examples,nowhere does the description mention that the text is required to understand what is going on in this workbook. I believed it to be a standalone and it is not. It was a tremendous waste of my money and time and I feel cheated!
5,Geometry workbook,"Wonderful price .Fast delivery. What more can you ask for. I have told numerous parents about purchasing their kids school books from Amazon.The process is fast,easy and reliable.Your site will be our 1st stop when purchasing books in the future. Thank You !!!"
5,Great quality.,"All Gingher products I have used have been first rate, and last a long time beofre needing to be sharpened. I bought new because my daughter needed the old ones."
4,Great sissosrs,i was looking for sissors for a new sewing basket gift I was preparing for my granddaughter who is soon leaving the nest. They are perfect for clipping the threads and sized great for the basket.
3,Not for men,"I needed these scissors not for embroidery but for HO-scale fine modeling work. They are exactly what I wanted, except that because my thumb is a lot bigger than those of most ladies using the scissors for embroidery, to have any control I have to jam it into the loop so hard that it quickly becomes rather painful. The only solution I can think of is to cut the loop at the back and spread it open far enough to accommodate my thumb. It would be nice to have scissors like this available that are better suited for men."
4,Great Scissors,Love these scissors. They are small enough to carry in my craft bag. And you can't go wrong with Gingher accessories.
3,Evidence Bible,"The condition was almost like new. I've not used it yet, but expect to get out of it what I wanted. But...I was expecting it to be more or bigger than it is."
5,Excellent Read!,"Praise God for Ray Comfort's duty to bringing Truth to the world!I bought this for my best friend for his birthday and he is excited to start reading it.If you are into science and truth-seeking, this is a great read for you :)"
1,NOT for thinking minds,"This book contains Ray Comfort's opinion on many matters. He bends the scriptures to suit his own beliefs. As an example, on page 170 (Matthew 5:44) he attempts to validate executing people and does not mention Jesus' very clear directions not to avenge e.g. Romans 12:14,12:17, 12:19Unfortunately he is also inaccurate and makes untruthful statements about science and scientific research throughout the book, for example about geology and dating of fossils. And then despite supposedly discrediting carbon-dating in previous arguments he then uses carbon dating to validate the Dead Sea Scrolls.This book is full of personal opinion pretending to be fact and is not for a thinking mind. It's Ray Comfort's distortion of Jesus' teachings."
5,Always neglected,"The greastest aspects of the book, is the fact that the Law is brought back to its purpose, lead people to Christ ( Galations 3:24 ). The use of the Law has been entirely neglected but Ray Comfort does a wonderful job in bringing this important message back to the believer. This bible answers many modern questions that a Christian may be asked, like how can God be so wrathful if He is all loving? Ray also teaches how to witness the way Jesus Christ did, by using the Law (Ten Commandments). He teaches us how to confront people without the fear of being asked questions we can't answer, and why would we, God doesn't give us more than what we can bare. I recommend this book to all Christians, new converts or not, this book is entirely important."
5,Excellent work !,"Pastor Ray Comfort has hit the mark with the evidence bible. In it you'll find: a practical and biblicall way to present the gospel, answers to the most common objections to christianity, how to preach open air, prove God's existence, quotes from popular figures and from well known evangelists etc... This bible has given me a new zeal and how-to to preach the gospel. The great commission is every bible believing christian's duty and this bible helps you to carry out that call, every christian should get this bible!"
5,OUTSTANDING resource,"Excellent resource for Bible study and witnessing. Informative, fact filled,crisp design and appealing graphics/illustration make this pocket size Bible invaluable to any serious Bible believing Christian or even an honest non-Christian who is seeking facts and scientific proof for the hope of Christianity and the truth of Christ's resurrection! Ray Comfort and his WAY of the MASTER series use these materials. Kirk Cameron is seen on National Television using this Bible to great success. A real blessing and an outstanding value!"
5,Excellent description of NYC Transit System,We enjoyed this video very much. It is perfect for learning about the NYC transit system. It is very informative and a must see before visiting the city. It demystifies the transit system and does an excellent job of incorporating all the necessary information to get the traveler ready for successfully navigating the transit system. I would recommend it to everyone.
3,Its OK,Ok but not great...gave me some good tips but still confused about the NYC subway and its navigation. It goes too quick and not enough details. It would be nice if it were comprehensive
1,waste of time - not by someone you would like to model.,"Besides being very rude John La Tourrette has been known to be very arrogant to people. He likes to call people ""stupid"" and ""ignorant"", especially to those who have even slightly different views than his. A very sarcastic man. Do you want this person to be your teacher or role model? Very obnoxious.Doesn't seem like someone who is very happy with his life to be treating people that way. Either low self esteem, or mr grump doesn't apply what he teaches. Or, what he teaches is wrong."
4,An absorbng read,"Thank you, Ms. Gellis for another good read. I truely enjoyed the book and the historical information included was a real treat. I am looking forward to what you do next. Thanks again!"
2,Book was not in the condition that was advertised,I was not happy that the book was not in very good condition as was advertised. My son who is almost two was very happy though and I guess that's what is important. I would appreciate that statements of products condition would be more accurate.
3,Ok,This a good book but not what I was looking for. Needing something more focused on maternity and postpartum.
5,Protection at its best,"After having a very bruised hand from catching fastpitch balls, I needed something to get me through our season. Took it right out of the bag and felt immediate relief on our next practice. This is a must for anyone catching baseballs or softballs that have a little heat behind them. Wishing I had this from the start of the season."
5,Always seems like the perfect family.. great for even todays youth...,Partridge family still remains good clean innocent fun..and holds up its age age well..by clothes even hair really not too bad...just some interior shots like the Kitchen..show the age..
3,Gift for wife,My wife grew-up watching The Partridge Family. Got this as a gift to show the kids what we had on TV growing up.
3,Where's Season 3 & 4 ?,"C'mon Sony! Where is seasons 3 & 4. This lovable show deserves to have all seasons out by now. The music is great and I am waiting for the episode where the Partridges go to a cabin for the weekend and get stuck because the road gets washed away and Rubin says something like ""Great--I'm stuck here with Danny and his Tijuna Knuckles."""
4,Good buy,"This side light, made in Korea, seemed to be of a lighter material than the Honda light it replaced (96 Honda Accord) - but it fit perfectly, looked basically identical, and worked fine. I did not use the 2 bulbs that came with it as my bulbs were working, so I can't comment on the brightness."
1,Combat toy,"This toy did not hold together at all! However, when I contacted the company, they sent a replacement of a different toy. Kudos to the company."
3,Thought it would be better,"I have other Bamboo products, and I thought this would be just as good, but I was mistaken. We have two Jack Russells that chew through all their toys until I found a couple of Bamboo products that they still have to this day in one piece. I guess they make some out of different grades of material."
4,Flying Cow - Holy Cow!,"I've owned all these bamboo combat toys. The flying cow is super. My chewer laughs at the sight of plastic frisbees - but flying cow is soft on her mouth and flys great! The other chew toys are very, very good. After awile they do get chewed open ,BUT are the only toys I've purchased that don't end up in the trash after a day - I replace them about once a year or so which is pretty good."
2,dog toy,Even with all the hype of it being made with ballastic material my dogs had this ripped open and the squeeky out in a day. Granted my GSP's are relentless when it comes to opening up any toy I buy but I had high hopes for this and it did not live up to them.
5,Sing Me a Story: The Metropolitan Opera's Book of Opera Stories for Children (Paperback),"It was wonderful. Wished I'd had it when I was at school. I was a librarian. Children these days need a broader background in culture. I used the opera Aida (which is in ths book), with books, history, music, authors, and illustrators. They can learn so much when you teach it from all aspects."
4,Ridiculous bass,"The Alpine Type-R subwoofers kick like no other. They are accurate, loud, and they have the ability to shake the rear-view mirror of the car next to you, and move your own."
5,Type r,Great sub. i got it to replace an old JL that ive had for about 8 years. its connected to an alpine MRP 350 about the same age. and this thing hits hard makes the whole truck shake. it is a little bigger than the old JL and made it a little hard fitting it in a truck box. but got it in and fits behind the seat in my standard cab mini truck.
1,Rip-Off,"Wow! Alpine really blew it on this one. Had it hooked up to a infinity reference mono, pushing 457 rms. The sub is rated at 500 rms, but after 2 weeks the sub fried. Got a replacement, and what do ya know, second sub fried. Now i have the amp hooked up to sony xplod 1300 watt, and bumpin with no problems at all.Overall, this sub is not worth the price tag, and everyone who has been in my car has said the xplod hits way harder than the type r did."
4,What's not to like?,"Six-year-old hitmen. Hermaphrodite soft-core porn. Death by acid. Stripper high school girls who fire darts from their you-know-whats. A North Korean assassin who flies into a killing rage over bad kim-chee. This early effort from autuer Takashi Miike is a totally uninhibited, exhuberant, blood-soaked low-budget mess, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't know why. Most people probably won't like it."
3,Fudoh: The New Generation DVD,"I was surprized by the plot twists and the violence. In reading the film discription on the package you say, well this might be an interesting action flick for a slow Friday night...It is much more... To turn Machievelli into a young Japanese Yakuza with an atitude is one thing.... To give him a gang is another...The depiction of violence is graphic, so the faint of heart stay away. The use of sex is mild in some places and rathergraphic in others. This is not a porno flick, but some aspects may offend the anti S/M crowd.I think there is a genre for this kind of modern behind the scenes look at what it takes to rise in a yakuza family, what it is I don't know. I'm glad we just have the Mafia here in the U.S., right?"
3,Streetwise Word Map,"It does not provide Daylight Saving changes, and too small IHMO (I needed the wall map). But rather nice if you really need such kind of ""pocket map""."
2,"Disappointed. Buyer beware, fool me once, etc.","I should have read the other reviews. I am very disappointed in this map. Didn't realize that pocket sized meant it would fit in your pocket whilst unfolded!!! It is only now that I see that the dimensions are listed very far down in the ad. Buyer beware, I suppose. Also, it is NOT laminated. It is merely on glossy card stock, meaning the edges will still become frayed and gross. Luckily, it is for my little one whose eyes are not yet bad, so maybe she will not need a magnifying glass to look at it. I also have a laminator and may go ahead and laminate it myself, even though that will eliminate the folding possibility. I have a map of Florida (where I live) that is truly a ""laminated, fold-up map"" and I love it. So, I honestly believed this would be similar. If that is the kind of thing you are looking for, then do not buy this."
4,RealEstate in 2000,"I've read This book so much its all worn.. so I am getting a new copy! Monica Reynolds writes from the point of view of BOTH a realtor AND an assistant, provides and invaluable wealth of information into this little paper back that has given me the confidence to take my Real Estate Busines to the next level!"
2,Boring,This album could very easily put me to sleep. It's missing everything good about the first two albums. Good night.
4,I use these to hold hookah tobacco!,"Instead of using these to hold beads, or craft supplies, I use these to hold hookah tobacco whenever I go camping, since the tobacco has to be in a pretty tight container (Its gooey stuff). Hookah smoking is a very traditional middle eastern and south mediterranean custom, and involves smoking a combination of fruit, honey, molasses, and a *wee* bit of tobacco. I don't smoke cigarettes, but enjoy the hookah in social settings. Its very relaxing and chill, and keeping my flavors fresh is important to me. Banana, white peach, passionfruit, and chocolate!"
3,Repetitive,"While I found the characters and their lives of the time very interesting, I thought Ms. Stein's repetitive writing style was detracting. The continual retracing of ground previously covered gave this reader a sense of unnecessary bulk and filler that is more often found in the works of novice writers."
2,Interesting at first...but really drags on.,"I enjoy Victoria Holt's mysteries--they remind me of Mary Stewart and Mary Roberts Rinehart in that they're charming and romantic. However, this historical novel is neither. The protagonist, Elizabeth I's cousin and adversary, is annoying. She also repeats herself--over and over and over and over again. The book could be half as long if the repetitive bits were edited! I actually couldn't finish the book, which is rare for me, because I got so fed up with the totally unlikable characters.Try Holt's mysteries--they're fun. But this novel is just a bunch of drivel."
5,Fairy Tale sex...an amazing book!,"I picked this book up at the airport to have something to read and I couldn't put it down until I was done! The only problem was finding a place where I could read it ALONE.This is a wonderful collection of stories with iteresting and intriguing plots and characters...and, yes, lots of sex. I thought that any one of these stories could've been expanded to a full length novel, the characters were so well drawn. I think that's what is lacking in a lot of erotica. The sex is so much hotter when you actually identify with the characters.This is one I will re-read often and I think my husband will reap the benefits!"
4,This book is good!,Cruel Enchantment caught my interest. It's pretty good. Some of the stories of gooood. Some not so. But it was worth buying.
1,not one right note,"I bought this after reading the reviews here. I love good, well-written erotica and I was eager to add to my collection. But I found the situations to be extremely contrived and the sex to be bland. And I am sorry, a dragon may be mythical, but sex with a dragon is still beastiality. Not that I found it shocking, but I just don't find that it has any appeal. At all. I stopped reading after story number two. If I haven't found it arousing by then, then it is in the trash. Maybe if you are into fantasy novels (as in the kind with other worlds, elves, etc.) then you will find this to be to your taste. Otherwise, it isn't worth the trouble of reading it."
5,Strength in Love,"This is certainly a girl group I miss. Even though they started to get as over-exposed as Beyonce' is now, they were more real. I never really love a singer or unless you feel the pain or emotions in their music.""Don't Let Go"" is a song you understand because of the strength of the words. If you have ever been in love, you know how the person who wrote the song feels. For me, it's timeless."
4,Pretty damn funny....and gory.,"I rented Evil Cult thinking it was going to be bad. And it was, but at the same time, it was hilarious and awesome. It never took itself seriously, and the gore was plentiful. Good stuff."
2,Wooden and Flat,"The Dreadful Debutante is not one of Marion Chesney's best books. Her books, especially the themed series, tend to be a little over the top in their heroines and plot, but that is part of their charm. The characters in the Dreadful Debutante were more like romance novel caricatures and the plot seemed to be filled with events that are supposed to be funny and exciting, but which are not because you've already read them in ten thousand other romance novels. Neither the heroine nor the hero kept my interest. Mira was immature, a little stupid, and pretty irresponsible. We are supposed to believe that these very characteristics are why the Marquess of Grantley falls for her. I would skip it - it's not very satisfying even if you just want a fluffy romance read."
5,Great light rock soundtrack,"This is a great soundtrack to a great movie. All the songs are great, you can listen all the way through without skipping. My favorites are ""Time"", ""E Is For Everybody"", ""On Your Own""...I love the whole album. I am so happy they included ""Molly Smiles"", a song that the character Molly in the movie was dedicated to by her dad. The movie was touching & really great & the soundtrack is just as good. I reccomend it!!"
3,Fun,"I originally purchased this album for the track contributed by the very talented Keram Malicki-Sanchez, and it ended up spending a good week or two in my cd player. It's not especially thought provoking or moving, but it's a entertaining, uplifting cd, and a great deal of fun to sing along with (if, like me, you're into that).Fave tracks: ""The Truth Be Told"" (Keram Malicki-Sanchez), ""Time"" (Chantel Kreviazuk), ""Slung Low"" (Erin McKeown) and ""Frightened"" (Toby Lightman)."
4,A journey through memories,"Many of us long to understand who we are, and where we come from. As a nation of immigrants, we struggle to appreciate the sacrifices made by those who made the journey to these shores, to understand what motivated them and what their life was like before they emigrated. I'm Irish, born and raised, but have lived in the U.S. for almost a decade so my perspective on this ""journey"" undertaken by the author in search of his parents roots is something I can easily relate to. I was initially disappointed with the earlier chapters in the book - they seemed to lack direction, were repetitious, and cried out for editorial direction but by the end of the book, I had realized that these are stylistic mannerisms of the author. The journey is less important than what the author learns along the way. Glimpses into Irish life are realistic, although tinged with sadness in places. Read this book, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Keep your expectations modest, and you'll enjoy this book.","That attitude is also, by the way, a healthy one to take to Ireland. While there, I was simultaneously reading Nuala O'Faolain's ""Are You Somebody? -The Accidental Autobiography of a Dublin Woman"", which may have been unfair to Gannon's book, since O'Faolain is a fantastic artist with the English language (as spoken by the silver-tongued Irish.) Gannon is nowhere near the writer that O'Faolain is, but his account is still touching in its simplicity and lack of pretension. Gannon is who he is, his parents were who they were, and his book is what it is. Accept that, and you'll have an enjoyable reading experience."
3,"Mildly amusing, wildly inaccurate","This book is mildly amusing but if any book called for a careful editor it's this one. It's got geography, history, culture all astonishlingly wrong. Irish as a Germanic language. Athlone 150 miles from Dublin. 1879 a Famie year."
1,No Plot,"This book is about money makes you happy, come on! Not worth reading! Let alone, buying..........."
2,Broadcast News Soundtrack,I am disappointed with this CD as it only contains the background music - no individual songs. I loved the movie but am uphappy with the CD.
3,Could have been more like the first. No NIN's :(,"I loved the first tomb raider cd. Though I was alittle disapointed when I heard this one. There are 5-6 good songs and the rest are a fly bye. Their first one had more hard pounding techno and the songs were also really good. But this one doesn't seem as energetic. It's still good, but compared to the last one, they could of put better songs in it. But if your a fan of techno and alternative than I would buy it. SO GO GET IT."
2,"Expected More, was dissapointed.","I bought this CD before seeing the movie, thinking that it would be at least a fabulous as the first Soundtrack. Unfortunatly there was very little of the original excitment."
4,song at the mall?,All I would like to know right now is the name and/ or artist of the song that was played at the high rise shopping mall in China.
1,Cradle of Life,"I was disappointed.The CD does not contain the really up, fast beat instrumental that was played nearly non-stop during the movie. The last track on the CD is the closest to it, ""Pandora's Box"".I bought the CD for the one song.....and it wasn't even on the CD.Why they chose to not include it is beyond me. Why would you do a soundtrack CD on an ""Action Movie"", and leave out the ""Action Music""."
2,Not as good as I expected it to be....,"I just thought that this soundtrack would have been a bit more electronica and techno instead of weak alternative. I feel like I am listening to a family radio station. While the whole album isn't bad, its just not up to par. Still a good listen for something different."
5,this is a great soundtrack,What a suprise!!! i usually hate soundtracks beacause there are never enough artists on a soundtrack that i like enough to buy. i bought this soundtrack because i have the soundtrack to the first movie and i liked it. i like the tomb raider series and thought what the hell. this soundtrack ended up being really good. the filter track the only way (is the wrong way) is actually quite good and i don't care for filter that much. most of the cd is a great mix of music. now some of the songs are types of music i normally don't go for but they work because they don't hold to their genere. instead most of these songs take thier genre they are classified with and break new ground. i love the song bad girl and heart go faster is also good. the only track that seemed weak to me was moby's. i guess i'm just getting tired of him. anyway this is a great soundtrack.
2,Music Question,SO glad you wonderful people could figure out Sinead O'Connor's song. Thanks. Now...can anyone figure out what the instrumental is that's playing in the scene where Lara and her man go into the mall business and set off the fire alarm? It's created for the film...but can we GET it anywhere? MAN! That music gives me a buzz!Thanks to all of you being so amazing with your knowledge!
5,AWESOME!,"Sonya! Oh I LOVED your book! It was so AWESOME, I couldn't put it down at all. Thanks so much for giving me a copy, along with the rest of us, the guys are reading it too (maybe quiz them next time we're there!) but anyways I just thought I'd tell you that I LOVED the book and I can't wait to read what's to come! Best wishes and love always!"
5,Indeed Left Something To Farming,"I recently read and thoroughly enjoyed ""A Slice of Pie."" It truly portrayed the life of a farmer. I have encouraged my friends to read this book. A Slice of Pie has indeed left something to farming and I'm sure Farm Aid is most thankful as are many, many farmers and ranchers."
3,A Slice of Life,"I found the novel to be beautifully written. It is a simple, heartfelt tale that will appeal to those with sentimental recollections of simpler times. A fresh, wholesome story."
5,A Lot of Heart and Hope,"This book immediately took me back to my small town roots. I relived my youth and early adult years through Sarah. From the high school years, the proms, the parties to first love and marriage the book read like a personal journal. It's an easy read with a lot of heart and a lot of hope. I'd like to read more by this author."
5,Heartwarming for the soul,"The work of this new author is to be commended.She wrote about what she evidently knows about - a rural town, rural people, the ""let's shake hands to seal the deal"" attitude small town folks are known for. After reading the book I had been drawn into the life of Sarah and felt the joys and sorrows she dealt with early on in life. You feel the pain and joys as you read. It's an honest, heartfelt work. I look forward to future works of this author, fiction or otherwise."
3,Okay reference for Diff Eq,This book was just okay as a reference for Diff Eq. I originally was looking for a text with more worked problems but this book takes the approach of utilizing computational software in conjunction with the text.
3,Passable at Best,"I found this book to be of limited usefulness primarily because it falls into the same trap that seemingly all math textbooks in the US have; over dependance on technology. Over and over again the author tells you to use the mathematic software package of your choice to explore slope fields of some equation. I really don't care about the slope field, maybe I will after I understand how to find particular solutions to nonhomogenous equations (which was not explained well at all imho). Overall, the text doesn't spend alot of time explaining things, and when it does it's not very enlightening. I found the problem sets lacking and the solutions manual wasn't much help. A much better book is the Dover Ordinary Differential Eqn book by Tannenbaum. First published in 1964 (iirc) it's a far superior book."
4,No Remakes....Finally,"After album upon album of Frizzell re-recording his best songs and not including his song versions with Shelly West on albums as of late, this greatest hits collection is very welcome. It includes all of his biggest hits and a couple of marginal tunes.I'll be honest and say that I bought this album for two songs: ""You're The Reason God Made Oklahoma"" and ""I'm Gonna Hire A Wino To Decorate Our Home."" I've heard most of Frizzell's tunes, but those two in particular stand out to me.""Husbands and Wives"" and ""Lost My Baby Blues"" are two hits of note on this disc. Also, ""Lefty"" addresses David's being in the shadow of his legendary brother.Get this album if you're a fan of late 70's/early 80's country before Nashville went and screwed it all up for us with people like Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, and those pop-wannabes like Faith Hill and her husband."
2,"Too much poetry, not enough useful advice","I did not identify with this book as I did with ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye."" Michelle uses a poem in every chapter, and not being a big poetry fan, I skipped right over them. (The ones I read were kind of cheesy). A lot of things she addresses I really don't have to worry about - She explains how women get whisked away by every man they date (and she inserts a poem to explain, of course) but I really haven't experienced that at all. The book seems to me to be a forum for Michelle to publish her poetry; and not a serious guide to real life Christian dating."
1,Not all that.....,I was very disappointed with this book. I feel like it was very poorly written. It was almost too casual for comfort. I also felt like it was elementary advice and not as scripture based. I would not share this book with others.
1,Nothing to get excited about,"I did not like this book at all. I am a Christian, but I do not like these kinds of books (hence why I have gotten rid of them). Ladies, the truth is this, there are tons of men out there that would be great for you. You just have to do what is best for you! You do not have to wait around for a man to pursue you - This is 2008, empower your womanhood. Unfortunately, I had to at least give this book a one star (required, I guess!?), but it really sucked."
5,Excellent!,"I stumbled across this book at a time when I really needed a friend to talk to who would understand my struggles with living single and living a christian life. Reading her book was like talking to my best friend who knew all my innermost secrets. Ms. Hammond's godly wisdom is awesome! I am finding peace and joy living single and sold out for Christ! And when I find myself struggling and becoming impatient, I pick up the book and read it again! Her biblically based advice and the study guides for each chapter have helped me to learn to value myself and see myself the way God sees and values me. I will continue to read God's word and everything Michelle McKinney Hammond writes! I encourage all women, single and married, to read this book!"
4,Interesting Reading,"I want each and everything the Devil has stole from me, and that is including my opportunity for a great husband that I know the Lord will bless me with!!!"
4,Read this as a new single,"I was 26 yrs old when I read this; fresh out of a hell bound relationship.Granted that now, I need more depth in my walk, but for those of you who need a foundation and direction and have little to no one to guide you, this book is FOR YOU!I mailed this book to another single friend after being blessed by it.Line up everything you read with the word. All knowledge/guidance/wisdom may not speak to your particular situation but don't 'throw the baby out with the dish water'! Glean from the book what you can. This book prepared my heart not to think as if I was an old maid, missing out on something great, but how to focus on MY King, Jesus Christ."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"After reading this book, there is som much to do with me that I don't have time to be looking for love from someone else."
4,Explosive Action Thriller!,"This is another one of Abbas-Mustan's big budget action packed suspense thrillers casting Bobby Doel and Prity Zinta. This movie is about a young man on a mission to find his father's killers who have become successful businessmen in Australia. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat as the story takes new turns as it goes on. Mostly filmed on location in Australia and New Zealand, it is beautifully photographed and shows mind blowing scenery. It's really good entertainment overall and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Cooling and calming!,This eye gel really does work! It provides a very nice cooling effect...great for the summer weather...and is smooth enough for everyday use. Puffiness and small lines around the eyes are less noticeable after use.
5,relaxing eye gel,"I've used this gel daily for over 3 years around my eyes. I don't seem to have any crows feet or lines, so I've got to think this has helped. I primarily use it for its cooling and relaxing qualities, but it smells nice too and isn't greasy."
2,R U out of your MIND???,$$$89.95 ????!!!You'd have to be crazy to pay this price!This was a good product at around $4.00. I have used it for years. and may have paid up to $8.00--but let's get real folks... I'd have way more lines spending that much money for this product than going without it!!!
3,Cukes Redux,"This gel doesn't do much for your skin, If it did, the limited supply might merit a premium price, but like most gels and creams it has become just another failed product.I did enjoy it, however, and I used it for years. I put it around my eyes and found it mildly refreshing. It was always worth what it sold for... a few bucks.Unfortunately, just paying quadruple for a discontinued product doesn't make it a better product.IT WAS DISCONTINUED FOR A REASON!"
1,This product sucks!,"I noticed that I have dark circles under eyes so I bought this gel. I used it a few times. Not only it didn't work on dark circles, it produced fat articles around my eyes. I guess it blocks pores. It's really bad. Don't waste your money and time to downgrade the skin condition."
2,Not the Trim I know,I have always used Trim salon board which is why I ordered the six pack. After a long wait to receive them I was very disappointed with the quality....they felt like the grit was just glued onto the pink base....it felt tacky and peeled away when I started to use it. I thought maybe it was just that particular board but when I used another board it started peeling away as well!...this has happened with each board and I've used three.They didn't come in a commercially wrapped package..just loose..I will continue to use Trim boards but will purchase them from a different seller.
4,keeps nails neat and *trim*,"Luckily I can find these locally because I use them often; this board has two sides, medium and coarse grit. They work great for pedicures on natural nails and it states on the package that they are suitable for use on artificial nails too. This grit is a little strong for natural fingernails but could be used in a pinch to take off a ragged edge here and there if you're careful. These are also washable - rinse under running water quickly and it looks new again.Pleased with this purchase and recommended."
3,Requested by our Son,"Book was requested by our Son, to be used in his work. Was sent as a present. Book was in good condition, and I am pleased with our purchase."
3,Okay,No big problem with this novel. It's an easy read and holds your attention fairly well. Might not read this author again though!
5,Great book!,"I'm a very picky reader. I hate reading anything that can not keep my interest, and anything that you can pretty much just guess the ending. However, this book was amazing!! It kept you on your toes. You never know who's at fault in this book, and its very interesting. It's very descriptive, and I love it!! I have already read this book, and I'm reading it yet again. Though I know the ending, I can't quite remember everything, as I read it about 2 years ago, and it still has my interest! I definitely recommend this book! Infact, I already have!"
2,"BEWARE, it is not the 1986 movie as listed.","This DVD is for the 2003 film released by Brain Damage films and starring Phoebe Dollar. It IS NOT for the 1986 movie of the same name, as listed.The 2003 movie contained on the DVD is pretty bad even for a B-Movie, so you might want to rent it first before buying it."
5,Great watch,"This watch is exactly what I was looking for: large display, date, time, and Indiglo for night time viewing.Only one small drawback. I don't like the tabbed band (supposed to hold the end of the watch in place), though this is not a real problem.Awesome, rugged, and RED and Black! It rocks."
2,Dixon REDIMARK Redimark Permanent Marker,"Very disappointed in this marker. I got a pack of 12 of them to label plastic bags and toys and keep in several areas of our home and office. It did a poor job, skipping or not writing at all. What did write on plastic toys, rubbed right off 1 hour later. I guess I'll go back to Sharpie."
5,WOW!!,"I got this because I was curious about the movie. It seems that the author who wrote this also wrote another book, Superstorms, that it says on the cover inspired the movie.I sat down with the Day After Tomorrow and it just plain swept me away. These books written based on movies are usually rank garbage, but this was created by a master, that is very clear. The writing just soars, it is moving, it is scary, it presents the characters as complex people, the descriptions are wonderful.Frankly, this book belongs between hardcovers. It should never have been issued like this as a knockoff book, even though it is based on the script. This is a completely enthralling and fabulous piece of thriller writing. And as far as the movie is concerned, after reading this, I would not miss it for anything."
2,After seeing the movie,"I walked into a book store the day after i saw the movie. I flipped through the book and whenever you saw a line, you knew who said it, where he or she was. It basically the movie with no facial expressions, and no jake Gyllethall. Of course, as in most action, destructing movies, the dialogue was ok, and this book accentuates it. What I did like about it were the lines that jake Gynthall refused to say during the filming of the movie becuase they were too corney. (His parents are screenwriters) Thank god Jake didnt say ""Darn, I think we are in trouble. My dad still hasnt gotten here in 4 days and my love Laura isnt getting better"". Who ever would say that in real life!"
3,Not as good as the movie,"This often happens whenever a book is written that is linked to a popular movie (whether written before the movie or after). It's just not as good as you expect after seeing the movie and experiencing its special effects and on-screen character reactions. One would do better to read Old Sci-Fi books like ""Ringworld"", ""Childhood's End"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" OR newer Cyberpunk High-Tech books like ""Neuromancer"", ""Cryptonomicon"", ""Mona Lisa Overdrive"", ""Prey"", ""Snow Crash"", ""Cyber Hunter"" and more. In fact, these books would make great movies."
1,Simply dreadful drivel,"Whitney Streiber, one of the chief instruments in dumbing down America, has outdone himself here. Streiber has no knowledge of physics or other sciences, but cares not a whit. In this extremely poorly written (lack of) effort, Streiber purports to describe a climatic calamity on the order of the recently lamented movie. It is amateurishly written, marked by no real single plot, and absolutely worthless as either literature or science. But people will probably buy it and buy into it, while books by real scientists, such as Richard B Alley, gather dust on bookstore shelves. Barnum was right. I weep for the future.I wouldn't even rate this book in terms of stars unless negative values could be used. Don't bother."
1,Why bother?,"Why do people bother reading novelizations of movies? Just go to the movie. Typically novelizations are exact replicas of the movies. The ""author"" (ie. scribe) is tossed some version of the script and told to churn out a book in time to get to the printers before release of the movie. The Day After Tomorrow is no different. And didn't this guy write Communion and claim to have been abducted by aliens in the '70s or something? (shrug)Again...just go to the movie. Save your reading time for original piece of fiction."
3,Functional EP,"Experimental leftovers from the OB sessions should only be worthwhile if you have, and love, all other material. Glass isn't bad per se, it contains plenty of moments worthy of the band's elite indie status, but contains more in-between uncertainties which do little more than sample a current palate."
4,Great Family Special,"If you are a muscician or just love great music, then you will enjoy this Awesome performance. He has one of the best big bands backing him up, but that doesn't take away from his amazing talents, he is spectacular! He also has some great guests on this special. Gather up the family of all ages and enjoy this great Christmas special."
5,Cue for Treason is truly a great book!,"I read Cue for Treason approximately 15 years ago as a 7th grade student in Canada and I loved it! Unfortunately, I didn't purchase a copy of the book at the time. I have been living in California for 14 years now and I've been searching for a copy ever since I moved here. No one seems to carry this book in the United States! It's the kind of book that you want to keep around for future children and grandchildren."
4,good book,"Cue for treason is a very good book because it teaches students how to recognise symbols! This is a very important part of English. This book is about Peter Brownrigg who is a son to a farmer in Lonsdale, Cumberland, England. It is a very fascinating book with many twists and turns. Kit Kirkstone is a ""boy"" who Peter meets on his adventure. They booth travel to london and then embark on a mission to save the Quuen . Geoffary Trease captures Shakespearian Engand perfictly,this book was published in 1909 and is still read today!"
4,"Great story, OCR edition hard-to-read","I loved this story as a kid, and wanted a copy for my daughters. However, the errors in this edition make it inapropriate for the children. The Product Description warns you that the original book was scanned and OCR'd, and to expect numerous errors, and this is absolutely true. Mistakes are common, particularly regarding punctuation. It's unfortunate that the scanned edition wasn't run through an automatic spelling & grammar checker, as many of the errors could have been corrected: Many words are misspelled, words are frequently pushed together (no space between them), words are occasionally missing. By buying this book, you can download the original PDF copy on their website."
3,"Could be a powerful film, but it isn't","OK, I admit I'm 100% white, as far as I know. But this film came off like a long lecture about how it's wrong to treat people unequally because they belong to a different racial group. I agree with that sentiment entirely--but as a story, it just wasn't interesting. It could have been very powerful, but it's a yawner. Although most of the actors are very good-looking, their delivery is wooden, and the dialog they are given is wooden, and plotwise it looks like they exist only to jump into bed with each other.I can see how people of color might be glad to see ""themselves"" represented in a film; just as I as a woman am glad to see literature and films that focus on women's viewpoints and concerns for a change.But other than that, I was so bored I couldn't even bring myself to watch the second half."
3,"Um...Okay, I Guess","I got this because it seemed right up my alley and I'm a bit of a history buff. I viewed this film before actually reading the book (which I never finished because I saw no point - sometimes a movie can be that powerful) and overall the film was okay, maybe even pretty good as far as entertainment goes. The acting was not the best and the back story on some of the characters, such as the protagonist's mother, seemed just thrown in for filler. I don't know if it was plausible, but it held my interest for a bit."
5,This is a great movie,Unlike some movies produced from written works this movie is true to the story line of the book. If you enjoyed the book you will love this movie.
4,fantastic!!,"This movie was excellent! It was directed very well, and all of the actors brought so much to this project. I look forward to the release of the movie. It is definitely worth adding to my movie collection."
5,Great movie!,"I loved this movie the first time i saw it. Ann Rice really does a superb job of educating us on the history of the ""Gens de Colour"" (Free people of color) in New Orleans and that whole origin of skin color & hair texture in the black community."
3,Admirable Effort,"I appreciate the effort that went into this movie, I am a woman of color and I grew up in the south. I love New Orleans so much that I new that it wasn't filmed there instantly, I just couldn't ever get into it. I watched in on Showtime a while ago and I tried to get into it, I live in Wisconsin now and it was snowing at the time, but I just never could really lose myself in the movie, the book, I devoured that in a day, being unable to rip myself away from Anne Rice's writing. It was a good effort, it was just a small cable network. I imagine if there was a larger budget there would have been more to draw viewers in. The actress playing Marie Ste. Marie was beautiful and almost exactly what I imagined.If you ever decided to do Merrick, Anne, please make sure they get that one perfect, I love her!"
4,I really enjoyed this one,"I read some of the other reviews and lucky for me, I've never read any of Ms. Rice's novels; otherwise, I guess I'd be disappointed to.However, I have read Joel A. Rogers' work: Sex and Race, which deals with the Balls depicted in this stiring film.When I heard about this film on Showtime and saw the previews, I couldn't wait to see it and I wasn't disappointed.At some point, I'll read the book and get more into the characters, but I have no idea when."
5,GREAT CD,"I WAS RECOMMENDED TO THIS PRODUCT THROUGH MY DAUGHTER. I WAS SURE I WOULD FIND IT ON THIS SITE, AND I DID. I FOUND NO FAULT WITH THE PRODUCT AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE ELSE."
4,Loved IT!,"I loved this movie so much, I watched it a second and third time. Which is something I seldom do. It gives the viewer some insight to the history of those with creole heritage. Definitely worth buying and watching. You will enjoy it."
3,skipper,the movie is captivating but the dvd skips so much you lose interest or fast foward past skipped/stilled scene and you have missed an inportant portion of story....sorry i chose this method...cheaper isn't always better
5,A HOT CD!!!!!,"This is a really awesome CD and movie. One of the songs that they show in the preview that cannot be found on this album CAN be found on Loreena McKennit's album, ""Book of Secrets"". It is called, ""The Mummer's Dance"""
4,Sweet Imperfection,"I was quite moved by this film; in fact, I've seen it five times! Fenton's score seems to tie in the 'modernized' aspects of the story to the time period in which it is set... Most of it is quite lovely, particularly the music during Maurice's homecoming, but some of the later chords are too melodramatic for my taste (such as the scene where Danielle's book is burned). These spots are few, however, and the overall effect is light and charming. Give yourself to the music as you listen, and the movie will play in your memory with all its emotional intricacies."
5,Relive the movie with this soundtrack.,"I saw ""Ever After"" four times before I realized that I had not bought the soundtrack. I loved this soundtrack instantly! Someone wrote that it was nothing like the movie, however, it follows the movie to perfection. Each track is titled and allows me to totally relive each special moment from the movie as it plays. George Fenton captures every emotion perfectly displayed by the characters in the movie. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a true lover of film and music."
1,not what i expected!!!,"i bought this cd because i loved that song they played during the preview of the movie. i was so excited when i unwrapped it, popped it into the machine.......boy was i suprised!!! the whole cd is irritating. i can't listen to a whole song without cringing!!!"
1,Beware! Hardly any music from the movie!,"I don't know about most of yall, but I was atleast excpecting more than just classical music named for the movie. I was atleast excpecting the song that is used on the ad for it! It doesn't say anywhere on the package that it is just all classical music."
4,Excellent Music,"I found the soundtrack enjoyable; however, I was disappointed that the music from the commercials and the movie trailer was not included. Where I can get that music? END"
3,not what I expected--wished it was more Loreena-like,"the preview for the movie showcased a Loreena McKennit song, but the CD is all movie score and very long. I haven't listened to it for a second time yet."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this CD and anxiously awaited. I could not get the wrapper off fast enough only to be very disappointed that the music played during the trailer was not on the CD. However I do like the one song from Texas.
4,Good soundtrack for a great movie!,"I'm not going to write a long review, because there are so many other reviews on here, but I am just here to agree that this is a great soundtrack! :)"
5,Wonderful!,"I love it! Beautiful music! In fact, I think that the music is better than the movie! (And I really liked the movie!) Except for ""Put Your Arms Around Me"", I liked every bit of it! The last track was too wild and didn't go with the movie or the feeling of it either. I don't think that they should have put that on there. I am going to buy the soundtrack anyway as soon as possible!"
4,"Love it, Love it, Love it!","When I saw the movie at the movie theatre, I knew I wanted the soundtrack. I ended up buying it for my sister for Christmas! No one can forget the exciting, emotional scene when Danielle marches up to the castle! There is a lot of variety in the tracks, unlike other soundtracks that I have heard. The romance, emotions, moral, and essence of this film are reflected in the music. This soundtrack is good background music, for curling up and reading a book, or for simply going back into the medieval ages!"
3,"good, but not great","This soundtrack was good, but not what I expected. I wish they wouldn't put songs on the commericals, that aren't actually on the soundtrack. I wish I hadn't had to buy three cd's to have all the songs."
4,completely mag!!!!,"The Ever Ater soundtrack is magnificent.I love envisioning the different scenes while listening. Although, I would have liked to hear the music that was advertised with the movie."
2,Just another instrumental...,"I'm glad to know that I'm not the only person that loved the trailer music, in fact, I downloaded the trailer from the web site, just so I could hear ""The Mummers' Dance,"" though at the time I didn't know what it was called. I'm sick of them playing songs in the trailers that are not included in the movie at all. A trailer of the movie ""Mulan,"" included the instrumental song from ""Seven Years In Tibet."" I was very excited about not having to buy both CD's, but when I listened to the ""Mulan"" soundtrack I realized that the song I was looking for was not included at all, in any shape or form. The ""Ever After"" soundtrack lacks the music that reminds me of what Drew Barrymore's character was supposed to represent, a strong female. However, the trailer music went nicely with it, so maybe somebody up there in the music department for Fox needs to start doing their job!!"
2,Not As Advertised in the Film!,"This soundtrack is a disappointment. After watching television ads and trailers in the theater for the film and hearing a haunting score featuring Loreena McKennitt, Robert Miles, Deep Forest, and other New Age/Celtic stars playing their hits, I waited with fervent anticipation for this disk. It doesn't contain any of these artists as featured in the film. This soundtrack is in reality your basic quasi-classical orchestral drivvel with Celtic overtones, ho hum boring, smacks of the soundtrack for TITANIC which is equally dull. Don't waste your time and money on this disk! Wait and hope for a disk of the incidental New Age music as featured in the trailers.......will be well worth the effort."
3,"A good CD, although a little disappointing","I too purchased this CD believing that the 2 songs featured in the trailer would be included. I personally should have paid more attention to what was in the score. Perhaps then I would have noticed that only one of the songs had lyrics. (and the song, by the way, doesn't seem to fit in with the movie) I enjoy the CD, but I definately wouldn't have bought it knowing what the content was. The marketing technique was deceptive; the majority of buyers include teenagers who don't have money to burn, and aren't familiar with the technique. This CD is not quite false advertising, but it comes as close to it as anything I've seen."
5,This cd is for those who enjoy beautiful music,"""Ever After"" was all that I had hoped for. The notes are really beautiful. This is not for those whose taste favors hip hop. If you like ""E.A."", you'll also enjoy ""Beauty and the Beast: the Enchanted Christmas"", ""Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"", ""Gone With the Wind"" soundtrack, and ""The Right Stuff--North and South"" soundtrack. Oh yeah, and the most beautiful of all is the classical piece ""Morning"" by Grieg."
3,Somebody please tell me the answer!!!!,"What are the two songs they sing in the TV preview. Somethink like: ""Just breath"" I know there not on this cd (kind of disappointing), but i would like to know where i can find these songs. I would greatly appreciate anybody's help."
3,"An interesting, entertaining CD!!!!","I was a tad bit disappointed with the cd because their were two songs on the movie preview that the cd does not have. I really wanted to hear those songs, so I was a little dishearted. I still enjoyed the CD."
3,It is great but also disappointing,"I know it sounds a little contradicting by saying the cd is great but also disappointing. Personally I like instrumantal music and the music in the album are so relaxing and soothing. But it is far beyond from what I expected. I thought that theme song (sorry, I don't know the name of the song. but I hope you all understand what I mean) should be in the album, but it was not. Um.... just the album itself can be a 5 stars album, but missing that great song makes it to be a 3 stars cd. Not too bad, right?"
2,Not what your expecting,Rather disappointing soundtrack CD. Not representative of what I expected to hear based on the film and film trailer.
2,dissapointed fan,On the television commercial there is a song that is not on the music cd. Please tell me the name of the song.
1,it sucked,This soundtrack had none of the advertised music. The advertisement music was just to get attention but still the movie rocked.
1,It's not what you think,"I purchased this CD having only seen the trailor of the movie.It's not the same music, 21 of the 22 songs are instrumental. Don't bother buying it."
1,Caveat emptor,"Perhaps it's just my stupidity for buying before seeing the movie, but I didn't get what I expected. I bought the CD based on the samples that are played in the previews advertising the movie. But the entire CD is based on classical movements. Not that I mind the classics, but I had hoped for more than the one lyrical piece on the CD. It's fine for BGM, but for anything else, Caveat Emptor!"
3,Don't Be Fooled by the Trailer Music!!!!!,"I have to say that the movie Ever After is one of the refreshing movies of the summer. I recommend it to all audiences of all ages and sexes(well the girls might enjoy it more then the boys), but don't go out buying the soundtrack without looking at what songs are on it!!!! The soundtrack is good, but it doesn't have the music you heard in the trailer!!!! I have to say that is dissapointment because the tailer music is so good. I have the two CD's that have the trailer music and they are a very good listen. Robert Miles is the one you need to go out to buy if you want the Fable song!!!!"
4,Great Soundtrack,"Pretty decent soundtrack for the film, and unlike a lot of musical soundtracks, the songs on this CD really give you the feeling of watching the film again. Especially good is ""Walking on Water."" The only problem with this CD is that it lacks the two songs that were used in the Trailers, ""Robert Mile's ""Fable"" and ""Mummer's Dance"" by Loreena McKennitt. The last song on the CD, ""Texas"" which has vocals, is a bit wierd as well."
1,Can't I put ***ZERO*** stars down? This track was a waste,"I paid $23 for this soundtrack because I thought it had the songs from the trailer, just like everyone else. I even paid an extra $5 just to get in 2 days before it was supposed to be released (I slipped the clerk a 5). I got into my car, skipped through every song in about 2 minutes, then threw it out the window as I drove off. this track stunk. I would recomend it to people with no life and horrible musical taste. I would not recomend this to people thinking of suicide because it will probably throw them over the edge. (in case you're looking to give somebody a present... or you just don't like them) I would recomend the creators of the the trailer/movie to either pay me my $23 or put the trailer songs on a CD-R and send it to my house. I'll never buy anything they make again. What a rip!!!!!"
4,Marine Chemistry Text,"Seller was very prompt with shipping, and product was as described. I recommend this seller, but I recommend that you check with your class/instructor to make sure you need this book for the course, because in my class it was not required, only recommended, and I have not found the book useful."
1,never got it,"book never sent, seller was slow to communicate (waited 4-5 days for an e-mail response) after my questions, full refund was issued (blamed on the postal service). Very inconvenient as I had a test in the class the following week and no way to get a book! Seller also originally referred to my book as an algebra book when it was a psychology book, and referred to me as ""Gary"" when my name is Gigi."
4,Black and White film,"I would definitly recommend to those who still use film, there is no other like it! Pictures are a much better quality"
3,Clock Great - Thermometer Not,"I really like this clock, it was exactly what I was looking for. I was able to set the time easily and painlessly, but the thermometer always says it is 64 degrees. It is disappointing because I do like the look of it, but I just won't settle for something that only half way works no matter what I paid for it. Going back tomorrow. :o("
1,Clock stopped working. Unbeatable Sale.Com would not return my money.,This clock stopped working after two months. Unbeatable Sale.com would not return my money. Chaney Instruments has sent me replacements clocks that do not work. They will not return my money. I would not recommend Unbeatable Sale.com for any purchase. Nor would I recommend any clocks made my Chaney Instruments. I have been waiting now for six weeks for a fourth replacement clock. Never ever again would I use either of these companies.
1,not worth it,The clock hasn't kept the right time since i got. I have on the side of my garage which customer service said may allow too much interference. its an outdoor clock right? Where am i supposed to hang it.
1,terrible clock,We purchased this clock and it did not work. Had the proper battery. Exchanged the clock for a new one and it still doesn't work. We will send it back to Amazon. Worse purchase ever!!
3,"Great, in theory; Is dependent on the one you get","I had to return the first two clocks (Amazon was wonderful) because they would fail to keep the proper time. Specifically, whereas other 'atomic' clocks I have in my house would find the Colorado transmitter, this would not. Further, the clock would run fast, which would not get self-corrected by the nightly 'atomic' sync. The third one they sent seems better."
1,It doesn't keep time,"It simply doesn't work. It seems to lose about 5 minutes per day. It's useless.I don't even care about the ""atomic"" feature. I just needed an outdoor clock and this one is never correct. I've been trying to fix this and figure out the ""atomic"" for about 3 months."
3,Clock,"I like the size and looks of the clock, but it is always 5 minutes slow, does not correct itself, nor does it ""stay corrected"" when changed manually."
2,hour hand stuck on thermometer,"Bought the clock in May. Summer in Texas brutal. Clock placed on tenniscourt. Evidently heat warped face of clock; thermometer gauge and hour hand stuck; broke the clock. I didn't keep any of the shipping material, so tough to return to the manufacturer."
1,Defective Product,I gave this as a gift. The recipient had to send it back in less than a week because it stopped working. Amazon was quick to replace it with no hassle. The second one also quit working in a matter of days and was returned for credit. I was embarrassed and would tell others to avoid purchasing this clock.
2,Hand's keep droppong down,I have had this clock for over a year. And in that time I've had to try to get the hand's to not fall down. I just had it the house again and I'll see if that work's this time. I would buy this clock again.
2,Save your money!,"First I bought the Infinity 24"" radio clock, which is beautiful, but too heavy. It promptly fell off the wall and broke the glass. So then I bought this since it is smaller and weighs less. I'm giving it two stars because it is a very pretty clock, and the thermometer is larger than most, but it would help if it worked!~ I can't get the clock to link up with Colorado, and the thermometer doesn't work at all. The directions for linking the clock are anything but clear. So, I'm not surprised to see they aren't selling it now. I just bought mine last week, probably the last one they sold."
1,Clock didn't work,Lovely clock but was never able to set the atomic clock nor even get it to work with a battery like a regular clock. Contacted Chaney Instruments (EXCELLENT customer service) and they sent me a new one. Love the look of the clock and new one works great so 5 stars if you get one from Amazon that works 0 if you don't.
1,Loose Barrel Spring,"Not a bad product when you think about it. Good idea really. However, poor manufacturing. These nippers take a nice cut and the spring opens up the handles for continuous use. However, the spring keeps falling out. Back to the drawing board."
2,dull blades,"My experience is that after only a few uses, the nippers do not cut very well. I didn't have any problem with the spring falling out, however."
3,A little unbelievable.,"The book was good, but to me it was a little unbelievable. There seemed to be a disproportionate amount of spouse abuse, unfaithfulness and bad relationships. There seem to be few ""good"" people in the book at all. I felt it was depressing and the ending left too many things hanging. An epilogue would have been nice to clear a few things up."
3,Very Eighties Sound From Dale And Gary Rossington,"If you are looking for Southern Rock on this album forget about it. Dosen't sound like Rosington-Collins band stuff either. However I did enjoy this record. Nice singing from Dale and playing from Gary and the band. Very 80's sounding, reminds me of Ellen Foley from the same time period. The more I listen the more I like. So give it a shot since you can get it here pretty cheap."
5,"Healing, inspiring, grace!","Bob Lively has taken the 12 steps of AA (and other groups) and transformed it into everyday life. This captivating book has done more for me than any book I've ever read! God Bless you Bob Lively! From God's lips to your hand, this book is a savior!"
4,Great beach shoes!,I bought these shoes for a summer holiday as they are light weight and pack up small. They are super comfy to wear and your feet wont overheat in the summer. Easy to clean (just throw them in the washing machine!) so if you get wet sand in them or whatever they can handle it. Brilliant beach shoes and recommended!
1,Please Say Goodbye,"This is the worst CD I have heard in years. Alyson's first CD effort (RAW-1989)is the best CD by this artist. Unfortunately, the songs have no radio play potiential and definitely lacks sound. Ms. Williams is still in good voice not good material. I just hope that on her next project it would have mass appeal and not trying to imitate the late great Phyllis Hyman. If Alyson is imitating Phyllis Hyman she should remember there was only one. I must admit there is one song on the CD that caught my attention "" Say Goodbye"". If Alyson is going to continue to sing the material chosen then she should ""Say Goodbye"" to the industry for good.Say Goodbye, Do NOT Buy!"
3,I just can't say,"I don't know if this is necessary or not. I guess better safe than sorry. Mr Heater gives mixed signals on when to use it. I bought it as prevention, not cure."
5,works,Works just like it should. And a very good reason to have it if you are using a 20 lb bottle or larger.
2,Waste of an Item,This did not even last 6 hours worth of use before I was restricting flow to my Mr. Big Buddy heater. These cost too much to change every 6 hours. I have 2 Mr. Big Buddys and the filters in both lasted about the same amount of time.The Mr. Big Buddy is great though.
4,Mr. Heater Fuel Filter for Portable Buddy,The item is easy to hook up. I have had no problems with this item. The item is well built do not have to worry about breaking it.
5,Mr. Heater Fuel Filter for Portable Buddy Heater,This fuel filter is designed for the Mr. Heater Portable Buddy Heater. These are great products and are highly recommended!
3,It's a filter - and it - well - filters...,"What can you say about a filter?It fits, and it filters.If you have ever gotten trash in a gas orifice, you will appreciate a filter to keep it from happening again.Mission accomplished?"
1,DO NOT BUY TO CONNECT TO BIG BUDDY FUEL HOSE !!!!!,"DO NOT BUY TO CONNECT TO BIG BUDDY FUEL HOSE !!!!!The Mr. Heater Fuel Filter for Portable Buddy and Big Buddy Heaters.It's Impossible to tell if this product does as advertised. It was ordered and recieved in a reasonable time period along with The Big Buddy Heater and Big Buddy Fuel Hose to attach to a Propane Tank (Where It Might Be Needed). It was packaged decently. The problem was that The Fuel Filter CANNOT Connect to The Big Buddy Fuel Hose, There Is NO Way To Make It Fit. The Problem Is That The Fuel Filter Has A THREADED Connection And The Fuel Hose Has A QUICK FIT Connection. I Would Return It If Not For The Fact That It Would Be More Of A Hassle Than It's Worth. I WILL BE WRITING TO MR. BIG BUDDY. AS IF CORPORATE AMERICA IS NOT RIPPING OFF THE WORKING PEOPLE ENOUGH. *** I Would Have Given ZERO Stars IF Possible***"
5,Happy Customer!,My father picked up the tape at a garage sale and so I bought him the CD as a gift. He loves it. He listens to it all the time.
1,This is the worst instructional video I have ever seen.,"Please make your self a favor and do not buy this video. I do not want to be disrespecful to the other person who review the tape, but I can not imagine a worst video. I am only a rookie at C.Q.B. but what I saw in that video you could learn in five minutes watching any discovery channel special feature on SWaT teams. This video left me with a doubt, are this guys real ex-U.S.NAVY SEAL's and if they are is this the way they were trained (I don't think so ). I am a vocational instructor so I know what it takes to make any instructional material, and let me tell you this has none of the essentials. P.S. If you know of a good C.Q.B., tactical or tactical driving video please let me know."
1,CQB - Can't Quite Believe,"how bad this video was. Showed alot of talk and very little instruction in methods and deployment. The whole video you watch a bunch of guys run around playing paint ball in doors and the only thing they actually gave instruction on was the how to hold the weapon. This video really sucked and did not give what it promises. It was nothing more than an advertisment for their school, which no longer exists. - I wonder why."
3,Not bad...but I could have done without the sales pitch...,"Surprisingly not too bad. I took a shot and have to admit my expectations were not that much to begin with. The video gets into tactics and techniques which I enjoyed but it has too many side stories and too much of the ""instructors"" making sales pitches about the course. The video was obviously made as an enticing invitation to take the CQB course where the video was shot."
1,Product did not run,"I purchased this product as a gift, however it did not work, so I sent it back and my account was reimbursed."
2,Lara's bust is the best part....,"I purchased this recently (many years after the release date) and was seriously disappointed in the voice acting and the graphics. In addition to this, the gameplay and puzzles are intensely frustrating and I nearly punched out the screen after dying trying to jump the chasm for the hundredth time!The guns are like the weapons of the 1993 Doom game (bad!!!). Though the crossbow and lasersight can be cool, I only used it on the demo because I never got far enough in the games to find it! The camera angle is focused on Lara's sorry posterior, what's wrong with seeing her front-on occasionally!The only positve aspect of the games is that Lara has a decent figure and is well sexy!If you want true adventure and no messing about, buy Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb. However, if you like cyberbabes look no further than Tomb Raider."
2,Beware of advertisements in these recordings,These stories are well done but what they neglect to mention is that there are advertisements 2 to 3 times per episode. A major flaw. When I pay for a recoeded story I don't want to have to forward through the ads. So be warned if you don't like advertising in your listening experience don't buy these!!!
3,Well done but padded,"The programs are well-done and professionally produced. Unfortunately, many of them seem to be padded to fit into the proper length. Some editing and a shorter run time would do wonders for them. However, even as is, they are very enjoyable."
5,Good stuff,"This brand is excellent. Gotu Kola is good for the bladder, seizure control and I'm sure many more things I'm not aware of. Gaia herbs is one of the best out there...great quality and good prices."
3,Pretty good little movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon,"Trapped is a pretty good movie I think. Lloyd Bridges plays his role well. An escaped, tough con on the run and trying to make one last big score so he and his girlfriend can go to Mexico. Barbera Payton is his girlfriend and man is she a hottie!The movie starts off with a quick high school type lecture on how money is made and all the other responsibilities of the US Treasury. After that we learn of the evils and perils of counterfitting.The feds discover a resurgance of counterfit money that had Lloyd locked away. They make a deal with him for early parole if he helps the feds catch the new counterfeiters and recovet the plates.But Lloyd has other plans. What ensues is a cat and mouse game between the feds and the counterfeiters. When the undercover agent gets his cover blown, the fun really begins.This is one of those great old flicks that would probably be a blockbuster if it was remade."
2,An okay first effort!,"I thought ""Trust in Me"" by P.M. Eichler was just an okay first effort. Nothing special. I thought the premise was okay (should have been better developed), but it was doable. The lack of editing is what really got on my nerves. Maybe the next book by this new writer will be better."
5,Amazing please don't discontinue,The item is amazingI heard it is a discontinues product please keep selling it online as it is hard to find it locally
3,"A fine book, but not sure why I got it now.","OK, now that I have this book, I'm not sure why I got it. Maybe I should sell it since it seems to have gone out of print again and the used versions have skyrocketed in price! My copy is still in mint condition (barely opened!).The book is mainly composed of engineering draft quality line drawings of the various parts of the Yamato (some 159 pages), with breakdowns of virtually every external part of the ship conceivable (e.g., masts, gun turret machinery, steam pipe vents, tackle, etc.). Nothing about the innards of the ship.There's 8 pages of photographs, and sixteen pages of text describing the Yamato's history and construction.A great book for model builders and Ultra-Enthusiasts of battleships!Too bad I'm not one of those..... what the heck was I thinking anyways?.... it's just too easy to click and order from Amazon.com."
4,yamato,"As usual this is a very good book for those interested in how a ship is built but unless you also own the cruiser Takao you will have to do some added research into the boats, etc to build a large scale model."
5,DEFINITIVE book available on this vessel,"If you are interested in the Yamato from a historical, engineering or modeling perspective this book is a MUST for your reference materials. While only having a limited number of photos (Very few exist), the bulk of the information here is in line drawings and specifications. A top notch job of reconstructing the engineering of this mighty ship. The author has assembled about as much information as could be expected given the lack of material available."
4,Almost 5 starts,"Almost 5 stars because there is some information that is missing. But that's ok, giving the mystery surrounding this battleship and lack of formal literature from the Japanese imperial Navy. A must have for those putting the Yamato kit together, but don't expect a step by step set of instructions. It's more like a collection of data to support the task of building the kit and avoid common mistakes."
4,Little Milton back on top,"My man, Little Milton is one of the BIG Stars of the chitlin curcuit and on this album he proves another time what he is able to - great interpretations of old songs and some great new originals.As a follow-up to his rewarding ""Cheating Habit""-album this one shows one more time Milton's capability to interprete old songs. Nevertheless, who needs another ""Rainy Night In Georgia""or ""To Love Somebody"" ? What are the tune-smiths at Malaco doing? Usuallys they come up with some southern Soul stuff that is much better than Bee Gees!! Milton' s blues guitar shows one more time his ability to say much more in four notes than rockers like Stevie Ray or Gary Moore do with 100 notes. And his voice -- oh Lord, there'' s only Bobby Bland who can top that!! Buy this one!!!!"
5,It really works,I've used several conditioners but this is by far the best. Excellent quality and a affordable prince. You actually feel this working and penetrating into your scalp! My hair has never looked so healthy... I highgly recommend this product =)
5,An Utterly Singular Experience,"James Merrill's extraordinary poem is surely one of the most remarkable and distinctive literary accomplishments of the 20th Century (though there are many, most in acadamia, whou would disagree). Yes, it is very strange and ocassionaly obscure. But it is, after all, a narrative poem and not nearly as difficult as some claim.Most and best of all, however, it is a work of which one seems to never tire. After 10 years, this reader still finds it utterly fresh and its meaning and relevance ever more personal and touching. No 20th Century poet was as astounding as Merrill at his flashiest, and very few are as sincerely moving.Like Wagner's Ring Cycle (a major metaphor and touchstone of the poem), it is the sheer scope and brillance of author's imagination that ultimately thrills the reader the most. And in that respect, even in its darkest, most alarming moments, it is a hugely positve and life affirming work."
1,"Recordcompany-release, just to make some money!!","This Best Of only features songs from the first mini-album and from the two first albums. No tracks from the last one ""Motel California"" who is selfreleased. The recordcompany can therefore not include tracks from that album on this release without UKJ:s permission. They didn't get it. A Best Of-release cannot show how a band have matured and changed if it doesn't contain tracks from the start to the end. This release does not show the respect the band need. There are songs who should be there and some who should be removed. This compilation is not well compiled. Buy their albums instead. This release actually isn't worth one star."
2,I'm still yawning.,"Though the book was amusing at times, it was boring for long stretches of time. I felt as though the couple did not spend enough time together. The story is unbelievable. I find it hard to believe that a man would make such a vow as the one Quentin made, let alone keep it for more than two minutes. I like his Uncle Nick and felt that he was quite a man. He was very accepting. I liked Quentin also."
4,Pretty but small,"I was surprised when I received this necklace--I totally thought the beads were larger in diameter! Although the coral beads are not as big as I had hoped, the necklace is well made and worth the money."
2,not what i thought,"I thought this product would stop a stump from a tree I had to cut down from bleeding. I bought 3 cans and they didn't even begin to cover the stump, next time I ordered 4. Well the bleeding eventual stopped on its own and now I have little green sprigs growing out the side of the tree. I thought this would stop all growth. Dont waste your money. Plus, half through spraying all of the cans stop working with liquid left in there. What a wast of time and money."
4,Knocking off a star just due to the packaging....,"These are (I bought two) very nice recorders. Don't let people tell you the plastic ones sound just as good. I own both, and there's no comparison. It's nice that this comes with a cleaning stick, but the storage case is something that looks like it was made out of clear shower curtain material. I'm going to end up searching for, or making a better case for it. It does come with a fingering chart.My wife is a music teacher, and she was very impressed with the quality of the tone."
2,Not very well made,"I had really high hopes for this product and was very excited when it arrived. Good sound, good feel, but within a few months it was very loose and wouldn't stay in tune. I would see this as frustrating to beginners and unacceptable for those more advanced.[...]"
5,Hohner 9550 Pearwood 2- Piece Soprano Recorder,"My grandaughter has been enjoying this instrument to the max for two school years now. Hopefully, next Christmas, she and I will play a duet (soprano & tenor). Nothin better than this."
3,Plastic Bag a Problem,"I read the reviews that mentioned the cheap plastic sleeve bag the Hohner soprano recorder came in. Those reviews were too kind in the complaints about the bag,which is for me more of a problem than anything about the recorder since there is a sticky residue on the plastic that is from the packing label,and it wont wash out! Shame on Hohner for cheap work.As for the recorder itself,nothing special except the beauty of the wood finish which I do like,as for sound ,no better than my recently purchased excellent Yamaha YRS 24B soprano recorder ,plastic, and has a nice cloth bag and cost $8.00. The Hohner sound is no better than the plastic Yamaha.Summation I purchased the Hohner because I do like the wood and the price for both recorders is affordable ,with the Yamaha being a real bargain."
5,beautiful sounding piece,"I'm very impressed with the recorder. I learned on a plastic model, and this sounds many times better. Highly recommended."
3,Plays nicely; finish hides the wood,"I just received the recorder so can't speak to its durability, but it plays nicely and in tune and the price is right. I don't detect any real difference in tone or playability from my plastic Yamaha 302B, although the Hohner seems a little more slippery. I was disappointed,however, to find that the finish is opaque, so you can't see the grain of the wood. I'd prefer to be able to see at a glance that it is indeed a wooden recorder. Also, it is made in China, not in Germany, so that detail in the description should be changed."
5,Product and customer service unmatched,"I recently purchased this item after my cat figured out how to get at the food in 2 other feeders (he is like a goldfish-would eat himself to death if I let him!). It is fantastic. He cannot get through the slanted slot at the food (though he spent the first 2 days staring at it, trying to figure out how he could) and it has been very reliable. I did have an issue with the timer that came with the product and contacted the company. I had a response the same day. The customer service was perfect-100% stood behind their product and sent another timer at their expense (without making me go through the trouble of sending the other one back). If only all companies stood behind their products like this one. Definitely worth the money for the quality and customer service that come with it."
2,Nothing,"I thought that it will be an artistic erotic film before watching it.After watching it, I felt like I was being cheated.It has nothing.Theere were no artistic moment in sex scene or nudity. They are very stupid and lame.Sylvia was not beautiful for me enough.I honestly don't know how this movie became legend.Also the story wise, I don't agree how she changed her sexual taste by the man she met. It needed more detail."
4,adult dvd,A diffrent older adult DVD than Im used to but still found it intresting to watch. worth buying for the price
1,Is not UNCUT version,"No good, is missing many good parts of the whole movie, I watched this movie in the theater and it was very good,but I ordered on Amazon.com and this version has many cuts,I'm disappointed."
3,Sweet-looking Sylvia Kristel keeps our eyes alert...,"""Emmanuelle"" is an elegant, excellently photographed movie, but too often rolls in a syrupy pretension...It is about a young, French woman who joins her husband in Bangkok... There much of Emmanuelle's allure is that she isn't shy about her body, or even afraid to engage in sexual activity in semipublic places...There are a number of rousing, lesbian meetings very typical of French cinema, coupled with encounters with handsome, sensitive men who enjoy superficial lovemaking... The film really deals in sensual images and an over-blown, continuous repeating of its erotic philosophy... There is sensual intimacy between Emmanuelle and the other women that is rare in the cinema...My favorite moment when teen-ager Christine Boisson comes upon the nude Sylvia Kristel asleep... Without embarrassment, she leans forward and unusually caresses gently and affectionately Emmanuelle's breast with her finger..."
2,Has not aged well at all.,"Emmanuelle (Just Jaeckin, 1974)So this is where it all began: Just Jaeckin's film of Jean-Louis Richard's screen adaptation of Emmanuelle Arsan's... novel? Memoir? Who knows? (Actually, not where it truly began; there was an Italian adaptation in 1969, but it certainly didn't explode the way this did.) Arsan, played by Sylvia Kristel, goes to Thailand to join her husband, and finds herself in a number of erotic entanglements with various folks. (Of especial note: Christine Boisson, also at the beginning of her career.) As is to be expected form this sort of film, you're not going to get much in the way of technical excellence or brilliant scriptwriting; the focus here is on flesh, flesh, and more flesh, tied together with the most tissue-thin of plots. If you like that sort of thing, of course, this is one of the most important movies ever made. If you don't, it's the start of a plague. For the rest of us, it's just bad softcore that hasn't aged well. *"
3,got the wrong region,I was new to amazon when I got thisand found I had ordered two of the itemsone of the classics from the early eightiesshowing how a woman might find men attractiveand the antics she would get up to invarious situations like at the shopsor the library but in this case a massage roomand with friends of friends and of courseutter strangersit's the intelligent use of props and lightingthat made it a hit and now a classic
1,Emmanuelle,"This movie was probably the worst movie that I have ever seen and a complete waste of money. Poorly written and directed, lousy acting, rambling story line and not even sensual. Save your money and skip this junk."
3,Very naughty,"Just shy of some gross porn, but excellent musical score, shame soundtrack is no longer available."
2,Emmanuelle,"I would suppose that somewhere I was told this movie was in French. I really hate subtitles. I spend time reading and cannot concentrate on the movie. Therefore, I did not enjoy the movie. The story was not interesting. I was looking forward to sceens I could recount and there just wasn't any."
4,Older movie but very sexy,This film is for someone looking for something a more subtle than just outright porn but is looking for solid erotica. For years I have thought about watching this movie and I am glad I did. I think this is a timeless piece of adult entertainment that was worth looking into.
2,Emmanuelle pass its sell by date,"It is an icon, but it is so silly that I wonder why.It probably was ""revolutionary"" in breaking tabus in the early 1970s, but now........It is just a soft porn movie and very badly acted."
4,Love it for what it is,"A low budget erotic flick, that probably inspired the creation of many others. Tame by today's standards, after Halle Berry revolutionized the R-rating in Monster's Ball, but still full of surprises, especially how it breaks taboos and ventures into fantasies openly. The only annoying character is Mario and his philisophy on the outer realms of pleasure_ kinda funny, at the same time. Besides, the lead actress has the face of an angel. Watch it with a girlfriend."
1,Historic DVD,This DVD was defective and I could not play it on my player. It was not returned but was discarded.
2,Somethings missing,"I had seen this film years ago and thought I'd give it another try.. Sound and background music are on the poor side.. Acting is vauge. There is an attempt to prop up the acting with nudity buy even that failed.. Having been to Thailand, I must say I enjoyed the background shots of the country, but it didn't help the movie much..The director of this film went all out to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.. WHY was this put in the adult section? Don't waste you money on this movie.. You'd be better off watching a cartoon.... Another beauty from the wonderful folks at Amazon.com. Thats strike three for this kid..."
2,Emmanuelle,"I remember watching Emmanuelle and fascinating to watch if just for the all sexy stuff except that two guys 1 girl part yuck! leave it to the french,to europeans to make such a movie and label it ""art"". Again as a Guy, Cool to watch the movie, but I see no art value and some would argue art is in the eye of the beholder. well behold this good skin-a-max film. highly recommended just for the scenes but watch it first."
1,lousy,"yes,lousy.to call this movie erotic is a joke.plot is pretty good.main idea is simple - its good to be a king.in plain Englishit means if you have money you do whatever you want,in this case have fun."
1,painful,"I really like the look of this shoe for work, especially the low heel. But, I wore them one day and have the worst blisters on my heels. They are so bad I can't even wear normal shoes, and its been 5 days. Conseidering the brand I expected them to be the most comfortable shoes ever. I wore them without stockings, so that may be the problem. Hopefully I can break them in and will be able to wear them again because they were such a great deal!"
1,Painful to wear,"Smart looking shoes, painful to wear!!!. If you have delicate feet, these shoes are definitely not for you, first time I wore them, I developed awful blisters. I do not have wide feet but these shoes are really narrow. If you normally buy Naturalizer for their reputation of being comfortable, you should not buy these shoes."
5,Amanda is a Great Ambassador for Bats!,"This book really makes a person realize that bats -- for all the bad publicity and myths around them -- are really wonderful creatures with distinct personalities and a lot to offer. Amanda writes a warm story with great detail about bat behavior and her own personal growth. I like that she doesn't sugarcoat the problems she had and that it is apparent keeping bats (and all wildlife, really) is not only unwise (and probably illegal) for the normal person but a difficult and challenging task. If everyone read this book, there would be a lot better understanding of the important role bats play in the environment and why they should be appreciated rather than feared."
5,Eleven years and still memorable!,"My fourth grade teacher read this book to the entire class eleven years ago. I still remember the title and how much I loved listening about a caring woman and her unexpected friend. There wasn't a single student in the class that didn't enjoy this book. If you're looking for a heartwarming tale of friendship with a very original plot, look no further."
1,Cheap MADE IN CHINA junk,"I recently bought the Converse Desert 8"" Tactical boot and the zipper broke on the second use. I attempted to communicate with Converse and they failed to respond after the 1st email. My conclusion is that Converse does NOT stand behind their product and that these are Cheap MADE IN CHINA crap and not worthy their customer support. Consequently, I will NEVER buy anything made by Converse again. I make below minimum wage and it took me forever to save up for what I thought were quality boots."
3,Therein lies love and pain,"I am glad to read such rave reviews for this cd. Wish I could give it 3.5 stars. I really love about half of the songs but the rest just didn't reach me. Songs like ""It's Jesus I love"" I can listen to over and over but I find myself skipping over ""Blind old friends"" time and time again. Her voice is a treat and this cd is well worth buying ."
1,Waste of a few bucks,"I can't provide a good rating to this game. We installed it on several of our computers and could only get it to work on the gaming laptop, and then only briefly. I could get it through the hidden beginning menu screen and extremely slow loading, but after about 2 minutes into the game, it would crash.Time and money wasted."
2,Graphics are dated,"I'm split on how to rate this game. The strategic aspect of the game is great. I enjoy sneaker games and Thief is supposed to be the gold standard. But I could not play this game. I installed it and ran it and then after the first mission I gave up. The graphics are too dated.What did it for me were the trees that were low polygon oblate spheroids. After FarCry, Thief's graphics just don't do it for me.If you like classic games, Thief should be good, but the dated graphics were a deal breaker for me. If only someone could graft a current game engine onto the game and update the textures and models..."
5,sit's all day in the TX heat and still works,Bought this for my Xcarlink ipod adapter for my car. I needed an little extra length so I bought an extension and it's still working fine.
2,Unreliable,"Sometimes, I have to click this SEVERAL times for it to do the job. Can be frustrating, but it has worked each time"
3,Somewhat worth it,"To start off, I was quite disappointed with this DVD set when I purchased it. Clearly, it was made very cheaply on ADV/Sentai Filmwork's part; smashing 6 full episodes on a single disc. Normally, if there were 12 episodes they would be spread onto 3 disc, maybe 4 episodes to a disc. The more time used on a disc the more reduction in audio/video quality.*Another big concern was that ADV did not pay for English dialogue to be made. They simply took the original Japanese dialogue from Japan and put that on each disc wit subtitles. Big downer!!Ultimately, I would say that the product is well worth it, if and only if you're like me and enjoy original dialogue and if ADV never plans to re-release Clannad with fewer episodes per disc and English dubbing."
4,Big Dango Family,"Sentai Filmworks best ever anime in my opinion, Made by Kyoto Animation just like Kanon and Air TV. I love everything made by kyoto animation, if you like drama animes you would to.12 episodes on two disks, Widescreen 16:9, Rated TV PG so just about anyone can enjoy this anime. Special Features: Clean opening, closing & trailorsOnly bad part is that its English Subtitles Only, Japanese Audio 2.0, but the price is well worth it."
2,DIMENSIONS NOT STATED,"SCOREBOARD WAS SMALLER THEN EXPECTED....PURCHASED IDENTICAL BOARD PREVIOUSLY, AND IT WAS 14X18...THIS ONE MEASURED 10X13THE DIMENSION WAS NOT STATED IN WEB SITE......"
1,Where did they combat test this?,Clearly they didn't test this on toy poodles or any other dog. My poodle chewed through his in under 15 minutes. These are garbage!
3,well made but..,the sqeaker barely squeaks so my dog doesn't even play with it. How hard would it have been to put a decent sqeaker in it?
1,Another marketing piece of garbage!,"This product lasted about the same length of time as the other ""combat tested"" item. They must be tested by toothless dogs."
5,Wealth of detail,"Colonel Callwell's book is a ""must"" for any student of military history and also practicing members of the armed forces. The wealth of detail and the numerous references to actual events and the ability to clearly convey the concept of how to manage such operations. I return to this volume constantly."
5,Great Coffee!!!!!!,My husband and I visited Finca Azotea in November 2010. The tour was very informative and the coffee was beyond awesome!!!I think you will be pleased with this coffee - give it a try!!!
3,you don't have to be a scholar,"I am no scholar of the 12-1300's but I did enjoy the mystery surrounding the history lesson. If you simply want a good read, in a different time frame that anyone in the family can read this is a good choice. I enjoy the word play and personal exchanges that have grown between Simon and Baldwin through the course of this series. This book and the others in the series are great travel and beach books. We don't always have to take everything in life seriously enjoy the read."
4,A very good medieval era mystery,"Just finished this book and I thought it was very good. I believe it will appeal to both lovers of the mystery genre and medieval historicals. This author has a very readable style and he never seems to bore me like so many authors. This book details the account of a murder of one of the 13th century tin miners and surrounding conflict between the tin miners with their ""Stannary privileges"" and the local nobles in Devon, England. I am more of a fan of historical fiction, but the author was able to keep me interested in the mystery and also provide enough historical flavor to keep me entertained throughout the whole book. Jecks also always seems to insert some history into the overall backdrop of the book which is great. I didn't know anything about the ""Stannary laws"" but I do now! I didn't figure out who the killer was in this one until the end. If you want a big heaping of medieval flavor wrapped around a murder mystery than definitely grab this book!"
4,Decent enough,"A nice trip down memory lane for those of us who remember 2nd Ed. An interesting tale, but sometimes the names became unwieldy and trying to remember who was who became difficult, but I chalk that up to old age."
2,"book1= amazing book, 2&3 = boring","i love FR, and book 1 was amazing, great pacing, good characters, faultless really. but books 2 an3 were just a struggle too get thru. i'd like to think there was a reason for it or something. not a keeper."
3,Writing Workout: A program for new students of English,"This book was not in such a good condition as the first book I ordered from Amazon. It was a disappointment. I realized that it said 'Used' and this case, they meant it.Thank you,Irene Arce-Tovar"
1,DON'T BUY THIS SEAT IF YOUR BABY IS MORE THAN 18lbs AND 25 INCHES!!!!!!!,"We bought this carseat for our 6 months old daughter. It is supposed to be suitable for a baby upto 22 lbs. and 29 inches tall. Our baby is only 18lbs. and 25 inches tall yetthe harness fits so tightly that we will have toget another carseat in the next couple of months. They must have used a dummy baby with nothing on when they determined that it's good enough for a baby that is 29 inches tall. What they forgot is that babies wear diapers and sometime thicker clothes in cold weather. Yes, we stretched every bit of the belt that is available yet it's just not long enough. Whoever designed the belt deserves to be fired."
3,Classic Cartoons,"Classic Cartoons. Not the best transfer to DVD, but what do you expect. A collector's item, but today's kids wouldn't enjoy it."
5,Better than just Photoshop Books Alone,This book has some valuable info for the screenprinter who utilizes photoshop for creating designs as well as color seperating.. I purchased this along with the Photoshop Classroom in a Book and found them to be of enormous help in starting my own t-shirt business. It also helped me in getting images ready for the web which came in handy since I sell t-shirts online. Check out my t-shirts that I created using some of the tips I have learned. www.absurdatees.com ..
3,good service,The book was shipped very fast. It seems to have some helpfull information however wish it gave more detail to basics.
4,Dutch Delight,"Excellent, consistent debut from this cool Dutch band. Very much garage-made R&B. Quite similar to the Pretty Things, but with its own individual stamp. Whether recording covers of soul and blues songs written by the likes of Willie Dixon, Otis Redding, Bo Diddley, and Allen Touissant, or their own, Nuggets-style, fuzz-blasted rock and roll with snarling vocals, these guys seemed to be on target. There are no bad songs on this collection, including the 4 bonus tracks, and the 3 or 4 best songs stand up to anything recorded by bands from this era and genre."
4,"Mostly for ""I Got Nightmares""","I first heard this group in the spring of 88. I was a 20 year old who was going against the grain as far as music went. I used to listen to alot of Pebbles albums, and this was off the European garage band album. ""I Got Nightmares"" is a pounder where it sounds as though they tried to fuse the Pretty Things and Love together, and it's a rather nice slice indeed. ""It Came To Me"" could've been just as good except for the harmonicas. I'm sure everyone is like ""Dan!!!...It's Just a Stinking Instrument....Get Over It!!!"". The rest I have to sample at a later time."
5,Great Book,"My son is 4, and he was so excited about this book. He loves it. The paperback version is made of pretty good material, too."
5,Historical Kobudo tape!,"This is an excellent video of Kobudo by a great master. This video focuses a little more on the Bo (staff) than the other wooden weapons, nevertheless is very good. A document to be treasured!"
3,Matayoshi Kobudo Video One,This video contains some interesting dialogue with one of Okinawa's most revered Kobudo masters. It is most interesting.
5,quantum leap 1 season,We love quantum leap and have been waiting forever for it's release. It's about time!!!!!!!
3,"Love the series, but...","If I had seen this before I saw the series in reruns, I would probably never have watched the series. It is confusing and kind of boring. But, if you like Quantum Leap, then go ahead and get it."
5,More season sets please!!,This ROCKS. So glad they finally did this-- bring on the rest of the seasons!!!
5,Timeless,"I love Quantum Leap!! It's so exciting to be able to enjoy shows of the past. I was hoping to share it with my 8 year old son, who is very much into science and science fiction, but after previewing it, I quickly changed my mind. It is not for children his age. Too many adult situations. Al constantly talks about his love life and being with women. And the morals are tailored to adults, as well. I still love it like I did when I was young, but I was a teenager when I first started watching it. So, my advice, hold off for awhile if you think this is family entertainment. I backed out after the first episode."
3,"AWEsome content, but not for price...","i absolutely LOVE quantum leap, but i neglected to read the back before purchasing ( in the store for 60 bucks)...there are only NINE episodes!!!!...that's a complete ripoff, most 23 episode tv series' seasons aren't over 50...so i was quite disappointed when i opened it and looked to see how many episodes i hadn't seen...8 of the 9, which is a good percentage, but NINE!!!!??? ouch. i'm putting season 2 on my wish list, but i will never pay 45 or more dollars for it if there aren't at least 23 episodes...if there're 12 or 13 i'd pay up to 35."
5,One word... WOW!,"I'd give it a gazillion starts if I could, but Amazon allows only 5...THANK YOU whoever decided to finally release Quantum Leap on DVD! This show is GRRRREAT!!! Luckily my DVD player reads region 1 DVDs too, otherwise I would have bought another DVD player just for Quantum Leap!I can't wait for other seasons to be released(I hope God, time, or MGM is listening)! BTW people, watch out for the Easter eggs (I found 3 in the first DVD), they're good. Thanks Scott, Dean, Don and all the cast and crew for one of the best shows ever!"
2,Only 8 episodes?,"I really think the price tag of 44 bucks for 8 episodes is a rip off. You can get 22 episodes of Buffy for 38. They should have put the first and second seasons together and offered it for a better price. I love Quantum Leap, but I will probably wait and get a used set for on the cheap."
3,Another mediocre Universal release,"I was really disapointed when I opened this set 8 episodes, 9 if you count the second half of the pilot. Add to that the lack of any kind of booklet, the holder has a ad for a D-Day museum. There is no real extras, with the exception of some pretty short interviews. Another slight insult is the art work on the inter sleave it's the hand link but the one used in the later part of season two. They could have added some production art and maybe pictures of the props and sets. They should have released this the way they are releasing the Sliders set seasons 1&2 in the same box.The video quality is real good so it has that going for it."
3,Extras Stink - Just watch episodes,"Not as many episodes for your money in the first season. And all the extras on the DVDs are pretty silly to me. While I am a Scott Bakula fan, he's loosing esteem in my book because of all the silly things he says in the interviews before each episode. It really takes the punch out of the episode itself & it makes him look like an arrogant light-weight - sorry to say it, Scott! Also, the written description of each episode is redundant and something I don't want to see before watching it. It gives everything away. So my recommendation is: JUST WATCH THE EPISODES AND SKIP ALL THAT OTHER ROT. If you're a Quantum Leap fan, of course, you have to start at the beginning, so this is where it all begins. I do like, however that theme of ""Sam"" wanting to reconnect with his father and the ""Going Home"" theme song goes through the entire series."
4,fun,i enjoyed this series when i was younger it was fun to repeat the experience all over again thanks for it
5,I fell in love all over again....,"I started out with the 1st season and now await the delivery of the 5th season...If ever there was a TV character to fall in love with it was Dr. Sam Beckett! These episodes are as great today as they were ""back in the day"". Dean Stockwell (Al) is just as cute and funny and Scott Bakula (Sam) just as ""hot"". I loved the interviews and the quality is great! One of televisions most imaginative creations, something that is sorely lacking in the swamp of today's ""reality"" shows. I have introduced the series to my nieces and nephews and they love it! Pay attention TV moguls -- This is Entertainment."
5,this is the best TV show,"This was a great season with some classic episodes. The only thing I didn't like was that this season was so short, but hey you still got 4 full seasons left after this. I say buy it and relive history all over again."
4,not as good as the first one but we desperate fans will take,voyager has finally returned home after being stranded in the delta quadrant for 7 years. but their celebrations are cut short when they discover that a borg virus has broken out on earth and they may be responsible for it. this novel cleverly brings old friends and enemies together to hunt down the cause and also addresses the rights of holograms in a funny and interesting way. i hope ms. golden writes more voyager books and keeps the story alive. of all the star trek shows i think this one has the most potential for good books long after the tv show has left the air.
3,Fair to midlin'...,"...after the adequate cliffhanger setup in ST: Homecoming, I was a bit disappointed w/the resolution in Farther Shore. The recreation of the Borg Queen was inspired but the execution lacked a feeling of menace and terror you'd expect from the Borg Queen. Data and the Doctor worked well but the B story (B' Elanna's search for her mom) and the C story (holograms revolting for their rights) fell short...again, a good idea but ran out of steam. ST:TOS The Lost Years and ST:DS9 Mission Gamma did better w/their relaunches. Voyager's relaunch is satisfactory but lacks the ""wow"" that would have made it memorable..."
3,Better than Homecoming but still lacking,"I must say that I got over many of my hard feelings from the first book of the dulougy after reading this book. Janeway seemed to be back in character as well as most of the crew. Seeing how there was an isolated Starfleet conspiracy made me feel better about how the Voyager crew was treated overall. However, the Borg plotline seemed contrived and out of sync with the rest of the star trek universe. Also much of the book was spent on characters not pertaining to Voyager which became redundant after a while. While the B'Elanna b-plotline was satisfying for the most part, the end made one wonder if Golden remembered who B'Elanna was. With Voyager being my favorite Star Trek series I was sad to see it in such poor form."
2,A disappointing sequel,"I suppose that if you've read Homecoming you have no choice but to read the Farther Shore. Unfortunately, I quickly felt that I was reading this sequel out of necessity rather than for pleasure. The problem lies with Golden's emphasis on secondary characters. I'm sorry, but I didn't buy a Voyager book to read about Harry's girlfriend and all of her cohorts that Voyager's crew hasn't seen for the past 7 years, if ever, to the neglect of the crew. The plot eventually comes back around to our heroes, but by that point I was just about ready to put the book down and forget about it in favor of the Voyager DVD set. And that's a shame, considering how much I enjoyed Christie's Homecoming. Here's hoping the author's next venture follows the Homecoming model rather than that of the Farther Shore."
1,Doesn't come close to living up to its potential,"I was disappointed by part one and hoped that this book would round up all the elements of the first and make them make sense. It failed to do that and worst of all, the author failed to make me care about what happened to Janeway and her fellow conspirators. The ending is bland and forgettable. Here's to hoping that CG will do the characters justice in some future book and (crossing my fingers!) finally resolve the Janeway-Chakotay relationship, which has been broadly hinted at in the two previous ""Voyager"" novels by CG."
3,Nice ideas but thin plot,"Unfortunately, while I was curious as to what happened to the Voyager crew upon return to Earth, the premise and ""adventure"" they go on did not quite hold up to expectations. Weak plot lines and predictable outcomes, it fails to hold up the Star Trek pantheon."
4,A Good & Final Ending To A Great Show!!!,"I had been wanting to read this book for a long while. The book is a good & final ending to a great show, even though some parts of the book don't really fit with the story of voyager and it's crew. Even though the crew have went there different ways and paths since back on earth. They all reunite as a team and crew to save not only Voyager's name and some of the crew but the the Entire Planet Earth from complete destruction!! I would highly recommend any Voyager fan at least read this book esp if you are looking or wondering what happened to the crew once they returned home, since the television show didn't really show any of that."
4,Enjoyed reading the book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It brought back memories of when I use to watch the ST VOY show every week. There was some dialogue from Janeway that seemed out of character(why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5) but besides that, I thought it was a great read."
5,Lund Trifold Bed cover for F150,"Not pleased, product does not fit the contoured bed of the F-150. Could have done a better job with fit when you consider the number of F-150s on the road.Update: Although I was not pleased initially with the fit I am over that now. It's now on my 2nd F150 and still performing well. Had a warranty issue a year or so ago and this company does what it says. I will always consider Lund first due to my experience with their customer service."
1,Poor Quality,"Blurry & uneven display. Attempting to load drivers packaged with it draws a stern warning that they are not Windows certified and it is recommended that they not be installed. Sustantial difference in side-by-side comparison (same computer, same video card) with the Acer 1916W."
1,One Year LATER - IT DOESNT WORK,"I've had mine for 1 year now. The monitor keeps going into sleep mode and is unusable. Tech support has not been very responsive. I'll let you know if I get any answers. It has been about 3 weeks now. I had to switch back to my big Dell monitor, but at least it works great."
4,Works nice with 1440x900.,"My only concern is there is one pixel abnormal: when the screen goes blank, that pixel still remains blue. I hope it doesn't matter too much."
2,Not Worth Your Money,"My twins were really excited about the shape sorter at the sitter's. When I saw this Baby Einstein shape toy I was excited. They love the Einstein animals and it seemed like this toy would be great for teaching shapes, colors and animals all in one. Unfortunately, this is my least favorite of our ""Einstein"" products. First, the shapes have stickers on them, which my 14 month old twins immediately chewed off. Now we can't see the animals. The shapes are basic and are easy to match up; however, due to the angle of the turtle's shell, it's very hard for the girls to press the shape into the space hard enough for the music to come on. They get very frustrated with it. They quickly learned how to push the tiny button located in each space, to make the music go. Really, this toy is nothing but a sound machine. If you're looking for a shape sorter, I'd find something cheaper and more basic."
1,watch out for the stickers,I bought this item for my 6 month old son. I found that the stickers come off easily if a child places the blocks in his/her mouth. My son does have teeth and the stickers were easily removed by him. He really enjoyed the toy but I had to remove the blocks as I could not remove all of the adhesive from them.
1,Very disappointed,"My son received this toy for his first birthday from his Grandmother. Unfortunately, it was a waste of money. The shapes fall out of their slots and the stickers began peeling off the minute we took it out of the package. If that weren't bad enough, he is really not interested in it."
2,LOUD! LOUD! LOUD!,"I received this as a shower gift before my son was born, but didn't really encourage him to start playing with it until he was able to sit up on his own because it is made of hard plastic. The Turtle is heavy enough to hurt someone when my son slings it around. The shapes fall out, and there isn't anywhere to store the shape so the are all over my house. The only real entertainment my son gets from the Turtle is pushing the ""Shapes, Colors, Animals"" button OVER AND OVER AND OVER. For now, it keeps his attention. But it is the loudest toy he has by far and there is no volumn control. I am concerned when he plays with it on the floor and lays down beside it becase the sound is really loud for little ears."
2,Very Disappointed,"The turtle as a learning tool was very desirable, however, the shapes do not stay in their appropriate place and my toddler becomes easily frustrated. The musical response cannot be controlled and becomes annoying.I was very disappointed in this toy and am concerned that after Disney bought the company that they would place their emphasis on merchandising and not enough on quality. Only time will tell."
1,Needs an OFF Button!,My daughter received this toy at her 1st birthday and it is my least favorite toy! There is no off button or volume control and it is very annoying as previous people have said. To be honest I'm not a big fan of Baby Einstein products.
1,Agreed... Waste of Money!,"Oh how I wish I had read the other reviews before wasting money on this toy! I figured since it was Baby Einstein, it would have some educational value and be exciting for my child. NOT! Just read the other reviews and sign me up for the bandwagon. The only thing it could be considered useful for is a big,loud, annoying teething toy, as my daughter likes to chew on the turtle's snorkel."
1,Loud and annoying,"I love the baby einstein videos and thought their toys would be just as good. This turtle is one of the worst toys I have yet purchased for my kids. It is very loud, has no on/off switch and no volume control. The four shapes come loose easily and don't stay with the toy - so it is difficult to store and keep together. I have actually placed this in the ""give away"" box because it just isn't worth the trouble. Stick with the videos..."
1,TOO LOUD!!!,"Cute turtle, but way too loud! There's no volume control and the pieces are hard to get to stay in the spaces on the turtle. Give it 5 minutes and you'll get sick of hearing ""SHAPES, ANIMALS,COLORS!"" Yard sale, here it comes..."
2,Noisy and Annoying!,I received this as a gift and I wish I never took it out of the box. I wish so bad that I could return this. It is the loudest toy and it keeps playing the same stuff over and over extremely loud. The stickers fall off on there own and the blocks fall out of the turtle too easy making it impossible for a child to place the block in the turtle by themselves. There is no volume control or an on/off switch. This is not a good toy and I am so disappointed. Baby Einstein has so many wonderful toys and I got stuck with a dud!! This is a toy with potential but Baby Einstein needs to take it back to the drawing board.
1,Worst toy purchased to date,"My 10 month old twins received this as a gift when they were about 6 months old. It is incredibly loud with no volume switch or on off switch. The shapes are always falling off of it, and do not stay in, the most fun my girls have with this toy is playing with the shapes in another room away from the turtle. I love Baby Einstein products, but would never recommend this toy."
3,"Annoying for parents, ok for babies","This shape sorter needs a volume control and an off switch. The only reason that I gave it 3 stars is that my 10 month old son likes it, but it is very annoying for parents. He pushes the botton on top that lights up and says ""Shapes Colors Animals"" in a loud voice. He also likes the size of the blocks to chew on. However the animal images on the blocks are coming off as he scrapes his teeth on them. I thought that the shapes would fall inside the shell like an old fashioned shape sorter, but they only go half way into the shell. It is hard for me to get them into place, so I imagine that it will be hard for my son when he gets older, too. The turtle is cute and seems to be surviving getting beaten, drooled on and stepped on."
2,Extremely annoying,"My mother bought this for my son and, after just a few days, the thing was grating on my nerves. My son quickly learned that he could simply push the big yellow button on the top and get a big reward of music and lights (while I get a headache from the same words and song over and over). He has no interest in putting the shapes in their places, in fact, when a shape is put in place, the toy just states what it is with no music. The button on top is way more fun to push. &#60;br /&#62;<br />This may have been easier to take, but the toy is also VERY loud with no volume control or on/off switch other than taking the batteries out.&#60;br /&#62;<br />In theory it is a great idea - teaching colors, shapes, and animals - but kids are not encouraged to put the shapes in the appropriate slots since they get an easier reward by just pushing the big button."
1,lose your mind,"there is no off button!!! the voice just grates on my nerves as it almost never stops unless you put the whole thing in an untouchable, never moving place. it is sitting at the top of my son's closet, and i never want to see it again. so many better things to spend one's money on, esp. for a baby."
1,AGONIZING TORTURE!!,"It is beyond me how hi-tech and intuitive some childrens toys can be, yet some manufacturers forget something as crucial as an ON/OFF switch! This thing is loud and obnoxious with no volume or on/off switch. Not only that - but you can't even take out the batteries without a phillips screwdriver - so much for a workaround.It's really sad because it's a good concept for a learning toy. If you're into going slowly insane, then go ahead and buy it. I, personally, would rather have my ankle crushed."
1,Not good for teethers,"My daughter is 9 months old and loves the shapes, she loves to play with them and put them in her mouth (along with everything else she can get her hands on) but to my surprise she ate when of the sticker off! I called Baby Einstein and the manufacturer to express my concerns and they assured me that the materials are non toxic and non choking hazzards. I was relieved but annoyed that they would put stickers that come off on a toy for the age range 6mos+ when we all know everything goes into the mouth. Baby Einstein told me they are no longer making this toy but not for the reason I gave, the rep said she didnt know why. The manufactuer also told me their contract w/Baby Einstein is up however, they are sending me a replacement Baby Einstein toy. Bottom line is I wouldn't recommend this toy and if you have one that is damaged by normal activity call the manufacturer and they will send you a replacement toy of your choice from what they have left in their stock."
1,Murders and Inquisitions,"The book is actually a farce--one of the authors is currently employed by Columbia (at least that's what I gathered from the credits), the other seems to be your typical middle-management consultant. So much for unabiased analysis. NOWHERE does any one discuss the government case against Columbia/HCA. The FBI raids are mentioned but there is no discussion whatsoever about what precipitated them, what evidence was found, and what the governments case ultimately proved to be.One great line does stand out: ""If anything can cast a pall over a leadership retreat, it's an FBI raid.""The book does point out a glaring omision in analysis of health care policy. There needs to be an indepth analysis of what went on (and is going on) with Columbia/HCA. This book, however, is not it."
3,"Mergers and acquisitions, acquisitions and mergers!","If you can get through all the pages of mergers and acquisitions, the book does a very through job of explaining Columbia/HCA's corporate philosophies and what happened that led to their downfall."
2,Erasers didn't fit my pencil,"I ordered the erasers to fit my .9mm Cross mechanical pencil. They did not fit. That pencil requires a .6mm eraser which doesn't seem to be available except at great expense. I thought the .5mm might do the job, but they don't. I may try cutting my own from large hand held erasers if I can find a tool to cut them with."
1,Too Small for standard cross pens,"The erasers are too small in diameter to fit a standard cross pen. Also, if they did fit, the erasers are very short and would wear out quickly. An inferior product."
2,Didn't fit my Cross pencil,These erasers were for my 30 year old Cross pencil since I can't find them locally. They didn't fit my pencil althought they are listed as the correct size because they are not thick enough to stay in the pencil. I took another reviewer's advice and purchased Clic eraser refills to cut to length for my pencil.
2,Brillian thinkers -- but all white and male...Hm....?,"Once again, the racial and gendered biases of the sociological cannon blare loud and strong.It is simply a joke that this volume doesn't include anything on Charelotte Perkins Gilman (who wrote volumes of social theory -- see WOMEN AND ECONOMICS for starters)and, it is appaling that this volume of ""masters"" doesn't include a section/chapter on the single greatest sociologist and social theorist ever to grace the United States with his wisdom and penetrating social analysis, W.E.B. Du Bois -- see THE SOCIAL THEORY OF WEB DU BOIS for starters.Shame on Coser...Get with the program. Sociology and social theory are more than what you were taught in graduate school forty years ago."
1,Not Super Audio CD,This is not a Super Audio CD and the product description needs to be corrected to reflect this.
2,I would give it 2.5/5 but no more...,"Very generic and slightly dull 90s R&B. Almost all mid-tempo. She's a capable singer, but there's nothing here that hasn't been done better by someone else. Some upbeat tracks and ballads would definitely have balanced things out alot more."
1,"Ordinary songs, ordinary singing ......................",She has a good voice but doesn't know how to use it to maximum advantage. Deborah Cox is a guest - now there's a girl who knows how to sing!
2,"Wait, Warner Brothers WILL restore Popeye in 2007",Warner Brothers is in the process of restoring the classic B&W and Color Popeye Cartoons for a 2007 release. Original Paramount main & end titles will be a part of the restoration.
5,A must-read for every high school English student!!,"My son just told me they are reading ""Romeo and Juliet"" in freshman high school English. I immediately rememberd reading this book when I was in school and being in hysterics. Even with the passage of time, I think my son will get a kick out of it, so I was thrilled to be able to find a couple of used versions of it on Amazon; ordered one for my son (and for me to re-read) and one for his teacher! Hope she has a sense of humor!!"
3,Average at best,"I have owned mine for about a year now. On the up side, it does generally make good waffles, evenly cooked (though the top not quite as much as the bottom). My biggest issues with this model are:1) Messy. There is not much overflow so we either end up with a mess, or waffles that are not whole because we didn't put in enough batter (to avoid overflow). Also, when there is overflow (and believe me there will be) the edge on the bottom is poorly designed in that it catches the batter. So you will end up small amounts of batter hardened along the bottom edge.2) Control knob broke. The knob on the front broke off shortly after getting the unit. When this happens, *DON'T* try to adjust the temperature dial with your fingers or you will get burned!At this point, I am wishing I had a different waffle maker. Sorry Cuisinart; but this needed to be designed a little better for this amount of dough."
2,great waffles at first,"We have been making waffles every other week for years. When first purchased, after a short break-in period, this waffle maker was great. After a few years, sticking started to be a problem which became worse over the last year. Finally, we had to abort a waffle breakfast because of severe sticking. Close inspection showed that the Teflon coating on the plates was peeling off. I hope no one got a waffle with that ""supplement"". I did notice that the coating was quite thin. Maybe you should only expect to get about a hundred batches from a Teflon iron before replacement, but I really hate to participate in a disposable economy."
1,Consider another brand...,"I will have to say that for the first 1 1/2 years this was great. I cooked my waffles evenly and beeped when it was ready. When I pulled it out to use it a few weeks ago it would not cook my waffles evenly. The bottom browned perfectly but the top just would not cook. I tried everything... I changed my recipe, plugged it in another plug, I even bought a new one. However, the new one cooked the same way. I am not sure if it is an element or what but I will be returning the new one and throwing out the old one. Now I am on a mission to find another brand. My kids are missing their waffles."
5,love this gadget!,"My daughter gave this to me and my husband this past summer when they came to stay for a few days, we were thrilled! it looks good, easy cleaning and make great waffles! we never make pancakes anymore since we got this:) As far as the beeper going off to often I wonder if that person realize that one should let it warm again after the lid as been open to remove the first cooked waffles-this is what the beeper is for-which is a good feature otherwise the waffles don't brown enough-done that! I would buy another like one just like this for ourselves if this one ever gave out...Oh! one other thing we use applesauce or any red jelly on our waffles-les cals."
3,Cuisinart Waffle Maker,"The first time out of the box the machine made nice waffles. The second time we tried a recipe from a cook book that we had used previously and it stuck to the plates and made a mess, even though there was sufficient oil in the batter and on the plates. We wanted to try a crispier waffle but setting the temperature above 4 seems to be ""too high"" so we keep it on 4 and get nice looking and tasting waffles that are soft, not crisp. If anyone has a suggestion for a recipe and settings to get crispy waffles please let us know. Overall not a bad machine, but it needs to be """"tweeked to make waffles the way we like them. We also noted that it makes waffles almost too fast, in about 1-1/2 minutes."
2,Belgian Waffles Stick!,The waffles stick to the plate and it was very difficult to remove them without crumbling into pieces.
1,Take Your Pick - Cooked or RAW!,"I've been making great waffles on an inexpensive little Betty Crocker model for ten years.I did hours of 'homework' before ordering this Cuisinart 4-slice waffle maker & used it as soon as it arrived to cook up an entire box of waffle mix. Sure enough, the waffler cooked the rear two waffles exactly as programmed. However, in every batch, the front edges of the forward two waffles turned out WHITE, mushy, & difficult to remove! It was also impossible to comletely fill out the waffles without the mix running out over the front into the unprotected electronic controls. I called Cuisinart to make sure I'd used the appliance correctly & their customer service representative could only conclude that the waffle iron was faulty. For this kind of price tag, that's outrageous! It was shipped back within 24 hours. We're reverting to an inexpensive model, which we'll just toss & replace every few years."
1,Eurppean Voltage is 220/240,I have already reported to you that the Cuisinart Waffle IRON THAT ARRIVED WAS SUITABLE ONLY FOR AMERICAN VOLTAGE and therefore unuseable here in Irelamd.For this reason my purchase is useless. Please contact the suppliers Beach Camera . Tom Carton
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This review is a little tardy. I actually bought this tape a couple years ago but just now came across the review request e-mail.When I ordered this tape I was hoping it was something I had seen back in the late 80s or early 90s where one of Kevin Pollack's bits was about Brian Boitano at the Winter Olympics. Unfortunately that show must have been one of the hour long comedy specials on HBO. This tape is not his best work by any means, but it does have a few funny moments.My suggestion is to avoid this one and see if you can get a DVD copy of the HBO show. It is hilarious."
2,Esoteric and Theory-based,"This book is quite esoteric and very theory-based. I was looking more for a book that would assist me in learning to use accupressure rather than understand it's development and philosophy. For anyone interested in a book that is more aimed at treatment, try Acupressure Potent Points: A Guide to Self-Care for Common Ailments by Michael Gach, an excellent resource."
1,Binding fell apart at first reading.,The book is great. It is just what I was looking for - acupressure points for healing. However the book and binding are very old and the binding fell apart and all pages are loose now.
5,Period Instrument Mozart at its Best,"By far the best W. A. Mozart set in my collection of Classical Music Compact Discs, certainly being all the more reflective of eighteenth century Vienna, Salzburg & c. for being played on, what I can only believe to be authentic period instruments, or replicas of the same. A volume well worthy of the very highest accolades."
3,depeche mode=great; for the masses=tragic,"I'm a big dpeche mode fan. I gave this disc a try because, well I had nothing better to spend on. There are mostly losers here, a few great tracks (Smashing Pumpkins, MeatBeat, MonsterMagnet, Failure), and two worth the whole purchase. While I'm not that big into the Cure, their version of ""World In My Eyes"" evokes great emotion and even energy, and is a very good listen. The biggest standout, however, is the Deftones' version of ""To have and To Hold."" Chino's vocals are really great, and give the feeling that the words may actually be his. The instrumentals are supremely heavy. Overall, I would say that this version is better than the original. Once I heard it, I could not help but to continue playing it over and over. Very solid song."
1,Not worth it,"Can anybody really do a cover of a Depeche Mode song without literally copying the song right down to each synthesizer riff? This album proves both answers. Smashing Pumpkins and The Cure do decent and well-received versions of two good songs, but everything else just doesn't say Depeche Mode. DM has a sound that few can imitate, and this album only shows that some bands suck at it. Did they really expect people to accept Rammstein doing a cover of ""Stripped""? It sucks so bad...as do most of the other covers here. If the NIN version of ""Personal Jesus"" were here, it might be a saving grace, but overall, get the original versions. It is far more rewarding to listen to than this garbage."
2,"More of an insult, actually.","Some (not all, thankfully) of Depeche Mode's best songs have been remade by todays leading MOR bands, and the results are almost obscene. Germany's excuse for Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, does a particularly bad cover of ""Stripped"", it sounds like a rude noise coming from them, while the Smashing Pumpkins do a laughable version of ""Never Let Me Down Again. The rest is a mixture of second rate rock songs, which don't even have a bit of the brilliance of the original songs by Depeche Mode."
1,Oh my God this thing is awful!,"Never have a heard such a basterdization of one could once be called good music. Rammstein's ""Stripped"" is done about as poorly as would be possible. And Smashing Pumpkin's version of ""Never Let Me Down Again"" is simply the worst rendition of a great song. Don't be a hero and try to sit through this one. If you like Depeche Mode, buy the Singles Collection. But if you want to hear nails scraping a chalkboard...this is the album for you!"
2,By far the worst tribute I've ever heard!,"For a DEPECHE MODE tribute album this is sad. The only good versions worth listening are the ones done by The Smashing Pumpkins, ThE CuRe, and the Deftones. The rest is all garbage. Example: Rammstein, I would expect something good but they sound like cave men. This album should have never hit the stores."
2,Go to song #1 and #4,"This was far from a tribute. It was, however, a collection of no-name bands using this project as a means of advertising themselves, not as a tribute to anyone. The Cure and the Smashing Pumpkins gave the best efforts here, although one wonders what made Cure-god Robert Smith decide to do a DM song. Is this the same guy who openly criticized DM for many years?"
1,if you're buying this based on the cure song... think twice!,"the cure song is total rubbish... perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years... then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song... for shame... another reviewer said the smashing p. song was junk (laughable?) but i disagree... i think it's much better than the original song... but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest... the sp ver. has a better groove and the vocals are better delivered... again, the cure song sux... c'ya (ps i only listened to those 2 songs... then sold it to a used cd store... the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)"
4,"for some, but not for all","I'm not a huge Depeche Mode fan, but I really like this tribute album. It's a solid album, but if you're a die-hard Mode fan, you might not like this one."
5,This CD is definitely for the masses.,"I work at a radio station and got the CD earlier this week. Their are some very interesting songs on here. Interpretations of the muisc range from very close to the original, to kind of ""loungy"". This is a CD I think even non-fans of Depeche Mode will like. Some highlights include ""world in my eyes"" by The Cure, as well as the songs by Smashing Pumpkins, Failure, and Dishwalla."
4,pretty good stuff...,"Well, I never even considered buying this type of ""tribute"" album before, until I read pretty good reviews of it. And I agree with them. In general the new versions are good, different, etc. and bring a new sound to the old DM standards. Especially recommended are tunes by Smashing Pumpkins, God Lives Underwater, The Cure, Self, Rabbit in the Moon. Pretty good and/or interesting are Veruca Salt, Hooverphonic, Locust. Pretty standard and marginal are Dishwalla (straight up ""alternative"" rock), (surprisingly) Meat Beat Manifesto (pretty true to the original... uncool), and Deftones (pretty unoriginal version). Pretty bad is Monster Magnet (who are these grunting fools?). Truly rank is Rammstein ""Stripped""... one of my all time favorite songs ruined, wrecked, and destroyed by comically bad German-accented ""hard-core"" delivery (bad news). In summary, pretty good stuff, you won't be disappointed in the least."
2,THIS IS A TRIBUTE TO DEPECHE MODE?!,"Depeche Mode is one of the most sensual groups I have ever known. NON-DM fans WOULD appreciate this cd - more so than DM fans. Most of the tracks on this cd are ear-splitting and annoying. Sensual has turned into Angry. Even so, the Smashing Pumpkins version of Never Let Me Down Again is excellent and there are various glimmers of beauty in a couple of the tracks."
3,Hit and Miss,"just as you'd expect from a 3-star review, there's some really cool stuff and some bad stuff on this album. i read a lot of reviews and i've concluded the 5-star people are kidding themselves. 5-stars? there's definitely some crap on this album; but it's worth buying if you're familiar with and like most DM singles. and the 1-star people...wow. so shallow. way too obsessed with what they think DM and their songs should like. they just cannot handle a fresh interpretation of some good songs. some songs i like the original better; some songs i like the remix better. either way, it's an interesting albumjust for fun: next time you're entertaining some friends play ""stripped"". put the track on when no one is paying attention. now time how long it takes before someone says ""what the f**k is this crap""but there's a lot of cool tracks too ;)"
1,MINDLESS MUSIC FOR THE MINDLESS MASSES,"If you are a self-loathing manic depressive who wears pointy shoes and black fingernail polish then you probably own this already, the 80's were a horrible decade for music and trying to revive it with newer bands is equally bad."
3,DM needs no tribute - They are so alive and kicking!,"Yes, the material in the disc are passable. But Depeche Mode doen't need the accolade afforded to dis-banded bands (no pun intended). But a tribute is a tribute is a tribute. It only shows that DM has put out so much good music that great as well as up and coming groups are willing to do a cover. Imagine THE CURE doing a D MODE song? The project was all worth it though. I bought the CD to complete my Depeche Mode collection. If you're an all-out DM (like me since 1984), get the CD - but do not expect too much."
2,Not exactly a tribute,"Besides the Smashing Pumpkins and the Cure, this album is mish-mash of up-and-coming artists who should work on thier own albums first. If buying buy the cassette only."
5,just reporting a mistake,You list in tracks 2 and 5 policy of truth by Dishwalla twice. I believe track 2 is Fly on a windshield by God Lives Underwater. Please correct web page
1,"Quickly sticky, very fragile","I bought this cooking set and was very unhappy with it. The handles of two of the pots broke quite rapidly. And the non-stick material in the pot deteriorated fast; I guess one can make it last longer by being more careful but still. The red paint on the outisde of the pots also goes off! Really very low quality.If you want a good non-tick pot, go for Calphalon or Tfal."
3,"Silly, entertaining, but not a good intro to Yeoh","A group of Chinese special agents are sent to take down a Hong Kong drug lord. The agents are as much a family as they are a special police unit (they were all chosen due to being orphaned at an early age). Along the way, one of them falls for Michelle Yeoh's character, the girlfriend/reluctant partner of the bad guy... Why am I bothering to tell you the plot? The plot is simply an excuse for some corny romance, some occasional melodramatics, some adequate fu and not nearly enough Michelle Yeoh. It's silly and entertaining, with an occasionally hilarious subtitling job and a couple moments of style (watch where Michelle keeps her pistol... it's not where you think, either...). If you want to introduce someone to Michelle Yeoh's work, show them Wing Chun. If you want to have a six-pack and a bad kung fu movie (""bad"" meant in a good way), grab this."
3,Just remember...,"This is a good compilation of Tommy Boyce & Bobby Hart recordings, starting with Tommy's Dion-like recording ""I'll Remember Carol"" from 1962. Then, we jump ahead to 1966 for another Tommy solo recording, followed by several Boyce & Hart recordings. The CD closes with five Dolenz, Jones, Boyce & Hart songs (I'm sure you know who Dolenz and Jones are). There are a lot of good songs here, but there are also some rather unremarkable tracks included. Fans of '60s pop music should enjoy it."
4,Great accessory,This was a great idea. I had been searching everywhere for hanging hooks or a rack that did not have to be attached to my new cabinets. I love having my kitchen tools hanging for easy access.
2,For Beatlemaniacs Only,"Only serious Beatle fans would be able to follow this DVD as its very disorganized. There were a few short moments of Beatles interview footage that I had never seen, but on the whole there's not anything new here and I found it rather boring.The box says its going to give you details on the Beatles early years, but there really wasn't much of that. A large segment of the DVD is simply an interview with the actor Victor Spinetti.Like the other reviewer said there are worse DVDs out there, but this is certainly not an essential one."
2,Can we milk this dry any further?,"I only saw this at a friends house. This was a kind of fun DVD, but rather cheaply put together.The thing is, their history is continually being stuffed down our throats. And they seem like the only classic band that Big Network Media will ""allow"" 2-hour prime time specials on them to this day. (""How dare we put the 'The Kids are Alright' in place of '8 Simple Rules' and 'Jim', leave that to VH-1...oh, The Beatles?....oh, OK""!)As much as I love the Beatles, this DVD seems like another bandwagon-job. And no other classic band gets any contemporary spotlight for some reason. It's always these guys. McCartney's constant camera-hogging these days doesn't help much either, bless him.Next, we'll be having documentaries on their favorite food."
3,A product past its prime.,"If you want to experiment with printing your jpeg files, this cartridge will last for about 10 8 x 10 enlargements; and if you figure testing your software settings will use up at least a few of these, this is as cost ineffective a product as you can buy. Invest in a better printer. You'll have eaten up a few hundred dollars in cartridges in a month with this product, and if you buy a refurbished or generic version, you'll get what you pay for: refurbished, generic photos."
2,Missing Colors,I have purchased this product before. Other than the anticipated low yield there were no other problems. However my recent purchase of theLexmark Color Inkjet Cartridge (10N0227)did not produce any colors in the blue green family of colors. After a quick purchase of a new cartridge at Wal-Mart everything worked fine.
2,JUNK,"Overpriced and dries up too fast.....I used the option of color printing 3 times in 3 months, 4th attempt within 3 month period found all but blue dried up. Not Amazon's fault, but just poor design...."
4,Coloring Your Printers,"I arguably can tell if a cartridge for your printer can be a great purchase. From Lexmark, the leaders in quality inkjet printers and cartridges, they have definitely made one of those happen. The color inkjet cartridge for inkjet printers from the Z600 series, is a very convient and simple to use package, that conviently stores a lot of ink for you printer in need. It is inexpensive, affordable and compact. Although this won't work in every printer, it still is a vital tool for Lexmark printer owners. I own the Lexmark Z615 printer, and I use this tool everyday I need to. If you own one of those printers, you'll need this as well.Price: B+Convience: A-Overall: B+"
4,Just what I remembered,"I remember this from when I was a kid, and my kids love it now. It's not DVD quality - so basically you're watching what was originally made for VHS tapes with something that plays in DVD players. But considering it hasn't been remade or anything, you take what you can get."
2,wrong item shipped,I received the wrong dvd in the mail. If you look back at your records you will see I hade problemes getting the dvd I wanted in the first place. I was sent a Birthday dvd and not Grandpas Magical Toys. This has been very frustating as it was a gift. I am hoping to resolve this.
5,"WE CONSIDER THIS VIDEO ""OUR LIFE SAVER""","EVER SINCE OUR SON WAS 4 MONTHS OLD WE CAN BE ASSURED HE'LL BE TOTALLY HOOKED TO THE VIDEO THROUGHOUT IT'S ENTIRITY. WE ARE ORDERING ALL THE OTHER WEE SING VIDEOS SINCE HE WATCHES THE ADVERTISEMENTS AT THE END OF GRANDPA'S MAGICAL TOYS. LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWS, WE SING THE SONGS TO HIM AND HE RECOGNIZES THEM ALL. IT'S THE BEST VIDEO FOR SMALL CHILDREN (UNDER A YEAR) THAT WE'VE FOUND."
5,One of our favorite all-time movies!,"What should you do, Punchanello funny fellow? What should you do, Punchanello funny you?The answer is...you should buy this movie! First of all, you will absolutely LOVE it, and secondly, you will understand the meaning of these questions...We are both 15 years old and we STILL love watching it and all the other Wee Sing videos...You may think we're crazy but buy the movies and you'll understand why we love them so much!"
3,Grampa's Magical Toys,"This movie isn't as good as other productions I've seen, like Wee Sing together. It's not too bad though. I bought it for my niece, and she seemed to like it ok.I am glad that in the product information I could see how long the movie was."
3,Love Wee Sing but not this one!,"Good story, but it's kind of dark, I mean dark as in the color is hard to see even on DVD! But my kids are bored with it! Their favorites are Wee SIng the original and Wee Sing in Sillyville"
5,Another good wee sing product,"This is another of Wee Sing's great videos for kids. My grandkids love the Wee Sing videos, and this is no exceptions. They've added this to their list of favorites."
5,A musical adventure,"I rate all the wee sing videos as five star, the reason is I've found them all entertaining.(My husband says that the tape is for the child and not for me!!!) This one has alot of the songs that I sang as a child and it brings back memories of a very happy childhood. There are rhymes about jumping rope and songs for clapping games and songs with scottish dancers, even a song about a merry go round --- very exciting!"
4,"Bizzare, but in a good way!","I copped this album after getting into the whole LA underground scene. I'll admit that the first couple listens, I didn't care for more than a couple of tracks, but after multiple plays, I was humming some of the music. The MCs don't always rhyme, but thats OK. The music often doesn't sound like any hip hop beat ever produced, but that works too. A truly unique crew, the Shape Shifters should be proud of their originality."
3,"Great Story And Plot, But Writing??","This a sexy, romantic tale of a bounty hunter falling in love with his prey. The plot and story was great, characters well developed, and it kept my interest because of the imagination and storytelling of the sex scenes, but for some reason, I was confused throughout this book trying to comprehend the author's writing. It was confusing and very choppy at times and it took away from the story.Overall ratings: 2.5 (**1/2) stars."
3,In the name of all that is holy in GOOD writing...,"...stop using exclamation points. One, most men do not think in exclamation points. Two, good writers don't use them...well, if they do, it is so limited that it is difficult to find in their books. There must be 50 in the first 25 pages of this book. That's all I can say at this point, because I can't get past the abusive punctuation."
4,"nice read,...if you dare","truth or dare is one of those books that can be read when you don't have anything to do,or just plain bored. it was a nice interesting read, that also included humor,steamy sex,and a romantic plot that made the book interesting. i wasn't disappointed. not bad at all..."
5,One of the best cookbooks in print!,"Since breakfast is our most important meal of the day this certainly will help a cook prepare fantastic meals for a great start. Being a visual learner, the pictures are works of art! The book contains a wonderful glossary of Italian ingredients, that a cook/shopper could buy at any large grocery store. Don't let the title deceive you - many of the recipes, especially the pasta meals could be served any time of day. As an owner of many cookbooks this has become one of my top favorites! Mangia!"
4,entertainment pure and simple,"When academy award winning director Oliver Stone who is well known for his historic views on war and politics shown in moviessuch as JFK,PLATOON,BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,and WALL STREET.In this one he takes a look at the media and it's obbesesion withviolence in America.Woody Harrelson(KINGPIN,CHEERS) and the hotJueliete Lewis(KALIFORNIA) star as the psycotic couple on a deadly crime spree through the Mid West.People have said this is Stoneat is worst and it was just a total waist of talent I disagree every director has to have one guilty pleasure.Brian De Palma hadBODYDOUBLE,Oliver Stone has NATURAL BORN KILLERS.With a great cast inccluding Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Sizemore and hard hittingmusic by Nine Inch Nails and Janes Addiction.Full of gore and gunplay,sex,and strong languege an original script by Qeuntin Tarantino(PULP FICTION)NATURAL BORN KILLERS is a entertaining great flick for any bizzare and violent/black humor fan."
4,Hate to disagree...But I must!!!!,"I guess almost everyone missed the point Stone was trying to make here. Social Satire! He pokes fun at everything in sight, from the exagerated actions of our two anti-heroes (Harrelson & Lewis), the hypocrisy of rating-hungry sensationalistic ""tv"" reporters (Downey), to the justice system and the corrupt fools who run it, to law enforcement in general, even to the capture scene with the police resorting to barbaric measures for no reason whatsoever! Not to mention a miniscule supporting roll for Dangerfield that was worthy of an Academy Award in my book! No, I am not a sick person who laughs at car accidents or mass-murder, nor do I condone the actions of Harrelson and Lewis as socially acceptable. I just enjoy a great flick, and this is one!"
5,could it get any better? yes!,"the original release of Natural Born Killers was a whirlwind of controversy. thought as too violent, a meaningless bloodbath. this is a total missconception of the real film. NBK follows the killing spree across america of mickey and mallory knox. what makes this film so special is the intence story that only tarentino could produce with the brilliant directing of oliver stone. NBK directors cut is even better than the original, adding extra footage that really should not have been edited from the original release. the only problem i found with the vhs is it lacks the court room scene. this was a great dissapointment, because after reading that section of the script, there was nothing i would have liked to see more than mickey's cross examination. overall though a brilliant film, that just keeps getting better and better."
3,Stone and his satirical films...,"Media vs. murderers. Who is the demon and who is the angel? Well, Oliver Stone makes the case that there is that fine line and sometimes we step over that line into that other side. The real demons in our world are portrayed in a kind of super-hero fashion. The more evil, the more you want to be closer to the action. So, what Stone does here works very well, and it paints a vivid and unholy picture of human nature in general. Watching this movie leaves you with a numb feeling - and I would guess that's the way Stone wants it."
1,Huh?,"This movie has to be one of the most boring and disgusting movies ever made. It is hard to imagine that a person responsible for the making of a sensible classic like JFK would also be responsible for the making of this - what? It is, from the outset, not clear what this thing is trying to say and then it gets worse. The characters are incredible and the plot possesses in itself nothing to hold an audience."
1,Utter Garbage,"The only film that I've seen where I wanted to walk out of the theater. Is Oliver Stone insane? Yes, I understand that this was a critical fave and that Stone is a ""pioneer"" in showing emotion through imagery, but this was too extreme. I literally had a headache after this film (Stone employs all the different film aspects: 35 mm, 8 mm, B/W, animation). I wasn't impressed by the ""media's sensationalism of crime"" message that was subliminally put forth. Subliminal nothing. You're knocked over the head with it!Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis play a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. Their crime sprees and murders are documented by Robert Downey Jr who plays a tabloid television reporter. While the crimes these two commit are heinous, Stone paints them as likable characters (at least that's what he wants the audience to feel).Word of advice: Instead of returning this movie to the video drop at your local Blockbuster, throw it in the trash where it belongs."
1,Wretched,"Previous reviewers have said you'll either love or hate this movie - well, put me down as the latter. Stone's ""message"" seems to be that violence is perpetuated and glorified by the media. Gee, thanks Ollie! He doesn't just lay it on with a trowell, but with a bulldozer. Pitched at the intellectual level of a retarded slug, this reprehensible, self-important, mess of a movie isn't even in the ""so bad it's good"" category. In Hollywood, no-one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of their audience. An absolute dog."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"It's Oliver Stone. It's OTT. It's stars are Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. It boasts Robert Downey Jnr's and Tommy Lee Jones's worst screen performances. Rodney Dangerfield is in it. Tarantino removed his name from the screenplay he was so disgusted at what they had done to it. Told straight, it could have been a good movie, a very good hard-hitting movie, instead it's a not very funny, not very well told parody of a movie that fails to get its message across because it's as subtle as a brick and sinks like one..."
2,Time has not been kind.,"when I was 14 I thought this film was a cinematic achievement. But now looking back at it, I don't even really find Bob Richardson's photography that interesting,which is the primary main attraction here as with all of Oliver Stone's films. The Rodney Dangerfield scene however is wonderful, the rest isn't."
1,kevin anderson has got it down!,"ole kevin rented this movie and told me it was ""ishy"". and that's exactly how i feel about it."
1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!,"i never wanted to tear my own eyes out and bang my head on fiery spikes so badly before than when i attempted to watch this movie. i tried a few times giving it the ""old college try"". a person whos opinion i respect highly recommends this this P.O.S. so for his sake and for the sake of conversation i kept trying. i was thinking ""maybe theres something im missing, it cant really be this bad, can it?"" truth is its not that bad, ITS WORSE!!!it wont allow me to tag this movie, my tag for this movie is GARBAGE"
1,yea....eh..,i dont know if you guys know Sarah Edmondson and Ben Darras but they commited 2 crimes after watchingg this movie. Search on google and you will see. I have never seen this movie and I am certainly not going to watch it........
1,"GLORY, GLORY VIOLENT CULTURE","Well...what can we learn from NBK??? It sends the same massage as 13th Friday(and its countless sequels),though people try to make it look like intelligent movie with philosophy behind blood and gore or whatever---it just never works.In the hope of finding a voice against our violent society,unlike what Oliver Stone claimed,NBK is the worst attempt ever made."
2,Sick and twisted.,"Natural Born Killers directed by Oliver Stone is one sick film. I watched this film when I was a teenager and boy this serial killer flick made me physically sick. Woody Harrleson and Juliette Lewis play the love-struck killers and of course Lewis's character was abused as child, jeez you would think so!? The editing of this film is so choppy, hope you don't get motion sickness, stay away from this mess!"
1,TOTAL CHUNNDER,"This is one of the worst films I have seen to date. It is one huge political statement by Oliver Stone. The cast were obviously hard up for cash, which is why they don't put much effort into there acting. Stone should have left this one to someone else, and Tarintino shouldn't have made such a fuss over Stone re-writing the script. Only watch this if you're really bored."
2,A real piece of garbage,"Anyone who says this movie is an artistic representation of society is warped, or else doesn't have a whole lot of upbringing. While this film was artistic, in the manner the film was manipulated and altered, not only to make the work more attractive to the eye, but to also to make certain points in the film evident, it is still a piece of garbage. Violence made with astronomical box office sales in mind. They succeeded.Now, while I say that the movie is purely written to satisfy the American audience's lust for violence, I also like it; I was raised with bloodshed, rape and other forms of ""entertainment"" thrust upon me until I found it to be normal. So, in that respect, this film was entertaining.May the Lord help us all."
2,Director's cut is much better..,I was dissapointet because of this version of the movie.There are so many cuts in relation to the director's cut on my old dvd.
3,"VERY,VERY BIZZARE,BUT...","First things first,Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" has to be one of the most bizzare films in recent history!Bizzare meaning that you can interpet this film two ways,eitheryou'll see it as a crazy,strange physcedlic mess or as a daring,edgy,groundbreaking look into media obession and twisted values.Ultimatly,I look at it as both.The weird editing in ""NBK"" and strong performances by Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis makes this Stone-directed film NOT your average film.If you're a very image-senstive viewer then ""NBK"" won't be your cup of tea but looking for something kooky,unbelieval strange,and mind-bending,you gotta see this one!"
2,Video Quality Varied; Good Audio Soundtrack,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality varied throughout the movie. Some parts were very grainy black and white. Some parts were not-so-good color. Some parts looked high-def color. Some of this was on purpose, for sure. But I'm not sure if the parts that were not-so-good color were on purpose. And, I'm not sure if the black and white scenes were supposed to look as bad as they did.The audio soundtrack (Dolby TrueHD 5.1) was good.The movie about put me to sleep, but, it was late, and I was tired. I do not think this is a great movie."
2,Bonnie & Caligula,"Oliver Stone manfully endeavors to violently critique [ab]use of artificial blood, a trend to which his own arts &/or entertainment produce has contributed substantially over the years. Was Stone always so OBVIOUS? Maybe? The movie is hamfistedly hip/pretentious/cute/surreal, attempted satire, but wishes aren’t horses? Stone projects his usual manic energy, has been operating commercially for decades by romanticizing alienation. The Director’s Cut features a brazen & self-serving explication. Introducing a film that can only be defended as a swipe at professional use/creation of violence as popular amusement stuff (sufficiently effective to twist/.../influence human animals), Stone blithely insists that his own popular amusement stuff is QUITE different, merely reflects us as we are... is NOT aimed squarely at a prevailing taste, perhaps media-assisted, that he claims to abhor. Trust Ollie? It’s ART?..."
5,Trip movie all the way...,This is a movie about two brutal serial killers that are turned into international heroes by the media. It is considered one of the biggest experimental movies of all time. I highly recommend this if you are in the mood to see some people get killed.
1,Hollywood clean up your mess so we don't have to look at it,"Tommy Lee Jones who plays a major role in this movie had a line in an earlier movie where he commented, ""what a mess!"" I can't help but think he was also applying that phrase to this unfortunate flick."
2,blu ray release,"I love this movie, however amazon's site says the blu ray release here is unrated. It's not. The box has it rated R. This is not the Director's Cut. Don't waste your money on this edited release."
5,ROCKS THE HOUSE!! TOTALLY HARDCORE!!!!,THIS MOVIE SHOWS THE NEED FOR STRUCTURIZING THE HOME SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE MICKY AND MALLORY NEVER EXIST. BUT THE RIDE IS ONE HELL OF A ROLLER-COASTER WHILE IT LASTS!!!
4,One of my favourite movies,"I was pretty surprised to see all the negative reviews about this movie, although I agree it's certainly not everyone's cup of tea. The movie is filmed in a very... unique way. It sometimes switches to slow-motion quite suddenly, or becomes black and white, and then back to colour.The plot line itself may not be overly original, but the way it is presented more than makes up for that. I can surely say that I have never seen anything else like it. :) At any rate, 'Natural Born Killers' developed quite a cult following, so you know it can't be as bad as the other reviews make it out to be. I'd say it's definitely worth watching!"
5,DVD,"Natural Born Killers, is a great movie, could be better without the weird back ground stuff. Darrell"
1,This Review Is About The Blu-Ray NOT The Movie!,"I should of followed what one of the people said on here before because I would of never had to return this Blu-Ray. Basically this Blu-Ray has the worst transfer I have ever seen, the picture hops up and down throughout the entire film! I contacted Warner Brothers about this issue and of course I never got back a response. Save yourself money and do not buy this edition of Natural Born Killers!"
1,The ABSOLUTE WORST film ever made,"When director Stone gave viewers Jim Morrison's euphoric, visual perspective of his drunken, drugged journey in ""The Doors,"" it was a hint of what would later come. In-your-face directing, fast edits and psychedelic direction becomes a bore within the first five minutes. This is as cynical as movies get. The plot: the ""media,"" news media that is, plays up serial killers Harrelson and Lewis as heros. The performances are great, but Stone's direction of the film is just awful. Impossible to bare for more than 20 minutes. Most critics and viewers agree. Stick to ""Wild at Heart"" or ""Thelma and Louise."""
1,Pointless Violence... Pointless Viewing,"I'm not opposed to watching a violent movie. I love the Godfather and the Sopranos, The Warriors, and many westerns and assorted other movies (Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, e.g. Dirty Harry) with loads of violence. I'm also aware that this was a satire, a parody, a statement about the sick obsession with violence, blah, blah, blah. Bottom line, you either like the movie or you don't and I found it pointless."
3,Natural Born Killers: The True Review,"I just finished reading some of the reviews and it is clear and easy to see that some of these reviewers have only seen half of the movie, or were not paying any attention while viewing it. This review will help the people like me who wanted an honest, and accurate review of a movie they may not have seen yet.""Natural Born Killers"" is the tale of two lovers who ran away from the unfair, un-cairing, un-loving, ways of their home to start a killing spree that started, and ended, in New Mexico. After making news hedlines, the two find their success a blessing, untill they are caught and locked up, only to later escape with a dumb witted news journlist.Although the film is taken from a story witten by Tarintino, many Tarintino fans will find it to be, lets just say, not up to par. Although the violence is very well portrayed, it lost quite a few points with its awfull music score.All in all, ""Natural Born Killers"" is no more than a one-time watch."
2,Glorifying Anarchy,"I didn't care for this movie. I realize that Oliver Stone was trying to make a point about society, but he painted a very pessimistic view where people seemed to revel in being rebellious. There are virtually no sympathetic characters in this movie. If you want to watch utter chaos and nonsense, tape South Park."
2,WHAAAT?,"Ok, so I was reading the on line reviews of this movie..""Great film?"", ""Best film?""... WHAAT?In my opinion nothing more than a pretencious attempt to make bad trashy pop culture.Oliver Stone was more interested on impressing the teens that were not supposed to see the film (but do, as they always do) than in telling a coherent history.This flick is eyecandy for violence starved minds, but that is not what bothers me (my mind has craved for its share of visual violence more than one time). What bothers me is that unlike Dobermann or Mad Max or any other nice little violence flick, Natural Born Killers tries to redeem itself as a socially concious movie....I would have given it only a star, but as I said, there are very nice looking scenes in the film...The Dinner scene... A cool looking killer and a blond chick making a bloddy mess... That was nice."
1,Truly disturbing,"Phew! This is one graphic and disturbing movie. I'm just thankful that I only paid two bucks for the rental and didn't waste more money on it. See it once, make sure it's your kind of movie before you even consider buying it. Natural Born Killers is definitely not in my taste. Take this with a grain of salt as I'm not a big Oliver Stone fan to begin with, and Tarantino is pretty much hit or miss with me."
1,"where the hell was the rest of ""Cheers""","Oliver Stone you melt my brain........after dropping 4 acids, taking two kilos of coke and a bottle of gin i throught it was just another co p"
1,WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK,"I saw this movie when it first came out,half way thru the movie people were walking out.I stayed ,figured it would get better...it didn't! After the movie,guy looked at me & said... Hey bud,is this the worst movie ever made ...or is it me!! I told him,no...it's not you! There was no rhyme or reason to the flick...it just kept getting more rediculous!Save your time & money!Jim"
2,"Shooting for Hip, Hitting Pointless","Oliver Stone proves to be just as reliable as a social critic as he is a ""historian.""PLATOON and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY were great films but JFK, though brilliantly made, was a sign that something was off about Stone's mental processes.NATURAL BORN KILLERS could have been a scathing indictment of our media's obsession with violence and decadence...but instead it's just Exhibit A in the indictment, wallowing in the filth it tries to satirize."
2,Maybe I Missed Something,"Mtv style camerawork, excessive unnessary violence(coming from a die hard horror fan and a Clockwork Orange lover), and choppy storytelling bog this one down. Oliver Stone has done great films such as Platoon and Born on the 4th of July. He has made good films like The Doors and U-Turn, and then he has done misfires where he doesn't seem to be able to keep his focus, and this movie is a prime example. What was intended as a scathing commentary about the media glamorizing violence in itself ends up two things, glorifying it itself and a self parody. It is really a shame the performances in this film are brilliant, Woody Harrelson is the stand out, but Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downy Jr. are really good as well. Perhaps if Stone hadn't just gone wild and spun the camera around, maybe he wouldn't have gotten so dizzy and lost direction."
1,mushroom-fueled mess,"it amazes me that people give this mushroom eater money to make crapola like this.I usually like Harrrelson, J. Lewis is (very often) terrific in everything she does--but here, man, both are UN-NATURAL, stiff--and not to be taken serious at all. Nothing that happens in this flick has a flicker of believability.I'd say this is another one for the trash--except I have way too much respect for the late, great Rodney Dangerfield to do that. Too bad his appearance is nothing more than a cameo here.Lastly, I liked Platoon just fine when I saw it many years ago; it was right on the mark, authentic...however, this effort here is one, big, bogus mess. It seems somebody's had too damn many mushrooms...or something."
1,Natural born losers,"For those who admire this anti-violence-with-violence movie,you can't keep your mind away from anger and aggression.You carry frustration with you all time.You're loser."
1,What's all the fuss about?,"I'm so glad I - or rather my Dad - got this DVD so cheap, otherwise I would have mighty disappointed. I wasn't particularly that fussed about watching it - I mentioned it, because one of the Tru Calling episodes was similar in a way. (I can't see HOW, my Dad pointed that out) And then my Dad ended up picking it up dirt cheap for me.I lasted 46 minutes, before finally giving up.I've seen worse films than this (Halloween, Last Broadcast, Lost Highway *cough*), and managed to last through them, but this film was bad. Worse than bad. Even worse than Lost Highway, and that's saying something! I lasted through that!!! I couldn't understand it, and it was severely disjointed, and made no sense to me whatever. I didn't like either Juliette or Woody Harrelson in this.I don't know what I was expecting from this, but certainly not what I got. Is it even worth wasting my words on? Well, here's my review ... !"
1,insanely stupid and it sucks completly,"oliver stone mad a mess of himself over this flick. didnt go for me because of its really bad performances by rodney dangerfield, tommy lee jones, tom sizemore and the ever so annoying robert downey jrs reporter guy. downey jr chewed up his scenes. Woody Harrelson was the only one to save this from being a total flop of a gay movie. Juliette Lewis' character is a chick I wouldnt want to have sex with even if the world was about to end and we were the last 2 people on earth. id rather make love to a chimpmunk. they should retitle this thing as The Natural Born sucks my ass"
2,I just wonder...,"Screen lore tells us, and there's reason to believe its true, Quentin Tarantino sold the script for NBK to finance his brilliant Reservoir Dogs.Makes me wonder what might have happened had Tarantino been able, somehow, to hold this one in reserve and make it himself.He's more subtle than Oliver Stone, in the same sense that a single drop of rain is more subtle than a tsunami. He's more inventive, and cannier by far, and he understands these characters better.Stone took what may have been a fine story, and turned it into an exhausting mess. I truly did not like it. I gave it two stars because of Harrelson and Dangerfield and Downey, worth the price of admission when the film was released, maybe worth a Netflix rental, but NOT going in my collection."
3,A tantalizing portrait society!,"The well known generated controversy around this very special movie aroused extreme commentaries around the world. Oliver Stone built a provocative and corrosive parody around a couple absolutely surrounded by a sick violence atmosphere.To my mind there were just two premises that visibly affected his final purposes; a marked excess of personal ambition and narcissist self tribute (after all who can deny his absolute domain around his discursive lexicon shown in JFK for instance), loading the screen of vertiginous visual innovations which resulted quite effective during the first ten minutes, but absolutely pernicious due the reiterative abuse of those sensationalist devices; on the other hand Stone also incurred into the orgiastic and bombastic flow he pretended to underline, being eventually dragged by this frenetic burden of violence which pitifully became a boomerang for him.All the unjustified excesses eventually, reflect a certain lack of discursive material."
3,11 years later,I never saw this when it origanally came out. But 11 years later the criticism of the media is still true (or even more true) The artistic views of Stone is well done (colorful and original) The violence is not so bad by today's standards. The shock value is gone and the film becomes a little tedious.
2,One of the most drastically overrated films of all time,"Hamfisted parade of bitter ugliness and pitiful stupidity that deals with two ecentric and rather annoying serial killers that go on a murdering rampage along the highways of texas...or something; with mass media cockroach (Downey Jr.) making them into celebrities. Starts off just fine, but the entire concept and style of the film becomes so repellent and boring that its supposed ""satirical"" meaning gets flushed right down the toilet, and all were left with is black intensity (which some people actually found fun). Yet, this was one of the most critically acclaimed films of 1994.The DVD is as good as anyone could hope. Nice picture and sound, informative doco, trailer which isn't actualy the theatrical trailer but the ""Director's Cut"" trailer and a selection of deleted scenes with an intro by Stone. So if you actually found yourself enjoying this film, you will most likely be satisfied."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"I thought maybe theis movie would be better than it looked. After all it was a Quentin Taratino script, was I wrong. I wished to this day (more than 15 years later) I had walked out on it."
2,Why doesn't this man retire?,"Oliver Stone is a man of little imagination and even less intelligence. Here's the message of ""Natural Born Killers"": Tabloid TV is bad. Mass murder is bad. Child abuse is bad. Cops are bad. Native Americans are good. Let's add some funky camera tricks to make this banality artful. Here is the message: See Dick run. Run, Dick, run. Run, run, run. Crap!"
2,"script by Quentin Tarantino, destroyed by Oliver Stone",This movie has its moments but they are rare. Oliver Stone could have left the script alone and the movie would have been better for it. Who knows what he's trying to say with this? The movie was not worth the time to try to find out. Do your self a favor and stroll over to the comedy section you'll be glad you skipped this one.
1,Idiotic,"The film that I heard so much about was from beginning to end, a waste of money and time. Graphically, mindless, stupid, and pointless violence makes up this film. NBK might be credited for the reason you dont see Woody Harrelson in any good movies any more. Actually none come to mind anyway. Oliver Stone is over rated, which is an understatement, because most actors and directors are these days. Oliver Stone, Tarrintino, and Araki and others come up with a series of violent sh-t and ""offensive"" images to show you, knowing that most viewers will be so ""outraged"" by it they'll forget the pointless plot. NBK was popular for its violence, there is nothing else in this movie. So if you dont enjoy graphic, bloody, mindless, violence, over and over and over, then dont see this."
1,UNBELIAVABLY BAD,"This so-called ""polemic"" director, who already gave us the masterpiece PLATOON, the entertaining ""ANY GIVEN SUNDAY"", the intriguing ""JFK"" and others, reached the lowest part of his career in this lousy picture, one of the worst thing I ever watched. Of course his ""good"" intentions were clear: criticize the American press love for news of violence, etc, etc. But the way he chose to do that was outrageous: half way through the movie, you can't watch it anymore, so bad it is, so bad taste, so ridiculous. This is no surprise, taking in consideration the fact that ""Blood lover"" QUentin Tarantino wrote this garbage... Watching this, you'll only be adding polution to your brains .."
5,One of the best Cult movies ever,"This is my favourite all time movie. Juliette Lewis and Woody Harrelson are both fantastic. If you like this one other movies to watch are;Clockwork Orange, Killing Zoe, True Romance."
2,"Visually beautiful, but utterly devoid of depth","I suppose the ""point"" of NBK (and Oliver Stone never makes a movie without trying to beat the audience over the head with a message) is that the title characters are at least honest about their bloodlust, while the media and society are more hypocritical-condemming it while secretely enjoying it. I say ""suppose"" because I'm not sure-this movie, though stunning to _watch_ (the different colors and film stocks are a treat for the eyes) has a huge gaping hole where a screeenplay should be. The key problem isn't that the title characters are so repellent-it's that every other character is equally repellent, and for the same reasons, which makes them all interchangeable. There is no real characterization (despite the efforts of a mostly superb cast) and so by the end, it really doesn't matter who lives or dies-which makes for a flat, uncompelling film. I give it 2 stars for the visuals and the acting-otherwise, it's forgettable."
2,Natural Born Killers,"Disappointing. Oliver stone ruined this movie. Classic Tarantino story line but without his direction and overall vision. Wasted genius when Ms Lewis' character recollects about her father and the viewers find themselves lost in a corny 1970's sitcom. The murder scenes lacked weight, after the scene you were left wanting more but you never got more, you got less and less. The murders were focused on the murderers, instead of the people being murdered. This took the emotion and the pain away from the victim and put the spotlight straight on Ms Lewis and Mr. Harrelson. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want to see a movie come miles short of its great potential."
4,great cinemetaghraphy but not a classic,"Oliver Stone directs Quentin Tarantino's tale about Mickey and Mallory going on a killing spree across the country. Woody Harrelson and Julliete Lewis give stunning performances. Robert Downey Jr. is great for his wacked out selfish role. Tommy Lee Jones(in his third Oliver Stone film) is in his craziest performance ever as the country Warden. They should give Rodney Dangerfield an oscar for his outstanding performance as Mallory's drunken dad. The angled cameras,B/W,Flinto green, and Lighting add lots to the film."
1,Mental Masturb******,"This film is clearly a directors attempt to take full creative license at the expense of the paying customer. I hope Stone has gotten this woe-begone attempt at artful representation out of his system... If a director wished to make an artistic comment, would choosing the so-called story of two gratuitous pathelogical murderers be the proper vehicle? This perhaps would've worked in the 60's, but lets get with the times Mr. Stone...and STOP wasting my time...chump!!"
1,Stone's worst movie,"Natural Born Killers is Oliver Stone's look at America's obesession with murderers. It follows Mickey and Mallory Knox, two spree killers who grew up in abusive households, as they ruthlessly murder people. It also looks at the media attention paid to them and the celebrity status they achieve.Stone was obviously trying to make a point in this movie, but it's lost in all the tasteless violence and poor dialogue. To make matters worse, he portrays Mickey and Mallory as an all-American couple you should root for while making a law abiding prison warden and news reporter villians. The most amazing thing about this movie is how many fans it has."
2,Weird -- but it didn't have to be.,"It was only after watching Natural Born Killers that I could fully appreciate why Quentin Tarantino (who wrote the story) and Oliver Stone (who directed the movie) fell out over it. It's obvious that the story has a lot of potential to be made interesting (I can think of comparing it to From Dusk Til Dawn, also written by QT) but sadly it failed to reach that potential this time. I blame it on the director.For some reason, Oliver Stone chose to give his version an ""arty"" feel (perhaps to give it his distinctive touch) and there are a number of places in the movie which seem ""strange"" to the point of spoiling my enjoyment. Another reason why I disliked this movie could be due to Woody Harrelson's acting. I've sworn never to watch another movie with him in it.Rent it if you must, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. It's not repeat watchable."
1,It Views Like a Deluxe Pizza Spinning Out of Control,"What a foul mess of a film and complete waste of the top-notch actors employed to tell this tiresome yet revolting tale. Cliche-ridden, obscene in the first, second, and third degree, replete with puerile cinematic chicanery, Natural Born Killers is a dazzling failure. Poor Oliver Stone. He created the cinematic equivalency of visiting a tatoo parlour after consuming great quantities of distilled spirits. In other words, a big mistake."
5,Review on NBK,"I believe this movie to be a great piece of film which was not a case of MTV style film noir. Those who said the graphics were baroque in some sort of way, are narrow minded and unable to see the beauty in Mr. Stones vision. One person said there wasn't enough commentary on the antimedia messages Stone was trying to express. Well, this wasn't watching a debate, this was a movie. In which cinematography and visual were used to entertain as well as depict the media power in America. Those who do not like this are completely ignorant to good film making, Oliver was a genius and a creative madman for making his art so seriocomically graphic and entertaining. Want to see real graphic, watch the news, this was fun to watch with a political message behind it."
5,One of those movies that really make you think...,"My brother presented this movie to me, and I immediately became entranced. It was purely in the point of view of the killers and really made a point. For those who didn't see the point and depth in this movie, you are exactly the superficial, surface people who would watch a movie like Clueless."
5,Possibly the coolest movie ever made!!!,"After trying for years, I eventually managed to get a copy of Natural Born Killers. Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis excellently portray a young psychopatic couple, Mickey and Mallory; who travel the States and murder 52 people in three weeks. These are turned into celebrities by the media, in particular Wayne Gayle (played by Robert Downey Jr).The acting, from an all star cast, is superb and the direction, by Oliver Stone, is excellent. This is one movie you just can't afford to miss."
4,Stone presents the theme the wrong way,"'Natural Born Killers' theme is, ideologically, a dead-on accurate theme. Unfortunately, Oliver Stone presents it in a rather odd way. He says that it is a statement that the media (cinema included, I assume) has taken violence too far. How does he go about illustrating this? By making a movie that is one of the most violent films in history. I believe his point would have had more impact if he told it from the view of the victims and their families. Then, the audience would be presented with people who have to watch as the killers of their loved ones are raised to star-status rather than following the killers and therefore empathizing with the wrong characters.BUT...Just because this movie gives a scrambled theme, doesn't make it bad. Technically, this movie is always a visual treat. It is exciting, funny, and the acting is wonderful. This movie succeeds in entertaining the audience, if they can stomach it."
1,(Un)Natural Born Killers (Unrated Nauseating Too Much Caffeine Director's Cut),"I got so dizzy ten minutes into watching this version, I had to shut it off. I have seen this movie twice in the theatre and many times on laser disc and DVD. It never looked like this. I traded in my much better DVD version for a $5.00 coupon at Best Buy. There is something wrong with this version and the shaking. I don't know how the error was made and don't trust it's a single issue. It has to be the way it was processed. This is the most messed up transfer I've seen to date. If Oliver Stone ever agreed to messing up his own film, he has well outdone what Steven Spielberg did with the 2002 version of E.T. Now after returning it for a refund I have no version of NBK, leaving my Oliver Stone collection incomplete. I wonder if they will ever correct this in later editions. At least they have it on Netflix and is the better original version!"
1,"Great movie, bad blu ray","This is my favorite movie of all time, and I own the directors cut in every format. Today when I popped in the blu ray, I noticed the picture shaking up and down. It start before the actual movie does, during the Warner and regency intro's. Within 5 minutes I could feel it making me motion sick and had to turn it off. Looked online and found I am not the only one who has received blu ray versions that does this."
5,Natural Born Killers - DVD,"I've always loved this movie and finally decided it was time to get my own copy. Very strange, and sometimes makes you feel like you're on an acid trip while watching it. There is quite a bit of violence, but nothing really gory. And the fact that it makes fun of how murderers become ""heroes"" is just great!"
1,THE WORST (I MEAN WORST) MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,"If you want to see a movie that shows some insight into human emotions and questions motives of different types of individuals, particularly those involved one way or another with illegal activities, I recommend ""The Concrete Jungle."" Oliver Stone missed the mark on this one and just satisfied his unhealthy fascination with violence. Sick movie, for people with sick minds!"
1,Worst Crime Against Humanity!,"This was the worst movie ever made. It was nothing but a graphic, deranged mess. I was tramitized for nine months after I saw this monstrasity. I'd rather be thrown into a pit of acid than to sit through it again. This movie was truly a crime against humanity."
1,Oliver Stone more like Oliver Stoned,"Stone extensively rewrote an original script by Quentin Tarantino .Both Oliver Stone and Quentin Tarantino should have been shot for this Mish Mash of a Pathetic Movie ,Stone for making it like he did and Tarantino for not making it like He Should.Flash Backs,Flash Ups,Flash Dreams make for the Viewer thinking ""With these Actors like this it Gotta get Better than this"" Unfortuantly it does not.This is the Movie that caused such Contrevesy when it came out ,I thought it was for its content but alas it was for the way it was Directed .If you want a Movie by Tarantino ,Buy one that he Directed.What a waste of $25"
1,do not spend no even one dolar,you will not stand it you will turn the televition off before the movie finish
3,"""Abandon hope all ye who enter here!""","Judy Lynn, in her review in 2000, told the real incisive essence of this film. Despite the finest performances of both Woody Harrelson and Robert Downey, that I have ever seen, and, in fact, really fine performances by all, this blood and gore and violence, is just - to me, at least - way too much. Therefore the 3 stars. Yes it is a well done performance, but, to me, this movie is the equivalent to walking around with your insides visible to the world, if you're dying of a horrible metastasized cancer. It doesn't accomplish anything but repulse."
2,"A so-so black comedy,Not for all tastes.2 and a half stars","This dark satire about two killers Mickey and Mallory Knox that kill people and end up in prison where a TV reporter turns them into the media's fascination,Despite some good directing by Oliver Stone and a good plot,NBK turns into a weird,different black comedy/satire that leads the viewer into weird scenes were the scenes turn black and white and have pictures in the background.A weird,wild satire that's not for all tastes.The dirctor's cut makes a lot more sense than the R version.Really odd cast features Woody Harrelson,Juliette Lewis,Robert Downey,Jr.(in a embarassing role),Tommy Lee Jones(In a wasted role as a warden),and Tom Sizemore(In a odd role as a cynical killer cop)."
4,Beautiful Music!,We bought this for our baby girl (1 year) to play with. We didn't want a Chinese plastic one that contains who knows what since it will be in her mouth. This is made in Germany but a great company: Hohner. It plays well but I think its life span will be less than a plastic one since it gets moisture in it and is a little more difficult to get truly dry. I found some for half the price at a local store that was wooden but again made in china. Better safe than sorry!
2,Why buy wwood?,This Honor looks nice but sounds almost exactly like my cheaper plastic soprano. I guess you have to spend a whole lot more to get a wooden one that beats the good plastic ones.
2,Shipped wrong!,"I had my hopes really high for this recorder, and when I finally thought it came, it turns out they shipped it wrong so I got the cheaper pearwood one instead. I was extremely disappointed."
2,Doesn't Match the Rest of the Set,"I own the blue Pistoulet set and honestly, I'm not impressed with the pasta bowl. It just doesn't match the colors or feel of the other pieces be it the dinnerware or other serving-ware (tureen, salad bowls, etc). I wouldn't have registered for it and wish that I had returned it."
2,Pasta Bowl,I was a bit disappointed with this as I thought it was a serving dish when it turned out to be an individual pasta bowl. At the price of over 11 dollars per dish I will not be buying it to complete my set of 8. I believe I can still use it as a serving dish for something besides pasta.
1,This is a bootlegged version!,"Not only is this a bootlegged version with the colors washed out and contrast horrible, it is a really low quality VCD rip which wasn't even upscaled properly and the display resolution of the video feed is tiny!"
1,Oneida Couplet flatware has serious problems,"In July, 2010 I purchased 12 5-piece place settings of Oneida Couplet flatware. Within one month, I noticed the handles of a few knives beginning to separate from the blades. I returned them to Macy's for new knives which took six months to receive. Also during this time, I had the same thing happen to four other knives. In addition, I had to return them (paying the shipping myself) to Macy's Returns in Sacramento. As of this date, I am still waiting for one of the sets to be returned that was shipped in January. Finally, having lost all patience today, I returned the entire set to Macy's for a full refund. I was told by a clerk that this is a common problem with Oneida Couplet flatware."
4,Pretty realistic-feeling doll,"My 20 month old daughter received this for Christmas this year. It is her very first doll, and so far she loves it. The body is air-filled, which you control the amount of air for firmness of the body. The limbs are pliable and they feel real, but the head and face is your typical hard synthetic material. This doll has a pleasant lavender scent to it. Don't know how long it will stay scented, we'll see. The mouth on this particular doll is open, so you can purchase a baby bottle and pretend to ""feed"" the baby. If you are worried about losing any warranty papers for this doll, fret not, because the warranty and the company's information and phone number is sewn onto the doll like a label. Now why can't all manufactorers of toys and dolls do the same, don't you think?"

1,Maybe a good product?? If it would run....,"No support from Snap, so I can not tell you if its a good product. I have issues running it and have been trying to get support from them for a couple of weeks now. They have no phone number to call and their tech support does not respond to emails faster than 5 days or so."
1,"Works as advertised, for a little while","This will turn your PC into A PVR. And it does, when it works. I would say it is better than Tivo some of the time. It is cheaper, has more features than Tivo. Only problem with me was it would crash the whole system if trying to watch live or recorded tv, although it recorded fine. Maybe this was a problem with my hardware, but whos to say? The problem is, they have email only tech support. So after waiting 3 business days, you will get a generic response, asking you to try something that you already tried 2 days ago. I have 11 computer certifications, so the problem wasn't anything simple. SO I am breaking down and getting a Tivo, which I should have done in the first place."
2,Used to work ok before the recent upgrade,"Used to work ok. In retrospect, it's never been worth what they charge for it, but it was ok. It took a long time to load, sometimes would hang up, etc. - I have more than adequate RAM, processing speed, etc. The recent upgrade to 4.81 is however a nightmare. It has kicked off some of the local channels and is causing my whole computer to lock up and has gotten even slower in loading and processing. Until they fix the current release, I would strongly advise against purchase."
1,No AUDIO,"I would give this product five stars, because of the terrific features and interface ... but I can confirm the bug others have reported here, in that it sometimes, randomly, just doesn't record any audio. And I wouldn't score down a review for a mere bug but for the fact that a) it's a show-stopper, and b) the bug has existed for YEARS now and has still gone unfixed ... apparently unacknowledged, even!I was unfortunate enough to discover this _after_ I bought the full copy, but at least I got a very nice firefly remote out of it that I can put to use in an alternative like MCE or SageTV."
2,Buggy Product with Somewhat slow support,"When it works, it rivals my Replay and Tivo experience. However, that said, it is ""buggy"". You cannot depend on it functioning as expected. THAT WAS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW! AFTER GOING ROUND & ROUND FOR NEARLY A MONTH, THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED BY SNAPSTREAM. AM I A HAPPY CAMPER? YES! I still resent that you cannot talk to any support person -- it is all done via email back and forth. You cannot even get the phone answered at their Houston TX office. FIVE STARS WOULD BE MY CURRENT RATING!!! It just took awhile and lots of irritation to get there."
1,Way too much hassle,"My expectation was to install the recommended hardware, hook up the cable, watch live tv, record shows and play them back. After the installation there was a problem at every step. First figure out your cable characteristics, then discover that your cable source encodes the channels that you want the most and that they are not available thru a third party tuner.Next, after you scan for the available channels you must tediously map them to the Snapstream lineup. Live tv seemed to work okay.Tried to use the scheduling guide to see what's on and watch a show. Error. Tried to go back to Live-TV. Error. Tried to play back something that was miraculously recorded. Error.The forums are full of users with unresolved problems. In this day and age, programs must be more robust and stable than this. I would have expected this in the 70's. I have no interest in dedicating significant time trying to figure out why this doesn't work. I'll just get DVR from my cable co."
5,Best Software DVR,"I've been looking for a DVR software supports QAM. This one works great. It did take some time at the beginning to manually identify the QAM channels one by one, but that's not the fault of the software. After setting it up, it requires little effort to schedule recording.The best things of this software is that it provides tons of flexibility in terms of settings. Other nice features are web configuration interface, integration with iTunes and watch your recorded program on iPod. Also it's integrated with a streaming server, this makes it possible to watch recorded program on a web browser anywhere.Over all, this beats Windows Media Center hands down."
3,They Work,"I bought these to replace one broken string on my viola, but they severely lack the tonal quality my previous set has.They work and don't sound awful, but they're not going to transform your instrument, unless maybe you have red label strings that are a couple years old?"
3,be careful if just using as a fax/copier,"I have owned this for 4 months and have been pleased thus far, until today. I only use it as a fax and copier. I have a seperate printer at my office so it is not even hoked up to my computer. Today I received the warning that my color cartridges are out of ink, so it totally shuts down. I cannot even send a fax. The problem is that I have never used color. I always copy in black and white, same with the fax. Apparently it cleans itself periodically like a cat and that uses a small amount of ink. It is rated for 400 pages of color, so 100 pages of ink a month just for cleaning seems excessive to me. It is frustrating to spend c.$40 for color even though I never plan on using it. Perhaps those were the sample cartridges that came with it and they did not have the same capacity as standard ones. Other than that, as a fax machine and flatbed copier, it works great. Good value and small size."
1,just got rid of mine.,"used to beep at me. eat papers while i was trying to fax them. suck ink. once, i couldn't print because a cartridge was empty. seriously had to run across the street to the home depot to replace the cartridge. all the other cartridges were full.only irony about getting rid of it is that the inks are still full. $50 worth of ink sitting in the machine now that i have no desire to ever use again.oh, another irony for vista users. the drivers on this thing loaded and worked well. brother wants to get you up and running so you can inky, dinky do$$$$$$$$$$$."
1,"worst all-in-one, ever.","The title is a joke, but not far from the truth. I have had multiple problems with the unit:operations:1) ink evaporates quickly, even though I never print anything2) sheet feeder for scanning does not feed smoothly, lots of paper jams3) the brother scanning software (on mac os x) doesn't work when multitasking, and requires a reinstall (this happens a lot)design:4) scanning function doesn't work if there is an 'out of ink' error5) usb and network connections don't work simultaneouslysupport:6) brother tech support has not been very knowledgeable nor helpfulI've ended up buying cheap ink cartridges ($3/ea) and never using it as a printer...but only until I get a better all-in-one."
1,"DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT, IT IS TERRIBLE, BROTHER IS TERRIBLE","We are so unhappy with this machine, we are having the same problems that most report, we have to refill all the catridges at once, and they run out so fast that you are buying them constantly. Even if you use it for black and white faxes only it draws on all the color inks as well to print it. Ours is not hooked up to our PC it is used for black and white copies and black and white faxes. Brother customer service was horrible, they say there is nothing they can do, I asked several times if I was the only customer upset by this and at first they would not answer. After speaking to 3 supervisors, no one would offer anything. They finally said that they recieve many calls about this. They referred me to headquarters and the number they gave 908-704-1700 only rings and rings.I am reporting them to BBB as well."
2,It will not let you print with 20% ink in cartridge!!,It is a poor reflection in Brother to sell a product that will stop working with 20% of the ink in the cartridge. Of course they make there money in ink but this is cheating. There website is give a pathetic explanation as to why they need to do shut down the printer with low ink. Also rather flimsy construction.
1,Good first Impression and then..,"I loved this MFC out of the box. Easy install and a great machine to setup and get started much better than similar ones from HP, which needed some assembly etc. It had loads of features and I wondered why more people were not buying these. Then one ink cartridge ran out and i could not print a thing even when i was just doing back and white and had enough black ink. My 7 year old HP inkjet still had that feature. The ink finishes pretty fast too and i cannot get it at circuit city either. PC fax is somewhat non-intuitive to setup. Brother should fix these or take the product off the market.."
2,Don't bother!,"Since I have my own bussiness, I'm really-really need fax copy scanner printer machine. The beauty and function this machine look promises.But every year, it always stuck, broke, stopped. Brother's always send me new one because I bought warranty BUT....is wasting your time, wasting your jobs because the waitting for the product. Is terrible.....Only works ounce a year.So...my advise, don't bother buy it, if you do don't forget buy warranty, it's worth it."
2,Just barely adequate. Uses ink like crazy.,"When it works, it is ok, but it's not a ""set it and forget it"" device.My biggest gripe is that it uses a lot of ink in a periodic self-cleaning cycle that apparently can't be turned off. I very rarely print anything anymore, but even so, I need to buy ink every couple of months as it wastes it all on self-cleaning cycles. If any of the cartridges are empty or missing, it won't let you do ANYTHING - including scan or outgoing fax - until the cartridge is replaced. I can't imagine what they were thinking with that design.In conclusion, I'd sum up my experience with this unit in two words: never again."
1,Brother MFC-420CN Plugged ink is the norm,"I am not through the original set of ink which comes with the printer and it is already plugged. First yellow, then the other two colors and now black.Looking at the various help sites on the web only reassures me that this is not a reliable printer and Brother replacements seem to continue the problem. I don't need the repeated shipping costs and time wasted. HP here I come.Don S"
3,Brother MFC 420cn not bad for price,"I have had this printer for a few years now and still runnin strong. Its not the best printer in the world but for the price and multifuntion, works well with me and i get all my ink online for Fractions of the cost of the brother ink so ink cost to me isnt an issue. I have noticed it prints things about 2 shades darker then what i see on photoshop even after gamma but i have learned to just make it brighter on the screen and good to go."
3,Hate the paper tray,"good machine, the paper tray is not easily accessible for me and you cannot view the amount of paper in it."
4,This is a great multifunction printer,"This is a great printer. It is fast and reliable. I have had it for a year and have not had any problems. The ink cartridges are simple to access and easy to change. The document feeder works great. The flat bed scanner is the best. The software is very good too, with the exception of not having label or business card capabilities- that is why I rated it only 4 stars. But overall, it is a great printer."
3,endless cleaning cycle,"mostly i liked this printer until i tried to print some pictures 4 up and 9 up and ended up in an endless cleaning cycle, i suppose designed to use up the cartridges so i'd have to buy more ink..."
1,Brother printer 420CN,"Product was slow in arriving. When it did arrive, it had no documentation,invoice or any information about contacting the shipper.Shortly after stsarting to use it, it gave a message ""Paper Jam, open back cover and clear"".There had been no printing.Have not been able to clear the message, or use the printer.Have written a letter to the address shown on the shipping label. Have not heard anything.John StevensPurchased at Amazon"
5,Great Multifunction,"Its a great Network Printer. The only issue Ive had is the INK. It tears through INK like crazy. If it sits while turned on, every day it will go through and clean the ink cartridge. Wasteing more ink. Had to start leaving it unplugged just so it would stop cleaning the ink every night. Also it will STOP Printing at about 20% ink left. It will tell you it needs to be replaced. Found a trick to get around that by taking a black sharpy marker and blacking out the ink levels on the cartridge. Now it thinks its always 100% full and uses it till its gone."
2,You Get What You Pay For?,"Revised 2/12I needed an inexpensive multifunction machine and this product fit the bill. I purchased it in September and I'm on my third black ink cartridge! Although the ink cartridges are separate, the printer will not work if one of them is empty. I've used it to print, copy and fax b/w and color. It worked fine for all of those except copying from off-white paper. No matter how I adjusted the resolution, the background was too dark for the black text.I started with four stars and now I'm down to two."
1,Defective Out of the Box,"Obviously a lot of people love this printer when it works, but there appear to be significant quality issues at Brother.I decided to take a chance and order one, but am now sorry I did. I followed the instructions for setup and during the ink cartridge initialization the printer stopped working and gave me an error message, stating that it could not complete initialization. After following the troubleshooting instructions in both the manual and online multiple times, nothing solved the problem. (Scarily, the primary explanation in the troubleshooting manual for this error message is simply that ""there is a mechanical malfunction"" with the machine.) This one's going back and I don't think I'll take my chances with Brother again.Thank goodness Amazon makes returning defective product so easy."
2,Great... When it worked,"When I first got the printer it worked absolutely fine, except for eating up ink a little too quickly. Then after about a year I was plagued with constant paper jams which took a lot of time and effort to correct. Now magenta won't print, probably due to an ink clog, and nothing I do will fix it. Everything I print in color looks horrendous. I would advise you not to buy this printer if you're looking for reliability."
2,"Looks good on paper, but not in person","The biggest problem with this device is its paper tray. It has the flimsiest and most awkward tray I have ever seen, worse then what I had on my $29 Lexmark Z13! On top of that, it barely holds 100 pages. If it wasn't for this Ii would probably give it 4 stars.The flatbed scanner and paper feeder are also flimsy, but on par for a unit in this price range.The network interface works pretty well; you can basically use all its features from a networked computer you could with USB (even send faxes). The only network limitation I have found is that the memory card reader seems to be read-only via the built-in FTP server (I haven't really looked to see if there is a password or something to unlock)."
2,"Some good, some bad, most bad.","This was a gift from my wife, my old HP was old! and having trouble feeding paper and faxes. This Brother feeds multipage faxes great. Now the bad news, it will completely stop everything if any color is empty, no chance of going black only or gray scale, it stops. When it says a color is empty there is still a noticeable amount of ink still in there. I'm used to HP's that leave just a trace on the sides of the container. Nowhere on a Brother cartridge does it list the volume of ink contained within. So you have no idea how much you are buying. Paper tray seems very cheap and flimsy, it has no pusher to push the paper forward. It does miss-feed envelopes fairly often. I'll just say this will most likely be my first and last Brother printer."
2,"clunky interface, memory hog, constantly replacing ink","this was purchased to be used as a secondary printer in a small office. purchased because of price, built-in networking & color feature. it has been at work for over a year & i'm not at all happy with it.unable to network using ""built-in"" interface. doesn't matter because i can't seem to find a universal driver that will work in place of the ""printer manager"" interface which saps memory resources. purchased because the ink seemed inexpensive, but it seems as though i'm constantly replacing cartridges despite sporadic use (<500 pgs./mo.).it prints nice & has a small footprint, but if i had to do it over again, i would have gone with another hp workhorse."
2,My second Brother printer failed,"I have had a MFC-5840CN and now a MFC-420CN and both have had clogged Magenta ink jets. There is nothing to be done. Both printers clogged during dry winter months. Prints were perfect a few days before clogging started. Test prints showed progression of clogging for both printers was identical. I'd guess maintaining a high humidity environment is important.Ignoring the magenta ink problem,,,, bother printers work well. The scanner and paper feeder are very useful.Funny thing. Installing the driver for the MFC5840-CN from CD worked well enough if you installed twice. The driver downloaded from the web site never installed at all and the Brother Technical support knew about the issue.... all tech support had to do to improve the situation was put a copy of the driver shipped on the CD on to the web site. Why tech support never did that is a mystery."
1,Worst ever due to stupid ink management,"I recommend NOT to buy this unit.The reason for this is, that as soon as one ink cartridge is low (not even empty), the unit stops working. On their website Brother mentions that it was designed that way to ensure quality printouts and protect the heads. In my opinion the only reason is to force you to buy the expensive cartridges.Even if you only print black & white, you still need the other 3 cartridges. The problem is, that the automatic cleaning process drains the ink. This means even if you NEVER print a single color page, you constantly have to replace the color cartridges."
1,Bad quality heads,"A few months after I bought this, the black print head stopped working. Found out that it's a common problem. A friend has the same model with voicemail feature and one of the color heads went out too. I will never buy another Brother again."
1,Awfull experience,"I bought this unit because I had an other ""Brother"" before. What a mistake.I had it for over a year, very light use (a few copies, a few faxes). The machine uses a lot of ink. It performs self-cleaning every day. You run out of ink in a few months even if you are not using it. With no ink you cannot send or receive faxes (even you are out of yellow and the fax report is printed black). Now I cannot send faxes at all, I am getting some ""com"" error. Its memory is full all the time (99%) and sometimes prevents you sending faxes.Do not waste your money, go other place."
1,Just doesn't work,"I even sent mine for repair and received a replacement. If you use the document feeder with copy, fax, or scan option, images are distorted. Most of the time, it prints smudges on envelopes. Sometimes, it just doesn't print the entire document. Often will not print on label sheets"
5,BROTHER HAS GREAT CUSTOMER SERIVCE WTHIN THE USA,"This printer/fax/copier/scanner is amazingly compact for all that it does. It fits nicely on my desk and is aesthetically pleasing. It was a breeze to set up and I am technologically illiterate.The printer is quick and the quality is good. The copier and scanner likewise work well. It might eat ink quickly, but if it does, I will start using the PC fax option.I had a problem with the ""distinctive ring"" feature and I had to call customer service. I received excellent service from a person within the United States. I was glad to speak with someone who understood me and someone whom I could understand. I know that people in other countries need jobs too. But, when you have a service issue that requires communication and understanding, it is great to speak with someone from your own country.I will stay with Bother products, even when I upgrade."
1,Piece of Crap,"Worst ever printer.Lousy print qualitySucks up ink like a sponge.Poor customer support (they told me they couldn't help because I wasn't using ""original Brother ink"")Awful performance.Had problems with this trashy printer right from the start.Cheaply made.A real piece of crap.If I could give this a less than one star rating I would. Expect problems if you buy this machine.Also -- beware of good reviews about this heap of junk because their support staff told me they have people who write good reviews of their products.If you want to throw away your money -- this is the printer for you. Otherwise, buy a HP -- or some other name -- rather than this piece of crap."
3,Decent deal for the price,"I got this printer after being very happy with my brother HL-2070N (networked laser). The MFC-420CN unit works ok, but there are a few annoyances: unlike the laser it doesn't have a web server that lets you easily change the IP (in fact, you need the windows utility to do that). My router's DHCP server assigned my printer a different IP next time I turned it on and brother's scanning utility on my Mac just crashed. After one month of light use, the printing head was already clogged once (easily fixed by forcing a cleanup) and the scanner doesn't scan all the way from the left side of the glass plate, which makes aligning a paper to be scanned somewhat of a hit and miss. You should also be aware that the printer comes with no USB and network cable, but you might have already guessed that from looking at the price. Bottom line: decent printer for light use. If you want a solid performer for your office, I'd stay away from it."
5,Great Shoe!,"Very comfortable shoe right out of the box. Really like the material the sole is made out of, very shock absorbant."
2,"Better than nothing, kind of","I got frustrated using this manual to do basic maintenance as well as major work. For example, just doing a 2500 mile service requires flipping back & forth between the instructions and the tables of torque specs, fluid capacities, etc. Annoying as heck. Some of the pictures are useful, others are completely useless.What really got me was that in many cases, the procedures listed are just plain completely WRONG. Example: Removing the tank canopy with fuel filter, etc. on a 2003 Touring model. Clymer says to pull the assembly straight out of the tank. Completely wrong!! Only after I bought the Harley service manual did I find out there is a spring-loaded hinge, and you CAN'T get the canopy assembly out unless you know how to do it.The Harley manual is WELL worth the extra $20-30. My Clymer manual went out with last week's recycle, and I won't buy another one."
3,Works??????,"Like so many others, I've had a problem with the adjustments on this light. I've tried everything and followed the directions to a ""T"", including the troubleshooting suggestions. My light stays on and does NOT shut off. But, I'm going to keep it and use it as a porch light as we don't have one where we positioned this item. Edited to add: I'll simply plug it in when I need it and unplug it when I'm done."
5,Worth every penny.,"Was easy to install and set up, and it works great too. The range was just what we needed. It comes on when we need it but is not always turning on for no reason."
3,Adjustments knobs hard to change,"The product seemed to be good quality. The problem I had with it was the adjustments to alter the ""how long to stay on when motion is detected button"". The controls are recessed and you can't get your finger in there to adjust them. They are not slotted for a screw driver or any other tool. I thought maybe an eraser on a pencil may do the trick. It didn't. For this reason alone, I would not recommend this product. Too hard to adjust and instructions seem to be a bit incomplete."
3,Really glad I made this purchase!,"As other reviews have noted, the adjustment dials are very tiny and I was unsure which end of the adjustment ""arrow"" was the pointer.However, the installation was easy.With the days growing shorter, it's wonderful to have a light flip on when we pull into the drive. And even more wonderful for this lady of the house to have light while unpacking a trunk full of grocery bags.So far I'm REALLY glad I bought this light.(Next: the test of New England winter snow, sleet, and freezing temps!)The only reason I didn't give this light 5 stars was the confusing adjustment ""arrows"", and not being sure about its survival through the winter.** UPDATED MAY 2012: **It made it through the winter!** UPDATED NOVEMBER 2012: **The motion sensor stopped working. I've downgraded to 3 stars because it was wonderful while it functioned. I'm resuming my hunt for a driveway light.... sigh. I hope others out there have better results - if anyone has any suggestions, I'd be thrilled...."
3,50/50,"Bought two of these for my outside deck. After figuring out one was continually on due to it sensing a nearby street, I just masked the appropriate vision area of the sensor with some gorilla tape and it works great. Unfortunately, the second one the first day it was exposed to moisture tripped the GFI it was plugged into and continued to do so. It has no apparent cracks in it's casing. But since it seems I get to return it for free I am going to take a chance on a replacement ..... PS, I really don't get the reviews complaining about how difficult it is to adjust. It seems to me no different than any other motion sensing light I have bought and installed and only took me a few minutes once I realized it's field of vision may be be a little wider than some."
4,Easy Set Up,I needed a motion light for a garage to assist sight for entry. This light was perfect for the job and did not require specialized electrical work. I was able to light a back area of yard also. Set up is very easy and requires very little mechanical work.
2,Lasted a little over a year,This was installed inside a garage as supplemental lighting. Worked ok for about a year.The light still works but the motion detector does not work now.
1,motion light,Had it installed last week. It looks very nice but does not work. The instructions are poorly worded and no matter what you do to get the light to work. it does nothing. I guess I will just throw it away and look for a light that really works.
1,Do not waste your money!,"My handyman installed this on the outside of my house and I paid him to do so. My son had to completely re-install it when it did not work. This only works when I stand in front of it, jump up and wave my arms...and even then, I am lucky to be recognized as a moving object. It has to be unplugged and reset every time there is a blink in power and then it is undependable. You be the judge."
2,Motion Floodlight,These are very limited for providing the motion detector to activate. Made cheaply---spend more money and have a motion detector installed in the area you need the security to provide consistent coverage for that area of your house. I finally took one off my house when it failed to work 99% of the time.
4,"Like It, But Don't Love It!","I was really glad to finally find one that would ""plug in"" since I'm not an electrician and it is definitely bright enough. My bulbs were broken in shipping and though I was given a $10 credit, it took me a week to find what I needed and paid $13 for them. I've never gotten the motion sensor to work correctly, so I just hooked it up with a ""handi-switch"" so I can turn it on from inside the house whenever I want/need to. It's very helpful, but not exactly what I had in mind."
5,Perfect solution,This light was the perfect solution to the problem I was trying to solve concerning a plug-in motion sensor light for the backyard area where the dog goes. I had the outlet nearby so we installed this on a fence post and it is perfect. I thought it was very easy to set because the instructions were very clear to me. I read them thoroughly before attempting to set it.
5,"Great Product, @ a great Price!","This is a great product that has worked flawlessly. The cord is a good length which allows flexibility, and the light is plenty bright. The motion works very good as well. It does have a lot of plastics parts, so I don't expect this to last in the outdoor elements for 10 years. I do believe for the money you are getting a great product. Would highly recommend!"
2,"Should Be ""Excel 2000 User's Handbook""","When you use ""Developer"" you expect to find out something about the program that is not contained in other books. This was not the case here. The book spends a good three-hundred pages going through Excel conventions that could be considered ""groundwork"" for development but also ""User's"" material. The book never really get's beyond the ""groundwork"", however. I learned nothing that I couldn't have figured out with MSDN and some ""hacking around.""Get Using Excel Visual Basic For Application by Jeff Webb for great introduction to Excel Development."
2,Useful but no developers handbook...,"Deliriously happy with my Access2000 Developer's Handbook set I bought this book without looking any further convinced the DevH series are the best... and they are... just not for Excel. Calling this a developers handbook insults any serious developer. Don't get me wrong, this IS a good book on Excel, it just worthless if you want to get some real coding going on there."
1,Wow! This Book UnderWhelmed Me!,"I can't believe that someone is obviously trying to plant reviews on this book. Looking at the two recent reviews from LA and WA I'm convinced they were on crack when they wrote them (or at least exclamation point happy--as both reviews make liberal usage of).Also, an obvious attempt was made to casually point out the books strong points-which there are none. The help file information is relatively weak in its depth (like the rest of the book) and the Web publishing stuff has to be a laugh. How much further can ""Sava As..."" Web Page, be taken?Don't be fooled by the corny five star reviews, this book is nothing short of worthless."
5,Simply the Best,This is the book I've been waiting for. I develop small applications for a variety of clients to streamline their operations. Some of them have quite a high turnover of staff so it is very important that new staff have access to some help when they run my applications. This book showed me how to control the office assistant so that helpful text is given at the time the user needs it. I haven't seen this in other Excel VBA books. I also know how to build a full-blown help facility for larger projects - also missing from other books. I also found it helpful for Web based projects as it shows how to spruce up excel spreadsheet for web publication - and how to publish them too! As you can tell I'm really excited about this book. It has been worth it's weight in gold as I've used quite a lot of the material from the CD with moderate adjustments - and it all works too!
2,Mobile never worked,"I think the idea of this bassinet is better than the actual product. My major problem was that the mobile never worked. The bears would spin for about 30 seconds and the music never worked. I contacted the company and after a few tries I did get a very helpful person who replaced the mobile and parts. I had to take the bassinet apart, not fun, and reinstall everything only to have those parts also not work. By now our daughter was two months old and we never got to use the features that were going to help sooth and amuse her.The bassinet does look nice, but one other not great feature is the pad is very thin. I would have to say if you get one that works I am sure its great but the fact that I got two that didn't work I can't say it is made very well!"
3,Electronics don't work!,"I bought this bassinet for our baby who has not arrived, so we haven't used it yet. The first one had a short so the music would work but it sounded funny and would phase in and out. The remote did not work at all. I called and customer service was very helpful and sent me out a replacement for all the electronic parts. I changed them out and the music works fine now, but neither of the remotes has ever worked. I guess I'll have to call them again. I find it discouraging that neither one has worked and so many others are having trouble. I know I am using it correctly and that I put the batteries in correctly; it still does not work. The bassinet is great, but we paid extra for the electronic features and it bothers me that they do not work."
1,Not Worth it,"I baught this bassinett because my mother insisted that the crib was too big for a newborn and they need a cozy place to sleep. (not really true) My son did not like it at all. First problem as someone said was the pad was very flimsy and there is no mattresse in the market that fits into this size bassinett. Second my sons arms kept hitting the sides of the bed because he did not like to be swaddled, i believe this would be a problem for all bassinets. It says up to 6 months on this product but i dont think a big baby would fit after three months. I returned this product and just moved the crib in my room."
4,Frustrating but nice..,"I like this bassinet.. I really do.. I only wish I knew if I can ever get the vibration/music/mobile to work! Simplicity is really nice on the phone and they sent out a piece for it but that didnt work, so I called again today and they said they will send out a different piece this time.. HOPEFULLY it will get it to work.. It took me about 3hrs to put together, only to find out that the things I bought it for don't work.. and yes, I put the batteries in!!! Frustrating and I will see if I can type up a better review on the mobile piece whenever I get the other part in the mail (5-7 days) and hopefully the baby won't be here before then!"
4,Can't find sheets to fit,"I like the bassinet BUT I can't find sheets to fit like the one that is on it when you purchase the bassinet. Babies r us was the first placed I checked, with no luck.So if any one knows where to find sheets that fit the bassinet like the orginal one Please let me knowMrs Claire Vasilee-mail normagirl2@yahoo.com"
5,Everything you could want....,"I bought the bassinet for my stepdaughter, so I haven't actually tried it out, but she demonstrated all the features to me and I thought it was great!I was impressed with the pattern/material that it was made with, it was very elegant looking, but neutral enough to be used for a boy or girl.As my step-grandchild was just born last week and we don't live in the same town, I haven't visited the baby at home yet, only the hospital, so that's all I can say about it."
4,"""Three hundred gold-torqued warriors attacked...""","The most insightful thing about this volume is the author's comparison of both the Anglo-Saxon and their British opponents' views on the comitatus - the war band of heroic Dark Age Britain. Usually, authors prefer to focus on the differences between these two ethnic groups rather than their similarities. Most of the evidence in the book comes from the heroic poetry from Beowulf for the Anglo-Saxons and the Godiddin for the British. Individual chapters focus on social structure, military organization, poets, the hall, and more. A good little book and a quick read."
5,Great book,This book really helped me understand my own son better and find new ways of dealing with his own frustration. I am glad his therapist recommended this book. It has helped our family tremendously!
5,Great Resource for an Educator!,This book is a great resource for an educator or a parent to assist in helping students that have Sensory Processing Disorders to find the appropriate accommodations needed so that they can flourish and succeed and make progress in the general education environment.
4,At last!!!!,"I was told about this book by a doctor and finally I feel better knowing there is a name for what our child was experiencing. We thought it was odd he never cuddled and did not like to walk on certain textures, etc. As i read this book, I could picture exactly how our child would react to situations and it all clicked. Now he is getting a therapist trained in sensory development."
3,Good explanation but little help with what to actually do.,"This book was very good with the explanation. It was sometimes hard to follow even with a science BS degree. Although it did a good job of explaining the potential areas of the disorder, it did little to actually help you learn to teach your child to deal with the disorder. If that is what you are looking for, then the sequel to this book is a much better investment."
3,Indepth Info w/o Ideas on How to Help,"I gave this book three stars because it has a lot of in depth information on Sensory Processing Disorder, but it doesn't tell the reader much on how to help the child. Also, the book is very long it seems like the writer could have conveyed the same information more concisely. I also purchased Raising a Sensory Smart Child. This book explains SPD nicely but also provides tons of ideas on how to help your child. Unless you want to know as much as possible about SPD, I would recommend skipping this book and going straight to Raising a Sensory Smart Child.Raising a Sensory Smart Child: The Definitive Handbook for Helping Your Child with Sensory Processing Issues"
3,Lacking,"Although the content of this book is great, it's claim to simplify the concepts of sensory dysfunction are a bit off. Terms are used without any introduction or explination. It is a good book to inform the public on this subject BUT the only book to do so at this point in time. Perhaps the next book or next edition will break it down even more for those who haven't spent years in school reviewing the subject matter."
2,Too Technical,"This book was some what helpful if you have no idea what Sensory is. However, I found it to technical and little information on an action plan or helpful hints!"
4,deep,Only half way thru the book. Very detailed about different problems. I see different items that relate to my relative. It takes some digesting. I look forward to the solutions to the problems.
5,Bible For SPD Parents,"This is an excellent resource for confused and desperate parents and child educators who have children with Sensory Processing Disorder (Sensory Integration Disorder). It's an easy read and in language for the everyday person, so you don't have to be a specialist to understand it. It encourages empathy and compassion and offers a new way to have a dialogue with these children who often can't speak for themselves due to Autism Spectrum Disorder and other Neurological Disorders. My copy will be tattered before too long, I'm sure."
4,A must Have,"I felt so relieved after reading this book. People do not understand what it's like to have a child with sensory issues. These kids are NOT brats, spoiled, getting their own way.. This is a DISORDER and the public needs to be educated to such. I 100% recommend this book to anyone with or without a child with sensory issues. I would have given it 5 stars, I just wish the book had MORE information on dealing with the crisis when they occur. The book is good on information, but only lacking in the moral support area. Still, an excellent read, well worth the value."
5,Informative read,"After checking this book out at the local library numerous times, I decided to purchase it. I especially like how it compares the different behaviors and gives suggestions as to how to recognize and then how to help overcome some of these challenges."
5,Resource for SPD,"This is one of those must have guides when finding out your child has SPD. It is very informative, insightful, and inspiring. It helps make sense to a not so well known disorder that affects many."
3,Difficult read,"If you can get past the jargon and can narrow in on what type of child you have, you can skip straight to the sections that apply to your child. Otherwise, it is lengthy and technical. I had done some research on the subject online before reading the book, so it was only somewhat helpful in understanding my son's behavior. I had to highlight sections that applied to him to get my husband to read it and my mother since they wouldn't have made it though the first part. I think the next book will be more helpful, with more strategies for helping my son versus just understanding and diagnosing him."
4,out of sync child,"Excellent resource, written in plain language about sensory integration. Parents and educators can use easy to use check lists and read descriptive antedotes that help determine children's needs. Strategies help the reader comprehend how sensory processing disorder is treated -- fitting need with the body-mind/neuro-biological reasons for the disconnect between how the senses communicate with the mind.The Out-of-Sync Child: Recognizing and Coping with Sensory Processing Disorder, Revised Edition"
3,Good info,"This book is very informative. It has lots of good stuff in it that parents facing SPD need to know. I did struggle to get through it, because it's not very light, fun reading and seems a bit dreary."
5,Help for Out of Sync Parents!,"GREAT! WONDERFUL! I'm not alone! This book described my 5 year old perfectly. I now have a better understanding of him, and therefore have become a better parent to him. Our whole house is now more in sync! A must read for parents of all children!"
3,Great infomation but not an easy read.,This book was full of great ideas and info but it my car manual reads smoother.
3,Coca Tea,An average tea. I have to use 2 bags to get the right flavor. Otherwise it's not bad. Try it you might like it.
5,king of the hill,Was very pleased the the product. I received extremely quick service and would do business again for this and any other product they may have.
5,Not Over the hill,"I am a huge King of the Hill gan and you have got to love a the Texas Family, with moreal snd values. This has always been a very good family show that I have no problem letting my 5 year old watch. In this first season, you can see how it all started. It is kind of neat to see all the early animation, wow how they have come so far in 13 seasons, to back season 14 will be there last, FOX is cancleing them and replacing it with American Dad a show I would not let my Kids watch."
1,Dumb show,This has to be one of the dumbest shows ever it is all hoosiers and they are terrible they all suck even thought it is all animated I would not wish this on my worst enemy
5,Awsome,came in 3 days. This show is awesome can in perfect shape. If you love this show get it! Even used it came in nice quality.
1,Boring show!,"People may hate me for this but I don't think it should be a crime to own an honest opinion.I miss beavis and butt-head the greatist show that mike judge created with great crude and stupidity humor which he should stick to, As for king of the hill it's not even a funny show to me, The main character I hate is hank hill because he's a straight laced guy who takes life too seriously about raising a son and loving so much work all the time and drinking beer out in the back yard with his dimwitted redneck friends boring!Thank god we still have other great hilarious shows like: family guy, the simpsons, futurama & south park. And thank god I'm not the only one who thinks this show sucks, I agree with that other 1 star reviewer.Mike judge who was once my hero has now lost me over to seth mcfarlane.Seth mcfarlane owns mike judge!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Taking place in a far more realistic universe than The Simpsons or the wild, out-of-control Family Guy this show is a little bit more mature and refined. The humor is more grown-up and characters more dense.King of the Hill is way past cool from the very first episode and I am so happy that the first season has been released on DVD. I had no hesitations in buying it right away. It's well worth the money and I eagerly await Season 2 (please make it soon).The extras are pretty cool, with commentaries on certain episodes, loads of funny deleted scenes, a pretty good documentary and a music video. We really couldn't have asked for a better start to King of the Hill on DVD. Bring on the rest!"
5,King Of The Hill - The Complete First Season,"King Of The Hill - The Complete First Season is very entertaining. The episodes are animated and for adult viewing. King Of The HIll - The Complete First Season has episodes that alot of people can relate to like education / school for adults, work / employment issues and raising children. I suggest watching / purchasing King Of The Hill - The Complete First Season!"
2,Not worth it,Too many of the photos seemed contrived; there's much better and much more erotic photography out there. Skip this one.
1,A book with a very misleading sub-title,"Rated with one star only, since there is no way to give it a lower rating. I ordered this book recently but got rid of it practically immediately. It's not even worth a tenth of its price. There is no lust and there is no romance in this book, so its not only the sub-title that's misleading. I'm interested in erotica, in fine art and in photography. But in none of these fields this book is of any interest at all. Actually I don't think it's even worth the paper its been printed and published on."
4,Entertaining and Informative,"This book gives some fascinating information about the daily life of the Aztecs and their neighbors before the Spanish conquest. Marrin succeeds at writing in an unbiased manner, even when it comes to describing horrifying events such as Aztec ritual human sacrifice. The narrative moves along quickly and every sentence is interesting. I often felt I was reading a gripping novel instead of a history book. There are also quite a few photos, maps and drawings."
3,Excellent depending on your desires,"My only negative reservation is that there aren't a whole lot of cartoons presented. Yes, they are full page, but one to a page. I have 2 compilations of New Yorker cartoons (not just political) and they stick two or three on the same page for the most part. Most New Yorker cartoons aren't THAT detailed and they should be able to fit more than one on each page. This is, of course, my opinion and hope, so I was a bit disappointed. It's still a fine book. It just seems to be 'Introduction to New Yorker Cartoons 101 (no credits)'. As that criterium, it is a terrific book. What a fun class it would make!!"
3,"Light on examples, heavy on price","Flash Interactivity and Scripting has good explanations of actionscript concepts...short, and sweet. However, as compared to books at its price point, there are few examples and no CD."
4,ARE YOU TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THIRD DRAWER IS?,"SO I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING WHO THIS COMPANY WAS IF YOU ARE DOING THE SAME PLEASE READ:so i have one of these snowboards i got from someone who got it from someone. never used but looks cool. i have been trying to research the company for a while and i havent really found out much except these snowboards were made by five axis, a company that merged with signal snowboards and continued to make their boards for them.i havent found out to much about quality of the boards but i keep reading that five axis is a good company.and if anyone else knows anything let me know.lisamini01@yahoo.com"
3,"Ok, wish they were softer","I was hoping for a little more cushion when I purchased these, but I still like them. They do the job well."
5,Excellent quality,I was real pleased with the size and quality of this tub mat. It's nice andheavy and the color was very true to color shown in the ad.
1,"Monotone, Boring, and Talentless.","If I had a penny for every time I heard a band that sounded exactly like this, I would have a lot of pennies. Honestly, the sheer simplicity of the songs is astonishing. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities that would make me think otherwise. Well, if you are a Korn fan and are looking for more angry, talentless, boring feces, then this album is for you. Keep in mind that these ae just my opinions. Don't let my judgement reflect your enjoyment."
3,Eh...,"This band feels like old Slipknot with a much weaker voice and less variaty in the instruments. Sure he is angry, but that isn't anything new.Probably the reason this little band broke up. They may have been able to go somewhere if they had gotten a better singer."
1,Hold on to the sell-out,"This c.d. is atrocious. There is no creativity to be found in its tracks. The previous release by Drown,_Hold on to the Hollow_, was nearly a quasi-industrial masterpiece. This release is simply a trendy attempt to milk the market of SoCal metal-rap. This c.d. is so bad that it is depressing, comical, and silent all at the same time. Don't buy it... unless you dig on the SoCal metal-rap trip... then this c.d. will probably be your cup of tea... or nyquil."
2,why sell out?,"Why Korn? Why Coal Chamber? Why sound like this? Buddy, who are you and what have you done with the real Drown? Who kidnapped the true sound of Drown and put these SoCal sellouts in who make music for 12 year olds instead of for angry men?! I remember the good ol' days of when there was a great band called ""Drown"" and they had a great album called ""Hold on to the Hollow"". I just happened upon them and thought they were the one of the greatest industro metal bands out there and I had been waiting for a new album from them for quite a while. Well I see this other ""Drown"", the doppleganger ""Drown"" has come out with an album that might as well be titled ""Follow the Leader""!!"
2,XPW Liberty Or Death,"All matches are from the June 29, 2002 Liberty Or Death event.Angel/Lizzy Borden vs. Veronica Caine/GQ Money in a Raw Sewage Match.Psicosis vs. La Parka.Mexico's Most Wanted vs. New Panthers in a First Round Match for the XPW Tag Team Titles.Altar Boys vs. As Seen On TV.Kaos vs. Chris Hamrick for the XPW Television Title.Terry Funk vs. Webb for the XPW Title."
5,As Expected for an OEM,"This is the OEM replacement filter, so I did not anticipate or have any problems with the quality or fit of the filter. The only thing that might come in handy would have been brief installation instructions. I wasn't even sure where cabin filter was until I did a bit of research online."
3,An OK monitor,The resolution is not as good as advertised and the color is off. It is the low-cost monitor.
1,Defective,"This monitor is not worth the grief to save a few bucks. Mine arrived defective. ""Tech support"" would have been a joke except I was not laughing after spending hours trying to solve the problem alone. They admited that they had no idea and no suggestions. Pay the extra bucks and get a REAL monitor."
3,Christmas Gift,This was a great gift for my mom. She loves the monitor and loves the difference the color can make in this screen versus her old monitor.
4,nice ring,"Very nice ring. Would have gotten 5 stars if it was completely made of Tungsten Carbide. Portion that touches the skin is stainless steel. Then again, maybe Tungsten Carbide is too hard to be able to construct the bottom portion of the same material. Regardless, the ring is very nice."
5,MODERN TALKING----LEAD THE EURO-POP IN THE 1980S,"Modern Talking found a nichewhen they created a synth popdance sound inspired byDonna Summer's early disco albumFrom then on, other groups followedthe lead. Blue System, Bad Boys Blue,Fancy, Joy, and C.C. Catch developedtheir styles in this genre we calledEuro New Wave"
4,4 Stars,"Overall a very nice looking grill. It acctually arrived on a palet inside of a very well packaged box. All the parts were accounted for. In fact, I ended up with an extra pair of top cover hinge rods. I am satisfied with this grill and would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the fact that one of the adjustable door hinges snapped into two halves as I was trying to adjust the doors. It looked to me like faulty material that contributed to this problem. I called Weber and they were happy to send me a new replacement. According to them, this is not a common problem. The part that broke looks like a brass bolt and I would not have expected anything like that to break easily."
5,Great Grill!,I have had this grill for about 2 weeks and am very satisfied. My last grill was a Weber and it was an easy decision to replace with another one (old Weber grill was stolen last summer). Purchased the grill pan for vegetables and fish - a must have for the serious griller. The grill arrived about 2 days earlier than expected. Assembly took about 2 hours with toddlers trying to help.
2,Doesn't grill steaks very well,"I am very disgusted with this purchase. It does not get hot enough to grill steak as you would get using charcoal.If you want your steak with a slightly charred outside and medium rare inside, this is not the grill for you (or me...)."
5,Very Satisfied,"We reviewed several grills prior to purchase. Although the Weber product was at a higher price premium than comparable other brands, both online investigation and personal reccomendations steered us to the Weber. We could not be happier with the quality of the product, it cooks phenomenally well. Should we ever purchase another grill, it will be a weber.Purchasing through Amazon - Although the stainless steel model was on backorder from all retail sites in our area, Amazon was able to deliver it in less than 1 week, which was significantly less than any other source we could get it from.I would also reccomend purchasing the custom cover, which we plan to do."
5,"I have made so many mistakes in the past, but no more!","I have read other consulting how-to guides, but this one really puts me on the path of more satisfied customers and greater profits. Besides going over contracts, it covers useful elements for websites, strategic marketing plans, and even provides methods to market your services (with examples too)! I should have bought this book when I have my first consulting gig in 1992 it would have saved me thousands.If you can't afford this book right now, get a used copy while they are available, go to the library, but what every you do get this book. Consider that my free advice to consultants, if you would like to discuss this further, consultations are available."
4,A Solid Consulting Guide,"This is the first book I bought on the subject of consulting and it served as a reliable guide in taking my first steps when I finally left my former job to launch my practice.It covers all the basics, including how to review and develop your skills inventory, identify and exploit consulting opportunities, sell and market your services etc. Of particular value from my point of view are the chapters on low cost/no cost marketing."
3,Great Resource,This book is a great resource. The author covers everyhing from small details to larger issues. This book is a good resource for people wanting to become a consultant or who are already consulting.
5,Takes away the pain,"I had pain in my elbow for 3 months & tried all the normal stuff to get the pain to go away but it didn't work. So the doctor gave me a cortisone shot in the elbow joint. The cortisone ate away the muscle all around the elbow where the cortisone was shot as well as thinned the skin and took away the skin pigment. To top it all off, the pain did not go away. This stuff is the only thing that worked. I had to take 2 capsules at every meal for the first month to start but the pain goes away and I don't have to take Advil. Eventually, I dropped the lunch dose. You have to see what works for you. Tip: Don't get the cortisone shot - try this stuff first before you take the risk of the shot! You may be one of the few who has a reaction like mine!"
1,Stay Away from Chinese Dog Treats,I purchased this whole pack of treats without realizing they are Made in China. I never fed my dogs the treats and deliberated over throwing them out or not due to all the dog recalls. I finally decided not to risk it and threw them out. Had I known they were made in China I would not have purchased in the first place.
2,fit is terrible,"Do not order htese pads without trying them on- the sizing is very odd. The knee pads in a small/medium are the smallest pads I've ever seen... but they're still gappy under the knee. The elbow pads are fine on the elbow, but really large and gappy on the arm. I'm thinking they need to make more sizes available then the sm/med, lrg/xlrg- they just don't have enough options!Couldn't tell if they protect, since they won't even close!Try triple eight, 187, or tsg instead!"
1,Junk,I wish I had found out about this crappy hardware earlier. My 160GB failed today after ~6 months of use. The outer case was very hot to the touch. The hard drive inside was too hot to hold in your hand. I guess Maxtor forgot about cooling when they designed this. Hopefully I can retrieve some of the data on the drive.....
1,Don't,"I have fried two of these, and lost gigs of data. It can't handle massive backups. You'd think I'd learn after one!"
1,Not Reliable,"I bought my first hard drive and it worked great for 2 weeks until it crashed. Clicking sounds were loud and a dead giveaway that the needle touched the disk. Maxtor sent me another one...worked for another 1 month and 1/2... Same thing. Maxtor will find any excuses for the crash and of course I am to be blamed, after reading several reviews all over the web, it seems that too many people have this issue. Stay away from it!!!"
1,Clicks and Dies. Terrible Product.,"I used this product as the major HDD for a little over a year. Much of the stuff on it (pictures of several years, research papers, and much more) was only on this supposedly reliable drive. It started clicking and went dead. Maxtor customer service refused to offer any help. There must be something very wrong with this product. Don't go near it."
1,I lost five years of data...,"Last week, during the unimaginable worse time (a system re-install), my 5000DV decided to fail. When I finally got back into WinXP, I noticed the drive was inaccessible and would only make clicking noises. Do-it-yourself data recovery tools have not been successful (I've tried many).Needless to say, I was HORRIFIED AND SICK when I realized how much personal data I had lost.So now I will be sending the drive to a professional data recovery service, which charge $1500 and up. Maxtor's web site does list data recovery companies that won't void the drive's warranty. However, had I not ignored the negative reviews regarding reliability before buying, I wouldn't be needing such services now.I've only had my drive for four months."
1,Never buy this Maxtor drive if you value your data!,"I bought this drive in November 2003, and just 2 months later the drive was not accessible. I lost a lot of valuable and irreplaceable data. I have heard similar stories about Maxtor drives from others."
4,Selection of A. Celentano,"I know this artist very well. First time I heard him in 1969.Since that time I have had almost all of his albums.This album is his early staff 1969-1975. Songs are fast in rock'n'roll style.If you like this kind of music this will be good one.However,I think there is a beter albums by him (a lot) One more thing.This guy is the king of italian pop.No one can compare with him by a long shot. Ramazoti,Zuccero,Umberto Tozzi and so on will go to the CD store for a trade or credit after you will get to know his music realy well.This is not my opinion I've heard it from italian guys when I was in Italy.Not all of his albums are good,you need to know which ones to buy. So study it."
3,Not Hardcover,"I ordered this dictionary from langton_info_services_uk and when I received it, it was not a hardcover book, but more like a flimsy journal with typed up entries. There are a fair number of entries, and it has been useful for me, but it was not what I was expecting, and not what is advertised."
2,Women Save Movie,"The writing and direction was real bad, but I don't know what to tell you. I like skin."
4,Refreshing . . . and realistic up to a point,"I am not big into romance novels, and have always found Grace Livingston Hill's books to have too many idealized people . . . too good to be true at times.Fortunately, the hero and heroine of this story seem realistically human, although they are still portrayed as being nicer than most people you meet.It is worth reading, and provides wholesome entertainment where nowadays it is sadly lacking."
2,Another one caught fire,My press caught fire as well!!!!! The press worked well for two years and then this happened. I was surprised to come back to the site where I made the purchase to find another report of the same problem. The distributor was kind enough to offer a refund. I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM REGARDLESS!
2,"Great press, until it caught fire","I enjoyed using this press and it greatly reduced time spent ironing my clothes. It was perfect until one day it started smoking and then caught fire. It was not even two years old, but was past the warranty. Guess I will need a new one, but it won't be this brand."
3,Intrigue,"I read this book reluctantly; not because I had heard of it, but because I hadn't. My mother purchased it for me in a Loblaws store for an incredibly reduced price, and I was wary of the quality.Three years later, I finally picked it up, and found a decent book before me. The narrative is well written, and the story has an okay pace. The best part about this book is that nothing in it is gratuitious - a welcome change in any book. Sex and death are mentioned in passing, and don't take up far too many paragraphs - very well done.My biggest issue with this book is logic - I always look for logic, and there are a few things that rub me the wrong way. I won't mention them, due to spoilers, but I am still asking questions about events that occurred in the middle of the novel days after I finished reading it.All in all, it's a decent book, that I wound neither recommend reading nor recommend not reading."
3,Cute,Its not bad but it could be better. We love Bob the Builder but this is a very simple book of counting items that Bob and his friends work with. I guess it does what the title says but I would just have liked a little more entertainment.
3,Makes good waffles but ....,"Only two compaints I have about this waffle iron... 1) If you overfill you end up with a very hard to clean mess. and 2) First batch of waffles always comes out great but subsequent waffles don't come out as brown.. I found that after making your first batch of waffles, if you turn the temp up until the green light goes out, then wait until you hear the alarm, turn it back down to where you had it then pour your waffle batter in it's fine. Not sure if there is something wrong with the thermostat in mine or they all work that way."
5,A Great Little Waffle Iron !,"This one is for when a pair of Belgian waffles will do and you have very limited appliance storage space. It works great with precise temperature control and it even beeps when the waffle is done. If you've made your batter right, you can't make a bad waffle with this iron. Another plus is its ""retro"" styling. It's very pleasing to the eye. It's a Cuisinart !"
5,Makes great Belgian waffles!,My old waffle iron gave out after about 20 years so I wanted one that would work as well but make the thicker Belgian style waffles. This Cuisinart is very good. It has a temperature control so you can choose how well done you like your waffles. It heats up very quickly and beeps when the temperature has been reached. It also beeps when the waffles are done. They do not stick and clean up is easy if you overfill a little. I'm very happy with this purchase and from the look of how it's made it should last another 20 years. I just hope that I do too!
3,Troubles With Waffle Iron,"The waffle iron arrived with a broken hinge. The three-year warrently helped me decide to buy it, but after it arrived I discovered I had to pay postage to return it and send $10 to cover return mpostage. So I pached up the broken hinge and am using it. It makes belgium waffles OK."
5,great waffles,Makes great waffles...reminds of the ones I got at the World's Fair when I was a kid...
2,Teflon comes off,"This waffle maker works OK, but the coating on the top element has bubbled and chipped off in places despite gentle care. Can't use."
2,looks great but fell apart after a few months use,I got this for christmas and use it every weeked till summer. It looks great and did a good job. I made all different types of waffles. By the end of the summer about 9 months the teflon coating began to peal off. My understanding is that the stuff is toxic so I got rid of it I will look for a better quality teflon coating next time.
3,"Not perfect, but still a great iron","I bought this for my father last Christmas and it's been pretty good. It's very easy to use and makes decent waffles (though I wish they were a little more crispy, they can be soggy sometimes). Be careful not to overfill the trays with batter because it makes a huge mess when it leaks and oozes everywhere and it's kind of difficult to clean.Overall we really enjoy this iron and use it all the time. It just takes some practice to make the perfect waffle."
1,Poor design - Buy something else.,"My experience was similar to another user, initial waffle was great, subsequent ones were not. I had many issues with the thermostat 2 days after the one year warrantly. Its a mess to clean up it if overflows becuase the way it is designed - two parts screwed together leave space for the mix to overflow into. Its a clean up nightmare and given the qestionable thermostat, inconsistent output I was very disappointed with this Cuisinart purchase."
4,"LYRICAL, MUSICAL, HOOKEY...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED","think mellow del amitri... purely musical and lyrical...the perfect romantic date as long as your idea of (or being) the the perfect date is showing up with flowers in one hand and a bottle of wild turkey in the other, barefoot...something interesting and contagiously listenable about this album. you must have it."
5,This series is always fun,"Another installment of a very fun series, featuring the return of Countess Lydia Ouspenska. Charlotte MacLeod is reliable, as always."
5,"This is a gem among gems, truly.","I love this book. First and foremost, unlike most other books for romantically-underdeveloped men, this one is written by two very intelligent women, who support their recommendations with actual research and statistics. Right now, I am re-reading this book because I don't want any of its wisdom to elude me. I believe that now, having read this wonderful book, I am able to develop into a better boyfriend and future husband for my One and Only."
2,It was ok....,It lists lots and lots of things to do but it never tells the man why it is really important or how that $23 ring that she just tried on isn't about the ring but the heart of a little girl.With that some of the suggestions I can see being ok but for the most part it seemed to me the writer had to really reach for ideas. It makes me wonder....
3,Presented as a manual yet lacking in substance.,I would definately purchase from this seller again. This item arrived exactly as presented in a speedy and efficient manner.I found the read to be strenuous although it was well written I simply found the context to be lacking any useful insight. Perhaps better utilized as an entrance 101 based foundation.
3,Large Pieces are great- shipping cost will ruin the deal,"We just received our Graveyard kit and the large Tombstones are perfect! There is a nice variety of shapes which is why we chose this product. The small pieces are worthless, unless they are being used for indoor or tabletop settings. Unfortunately, I did not notice the individual shipping cost on this box since I ordered a huge amount of Halloween stuff on the same order. The shipping cost is excessive for the minimal weight of the box and is actually more than half the cost of the graveyard. At this point, Im not going to return it. But BUYER BEWARE. Happy Halloween!"
1,WHO EDITED THIS MOVIE?,"As a fellow reviewer lamented, this is one bad movie. Olivier Gruner is passionless and boring. Gary Hudson as the bad prison guard is offed by a prisoner (I think)--editing problem # 1 out of several. Gail Harris as the girlfriend is in a coma, then someone tries to kill her, she's okay and next thing you know, she's dead??? Where did that come in?Pointless, trite, definitely not worthy to inspire another sequel. Yuck!"
5,the circuit II,It had a lot action in it and I really enjoyed watching a good martial arts movie thank you.
1,"Crap, crap crap","I watched a few minutes of this and found myself unable to watch any more.Once my son, when he was eleven, left the DVD's out in the open and wouldn't pick up after himself, I removed all the DVD's from the room, stowed them away elsewhere and told him I'd wait two week before I brought one or two out at a time.I left HICK TREK out. TV and Video addict that he was, he couldn't bear to bring himself to watching it. ""It's awful,"" he said.When a little kid won't watch something like this, you know it's a pile of animal waste. Flies might like it."
5,Superb as always,"-Once again Oasis prove that they can do tear jerking ballads as well as straight out rockers, their depth is show in this masterpiece that is essential to any Oasis fan for the 2 great B-Sides with ""Shout It Out Loud"" in particular being another great song to add to Noel Gallaghers catalogue of powerful tracks. Ignore the idiotic critics who simply dismiss Oasis's new stuff, I'm confident in their ability to release great music regardless of the fools who want them to churn out another ""Definately Maybe"" it ain't gonna happen people so get the hell over it and enjoy one of the few bands around that can still rock like no other."
3,Don't bother choosing a color!!!!!,"Don't buy from this company if you are attached to a specific color! I specifically purchased several of the same color. I received every ugly color but the one I requested! I chose this company because of the option of ordering a specific color rather than the same product being available for less from other companies without that choice. The product however, is the best on the market (I've tried them all!!!) it does at times break at the handle.....I've gone through several over the years."
4,Great watch!,"This is a very nice watch. The display is easy to read and you can have two different times going at once. Great for travel over time zones when you want to flip back to see what time it is at ""home"".My only complaint and reason for not giving it 5 stars...I uses Off bug repelant once and it stained the band. So now it's spotted. I would think with it being a sports watch that wouldn't be an issue."
5,Name says it all,"Hilarious a good read for any gal who wants some insighton her mate,boss or whoever. Not too happy bout the print(I must have got a bad copy). Even if you think you know the [guy],you still won't."
5,Only for people with a sense of humor,Sick of dating duds? This book has the answer. The trick is to avoid bastards. How do you spot a bastard? Any man with a star sign is a bastard. The solution: Find a man without a star sign...
4,I like it but do you really ...,"It's a good book, i like it. It shows you the traits associated with astrological signs (or humans) in a negative but hillarious way.You can have good laughs by reading the book, but definitely it's gonna have a negative effect on you too. You might not feel good, cause the book is accurate but all it tells is bad. In the end you might be thinking, wouldn't it be better if you didn't knew it all. My suggestion, avoid if you can. It helps you realize negative side of people and maybe the negative aspects you are not conciously aware of.In the end, once again, great book but for positive thinkers, ""Astrologically incorrect"" would be a greater one."
4,Sounds familiar,"Hits it on the nose. While reading this book, you'll find yourself nodding and saying ""Yea, I know that man"" quite often. A fun man-bashing book, but it's a fast read, and I'd rather have borrowed it from the library or a friend than have paid for it, because after the fun and giggles it loses it's usefulness. Not a book I'll be turning to down the road, but every woman should read it."
1,Not What I accepted,"I was very disappointed with this book. I was hoping for it to actually help me be able to recognize the traits of each sign. I found the book to over-generalize and focus too much on actually dating each sign, instead of being able to tell if someone is a certain sign. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Are you kidding me or what?,I was amazed. All I can say is that the authors must be a couple of mental furballs. Some is funny but the vitriol laying beneath the surface made it clear that this was just a gripe book about their obviously failed relationships. I doubt either author could stand their own scrutiny. Clearly they are destined to be manless throughout time as only men powered by the brain stem would have them. No higher functions are required.
4,Invaluable,"Does anyone remember the ""Observer"" series from when you were little (Observer's book of Birds/Cars/Mushrooms etc)?This is very similar but works in reverse: find out your subject's species (aka starsign) then discover more about his habitat, behavioural flaws, physical imperfections and,(occasionally) redeeming features....Seriously, I bought this book for a girls night in and we were all surprised at how accuratley it describes the majority of the bastards we've we ""spotted"".....why wasn't it around 10 years ago?An invaluable handbag size guide no girl should be without."
4,Every Woman should have a copy!,"I bought this book for my sister a few years ago and we were both laughing out loud when I was reading some stuff to her... I had to get my own copy too which I just recently bought. It is brutal, but SO DEAD ON! It is great for a girls night in party or just if you need a good laugh on your own!"
2,Bought for cover art,"I really bought this book for the cover art to frame and hang in my library. But I did read through the book first, and it is not really a good or acurate astrology book. It is obviously written by a woman or women that have problems dating men and really really really hate men.This is really just a humor book and should have been put in the humor section rather than the astrology section, but I am glad I found it, because the cover art makes a fantastic display!"
5,A perfect Valentine for those not in love,"Love is blind, you can never see the loves of your life for what they are when you're with them. Hindsight gives you much clearer vision and this book lets you have a lot of fun looking back. It's the perfect Valentine's day gift for your girlfriends who aren't in happy couple mode, and for any woman in the post break-up phase - laughter is the best way to keep loneliness and heartbreak at bay."
3,Didn't last long,"Of the three pump rocket sets I bought for my child's birthday party, this was the one which got destroyed almost immediately. The rockets sometimes stuck on the tube and the base was very flimsy and didn't hold up to the 30 kids' enthusiastic play. It lay in twisted ruins by the end of the day.Good for a few hours."
1,This product is difficult for younger toddlers - not durable either.,Plastic airbag is made of a tough plastic such that it is difficult to collapse under teh weight of 4&5 yr olds even when the jump on it. Plastic air tube flimsy and stand for this is not durable. We bought this because a neighbor had a similar one which was incredibly durable and easy to use for even our 2yr old. The air bag was made of softer maleable plastic. Save your $10... look at another product instead.
4,try if you like . . .,try this if you like altough the tax and shipping is more than half of the toy itself . . .
4,cheap fun,"My son and husband enjoy the popular ""Air Hogs"" cheapo-airplanes that are powered by a little hand-held battery operated device. This rocket was next to them on the toy store shelf. It is cute and cheap, just like the air hogs. It gets them outside together and if you hit the air bladder right, the rockets really flies! There are several ""rockets"" in the package so littler siblings can run around collecting them, then get a turn when they are all returned. Rockets are very lightweight and will not hurt anyone if they land on someone's head. This is VERY inexpensivly made, so be gentle carrying it around. Ours has not broken yet, but I can see that it would be easy to tear the tube in a tug of war between children. :)"
5,Great for adults!,"I bought an earlier version of this toy more than 10 years ago. We used it during dull moments in the office; it takes careful angling to get it to go over a nearby cube wall, not hit the suspended ceiling, and come down again as far away as possible. It was great!Now my kids are using it. They're 3.5 years old, and we only point it straight up. At their size and coordination, the rockets only go 4-10 feet in the air, which is just fine. Sometimes the rockets bonk them on the head, but they are lightweight and don't fall hard, so it's not a problem."
3,These are tiny!,I bought these online. When I received them I found they are very very tiny. So if you want a bell this may not be for you. If you want a cute trinket then go for it. You can also get these at Micheals Craft store.
3,Just another addition,"The mini wedding bells were nice decorations, however they were just another addition to the many decorations we already had. I recommend only ordering maybe one set of these bells instead of one for each guest."
1,Silver wedding bells review,I would not recommend this item. When we received bells they were gold. They didn't ring loud at all. In order to get them to ring you had to shake the card so hard that the ribbon would come loose. We were very disappointed with this product.
2,Just ok,The cards are quite thin and a little cheap looking. The bells were missing a lot of their dangle piece so they wouldn't even ring when the guests shook them. Would not purchase again.
2,Wedding bells,Was much smaller than i expected them to be. Looked bigger in the picture. They are barely audible and i will have to keep looking for appropriate bells.
1,"So disappointed, they are super tiny!","Seriously tiny, bad quality, they don't make any noise, none would be able to hear these super tiny bells...don't waste your money."
5,Ring the bell for a kiss!,Just what I was looking for! Love the little cards attached to the bells. They will work great for our wedding!
3,Exactly what you see in the picture,"I received 100 of these little cards with a bow and a bell. That's all they are. If paired up with a little wedding-theme card/picture holder, these could look good. However, they look rather cheap (ie, just a card, little bell and ribbon). You will want to pair it with something else to maybe disguise the flimsy look."
5,Excellent skill builder using the Princess Gang,"I agree with the other reviewer, there are WAY too many cards in this game, 72 cards to be exact! That is crazy for the recommended age, 3 years and up. Instead of putting our game back on the shelf for a few years, I simply let my 4 year old daughter pick out 12 pairs of cards of her choice, and then play with that small amount (which is how I remember the original Memory game being, with about that amount of cards). She enjoys picking her favorite pairs for the game, and has really enjoyed learning to remember the hidden cards. We played four or five rounds yesterday, and she gets better at it each time. This is such an important game to have in your house, it really gets your brain rolling. Lots of fun too!"
5,Louisiana Grammie,My three old granddaughter loves this game. I started her off with only 8 pairs until she got the hang of the game. Then I've kept adding pairs. I think it is very educational in helping them concentrate and keeps them focused.. Would recommend this to any family at any age.
2,Images are too similar!,"I do not like this game, and my daughter doesn't either. There are way too many similar pictures in the set of cards. We only play with half of them anyway, but they are still very similar. Also there is nothing on the back of the tiles to help you lay them out all the same way. Some of them are always upside down or sideways. We like Dr. Seuss matching MUCH better. The pictures are all different, there is a logo on the back of each tile so that you can lay them out properly, and it's overall more fun. My daughter picks Dr. Seuss matching over the Disney game every time."
4,Memory Game for my 4 year old Granddaughter,"Gave this game to my four year old Granddaughter and she really likes it. I think it is very educational, in that it really challenges their memory skills. My Granddaughter is already very good at it."
4,Great fun for the family!,"Got this for my 4, soon to be 5, year old niece for the holidays and she and my kids (3 & 6) loved playing! Kept them busy and excited for at least an hour +!"
2,I bought the wrong toy.,"I thoug it works with leappad, but for my surprise it works with leap books. How I live abroad, I Couldnt see it working. But the sell and the deliver was great."
4,LeapFrog LeapPad: The Incredibles,"My son is in kindergarten and he liks this particular one because he watched The Incredibles from TV and he is familiar with the story. Whenever I tell him to do leapPad, he will pick the incredibles out of 20 different story."
5,Raw Zeppelin!,Got the Montreux book for Christmas. It's a great trip back to when hippies roamed the earth. Are any of you guys left? :-) I wish there were more pics of Bonham but other than that it's very cool. Now if we can only get some Montreux VIDEO that would be great!
3,Valuable Creation,"What a fabulous book! The photography is spectacular! I enjoyed the journey to the years of 1970, 1971, and 1972. Learning about Montreux, Swizerland was fun. Considering Page and Plant just recently performed in Montreux, Switzerland on July 7, 2001 the book is fresh and timely. Chateau and Rapallo have created something beautiful here that compliments the music that Led Zeppelin created. Nice that proceeds go to Page's charity."
2,What's this book about?,"It seems that Gilles Chteau worried more about remarking the history of his Montreux Communauté and student time rather than bringing us any new fact about Led Zeppelin.Being honest, I expected much more from this book. For example, interviews with Jimmy, Robert, Jonesy and Bonzo, pictures of their stay in Switzerland, etc, etc.I really don't care about the local scene, since it seems to be OBVIOUS that, in the early '70s, the hippie thing was wide spread over Europe. What I wanted to see/read was something I didn't know about LZ, specially in '72, which I consider an important turning point in their careers.It means that only the hardest Zepheads will find this book useful in some way, like knowing petty details, such as their setlists, etc. Definetely, not a best-buy."
2,Nice pictures,"I think this is the first publication from Rapallo. This is a nice picture book. It contains very rare photos of Zeppelin, plus the Swiss hippies who lived in Montreaux in the 1970's. However, I am disappointed by the paucity of text contained. Not enough information. Plus, as nice as the photos are, they were not arranged in any cohesive order. It took a while to figure out which pictures belonged to which year."
2,At least it's about Led Zeppelin,"This is a book for hardcore Led Zeppelin collectors only. The photos are black and white and pretty unspectacular. If you've read 'Led Zeppelin: The Press Reports' by Robert Godwin, you won't find anything new here, except for a drawn out tribute to the concert organizers and their hippie friends, and a travel brochure description of the picturesque city of Montreux. The prose is high school level English. The good thing about this book is some of the money goes to charity."
1,A real disappointment!,"I was really impatient to hold it between my hands, but when I got this book my first impression was:Why have they called this book ""Led Zeppelin - The Montreux Concerts""?Gilles Chateaux describes very well the life during the 70' in this splendid city but to document itself on the Zepp concerts in Switzerland, I would rather advise you to seek the originals ""Rock and Folk"". The concerts are longer described and have as many interesting photos.The only positive point being that part of the benefit will be useful for the ABC Trust foundation."
4,not a long enough workout,"For all the careful instruction of how to do the poses, I was taken aback by how short the workout was in the end. While this tape is an excellent source for learning how to correctly do the postures, you should probably use it in conjuction with another tape that actually gives you workout."
5,The stuff is great,"I like this stuff---it feels very refreshing in the morning. The scrub itself has a nice exfoliating effect, smells pretty neutral."
5,In love with this product.,This product works great. The scrub is gentle but effective. It smells good and leaves the skin soft and refreshed.
5,The best acne facial cleanser I've ever used,"Of all the facial cleansers I've tried over the years, this one has worked the best without over-drying my skin. I've used this or one of its store brand knock-offs for the past 3 years, after rotating through several brands that either didn't work against acne or would over-dry my skin. My face feels much fresher, clearer, and lighter after using it, the scrub feels like it really exfoliates your skin without being abrasive at all. This product has salicylic acid, but doesn't cause the problems other acne cleansers has when you use or overuse them. And even at stores, this scrub is usually priced really well. I REALLY recommend it for light to moderate acne or as a facial scrub. I even use it on my arms sometimes."
5,A shower staple,I have used this scrub for a while now. I have noticed that when I do run out of the product i break out. This scrub does a good job clearing oils from my face.
5,Best stuff ever!,This is the only product I will use on my face! I have used it daily for years and. Do not feel clean without it. Finally convinced my teenage son to start using it an he has had a lot of improvement with his acne. I usually buy this in bulk because we use so much of it. You can't beat the price for a great product!
2,"Nice scrub, but doesn't do much for blackheads","I really wanted to love this product based on what I've read about it, but I can't really say that it has done much for blackheads. The places on my face where I occasionally suffer major breakouts are my chin and nose, and I have not seen differences there. I actually had two blackheads pop up on my chin the day after using this scrub. I continued to use it hoping that it would stop the breakout from getting worse, but nothing. The blackheads only went away after using another brand of acne wash. The fact that I had a small breakout a day after using the scrub could have been purely coincidental, but it was enough to stop me from using it on those areas. I still use the scrub on the rest of my face, firstly because I paid for it, but also because it's a decent face wash. It exfoliates the skin well and leaves it pretty soft, and it smells great. However, that's as much as I can say about this product. For me, it has not done what it's meant to do."
2,Clears skin but no help on blackheads,"I used the whole tube of this product and I would say that it does help with the acne, but nothing on blackheads. I have very stubbron and alot (ew) of blackheads and this did nothing. I still have a few pimples after using this product for my main face wash. I'm trying a new product now to see if it gets rid of my blackheads"
3,"Alright product,","It does not clear up skin, and it really doesen't improve your skin much overall.It does smell DELICIOUS and it does leave your skin softer, but it really doesent do much."
5,ST IVES,ST IVES is my favorite face mask I love the way they fill on your face and the after fects of this product is just so amazing I love it. Leah
1,Not,Not the product pictured. You end up getting the orange bottle. I contacted St. Ives directly and they stopped selling the blue bottle over a year ago. This seller should really update their website.
5,Excellent product,"Thank you very much. I love how clean the face wash leaves my skin but it also makes it firmer, since I am older that is amazing. Thanks again."
5,Works great.,This product really does work. Just be careful around your eyes. I like to put it on and leave it for a few minutes and then scrub it off with a washcloth. It seems give it time to work. It also helps keep it off your eyelids this way. I used it in the shower at first and had flaky eyelids that freaked me out until I figured out what was happening.
5,tried it first time and liked it,among different products I tried this one stands out. The quality of this product was the best for me. It has a very nice smell. I did rate only quality not the price.
4,"I LIKE THE TEXTURE,THE SMELL NOT SO MUCH...","I LIKE THIS PRODUCT,GOOD PRICE AND IT DOES THE JOB.THE TEXTURE IS NICE,BUT I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE SMELL...SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN EAT...BUT I THINK IS A GOOD PRODUCT."
3,meh,"Its ok, but it can be baught at any store for the same price. It didnt seem to work any better or worse than any other ""exfoliating"" scrub that I have used before."
1,complete garbage,"works identically to the stuff I bought from the dollar store. has virtually zero exfoliating ability, and leaves skin feeling waxy.I am a fan of the regular apricot scrub but this product is useless."
2,Made me break out more!,"After using this product, my blackheads have doubled, I have 3 new zits, and my skin feels no smoother whatsoever. Didn't appreciate that at all! This just wasn't the scrub for me."
4,Great for Scouts!,"I have used this book at a summer camp for activities, and it was great! It offers up a lot of great ideas. My mom bought this about 10-15 years ago when I was a Brownie and now I'm using it! If you're looking for science activities for your Girl Scout troop, definitely buy this book!"
5,Full of science fun,This is a book the kids get out when they are bored and want to do something fun. It could be used for homeschool or just to have around the house when the kids get bored.
1,Tons of errors,"This book is a joke. I have never seen so many errors. People, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this book. Even if someone offers you a free copy, RUN don't walk AWAY from it."
2,Incorrect information,"If the material in this book can be rated by just one of the ""artist bio's"" then it is faulty and misleading. I looked at Tom Russel and was surprised by his birth date of 1955. This means he graduated from Loyola High School when he was 9 years old. We were classmates and 17 at the time."
4,Very helpful book.,"My wife and I wanted to start exploring country music, but didn't know where to start. Musichound Country is a great guidebook to country CDs. Especially helpful is the list of ""5 bone"" albums in the back of the book. A nice place to start building your country music collection. If you're interested in country music, you'll probably like this book. We sure do."
1,Numerous errors,My first time paging through it and checking listings at random I found over twenty errors. Don't they get fact checkers for these books?
4,Real fights,"Well I have received this DVD with 5 girlfights + 1 short one. I think that the fights was well done. As far as I can see, the fights was real fights. It is not the best fights I have seen on DVD/VHS over the last years, but I think I can recommend the DVD to other who are looking for real girlfights on DVD."
1,Brawlin Broads,"This dvd sucks!!! Its is only about 20 minutes long,and they show the same girls fighting over and over to make it seem longer.Besides that there are only 3 fights on the whole dvd,all 3 fights are weak!The brothers on this dvd are stale and corny. I rate this dvd 3 thumbs down. The shipping is extremely slow and the company selling this dvd doesn't honor it's own return policies.Truly a waste of money and time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Tarnished Nickel,I like the shape and it is the only one that Icould find that would work with my existing piping but the polished nickel finish looks like tarnished nickel.
5,works no tangles,Product works. I do move components around quite a bit and this cable has had no tangles and seems durable. Good pricing.
1,"attractive, but does not self-set","I give this clock high marks for attractiveness. People really like the way it looks. However, I have only been able to get it to detect the radio signal one time. It does not correct the time on its own, and it did not change to DST when required. So basically, in the end, forget about the radio-control thing. If you like the way it looks (it is HUGE), then enjoy. Don't expect that it will automatically set itself, because that part is evidently faulty.I have tried putting it in different locations, etc., to pick up the signal. No dice. It's just an inferior product in this regard. I have three other radio-controlled clocks (two digital, one analog), and they all keep perfect time, and set themselves automatically. So my feeling is that this Chaney clock uses an inferior technology. So again, buy it if you like the looks, not for accurate time-keeping."
2,Low quality arm movement; hour hand sticks at 6,"Looks great, had no problem setting it.However, the hour hand is not rigidly attached to the movement, and so is a bit floppy, and gets stuck on the thermometer, causing it to stop at 6. The minute hand continues to work fine, but I have no idea what hour it is. Taking the clock down from where it's hung and holding it face down will get it unstuck until 6 rolls around again.Will return for something similar that doesn't have anything to get the hands stuck on."
1,clock is a failure,"Just received the clock, it LOOKS great. However it's sold as a copper clock not copper colored! It certainly does not look or feel like our other copper temperature guage or lights that we have outdoors.Tried to set the atomic clock, it beeped and beeped and then nothing. So we tried again, it beeped and beeped and again nothing. Next we set is as a analog clock and it gained 5 mins in 20 mins. Time flies by quickly enough. (Don't need this)Unfortunately, this clock is worthless and I am sending it back right now.Don't buy it unless you just want yard art."
1,lousy clock ... doesn't work at all,"This Chaney radio controlled clock, which I bought from Amazon, is one year old and doesn't work at all. Actually, that's not true. The hands do move ... it just doesn't keep time at all. Nice looking but utterly useless. I strongly discourage anyone buying this clock; you will just be throwing your money out."
3,Any woman can be a lesbian,"0h the sexes do battle they batter about. l'll return to the bosom where my journey ends, WHERE THERE'S N0 PENlS BETWEEN US FRlENDS!!!This wonderful litty ditty was brought to my as well as many other's attention thanks to the King 0f All Lesbians, Howard Stern. ''View From Gay Head'' (try saying that w/o giggling) is basically the ''Stairway To Heaven'' of this collection, while the rest is basically...eh.Had Alix done this 2O years later, she would've made a much more mainstream impact, rather than be a remote footnote in lesbianic history. Who knows, maybe she could've had a cameo in the ''Ellen'' coming out episode."
2,people bomb,first of all I can't believe what I paid for the VHS that was used. The seller had some nerve.I think the video is outdated and biased. I ordered to show to my class but only showed to one period.
4,That's Karen,"Karen is an excellent instructor. She seems to always challenge you and keeps things simple. Easy to follow and a very effective work-out. When you are done you know you just worked your butt, legs and tummy in a unconventional way, which keeps things exciting and not boring. Plus she is pleasant to look at and listen to."
2,Didn't do anything,"This is the first DVD I bought to use my exercise ball, and I was a little disappointed. The workout is VERY short. I mean, I am out of shape, and I think the only reason I was sweating was from laying on plastic for 15 minutes. I must say it does help you to target muscles pretty well. But I would not recommend it if you want any sort of cardio workout."
5,A Must Have!!,"I am an avid exerciser, own about 10 different exercise DVD's and go to the gym at least three times a week. So, not too many things have an effect on my body anymore. Not so with this video. When I completed the video for the first time, I thought, ""Well that was a complete waste of 25 minutes."" But the next day, my mind was definitly changed. My body was sore for the first time in over a year! The pace of the DVD is deceiving. You don't break a sweat and it's over before you know it, but you will definitly feel the results the next few days. I have owned the DVD for over a year and every time I complete it, I am sore the next day. By far the best buy I have ever made!"
4,Great for bad backs,"I recently bought this video to use with my stability ball and am very happy with it. Normally, the exercise videos annoy me (don't forget to breathe....) but this one doesn't. It is very specific, which is great so that I don't accidentally hurt myself. It is also really good for bad backs...the exercises are tough but don't put stress on your back at all. I would highly recommend this video. The only thing that I wish was different about it is the length. I would rather have a longer workout than just 20 minutes."
5,great workout,"i'm a 54yr old guy and i just got my first excercise ball this week...i do a lot of walking and hiking but have been reinjurying my lower back muscles over and over again.after much research i realized that my core muscles were weakand i needed to strenghten them with the Ex balli bought this dvd to show me how to use the ball.(i bought my ball online for only $16 and the dvd $9.99 at target)this dvd workout allowed me to really work on those core muscles in my lower back ,hip etc....the stretching felt wonderful with the ball cushioning my movements.. when i woke up this morning my lower back felt great.. as if i had had the best massage possible in my most chronically sore areas ..i've already done this workout again today and look forward to doing it tomorrow."
3,Good morning workout - but don't expect any more than that,This is a good warming up for the day morning workout for when you are really tired. It is mellow and pretty easy. If you want any kind of real workout then this isn't the one for you. I had this on my wish list until my sister got this as a gift and I got to try it. I took it off my wish list tonight.
3,"Fun, but not very challenging","I broke my back about two years ago, I agree with a previous reviewer that this video is great for people with back problems. The video is fun, but the actual exercise time is only about 15 minutes, plus an addition 5 minutes each for warm-up and cool-down. Also, though Karen warns the viewer that a mat and one of her genie balls is needed, her cuing for when to use these is poor (which if you have any of her other videos, this is out of character). I had to pause my DVD player to get set up."
3,"Ok, could have been better",I have other videos of Karens and so I am very familar with her teaching style and workouts. I found this particular workout to be on the easy side for her. Many of her workouts are challenging and you feel it after but this was not that challenging for me and the length was short.I have done stability ball workouts from a fitness show on tv that were much more challenging.
1,"B.L.T. = boring, low energy, tiresome","I regret buying this. The workout is 25 minutes long, and doesn't come close to breaking a sweat. (The abs and legs routines are about 10 minutes each, followed by 5 minutes of stretching.) I'm reintroducing myself to exercise and thought this would be a fun way to start, but it's not, especially since i feel like i'm not accomplishing anything. (I suspect intermediate and advanced exercisers will feel even worse.)Karen Voight is a better trainer than most. She doesn't suffer from hyper-perkiness that can irritate exercisers. However, her counts often feel ""off"" to me, which is either a result of bad editing or bad musical selections. All in all, this isn't worth the money I spent on it. Find yourself a better, longer and more challenging DVD - this is coming from a couch potato, which should tell you a lot."
3,Fun Workout!,"I just bought this DVD and first used it today. The workout is pretty simple and easy to follow along with. Just make sure that the stability ball you buy is big! I made the mistake of assuming that it would not really matter what size ball I got, and the cover of the DVD did not specify. But It was very hard to do some of the steps with a small ball-almost impossible. Also I did not really like the butt and legs section of the workout, some of the moves were too complicated and I was doing them all wrong so I didnt feel anything in my legs. The Abs part was great though! I think I will just do the warm up and abs part of this video over and over and skip the rest."
5,Lexmark Black Inkjet Cartridge,"I have been quite pleased with these cartridges. However, I would like to find the long-life one and didn't see it on the list of available cartridges. This one is the medium life one."
5,speedy delivery,"this product, lexmark black print cartridge is just what it says it is. this is the same i purchase in stores,however, it is a wee bit less expensive but to have it delivered to my door in just 3 days is remarkable"
3,Deceptive,"Product seems to be working well, my problem with the company is that they never mention in their internet site that this is a refurbished cartridge. When I called the company they said that I should have known that from the price. Sorry, I was not ink cartridge price savy!!!"
2,Poor value and performance,"I disliked this product since it delivered little ink and lasted only for a few pages. Don't bother getting this, it is not worth it. The ink delivery was bad too."
3,inkjet,I received the product in a timely manner but this cartridge seemed to run out quicker than usual. Maybe I printed more.
5,Perfect Match,I am always scared of buying these kinds of product online. I took a chance and bought the Lexmark Catridge #17 and it was the perfect match.It arrived on time and was cheaper than the store price.
1,Not happy with black ink cartridge OR colored one,The cartridge was apparently dried. I unwrapped it from a sealed container. Carefully inserted it and no print appeared. I carefully checked my printer and tried several more times. I then bought a new black cartridge at greater expense and it worked fine immediately. I shall not purchase ink cartridges from Amazon again since the same thing happened with the color cartridge.
1,Blank InkCartridge,This product (ink Cartridge) arrived either dried up or already empty. I will not purchase from this source again.
3,"Rec'd quickly, thanks.",Recieved quickly. But this cartridge runs out too soon.Hmmm? Says it is for moderate use.
1,Runs dry QUICKLY!,"This is not a good deal at all. If you have to buy ink more than twice as frequently and save less than 25%, it is a ripoff."
4,Great Pen,Great pen for the money. Black coating looks nice and keeps the floors from getting scratched. Only issue was the rod that keeps the pen closed had a nut at the bottom that was hard to unscrew at first. Also the door is in the middle of the fence so it was slightly hard for my toy poodle to jump the lower portion to get in and out. But the size and configuration flexibilty is great and easy to collapse and carry around.
5,It's a Play Pen For Puppies,"This is exactly what my puppy needed. We tried to confine him in a specific area with cardboard...that didn't work. We tried the bathroom, that didn't work. With this play pen he can see all around him and he never yelps. He sees us, we see him and he's happy! His wood dog crate fits in there too, which makes a perfect confined area while we are at work. He has room to play, sleep, and do his bussiness. (He's still a puppy in training!) It folds up easy for travel too! I highly reccommend this play pen!"
5,Great Speakers,"Purchased these speakers for my office and installed them in my panel cieling in the lobby for my clients to have some music to listen to. The sound quality is impressive, very crisp, and clear. I don't think KEF makes a bad speaker. I am streaming Pandora radio through my Onkyo receiver and am very happy with the sound quality. I would definitely reccomend these speakers."
3,It tastes funny......,But I can tell you one thing....it tastes so goooooooooooooood if you add berry juicy juice to it. I had it at my cousin's house and it was GREAT with a g. Try it!!!!!!!!!
4,great condition!,everything was in great condition; better than if i had bought the same used book at my school's bookstore! very satisfied
2,"Comprehensive, but pretty dry","The information in this guide is good. But it seems to be written for lawyers and other professionals, because it's almost unreadable. Really, really dry stuff. I suppose it's hard to make this kind of thing interesting, so I didn't expect it to be fun. But this failed at making the information even palatable.If you're in an absolute bind (meaning facing a hearing that could result in getting kicked out of school) then maybe it's worth it. Otherwise, give it the skip. It's not what I'd call ""pleasure reading.""[...]"
2,An okay introduction to picking.,"I'm not an experienced picker, collector, or dealer so, after reading this book, I had tons of questions I didn't have before.It seems to me an awful lot of text was used without saying very much. Throughout the entire read I felt like the author was making promises to teach and reveal without giving much away. Maybe it's the nature of the people in this field of interest.It's not a ""bad"" book but it's in no way a ""tell all"". It's more like having a picker over for an informal ""career day"" discussion."
2,Rocket ride into HTML,"This is a rocket ride of a book. It stars with Textpad, then flies into Photoshop, then back into Textpad for a quick ride through the basics of HTML and CSS. There is some reference at the end, but frankly it's too little too late. The back of the book exhorts that you don't have to know everything to get your job done, and while that may apply to other fields like Powerpoint or Word, it doesn't work here. You need to understand the fundamentals of HTML if you want to go past the examples shown here.For a complete introduction starting with the fundamentals I recommend O'Reilly's excellent HTML & XHTML : The Definitive Guide."
3,Reissue of 1991 sertanejo album.,"Brazilian sertanejo from the Northeast is considered hick music... The artists dress up like cowboys, and the songs sound quite a bit like Mexican rancheras. Gino e Geno are stars of the genre, and this early album is okay for what it is... But it's also a bit dull, at least to outsiders. Still, if you want to check the style out, this album from 1991 is a pretty good example."
3,Only 192k for MP3,Worthy of note is that the MP3 downloads of this album are only 192k and not the claimed 256k (at least for the two tracks I downloaded - Thinking of You and Outside of Heaven).
1,"5 stars for the music, 1 star for the concept.....","I am a major fan of ABBA, but why was this collection necessary? It seems to be an all-too obvious attempt by Polygram to bilk more money out of the ""completists"" fans who have to buy every single compilation album by their favorite group, no matter how many times the songs have been re-released....(and released.....and released.....etc......) Everything on this CD has been included on SEVERAL other albums. Polygram would better serve ABBA's legion of fans by dipping into the vaults and finally releasing all the ""missing"" catalog tracks that have never seen the light of day except on bootleg albums. ("" Just Like That"", ""Under My Sun"", ""Every Good Man"", ""I'm Still Alive"", etc.....) One wonders just how much of a hand the members of ABBA really have in these repackaged things......"
5,Awesome CD....,"If you have to choose between ABBA cd's to get, choice #1 should be ""ABBA The Album"", and choice #2 is this one...Both 5 Starz!"
5,does what it's supposed to do,"it's a case. it's meant for the 13"" MacBook. it just works. the inside has a soft ""furry"" kind of lining, which helps to prevent any case scratching.nice product. does what it's supposed to do."
5,Vang returns!,"Genre of hardcore horror/SF is Rowley's strongest point, although others prefer BattleDragons books. The Battlemaster make you think about scale of Universe, about ancient wars between stars and planets whose distant echo now threaten Humanity by mortal danger. All because of the Vang, protoevil alien species, battle demigods once created huge space empire, but now dethroned and dispersed.Chris, are you sure that there're no more The Vang beings left around? I don't think so... Oh, god..."
5,Read them all!,"Make sure you start with Starhammer and The Vang:The military Form. It's an excellent series in my opinion. Hey Mr. Rowley, do you have another one for us?"
5,Audubon Roadrunner,"The item was delivered quickly, in good shape and was very satisfactory. Will order again in the near future as items are needed"
3,"Cute sheets, but priced too high for quality","These sheets are quite cute, I have to say. However, I wasn't impressed with the softness (they are rougher than most 200 thread count sheets), they are thinner than most sheets, and came out of the package with an extremely strong chemical-like odor. I had to wash them three times before the odor went away. Wish they were softer; hopefully they'll soften up with time."
2,Poor quality.,"This item although is cute, the quality is sub-standard. The elastic in the sheets is barely there. The sheets come off every day. If I had more of a selection of kids sheets in a queen size, I would have never purchased this item."
3,scratchie,Very cute but not soft at all. When my son got in bed he said these sheets are scratchie. They have been washed once but very stiff.
3,Cute but rough,These are very cute sheets but unreasonably expensive for such low quality. The fell like less than 100 thread count!
5,Love it,"I bought the double (full) size three years ago and its still going on strong now - tho the comforter is now looking a bit faded. My son loves it. I also got the curtains and some glow-in-the-dark planet and stickers. He shows his room off a lot to visitors, especially in the night. The sheets do get softer after a few washes (in response to other reviews)"
2,Cute but way too rough!,"The print on the sheets is adorable, but like the others have said, I have washed them 3+ times to get them softer and nothing worked. As a result, my son is using the fitted sheet only because the flat sheet was so uncomfortable! For the money I had expected something with a little better quality."
5,That other guy has got it wrong,This isn't a strategy guide at all. It is the original Fighting Fantasy Gamebook. Silly man. Check what you're reviewing before you post.
2,didn't like it,"i thought this was going tgo be for electronic musicians. THIS IS NOT! it is for people who want to make their own samples (libraries) from scratch. it didn't tell me SQUAT about using my computer as a sampler and synth (in real, modern terms). it is too generalized. i LOVED this same publisher's ABLETON LIVE 4 book . now THAT'S a cool book."
1,A bit too elitist,"Ms. DeMello spends too much time acting as her own apologist as she explains how she acquired ""insider"" status in the tattoo community while still remaining an impartial observer. One thing I found particularly objectionable in her book was her apparent opinion, insinuated several times, that only women with ""the body beautiful"" should get tattoos (much less display them in public -- horrors!) As a woman (liberated, one assumes), Ms. DeMello should know better. This is one book which is going to end up in a used bookstore rather than in my collection."
2,not what I expected,"Tattoo books usually have a lot of pictures in them - at least the ones I've seen do. This book, while written very nicely, didn't have many pictures, and the ones it did have are grainy and in black-and-white. The history of the tattoo community is interesting, though I would have liked to see a bit more on how tattooing evolved from ancient times to now, instead of just from the 80's to now."
5,Great model for a reasonable price.,"I added this limo to my collection of Presedential limos and do not regret it. It has a great black finish, no defects. Awesome detailing, etc. I feel this is the best of the Yat Ming Presedential series."
3,Primary Motives- A fine line between politic and acting,"Richard Jordan plays the title character who is not above using anything and anyone to enhance his chances to win an election. He has his eyes on political position and no matter what, makes it clear that this is what he wants. He uses family, friends, and campaign workers and believers to his advantage and even when things come out about him, used the press as much as they use him, to help him get elected. Portrayed by Richard Jordan, he is whiley, patient and manipulative. Well played by Richard Jordan. Judd Nelson is also believable as a campaign worker."
3,Limited Band Sizing,"The watch itself is nice. I really liked the streamlined style and the overall look. Unfortunately, the band can only be sized by adding or removing clasps - the links themselves cannot be removed. This makes for large size changes (you wouldn't think so, but it's true). In my case, the band fit either way too large or too tight - there was no in between. I was bummed to have to return it (and to eat the return cost)."
3,Face too small - I can't see it,"Sorry to report that my presbyopia prevents me from telling time with this watch. If you're under 35 this will probably be a lovely watch for you, but at my age... it was just way too tiny."
5,Great Watch,"I am more than pleased with the watch; it is elegant, can be worn for dressup or casual, and keeps time perfectly. I was able to take it to a department store to have a link removed for no charge. The price was amazing."
2,pretty but too small,"This is a very pretty watch and I loved the two tone coloring. However the dial is so small I could not read the numbers easily. I do wear reading glasses, but still need one with bigger numbers"
5,Ann Klein watch,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MPO6N0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title I loved this watch. Have bee looking for a while and this one was perfect and so was the price.
4,Decent CD from a legend who doesn't write for acceptance,"Brian May has been one of my personal favorites for many years. Ever since the break up of Queen, Brian has used his musical talent to expand the musical tastes of his listeners and fans. This recording is a testament to his many tastes and talents in the music industry."
4,Good but not his best!,"Now being a HUGE Brian May fan, i must say this is a fine piece of work for someone with such talent as Brian May. I must say, that his guitar playing is, as always, wonderful, spectacular!!!! etc etc. But I must say it isnt his best. Back To the light is a little better, on the other hand, then Another World. Though it is a good album, it is lacking! Brian May, may not posses huge singing skills sing like Freddie Mercury, but he can sure damn well play guitar! For die-hard Queen fans,like me, this is a treasure!From a fan..."
4,buen disco !!!,enrealidad los disco de brian soy muy buenos en especial por su musica aunque su voz no sea sorprendente pero es muy melodiosa . te recomiendo este disco !
3,Interesting,"Brian Mays second (real) album is an improvement over Back To The Light due to Brian May putting more intencity into his vocals and improving the strangly bland and ordinary songwriting of that album (for the most part anyway). His guitar playing is fine just like it normally is. Unfortunatly theres too many covers on this album. The best music artists are the ones who feature no or only a few covers on their albums. Yes, Roger Taylor did do a few covers but only 2 and only on one album out of four studio albums. Freddie Mercury never had any covers on either of his two albums. It helped them to be original and interesting. One of the covers All The Way From Memphis is pretty silly too. Unfortunatly Brian May still has not made a fully credible studio album like Roger and Freddie managed to do but atleast he came close. He gets points for trying."
5,"Oh, man, pure Rock&Roll...","What else can I say about one of the greatest R&R musicians of all times?. Brian May did it quiet well again. From the tremenduos ""Business"", and the mature and well done ""China Belle"", to the excellent version of Hendrix, ""One Rainy Whish"", the Another World album is a complete jewel from the begining to the end, full of Rock&Roll in a way, that in the latest days, we were not used to breath, touch, hear and enjoy."
4,Srauss Waltzes,These are old recordings that are well done but the newer renditions that I've heard are better when played on a surround sound system.
5,Great performances of favorite Strauss waltzes and polkas,Vienna born Willi Boskovsky -- and the great Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra of which he served as concertmaster for forty years -- thoroughly assimilated the essence of the delightful Viennese waltzes and polkas presented on this CD. This is beautiful music superbly conducted and played by people who understand and love it. Very highly recommended.
5,Must see documentary...entertaining and timely,"It has been said; ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing"". Even worse, is when good men lie about who they are and work for the opposition!Unfortunately it is unpopular in many circles to be homosexual. I understand that you may want to hide to further your career or your political agenda. But to actively work against yourself and your rights is masochistic. If nothing else, I think the movie Outrage will educate all of us as to how self-hatred is belittling to the individual and harmful to society at large.I love a good documentary. This one is definitely good, and definitely worth seeing!"
5,Eye Opener!,"This documentary really opened my eyes to what is happening in Washington DC. I had heard for years about a large number of closeted homosexuals within the Republican Party. When Larry Craig was arrested for soliciting toilet sex, it came as no surprise. But this documentary really shines a light on more of these hypocrites. Very well done and the facts are meticulously backed up. Must see!"
5,don't sleep on devin,"devin been around 4 a minute member of the odd squad, and face mob and did numerous cvameos on rap a lot cd's over the years and this one is tight as hell good ... beats some hyped some laid back i would get this keep that underground flavor alive."
4,"Superb, despite lacking ""After the Lovin'""","Every track on this disc is essential Engy, if only it had After The Lovin' it would be perfect (that song was released years after this compilation, so it isn't entirely the record label's fault.) If you like the man, go for this collection over the others! It has the best collection of his early hits. You probably won't find one that has ALL the great hits, you may have to buy two. (Or, get the Rhino Have A Nice Day disc with After the Lovin on it.)"
5,E's Greatest Hits CD,"Merchandise came as promised, in good condition and I received what I expected to receive. Am pleased with my purchase."
4,Engelbert Delivers,"I'm not a huge Engelbert fan, but listened to some of his songs growing up. I only wish this greatest hits collection included ""After the Lovin'."" It does include most of his most popular songs and it's easy to see why he was a Vegas favorite even if he and his more popular contemporary, Tom Jones, both copied Elvis' Vegas persona a tad. Needless to say, he hits the high notes with incredible ease and sustains them. All these songs are first rate, and I think he earns a spot at the top with the great popular vocalists of the last 45 years."
1,Not good,I am very DIS-Satisfied wit this product. I used it only once and the lid is cracked. I can't use it.
2,good idea....poorly made,this is a great idea.It worked great for 3 weeks.Then it started leaking out of the base where the cup attaches to the motor.I like the item and am going to look for another one but the seal on the bottom should be rethought.
2,Don't waste your money!,Works great with plain water but as soon as soon as you add powder it is not strong enough to mix. Don't waste your money. I kept for my granddaughter to use for koolaid. I hope it will mix that. Not for protein drinks.Twistir / Power Mixer battery operated personal drink mixer
1,Not valuable item,"I've purchased this item in the hopes to mix a herb with juices and stuff. This item has leaks, flaw design, and a terrible motor that shakes the counter/table. I'd DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!"
5,Love it! works great. Item got here fast too.,Item arrived on time. It works great. The motors in them eventually start to wear out but other than that they work really well.
3,Cute but not for long...,I don't want to bash this product because I love it at the same time but the truth is that it doesn't take much for the chain to tarnish. The charm is still in good shape but after 3 times of wearing it I now have to buy a new chain or buy tarnish remover. Other than that it's very pretty.
5,First time order,"I received my medal in 3 days. It was shipped beautifully, wrapped in a cotton filled box, in a plastic bag in a mailing envelope. The medal was all I hoped it would be. This is the first time I ever ordered at Amazon and would order from Sabrina Silver always."
3,rot or burn?,"When I bought this product, I thought all I had to do was drill some holes and pour in the product. Now I find that I also have to pour diesel on and burn the stump, which is not practical in a lot of cases close to buildings, etc."
5,Very good,This is very good and easy to use .I recommend it to all those who like efficient products to work with.
4,Biased But Well Reserched Political Biography,"As a lifelong resident of New York City who came of age during the Giuliani years, i found this book very interesting. I was particularly impressed with Barrett's research into Giuliani's family history and his pre-mayoral career. The chapters on his '89 and '93 races for mayor were also interesting. a chapter dedicated to crime statistics seemed mundane but i guess was part of Barretts quest to give as much data to support his claims against Giuliani's success in bringing down crime. Most biographies have a level of bias, this one does have a high level of bias against Giuliani. it was still great reading and a good account on a portion of new york city history."
1,A tremendous waste of time...,"It amazes me that Barrett even got this thing published. He admits, early on, that he's ""anti-Rudy"". He not only insults Rudy, but the entire country of Italy.Go have a root canal instead of reading this, you'll be glad you did."
1,A waste of money!,Don't waste your money on this product. Not enough info. Just do a google on emu oil.
5,A Great Book!!!,"I can't say too many good things about this excellent book on fluid mechanics. My first course in fluids used this book and -- at first -- it seemed very challenging. But I soon discovered that the book's explanations of physical concepts are extremely clear and everything fell in place. I am really happy Wilcox has done a third edition and I have already bought a copy for use in my job. In fact, I like his writing so much that I think I own just about everything he has written. Thank you Dr. Wilcox for your careful attention to detail."
1,Definitely not an introductory text,"This was, without doubt, the single worst text book I have ever had the misfortune to read. As an introductory text to fluid mechanics it fails dismally. Explanations are poor and excessively theoretical. Examples are few, far between, and absurdly simple. The accompanying ""study guide"" was a fine joke on all of those foolish enough to purchase it. The only way this text could possibly be useful would be as a reference manual to someone who already knows enough about fluid mechanics to translate Wilcox's esoteric ramblings. If you are looking for an introductory text to the subject, then for love of your sanity, find something else."
3,Not an Introductory Text,"The text is mathematically rigorous, making extensive use of vector calculus and multiple integrals. If you are looking for an introductory text for civil engineering applications (i.e. one-dimensional, steady flow for the most part), Wilcox's book is inappropriate. I don't mean to sound critical, but the reviews stressing the books clarity can only have been written by guys with geek packs and thick, black-frame glasses."
1,Motherboard,Bought this motherboard from Tiger Direct. They sent the Delux board instead. Had to send it back and it cost me more than I was credited for on my card.
3,Interesting development.,"Most folks are aware of Fire because of their psychedelic pop classic ""My Father's Name Was Dad"". This is the only true LP they were able to complete before Dave Lambert joined Strawbs. The material here shows a link between the post-psychedelic rock of its time and the folk/progressive stance of Lambert's future band. The material is strong but lacks a distinctive voice. One other distraction is the narrative, which sounds like an uncle telling a fairy tale in a pub. On the plus side, the pretension meter registers on the low side. I would recommend this LP for fans of Thunderclap Newman, Fairport Convention and, of course, Strawbs."
4,exactly how it looks,THIS CASE IS GOOD. ITS SNAPS FINE TO A MOTO Q PHONE.GOOD BUY FOR PRICE.ITS KIND OFF SHINY AND BRIGHT.
5,Only History of Camp Lawton,"This book, edited by the Manager of Magnolia Springs State Park in Millen, Georgia, is a sort of compendium of the Confederate prison camp known as Camp Lawton. It includes a short history of the prison camp, a list of the known prisoners who died there (294 of the 685 are unknown) along with their state and regiment number and five pages of illustrations. The main portion of the book consists of reminiscences of prisoners who were actually captive at Camp Lawton (there are 13 of these). Camp Lawton was built to replace the better known Confederate prison at Andersonville. General John H. Winder, Commandant of all Confederate Prisons east of the Mississippi, made his headquarters there. After the war Captain D.W. Vowles, who was in charge of the Millen facility was charged with war crimes. He was never tried and disappeared from history. This is the only book ever published which deals exclusively with the little known Southern prison."
4,"A little gruesome, but overall well done","The key to liking this movie is two-fold. First, have a strong stomach. If you become ill over violence and gore very easily, do yourself a favor and skip this one. The second key is to not expect another Silence of the Lambs. This movie is NOT like SOTL at all. However, it still has it's strong points. It is suspenseful, has excellent action at times (opening sequence esp.), and actually does teach a few good moral values. One of which comes when Starling is suspended from the FBI for her involvement in a gunfight that cost several lives. Another good moral value comes in the end, but I'm not gonna ruin the ending. My only problem with this movie is that it was gory at times when there was no need for gore. However, the movie does a good job of developing the characters which helps to give this a 4 rating in my opinion. One word of caution: Imagine a cannibal on the streets. That is this movie."
4,"Very good, well worth your time","Let me say it first ""The book is better"". But if you judge this film on its own merits then it deserves 4 stars. This is a very good looking film. I love Ridley Scott films, his attention to detail and the way every scene is so well designed in this film is wonderful. Yes, the film is gory in spots but so is Harris' book.The only problem with the movie is that Scott did not spend more time revealing Hannibal's past, why he is so crazy, like in the book."
2,Way overrated,"I was very happy to see that they were making a sequel to the original. A movie that good needed a sequel, but the movie they came up with was very disappointing. I feel asleep almost 15 minutes into the movie because of the boredom. The whole movie was lead up to the big ending, which turned out to be not so big. The ending scene made my stomach turn, but I could have gotten the same effect by turning on the discovery channel and watching an operation. All in all I do not think that this movie was a good scene that had 2 hours of lead in."
3,Seen it all before...,"The ""final"" Lector movie focuses on Hannible living in Italy, where a greedy cop recognizes him and attempts to collect the reward for his capture. Watching this scenario play out, I got the impression I was supposed to sympathize with Hannibal Lector, not with the people trying to trap him. I would think that felons on the FBI's 10 most wanted list would be more recognizable in public, but Lector has no problem going through airport customs or mingling with Italian police. Julianne Moore's version of the Starling character was okay, but lacked the ""scared rabbit"" element Jodie Foster used so effectively in ""Silence"". Overall, this movie lacks the suspense and the tight scripting that made the first two stories to captivating."
2,Disgusting and an insult to the movies,"This is probably the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. All of this is throughout the movie and I can not believe that people paid to see this movie. I was anxious to see this, but never got around to it. once I rented it on DVD though, i was glad I didn't spend six bucks to see this movie. The end is the most disgusting thing I have seen in years. What saves this movie is the brilliant performance of Anthony Hopkins. He should be nominated for an Oscar. Julianne Moore is dry ans boring as Clarice. If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, rent this just to see another part of the story. Do not buy it though if you truly like it."
3,Jody Was Right,"Jody Foster was right in choosing to skip this misguided sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" ""Hannibal"" is Anthony Hopkins show and he remains delighfully twisted as the ultimate cannibal serial killer- but the plot is just an excuse for grotesque set pieces. In orde for us to sympathise which such a demented psycho we are given a more monstreous villain- a hediously disfigured child molestor who is obssessed with getting his revenge on the good Doctor Lecter- but this revenge is elaboratly preposterous-the entire film seems to be an attempt at classy Grand Guinol-but the results are gorgeously revolting- the final shocking dinner scene is simply silly."
2,"Wanted to like it, just didn't.","What is it about Ridley Scott movies that induce boredom? Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator, and now Hannibal all look great, but they are simply missing SOMETHING. Character development maybe? I'm not sure. Hopkins is great, though. He made the whole experience somewhat worthwhile. There are quite a bit of extras on the second disc, though, so if you are high on special features, this one may satisfy based on that alone."
3,What Happened?,"What happened to this movie? I hate to say this but the book was so much better. I do agree the scenery was beautiful and Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal superbly. Bravo! I was very disappointed that Mason Veger's sister's role was completly cut. In the book she and Barney (the nurse) are also daily people in Mason's life. Also cut was Jack Crawford, if he was there I missed him. The movie to me just took bits and pieces out of the book and was just to jumpy at times. All in all the movie wasn't bad but it really could have been better and most disappointing the the ending. The books ending was so much better. Read this great book to see what was cut from the movie!"
3,Going Up.... Going Up.... Going Up........ BAM!!! It's DOWN!,"I read Hannibal as soon as I could get a copy of it!! I loved every minute very page!! Then word comes of a film version!! OMG!! I am psyched!!!! Then, YAYYYYYYYY, it comes out!! I run to the movie and grab a seat!! I sit through the first hour and a half, entranced with the beautiful cinematography and the compelling story....then.... disaster strikes!! ( Spoiler Ahead ) When the agent's head was cut off people began to laugh, not only did the actor act funny, the effect looked cartoonish! It ruined the movie! Plus the ending was a tad different from the book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,over the top,"Last night I went to see the movie HANNIBAL. I thought that the first hour and 10 minutes or so was nothing short of brilliant. They captured the mood, and made you think that this would be a good movie. Then came the last 20 minutes or so... I dont want to give away too much, but there is a rather disturbing scene with some wild bores that may have well been left out, or maybe re-thought before included in the film. Then the infamouse (or soon to be infamouse) dinner scene was to the point of down right stupid. The last 20 minutes turned the legend of Hannibal into a ""goofy at best"" slasher flick. I mean to the point of movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The acting was awsome. I really feel that Anthony Hopkins did an excellent job, and so did the supporting cast. The filmography and camera shots where incredible. I also enjoyed the cleaver wit that was given to Hannibal. I would think that the wit might have also been the undoing of the film."
1,Bogus ending,"The production and performances were up to the excellent levels established in the Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon, right up to the moment when Lechter apparently amputated his own hand rather than give the cuff chain a few well placed whacks. This ending was so lame that the crew probably had to hold the author against his will: bound and gagged, and screaming while he was stuffed into the broom closet.The original ending in the book would have held the door slightly ajar for another awesome sequel.This ending so disgusted me that I threw the tape in the trash."
1,Sick? yes! But about what ?,Do you know what really makes me sick in this movie?... To see every minute on the screen the name of a famous Italian fashion designer. This is really where obscenity is in today Hollywood cinema.
2,Nothing To Sink Your Teeth Into,"I'm sure most people will agree with me that ""Silence of the Lambs"" was one of the greatest movies of all time. Be reassured, this movie was not! It was boring, all of the scenes just dragged on and on and on. What could've been a repeat of ""Scilence"" turned out to be a big flop. Ridley Scott amazes with ""Gladiator"", don't expect the same from this. What turned out to be a 2 hour 20 minute movie should've been about 50 minutes long. BORING! (The only thing that made me give it 2 stars were a few cool death scenes, in case you were wondering.)"
2,What's The Point ?,"This film should have never been made in the first place. It didn't take the plot of ""Silence of the Lambs"" any further. I would have really like to have seen Hannibal eat Clarice. It would have been a nice and tidy ending. It would have made the whole thing worth while. Instead they had to keep Clarice alive so that they could do another sequel. The whole film is just random acts of violence. It left something to be desired. The reason I gave this 2 stars and not 1 is because of the great acting. Oh and one more thing, if you liked this film, you really have bad taste."
1,Just awful,"One of the worst movies of the year and being a Thomas Harris fan, one of the worst adaptions ever made. Not even close to the level of Silence of the Lambs or Manhunter, totally ruined by a inferior script that strays far from the book. Would have been 10 times better if it remotly was closer to the book."
1,'Hannibal' stinks!,"In short-gore does not equal scary. Sadism does not equal terror. This film is virtually suspense-free (in contrast to the taut-as-a-piano wire suspense of 'Silence Of The Lambs'), and instead relies on geek-show theatrics to shock you instead of terrify you. I think 'Hannibal' stinks.P.S. The book isn't any better, either."
1,Why is there not a ZERO star rating???,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I am not sure what this movie had to do with the book, as there were very few similarities.DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE PIECE OF GARBAGE."
2,Very disappointing,"I was sorry to read that Jodie Foster had decided not to appear in the sequel to the classic ""Silence of the Lambs."" After having seen the film, my only question is: Why didn't Anthony Hopkins pass on it, too? Rarely has so much talent been wasted. The pacing was slow and the characterization was weak. Julianne Moore was fine as Clarice Starling, but the character was much too passive. Basically, all she did was get dumped on by her superiors while waiting around for Hannibal to show up. I'm one of those who enjoyed the book, and I'd like to read more about these characters. However, as far as film goes, I'll just be satisfied with ""Silence""."
3,IT IS BAD BUT GOOD!!,"I think that this movie, is no a movie you want to watch, with your little kids. This movie, has some very gross pictures in it! There is a scene that he opens a guys head and eats his brain!!! That is the worst one of all!! I like scary movies, but this is a SICK movie!! The begining of the movie is ok and i actually liked it for the most part until the end!!!!!"
2,Gore pornography...,"... and if you are into that sort of things, then knock yourself out. If instead you have been blessed with a well balanced psyche, have found this title on Netflix or Prime, and are excited at the idea of spending a night with a movie from Sir Ridley Scott, well, just don't. You are in for two hours of boredom, silliness and distaste. Just try to forget that he directed this one."
1,no film in the very damaged case,I received the DVD Hannibal and there was no film in the seriously damaged case. Only the second disc with the special features was in it.I am very disappointed.
3,Not the same,"The makers of this film did not to justice to either the book it is based on, or its theaterical precurser, Silence of the Lambs. Its difficult not to enjoy Anthony Hopkins in any role, and particullarly that of Hannibal Lecter, but this movie was not nearly as interesting as the first. Perhaps we were expecting Jodi Foster, and instead got Julianne Moore.The DVD itself offers several alternate endings, and I was really hoping one of them would validate the movie. Don't be fooled. They are merely reshootings of the current ending, with a word or two thrown in or neglected.I suggest you rent it before you buy it."
2,Hopkins shine's. Too bad story doesn't,"After watching this movie, all I can say is that Jodie Foster made a excellent decision to avoid this one. This is just a slasher movie dressed up with some big name stars and does not have any of the psychological terror of Silence of the Lambs.Bottom Line: Avoid this one like the plague."
4,Why change things?,"I first read the book - excellent. I was anxious to see the movie! It followed the book pretty well, but the ending is so totally different! Why change the endings like that? I much preferred the ending in the book. Other than that, it was overall a good movie. Don't plan on eating while you watch it! If you don't have a weak stomach, I'd recommend this movie."
4,Cordell!,"Man, I really enjoyed this movie, and I have to say that Gary Oldman is just perfect in this movie. No need to mention Anthony Hopkins and Giancarlo Gianinni who are also perfect in their roles. I did not like the idea of replacing Jodie Foster with... Julianne Moore, but I guess the movie is so good, I'll have to forgive this mistake. Miscasting? Moore tries so hard to look tough and honest that she fails terribly to the point of being unintentionally funny.But what's to say about this movie? Well, as we all know, Hannibal Lecter is free and hiding somewhere in Italy. But one of his victims, wealthy Mason Verger is planing an elaborate scheme to get his revenge: trapping Hannibal Lecter to watch him being eaten by wild animals.I have to say the music is excellent, cinematography... wow! It's a really elegant movie, superior in any way to its predecesor, The Silence of the Lambs. I highly recommend this one.Bon Apetit."
2,Boring! Stupid! And not bloody at all!,"Why did Italy want to cut some ""bloody"" scenes of this movie?! It's not brutal! Nearly NO blood! That Movie has NO Sense! The Story is brainless and the whole Movie is too long and soo boring! I really understand why Joodie Foster didn't want to put her talent into a Production as this one! This Picture shows us that Sequels are really bad! I was so excited to see that one but then I couldn't wait to go home! It ahs NO suspense!!!!"
1,Disappointing....,"After seeing Gladiator, I thought it was cool that someone was going to do another Roman movie. The Punnic Wars being one of the key battles for supremacy of the Mediterranean. Rome had one city standing in the way of its domination and that city was Carthage. There were three battles. One of the battles involved a Carthaginian general named Hannibal.This movie had me a bit confused as I was waiting for the climatic scene with the elephants crossing the Alps. Especially since parts of it were shot in Rome. Nor did I see any Centurions for that matter.Anyways, I didn't really care for this movie. It didn't seem like it had a plot other than trying to gross the heck out of the audience. Whatever."
1,Disgusting and Stupid,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I watch a lot of movies. My brother in law actually threw up while watching this movie. I don't understand the fascination with an evil serial killer, and I really don't understand how anyone could portray him as a sympathetic character, much less the savior of Clarice Starling."
2,Hannibal- Shmannibal,"first off they should of put Jodie Foster as Clarice StarlingI saw the first 2 movies and was overwhelmed. They were faboulous.I thought this movie was sick. It was all about the gore. The first two were supposed to be like nightmare scary all in your head and it was. But his movie was omg who was incharge of making this movie? It was horribal to watch especially the dinner scene.Also, it put shame on the previous movies, on what the movies made of the characters.All in all I watched the movie and spat. It was a bad name to the people involed in this movie.Ok storline, nice graphics, but all in all discusting."
1,oh please,"Just when I thought Silence of the Lambs was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen; they come out with a sequal that seemingly had an attempt to be humorous...what's with that? Audiences paid millions for this movie in the box office...the acting was good but it was, frankly, flat out dumb. Atleast the first one had depth."
1,Appalling,"The massive popularity of this repugnant film has revealed to me that society is deeply sick and there is no hope for it. That the average human being I pass on the street is in reality, underneath the flimsy cloak of civility, a closet sadist who takes pleasure in seeing others being mutilated. For all our belief that we are more progressive than our ancestors this is exposed to be a lie. The crowd sitting in the auditorium enjoying watching a man being disemboweled is no better than a crowd 500 years ago eagerly watching someone being burned at the stake, or hung-drawn-and-quartered."
4,Ugh,"I thought ""Silence of the Lambs"" did just fine all on it's own. This movie was great as far as suspense (the characters trying to keep one step ahead of a madman that is one step ahead of them). The ending disturbed me. It got to a point that I couldn't watch, I was so grossed out. At any rate, Anthony Hopkins is spectacular (of course). I didn't think Julianne Moore was too bad. Ray Liotta played, very well, the guy you love to hate. In general it's not a bad movie, but I don't think a sequel is really a sequel if the same leading actors aren't used for the main characters, Jodie Foster reallly should have came back as Clarice."
3,Sequel,"This stars Anthony Hopkins who reprises his role as Hannibal lector. He comes out of hiding to draw an FBI agent into battle. A decent sequel which features a grisly ending, worth a rent or two."
4,Tastes Just Like Chicken ;-)...,"Guten Abend Mein Herrin,I don't write spoilers. This is a very good movie, & a fine member of the SotL storyline. Really a nice expansion on the plot. One problem: Julianne Moore. I've nothing against her, but feel she let this film down badly. She simply didn't ""Bring it."" I thought Foster was snubbed for this role when it was released. In order to have the money to pay for Hopkins. I was wrong. She took a pass on it. IMHO, Ms.Moore barely acted @all in this. An unemotional Poker Face through most of the film. You get little or no sense of her turmoil, motivation, or pain. Looks like this is the last in the series, a fine job."
3,HE DID NOT CUT OF HIS OWN HAND!!! ARE YOU ALL THAT DAFT?!?!?!,"I was really enjoying this movie until the final ""climactic"" scene between Clarice and the good doctor. David Mamet and Steve Zaillion were absolutely arrogant in changing the ending that Hannibal's creator, Thomas Harris, wrote in HIS book. It is an insult to the character to have him cut off his own hand when, in the book, he just keeps Clarice as his ""companion"" forever. The alternate ending is a bit more palatable (pun most definitely intended) but still... HE DID NOT CUT OFF HIS OWN HAND!!! To quote Otto from ""A Fish Called Wanda""... DISAPPOINTED!!!"
2,Foul.,"Hannibal starring Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore is a disgusting sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as Clarice Starling, she sure made the right decision! Moore is awkward as Starling, she has a hard time tackling the accent. Hopkins is still creepy but that scene with the pigs is so vile, I covered my eyes, ugh! Horrible movie, Red Dragon is better than this."
3,Disappointing extras,"While I enjoyed the movie, the way the ""cut"" scenes were presented was a disappointment. They were not included in the movie where they should have been, but instead were placed in a separate section. Sometimes it was difficult to tell where they actually would have been in the movie."
2,Snore!!!,"I purchased Hannible the same time I picked up The Silence of The Lambs Special Edition, because of the ""Save ... when you purchase both movies"" coupon on the covers. Having not seen Hannibal previous to my purchase, I thought,""What the hell...I'll save a couple bucks."" I could have saved the entire purchase price and rented this piece of junk. Though, it picks up where ""Silence"", left off, Jodi Foster isn't in it, and the plot seems dorky. Way too ... for such a dull movie. If you enjoyed ""Silence"", get it...but don't waste your time or money on this one. Rent it first, then decide whether you really want to add this ... to your collection. Anyone wanna buy a copy?"
3,OK - but not chilling enough,"In ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", Dr Lecter was way morechilling and scary. Here he is just an invinciblebogey man. Where is his erudition?Shucks! Must have left it in Italy - at the lecture.Of course I am a fan of the ending of the book, so Iwanted this movie to be better.Julianne Moore gives a very creditable performance asStarling. There was nothing here ( unlike the book ) tomake Jodie Foster shy away from playing Clarice again.Now let us see if Mr Harris writes another book how themovie makers can reconcile it to the completely botchedending of the movie.The chemistry between Lecter and Starling from the first movieis completely lacking. But it does seem to have beentransferred to the scene at the opera between Lecter and Passi'swife. You could imagine him killing Passi for being an ignorantboor. I cannot imagine him killing his wife - so the line thatbegins ""I was was thinking of......"" now only has one possibleinterpretation."
3,The Silence of The Lambs 2: The Revenge of Hannibal Lecter,"The sequel wasn't so great. Ten Years after Clarice Starling killed Buffalo Bill, Clarice(Now played by Julianne Moore) forgets about Dr. Lecter(Anthony Hopkins), until one day she recieves a letter from the evil doctor. He writes that he is enjoying his days in Rome, Italy, where Clarice searches for him. There was a little bit two much gore in this movie(Lecter killing the Inspecter, Lecter removing the top of Ray Liotta's head) but this movie was ok. Red Dragon did really good though."
2,"If you can do that, why is William Holden dead?","I really did not enjoy HANNIBAL. In my opinion, it's a cliché masquerading as an ""intelligent"" film. I hate that! I blame David Mamet, who accidentally made one good film in his career.I found the ""gross"" scenes ridiculous. If you're so rushed that an amputation is necessary, do you really have time to pack lunch?Watch it if you must, but SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is a much better film."
4,Great Sequel,"Anthony Hopkins exudes creepyness in this sequel. While not superior to Lambs in the storyline department, it's better directed. Ridley Scott really knows how to direct a flick. Julianne Moore's Clarice is good. The story is good but it's Hopkins show, he moves his character from villan to anti-hero."
2,A good movie?,"Okay, granted the movie did help with scenes that contained gore, but if you really want the effect the story is trying to send people, read the book. The movie completely destroyed the ending. The purpose of Clarice and Hannibal's relationship in Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal is ripped away from you in this movie. How can Ridley Scott just destroy Thomas Harris's vision?"
4,Enjoy It for what it is.,"I was a little disappointed with the movie adaptation of the book. I think they left out some very crucial elements from the book that should have been left in the movie. Despite the poor adaptation from the book I still really enjoyed the movie alot. This movies is not Silence of the Lambs and in now way does it pretend to be. This movies has a whole different style story to tell. I think the first movie was more Good v.s. Evil where in Hannibal all the characters other than Agent Starling are all evil in their own ways. I thought the movie was very enjoyable. I would give it 5 stars if I had not read the book, but only 3 to 4 since I read the book first. The movie is good by itself but the book was far superior."
2,This is nuts,No I take that back it wasn't nuts it was flipping crazy!! Now I love Silence of the Lambs but this was just God-awful WAY too violent and just flat out gross. This movie releyed on Anthoney's canabalism to scare the [heck] out of you. Slience of the Lambs was much more suspenseful from a psychological stanpoint. If you have any respect at all for the first movie aviod this just terrible sequel.
1,Just as bad as the book,"This story was terrible. I guess the movie was OK for what it had to work with, but if you're a Silence of the Lambs fan, you're sure to be disappointed. I didn't like Julianna Moore as agent Sterling, and I can clearly understand why Jody Foster declined the role. One shining star was Anthony Hopkins who brought Lector back to life.But plain and simple, don't waste your time."
2,it could have been great,"its a shame with all the talent making this movie , that it fell apart so fast , there were to many scenes that didnt really seem to connect well , to many subplots going on that didnt seem to come to satisfying conclusions . the ending was all wrong . to bad it could have been great"
4,Great product!,"The movie was a little damage in the box, but anyway was awesome, definetely i will buy more later and i recived at time!!!"
3,Anthony Hopkins was good!,"I think I need to stop reading books then expecting Hollywoodto do something good when they make a movie. They did a pretty good job with the special effects of the boars, Mason Verger's face and Paul Krendler getting his skull opened up. Anthony Hopkins was his usual top notch self and Julianne Moore did what she could with the part; would have loved Jodi Foster reprising it though.What bothered me most was the ending; it's not at ALL how it ended in thebook! In fact, I would have rather had the book end the way the moviedid with Clarice being freed and Lecter fleeing again. Also, because the character Margo wasn't in the movie, we didn't get to see how Mason really got it!It's a decent movie, just not a great one. Worth watching? Sure, why not."
4,Keep the title in mind...,"when you watch this movie, and you'll understand it. I loved Hannibal...and had several friends who hated it, because they expected a true SOTL sequel. If you understand that Hannibal is from the viewpoint of Lector, and the imagry is lush and refined, much like Hannibal would demand. If you think you are getting a by the book sequel, you will be dissapointed. If you think you are getting a look into the mind of one of the most intriquing characters created in the 20th century, you will NOT be dissapointed."
3,"Not as great as the original, but what sequal is?",This is just what a sequel does after the original movie comes out and does so well. I saw this here in town and I can honestly say this is not up to par. Hopkins should have known what Foster did and turned this down. The ending is a waste of everyone's talent! The beginning was good.
2,Anthony Hopkins! Why do you do this to me!?,"I love Anthony Hopkins in this movie, so that's why it got 2 stars. I love the way that man talks. And Juliane Moore is a really good actress. But eating a brain? Come on. That's the only reason I went to go see it, sadly. I mean, who didn't go just to see that particular scene? It was a movie made for gore and to bore me to death. The brain thing really wasn't even that gross. Why Anthony Hopkins?! WHY?!"
3,Corrections for fra7299,"Hey, just a few minor corrections :). Hannible is part 3. Check out the Thomas Harris novels: Red Dragon (Made once as Manhunter, will be out this fall w/Hopkins as Lector.), The Silence of the Lambs, and Hannible. Only the last two feature Clarice Starling, the first revolves around Will Graham."
2,"Hello Clarise...yeah, yeah, yeah","This is the reason that they should leave originals alone. I actually thought this movie was rediculous. Anthony Hopkins again finds a way to escape and inflict more damage on society. I just find it silly how killers find these amazing ways to escape from the law in these kind of movies, kind of like a deranged Houdini on the loose. This time he's in Italy. Then he is in someone's room slicing them up. Then he is eating someone's brain for breakfast. Would you like eggs with that, Hannibal? And enough with the ""Hello Clarise..."".....haha..very funny. I got it the first time in the original. Please somebody, get this character and lock him up for good so there isn't a Part 3."
1,Too Nasty!,Hannibal Dr. Cannibal. I can't believe anyone can sit through this movie. It's too sickening. I've seen horror films that are equally disturbing without Cannibalism. All I can say is the film will most certainly convert meat lovers into vegetarians. My Advice steer clear if you're too sensitive and faint hearted!
2,Could have been....,"This movie could have been the best movie of the new year. Instead we get a very long, borning opening that I must admit, I fell asleep in. Hannibal doesn't kill anyone until one hour and fifteen minutes into the movie. And no matter what anyone tells you, the movie does not have that much gore. I have seen a lot worse. I didn't really care about the killing, but there really is no suspense at all. I didn't care what hannibal was doing in Italy or what C. Starling was doing. When I saw the preview I thought the whole movie was going to be a ""catch me if you can"" movie. It wasn't that at all. The best part of the movie is the ending, which had the most gore. Anyhow, I thought Ridley Scott would have done a much better job. I like all of Scott's previous flims a lot more."
4,Hannibal Gets Revenge,"When Silence of the Lambs was released in '91 and then went on to win Best Picture, we all knew a sequel was coming (we just didn't know it would take Thomas Harris 7 years to write it). And finally Hannibal is here, a film which takes us into Lecter's life after he has escaped from prison. He obviously has lived a life of exquisite taste, enjoying beautiful Florence, Italy. But back home Clarice gets into trouble and one of Lecter's victim's (the only one left alive) concocts a plan to capture Lecter. But also Clarice is framed by a fellow officer, but Hannibal really shows him when he gets his just desserts!!! Great performances by Hopkins and Moore, once you get into the film you don't even miss Jodie Foster! The direction by Ridley Scott is fantastic, as good as Gladiator with some fast cut-scenes and the soundtrack is a fabulous Hans Zimmer encore!"
2,Read the Book,"What I will never understand is why this movie is named Hannibal and yet Scott totally omits the memories of Hannibal's childhood. That was so central to his relationship with Clarice I cannot comprehend it's exclusion. Also, was it me or did I see the boom mike enter into the picture from the top of the screen a few times? Not a very good adaption. Silence of the Lambs was so good because basically there wasn't a thing changed from Harris' book"
4,Ridley Scott you did it again!,"It is truly an amazing film. Forget the sequal... to me this one is much better than the first! This movie drives you through a master piece of suspense and thriller.The make up was brillaint and thrilling for the ""deformed man""! Anthony Hopkins played his role well but the big credit I give to Ridley Scott!The two things that got me not to rate it 5 stars was:1. The story did not cover how did Dr. Lecter manage to do everything (job, escape, travel ..etc.) without any assistance!2. The scene at the dining table at the end of the film was a bit over exaggerated!Other than that, it was a movie not to be missed!"
1,"Wheres Anthony Hopkins, Coz i want my money back","My now, wife paid for me to get into this movie, and am i glad? This film urinates on the grave of silence of the lambs. The plot was slow moving( at one stage my wife nodded off) i myself was trying to see how many pieces of popcorn i could throw at Anthony Hopkins. The one piece of enjoyment i obtained from the film itself is the amount of abuse it warrented on the way home. Hell hath no fury than 6 film go-ers scorned. DONT WASTE YOUR CASH!!!!"
1,WASTE OF TIME!!!,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM! If I could give it less stars, I would. First, I absolutely love, LOVE, ""Silence of the Lambs"". It is an all-time classic. ""Hannibal"", is a weak excuse for a sequal. Hopkins and Moore were great in the parts they were given, but the suspence that made the first film so great is completely absent in this one. ""Silence"" was a big movie that felt like a wonderful small film. It was artistic, enthralling, and spine-tingling. ""Hannibal"" is predictable, boring, and laughable. I know we live in the age of actions movies, digital audio, and two hour music videos, but come on. Ridley Scott should not have been allowed within 1,000 miles of this story."
2,Does not live up to the original,"Silence of the Lambs was a critically acclaimed success- a compelling, suspenseful, moving movie. What does the movie studio do? Try to duplicate the success as quickly as possible to strike while the iron is hot, and create a sequel. And like most sequels, this movie doesn't live up to the original.Even veteran actor Anthony Hopkins cannot save this movie, in spite of his wonderful performance. Julianne Moore replaces Jodi Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling, who squares off against Dr. Hannibal, who taunts her from across the Atlantic ocean in obscure ways.I can almost imagine how the script outline took shape. The story seems to be the product of anxious Hollywood pitchmen frantically throwing out ideas to a studio executive, grasping for success. In any event, they have produced a disjointedly contrived story, punctuated with brief scenes of gory violence.If you must see this movie, rent it.. don't buy it."
3,More like 3 1/2 STARS,"While it was thrilling and exciting like the first, it wasn't all that I thought it could have been. Some parts just didn't seem as scary, but it was good enough that I bought it. The DVD also gives an alternate ending."
2,If they ever make a 3rd one,"I hope it is smarter then this. I saw this movie in the theater. Once was enough for me. I don't think I will bother with the best selling book eather. I loved ""The Silence of the Lambs"", but ""Hannibal just seemed like one big horror cliche to me. Throwing lots of blood at a movie that's just for shock value is a good example. I also thought film sufferd form script rot. There lots of cheesey lines in ""Hannibal"".I was also let down by ""Manhunter"". The movie that the ""Silence of the Lambs"" was remade by. Everyone thought it and the book ""Red Drogon"" was great."
1,NoT GooD.,"I thought this movie was Stupid.And then I felt Stupid for Watching it through to the end.If you want to see a good movie...Watch: ""Silence of the Lambs"".DO NOT WATCH THIS RIDICULOUS SEQUEL...!"
3,They should make the trilogy,"The script of this movie will make you keep saying: "" what the ----'s she doing"" cause she keep trying to save him that made her really stupid in handling a cannibal who is listed on ""fbi's top 10 most wanted"" don't you think so? the city sets are really nice on the screen, directing stuff is great too, but i there's something that doesnt make sense too about why there wasnt any blood drip from ray's head meanwhile hannibal already cut the forehead and only covered it with a hat??? btw this is quite a shocking & gory movie, and they should make the trilogy with different cool setting, and probably they both should fall in love each other? -lol-"
2,"If you want the REAL story of Lecter, read the book","I was very dissappointed in this movie. I mean, it was well done, but totally butchers the incredible book. It is very different and leaves the ending wide open, where in the book we are shocked as to the way it ends, which is very different than this movie mind you. I just think that if you want to really keep up on the Lecter Trillogy, then you should read the book to help you. This movie will mess everything up. Just rent it, dont buy it."
2,"I blame this on ""Itchy and Scratchy""","How bad is this movie? Well the opening shootout gives us our first glimpse. The ""crying"" scene by Julianne Moore is so bad you feel embarassed watching it. Hannibal's ability to overtake people is laugable and just too unbelievable. You know all along it's just to advance the script in that direction. And as to the ending, I squirmed initially, but was not grossed out. I did have a good laugh on retrospect after realizing it was straight out of an epsiode of ""Itchy and Scratchy."""
1,This Movie was just [yucky0,"I have to admit that Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are 2 of the best actors out there! But this movie was the worse movie...I would never want to see it again! I admit there was some good acting but...[yuck]! I wouldnt recommend it to anyone! Red Dragon and Scilence of the lambs though, that is a different story"
1,Watching this is like talking to someone with bad breath!,"Man, it's just AWFUL. The B-movie ""head"" scene alone will have fans of ""The Toxic Avenger"" shouting, ""Bravo!"" Imagine this sequel to Silence of the Lambs being like having a pina-colada wine cooler after a glass of $150 Merlot. Those that don't know the difference have their head in the sand. Refrain from wasting your time or money on ""Hannibal."""
1,Jodie Foster Must Have Read The Screenplay!,"We have only the word of the opening credits that talented people like Steve Zaillian, David Mamet and Ridley Scott were involved in this witless, mostly boring and stupidly gory sequel to ""Silence Of The Lambs.""The 2 disc DVD package is nicely produced and includes a documentary called ""Breaking the Silence,"" interviews with cast and crew and a series of deleted scenes.Everyone involved would have been better off if the entire film was deleted."
2,Oh Please....Read the book!,This movie was terrible. I nearly walked out of the theatre before it ended. Most notable in many scenes was the descending boom mic that nearly hit the actors on the head and was never edited out....took me right out of the movie and made me laugh at the amateurishness of it. I would have given this one star except for the acting of Sir Anthony. He is a true actor but I was a little surprised that he took this role.Silence of the Lambs was a psycological thriller --- it toyed with your mind and left much to our own horrific imaginations. This left nothing. You knew exactly what was going to happen before it happened (even if you hadn't read the book). It was all shoot 'em up action and gore with very little thought. Don't waste your time watching it(I wonder if the boom mic will get nominated for any awards for so much screen time?)
1,Not a sequel,"Don't waste your money on this film. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, what Red Dragon, not Hannibal."
1,Awful..,I read the book - this junk bore little resemblance. The poor treatment of the subject matter made the tense scenarios that thrilled me in the book into laughably vague and sometimes unbelieveble scenes in the movie. And our dear Mr. Hopkins played it a bit too sinister this time around. Would Dr. Lecter behave so obviously when he was trying to evade capture?? Disappointing.
4,Hannibal,"Anthony Hopkins does it once again! As always he's wonderful in this film. Julianne Moore is exceptional and does a good job as Agent Starling.The only thing I did't like about the DVD is this ~ ""The Director's"" cut out things that should have been left in the film. On the second DVD (that comes in this package) you will see the snip's that were left out of the film. They should for the most part have been left in the film and the DVD shoud be re-done and put back! Those snips matter to this film.If I had to watch it for the first time again, I think I'd look at the second DVD first then watch the ""movie"".All in all, it's a keeper."
2,Ray Liotta should have had his head examined!,"Just rented this one today - just goes to show you can't improve on perfection. As usual, they should leave well enough alone, but of course Hollywood could never do that! I would have to agree with a number of other reviewers who mention ""parody"" in several scenes. The climactic ""dinner"" scene near the end was absolutely laughable! Good maybe for a rent, just don't buy it."
3,German import,"This is the German release of Ridley Scott's HANNIBAL. Things you should know about this disc: The menu is in German and the default language is German (although the English track is available). The movie and the menu will play on a U.S. model PS3, but the extras will not, as they are PAL format. The picture quality is an improvement over the DVD, but it's not on par with the best Blu-ray titles. Unfortunately, DNR (digital noise reduction) has been applied, which often gives faces a waxy look. This is likely the same transfer that was used for the DVD, but in HD this time. No HD audio is included, but the DD 5.1 English track sounds fine. Bottom line: This is only for fans of the movie who can't wait for the U.S. release."
4,Anthony Hopkins 's best film!,"I appreciate Hannibal story and movie.You never get bored but it's sometimes very disgusting!The actor act well particularly Anthony Hopkins, It surely hard to interpret a cannibal !!I prefer Jodie foster than Julian Moore in the role of Clarice sterling but Moore acts well too.It's hard to understand why some people eat humans, it's very disgusting.Even if Hannibal is very mad, he is attaching, you don't think he's mad.I suggest you to watch it but don't eat before!"
1,bad movie,"Extremely disappointed in this one!! I almost wish I had not wasted my money and bought it. Very slow and boring story line, no suspense at all. Thought the first movie was much better. Actually had to slap myself from falling asleep during this one!! If you really have to see it rent it first, not worth the money to buy!"
1,Absolutely horrible,"If you have been looking forward to this film because you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, then you will be very disappointed. If you have looking forward to this film because you enjoyed the book, then you will be very disappointed. If you have been looking forward to this film for any other reason, then you will still be very disappointed. Julianne Moore's acting is terrible and it looked to me like they tried to make the extra gory so that the audience would focus on the gore instead of the fact that this film lacked a story."
4,IGNORE THE CRITICS.....HANNIBAL IS GOOD,"I cant see why people are slagging off hannibal so much.OK so it is not going to be as good as the silence of the lambs,but it never could.There is still fun to be had in Anthony Hopkin's darkly comic performance and gary oldman gives a first rate performance as the twisted Mason Verger.The film is beautifully shot and Florence is an ideal Lecter hiding place (remember the line in silence of the lambs .."" Do you know florence?"")and the 2 disc set contains lots of features as well as a great transfer of audio and video.Don't take my word for it though,rent it first and decide for yourself."
2,What happened to Hannibal?,"The movie it's self is alright but what happened to the characters. I recommend watching it once but only once. It is untrue to both Hannibal and Clarice. That has nothing to do with the actors; it is what they were given to work with. I love Silence of the Lambs, especially Lecter's character in it, and watching Hannibal it didn't seem like the same guy.(If you have seen this and like it, the DVD is good and has a very nice making of feature.)"
2,"MONEY, MONEY, YUMMY, YUMMY","WHEN I FIRST HEARD THAT DIRECTOR RIDLEY SCOTT WAS INVOLVED IN THE SEQUEL TO THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A RAW THRILLING PIECE OF CINEMATIC HISTORY. I SAT PATIENTLY IN MY CINEMA CHAIR, GROWING MORE AND MORE RESTLESS. IT WAS WHEN THE INFAMOUSE END SEQUENCE ARRIVED THAT I ACTUALLY TURNED TO THE PERSON SAT BESIDE ME AND ASKED ""IS THIS A JOKE?"" I FELT LIKE I WAS ON A NEW HIDDEN CAMERA SHOW AND THE FILM I WAS WATCHING WAS A GOFFY SETUP. SADLY, THE MOVIE WAS INDEED NOT A SETUP AND THIS WAS WHAT FANS HAD BEEN THROWN AFTER A VERY PROMISING BUILDUP. FOR ANYONE WHO CLAIMS HANNIBAL IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION; IF HANNIBAL LECTER IS SUCH AN INTELLIGENT MADMAN, SURELY HE WOULD KNOW TO GET OUT OF HANDCUFFS ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS CHOP OFF HIS THUMB AND NOT HIS WHOLE HAND. EVEN THE DUMBEST CRIMINALS KNOW THAT!!! LUCKILY RED DRAGON REDEFINED THE WORDS INTELLIGENCE AND SUSPENSE AND GAVE AUDIENCES THE PROPER ENTERTAINMENT THEY DESERVE."
2,Gross AND dull!,"It's hard to be both stomach churning and boring at the same time but this film manages to find a way. ""Hannibal"" has three of the goriest Grand Ginioul moments in any splatter film: Mr. Lecter hangs & disembowels an Italian detective at the same time; some hungry worthogs dine on another group of villans (leaving nothing to the imagination); Hannabal feeds an FBI agent his own brains! However, you have a long forgettible ride before you get to any of that. Hardcore HG Lewis fans are going to use the fatfoward button a lot. The rest of use should just stick with ""Manhunter"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""."
5,What a gripping movie,"I had heard mixed reviews about this movie however i same from the cinema transfixed by the horrific scenes produced and the acting very very good, a must to own! dont invite your friends for a chinese though to watch it!"
3,The Violence in this film was truly tasteless.,"Not to mention it left out a very important element. In the book Hannibal it explains why Hannibal was so nice to Clarice and why he refused to kill her. The movie left that major element out of the book. Not to mention, the violence in the film was completely tasteless in my opinion. It's hard to give a critique of this movie since I can't see past all of the violence. Apart from my negative criticisms of this movie the film held true to the book."
4,At least we can see the touch of Ridley Scott,"The caracteres in this movie are decadent, degenerate, Mason Verger ( Gary Oldman ) is one of the most horrendus villans in movie history, his voice, his makeup are memorable, and the movie follows the book and I think is fine, even the change on the end works, because the people in the theater was at one step to laught and if Jodie Foster join to the dinner that will be excesive, the athmosphere created by Scott is morbid, sick, specially the first part of the movie so I think he does a good job, we know that he is a great steticist and this movie has to work in the commercial way, so Im not expected a masterpiece like Alien, or Blade Runner, because of that, I buy this movie, is worth for the photography and elegant production design, and still expecting the release in DVD of 1492 Conquest of Paradise ( with the unforgettable music by Vangelis ) and The Duellist another great movies by Ridley Scott."
4,Excellent movie but......,"This movie was excellent all the way around. I had never seen Silence of the Lambs before this but after seeing this movie I went out and got the movie. I love both of them!The only thing I found wrong with this movie is the ending in the kitchen. Just seeing the first movie, I wish this one hadn't ended the way it did with Lecter and Clarice coming together.This movie is a great movie overall and I highly recommend it to everyone. At time's it is funny and at others it's down right horrific. This movie will offer something for everyone!"
4,Should have stuck with the original ending...,"I'm not going to go into what the original book ending was to Hannibal, but the ending chosen for the movie was a copout. As for the movie, that would be my only complaint. Moore held her own in a role that doesn't call for much depth an insight, as this is Hopkins' show. One of the real bright spots is of course Gary Oldman as the main antagonist Mason Verger. The makeup is fantastic and his sadistic portrayal of the character is dead on perfect. All in all, better than Manhunter but a notch below SOTL. If you are going in expecting Silence of the Lambs Part Two, you will be disappointed. Hannibal is on the loose and the psychological interplay he had with Clarice in the first film won't work as well here as action does. A fun film with a very funny, but disappointing, take on the ending"
1,Hannibal Is The Worst Sequel Ever Made Since Halloween III,"Hannibal, the sequel to Manhunter and The Silence Of The Lambs, is by far the most disapointing movie ever. The ending was the worst part of the movie. I don't want to ruin it for you, but those who read the book will be disappointed. Now, don't get me wrong. I like Juilianne Moore. But, when you think of Clarice you think of Jodie Foster. It also ditches the psychological horror theme and goes for the more noir meets Italian Drama. It has a few wierd parts in it, but it was nothing like The Silence Of The Lambs. I suggest if you watched the first two, then you may want to rent the sequel. Othereise, save your money for the remake of The Red Dragon."
4,Too overpowering,"This is an extremely well done thriller. The acting is superb. The story is fresh. Well, as fresh as a sequel can be. My only problem with the film is that they really pushed the edge with the gore in this movie. You definitely do not want your children to see this film. Some of my adult friends have had trouble with the scenes in this movie and I am sure children would have nightmares over it. I really liked the movie, but I wish they would have held back a bit."
2,You have got to be kidding me...,"This movie is definitely NOT at all a good book to movie transfer. There were SO many changes from the book, not to mention the fact that there was a new director with a completely different style which butchers the original feel of Hannibal's character. ""Hannibal"" did not ring true as an addition to this series. ""Red Dragon,"" the story which precedes ""Silence of the Lambs"" was awesome compared to this. The ending of Hannibal was just re-writen to please the American audiences who can't seem to deal with the outcome of the novel, I suspect. you have got to be kidding me..."
2,Hannibal; actors without a proper script,"Sequels are rarely better than the original (The Empire Strikes Back is an exception) but most often they are not this disappointing. What will let you down the most is the poor script; too many important scenes from the book have not been used, the final confrontation between dr. Lecter and Starling is ridiculous, it lacks refinement and there are simply too many one-liners that are simply not funny (even though some were obviously intended to be). Great actors (Hopkins, Oldman, Giannini and Liotta) but Moore does never convince as Starling. Jody Foster could not have saved this movie but she might have made it a bit less hard to swallow. Buying this movie is not the best way to spend 20+ dollars. Read the book or get Silence of the Lambs on DVD, in case you havn't got that yet."
1,Distasteful Garbage!,"I am ashamed to have seen such an antipathy of a motion picture. Was this film directed by Ridley Scott even with a try to produce? Aversion! Hannibal Lector (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is hiding in a reclusive location. Sweden? Italy? Don't know. I could care less. The movie moves at an excruciating slow pace and Clarice (played by Julianne Moore this time) seems stiff and moves around like cadaver). Ultra ennui! She has searched for Dr. Lector for many years and she should've has closed the case after ""The Silence of the Lambs"", a good movie. This movie is truly sickening with its amount of gruesomeness even Jason Voorhees would find lewd! The deformed man that wanted to get revenge on Dr. Lector was just extra malady! By the way, I don't want to get near a pig pen ever! After watching this freak show, I lost my appetite for the rest of the day and ended up not eating for a month. If this is your kind of playground, then by all means dig in! Distasteful, no yummy!"
2,Ha! A Sequel! To what?,"Well, if you have read the book, do not, I repeat, do not go see this movie. Yes, the actors did a lovely job. Of course they would. Anthony Hopkins is in this. But, the script strays from the original text, which is beautifully written. And on top of all that, the writer or writers, for I have forgotten who was the final writer, took out key scenes. Not once does the audience find out why Hannibal eats people; they had him, Hannibal, HIT Clarice. Never, in a million years, would Hannibal Lector hurt in any way the one thing in the world he truly cared for. Then, for those with weak stomachs, BABIES, do not see it, for someone gets eaten. What a surprise in a movie about Hannibal Lector. Anyway, see the movie so it gets sales, but do not expect to like it much if you have read the book. Otherwise, enjoy it."
2,Not what I'd recommend,"First of all, don't expect a good sequel. This movie is nothing like ""Silence of the Lambs"". The original was a very suspenseful psychological thriller, the duration of which you spent on the edge of your seat. This movie is average in the thriller-like category respect. As a matter of fact, everything about it is average, which might have gotten it 4 stars. However, the character of Hannibal is not the same person we met in the first movie. He's different, less interesting and original, more like a common criminal. So, we're down to three stars. However, the ending is Horrible. I can't emphasize it enough. It's sickening and disturbing. It's also gratuitous. I like horror movies, I've watched many films both physically and psychologically disturbing. But this went beyond it and seemed to have no point. Thus, I end up with a 2-point rating. Too bad, ""Silence"" could have had such a good sequel."
2,Pointless Sequel,"Waring, do not expect this movie to have the same deep impact that Silence of the Lambs had on its viewers. This movie will not make any top 100 list or win any awards. What it is, is another generic thriller just like a Kiss The Girls, or Along Came a Spider. It has an FBI Agent hunting down a wanted Serial Killer who does ""really Bad things."" If this movie had nothing to do with Silence of the Lambs, then no one would have gone to see it and word of mouth would have caused the movie to be pulled out of the theaters within a few weeks. If you want a gross out killer movie with a deeper plot, check out American Psycho, which is much better than this one.....D"
5,Excellent DVD,"I just bought the Dvd this morning and it's wonderful,it's packed with extras and neat little options,Regardless of what some may say about Hannibal it's the perfect movie about the Cannibal with culture and style."
3,Review about the DVD/Video release,"One wonders why the movie billed as ""The ending you'll never forget!"" on the box when it turns out that they cut a good minute or so out of the end. This is a disappointing detail about the home releases and almost makes the deleted scenes obselete. Why include extra scenes if you're going to cut the selling point of the movie?"
2,Hype Rules...and fools,"I am not going to compare this film to either of the others that have gone before because that would be the wrong thing to do. Taking it as a stand alone film, in which the principal player is one of the most sinister characters in movie murder history, it was just very poor. There was nothing particularly wrong with the acting, the sets, the direction or any aspect of production really, it was just a bad story. With the potential of weaving a superb tale around Hopkins excellent character, it instead turned into a total wasted oppotunity. I had actually read the book beforehand and thought that the story was poor. Unfortunatly, poor books translate into even poorer films. Don't beleive the hype, see it before you buy it. It is very likely you will save your money."
5,The Doctor is in.....,"When Hannibal was eating his way through theaters earlier this year, I thought to myself ""I can't wait for the DVD!!!"" I live for the behind-the-scenes stuff, so I was dying to find out how the filmmakers accomplished the effects...Gary Oldman's Verger makeup, the pigs, the climactic buffet scene....so did the DVD deliver? Pretty much. The deleted scenes were very good, and I was especially pleased to see a VERY long sequence concerning Inspector Pazzi's hunt for the infamous ""Il Mostre"". These scenes really fleshed out the characters. The 5 behind the scenes featurettes are informative, even if there is virtually NOTHING about the Verger makeup. I really enjoyed the the poster gallery, as well. The film itself looks great, and the commentary by Director Ridley Scott is a keeper. I especially liked his overview of the 3rd ending they were considering. Couldn't they have filmed the Book's ending though?"
1,Craniotomy Before Dinner,"""Hannibal"" as several characteristics that set it apart from ""Silence of the Lambs."" The plot is weak and fairly predictable. Scene transitions are poorly developed. It is gross simply for the sake of being gross. Anthony Hopkins was true to the ""Hannibal"" form but, Julianne Moore as Agent Starling was no Jodie Foster. She looked the part but no other personality traits carried over. Casting would have been improved had Ms Moore played a different agent. Finally, the movie was fairly well photographed and the DTS 5.1 sound was OK. But, overall, the film alternates between being sick and sicker. No wonder it was a box office flop."
1,Read The Book; Forget The Movie,"The book was great, but they had to twist the story all around in the movie. Why? This movie is not even close to the Silence adaptation."
1,Baddy Baddy,"An unnecessarily graphic and grotesque follow up to ""Silence of the Lambs"". It jettisons most of the psychological byplay between Lecter and Starling that made ""Silence"" so good, in favor of ""how-can-we-top-this?"" graphic violence. By the time it reaches the final ""dinner party"" scene (I'll spare the details), it's not so much gross as it is ridiculous. Julianne Moore is very good given the thankless task of filling Jodie Foster's shoes as Clarice Starling, but Sir Anthony Hopkins becomes a parody of himself as the titular Hannibal Lecter. It's not his fault, mind you. Thomas Harris and Ridley Scott just forgot that what made Hannibal the Cannibal so menacing was not seeing what he did so much as imagining what he could do."
3,Interesting,"Not up to the standard of Silence of the Lambs, but an interesting foree into the genre for Ridley Scott nevertheless. It's always fun to see Anthony Hopkins in his homicidal character. :)"
1,"Disgusting, Disturbing, Pointless","This movie contains the most disturbing scene I've ever seen on film. I won't even describe it. It's sad that Hollywood puts out this trash, even sadder that an actor such as Anthony Hopkins contributes to it, and even sadder that millions of people apparently find gratuitiously gory portrayals of cannibalism entertaining. :-("
1,"Thumbs up for Hopkins, thumbs down for Hannibal",This movie is disgusting. No one with a brain should see this movie. Sir Anthony could act his way out of a firing squad but this film is garbage.
5,Excellent!,The product arrived BEFORE its estimated arrival date and in excellent condition. It was also much more affordable than the alternatives in-store. I will definitely be buying from this purveyor when possible in the future!
2,The Silence of the lambs are way better than these sequels!,"When I first saw the Silence Of The Lambs at age 13, it was scary & disturbing and I loved it! but when I saw Hannibal it was a disappointment! The acting was good but the film itself to me was just a let down not as good as the 1st chapter. When there's a dinner scene with Hannibal & Agent Sterling with the brain from the Ray Liotta's character & even the ending inside the plane with a kid, it was straight disgusting! Saw this film once (samething with Red Dragon) and once is enough!"
2,"Falls well short of ""Lambs"" with gratuitous terror","I was disappointed in this film, though it is not entirely awful. It misses the uniquely gripping feel of ""Lambs"" and devolves into scenes of fright and terror meant to shock and revulse in the worst, gratutious way. Hopkins' performance seems thinner in some spots but almost a caricature of his Oscar-winning performance in others. Moore holds her own, but I think the film suffers from the producers' presupposition that no matter what they put on screen would benefit from the critical and popular acclaim afforded the first film. It doesn't happen here. This film is clearly ""off-note."" I didn't find myself caring more for any of the characters in this chapter. I couldn't wait until it was over. Not one I am likely to watch again."
