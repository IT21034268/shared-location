2,Not my favorite,"I had the Buns of Steel series with Donna and really liked her. I now have her new Body Gospel series, which is great. This one I bought, used once, and sold. For a large part of the workout it seems she is yelling to be heard over the music, which I found to be too distracting. In the Body Gospel series, one of the workouts is ""live"" and she does not yell. Donna does have a wonderful, uplifting personality; I just didn't like this particular workout."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I wanted to like this exercise dvd, but I can't honestly recommend it. You may think I'm just being picky, but the set design left a lot to be desired. Most exercise videos take place either in a space that looks like an aerobics classroom at a gym or on location somewhere at the beach. This set was just a large black studio. It sounds like a random thing to critique, but it took away from my ability to enjoy the video, partly because it made it seem just thrown together. I also don't think that the live music worked well with an exercise video, as the singers are distracting. The sound quality is also not that great. Overall I think the idea of Christian work out videos is a good one, but this one just wasn't made very well, and the routines themselves were a little too low impact for me. And that's coming from someone who never exercises, and was looking for a fun way to stay active."
1,Sweating in the Spirit 2,I didn't care for this video at all. It was to much going on and she didn't give you time to figure out the routines of the dance.
5,Energy,This DVD is just right for me. I get the workout I need this time of my life --- its not too easy and definitely makes me SWEAT.
1,Not one of my favorite,I've discovered after purchasing another Donna Richardson workout video that I am not a true fan of Ms. Richardson. I think my problem with her is she doesn't do a good job at demonstrating moves before transitioning to something different. I think I'll stick with my all time favorites: Turbo Jam and TaeBo Amped!
3,So-so,"I didnt enjoy it as much as the first one. The dark, disco-like setting just didnt work for me - too distracting. The DVD is also not user friendly, the first one was much easier to customize excatly what sessions you wanted without having to keep going back or repeatedly picking segments."
2,Not much real information,Very disappointed. Very few of the items were actually identified and it barely scratched the surface compared to how many playsets there were. I wanted a simple book with color photos of each playset and have it identified.
2,Beautiful photos ruined by poor book design,"If you're reading this, you likely know Levinthal's formidable talent. It's on display here, of course, but the book's design, assembly instructions superimposed next to, behind and even over the photos, distracts from his work. Self-consciously clever, the design so irritated me it was a genuinely unpleasant experience to look through this book--hardly the reaction one expects from Levinthal. Look for another introduction to his work. I am."
4,Well done and hard to find country and bluegrass CD,"If they'd stayed together longer, they'd probably have been the ""Traveling Wilburys"" of bluegrass. The group is composed of a much-younger Vince Gill, Emory Gordy Jr, Jim Buchanan, Dave Grisman, and Herb Pedersen. For the most part, the music is bluegrass and country. The musicianship and harmonies on this collection is outstanding. These guys sing almost with one voice.My favorites: ""Foggy Mountain Chimes"" with Hugh Pederson's outstanding picking, ""Lonesome River"" is just good all around, and ""Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes"" could have come off of ""O Brother Where Art Thou.""If you love country or bluegrass, this hard to find collection is well worth snatching up.Rebecca Kyle, June 2008"
4,home grow gold,"This CD is loved by everyone in my little family, I like ""as I recall"", if you listen close you come to understand that it is about a girl taking a boy out into her car, and rocking his world. I like the words. My wife likes ""angle wind"", and our 12 year old loves to dance to ""right on the lips"". I'm no expert, but I bought the CD on a ""what the heck"" mood, and it,s been in my CD player every day for the last month. LOVE IT!"
2,Poet Needs to Read More good Contemporary Indian Fiction,"Vazirani's first book of poetry gives ample illustration of the on-going celebration of the exotic in American poetry, regardless of its literary quality. There is little metaphorical or linguistic frisson in this poetry; nowhere can one find the rich use of language that marks contemporary Indian fiction writers writing in English. Vazirani is no Arundhati Roy or Kiran Desai, to name two women of her generation. Her poetry too often falls flat, with little sense of rhythm or lineation. She does indeed have a keen eye for detail and a sense of narrative line. Exotic details and stories set in foreign lands are fine,of course, but what makes a poem worth reading is its use of language. Perhaps her second book will be better."
2,A Good Story Might Not Be Poetry,"Vazirani does a good job of opening a story in bursts and fragments, but I'm not sure it amounts to poetry. The flavor of the exotic seems often to be the real reason for these poems to exist, but they seem to be more about cultural migration than about language. The narrators of her poems seem such thoroughgoing materialists, it's hard to give them the sympathy the author requests."
4,Fresh take on the alternative scene.,"This offering from Hourcast may at first seem like your run of the mill alternative offering, but a few minutes into the opening track of ""This Life"" will change your mind.Tempo changes are a plenty, and lead singer Patrick McBride makes it all work with everything from high controlled power to melodious harmonies.This CD may not be the most lyrically thought provoking, but it does have its moments.The music and melodies more than make up for it, with my personal favorite song being "" Lunar"".Some of you made have already heard this band without even realizing it, as they have a song on the ""Saw 3"" soundtrack called "" Sakkara"".Overall this CD has more ups than downs and rocks pretty well from start to finish.I gave this a four star instead of five because, although a few songs have really great lyrics, the majority are fairly basic. If pondering on taking a chance with this CD it would be money well spent."
5,Industrial Gods debut,"Mixing a primal mix of Industrial, hard rock, metal, and punk, similiar to Opiate for the masses, Hourcast are an awesome band. Songs of abandonment, hurt, pain, and other topics are all on display here. An awesome debut cd, and a must for any fan of music who feels like the world is against them."
2,Different Product Than Pictured,"I ordered the Multimedia Studio but received the Activity Studio. I thought the activity studio was nice, but it wasn't what I wanted. Now I am afraid to reorder the multi-media, fearing the same thing will happen-especially, since I was not the only one this happened to."
1,???,This was a very strange flick. I love a great horror movie but this was just plain ridiculous. Texas Chainsaw Massacre it's not. I would have to say this is the worst cannibalism movie I've ever seen. The trailer was the best part of the entire movie. B movie w/B actors. I don't recommend buying or renting this.
3,hummm,nice story a little draging at times but worth a rainy day viewing twins are twisted fun heros confused and guilt ridden
5,Precious Horror Masterpiece,"Like many who have reviewed before me, I turned to Afterdark Horrorfest with hopes of a horror genre revolution or at the very least revitalization. They're doing an okay job. It's a step up above the garbage that gets released at the movie theatres!I became slightly obsessed with this movie. I started watching it daily, figuring out more symbolism and picking up clues here and there. The movie is incredible because it does something that only true masterpieces can. It makes you sympathetic to the villain. At the end of the movie, you even feel sorry for the damned Hamilton family. Or at least I did. Maybe I'm just that twisted. But I sort of wanted to be in the Hamilton family..."
3,"Not bad, But Not What was promised with horrorfest.","Imagine if you will Near Dark with a dash of Audition and a pinch of over-acting, on a shoestring budget.This is what The Hamiltons is.Has its good moments, has its bad.may have been filmed with a home video camera, still not too bad.Hot girls though.i was decently impressed, and that's ok.end of review."
2,1 of the 8 films to die for...out of boredom!,"I generally steer clear of low-budget horror in that those films, while trying to be cutting edge, usually smack of just ""trying""...too hard. I gave ""The Hamiltons"" a go since it received the most hype. Wasn't impressed. Yes, the ending has a nice little twist, and I was intrigued by seeing Lenny--although once the twist happened it was easy to see it coming--the film lacks dramatic tension, contains mundane dialogue (victim: ""help me""; predator [whining]: ""I can't!), and characters are pretty much stock caricatures. 86 minutes drrrraggged by."
1,"Horrid, not horror","I saw this movie at horrorfest a while back and saw a link for it while looking at another movie. When I saw the number of good reviews, I felt I had to comment. This is a pseudo-horror flick. It's more like some weird dark-drama. The ""scares"" that aren't scary are few and far between. I guess the reason that people like it is the twist at the end, but it wasn't worth an hour of being bored. If you want a horror, skip it, if you want a boring mystery (kinda) then rent it immediately...but don't buy it til you see it."
3,ALL IN THE FAMILY,"This indie horror, part of Lions Gate's horror fest, is one of the strangest horror films to come down the road in some time. It is to be applauded for its unusual approach to a genre favorite--but I can't say which one without spoiling its ending.At any rate, THE HAMILTONS are a family of three brothers and one sister trying to adjust to the deaths of their parents. David, the oldest, is trying to be the head of the family; the twins Darlene and Wendell are the rebellious type; and youngest brother Francis is the quiet, morose one, obsessed with his video camera. And oh yes, they kidnap and torture several victims, which forms the core of the movie: why are they doing this?Despite its low budget, the film is an original one but it is also manipulative, confusing and only moderately well acted. But the horror fest is an interesting collection of horror movies that overall are quite entertaining. This is just not one of the best of the lot."
2,Amazingly Average Low Budget Feature,"Not surprisingly, the AFTER DARK FILMS are weak or average...The hype is silly.If you want a movie ""too scary or whatever for general audiences"" may I suggest Henry:Portriat of a Serial Killer, heck, even American Psycho pulled more intensity than these films.The Hamiltons was Ok at best, The feature was what it was, low budget horror, fine... love them... but, I failed to see what was so impressive, it looked, felt & unfolded by the standard formula, like thousands of others released all the time...I suggest a rental even for hard core horror feinds like myself before buying it...Worth a watch if you see nothing else on the rental rack, nothing more...nothing less..."
1,Blah,I've got to say this was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever partially seen. It was so bad I didn't even make it half way through. The only decent thing that I did see about it was the twins. I didn't bother to finish it later. It's not even worth the time to try again really.
4,best of the 8 films to die for,This movie was the best of the 8 films to die for IMO. I liked the idea of how the producers of this film didn't overdue with gore and left much to the imagination. It is a twisted tale of a family who has some sort of sickness where they have to (or think they have to) consume human blood to survive. It's a dark kinda film with the feeling of such flicks as Vampire Clan and Devil in the Flesh. The best character is the sister in this film--she's dark and a total nymph!! It's just a very kool dark film!!
4,nicely done horror flick,"this is a spoiler (am only mentioning it because someone else did already) but i have never been a fan of vampires; they bore the hell out of me. period. having said that, i feel this is a truly worthwhile effort. i liked the acting, writing, editing, music, camera work (especially during the ultra creepy basement scenes; however, some of the outdoor daytime footage appeared washed out, but what can you do? after all, this is low-budget--and i absolutely understand and respect what the butcher brothers and all those involved here have tried to do.kudos!butcher brothers, please do another horror flick--only can you stay clear of vampires. you guys should have done the tcm re-make, by all means!looking foreward to more great flicks from all those who made this fine horror tale possible.by the way, 8 horror films to die for is head and shoulders above the lame masters of horror series.in my humble opinion."
4,Surprisingly Really Good,"I found out that I had a cable channel that I didn't know I had and ran through their long list of movies. The Hamiltons caught my eye and I was so glad it did. It's about 4 siblings trying to survive after the death of their parents. They've lived in six residences in two years. Very shortly into the film, we find out that the sibs are kind of um....violent. Yeah....violent with the exception of the youngest brother who is trying to make sense of his family. The acting is wonderful and Cory Knauf is terrific as the little brother. This movie does have blood and gore but not as much as you would expect for a horror film. Where this film succeeds is that it actually has an intelligent script with relatable family issues. It also offers a not so surprising but a twist nevertheless at the end. Many of these horror movies are forgotten about minutes after viewing but the Hamiltons will stay with me a long time."
2,Lukewarm at best --,"I saw four of the eight films offered at the HorrorFest. The one with the biggest hype was THE HAMILTONS. I don't know why - the audience I saw this with was walking out in droves (much more than they did for WICKED LITTLE THINGS and THE ABANDONED) once they realized that this was a no-budget slacker whiner fest with some horror movie dressing. The big, ""surprise"" ending is supposed to knock us out of our seats, but doesn't. The two star rating is because it didn't suck as bad as WICKED LITTLE THINGS."
4,I liked it,"While the first two books got me hungering for more, this third book wasn't quite as compelling or engaging. I enjoyed the character of Dresden, but I found myself disliking the Michael character as a little too self-righteous and rigid. The story was good enough that I will continue reading the series."
4,A Key Book in the Series,"I read a number of the books, but somehow skipped over this one until I got to Changes. Then I realized I had to go back to read this one, and it was well worth it. Butcher has constructed the Dresden Files almost like a tv series with a multi-year arc. Each novel (episode) provides closure, but it also adds pieces to an ongoing story arc which end in a season.With Grave Peril, Butcher sets in motion the story about the War between the White Council and the Red Court, and he also puts a major complication in the way of Henry's love life.If you skip this book, a lot of the later books won't nearly make as much sense.On a different, emotional level, this book will also stay with you for quite a while."
4,pearly whites,i am hookedi love the reflection and irony in dresden's thoughts and actions such as how he choses to dress for a vamp masquerade ball!!
3,great cop connection,"Butcher writes as well as always, and that Harry was involved more with S.I. is awesome. In the first two books, Harry and S.I. work mainly on cases together, but this time cops are victims in the investigation. Its great! I recommend to anyone interested - just read Fool Moon and Storm Front first!"
4,Not as fast a read as the first two,"Still a great book, and crucial in plot development to the series, but a more sorrowful book. I missed the humor. Overall good, just not my favorite"
4,Another fun read,"This does come off as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Ridiculously fun, though. As before, read the others first. And you likely know if you are going to like this, already."
5,great dresden book,"Great dresden book and pissed off ghosts...You gotta like Harry.. he is nice, tries to do the best he can and always messes up the thing he is trying to ""right.""Bob the skull and his cat round out the entertainment..."
3,Religious Overtones,"About halfway into this book, having read the first two, I began to grow concerned regarding the heavy Christian themes. The further I read, the worse it got, until I finally I had to put the book down.After a bit of research into the following books, I found that this wasn't a theme that was likely to change.Until I got sick of it, this was the best book in the series. It's too bad the religious pinnings ruined it."
1,New Rule: Random Rules Suck,"I had to walk away from this book about half way through. Butcher's writing is kinda rough, his women are cliched, and Harry getting the snot beat out of him before rallying to save the day was predictable. All of that was to be expected from book 1 and 2. Where I lost it was the endless introduction of arbitrary magic rules. Apparently, an evil witch is allowed to steal a holy sword if the previous wielder attempted to use the sword in a betrayal. Also, ghosts do not like water. Who knew? I just couldn't take it any more... there's probably some fancy literary word for making up random stuff in order to drive a plot... whatever it is, it sucks. I read the synopsis for book 3 and it looks like the arbitrary magic rules continued through the whole book. I'm glad I set it down!Since my friend is pushing the book series so hard, I must press on to book 4. Wish me luck!"
4,"A Little Jarring At First, But Takes Off Nonetheless","At the beginning of the book, I felt like I'd missed a book between ""Fool Moon"" and ""Grave Peril"". Butcher introduces a new sidekick for Harry without giving the reader any idea of how these two met and the new character's backstory. I was also confused because the book drops you right into the middle of the action, then tells the set-up in a flashback. However, once I got into it, ""Grave Peril"" was just as exciting as the other Harry Dresden books. The thing that I like about this series as opposed to other supernatural mysteries is that Butcher gets magic RIGHT. It's a power, neither good nor evil. It's the user's intentions that are good or evil. Mr. Butcher, KEEP WRITING!"
1,Just horrible,"Harry Dresden is back again as self-righteous, irritating, and thoroughly unlikable as ever.The plot of this book is interesting, but can't overcome shallow, insipid characters and dialog so bad that you'll find yourself thinking that whoever wrote 'The Hardy Boys' series should be put up for a Nobel prize.Play it safe and avoid this book and all ""Dresden Files"" books."
4,Well-Textured Urban Fantasy World,"After reading the first two books in this series, I was so intrigued to see where Dresden's story is going that I've ordered the Dresden Files TV series through Netflix. I am not much of a fantasy reader but this series is definitely an exception and this third book was very well done.Grave Peril, the third installment in the Dresden Files, is a grittier, darker, scarier book than the first two. Once again, Harry Dresden, Chicago's only resident wizard detective, is called upon to fight an evil entity called the Nightmare, a ghostly being that is able to rouse up other ghostly apparitions and harm friends of Harry's. This time Harry is assisted by the stalwart Michael Carpenter, a Knight of the Cross.This was a wonderful read; the book has plenty of action, mystery, and likable characters. Highly recommended."
3,"Too much going on, but still good.","I hope to finish this series off--the books I've read so far were good reads--but I wish Butcher would quit trying to throw so much at us. I mean, Harry can only be on his last ounce of energy so many times. And Butcher keeps throwing in so many plot twists that he has to wrap them all up in the last chapter. It's annoying. But, still, I've enjoyed the books so far and can't wait to read book 4."
3,Super Reader,"I have not read the second book, but it seems Harry Dresden has moved a step out of the poverty area, and has started to be a scarier arsekicker, with a bunch of vampire roastings, demon ghost huntings, etc.He also has picked up a Knight of God helper, and managed to get his reporter girlfriend into a lot of trouble.This novel starts out as ghostbusting, and escalates beyond what at first seems a fairly mundane and straightforward plot."
2,The Last Encounter for Dresden and I,"This is really it for Harry and I (unless I still have another installment on my shelf...). This is number three and I still am not compelled by the character lineup. I heard an interview with Mr. Butcher about this book and he mentioned how many fans feel that Grave Peril is when the series really gets started. I didn't have that reaction to this book. Just when I begin to get into the story I am annoyed by Harry's constant guilt trip. The dashing, duster-clad hero is always obligating himself to everyone else and then goes on a guilt trip, reader in tow, when something goes awry. I don't like to hang out with people like that in real life so I most certainly don't enjoy the ""it's all my fault, it always is"" types for my fictional retreat each day.[...]"
4,Grave Peril is a good instalment in the series,"This novel includes the introduction of Michael and his family who become important characters in the following stories. I really enjoyed the ghost story aspects, and would say this is one of the more interesting Dresden stories."
3,"An Improvement, But Still Not Quite There Yet...","I'm approximately halfway through this book as of 1/15/2013. I'm enjoying it; it's pleasant brain candy that is reminiscent of the early books of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series.One thing that reeeeallllly bugged me when I read the first Dresden Files novel was Harry Dresden's chauvinistic attitude that he claimed was mere chivalry and an old-fashioned attitude towards females. Not cool, Dresden/Mr. Butcher. There are still shadows of that in this book. It, and other parts of the novel are somewhat worrisome and annoying. I'll keep reading, probably at least through the next three novels (I own them after all), but if the attitude doesn't shift at least a little, I cannot see myself continuing with this series. I enjoy them but I'd rather re-read Seanan McGuire's excellent October Daye series, which are structured in a similar manner, but feature a female protag and plenty of other strong women."
3,The sidekick almost ruins it,The plot is good. The action is great. But the Michael character is beyond irritating. I spent the book hoping that he'd be killed.
3,Warning: not the best in the series,"The first two books in the series were great. This one begins in the middle of events, with a new supporting character, and it takes a few chapters to figure out what's going on. Butcher should have added a few chapters to the beginning to make the book easier to track."
2,Written to a formula?,"The first book was ok - took a little getting used to. The second book revealed a pattern. This book confirmed it. It looks to me like a formula - Harry gets involved, Harry has lots of trouble, Harry finds a way to win the day. Sadly, the formula, characters, and situations are not interesting enough to justify buying another book in the series."
5,Used Books,"This series is awesome. Book Candy at its finest.All the used book people need to take a moment and read this. I should be able to buy this book for $4 used, but all the sellers are starting at about $4 and then adding the 3.99 shipping, so $8 used. ;( These used book people need to take a clue and realize it won't move at that price. Hello Library, can you put that book on hold for me thanks. SORRY used book people."
4,Harry goes ghostbusting,"In the third of the Dresden Files series, Chicago's only wizard PI Harry Dresden, is called to Cook County Hospital to investigate a ghost tormenting the maternity ward. What he discovers makes him realize that he and his friends are literally in grave peril. The ghost is under a torture spell and that spell is slowly effecting the people Harry cares about most.If you enjoy fantasy or mysteries with a supernatural angle, you're going to like Dresden. I'd strongly recommend you begin reading at ""Storm Front"" and continue forward, but you don't have to do so. Each novel stands alone and they're all strong additions to both mystery and fantasy.Rebecca Kyle, December 2008"
5,Grave Peril Review,Jim Butcher once again proves his talent for fantasy writing. This is the second time I have read this novel and I enjoyed it more the second time around. I look forward to finishing the series.
4,pretty good but unpolished,"The books needs some major edit work. It appears to have been rushed. Misspelled words and interrupted flow of words are common.Its a bit hard to follow, a lot has happened since the last book, new characters are everywhere. I like it. There was a direct story, a plot, a resolution, and an opening for the next book in the series. This book is not filler until a new idea came to the author, this is a new idea. Nicely done characters, but poorly polished. All the rough work is there, just needs to be cleaned up."
4,"Good Series, Give it 4 1/2 Stars","Just finished all 3 books in the last couple of weeks. Lots of action, keeps your interest. Will definitly keep up with this series. Just wish the author would get Dresden, the hero, and Murphy, the female cop, together. She a great character but has not had a large enough role in the books, yet."
3,"Good book, could have been better","Third book in the series. I loved the first two, feel ambivalent about this one. I wish the book had ben longer, because it seemed as if a lot was missing from the beginning. And the new character Michael was intersting concept-wise, but without a backstory it felt like there was a gaping hole in terms of characterization. Still, it's a good, quick read. And you have to read it because you're gonna move on to the next in the series, just like I did."
3,Did I miss something???,"When I first began this book I checked the cover several times to make sure it was book 3, I even checked on line to see if there was something I may have missed inbetween 'Fool Moon' and 'Grave Peril'. I kept getting lost in the plot, who was Micheal? I even scanned through the first two books to see if there was any reference to 'Micheal' or the mysterious 'Kravos'. The plot seems to be based on events and people that no one has any prior knowledge of, it was very confusing.The one thing about the book that I did love was that Murphy had such a small role in the plot, there is nothing likeable about her character, sure she's a tough, hard bitten detective who takes no crap from anyone but her single mindedness makes her appear stupid and really annoying.I did enjoy the book but not as much as the others."
2,Shoulda Heeded Other Reviews,"I tried this to split HDMI signal from two computers to one monitor - could only get signal if I unplugged one input until computers booted and then reconnect HDMI plug. Even then, monitor often displayed interference artifacts on screen. I recently tried to use it to split signal from DTV receiver to an HDTV and to an A/V receiver connected to another HDTV. When I turned on both units, the TV popped and shut itself off - no picture on other TV. No harm done, but it appears this splitter will not work for my purposes. I note that others have purported that you can only have one device sending signal at a time and it is not compatible with HDMI v1.3, so take note of your requirements. I think I was initially too critical of splitter and should have better understood its intended use and would caution others to likewise take heed."
1,No Audio Out,"It only splits a video source, but no audio. How dumb..... No where did it mention it as a video only source. HDMI is supposed to do both..."
3,crackling sound,"i got my hdmi splitter today and plugged it right away.as soon the screen appears a crackling/noise sound is coming out.i plugged back in directly my old cable, there was no cracking/noise sound, so i guess its the splitter.i know its suppose to be not doing that, but its a splitter?is this the natural limitation/cons of the hdmi splitter or i just got a defective one?im using it on my PlayStation 3 console.amazon pls reply asap."
1,You need a splitter box for HDMI,"You need a box with some smarts to split HDMI if you want acceptable results. HDMI is digital, bidirectional, encrypted, and copy protected. A simple splitter cable is not going to work like it did with analog A/V cables. Monoprice and Geffen make splitter boxes. Expect to pay $100+ to get something that will actually work for splitting HDMI. The expression you get what you pay for definitely applies to this."
1,Cables Unlimited Premium HDMI Splitter (PCM-2275),"Purchased this item despite the bad reviews. Well I learned my lesson. Splitter does not work. It does work as a straight through with one device connected, but the moment I connected a second device it stopped working. I also did not have the receiving devices on concurrently (power on). I tested each one independently - still didn't work. Wasted my time. Returned it today to Amazon."
1,Worthless,"All I needed was to be able to split my cable box's output to 2 tvs. SO I thought it would be as easy as buying a splitter and cables and hooking it up. Well I shouldve listened to all the bad reviews because this thing simply did not work. I tried everything, turning one thing on before the other, both on at the same time, using different cables and outputs and inputs. Nothing... I thought I would gamble on these simply because they were priced so low but dont make the same mistake I did."
1,12 inch HDMI cable splitter is money wasted,"Bought this to split signal out of a computer graphics card to two televisions. After connecting it to my graphics card and just one TV, I tried to watch a streaming video signal. Within just a couple of minutes, the TV picture started flashing on and off. I made sure that cable and splitter were seated properly at every connection to no avail. I removed the splitter and plugged in just the cable and picture was fine from then on. Splitter appears to be wasted money."
1,HDMI passive Splitters are a waste...,"This item is useless, i got it thinking i would be able to connect my hdmi cable box and my hdmi upscaling dvd player, but neither work when they are both connected picture/sound flashes, they drown out each others signal even if the other device is powered off, like the signal is leaking backwords. The only way it works is if you have only 1 device plugged in to it, so that makes it pretty useless, unless you needed a 12inch hdmi extender...... I would of sent it back but it was so cheap it wasnt worth the time and effort.Complete junk do not waste your time, get an active switch if you need more HDMI ports"
1,Item is a waste of money,The splitter can only accept 1 video source at a time so if you need to operate a different hdmi source you have to plug it in and unplug the other. There is almost no use at all for this item.
1,Save your money,"Save your money and instead buy hdmi box because this unit is useless, first of all you cant have this hooked up to two tv's if you would like to splitt the signal from xbox360 for example its not going to work. secondly it distorts the signal big time, hdmi is for high quality viewing and this product does not provide this. i tried hooking up xbox360 to one input and ps3 to the other, the splitter was hooked up to my tv. xbox would be very veryyy distorted and the picture was flashing at the same time. too bad i have to give this product one star because it desereves 0!"
1,HDMI SPLITTER DOES NOT WORK,"I have a DENON amp with a HDMI out. I put the splitter in the amp output. I connected my LCD and a Projector. NO SIGNAL ON EITHER. This product does not work. So while playing around, I put the splitter into an HDMI input, and connected my ps3 to one of the ports. I used my regular HDMI cable to connect to my projector. I got a picture. This is a crap product that no one should buy. It simply does not work. Period. I do not care what the seller is saying, its only going to destroy any reputation they had, I would not buy from them ever again."
1,Don't bother,"This splitter worked once after I hooked it up this week. The second time, I only got audio through the TV...no picture. Wish I had realized there was such a difference in splitters and ordered a better one the first time."
1,DEAD ON ARRIVAL,"Not much I can say about this... Didn't work a bit when it arrived. Great concept, simple design, failure on implementation."
1,Does not split one signel in to two consistently,"I only got it to work once. One signal to two HD TV's. One 3' cable one 10' cable. Picture would split ok after some plugging and unplugging and turning all the devices on and off. If you turn one monitor off they both would turn off. Turn back on both would loose sound and picture would return. This is a splitter, one signal split in two. Not a switch two or more signals (HD recivers, BlueRay, Game machine ECT) to one monitor. As a splitter it fails to work consistently. If you're just splitting the image it worked ok. If you want sound buy a splitter with a signal booster. There about $35.00 on up. All the reviews that say it doesn't work are correct. Don't listen to the guy that is accusing everybody of thinking it is a switch. IT DOESN'T WORK"
1,Amazon should NOT be carrying this product,"I had assumed that Amazon wouldn't be carrying non-functioning products when I purchased this and didn't bother reading the reviews first. As everyone else has said, this product does not work in any form or fashion. I am just hoping they will give me my money back for it."
1,Does not work,Amazon needs to stop carrying this item entirely. I wish I had read the rest of the reviews. I am simply connected two TV's with 6' HDMI cables to a cable box. When only one TV is connected it works fine. As soon as you try to have both connected the signal is too weak and neither TV has picture or audio. I will look for a splitter that is also a signal amplifier or at least has good reviews.
1,Does not work as expected,"I tried to use this product with a PS3 by splitting the signal coming out of the PS3 and sending it to two different TVs. When hooked up in this configuration, the video and audio is choppy on both TVs. With only a single TV connected, the sound and audio is transmitted without the signal breaks so I am sure the cable is fine. Basically this ""splitter"" is not really a splitter at all. I do not recommend this product. But if you insist on purchasing one, I have one I will sell for cheap . . ."
2,Did not work.,"Unfortunately it appears that when you split the signal you need a ""power"" or ""signal"" boast. As soon as I installed this device I lost the signal to both devices."
1,RIPPED OFF,The product in question never functioned. It was supposed to be used for a super bowl party to send a signal to a second television and it never worked. I would not recommend this seller or any of their other products. At least I only lost 10 bucks. Live and learn
1,Rotten Aple Splitter,Avoid this badly made low quality product. IT'S NT WORTH THE MONEY AND ISN'T BUILT WELL ENOUGH TO FIT INTO OTHER FMALE HDMI SLOTS. Even high-school students in shop class can mke a better product
1,Bad Design,The two female connectors are both too shallow to allow proper engagement with the cables. The connector would not pass a signal even when I held the cable in place by hand.
1,Waste of money!,"I should have read the reviews first. So pay $12.14, and LEARN!I bought this to split the signal between a Roku box and DVD player. Each component works when it is the only one hooked up to the cable. When both are hooked up, neither works. They should not even be selling these thins, because they are useless.What I should have bought was a switcher. Live and learn!"
1,Junk,"Don't buy this thing. It will only work with one output plugged in, basically making it an expensive 12"" HDMI extension."
1,A Splitter that does not Split,"I couldn't believe the other reviews but they were true. All I wanted was a simple device that allowed me to view TV shows from a single H T M I cable source (converter box) to two H D TVs in different rooms. The TVs need not be on at the same time. The ""splitter did not even allow me to have both TVs plugged into the splitter with the power to one of the TVs turned off. I am glad it did not cost much; a complete load of rubbish."
2,No audio pass through,I wanted to use this to split my hdmi output from my direct tv receiver to two TV sets. With two sets connected only video went through. Unplug either set and you would get audio and video. Had to replace with a powered splitter.
1,Terrible,Doesn't work in my situation. The computer HDMI does not detect TV and neither does Blueray player. Don't buy it.
1,junk.,No mater the use doesn't work. Tried it with different cables and on different outputs. Just doesn't work. Do not buy. Waste of money.
2,Not quite what was expected,"Product shipped and receievd very quickly, however it only sort of works. Must toggle system on/ off to work at times."
1,No Good HDMI,"To put it simple, it didn't work. When one cable was plugged in it was ok, when two are plugged in they cancel out each other. No good!"
1,Beware of passive splitters,"!Important!: Due to the current state of the technology, results using HDMI and DVI splitters can be mixed. Especially passive splitters which rely on the individual devices ability to negotiate a 3 way handshake. The problem is not all devices are programmed to deal with this properly and will sometimes default to a HDCP error state. To put it simply, some devices will consider the splitting of a signal to be a copyright violation, which could result in only one display being shown at a time or the blocking of content altogether. This type of situation is considered to be a device compatibility issue and can not be fixed short of a firmware update by the individual device manufacturers. Before purchasing this splitter, please be advised that we have no control over nor are we responsible for compatibility issues (including HDCP issues)."
1,Snow with 720p/1080i sources and no video on 1080p,"Not sure if the other reviewer ""Nando"" actually tried using this particular splitter??This splitter is useless. You purchase a splitter because you need to send the output to two displays (in my case a TV and a Projector). However, with this splitter, the picture results in some snow when using 480i/480p/720p/1080i sources (such as directv or comcast). And using the splitter results in no video at all with 1080p sources such as PS3 Blu-Ray. Audio output from all sources functioned properly, but without proper video output, this device is non-functional. Solution: I removed the splitter from my configuration (my HDMI cables are not the problem).I'm searching for another splitter."
1,Splits signal but removes sound,"I purchased this ""splitter"" to send the signal from my DirecTV receiver to two LCD televisions. One in the bedroom and the other mounted on the wall in the master bathroom. I hooked it up and it sent the signal to both TV's, but NO SOUND. HDMI is supposed to carry the video AND the sound signal. When you use this splitter you lose the sound to BOTH TV sets. It was a complete waste of money."
2,Works by SWITCHING and not BRIDGING Two TVs,This product acts more like a SWITCH than a BRIDGE. This is not clear in the instructions.You can reliably use one TV or the other. You cannot use both TVs at the same time. It switches by sensing power to the TVs.Note this is not for switching between two sources. It is for switching between two TVs.
1,This product does not work,"If you need to run 2 monitors off of 1 HDMI out, this product should do it for you if it only worked. I just tried it and it does not work and now I have to return it. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,READ THE REVIEW,"I ususally read the reviews but I obviously missed this one. While this is seemingly cheap product it is useless. As another review mentions, there is no audio pass-through unless you connect one source, turn 1 display on, and then you can connect the second. When you turn the power off on the first, you start all over. You get what you pay for."
1,this sucks,yeah it does have clear picture but it amazon fails to tell us that theres no audio .. ready to return
1,Does not work,"Correction: Device does work but I must have both TV's on at the same time for application, still disappointing as this does not work for me. -I tried using to to display my comcast cable on 2 TV's but as soon as you plug in the 2nd connector the picture goes out. Both outputs work but only with 1 cable plugged in at a time. I do not see how this device could be helpful to anyone."
1,"Splitter provides great picture, but NO AUDIO","Read the description for this splitter very closely and you notice it mentions nothing about audio or audio quality. Very deceptive advertising, as it doesn't outright mention the fact that it provides no audio pass through whatsoever! Buyer Beware."
1,Ben from California,"This item is useless, do not BUY. I tried to use it to split between my projector and TV. It worked with one output (TV or Projector) connected but it was full of snow, as soon as I connected the second output the picture dies out. It only does up to 720P, 1080P kills it. Don't waist your money!"
1,Item does not work,"Item does not work.I dead all negative reviews before buying. From those negative reviews I learnt that people expected this cable to deliver HD signals to 2 HD output devices at the same time. The item's description clearly stated that it just SPLITS the original signal and is only able to deliver HD signal to one device at a time (so only one screen e.g. can be ON at one time). I understood this and disagreed with all 150+ or so negative reviewers. I bought three (3) cables. Not one works as I expected the cables are DEFECTIVE. If you connect just ONE device to either one of the outputs (thus connecting the device just in between an existing input and output) the signal does not come thru. I live in Curacao and send stuff I buy from Amazon to my hotel room whilst in the USA, i was thus also unable to return the product. Do NOT make the mistake i made !. This product is DEFECTIVE and does not work under ANY circumstances. Believe me and other 150+ negative reviews."
1,Piece of crap,"So even though the splitter is cheap it is not worth it. About 4 minutes after opening the package the splitter end was broken. This item is made to be very cheap. I was using it to split my one device an xbox 360 to 2 displays, a capture card in my computer and my LCD TV. I did as instructed by the little instruction manual in the packaging saying turn one display after another. At first it worked then the sound cut out and all of a sudden it was a blue snow storm on my TV. I very carefully took the splitter out from my xbox and noticed the casing just fell off the end of the splitter and the wires were exposed. If anyone else is trying to set up to record your xbox to your computer and play without lag and keeping the quality in tact then i suggest an amplifier to solve your issue. I'm hoping this one splitter was a factory defect because if they all break like this I feel sorry for how many people they scam into buying this POS."
1,Does NOT work,"Do not bother. It simply does not work. The picture flashes, has lines and that's if you are lucky enough to get any picture at all. It's no wonder that every other HDMI splitter out there is several hundred dollars! I bought a gefen HDMI splitter box instead and it works flawlessly."
1,This does not work,"I tried to hook up my ps3,xbox360 and cable to two tvs and all i got was a black screen."
1,Not what i thought it was going to be...,"I wanted something to allow me to plug two hdmi cords into my tv's one hdmi slot, but this product is for the opposite. The product description really didn't specify what it did either way. kind of a waste of money."
1,Dissapointing - Not recommended,"I bought this item to split the HDMI output from my Sony AVR to two TVs. One was a Samsung 17"" LCD and the other my main Samsung 50"" DLP. The signal was inconsistent and I experienced intermittent output to both screens. I returned the item after a few days and received full credit from Amazon. I have since purchased the Accell UltraAV K078C-001B 1x2 HDMI Splitter (also from Amazon) and have had no problems."
1,Poor product,"When you connect this splitter, you have to run both displays at the same time. If you turn one off, the other one loses the signal, making you run both devices. They do not tell you this before you buy, so take note."
1,Doesn't Work,"I ordered this splitter to run HD Cable to two TV's using HMDI. If I had both TVs connected (it did not mater if it was turned on or not)when I turned the box on, I could not get a high def signel or sound to the TV's. If I unpluged one and then turned on the cable box The signal would be fine and then I could plug the other in and have a signal to both. This was not the point I wanted to be able to just turn a TV on and get HDTV. I have already sent it back for refund, and been refunded."
2,A pro-Chavez telling of recent Venezuelan history,"I purchased this book hoping to get an objective look at the events that brought Chavez to power in Venezuela. Maybe that was not realistic given how polarizing Chavez is. The truth is that this book tells the story of the ""Battle of Venezuela"" from a left wing point of view. If that's what you're looking for then you'll probably enjoy it. That is all fine and good, but buyer beware."
4,Early Fleck-sibility,"Don't look for a typical representation of the New Grass Revival in Bela's foray into jazz and blues. Purely instrumental, the selections here demonstrate the flexibility and range of Bela Fleck, not to mention his New Grass companions. The title track is in a fast groove, with New Grass members trading their usual hot licks, but the selections ease off from there into a slower pace jazz. For die-hard Fleck and New Grass fans, this recording is certainly a ""deviation"". While not necessarily essential, it does offer an insight into the virtuosity of these thrilling musicians, especially with Bela fronting the group."
2,digital mobi frame,"The picture is very small and hard to see from more than a foot or two away or if you are not looking at it striaght on. It is easy to use, but the picture quality is poor."
5,A Must-Read for All!,"A truly wonderful book for kids, with beautiful language and exuberant illustrations! Worlds away from the standard subjects entertained by most kids books, Hoopes thrills with her tale of a man who wakes seized by the urge to bake, and Brad Sneed's loopy drawings are the perfect accompaniment. The story has the crisp ring of the real, and challenges young listeners on many different levels at once. Recommended without reservation."
4,Nice!,"Ring looked bigger in the picture, but i should have known that. Overall the ring looks great!"
3,A good book for the Florida gardening novice.,"This book is perhaps one of the most commonly available to Florida gardeners. For the novice, the book has an abundance of general information, but is too vague for anyone beyond an advanced amateur. Color photos of average quality are found throughout the book."
2,Outdated,"This book is way too general and most definitely outdated. Many plants one might consider for Florida are missing; for those interested in North Florida gardening, many plants are discouraged that have, in the last ten years, been bred to withstand a cooler climate. For example, he excludes gardenias for North Florida, but I've grown them quite successfully as far north as Charlotte, NC. Where is info on Sago Palms (I know they're Cycads), but they are popular in Florida - why no info? The ""Annual"" section reads like a northeast primer.In the last 10 years Elephant Ears have exploded in variety, in this book, just a vague short paragraph addresses this exotic foliage. Definitely need something more up to date."
3,okay for newbies,"The book didn't really have any pertinent info for me, most of which I already knew and was for beginners. However I picked it up cheap at a used book store and I am satisfied enough with it to keep it with the rest of the gardening books."
5,Enlightenment by way of evisceration,"What a wonderful resource for students of poetry--whether discovering Dickinson for the first time, completing an MFA, or holding a Ph.D in literature and a full professorship. Snodgrass takes some of the most powerful poems in the English language, and eviscerates them. We are often left with hilariously or shamefully dull, clunky verse, that shows by negative example just what made the original so great.This is not only a text for use in poetry classes, although the 101 ""de/composed"" poems are taken from Snodgrass's own work as a teacher. There's plenty of knowledge available to the casual reader in comparing the two versions of each poem and reading the accompanying discussion. That itself is a pleasure to read, direct, lucid, insightful, and often humorous. A definite five stars!"
5,What a great way to avoid clutter,"I love having this litter chute in my car. It fits easily to the back of my passenger seat, but it is not too bulky for passengers in the back seat. I have been in many cars with litter chutes that were too big and bumped my knees the whole ride. This one is small enough that it is not a major nuisance. Also it fits a lot of trash! My favorite part is that it does not have a lid so I don't have to mess with trying to open it when I am driving!"
2,"Mediocre At Best, 2 stars to give it the benefit of the doubt.","Broly was one of my least favorite DBZ movies, along with Bojak unbound. One of the reasons I have a problem with a lot of the DBZ movies is that they follow the same pattern, Goku kills the main ""bad guy"" while the others are left weak and powerless. This movie in particular seemed slow on the action. Lastly, without bias, I can say that Vegeta was out of character as he said phrases like ""Im going to be killed, were all going to be killed, he's the legenedary super saiyan."" It bothers me when someone is out of character this much. To improve the DBZ movies, the creators must realize there are characters other than Goku, a few entire movies without him would be nice."
4,One of the best DBZ movies out there!,"First,I will like to start by saying that this film is one of the best I have ever seen that is based on the popular anime series dragon ball Z(DBZ for short).This movie features one of the best fights in the DBZ universe:SS Broly v.s.Everyone.Broly is by far the best of the DBZ movie villains.The dubbed version is great but I bought my copy because it featured the original japanese version relesed by Toei Animation in 1992.So if you ae a DB/Z/GT fan I recommed buying this movie."
3,A little confusing,"Where does this occur on the DBZ timeline? I know a this movie is just meant to be fun but I think it needs to be a little bit more rounded in developement.And What's up with Vegeta?A bottle might as well be stuck in his mouth. Uugh, it was revolting to watch his pathetic whining. No dignity like the Vegeta portrayed previously. This must have occurred before Gohan reveals his awesome hidden power. Anyway, overall it is worth watching but I think it could have been done better."
5,broly,"the first thing is it is uncut beause the japaness one has words but the english one is clean(except you see broly and goku naked) also the english version has awseme music by tendril,slow rosewell el-gato and more. these events happen after gohan reaches super saiyan 1(they forget about cell)basiclly what happens is every one is at a picnic except goku and chi-chi and then suddenly a saiyan called paragus brings a army and asks him to rule new vegita and then they look for the legendery super saiyan while broly whas heping vegita find...himself! and then they find that out when goku meets brolly and then vegita becomes a baby (not baby from gt, baby as in infint) and then they fight and a comet distroys new vegita but goku uses instant transmission to get to piccolo's ship and they reach home."
4,not bad,"the fights in this movie as the review above says, "" it is too one sided"" but it is defintley a must buy if you are a hardcore dbz fan. i think that it is about time funi decided to start bringing out some of the better dbz movies."
4,Lots of beefcake,"Dragonball (especially Z) is known for its bevy of insanely-muscled men, and this movie sure ain't an exception to that rule, especially in the case of Broly. Overall this is a fun movie if you're a fan of Dragonball, and it introduces the aforesaid Broly for the first time (he would then appear again in two later DBZ movies)We learn a bit more about the Saiyans and their history, and the storyline itself is interesting, with its funny and serious moments. Overall a good addition to the DBZ franchise."
3,Best of the Broly Movies,"This Dragonball Z movie is the best one of the Broly series, which includes Broly: Second Coming and Bio-Broly. I give this 3 stars for an interesting story and some excellent fight scenes. I like the way Broly looks, but not the way he fights. I deducted this one 2 stars because it had such a horrible ending."
2,Worst i've seen in dragon ball z,"Worst movie. I think this one is not near as good as the earlier movies. Broly whoops everybody, but goku at the end beats him with a regular punch? what happened to ending them with a spirit bomb or kamehameha? the music is actually really good. not worth $20. First 3 movies are the best. but, it is dragonball z. but this movie is long and boring, and that is why i give it a 2 out of five."
4,This movie was great but it just followed the same old routine.,"I liked this alot.The action and comedy was great and alla dat but the only problem is it follows the same routine as almost all of the DbZ movies.Villian comes, everybody gets their asses whooped, Goku needs them to donate their energy, then he makes a big-ass spirit bomb only this time he punched Broly in the gut.It's just that using the same way to get rid of enemies just gets, gets plain ""Old"".This was good but like i said doing they're same old thing."
4,The best movie when it comes to the first Broly movie.,"When it comes to sequels for some movies, the first one is always the best. Spider-Man 1 is the best out of 3, Jaws 1 is the best out of 4. This 1st Broly movie is by far the best out of 3. The story, and the action is good. I like how towards the final battle in the beginning where Goku, Gohan, and Trunks turn Super Saiyan and start to fight Broly. Then later Broly beats Goku, Gohan, and Trunks, and then Piccolo arrives to the scene and saves them from Broly killing them. But the final battle's best part is where Goku fights him alone. That's when it comes to the action part. The story is just good because it's about Broly as the legendary super saiyan."
3,WARNING-UNCUT IS STILL CUT,I just wanted to let the die hard fans out there know that there is still some editing in the un-cut version. I compaired the so called UNCUT FUNimation version to the original TOEI version and some sceens are cut especialy some small parts of certain fight sceens. This was the first and last time I touch a FUNimation product.
5,Great cable for very low price,DON'T waste your money with fancy cables. This one does the job just as well.
5,More truth than the Bilble,"Ralph Ellis never ceases to amaze us with his highly right-brained yet scholarly ""joining of the dots"".There are very few facts about this area, and many of them obfuscated by conventional historians clinging to their flawed careers.Ralph's books are a complete blast of sunlight and once you accept that NOBODY can get any of this 100% right, you realise there are more facts in his books than in all the collective religious books on the planet. The Old testament is a curious mix of deeply encoded esoteric messages and a re-writing of history, and the New Testament has been brutally and cynically altered an molded. Other religious books carry the same mix of corruption, spin, dogma, and almost NO facts.Bravo to Mr. Ellis for trying to put some factual perspective onto this subjective stage.Tempest & Exodus"
3,ARE YOU HIGH?,"This has nothing to do with the quality of the movie. Pokemon is awesome. If this movie was a man I would jump it in a dark alley and have my sweaty way with it. No, the problem is the price. WHat is with selling this movie for over a hundred dollars? Don't get me wrong, I like pokemon, but really? REALLY? REEEEEEEAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLY?!?!?!?! Was this movie birthed from Mew's vagina itself, blessed by the great God Arceus and then knighted by Mewtwo himself? Even then, I would only pay forty dollars at most. This is a load of miltank crap. I just want to relive my childhood without having my wallet sodomized. Is that so much to ask? Apparently so. Whatevs. Will buy a used copy. I refuse to allow the man to bring me down."
1,"""Just Say No"" to Pokemon.","I can't see why any animator, filmmaker, normal human being, or child could possibly respect this lame movie and cartoon series. This movie doesn't have anything that makes a movie good.Story? There is none. There is no plot, this movie consists of little creatures running around and doing mindless slapstick moves on each other.Animation? This is what really stands out as being horrendous. Dialogue consists of 2 frames of animation (one with the mouth open, one with it closed). Not that it matters, the dialogue is never in sync anyway.This is just a lame movie. It is just low quality animation, with BAD and ANNOYING voice acting, and a very low production value. This movie says ""I was made in a couple of weeks, for a couple of bucks.""This movie is unhealthy to children. Pretend this is the plague, and stay away."
1,A movie based on a [bad] TV show can't be that good,"First there were Pokemon: The Video games. The games were decent, but nothing special. Then came a horrible TV show starring an annoying, whiny-voiced kid (Ash) and a little yellow electric rat(pikachu). My brother owns this movie. I have seen it a few times. I was not impressed, but then again, I wasn't too happy with the... TV show on which it is based. The message in the movie-it's what's inside that matters-has been overused in other children's movies. Fans of the TV show (like my brother) will enjoy it, but the movie(and the show) are too inconsistent with the Game Boy games. Hearing the annoying voice of Ash and watching him make stupid decisions detracts even more from the movie. The worst part is, there's not one but TWO sequels. What were they thinking?"
3,It's ok at best,"Pokemon the first movie is an example how a tv to movie should not be done. Pokemon the first movie is is basically an extension of the series with little effort otherwise.Pokemon the first movie is about Assh, Misty, Brock and a few other trainers lured to a mysteriouse Island to battle a mystery trainer. The trainer turns out to be Mewtwo hell bent on on destroying the world. With each pokemon defeated he clones them to increase his army. The trainers fight back with the help of Mew to defeate Mewtwo.This basically tries to create a compelling movie but instead makes an extension of the series. The plot is really lacking and instead focus more on action. So little kids will love it but parents will get bored."
2,Is this pokemon?,"The story of Pokemon: The First Movie is a dark one. Mewtwo, a cloned pokemon, hates humans and how they treat pokemon. So, Mewtwo causes a storm intending to rid the world of humans and the weak pokemon. The story is almost too dark for pokemon."
3,"Its was ok, your kids will love it!","Being 23 years old i do not feel ashamed to say that i also love the characters in the pokemon series. I love the special features of the DVD version and the fact that i get a card and a preview of the next movie. If your kids like pokemon here it is....just get it! - I felt that pikachus vacation was actually more entertaining than the actually movie because it seems to drag a bit with no real story line other than the fact that you know that eventually mew and mewtwo will fight, another plus is that you see dragonite for the first time in color, overall a pretty good japanese animation flick but not the best, may the next one be even better."
2,Really boring,"My brother has this movie, and at first I liked it. But soon after, I got sick of it. I mean, it's like any other movie: Something or someone trying to have world domination just because some Pokemon thinks that the human race is evil. Puh-lease! The only thing I like about it is Mew, but the Pokemon don't even use their powers when their fighting like they do in Pokemon battles. And they don't even know why they're fighting! It's like being racist. And they're trying to teach kids a ""valuable"" lesson, don't fight. We hear that from everyone quite enough. Besides, Pokemon are a bad influence on kids. Some kids are so desperate they STEAL Pokemon cards. The movie's trying to get you to spend your money on some movie. It's just a movie. You're bound to see it some other time. And if you don't, don't spend your money on some dumb movie."
2,US cuts ruined the film,"Why exactly did they make cuts to the movie? I am baffled to this move, but compared to the Japanese version of the movie, which had real emotions attached to the storyline, this one falls flat. The entire pre-story isn't told.If you or your kids are into Pokémon, obviously this is a must buy. But, if you're an adult Pokémon fan or you want your kids to see a much more intelligent version of the movie, buy the subtitled import. So it's not in English; you'll enjoy the story so much more. I would easily grant the original Japanese version 4, maybe 5 stars. This disgusting oversimplification can only be granted a 2."
2,Adults say: 25 minutes too long,"I have two small boys, and I regularly watch the TV episodes with them. I even like them. (The episodes, that is. I love my boys - for this reason, we saw the movie in the theater.)The ""feature"" portion of this movie is too long - the plot would have been fine in a shorter episode. As it was, it was padded out and I just kept wishing it was over. Plus, Ash gets turned to stone (and comes back to life.) This didn't seem to traumatize my kids - but watch out for anybody that takes this too seriously.The cartoon ""short"" at the beginning is entertaining assuming you can tolerate the lack of dialog. Several times the short is padded with images of dancing pokemon - my kids loved this, I found it nearly pointless. Still, if you like silent films, this might be for you. I liked it better than the feature.If you haven't taken your kids to see this already, you dodged the bullet - don't bother getting your own copy - I'm sure they can watch it at their neighbor's house."
3,"I really like Pokemon, but this movie I don't","I really, really like Pokemon. And I also tryed to like this movie. That didn't work. Don't get me wrong; I understood everything in the movie, its just that it lacks being any fun to watch. The bonus film, Pikachu's Vacation, is not what I would call entertaining; you see Pikachu, Bulbasuar, Squrtile, Psyduck, and Togepi running around a Pokemon amusment park, getting themselves, and a rival Pokemon gang, out of troublesome perdicaments(including getting Pikachu and Raichu loose of each other, getting Charizard's head out of a pipe, and becoming friends). It isn't dramatized or for that matter, anything! The actual movie has Ash and some other trainers going to Mewtwo's Island and then after a little rambling this big(but stupid) Pokemon battle rages out! All and all, it's not that cool of a movie. Be smart: Save your cash for Pokemon:The movie 2000."
5,Pokemon The First Movie Rocks!,"I'm a Pokemon fan, and like all Pokemon fans I went to go see the movie. I was expecting an OK movie. Boy was I wrong!This movie totally blew me away. This is the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life! Even most people who think Pokemon is dumb will love this movie.The storyplot is basically about this Pokemon named Mewtwo who decides all humans are evil after some expieriences with some people who wanted to control him and study him. He calls our heroes to the greatest battle of their life and soon Ash, Misty, Brock, Pikachu, and some other trainers are the only ones who can stop Mewtwo's plans for world domination.Unlike the TV show, this has a much more dramatic and action packed plot. I reccomend it to any person who likes a good movie."
5,Pokemon the First Movie-Mewtwo vs. Mew,The movie dosen't freeze or skips. It's in top form and it's all perfect.
4,The first and nearly the best Pokemon movie,"This movie was voted the worst of 1999 in several on-line polls. Many parents had to endure the movie in theaters as their children watched gleefully. That's pretty much what it boils down to: if you're someone who is not familiar or fond of the world of Pokemon, this movie will bore you to tears... but if you like the show, the movie pushes it to the next level. The movie opens with a 20 minute short featuring the pokemon without their human trainers. Once the short ends you get the story of Mewtwo versus Mew, which is pretty cool and features a lot of nice visuals. With a soundtrack featuring the pop-stars of the time, this movie also feels a bit more ""Americanized"" than most other Poke-features. While Lucario and the Mystery of Mew or Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea might have arguably better stories, this movie seems to zip along the quickest when you watch it."
5,This Movie Inspired me!,"I loved this Movie! It really Inspired me to try Hard, be Nice, work together, have confidence and not fight. I'm 15 years old and am still the BIGGEST pokemon fan. I Highly recommend this to any pokemon fans. I am SOOOOOOOOO happy Pokemon hasn't lost its popularity, because I think it deserves all the love and happiness it shares with everyone else. Get this Movie I Know you'll love it."
4,DVD is the best!,"Pokemon the First Movie on DVD is very cool. All the extra stuff you find out about by watching the features is neat. I do know alot more about Mew and Mewtwo than I originally did, which is cool. I liked the commentary on the movie and all the stuff you learn from it, like all the stuff they considered for the movie. I've heard the Japanese verson was better, but I still like this movie quite a bit."
5,Great movie.,It lacked the comedey of the sieries... but Team rocket wasn't beat. (5 star I LIKE team rocket) Pretty good effects and cool pokemon battles. I'm a true fan now. It's worth the money.
4,It was good but not great,I like the movie but it needed something else. There was not enough action. I also agree with the viewer that said this movie told pokemon not to fight. However what else do they do? The music was nice but not hype. I think that all of Ash's pokemon are cute. Pokemon is over hyped. It's not what people make it. However you can't help but watch the pokemon because their cute !
2,FOR POKEMON FANS ONLY,"THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS,I LOVED POKEMON,AND I LOVED THIS MOVIE,THENI WATCHED IT JUST LAST WEEK AND NOW I DONT LIKE POKEMON AS MUCH AND THOUGHT IT WAS KINDA BORING.SO IF YOU LOVE POKEMON,YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE"
3,Is this DVD?,"I enjoyed viewing the movie in the theater, and give the movie itself 4 stars. However, this release has two drawbacks that keep me from buying it. First, there is not a widescreen format option. I prefer seeing movies as they were intended to be seen, without their sides chopped off and 'pan and scanned'. The second big drawback is the lack of the original japanese audio with english subtitles as an option. I realize that censoring may have made this impossible, but couldn't an uncut version still be released? Without these two major features, there is really no reason why anyone should want to buy the DVD version instead of a VHS version of this film. The technical shortcomings of this release are why I give the release 3 stars instead of 4."
1,"Bad Movie, Japanese Version Better.","Okay, this movie was just so bad I couldn't stand it, the music was awful! The Japanese Version had much BETTER music! The Plot was weaker than the Japanese Version,and they excluded the cards that they sold in the Japanese Version for this movie.I hope they dub Lugia better than this.."
4,Pokemon the First Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back,I thought that this was a great movie for anyone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that I thought it went straight into the plot too fast. Other than that its a movie children of all ages would enjoy.
4,Pokemon: The Movie (Mewtwo Strikes back),"The very First of 3 Pokemon movies. In this movies we finally get to see Mewtwo, and Mew. i thought this was a great film for the Pokemon series. A little darker than the T.V. show though. Basically Mewtwo is created, and he summons the best trainers aroudn to come and battle at his island. The story unfolds there. This video also includes the short film Pikachu's Vaction. It's all about how Pokemon act when humans aren't around"
4,A Good Movie,"This is an O.K movie. I give it a 3.5. It starts out with the origin of Mewtwo, as using DNA from the legendary Pokemon Mew's eyebrow fossil to create a clone, Mewtwo. Soon, Team Rocket leader Giovanni tries to control Mewtwo after he destroys the lab from which he was born in, but Mewtwo has other plans, thinking his purpose is not to serve humans. So he invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to see who can stand up to him. But things get outta control when Mewtwo steals all the Pokemon in black Pokeballs and creates artificial ""Super-Clones"" to prove that clones are the strongest in the universe. But he didn't count on Ash, a young Pokemon Trainer. Ash destroys the cloning machine, thus bringing Mew to the scene and saving the captured Pokemon. Who'll win? The superclones or the originals? Mew or Mewtwo? You've got to see it to beleive it!"
5,This film STILL touches me!!,"I was a huge pokemon fan about 4 years ago when I was 10. Now I'm 14 (wow that was SO long ago lol) and I was REALLY board one day so I sat down and watched this movie, and I'm still touched by it. This movie is a really great film even for former pokemon fans like myself. I SERISLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM"
3,It's..OK.,"It's not nearly as good as the japanese version,not by a long shot.I'm not trying to sound mean or anything,but 4kids really sapped the awesomeness out of it.They took out the prologue,and made Mewtwo seem like a villian. He was just mad because he was created by humans,and not by ""god"".It's also full of aesops,cultural references,and they got certain things wrong,like Pokemon names.However,it's still a classic Pokemon movie."
5,The Best is still the best!!!,Pokemon is my all time favorite anime. No other cartoon comes close to it!!! And this movie puts it on the map! The first movie is the best movie!!!
2,It's ok,"It was great for kids, but it's no Titanic.The Poke'mon'svoices are very annoying, especially for people with a low tolerancefor baby talk. It has a below average story-line.Pikachu's vacation has little stops in it where poke'mon like Magikarp blow bubbles on the screen or talk and this is very irritating for the viewer.It also has an absolutely horrible ending to Mewtwo's revenge. Despite these faults it's a ""BLAST!"" for kids.On a scale of one star to five I gave this a two. For the collector's eye the card is also a waste, unless you really love Mewtwo. Furthermore, your kids will be talking Pikachu for weeks. Take my warning: horrible plot, horrible ending."
4,"Great movie, not wide-screen","Ok, so I'm an adult that uses my daughter as an excuse to enjoy Pokemon, too. =) The features of the DVD are pretty good, behind the scenes, featurettes, and great sound and picture quality.. But a shining disappointment (not that my daughters noticed) was that this was pan & scan, not wide-screen. I did enjoy it, however."
4,A very entertaining anime film,"For fans of the series, they will definitely enjoy the movie. The action was similar to today's action pictures, Mewtwo's performance was outstanding, and the animation was incredible. The film is not for all tastes, but for a fan of anime films this is the movie for you. May I also recommend Princess Mononoke"
1,"Bad: Very, Very Bad.","I had to go see this because it was my grade 7 break-up. This was a depressing movie. Very silly. For the first bit their is no talking, just squeaks. And near the end they try to make it sad by making the main guy die. Don't see it. See something with action and/or a sensible plot."
3,Pokemon the Movie,"Well, I now own the dvd version for my daughter. My daughter who is 6 adored the movie. In my opinion, the cartoon series is better than the However, for the audience it is trying to reach, it does it's job."
4,pokemon: mewtwo strikes back,I went to see this movie in the theaters. I think it would have gotten five stars if they had left out the the sappy cartoon of Pikachus vacation. Hopefully its been left out of the dvd/vhs release.
1,Tired of pokemon,"I hate this movie! I'm tired of pokemon. Pokemon is everywhere! It's so boring. A bad trainer with a ""cute""(just for publicity) pikachu. And pokemon aren't even original. Most of them are humanoids. I hate the tape and I hate pokemon fever. For all the pokemon lovers reading this: Let pokemon rot in hell."
4,Pretty Good DVD But Falls Somewhat Short,this dvd was pretty good but it falls short of its japanese cousin. they did hack the story up a bit but thats to be expected because the coultural diffrences <meouth is a philosopher in japan but a wisecracker in usa>. the extras were great and the commentary was the best ive herd before and that suprised me! i give the japanese virsion 5 stars because of its music its so much better than m2m and blessed union of souls but other than that a great movie. pika! pika!
2,Time to stop the Pokémon craze once and for all,"Ow, this movie's first sequel, ""The Power of One,"" just opened in theatres. But Pokémon been everywhere these past two years! Pokémon this, Pokémon that, Pokémon, Pokémon, Pokémon! Now that there's 100 more (to total 251), oh brother, here we go again. The movie was okay. The song ""Brother, My Brother"" is the best song on the soundtrack. Oh, yeah, Pikachu is cute, but Mew is damn cuter than he, Lugia, and Togepi, my other favorite Pokémon, put together. She would come along and challenge her clone, Mewtwo (who wants to destroy all Pokémon once and for all). What happens, I definitely won't tell.Pokémon, schmokémon! Dragonball Z RULES!"
3,"broken case,scratches on cd",bought this as a gift and was hesitant to do so since the other pokemon new movies are over $100 but the dvd case was in pretty good shape except the inside button which was broken and scratched up the cd either in shipping or before...overall the movie played well up until the end when we had to take it out because it kept skipping.
3,Pokemon DVD #1,"Great feedback from Amazon in informing me on due dates, and my order. DVD (item) was received to me in fantastic condition, and within the time slot given.DVD However will not work in PS3 XBox, and on the dvd player will not play in color. I dont know if that has something to do with where it was made so it doesnt work in Australian DVD players. Or if it is a fault.*** stars.norlu."
2,Only endurable with drugs,"Let's face it: It's a terrible movie. Mediocre animation, stupid songs, awful story and the most rotten moral ever: ""Don't fight"", they say - but what else are Pokémon's good for? The 'best' was the episode before the feature. You have all those Pokémon sudddenly flashing over the screen, colorful backgrounds. No dialoge or story whatsoever. If you're under drugs, this might have the same effect like the lightrays-orgy at the end of '2001' had on some Hippies back in 1968. To sum up: If you like Pokémon, you'll like this movie. If you're a grownup, you won't. It's not even much about liking or not - it's about understanding. Most people just won't get it. And that's a *good* sign!"
2,Almost very annoying.,"I lked ""Pikachu's Vacation"" more than ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"", i give ""Pikachu's Vacation"" ***, while i gave Mewtwo strikes back, *1/2, the result, is **1/2 stars, ""Pikachu's Vacation"" altough it's very simply made it's well done, the only problem withit, is that there is no plot, and no subtitles to know what exactly what the characters are saying, while in ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"", the plot is dumb, they are stone characters, the jokes almost don't work, and well it was VERY ""OVERMADE"", perhaps if the ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"", had a plot about a tournament, better jokes, and more things it would have been far better good. ...if Hayao Miyazaki, or Isao Takhata would have written the story, it would be far better good."
4,Pokemon: The First Extended Episode,"I'm a big pokemon fan, and what better way to see this movie but in Japanese. Granted, this movie is in English, and at times the translation makes no sense whatsoever. Like I said, I saw this movie in Japanese, and the script didn't make much sense either. I think that the translators did a pretty decent job in trying to translate the ""complex plot"" of this movie. So, if you're a fan of pokemon, and you enjoy the cartoon, great, but don't expect something huge."
4,Only 1 disapointment...,"I enjoyed the movie in the theatre (except ""Pikachu's Vacation"" which was just weird). So I bought the DVD. Now, MOST DVDs are either letterboxed or both, but this movie was JUST Pan 'n scan. :-( Other than that, it was very good. (It ain't just for kids.)"
1,Dissapointed,"I disliked this movie to extremes, I am a loyal Pokemon fan, even though I'm afraid to admit it I thought this was a terrible movie, when I bought it on DVD I thought it would be awsome, because I love Pokemon I envited all my friends over to see it, and when the movie was over we just sat there watching the TV, saying: Is that it? I do not recomend this movie to anyone. And to all Pokemon fans out there: Buy the other movies, not this one!"
1,very harsh,Okay firstthings first. They advertised that in the movie you would see all 150 pokemon Not true.And the stupid little movie at the begining pitiful. The movie seemed to be going on and on but not actually going any where. And at the end it to them so long to prove the very basic moral of the story. I have to admit i was abit surprised by the begining when mewtwo escapes that was the only part in the movie where something almost unpredictable hapended. Despite this movie earning 80 million amang the highest for cartoons the movie was HORRIBLE. Many pokemon fans where disapointed with the outcome of this movie.Just a cheap way for billion dollar companies to squeeze all the money they can out of hardworking people.The bottom line is don't even rent this movie.
2,Pokemon their first film,"This movie offers no explanation on what Pokemon are to non-fans.It also uses the characters from a violent show to promote non-violence.Hypocrisy with a captial ""H"".Worst of all,after all is said and done MewTwo wipes the cast's memory away so they forget about what they learned and continue fighting.By the way,I'm I the only one who thinks Mewtwo is a lame name for a clone for another pokemon named Mew.Talk about lazy!The characters in the show have little to no personality what so ever.The only good thing about this film is the animation itself but it's still not worth it. I give this film a 2 out of 10."
1,Not Up to Par,One pf the disapointing movies of the Fall. Pokemon is only for pre- teens and younger the movie was REALLY BAD! DON'T WATCH ITPOKEMON F PIKACHUS VACTION D+
3,It was good (I rated it out of 4 stars not 5),"A lot of people are comparing it to the TV show or the japan ese version of the film. My review is re viewing the Movie by itself. Here we go. I give the short, Pikachu's Vacation 3 out of 4 Stars. It was great perfect superb. But, alas, only the really good film really deserve 4 stars(ie Star Wars or Titanic) As for mew two strike back it gets the same. and for the same reason. Well if you like heart warming stories with lots of action. This is for you.Also, If you put different characters in this same plot it would be loved by even more people. The only reason it got such a bum rap is because of poke-haters."
1,Lame!,I never liked Pokemon.And i don't think the movies are that entertaining.I think that people that made Pokemon are imbeciles.And no i do not recommend this movie.
1,Too little,"This video is more or less only for Pokemon fanatics. I tried watching the film, but by the time Pikachu's Vacation rolled around, and those annoying pokemon appearing in the most annoying places (an entire screen is dedicated to a dancing Pysduck, or Farfetched). It has practily no plot, and the original focus about the Togepi now shifts to this idiot Charizard who gets his head stuck in a tube. Now, on to the actual movie. 55 minutes? Warner, try and do better. Try 1 hour, 30 minutes at least. Mewtwo sounds like an American Businessman, the C-G-I dosen't blend together with the animation like it should, and the much-vaunted ""The Story of Mewtwo's origins"" is like 30 seconds long, with this guy saying: ""We are in the woods"" for the whole time. My favorite part of the movie actually is the teaser for the next movie. Not a good sign."
1,The Lousiest Movie on Earth,"If you are planning to buy this DVD, don't! It's a total waste of money. This was obviously just to make more money. In fact, Pokemon the Movie is a pathetic flop. Even Mission Impossible 2, which is also bad, would be better."
3,"Nice for kids, average DVD","The very successful animation series has got his first movie. Ithink this movie is great for kids and almost all the kids will loveit. But besides children there are very few people who like Pokemon and will appreciate this movie. The animation of the movie is the same as in the series and it's some sort of a long edition of a pokemon episode. And it doesn't have a real story so you must really like and know the Pokemon characters to understand and like the movie.And the DVD is very average, especially the picture and sound quality isn't that good. The extra features on this disc are pretty good and are one of the better things on this DVD. And there is also a trailer on it with the second pokemon movie that will come out next summer. But the reason I gave 3 stars is that kids will love it and will watch it many times. It's also nice for other people who like pokemon, but that are probably the only people who will like this movie and so the DVD."
3,I'm glad the Pokemon craze is dying down.,"And it's about time. This movie is about Mewtwo, a clone of the super-rare Pokemon Mew (she's our favorite!), and he wants to take over the world. It's just like an episode of the TV series in two parts, or maybe three. First, you've got this ""Pikachu's Vacation"" with Marril and Snubble, two out of 99 new Pokebrats, and the apparently short film itself. Two new Pokemon movies are going to be released within the next two or three years. But because the Pokemon craze is dying out once and for all, those movies may not follow in the wake of the success of this one."
4,Great movie!,"The little movie at the beginning about Pikachu's Vacation is adorable and GREAT for little kids. However, you may want to wait on the actual movie until they are a little bit older, my 6 year old son found it a little bit scarey when the Mewtwo story line started."
3,Too Different,"This movie just wasn't very much like the Pok'emon series. The first time I saw it, I didn't care for it at all. Good music, and some exciting parts, but that's pretty much it. To make a good movie, it has to be like the original series, and I've found that most Pok'emon movies aren't."
5,a great movie.,"I saw this movie when it came out. It wasn't a big deal till I saw it again now that I'm older. I saw this on cratoonetwork out of boredom and I began to understand The big picture of the movie. In the show it has lessons about working together. This movie has many lessons.1.working together2.accepting others. All people are different.3. violence dosen't solve anything. We shoulden't use violece to solve our hatered toward others. Thats what mewtwo learns in the movie.Critics said the movie was awful which is why my parents really didn't want to see this. well, they mustive cared more about how violent it was than the lessons. This movie gives kids alot to learn.yeah, can you belive 4 kids ebtertainment did this? yep the worst dubbers ever! I think they did a pretty good job FOR ONCE!"
5,"Powerful, but missing a bit","First, I'll confess that I'm a 35 year-old Pikachu addict -- I can't explain it, and I've stopped bothering to try. If you like Pokemon at all, you'll love this film -- it has all the familiar characters and has a very powerful storyline.However: The Japanese version of this movie was considerably longer, and much of it was cut for the U.S., including and explanation of Pokemon and Trainers, scenes with other Mewtwos dying because of failures by the scientists, and a better explanation of what the heck Mew is doing.Still, very good. If you don't know Pokemon, try the first in the video series, ""Pikachu, I Choose You!"" and find out for yourself what an adult can possibly like about it!"
3,They're coming back...,"...uh, now focus goes to Mewtwo, a clone of the super-rare Pokemon Mew, and he wants to take over the world. And our heroes have to stop him. Pokemon the Movie 2000 hopefully has to be better than this stuff, but who wants to catch them all, anyway?"
4,Pretty pink but pale....,Earrings were pretty....Again the size in the photo is deceiving. So watch out for the dimension which is exactly what you get. It is shown as a bright pink. It is not that pink.
1,Doesn't Work on New Systems,I bought an earlier version of Topo on DVD. I was satisfied with it but then I upgraded to Windows XP and my DVD will no longer work. Delorme doesn't support the older version and suggests I buy a new one at full price. They didn't offer a lower cost upgrade. So beware if you buy this software. It may not work with Microsoft's next OS upgrade!
1,Delorme Topo Products,I purchased Topo USA 3 and was very disappointed with the maps and the features. Delorme does not use maps that are even close to USGS topos. I would not recommend any of their mapping products. For the best in real USGS maps get MapTech's Terrain Navigator. It does all the things Delorme products do and it uses REAL USGS 1:24000 Topos.
1,3D Feature does not work,"Don't buy this product if you want the 3D feature! It simply does not work, and tech support has been awful/non-existent. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this..."
4,A useful tool,I used this software to help plan a recent backpacking trip with my GPS (I have a Garmin 76S which it works well with) and found it very useful. ... for the entire country is a pretty good deal in my opinion but I did not expect miracles. It has decent detail but is not a substitute for a detailed map of where you are going. I also use this software for making maps of local trails which it does a good job at.I did not have any of the problems listed by other reviewers - after I downloaded the patch from delorme.Also - Delorme will sell USGS maps and satellite pictures compatible with this software. I think the USGS was about .../state. I downloaded free samples of both and they were pretty good (the USGS map looked a little like it had been scanned in but it was still very legible).It does leave you a little bit on your own on how to figure out how to use it but I was able to figure most things out fairly easy on my own and the help topics covered the rest.
2,Disappointed,"Initially I thought this was some great software, but once I started trying to do more advanced things I quickly saw the limitations of this software. Like another reviewer said, the routing is almost unusable. I guess if you aren't a hiker you might like this software. I should have gone with my gut feeling and bought Maptech."
1,THE AMERICANS DON'T GIVE UP.,"It hurts; It causes pain; The word Hellenism (or Greece) and everything that surrounds it causes panic and now they have put pseudoprofessors like this guy to write another trash under the veil of ""scholar objectivity""."
1,ANOTHER SHAMEFUL STUPIDITY!!!!,"This is the most popular issue that the American propaganda has put on target:""Degrade the Macedonian Hellenic history in every way you can""."
5,Renaissance Thought and its Sources,"This is one of the most important books in the study of Italian Renaissance (14th-16th century). For those who would like a readable but scholarly introduction to the Renaissance, this is it. The book is intended to explain the intellectual origin, spiritual inspiration and mental struggles of the great Renaissance scholars and artists. My professor once said to my class "" this book is worth its weight in gold!"" Though that might be a slight exageration, the book is certainly a worthwhile read. This book is one of the rare academic but mind racing, heart pounding books that one cannot put down until finish. Don't let the scholarliness intimidate you, push yourself to read it and you will see what I mean."
2,Not his best,"I have been a Meatloaf fan since I first stated to listen to music. In fact, he was my first (and current) favorite artist. This album is a bit of a dissapointment. Although he has had many songs I just haven't enjoyed, as a whole, every one of his albums has been very enjoyable... until now. In fact, I really only liked one song on this whole album. The music was just a little hard and loud and just didn't have that musical, ""operaetic"" feel that most of his great song do. It was hard to even hear him sing on several songs due to the instraments being way too loud. I just pray he doesn't retire on this one."
1,Alternate title: BAD Out Of Hell!,"""Clever"" song titles do NOT translate to a great album. Shallow,""radio-friendly"" fluff that is light years away from the blindingbrilliance and excitement of Meat Loaf's work with Steinman. Allin all it would've made a terrific project for Pat Boone."
1,Why oh why?,"This is not a good album. I am a huge fan of Jim Steinman and his music and the way Meatloaf gets the messages across. Meatloaf's amazing voice and stage presence are un-Paralleled. I usually enjoy Meat's non Steinman albums (such as this one is), because they try and are usually very good imitations of the Steinman albums (Bat I & II, Dead Ringer) but he totally missed here. James Michael who wrote the main tracks, is off the mark as is the Production. The songs have no climax no catchy refrains and seem to go nowhere. His last non-Steinman album was ""Welcome To The Neighborhood""... not a masterpiece but enjoyable tracks like ""Where The Rubber Meets The Road"", ""I'd Lie for You..."" & ""Martha"". Sadly there are very few if any songs on here that you would even want to listen to twice. Upsetting that I have to write this but true... But not to worry, it appears Steinman is ready to work with the big guy again, and Bat III could be out as soon as 2005!!!"
2,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...","First, there was ""Midnight at the Lost & Found"". Meat makes an album without Steinman, and I buy it only to find it s*cks. Later, out comes ""There Goes the Neighborhood"". A couple of songs by Steinman, maybe it's worth the money... NOPE!! The rest of the album was a waste of time. Once again, there is only ONE winning formula. Meat Loaf & Steinman. There is no Steinman on ""Couldn't Have Said It Better"". You have been forewarned. To the reviewers who said that it is better than other new releases - Just because the standards for modern music have lowered immeasurably, doesn't mean Meat Loaf should lower his!"
5,Amazing!!!!,"Meatloaf has surpassed himself again. Another CD, I love it from start to finish!! Favorites - Man of Steel; Testify; Beacuse of You; You're Right I was wrong; Never mind.. I love the whole CD. The instrumental intermezzo is amazing.. i just wish it was longer. We just saw him in Concert in September and he did a couple of tracks from this album ... I hope its not the last time I see him in concert.. still a die hard fan since 1978. Thank you Meatloaf for filling my life with fantastic music that has so much meaning and always seems to fit whats happening to me at that time! This IS BIG TIME, this IS LARGER THAN LIFE!"
5,Amazing!!!,I have always been a Bat out of Hell fan. But after going to his latest concert... and heard a few of the new songs on this latest CD... I had to buy it. Some of the songs are so catchy and raises the blood pressure... I can't get them out of my head..!! Russo does an awesome job.. again! Couldn't Have Said It Better Myself and Man of Steel are unbelievable! I'll never understand why his songs aren't played on the radio more.
3,"It's OK, but not ""MEAT LOAF-ian""","I own 2 copies of the German import. It's a good CD that I listened to in April-May 2003. If you like Meat Loaf songs, it has 5 or so good tracks. There are NO STEINMAN songs on here...so there's no comparison to the BIG MEAT LOAF-ian songs.If you like ML, buy this CD."
3,"Couldn't Have Said it Better""","I liked the music, it was great. It's a lot different than when he worked with Jim Steinman. I liked Jim Steinman's songs better, but Meat Loaf did a good job with this. But most of the songs on here are love songs with the exception of one or two. I looked in the little book that comes with it and it said that there's use of a sythesizers and drum programings and I think that it's just lame to use those. Like other's have said, this is more grown up them previous albums. The other albums like Bat Out of Hell was deep and dark, so much feeling and life in it. Powerful, I guess. This album was just kind of like he had grown up and became serious. The other albums were young, loud and pounding if that makes any sense to anyone. Jim Steinman's songs sounded like they were willing to say anything just as long as they got a point across to you. But I am still a fan no matter what and I still like the album."
2,Very different,"To the person that mentioned Jim Steinman's lack of involvement with the album, I agree. Without the genius' magic touch, Meat loaf has come out with an awfully shabby album. The title song ""Couldn't have said it betterr myself"" offers a slight zing to the album. But when listening to the rest of the album, it is very disappointing. Steinman and Meat Loaf are the ultimate duo. But when one is taken away, it is noticeable. I would not reccommend this album."
3,It Has Been Said Better,"I have to agree with the majority when they say that without Jim Steinman, something is missing. This album is reminiscent of Welcome To the Neighborhood and less like either Bat Out Of Hell I or II. Gone are the rock ballads that described love at its finest. This album focuses on the pain of love lost, like what I consider the best song on this album, Man Of Steel, by using a soft rock approach. This CD is in no way bad, it just isn't in the same ballpark as any of his older stuff, mainly the albums with Steinman."
4,Meat Loaf is always satisfying!,"Unlike some of the reviewers, I wouldn't say ""Couldn't Have Said It Better"" is not greater than ""Bat Out Of Hell"" (1 or 2) but it is certainly a worthy album (better than most of the dreck put out these days). The songs are rocking and driving when they need to be, a soulfully haunting when they need to be. That is the true power of Meat Loaf! The man has two great styles to draw upon. Theatrical? Sure. Dramatic? Of course. I wouldn't expect any less from the man.A good album to add to your collection. 12 songs (including the hidden track) plus two music videos for the regular price of a CD? I'll take it!"
5,The Loaf Rises,"Meat Loaf returns after a 8 year recording hiatus with his best work since 1977. The title track Couldn't Have Said it Better is like the Meat Loaf of old, the song of the year in my books. Also the emotionaly charged Did I Say That and Why Isn't That Enough show a much matured Meat still vocally perfect only more somber. Then there's the great song's like You're Right I Was Wrong and Love You Out Lous that make this record solid all around no filler at all. Meat Loaf also has a duet with daughter Pearl that starts simple and ends with everything thrown in. Meat Loaf's closes the record with a message to his fans with the Bob Dylan cover Forever Young.He just Couldn't Have Said It Better!!!!!!"
3,meat's voice in fine form,"Jim's other worldly songwriting ability is missing, but Meat's vocals are dead on. I just discovered this album, and I'm enjoying it very much!"
2,I just don`t understand.,"If i could ask meat loaf one question: why do u waste time and effort making new records without jim steinman. ok so he's a weird dude and maybe you don't get along all that great. Whatever that seems insignificant when you really consider what meat and jim is capable of. I mean it seems like a no brainer when something works so well don't screw it up. Sorry but this and all other loaf albums without jim, i just feel like are such a waste. Should have known better than to buy this cd and it not say ""songs by jim steinman"" on the cover, won't make that mistake again.."
3,Not his best,"I have all of Meat Loaf's c.d.s and love them all,but this one is not his best. Songs are not as griping as his last one's. Think twice before buying."
5,Great Book,"The author not only discusses the anomalies we find in religion, but gives us insight of the 16 principal Odus, and her explanations of Ifa spirituality are unsurpassed in clearness and logic. If you are confused and looking for a knowledgeable guide to this religion this is what you need. This book is impeccable and this book is truly useful."
2,Absolut Regurgitation,"While it includes several amusing anecdotes, such as the origin of Marlboro Man's tattoo, ""Twenty Ads That Shook the World"" is disappointing. The analysis surrounding the rather obviously chosen ads in the book is largely regurgitated from Twitchell's otherwise superb Adcult USA. Sadly, despite the Wired-esque fluorescent pink and yellow dust jacket, Mr. Twitchell also manages to completely miss the Internet and its effect on advertising.Readers interested in the collision commercialism and society should opt for Twitchell's earlier ""Adcult USA,"" while students of advertising can find deeper insights about what makes ads tick in Judith Williamson's ""Deconstructing Advertisements.""Has Twitchell become, as David Ogilvy would put it, an extinct volcano? I certainly hope not - but this book makes me wonder."
4,Interesting but seems Outdated,"It's hard to say what makes a good ad. Is it humor? Memorability (yeah, I know that's not really a word. So sue me!)? Clarity?The book talks about a lot of different types of ads, including some very old ones such as for Pear's Soap. That was particularly interesting to a layperson such as myself.However, it didn't cover Wendy's ""Where's the Beef?"" or anything from Alka-Seltzer, both of which are very memorable - and the Wendy's ad cropped up during a Reagan-Mondale debate in 1984!I would also have liked to have seen some more recent trends covered, such as the MTV style of advertising, or the ironic/nasty ads (e. g. for rental cars companies that show accidents).A good read, but could use a makeover."
5,great read,"Twenty Ads That Shook the World is a great history lesson for those interested in learning about the past, and the ads that were well-known (or in some cases, not so well-known) throughout the last several decades. I highly recommend making this book a purchasing decision- you won't regret it."
5,Interesting and Entertaining!!,"This book is truely great. I couldn't put it down! As an Advertising major, this book succeeded all of my expectations. From the De Beers ""A Diamond is Forever"" campaign to the ""Marlboro Man"", this book is truely a fun, interesting and entertaining look into our past, our current pop-culture and the ads that changed our lives. Great Read!"
1,Fitz-All does not fit all,"Product probably fits lots of ""threaded"" control stems but it does not fit ""slotted"" control stems on appliances like box fans. Definately not fits-all."
1,They don't fit all.,"I have a wonderful toaster oven for the absent minded - you need to set a dial each time you use it, so you can't leave it on. The rod the knob attaches to is split (for a tight compression fit) and there are two screw heads in the area covered by the knob. The depth of the rod cover part of these knobs is woefully inadequate - so they are useless for this appliance."
3,"Fantastic show, not-so fantastic DVD!",Weller deserves better than this when it comes to capturing him live on film. THE CAMERA JUST MOVES AROUND TOO MUCH! You need motion sickness tablets in order to watch it!
4,"Great performance, good dvd","I agree the video editing was a little overdone, but I didn't find it too anoying. Unbelievable number of songs in one performance. Its hard to believe this guy is pushing 50. He still rocks and rocks well. Sound quality was good, but not up to the standards of some of the better Live DVD performances like the Eagles ""Hell freezes over"". Still, I find myself watching this DVD over and over. I enjoyed the old Jam and Style Council songs as well. Not his best band line-up. Bassist Damon Minchella is a little weak and the keyboard player looks like Herman Monster. Check out LIVE WOOD if you want to hear the best band he ever put together live. But that video suffered even worse from the fast camera shots and choppy editing. Still can't believe this guy isn't a big star in the US. Most people have never heard of him. Shame."
3,Love the show but the camera changes are too much...,"Paul Weller's work is amazing on this DVD. The photgraphy is very good too, but the constant change in camera angle is beyond annoying. I can't watch it. The editor really messed up what could have been a great piece. The camera changes would be ok if there were periods of time where it let up... it doesn't.More like 2seconds and under for the camera changes...."
3,"Good performance, crisply shot, but put on your seat belts!",".Weller and his sidemen put on a nice career survey here, including not just his solo work, but also some Jam and Style Council. Everybody is in fine form: Weller never wrote melodies which tax the vocal range, so he doesn't really do any short cuts on high notes or go flat; Weller's guitar work isn't brilliant, but certainly good enough; great drums, too, and songs also work well when Weller plays the piano. I have to repeat others' complaints about the constant, frequent switching of cameras: it produces a feeling of vertigo after awhile, and you'd like less of it. Not only do the camera angles switch too frequently, but there's one song where the director has chosen to have the cameras to fast zooms on their focal points. It's a fine show to have on ""in the room,"" but if you watch it for any length it gets difficult. And I can't see why anyone would spend money on a DVD for the background."
3,"Musically Weller; however, tough to watch","If your reason to purchase this DVD is to hear Paul Weller live, great. If you what to watch Paul live, be brave. With all the fast edits it is hard to get a real sense of the concert. Each frame seems to last no more than 4 seconds. That makes watching a muscian solo or interact with other bandmates difficult to see. What you do see is a blur of close ups, far shots and quick crowd scenes. A persons best bet is to get a live audio recording of Paul. The other live video is directed better, purchase that one."
4,Live at Braehead,"Despite what I usually say in reviews, this concert has a great new version of a Style Council song ""Down in the Seine."" (+ Man of great Promise), and the Jam regular reprises.""It's written in the Stars"" is the hilight of a great concert for me.I also loved ""Peacock Suit"" and ""Picking up sticks"""
5,nice tabs - easy to apply,The package includes tabs for all of the books of the bible. Many others do not include tabs for the books that were omitted from Protestant bibles.
2,Tabs Don't Stick,"Though I like the tabs themselves, the last sheet of tabs completely fell apart and would not stick to my bible pages. Having to order another set to complete my bible and pay shipping to Canada is a waste of my hard earned money."
4,Does the Job,Nice tabs for Catholic Bible. Also matched the Bible Timeline for those attending Bible Training Great Adventure. Such as Bible Timeline and/or new testament. Slighly more that regular inde tabs
2,Bible Indexing Tabs: Great Adventure,I found these tab directions hard to understand and hard to put into my Bible so I didn't use them.
1,Bible Indexing Tabs,I am not happy with these lables at all; they were a waste of my money. I have not even attached them to my Bible and more than likely will not. They are of very low quality and I could have done better by visiting my local office store and purchasing higher quality tabs and making them myself!
5,Bible Tabs,"What's not to like about tabs in your study Bible. There were a few tabs that weren't appropriate in the Bible I purchased them for, but they did work in another Bible that already had tabs in them, just not for a few of the sections."
3,Pretty Good,"Relatively easy to use, but a little tricky aligning all of the top tabs, all of the 2nd tabs, etc. I also wish that they had more ""generic"" tabs (Notes, Glossary, etc)."
1,Small plant not even close to 9 inches,This is a really small bonsai. Not worth the money I have spent including the shipping. This one is close to 5 inches including the pot. The plant itself is close to 2.5 inches.I want the money back on this item.If I could rate it with NO stars I would have.
3,"Packaging, ship time and price were good","The Juniper Bonsai specimen was sub par! All the pictures they show look great, they all appear to have potential and ready to shape and care for. The one I received will need at least two seasons before its in decent shape. My stem goes up out of the mound approx. 1/2 "" then goes into a 180 degree turn it looks like the number one (1) fell over, also it has a reverse Mohawk (flat and bare on top). It looks like it was planted and all starter growth happened with a dictionary laid on top of it. I know how to fix it, but they advertise a well started healthy specimen. This buyer strikes out with me, now that I have the product the price is too high and good packaging/ shipping doesn't cut it."
2,Not an indoor plant!!,"I got this as a gift for my husband, and didn't realize until it arrived that it is an OUTDOOR plant and can't be kept inside! I'm not into gardening and plants, and this never crossed my mind. However, it would have been helpful for this to be pointed out (I don't think I saw this anywhere, but maybe I didn't look close enough). The plant was beautiful when it arrived, no complaints there at all."
3,Ok for the price,"Smaller than I expected. I got it as a gift for my brother who loved it, but I was less impressed. It looks less like a bonsai and more like a tiny bush. But my brother loves it, so that's all that matters"
2,Description should state it is strictly for outdoor use,Description should state it is strictly for outdoor use. Packaging material states it can remain indoors for only 5 days.
1,Juniper Bonsai...TINY,The description on this item says it's 3 years old and 9 inches tall...the one that arrived is 5.5 inches at it's highest point (including the container). The tree itself is just under 3 inches tall. It is a pretty tree but not at all as described. I would return it except that I don't have time to get another in time for Christmas but I am very disappointed.
1,"Dull, Predictable, and Nothing Original","Wow! Was this book bad. Not only am I in the film industry, but I'm a huge fan of horror. So I thought this book would be perfect for me. Unfortunately, with little to no character development or atmosphere, this book is dead on arrival. I have to say, Scream Queen is the most predictable horror novel I've ever read. Every single scene I've seen done before. The author also makes quite a few mistakes when describing positions on a film crew. It's no wonder Mr. Van Belkom got his technical information about filmmaking from Ron Oliver -- the director of Prom Night III ! I also found it funny to learn that this author has written books on how to write horror and erotica when this book contains neither! Scream Queen is a total flop and a complete waste of time. Stay away."
4,IS this still in production?,"I purchased this first about 4 years ago. At that time, it was only $16+. By mid-2011, it was already $19.99And now??? $28 !!!Neutrogena's own website does not carry this product. Seems that it has been discontinued. If so, are those being offered here safe to use?"
4,Neutrogena Night Cream,"This is a ""must have product"" for my wife. She swears this is the only stuff that will keep her pretty face looking young. If it makes her happy, I will continue shopping for it, but the price keeps getting higher and higher and higher! Please,Please,Somebody find a way to sell this for a better price. I did say ""Please""!!!!"
4,The only one I'll use.,"After years of buying the wrong moisturizers, I bought this after reading Leslie Baumann's Skin Type Solution book. I haven't used other moisturizers since.I have very dry skin which is very sensitive; many moisturizers irritate my skin. This cream doesn't. Because it's a night cream it provides good moisture, but feels very light. If you're looking something heavy or greasy, this isn't it."
4,I like it,"My skin seems to be better than before - better tone, wrinkles may be a bit less too. Goes on well. Smells nice ... I use it almost every night."
5,Very pleased with this product,"Have been using this product for approximately a week and have already seen a reduction in the puffiness under one eye that nothing else seemed to help, and also smoother skin. I've used Retin-A for years (and still do), but this product is a great addition to my regimen. Like another reviewer, I researched information on Copper Peptides and found that they are restorative/an aid in healing. If my initial results continue, I will make this product a permanent part of my routine."
2,"Did not like this product at first, but seeing results now","I love most Neutrogena products (adore the tinted ones) but did not like the feel of this one initially (did not seem silky)so I pitched it into the trash. Retrieved it later and used it a couple more days and noticed that my face does look plumper and moist. It's a thick cream that forms a nice barrier on the skin. Skin does look better and fuller and I'm using it daytime and nightime now, but I cannot undo the two-star rating or I would now give it a five."
2,See no changes,"I Found this product heavy on the skin.Have used it for a month now, and there is not the least changes of my skin."
1,I do not think it worked,I do not think it worked. There was no difference after using it for about a month.
3,Fading Memory,Though there are great songs on this disc the fact that it cannot be copied has relegated it to a dust collector for me. No offence to Morrissey & his collection but I prefer to adjust tracks on a compilation to my liking. As I cannot do this due to the no copy encryption I'm less likely to re-visit the disc very often.
5,Great songs and playing... a wonderful collection!,"This is a brand new special release and though I have not had the chance to purchase this ""Deluxe Edition"" yet, I am very familiar with the original release of ""Turning Point"" and Martin's first CD that the great bonus tracks for this edition were taken from. Martin plays in a variety of styles, has great tone and feeling in his playing and songs that will emotionally move you. I highly recommend this CD to any fan of acoustic guitar music."
3,not worth the price,"I hope you haven't bought these yet. I purchased a pair of these Gold Ring 10x32 for myself and tried them next to my Nikon 10x42 ATB [...]. I believe that my Nikons have these beat. I'm next considering the Leupold Katmai Green Ring, they are much much less expensive....check [...]. But first I'll buy the Vortex 10x32 Spitfires for just [...]. My wife and I watch birds and travel often so I want something small, powerful, and durable. The Gold Rings also appear pretty heavy for a 32mm objective lens, maybe it's the HD glass. The adjustment knobs were very difficult to rotate and the eye-piece covers are cheap. Again, the Leupold Golden Rings are not worth the price."
5,"I agree this is a great Dan Bern CD, but download it for far less","I agree with the previous review and this is probably my favorite Dan Bern CD. Lord knows, I have 'em all, including the download-only EPs. The price for the CD is kind of preposterous, considering you can download this elsewhere on amazon for less than nine bucks. So if you are able, I'd recommend downloading it and then burning to CD. It's a two-CD release, so you may have to play around to find where CD1 ends and CD2 begins. I'm all-mp3, so it's moot for me.This guy is one of the truly great overlooked artists of our time! Spread the word!"
1,Se jodieron a mi hermanito,escribo es ya que mi hermanit.o es muy bonito y debido a esto lo estafaron
1,Alley Oop not by V. T. Hamlin,"This Alley Oop book is not by V. T. Hamlin, but by Dave Graue. Hamlin was dead, and the comic was being drawn by Graue. To represent this book as being by V. T. Hamlin is dishonest and fraudulent."
3,It is ok but not the best,"Like some other programs, you have to guess the meaning of the pictures, it is fine with sample pictures but with more complicate situations, people guess differently, so they suppose to speak different words?If it had pictures and words,include dictionary and explanations, that would be perfect."
4,Using Rosetta Stone,Very difficult to get started as every move offers multiple options. It is like the never ending story.
5,No other way!,"This is more like playing a game than work, and the information sticks with you! You don't even realize you're learning so much with the tiered system, but you put it all together in the end and it's easy!"
3,Setting and Action,"King is the master of setting, and this short novel is in an alluring time and place, both of which are mysterious. The main characters of ""white"" and ""black"" are initially intriguing. However, this book fails in its details.While King is great at setup, I find him awful at action where he over-indulges his descriptions and metaphors. Almost every scene of tension was broken unintentionally with his overly dramatic prose, and this gets very frustrating."
3,THE SLOWEST KING BOOK EVER!,"I have been told and so many of the reviews have stated that this is the most difficult book of the Tower series to get through. That's an understatement. I've plodded through it however, trying to absorb the content enough to have a basis for what I understand are much greater books to follow in this series. I tried reading this when it first came out and put it down quite quickly as it was so dull. I've now managed to get through it on tape and am relieved it's over. I realize it's the foundation for the rest of the series, but I wish I could have skipped it. If the next in the series is this droll, I'll have to eliminate these works from my King favorites. Struggle through it and perhaps you'll enjoy it more than I did."
4,The End of the Beginning,"The Dark Tower isn't a typical Steven King read. It's more The Stand-esque in that it isn't much of a horror book. It incorporates minimal horror elements (I'm sure King couldn't help it), but plays out like an adventure or even a fantasy novel. It's an enticing read that makes you hunger for more of what King has to offer with the series. Unlike a lot of King's other works, this one isn't really dense and somewhat hard to put down once you start reading. The opening of the book is slow, but it really picks up around the middle of the first part. Also, the illustrations are very aesthetically pleasing. My only complaints with this book are the afforementioned slow opening and the somewhat overuse of foreshadowing. But other than those 2 flaws, the book is a solid read and makes you want to read the other 6 books."
3,A bit vague,"The problem with this book is that it seems to start in the middle of a story with no idea whats really happening. We get the idea of the gunslinger chasing the man in black but we don't know why or for how long. The story seems to gain some substance as it progresses; the gunslinger meeting the boy Jake and the events on their journey provide some story line to follow. It is only in the series' suceeding books (the drawing of three, the wastelands) that we get an overall picture of whats happening. The series is like one big jigsaw; instead of a flowing storyline, the story jumps around from the present to the gunslingers past. King is one of the few writers who can do this successfully. Even though I found it hard to follow the first book, the following in the series are excellent and I would definitly recommend them, even though it is necessary to read the first book in order to follow the storyline. A bit of a tough read, but worth it in order to follow the rest of the series."
4,Why it works......,"I read this sometime after it came out, back in the day when word of mouth was probably the best way to find a good read. This qualified immediately.There's a reason that this book worked for me. I think every American my age (40's) was exposed to the cowboy myth while growing up. This book expanded the myth into a legend. It was the first (and to date only) ""western fantasy/supernatural"" novel, though it was predated by ""High Planes Drifter"" which has the same tone.Roland struck me as a fully developed character. The author knew who he was, but exposed him almost miserly. This kept the interest and tension high through out the book.I would highly recommend this for anyone who is looking to blend the cowboy myth and fantasy."
3,"A Great Series, but Mediocre Book","I'm a big fan of Stephen King's writing, and as the Dark Tower series is his magnum opus, I love the books. That said, however, this first book was the worst. Although the story is captivating and chocked full of foreshadowing, the prose itself is cheap and stilted. In some parts, it reads like a fiction-mill fantasy novel, overfilled with adjectives and description. Still, if you plan on reading the rest of the series (which I highly recommend), this book is a necessary stop."
3,Tough Read - Excellent Series,"As I was reading The Gunslinger, I never thought I'd make it through, let alone continue on to reading Drawing of the Three. The Gunslinger, however, is necessary to establish several key areas that are expanded upon in the later books of The Dark Tower Series. Wizard and Glass, has been my favorite of the series (which I would give 5 stars, and the rest, probably 4 stars each), but just wouldn't make sense as a stand-alone novel.I would think of The Gunslinger as ""eating your vegitables in order to get to dessert."""
2,Bland and overrated on its own merits,"Don't get me wrong, this book is an easy read and you will be turning the pages trying to get the story to develop. But it doesn't in this book. As I've been told, taken as a part of the whole series, the book may be good. But I believe that even in a series, each of the books should stand on its own merits. Dune, for example, was a great book individually and as part of the greater Dune series. Gunslinger is rather inadequate in this regard. There is a thin veneer of a story and it frankly doesn't progress any more than a one sentence summary couldn't have sufficed.So, if you are willing to consider this book a 300pg preface to the series, you may enjoy it (I haven't gotten to 2 and not sure if I want to after this). If you think a series should consist of reasonably self-contained stories with an overall plot arc that runs through each ""episode"", you most likely will be disappointed with Book 1.To each their own."
3,bad condition,It arived in bad condition but its a great book. Anyone looking for a great series to read should start here.
3,Not as good as I'd thought it would be.,"Considering all the hype and talk about this series, I was expecting this book to be a lot better. I've since read the second and third books and I think the series does get better (the third is my favorate so far). Still, I can't see why it's garnered such support when there are a lot of books out there just as good, if not better. Roland is a good character, but sometimes I think some of the reviewers here have never read anything but a Stephen King book. ""The Gunslinger"" is not bad but overrated."
2,Weak Start for an Epic Series,This review is based on the original version. In my mind this is a very weak book. I found it very difficult to get through and disjointed. Having said that if you can make it to the second one you will be rewarded for the time invested in this one. The series just keeps getting better and better. King does a great job in making you care about Roland and his Ka-Tet. I have loved this series from the 2nd book to finish. You just have to make it through the first one.
3,MUST READ,For King- this series is his best.Get all the books in this series.For an Average writer- this is his epoch.
2,Young Stephen King fumbles his way into an epic,"This was a disappointing book. Although people complain about Stephen King's need for an editor, I think he works best with 800-page novels. This one is too short. Roland the gunslinger is interesting, but his backstory isn't. I enjoyed reading about his adventures in the town of Tull, but I laughed reading about being trained by a tough old Yoda-guy in a castle. And why does Roland love the boy? There's no explanation. He just DOES. Surprisingly, the story picks up at the end. The train in the mountain and the mutants are good. So is the conversation with the man in black. It ends suddenly, but with a promise that the next installment in the series will be much better."
2,Very slow read...Never even made it all the way through.,This book was very boring. Most of the time you couldn't even tell what was going on or where the characters were. The time period was jumping all over the place and made the story confusing. The only reason people rate this book high is because of the author. If it was anybody else this book would have bombed!
1,"Slow, disorganized, plodding read","I am currently half way through The Gunslinger. I have heard that the rest of the Dark Tower Series is a lot better than the first book because there is a 30-something year difference between the first two books. This is the only reason that I'm reading this one. Otherwise I would say that it is a waste of money. Stephen King wrote this when he was 19 years old and the book has a preface that is basically a long, drawn-out apology for this fact. It seems that even the author knows that this book sucks in comparison to the rest. I can't wait to finish it so I can move on to the others.For a cleverer and faster read, try the Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, instead. He is a much better writer in general and the plots are so intriguing that one can breeze through a 1000+ page book in a matter of days. They are so good that you will probably start to neglect your job, home, children, etc. So read with caution!"
2,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I enjoyed EYES OF THE DRAGON, ON WRITING & several of his horror/thrillers.But this novel didn't work for me: I believe the beginning of a story should pack some punch in the first 40 pages or it will lose people, who have better choices.Such was the choice with DARK TOWER; talk of grits and the cowboyand gateways only held my interest for so long."
3,Great Storytelling...,"...Poor story. Stephen King is one of the better story tellers of our time. His plots, however, are often times lacking. He can take you to the end of a book without a clear story line, entertaining you all the way, but then drops you off wondering where you are and what just happened.I would recommend getting through this book (and it does have its moments) so that you can get into the middle of the series, where most of the meat of The Dark Tower is. If you have a lot of time to devote and don't mind reading 300+ pages (especially later on) with absolutely no advancement in plot but enjoyable story telling, then go for it. Otherwise you may want to stick with something more solid or less lengthy."
5,AAAAAAAAAGGGGGRRRRRHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I didn't want to pick it up. I knew it would happen. Like that damned Corona Beer, I got addicted. Great book, Mr. King.In one week I have followed Roland passed the way station, the three doors and now I'm with him and eddie and Sussanah shooting satalite dishes off gate gaurdians. I bought the paperbacks. I'm getting the hardcovers for my daughter. Thanks for the Tower. I travel there every time my boss opens her mouth."
5,Underrated?,"Tony Rice is a big headed jerk. I've met him a few times and that's my impression. However, having said that I must say that to me, his work is extremely compelling. Listen, there's a hundred and one talentless clowns in pop rock and country who have made millions and I guess if I were Tony RIce I'd be rather bitter too.He's just never really gotten the accolades and MONEY he deserves. His body of work is excellent and this effort in particular still moves and excites me years after I first heard it.He is with no doubt one of the great guitar players of this century. Worth your $."
3,"Surprisingly noisy, but fast","The Netgear GS104 switch is well-built, like most netgear equipment, and it's nice to have a switch that's in a strong, solid metal case. The switch is also certainly peppy enough, given PCs with gigabit ethernet cards. However, I've got two complaints about it.1. It gets pretty warm, and2. It makes an annoying squeal or buzzing noise (somewhat like two or more of the ports are unconnected or connected to a device that's powered off. Once the third connection is enabled, it's silent. There's no fan, so when at least three connections are on, there's no noise at all.For a switch intended for desktop use, where not all ports are always connected to powered-up equipment, the squealing/buzzing noise is very unpleasant. If you're sure to have at least three of the four ports connected and powered on during the time you'll be within 10 feet of the switch, it's a great unit. Otherwise, you might want to look for something quieter."
4,He only has 10 fingers! Really--only 10.,"Tom Constanten composes and plays the ragtime of the gods, and this CD includes one of his best--the 'San Andreas Stomp', from his US bicentenial suite, 'The Syntax Collector'. If only he'd included the rest of it this CD would be auditory Nirvanna. Many other wonderful things too including some electronically prepared keyboard pieces, some classical piecies (including a lovely Bach), and some splendidly played Grateful Dead tunes (Tom's is one of my favorite recordings of 'Dark Star'). But the treasures are Tom's own compositions including 'Encodex Punctilious'. And is piano chops are close to unbelievable. Some of these pieces are technically unplayable for most earthling pianists.You'll never know how much you need this CD 'till you get it."
5,Some of the best Christian literature out there,"The Rift In Time series is some of the best Christian Literature out there. Both the quality of the writing and the depth of ideas are every bit as good as We all Fall Down, probably the best Christian novel ever written..."
5,A Great Read - Could Not Put It Down,"This book has everything ... strong plot, great characters, intrigue, and an important, hopeful message."
4,Would make a Great Movie,"Rift in Time is a novel about an archeologist who starts off by discovering/exploring Noah's Ark. Then he sets off to find the garden of Eden, but there are evil forces at work that don't want him (or anyone else) to find it. It's written in the present day and the author seems to have a pretty good working knowledge of archeology (to a layman). I not only really enjoyed reading it, but I learned a lot too. I should say that it is a Christian novel and discusses creation, one continent theory, and just a lot of spiritual content. Staunch atheists beware. It's a cross between Peretti's This Present Darkness, a Tom Clancy novel and Indiana Jones. The one fault I will mention is the author tries too hard to explain Christianity through the conversations of the characters. All in all, it's a really good read with unexpected twists and turns."
4,Noah and the Clone,"Ummm . . . how does someone discover Noah's Ark but still deny that God had a role in it's existence? Oh, well. Though logically flawed in a number of areas, ""A RIFT in Time"" was a fun and interesting read. If you've already read ""Rift"" (or even if you haven't), I highly recommend you check out ""The Christ Clone Trilogy"" by James BeauSeigneur."
2,So-So,"I found it hard to stay interested in this book. I think the only reason I stayed with it was to see if the hero and the heroine ever got together. I found the theology badly flawed, which would probably not bother many people, but it quite ruined the book for me. I much prefer Peretti and LeHay, and wish there were more like these."
4,Interesting book but not memorable,"There really wasn't any suspense to this book. Once you catch on to the fact that the hero and his people seem to be chosen by God, and the people trying to stop them serve Satan (or an evil Master), then it becomes pretty clear how it's probably going to end. Some of the characters don't seem to have a purpose, yet the author keeps drawing them back into the story in some way. I had a tendency to skim parts that didn't seem to have any bearing on the story. It is written very well, and if you are looking for a book to pass some time in the airport, this wouldn't be a bad choice."
3,Old School High Impact Aerobics,"Don't take my rating of three stars as necessarily an indication you shouldn't get this tape-just take it as a bit of a warning! Obviously, if you've read this far, you know it's from circa 1989 so it's VERY dated and at 20 minutes, way too short. There's no real stretch at the beginning as there should be, so I do that before popping in the tape and I play the aerobics part twice to get about 30 minutes or so of getting my heart rate up. That said, I was breathing hard and worked up a little sweat by the end so it served that purpose. Most of all, for those of us who have been working out since the eighties and don't care for the newer so-called ""aerobics workouts"" and just want to get the heart rate up without thinking about needlessly complicated choreography, (or jumping around on that darn step!!!) this is not a bad place to start."
2,Was not impressed,I love Ron Wagner but not this album. He added disco...ahem I mean club beats...to the music on this CD. Totally took away from his talent and it sounds just like all the other trendy stuff that is out there. Go back to what you use to do!!!!
5,"Beuatiful, but tricky to install","All of these Talavera switchplates are beautiful and colorful, and surprisingly well made and durable. Just be aware that they do not fit flush to the wall like the plastic ones. You are going to have to do a lot of fiddling with the switches themselves - I had to put individually-made plastic shims behind the tops and bottom of each switch, so they were out from the wall enough so the screws holding the switchplate would actually reach the switches."
4,Nice Book on Matrix Structural Analysis,This is a nice book on matrix structural analysiswith stiffness and flexibility methods for computerbased and finite element analysis.Includes all topics of interest in structures for civil engineering. Check it out from your library. It is asgood as any newer book on the subject. probably better.
4,I Like This Book!,I'm a huge Christie fan. This book takes a look at her books in order. It's a little collector guide and picture book of the first edition sleeves. It could be a little more edited or tightened up but it's a great book. I've read most of the Christie books but will re-read some of the information about the plots in this book. It's a great guide for any fan and it's priced reasonably too!
4,"No reviews on this, eh?","OK, so as with all comps there are some stinkers, but this is still a pretty great collection, lots of odd stuff I think all coming out of the Providence, RI area (not terribly familiar with the scene). If you're into experimental, sometimes funny music, check this out for sure... worth it just for Gerty Farish"
3,Black Rose,"Some of these songs are full of meaning and pleasant to the ear, while others mimic each other and lack originality. The soft beat is wonderful and gets my attention more than today's music."
3,Black Rose,"This is a pleasant listen even if you are not a great fan of J.D. Souther or the Eagles. There are a few tracks that for me are standout tunes such as ""If You Have Crying Eyes"" and ""Simple Man, Simple Dream"". The rest are just nice tunes. Don't get me wrong, I am not upset about purchasing this album but if you want something that better reflects the range of this artist there are better albums to pick from."
1,Grossly Disappointed,"I find it quite amazing that the author included the words ""Price Guide"" when titling her book. What might be more applicable are the words ""Mini-Bio's of Native American Artisans"" since that's primarily what this book is. If I had wanted to learn birth/death dates or more about the formal educations of these individuals, I have a local library that I could have visited gratis. I WANTED a PRICE GUIDE reference book as the title implied it to be, and this book sorely missed the mark. It was a waste of both money and time."
2,lifeless vampire story,"Hitchhiking waitress meets vampire trucker, reader meets Sandman.And that about sums it up. This novel is too generic. This novel has about zero originality, from the stereotyped characters to the paint-by-numbers plot. If this were a movie, it would be one of those low-budget, late-night time-fillers that air in the wee hours hours on USA or SCI-FI."
1,1 Star is too nice a rating,"In 2 words, forget this! Many pieces had visible surface errors (about 25%). Another 60% would get an error recording after about 10 minutes. The final recording time gave about 15 minutes, not 30 minutes in standard mode. Sony and Panasonic DVD-R had almost no issues. About 1% would lose a few minutes. Not 60% losing 50% of the recording time.Junk. Horrible. Forget these.Save yourself grief. I rarely have to give a bad review. This is one of my very few bad reviews. These are really bad.Tcat"
4,Worth a Listen...Roots Reggae Music Lovers.,"I first got a copy of EVER-Gs first CD 2-years ago and love his voice and music.LET JAH MUSIC PLAY is a lively song that gets me moving everytime I hear it. MISS VANITY and DANCE REGGAE MUSIC are also great tunes. The title track INDEPENDENCE is liberation for many with the lyrics and the music.But my FAVORITE is LIFE! Very catchy hook, and you will be singing ""I've Got One Life"" by the second chours! :-) I've had the pleasure of seeing him perform in person....the recordings will never match the LIVE performance.EVER-G keep making music!"
3,More Strange Highways,Received quickly. Interesting but pretty much an abbreviated repeat of sightings from more informative books.
2,disappointing,"Jerry Coleman is not his brother, Loren. This book was sort of a disjointed account of strange things that have happened to him and his mother and other random reportings."
2,Had potential but came up empty,"I was very interested when I heard of this After Dark Horrorfest so I jumped on this one when it came out on DVD. The premise had so much potential to be a really scary flick, but turned out to be such the opposite. It started out with some creepy moments but quickly got off track and turned into a typical corny horror movie. One thing I will give it was the creatures in the movie were pretty freaky looking, but it just wasn't enough.I wouldn't recommend this one if you are looking for a scare."
1,Bad. No other way to describe it.,"Boring. Clare Kramer = low-rent Katherine Heigl, and that isn't any kind of complement to either of them. The dialogue is bad, the main characters are a drag. The professor and his assistant are the only remotely interesting members of the cast. The middle third of the story is somewhat interesting - I won't give any spoilers because if you watch this, you deserve what you get - but the ending is very, very stinky, for lack of any better terms that don't involve expletives."
2,eh.,"I wasn't the worst of the Horrorfest, but that isn't saying much. It was alright in some part, pretty good in a few, and terrible in the end. Maybe rent it."
2,"Great beginning and middle, horrible ending",The ending of this movie ruined any hopes of receiving a high rating. It was ridiculous. Bad special effects too. But the rest of the movie is solid.
2,Not entirely original...,"So what if they borrowed the first scene of Richard Ferrie's novel BLOODROCK and left out all the juicy bits? Film does, after all, have its limitations. (Oh, that's right. Almost forgot after all these years and shopping the book around as a film... I did write it, didn't I?)"
4,3 1/2 Stars,"I'm still searching for a great After Dark film. I guess this is one of the better ones that I have seen. It is still not a great horror film, but it was close to being on mark. The story is a fairly typical ghost revenge picture with minimal gore. Some of the sounds are creepy and the director seems to know what he is doing. There is actually a recognizeable actor or two in the film, so it doesn't suffer too bad from weak acting. The story is just okay however. It would have been nice to have a twist or two to keep the viewer off balance. The CGI is not great, it gets the job done but it is noticeably low budget. If trimmed a bit with a little more dark humor I could have seen this as a decent Tales From the Crypt episode. I have two more films to go before I have seen all 8 films. I'm still searching for the one to die for."
1,Waste of time,"The movie was very weak in my opinion. The concept was interesting but honestly quite foolish. It was poorly executed. Special effects especially on the ""ghosts"" were dreadful. This movie was by far one of the worst horrorfest films."
3,Scary Enough,"This movie is by no means terrifying, but it has its moments. Its definately scary enough. I liked the effects."
3,Decent movie,"It's a really good, very creepy movie. One of the best Horrorfest Films to date.The only problem I had was getting it to play in my PS2, it stopped about half way through. It did work in my regular dvd player"
3,"Great premise, iffy in parts, but overall fun","I tend to be pretty critical of films that suck. Luckily, this ain't one of them. I can admit that there are some issues with the film (mostly due to budgetary constraints), but overall I was very impressed with the film's premise, a couple FREAKY scenes (especially a bedroom scene with the main girl coming out the shower...you'll see it and it'll make your heart race), the performances, and the movie overall. Pretty enteraining, and worth a view or two."
2,"great premise, lousy ending","This is one of those films which draws you in with an interesting premise, some good chills, cool physical effects and then WHAM! spends the money on bad and unrealistic CGI. (WIthout too much of a spoiler:) The end should have gone in a different and much more effective direction and satisfactorily concluded them film, but no! the audience gets cheated with an ending that has almost nothing to do with the rest of the film. Did the producers re-shoot the ending? Give the company some extra bucks to pay for CGI, regardless of whether or not it was needed? If you hated the HAUNTING because of the bad CGI resolution, then stay away from this film"
5,good movie for the little budget they had!,"i saw this movie first as well as reincarnation and i gotta say, stop hate'n on it cause of the budget! this is the best low budget flick ive seen so far with good f/x for the money they had to spend. it has a good plot if you listen and watch carefully so dont hate on the movie because of the production."
1,The Film didn't look that great.,"OK, I've only seen a few bits and pieces of this film. But from what I saw this movie didn't really look that good. It looked like it was a boring movie about the College crowd that dragged allot. And from what I've seen and read about these after dark film fest movies all of them are boring like this film except for ""Dark Ride"" and one other movie."
2,I HAVE SEEN WORSE,"Did anyone else think Ashley Judd and Angelina Jolie? This was not a very good movie, nor was it very bad. The actors did their job, as did the director, the writers, well? I will say this:it is better than ""Penny Dreadful"", in the long haul, although PD had a more exciting ending.This is kind of original,in that the plot will not be recognizable to most horror fans, so I would like to give it a 2.75.There isn't much to say about this film except do not buy it, rent it when the rental store is out of stock of them movie you really wanted to see. And rent it when you have a pocket ful ofmoney , otherwise, you will bevery angry that you spent your last on a movie like this."
1,It bored me silly..I thought the whole film was silly,"Well, it had a lot of people thrown around, sudden loud sounds (is that supposed to scare me?), with what I thought was very demented acting (even the screaming was silly) and even the costumes looked like..costumes made of plastic. I was so bored silly I had a VERY hard time staying awake and I yawned about 50 times. Seriously. I did. Big time disappointing. NOT scary. I thought 100% silly."
3,This Gravedancers is worth it,I stumbled upon this one and found myself enjoying it.Sure its acting was painful to a lesser degree but its campy.I thought the special effects were cool and interesting.Three friends decide to party on a grave site where one of their friends was just buried.This is where the fun begins! They are tormented every waking hour with ghouly faces and loud noises.This kept my interest throughout exspecially when they learned who the dead were.Its just the kind of movie to watch in the dark!
3,Not best or worst,This script writing is as expected and the film has interesting performances. Some moments of good technical support/fx. Viewers who enjoy the genre will enjoy this film.
1,Bad Movie,"In brief: bad acting, cheesy plot. It makes Snakehead Terror look good in comparison. Glad I only rented it. Unless you want a bad movie to watch while drunk, don't waste your time."
5,Worth Watching..,"Though I didn't get to watch any other films from horrorfest, this was the one film I made time to go see and I was not dissappointed. As a huge horror fan I was pleased with GraverDancers. The story line was pretty good and many of the scenes were truely scarey. Sure there were a few weak points, but I believe the good outweighed it. It's nice to see a scarey movie that isn't real gruesome or filled with profanities. I already preordered it and can't wait for it to come."
1,Horrible,This movie looked like it was recorded with a home video camera. The acting was terrible and the story blah! Definitely not recommended. This is another case where the movie poster looked interesting and the movie wasn't!
3,We saw this at Horrorfest,"This movie was so good until about the last 1/4 and then it just inexplicably fell apart plot wise (at least for me). I won't give any spoilers, but I wouldn't recommend this movie. It was as if they had a deadline and rushed the end. If you're looking for a silly-type horror movie (which wasn't what I'd expected), check this out."
3,"Well, okay than","It was okay, I didn't turn it off after 5 minutes. They really could have done better with this one. IT ISN'T WHAT YOU SEE that scares... IT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SEE! This one blew it when they showed too much.... way too much. They should have left it UNSEEN, I was getting chills until... they really should not have - well, you'll see if you rent it but don't buy it. Its a good late night freak show."
4,Good but...,"The movie was actually really good, until the end when it sucked. It was an ending that made the entire movie seem ridiculous. For the most part all the actors were great except for the guy that played Sid, he was horrible. Dominic Purcell as usual gave a great performance. It was worth watching but the end kind of ruined the whole movie and was really dumb."
5,great,I ordered this for college and it was cheap and in good condition and it came on time. I like it when you get what you order.
4,Comments: Intellectual Property Book,"I purchased this book for a Intellectual Proerty class I am enrolled in. At this time, I have only read the first four chapters per the class assignment. Chapter 1 gives an overview of trade secrets, patents and trademark including copyrights. Chapters 2-4 have detailed information about copyrights--federal and state copyright laws, the rights of the author/creator and public regarding copyrightable works, examples on how copyright laws are applied by using real cases. The author has done an excellent preparing this book."
3,Can a book be too full of information?,"This book while chocked full of information is written in a way that makes you want to give up after a few pages. If you can stand to keep reading or have to for school, make sure to have a highlighter handy for the relevant notes, if you can find them and peel them out of the mass of information.Honestly, this is my first book dealing with intellectual property so maybe it is just the subject matter. But even as interesting as IP is, this book makes me want to run screaming away or either zone out. It is like listening to a person who will not shut up and get to the point.My professor even makes fun of this book, so . . ."
1,200+ pages of useless copyright info.,A useless text for the real world. Patent paralegals are in demand and this book does not help prepare them. Copyright prosecution for paralegals is limited to finding the proper form that the client can fill-in themselves.A waste of paper!
5,A superb album!,"this album is really a gem with vocals that soar, with in a couple of minutes your hooked into the artist's world. anybody who loves great solid recording with harmony ,should consider this one."
2,I Prefer Karl Bonoff,"I love all the old Linda Ronstadt albums up through Mad Love. But I passed on this album, with three Karla Bonoff songs--sorry but I like Karla's versions better. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)"
3,"tracks #4,5, & 7 are very good. as usual her voice is incredible","tracks 4,5,& 7 are great. Her voice is incredible and good song choices by Peter Asher. four more words required"
4,Still Crazy (For Linda) After All These Years,"Bought 'Hasten Down The Wind' as an LP in college. My roommates dug herfor her sex appeal (me, too). But, that voice just blew you away. Stilldoes. This album (especially ""Give One Heart"" {love the reaggae soundingtag to the cut} and ""Try Me Again"") had been spun from September throughMay, when school was out. Sounded great then on the stereo, then the tapedeck and soon, the CD in the vehicle. Another gem in Ronstadt's widerepetoire of covering familiar and new songwriter material."
3,Brings back childhood memories,This was one of my mom's favorites. She listened to this and Simple Dreams constantly. I stared at the album covers constantly. Especially this one! This reminds me of growing up and how I knew mom was in a great mood when I would come home and this was playing. I have the cd now and I hope my kids enjoy the music as much as I did. I'm saving the cover for myself though!
3,cool but not to buy,ive seen one in comic-con but dont know anything about to expensive for a metal non firing replica even if its cool looking.
5,Five Stars,"Tornado in a Junkyard is a logical, very well-written and fully documented presentation of the facts. This is the best creation-SCIENCE book I've read. This book explains why evolution never happened (and never will), by examining the data, from several areas of study, which evolutionists traditionally use to prove the theory. Fraud is exposed and social consequences brought to light. ******* Get this book! *******"
5,The Best Creation/Evolution Book i have read yet,This book is good for anyone regardless of what they know about Evolution/Creation. I have read a few books and have gathered some knowledge on these subjects. I found this book to be very good in all its material. My only problem would be that he excesivly uses quotes from others. I also believe quotes from 100 years in the past are mainly irrelevent to today. The Last chapter of this book was wounderful it raped it all up and gets you on your way. If you read this and do not at least have dought in your mind for Darwinism then I feel sorry for your sake because there might not be much that can help you. I also believe that why the author believes in the ice age and the comming of the flood that there are better theories for it. The theory that i currently see most reasonable is the Hovind theory ...
3,Evolution--Theory not Fact,The author states that there is no fossil evidence for any period of transition from one creature to a higher form of life. He also points out the fact that evolution as a result of mutations would be highly unlikely. The book is filled with many quotations of both creation and evolutionist scientists in support of some of his arguments.Darwin presented his findings as a theory of evolution in 1859. Today it is often presented as fact. This book certainly casts doubt on the validity of the arguments in support of the theory of evolutionThe author felt it was important to note his own history as an atheist in years prior to writing Tornado in a Junkyard.
1,What good is half a brain? It lets you believe in god,"I can't believe that creationist are still using the same old worn out arguements and ideas. Science can't explain what good ""Half an eye"" is ? Well, having poor eyesight is better than no eyesight at all and offers an survival advantage to those creatures. Many animals in natural acutally have ""Half an eye"", poorly devolped vision, light sensitive cells and other things. How does creationism explain animals in cave environments that have eyes, but don't see? It can't! Creationism isn't science, but an attempt to insert religious dogma into the public schools. E-mail me, but only send me questions that are irreducibly complex!"
1,Critique of a Theory is NOT a Theory,"Creationists just don't wish to understand the scientific process.Contrary to what some others have said, I will not argue that the complete book is a straw man. It contains some valid critique of the evolutionary theory. Critique of a theory DOES NOT mean validation of another, considerably more farfetched theory. If there is critique to be found in the theory, the model changes, it is not destroyed. Once creationism is able to destroy the central tenets of the theory, I will buy it.In the current case, it is simply redundant. Peer-reviewed critiques change the model already; creationism introduces NOTHING new to the debate."
1,Creationalists are close minded fools,OPEN YOURS EYE AND BLIND ME WITH YOUR LIGHT NOW! This book is complete waste of paper. Darwin (our savior) should be spinning in his grave right now because of the complete misinterpretation of his genius theory. LOOK AT THE FACTS not the propaganda that is represented in this book. READ The Blind Watch Maker by Richard Dawkins he rips this ... tornado [stuff] apart.
1,Childish nonsense,"I just finished reading this mind-numbing waste of time and now I really need to take a shower. I always thought that creationists, with their childish arguments and Santa Claus logic, were semi-amusing and ultimately harmless. But now that I have a child of my own I think it may be time to circle the wagons of intellect. Dig?"
1,"Should Be Cataloged Under ""Fantasy""","I couldn't even call what is contained in this book science. It is a cobbling together of creationist fantasy. Evolution is a fact of life whether these creationists accept it or not. Why they go to such great lengths to limit the way their supposedly all powerful god creates amazes me. The only ""relentless myth"" is creationism."
1,Deryl Dodd Live at Billy Bob's,"The actual tracks did not match the table of contents...however the content was outstanding. Other than the mixed up titles, it was well worth it."
5,"""The Nugget""... An Australian tour de force","By chance I caught this movie on CableTV before I cancelled the cable due to the vapid nature of most of the viewing!! Then I went about searching for a copy (this was before I discovered all the video's available on Amazon). Obviously I now own a copy.Extremely Ozian humor of course. A slice of life... lotteries and gambling, wanting to live la vida loca... a group of working class buddies and their 'life plans'... an eclectic group of wives. A junk yard and and and... a ""discovery"" way out in nowhere. I would say a perfect script - the casting is flawless. Very very funny - visually and the dialog. One of those 'watch it occasionally to sort out your perspective' kind of movies. Definitely should have won awards. Much appreciation to the actors and those that made the movie."
3,MEMORIES,"I have this album for one reason. My ex-brother-in-law Michael Brady played & sang on it. Also the song One Good Reason was written by Michael for his youngest daughter (my neice) Jessica's birth. It is a lovely song even without the special memories it has for my family. Other than that the album is OK except for Rocking the Man in the Boat which is funny. Michael's band used to play this song & I remembering dancing to it at several bars in Santa Barbara ""back when""."
4,very funny,one of the best new comedians i cant wait for more material to come out. lets hope it is soon
1,Misleading workout according to my DVD cover,"Actually the Kickboxing & Hip Hop workouts on this DVD are great, its just the DVD I have, the cover is misleading. On the back cover it states that this DVD has a ""blender"" feature in which you can mix and match 3 of the 8 10 minute workouts all on one DVD. However, the copy I just bought, there is no such thing. Instead, kickboxing was on one dvd and hip hop was on a separte DVD, and with this there was no such thing as a ""blender"" to mix and match these workouts, because they were on two totally separte discs. Has anyone else run into this problem when purchasing this workout DVD? Maybe I just happened to get a ""bad"" one in the bunch. In the description above from Amazon in states the number of discs to only be 1, but like I said mine had 2. This is kind of disappointing to me, because I was really looking forward to the ""blender"" feature."
1,Very misleading Total Cardio Mix DVD,"Unfortunately, this DVD is totally misleading. I purchased it as it states there is ONE DVD with Quick Blender for over 100 combinations of Kickboxing and Cardio Hip Hop. Amazon states it is one DVD and the back of the box says to mix and match the 8 ten minute segments. Why the back of the box says...""two heart pumping,innovative workouts togehter on one DVD, you'll never be bored again"", is very unclear.There are TWO DVD's in this box, so if you want to purchase to separate workout videos, that is what you get here. I personally was looking for a mix and match combo.~ Lee Mellott"
5,Got the springs too. Good choice for the price,I have a 73 cb 500 and got these with the shocks and felt like the difference between a go-kart and Cadillac. The same time I upgraded the shocks and springs I rebuilt the forks too. I'm very happy with these and would recommend them to others
5,Great little product for locking two devices,"It's not Fort Knox but as far as cable locks for computer peripherals go this is definitely one of the better ones, and it locks down two devices. The cable is thicker and highly visible. This should help to deter someone from walking off with your laptop and other devices.I bought this for a laptop and an external hard drive but it will work with any unit that has a standard security slot.Note: It is possible to pick nearly any type lock so always lock your laptop in a drawer or take it home with you if you can. I had a brand new Cannon digital Elf disappear from my desk in a secure building with armed security because I left it there one weekend. I kept it in a small vinyl case that wasn't even a camera case so someone had to actually investigate it to find out there was a camera inside."
3,Check it off,"Use a match on one dvd and check it off. Im sick of WWE putting out the same matches, there is too many excellent missing world title matches to name that is missing."
4,History,"This dvd is good, not great or anything like that, but the History alone is enough to buy this.I'm not even going to bother with the match list; seeing how a bunch of users already posted them up and gave they're thoughts, Impressions and ratings on them."
3,Where's the WMIII Tournament,"This would be a frickin AWESOME collection if it had the tournament from WrestleMania III. If this is supposed to be an accurate history of the title, I would think that epic and unprecedented event would be in the forefront. That cage match with Hogan and Bundy at WMII was paltry at best. That being said, the collection overall was super. I do wish they would include some personal accounts throughout the matches but in a pinch, this dvd collection will do."
3,The new WWE norm,"This was disappointingly exactly what all the WWE videos now are, matches that have been shown thousands of times with someone adding a few words in between. There are no comments from the wrestlers themselves. I thought I'd be seeing the timeline drawn out with the wrestlers telling about it. Instead, what we have is a bunch of matches that are already available on several other videos. So to the die hard fan who has to possess every release, I guess it's worth it. I'd have liked to see some of the lesser known matches with some behind the scenes insight."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","Basically just another rehash of too many matches that have been released recently on DVD. A few of the older matches haven't been released, but this release is a shining example of why I have a netflix account. There were plenty of WWE title matches that have yet to be released on DVD, including:Randy Savage vs. Ric Flair, September 1, 1992Bret Hart vs. Ric Flair, October 12, 1992Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels, Survivor Series 1992Shawn Michaels vs. Davey Boy Smith, King of the Ring 1996Shawn Michaels vs. Owen Hart, RAW January 1998Kane vs. Steve Austin, RAW June 1998The Rock vs. Mankind, Survivor Series 1998The Rock vs. Mankind, Halftime Heat January 1999Triple H vs. Cactus Jack Hell In A Cell, No Way Out 2000The Rock vs. Triple H Iron Man, Judgment Day 2000Steve Austin vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit, King of the Ring 2001Brock Lesnar vs. The Undertaker Hell In A Cell, No Mercy 2002Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar Iron Man, SmackDown September 2003"
3,Pretty good but some flaws in a few matches.,"Overall, this is a good buy with some pretty good matches, notably from the Backlund and Hulkamania era. Could have done better from the Bruno era.However I must say that I was very disappointed with the Bruno Sammartino vs Killer Kowalski match. If you look very closely during the course of the match, you can actually see for a few seconds the razor blade in Bruno's hand which he uses to cut himself on the forehead to produce blood (blading in pro wrestling terms). So much for kayfabe."
2,Very Disappointing...,"When one sees a DVD entitled ""The History of the WWE Championship"", they expect the DVD to chronicle the lineage of said title, not a mishmash of matches featuring assorted champions. While there's no discounting the nostalgia value of some of the matches on the first disc, that doesn't make up for the fact that this DVD set is NOT what it's being advertised as being."
1,so lame,"i remember this as one of those 8movies2die4 that were too scary to be shown in the theatres or some such nonsense. please! there is nothing scary about this movie at all! typical ""suspense"" shots where you know what's going to happen unless you're a complete moron...blood that looks really lame, like karo syrup with some red food colouring...gratuitous animal death...most of the gore shots are nonexistent and off-camera, relying on sound to get the message across. the only thing that actually made me feel a little shiver was the burned doll that they showed for 1 second. oh, and i liked the blacked out eyes of the kids.like the other ""too scary"" movies that were released along with this one that i saw, ""gravedancers"", this falls far short of being scary or even thrilling or even good."
3,AS IF CHILDREN WEREN'T BAD ENOUGH,"This is certainly not the best of the Horrorfest movies. It is certainly better than ""Gravedancers and Penny Dreadful"". I like the premis. There is a lesson that many makers of many horror and some other types of movies need to learn:We, the viewers, need to see what is going on at night. It may be nighttime, but let the moonlight be shining when people, like the kids in the car, are being killed. Action must be seen, even at night. I love horror movies that are set in forests, on islands, on abandoned ships and other isolated areas.Had I rented this movie, I would not have bought it, but it is worth renting. Good acting,good writing, Good plot. Ben Cross is great for that one star to add star quality and yet something is missing."
3,Wicked Little Things,"I'm all about zombie movies, it's my favorite sub-genre of horror, and here we have a zombie movie in the '06 Horrorfest, so of course I was excited to see it, especially since Tobe Hooper was behind it. And all I can say is meh. Its ok, not your typical zombie movie by any means, and while it is nice to expand upon an oversaturated sub-genre, doing so here is actually more of hindrance than anything. The new twist added to the zombies here actually only adds boredom, this movie seems to drag on forever with nothing of significance occurring. It's not a bad movie by any means, just average at best."
1,You can't say you weren't warned,"This is the kind of movie that leaves me with little hope for the future of horror. It's just bad. Oh, it's not like the cast didn't try. Other than the teens, the cast gave it their all and wrung all they could from a story that has little rhyme or reason. Wicked Little Things is told through a series of horror movie cliches so old you may not remember the first time they were used in a movie. There's never any sense of dread or any real scares because every part of the movie is so well telegraphed by the use of these cliches. If you buy it, or even rent it, after reading all the negative reviews you can't say you weren't warned."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"I was soooo excited when Houston had the Horrorfest. These movies were supposed to be too scary to be seen in theaters. I saw 3 of them and I can proudly say that I wasted my $8 per movie. This movie in particular ""Wicked Little Things"" had potential, but fell flat. The movie started ok, but ended just like every other horror movie. The acting was very bad. The movie was not scary to sat the least.If you are a hooror junkie like me, then rent it. Do not buy this movie. You have been forewarned!"
3,Wicked Little Thngs,This movie was just ok. It wasn't really what I would call horror compared to other movies in the Horrorfest series. I had seen this movie prior to buying it but I didn't remember it. Clue #1. If I did I wouldn't have purchased it. You could find better things to do with your money & I only paid a penny for it.
5,Great child zombie flick,"I like the old fashioned, use your imagination horror films. This movie is creepy. The child zombies have a very single minded intent that I found chilling. They knew who they wanted and who was exempt. They were deliberate. Rather chilling if you ask me."
3,Alright,"Not the best movie, but the best I've seen from Horrorfest (haven't seen em all). It has some good scenes and bad, I mean how many time can you get lost in the wood, if it has a path. Still it wasn't too bad. The acting (most of it) was pretty good. I saw it free, but I'd recommend renting it, since there not much good horror out there anyway."
3,Cool Movie,"No,It wasn't the best horror movie I've ever seen. However,it's definitely not the worst. The film's cinematography offered the darkness you remembered as a kid. That eerie feeling that something wasn't quite right,so get the hell out of there. Which is lacking in most of today's horror movies, with an exception of some."
2,Wicked Bad Movie!!,"Do not waste your money or tine on this movie. It is so horrible and makes no sense. The entire movie is like in pitch black, you have to really struggle to see what is going on. Not worth it!"
2,Wasted potential sums it up nicely.,"Not as strong as some of the other After Dark Horrorfest films. The woods could have been such a great setting for a really horrifying, spooky film. But they aren't. The Zombie kids are not scarey in the slightest. The acting by them mom is pretty bad. The little girl is too precious for her own good and needed a smack upside her head. The only bright spot was the teenage daughter. Solid acting from her in a pretty lame horror film. No suspense, tension or scares here. Could have been a really good fun horror movie, but it just isn't. Wasted potential."
1,Pure Poppycock,"Single mom moves with her 2 daughters to an isolated property up in the mountains that she recently inherited. There, they encounter zombie kids killed off in a mining accident at the turn of the century. While the acting is somewhat decent (and the only feature of merit in this flick) everything else screams - GENERIC. Poorly paced, poorly written and completely derivative of several dozen movies you've seen before. Sadly, i've seen made -for-cable-tv cheeseball flicks on the Sci-fi channel with more appeal then this. Definitely feel free to skip this film in the After Dark collection."
4,Wicked Little Things,"I'm usually not that into horror movies,but I decided to make an effort to collect as many of Chloe Grace Moretzs' movies as I can afford.She makes quite an imp ression .Actually, collecting DVDs of someone I know I'm going to like seems like a much better way to go than going to the cinema to see something I might not like at all.This movie is a good one to pull out around Halloween; a bit violent in places but the good guys win in the end.And the bad guys rest in pieces.[Ha-Ha]"
3,not the best horror flick but good entertainment,this is far from an amazing movie but it does hold your attention and is mildly entertaining. it's about a family that moves to an old mining town and they are haunted by children who were once forced to work in the mines. the movie isn't really bloody just has many creepy ghost effects...i don't think it worth buying but it's definitley worth seeing once
3,Not what it Seems to be,"This is a perfectly watchable film providing you see it for what it is which is a Fairy tale; I suspect it was pushed to be marketed as a Horror since Tobe Hooper was allegedly associated with its early phase.As a dark fairy story its fine, as Horror, its not that great, but still better than one of the so called 8 films to die for, since most of these are slashers... One exception. Anyways, Wicked Things is Atmospheric, and if the Hungarian countryside is this creepy in real life, then no wonder so many dark tales have come from here"
3,As far as these Horrofest flicks go this one wasn't too bad,"I have definately been very let down by all the horrorfest films up until I checked out this one. It really didn't provide much in the scare department but did have an interesting storyline coupled with some decent acting. Something I couldn't say that about any of the other horrfest films I've seen.Now I am not saying that this is a great film by any stretch, but I would say it may be worth checking out if you are seeking anything decent from this horrorfest mess."
2,unsuable,"documents to go compresses my power point slides to the level where the graphics and text are literally unreadable. space on my memory stick is not tight so I would rather have the raw data, but i found no way to change this. a 15 meg document is compressed down to 580k, of course the quality is terrible."
2,Overcharges 9V batteries - not recommended,"I was really disappointed in this battery charger. The charger operates on timed charge for AA, AAA, C, and D cells rather than operating on the batteries actual state of charge. This can dramatically shorten the life of batteries that are not deeply discharged before recharging. The charger is almost unusable for 9V rechargable batteries, as there is not even a timer function that shuts off the charge voltage. This means that the 9V battery can be overcharged to the point of destruction if left on the charger too long. A really bad and cheap design, I wouldn't recommend it to others."
3,Only charges 4 at a time,I just wish it charged more than 4 at a time. It takes awhile to charge and they don't seem to keep their charge long. Of course I am comparing it to a regular battery. When you got a bunch of kids toys you need more than 4 to charge at a time.
3,NOT as described!!!!,"Product arrived without fuel filter...the price is good even without the fuel filter but Amazon seems to have a problem with proper descriptions of items, it is very frustrating to purchase an item thinking you will get all that was advertised...it is becoming somewhat a ""crap shoot"" as to if you will receive what they say you will receive or not...NOT GOOD BUSINESS!!!! GET THE DESCRIPTIONS STRAIGHT!!!! people actually like to receive what they buy...or maybe its just me."
1,No Spirit In the Moonlight,"This is not easy my friend: Dwight lose the Pro Tools!...it has stripped the groove and spirit from the tunes...I can just picture you recording to a click track...maybe Bill's back on guitar but he and the rest of the band appear to be held back...your expression on the photos reflects your confusion...the voice and the harmony are there but they can't overcome the sterility 'cause the ""feel"" ain't there...no energy, no urgency...did it take 47 moons because you had to learn the software?...now get back in the studio, roll tape, start with a real drummer and get back to where you once belonged...I'm waiting- but not 47 moons..."
5,Warren Zevon's First Album Is Great,"Warren Zevon's first album is great. There are lots of really funny songs here, such as ""Poor Poor Pitiful Me"" and ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"", but Zevon is no novelty act. You should get this CD and the next three at the same time."
5,Pity the Fool Who Hasn't Known This Album,"This album is inspired. The best ""LA Rock"" ever. I remember this was one of time magazine's Top Ten albums of the 70's. Guitar songs. Piano songs. Tender songs. Vicious songs. Pioneer Chicken stand songs."
1,Do not buy,"These shades do not work well in our SUV. Luckily the windows are already tinted so the sun does not get in our daughter's eyes. The Amer. Acad. of Ped. does not suggest using these since they can fly off and hurt your baby. If you have to use them, use the kind that you can apply directly to the window (like a sticker, but it is removable)."
2,Not So Super,"Even with its 17 inch width, the difference between this and other standard roller shades was minimal. I bought this thinking that it will cover most of the side window in my minivan, but it did not. Thinking I can tip it side ways, the roller was too long for the height of the window. I would have been better off buying two standard size ones and use them together."
4,Big Help !,This shade is a big help with my daughter. She as expected gets upset when the sun is in her eyes. This helps with that. The only challenge I have is that the suctions can fall off but that is 3 months down the road.
4,If my mary were here,"Harry Chapin's lyrics sometimes showed world class, such as in If My Mary Were Here: ...I'm a sad sack Sir Galahad whose sword's around his knees, with a grail no longer holy... Wow. He's worth listening to just for those occasional flashes of wordsmithing."
5,Great Album,Got into Harry because of my parents and I coun't thank them more for it. His music reminds me of my childhood and I could listen to this one anytime of the day and enjoy it.
5,"A ""omnibuzz"" of the highest order","Tate's poems pack an extraordinary amount of activity into a very small space. Quite often a stanza, line or sometimes even a single word (e.g. ""omnibuzz"", a brilliant coinage from ""The Life of Poetry"", p. 174) can stand alone as a mini-poem on its own merits.A first read of a Tate poem can be annoying: the queasy feeling generated by a sequence of these (seemingly unrelated) mini-poems that have a disconcerting way of creating new layers of meaning by forming uneasy alliances with each other.Like Shakespeare before him (yes, he really is that good--you've got to read this guy!), Tate defies linguistic conventions in order raise, affirm, and expand human experience. Of course no one really knows if several centuries from now people will still be reading Tate, but I'd put money on it."
3,Meh!,"Vastly unimpressed, both by the ""prose"" itself, and by the lauding of this ""Tate"" guy's taste.All literature is valuable (hence the stars), but within the first 30 pages, I was already considering recycling as box filler. The Pulitzer Prize is now as mediocre as the Nobel Peace Prize has become.Again, meh!"
1,The Man stands on the shoulders of Bukowski,"(How does he do it?)(Open letter to James Tate, stalwart UMass prof. :you won't get any toys this X-mas -- many months away --because you've leeched off the writings of Ole Buk and this isfunny because you possess the vitality and soul of a110-pound Alabama sharecropper.)"
5,Great Arm Band for iPod Nano,I use this arm band with my iPod nano -- it is great. Securely holds the iPod and fully adjustable. I recommend it.
1,Out of date product,"I bought this to go with the new Nano that I bought for my wife for Christmas. Unfortunately, it's a sports sleeve for the earlier versions of the Nano and there is nothing in the writeup to indicate this. It really sucks to by things over the internet and then get old, out of date products instead of what you thought you were going to get."
2,Doesn't Last Long or You Get What You Pay For,"I've had this bag for 4 years and it's been on 4 trips. I liked it a lot at first. When I was wheeling it through the parking lot after the 2nd trip I notice the bag dragging on the ground between the wheels. Upon further inspection I found the plastic on the inside of the bag had busted into several pieces. This plastic is supposed to support the wheels and keep them stable. It was no longer capable of doing this. Being the cheap resourceful guy I am, I installed a flat steel bar between the wheels. This worked for the next two trips but now it's dragging again. I plan on purchasing a new bag. I'll probably bite the bullet and buy a Club Glove. They appear to be much stronger in the wheel area."
4,A Rare Talent in His Prime,"Ben Harper is a rare and extremely talented musician. On this DVD, Ben and his solid band The Innocent Criminals deliver an impressive set of rock/blues/reggae/funk/folk/R&B, and make it clear that they refuse to be put in a box or labelled in any way. Their range of musical stylings takes the audience on a roller coaster ride of soulful tunes, soaked in the honest emotion only roots music can offer. Whether the tunes are inspired by Hendrix, Marley, Dylan, Marvin Gaye, or Mississippi John Hurt, their energy is contagious. Ben showcases his talents as a vocalist, guitarist (lap slide and standard styles, electric and acoustic!), percussionist, songwriter, social activist, and even as a surfer. This DVD truly captures the power and excitement of their live shows, and leaves no questions as to why this talented band has such a loyal following."
5,Pass the Soul,"This dude rocks. His music meshes reggae beats with the soul of Mowtown combined with blues from deep within. Even if you've never heard his music, it only takes seconds to understand Ben's genuine musical talent. He displays incredible slide guitar style, with unique fingerpicking riffs that can be heard in a cocktail of electric and acoustic songs. From start to finish Ben puts forth passionate energy, that simply ""brings down the house"" Its refreshing to know that ben sings with a love for music heard in his passionate tones. You will feel like your a long time friend of Ben's by the end of this dvd."
2,Bad camera work...,"Imagine you have the best bass player in the world in your band.Imagine you have a song, that was ok in studio, but has a really funky groove kick a$$ bass live, much better than the studio version.Imagine your bass player, the best out there, is playing his incredible solo in this very song.Question: at this particular moment, what footage would you expect fram a live show recording?Answer: some girl in the audience doing a breakdance!Smart choice, don't you agree?"
2,Not good,"This DVD is well recorded, good sound and plenty of content but:Ben Harper has been losing his magic with time. His last cd's are not even close to his first cd's, in sound and in mysticism. This show is full of new songs and also full of production, which gives the show a feel of lack of freedom. You dont see him much usingthe weisenborn, one he used so much on his early cd's. He's not much of a showman either, which hurts his songs. This dvd is ok but the bad thing is that Ben has lost his mojo with time, and you can feel it here."
1,THE SOUND IS HORRIBLE!!!!!,"I Think!My friends of the others commentary about this dvd don'tunderstanding of sound ,because i agree the performances in allmusics are cool but the sound is horrible,i don't known man, i think the principal engineer sound of virgin was busy with lenny kravitz.I have a vcd of bercy show and the sound is better than Hollywood Bowl;the bootlegs of pleasure and pain is better than Hollywood Bowl,i have a audio show of Bowery Ballroom is muchbetter than Hollywood Bowl,so i don't entering in sound details.This show is not good unfortunately.I don't read in dvd the names of engineer sounds ,but i will read,because in the next dvd or live cd audio the enginner sounds are the same of this dvd i will see and lesson before buy,I wrote this with deep sorrow in my heart ,i'm huge fan of Ben Harper and The Innocent Crimnals; but sorry, this dvd is not good.I Love the musics of Ben Harper and The Innocent Crimnals ,buti appreciate excellent sounds too.Rodrigo Assinger. 22/11/2003"
5,A trip into the imagery of a master story-teller,"You won't be able to put this down, and you won't be able to forget it, either. Your mind will delight in taking the adventures into which this writer leads you. The mental images evoked are beyond your control and your imagination. If you dream, if you read, if you love, if you enjoy fantasy, don't just sit there, order this book and for that matter, order two and give one to someone you really like a lot."
4,Not Just a Price Guide,"Sure, there are prices for just about every single Barbie item every made, but it's much more. This book is very helpful in looking up what item goes with what outfit, the year it was made and the stock number/name. The photos are very helpful to clearly identify which doll you are looking at. I especially like the price guide for the individual vintage accessory pieces. This year Gene and other fashion dolls were added too. Knowledge is power. You can't know too much about your hobbie/collection."
3,"Complete but no ""market"" prices","The book is complete, that is; you should be able to find whatever you are looking for back as a reference for numbers and years but the values mentioned are extremely high. Just follow on-line auctions for a while and you know that the ""real life"" values are.Almost text only. You cannot use this book without a picture book to accompany it."
4,Fun light read.,"Given the complexities of astrology I applaud anyone who can make a very basic text like this both informative and interesting. Mr. Alexander manages to take a unique idea, the planets as personalities and the signs as occupations, and provide just a bit of insight into the basics of astrology.This is not a book for the serious astrologer. This is an adequate book for those seeking some insight into their own chart without having to engage in math or try to interpret some massive ephemeris."
5,"If not the best album ever, definitly one of them.","I have been in love with this album since I first bought it, about six years ago. This ranks right up there with Heart of Saturday Night, Raindogs, and even Mule Variations. One of the the many greats, perfection once again."
5,No one compares 2 Tom,"Small Change was one of my first two Tom Waits albums. It literally changed me, added to me, I guess. I am more than I was before I knew this artist, and his influence on me musically far exceeded any other. I cherish the late night hours spent with my friend soaking up this record...an occasion repeated whenever the two of us find ourselves together."
5,My Favirote Album,"This is my favirote album just topping the local Jackie Greene here in town. They are very similar in style and in lyrical content. Tom has something else about him, however. Something that can melt the paint of the Southern Pacific."
4,"fairly good, but too affected","Waits' theatricality and performance artist instincts I think are overdone on this particular record, whether he's doing his jazzy monologues or slower, more sentimental ballady numbers. His street-drunk demeanor seems cliched (nothing as far out yet as ""Innocent When You Dream"") and isn't that interesting to me; a lot of the songs also have an affected, maudlin feel. This album was made after Waits had roughened up his persona but before he'd done the same to his sound; it feels a bit uneven.However! I generally love Waits and there are some songs I like a lot here -- ""Tom Traubert's Blues,"" ""Invitation to the Blues"" and ""Small Change"" particularly. But I feel that this album is pretty hit and miss."
4,Better,"Solid. 'New Orleans,' 'Jitterbug Boy'--complete filler. 'Get Off Work,' astoundingly mediocre. Should've closed with title track (sureal, great). 'Step Right Up,' 'Pasties/G-String'--cute, disposable, fun. 'TT's Blues'--not bad; not so good as public opinion has it. 'One That Got Away,' 'Invitation to the Blues'--yes! Classics! The latter especially.Not a five-star album. Hardly. Absurd supposition. Nonetheless worthwhile. Love the man, but most albums somewhat inconsistent, at least. Better than most. A grower. Better to star with Blue Valentine. Or Rain Dogs, for the later bit. Fan's necessity, though. Over and out."
3,Made of carton not plastic : (,"Thought it would be like the pogs the kids have: plastic or aluminum, real sturdy but are made of carton. So not very durable but my son still plays with them. One pog is very damaged.I suppose they are cool for my son to have though."
2,Bad Stitching,"The hat was of good quality but the stitching in a few areas was incomplete, I should have retuned it but I didn't feel like going through the hassle."
1,Cheap Burned DVDRs,"This show is of a lower quality and the discs are sub standard quality, DVD-Rs (burned discs), in cheap thin packs with color laser copied inserts. I purchased this show and it didn't work on my Sony 200 Disc DVD player because it was a burned disc - I had to return it to Amazon.[...]. People who are thinking about purchasing this DVD should know that it is not as good as others out there. In this recession, save your money."
1,Avoid!,Haunted Investigators is1) Boring2) Dubiously accurate3) Cheaply made4) Delivered on a burned DVD-R with a cheap insertAvoid at all costs!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!,Chris Bores is making money ripping off other people. First he rips off James Rolfe with his Irate Gamer and now hes Ripping off Ghost Hunters.
3,Needs More Than the Minimum,"I have an older computer. Even though it meets the minimum requirements to run this software, my computer struggles to do so. DVD playback is choppy.I have a software CPU meter which acts as a computer resource monitor. It pegs out to the very max when attempting to play a DVD with PowerDVD 5. Do not buy this product unless you have more RAM and a faster processor than that listed."
4,Very enjoyable,"Not a nail biter, but unique and interesting. The main character says some funny things that made me snicker. Mild language and suggestions of sex, so maybe PG-13. I appreciate fun books that don't have in-your-face bad language and sex. This book entertained me."
4,Excellent Crime Story and Laugh Out Loud Funny,"I have read two of the other books in this series and really liked them both. This is the best yet. It is a fascinating look at a self contained religious community in Wisconsin that is somehow involved in the murders of two local girls. The premise is a bit of a stretch but if you buy the premise its a fast moving, funny book. Tara Andy's Golden Retriever goes with the hero to see his old girlfriend who is now the police chief of the local town that includes the religious community. The author in real life has a rescue organization that has saved thousands of dogs from pounds. The humor is what sets this book apart. Humor is a rare component in any modern book and that makes Dead Center even more enjoyable. Andy just has a funny take on life. I am more of a PI or police procedural person than a courtroom drama fan but the author's take on trials and all that goes into a defense is interesting and detailed."
4,My first Andy Carpenter novel and I like it,"After picking this book in hardcover from a thrift store for my backup ""stash"", I had occasion to read it when I couldn't find anything new I wanted bad enough to order on my Kindle. I always prefer to read series books in order, but I was desperate so I read it. It took me awhile to ""get to know"" the characters, but Rosenfelt explains past history enough that I could follow the relationships easily, and soon was right in the groove of the series.Andy Carpenter is a good character with a good moral compass, and he won me over with his beloved golden retriever Tara, and the fact that he is a devoted animal rescuer. Apparently, the next book,Play Dead, is all about Andy rescueing a goldie that is ""on trial"" for biting her owner, and is on doggie death row for it. I just ordered it on Kindle, and am going to start it right now!"
5,Great,Love the characters. Great mystery til the end. Kept you in suspense all the way through the book. Would reccommed.
5,Carols ideas,Just finished this book. It is wonderful. I can't wait to read all of the adventures of Andy. Am looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Excellent author
5,He does it again!!,"Another superb Rosenfelt witty thriller. I've loved them all so far and this one is top notch like his previous novels. On to ""Play Dead"" now."
3,Good legal mystery with some imaginative trappings,"""Dead Center"" is a fast, fun read with a little extra weight thanks to Rosenfelt's frequent, engaging explanations of how the law would be applied in certain scenarios, and the creepy cult-like town that figures into the proceedings. Regarding the latter, the weird ""Center City"" is more like something one would see in a Stephen King novel rather than a legal mystery, and Rosenfelt should be credited for such a neat idea. He definitely has to use Center City again in a future ""Andy Carpenter"" adventure, as there's a lot of good storytelling gold to left to mine there.So, while I'm still waiting for that likable defense attorney character who doesn't absolutely require his or her client to be innocent to do an honorable, guiltless job defending said client (c'mon, admit it... wouldn't that be an intriguing read?), I'll nevertheless continue to count Rosenfelt's ""Andy Carpenter"" books among the more enjoyable law-based mysteries out there."
5,My VCR copy is not working great. This is a Christmas tradition to read this before watching the musical of Scrooge,My VCR copy is not working great. This is a Christmas tradition to read this before watching the musical of Scrooge. I have also had to buy a copy for my children in Ohio so that they can also keep up wit our tradition.
5,I am a big Dickens fan.,Te movie is swell. I bought it because Sheena Larkin is in it. And I think she lights up the screen even though she's a mature woman. This is a very interesting movie and tells a lot about the author.
5,"Extraordinary movie, rare gem.","I received this movie as a present and didn't know what to expect. From the beginning I was glued to my seat, watching in fascination. Charles Dickens comes to life; Christopher Heyerdahl's portrayal of him was quite amazing. You get a feel for the London of Dickens' day: the people, the conditions, the era.In this movie,you are given a fictional account of how Dickens' masterpiece, A Christmas Carol, was created. It is imaginative and entertaining and, at the same time, strangely believable. Frankly, I'd like to believe this is exactly how Charles Dickens came up with the idea for A Christmas Carol. It fits his story very well.All told, this is one of the better movies I've seen in a very long time. If you love Charles Dickens and A Christmas Carol, I wouldn't be surprised if you feel the same."
2,"Nothing like ""Like Water for Chocolate""","I saw this in a bookstore and read the description on the back of the book and thought it sounded pretty good so I bought it. Seeing that it was compared to ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is what really made me want to read it. The only similarity it has to ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is that it includes recipes. ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is a great example of magic realism. This book is pure and utter chick lit that is actually somewhat shallow.I very rarely give up on books, but I almost did on this one. I could not get into the book. The main characters were like the popular girls in school that were rather superficial. I could just never really relate to the characters in the book and at times was just annoyed with them.By the end of the book I did like the characters a little bit more, but it definitely isn't a book I will reread or probably even keep."
1,Generationally speaking,Not my cup of tea.I barely got into it and just knew it wasn't for me. I don't want to read about 23 y/o's at this point in my life.
1,Don't be fooled by the cute cover!,"Do not judge a book by the cover---even though it's cute it's Poorly written. The authors really suspect their readers to not get things--talk about a book that ""dumbs it down"". I agree with the reviewer that said it was like reading a NY version of Saved by the Bell only the characters were all ""women"" in NY. Check out ""Pick Me Up"" by Zoe Rice if you want to read about real Manhattanites with genuinely clever characters. These authors are just jumping on the Chick lit bandwagon and trying to cash in with unoriginal characters and poor plot development. Sounds like they're just trying to pitch whatever they can to HBO. Read Zoe Rice's bio, then her book--you won't we disappointed! Also, I just finished Something Blue by Emily Giffen---wonderful read!"
1,Didn't even finish,"I love cooking and chick lit but this was the worst book ever! I was really looking forward to it too. The recipes were ok.... i'll probably even use some, but the story itself makes you lose your appetite. The writing is juvenile and trite and having lived in NYC, I feel a little insulted that college grads in NYC are protrayed as air heads. I like characters to be cute and flawed but the sad part about this story is that I think the authors intended us to believe their characters were cool acting like mindless bimbos. Not one of them was clever in the cute and flawed way. This is a truly boring and high schoolish read."
1,"Readers are ""spoon-fed"" this one...","I was soooo disappointed with this one that I had to quit reading. I felt that the authors insulted my intelligence as a reader -- no depth in its characters, no real plot, such TRITE writing!!I was really excited to see a story that incorporates a fun ""chick-lit"" genre with cooking and recipes. Unfortunately, I couldn't stomach the characters or the way the authors ""spoon-fed"" the story to me. Very condescending... I, too, am wondering how this book was published."
5,Bon Appetit,"What a delicious treat! Charlie is so endearing and JP Morgan (her ""boyfriend"") is such a cad...This was a quick read and had me chuckling every chapter.Oh, I used the steak sauce for my hubby and boy was he in heaven. It is divine."
3,Light-Hearted & Funny,"Fantastic recipes and the main character, Charlie, is one sassy chick. I wanted to kill JP Morgan. I would say pick this up for a fun quick read. It will def. make you giggle. I'm in my mid-30's and I laughed out loud reading about the wacky antics of these 20 year olds."
1,I couldn't finish it!,"I could not force myself to finish this book. I have always loved to read and enjoy many genres so to not finish a book is a big deal for me. It's even bigger to come here and post a review.I found the characters cliche; this is not necessarily bad but these girls are so poorly developed that I found them annoying and fake. The heroine was weak, the dialogue was bleh.The other thing that really bothered me was the editing in this book. Multiple times I noticed words missing in the text.I'm awfully glad I checked this out at the library instead of paying the Amazon price for it. A waste of money. A bigger waste of time."
2,No cigar.,"I agree with the general consensus on this book. It was absolutely horrible.I, too, was looking forward to some cute Chick Lit. with recipes thrown in for good measure. Instead I got a bunch of name-dropping, shallow characters who can hardly speak. The author had the nerve to talk about mullets and Robert Frost on the same page, as if one could possibly compare to the other.One of the Divas even managed to say, ""We have to have some skill in the kitchen so that we have something to register at Williams-Sonoma when we get married."" Yes, that is the reason to learn to cook. Let me tell ya.It was a little bit more palatable towards the end, but still no cigar.Seriously, there is a whole genre of appealing Chick Lit. out there.

3,Just OK...,"I love to cook, and I love chick lit, so I thought this book would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it is not well written. The writing is amateur at best. I found many spelling and grammar errors throughout the book and found the protagonist to be kind of annoying. I have let guys walk all over me like the main character in the book. I, however, did this in my high school years, not after college. If you really must read the book, I'd buy it used or check it out from the library."
1,Is Daddy a publisher ?,"I find it hard to believe that anyone actually wanted to publish this load of rubbish. Boring people with no character, fairly awful recipes, no plot What's left ?Comparing it with Like Water for Chocolate or Sex in the City is the worst kind of publisher's hype. I am SO glad I just got it from the library and didn't waste money on it."
3,diary like,"It took me some time to get in to Spooning...it reads more like diary entries. There is a lot of lists and note to self type of advice (charlie talks to herself making mental notes in each chapter). I didn't mind this so much because it kept things going.Its very tongue and cheek and drips with ""girl power"" type dialog which might not float everyone's boat.I sort of dig this kinda stuff. Call me a suckerI just moved to florida after 6 years in NYC so I liked the references to your ""typical new york moments"". Oddly enough my girlfriends and I went to puerto rico for a long weekend a long time ago so I couldn't help but identify to the ""give it to me guacamole"" chapter.Overall, not fluid but an easy read and cute. I would give it a try. The recipes are pretty good and charlie does redeem herself at the end."
1,didn't download at all,tried everything I could think of plus web help and never did succeed in getting this to download.
2,InHolland we don't know Harry very well,"My son and me are one of a view people who knows any song of Harry,We are from Holland,We are searching for WOLD. I'm sure he has made better songs but as we don't know his music here but we are intresting in free downloads to know him better!"
2,GREATEST STORIES LIVE,"Saw Harry Chapin live, when he was first out, at a coffee house in Ipswich, MA. The live performence was outstanding. I have other cds of his - studio recordings. EXCELLENT. IT WAS A MISTAKE ORDERING THIS RECORDING. Want the music and lyrics I recalled - from younger days (am 53) not audience interplay and bastardization of the songs trying to be cute. Am desparately seeking the Anthology of Harry Chapin in cd form. Have the cassette - wearing it out. Do not recommend this cd - a weak 2 stars."
4,Great album by a great artist,"I first saw Harry Chapin in 1979, and saw him three times total before he died in 1981. His concerts were amazing, and ""Greatest Stories"" shows this while bringing some of his best songs out on a single CD. I think that the studio songs at the end are not as rich as the concert materials, but the rendition of ""30,000 pounds of bananas"" is worth buying this CD alone. I just wish that ""Legends of the Lost and Found"" were available... a concert album as well, it had more of the banter that filled a Chapin concert."
3,"Great album, CD is short 2 songs","I have the orginal album, but thought it was time to get it on CD. I regret paying full price for this. It is short 2 songs, ""love is just another word"" and ""she is allways seventeen"". This should have been disclosed.The audio quality is not as good as the orginal album either. Sad and shameful. This is something that will never be repeated."
5,Harry for the young and old,"I grew up listening to Harry Chapin. Even though he had died before I was born, I fell in love with his music and this album makes you feel as if you are in the audience listening to him. He is wonderful, he isn't just a singer he is a story-teller. Everytime I hear The song ""A Better Place to Be"" I just feel better about myself."
2,"Came on time nicely, but doesn't play very well","I adore Harry Chapin and the Live album is my favorite. We had it on tape and album forever, but was excited to get it on CD. Sadly, though it came on time very nicely, the CD doesn't work very well. It gets stuck between every song and I have to fast forward at the end of each song, to get to the next, which is annoying, and I miss the beginning of each subsequent song. I've never had a problem with used CDs on Amazon, so figure this is just bad luck. But it's such a wonderful CD and I'm sad it doesn't play well."
5,MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE ALBUM,"No one has a way with words like Harry Chapin did. I never leave home without this tape. Thank you, Harry!"
4,New Chapin Fan,"Harry Chapin's charm eminates from each verse. He can make you cry to yourself and then laugh out loud in 45 minutes of live recordings. My father turned me on to Chapin with this CD, and now I play it for my 7 month old son. Don't miss it."
4,"Great Album, but missing songs","Great Album, but they eliminated 2 songs that were on the vinyl album, one of which, (She's always seventeen) is one of my favorites."
3,PART of The Story,"Book group selection for liberal Episcopal church. The Story is accessible and readible, and elicits some interesting discussion. But the bare bones approach moves along a bit like a 7th grade text book, all the ""meat"" gone (and a lot of the edgier Bibles stories--whre is Job, for instance?). It may provoke me to go on to read the actual BOOK. Good place to start, but definitely not the whole story on which Christianity is based."
4,The Bible In Story Format,"""The Story"" follows the Bible very closely. I like it because it is a companion to the Bible as it makes the stories easier to follow. I also like the discussion section that has led to some very insightful observation in our Sunday School class."
4,great book,I brought 2 one from me and 1 for a friend who never read the bible !May God Bless her as she discovers his love for her!
2,"Good, but parts missing","OKAY BIBLE NOVEL, BUT I DONT CARE FOR THE NIV VERSION. MAYBE A BIBLE NOVEL WITH THE MESSAGE EDITION."
2,Reads like a novel???,Who ever said this book reads like a novel must never have read many novels. It is hardly a smooth flowing narrative. Style differs enough to prove several different authors. It does cover all the major events of the Bible and provides summary of less important parts.
5,battle realities,"This one is for your older children. The narratives of the survivors of the Battle of Little Bighorn speak right out from the pages; they are fascinating. There is plenty of talk about the fighting and deaths. Parents may want to pre-read. Still, the worst details are glossed over. Your junior high student will get a lot out of this book. We're taking a summer trip to this battlefield; this one goes in the summer homeschool unit.Sitting Bull and his warriors won the Battle of Little Bighorn (Greasy Grass)... but they were doomed. Custer and Sitting Bull both lost. Great introduction, epilogue, and notes section. There is a really good list of the characters and names in the book - at the back. Very helpful.The cover illustration makes it seem as though this book will appeal to younger children, but in my opinion, 7th grade is just about the lower limit. Gritty reality."
2,Disappointed,"I love Masque Slot games because they are so realistic, same games played in casinos. This game has tons of oddball games which are not realistic and very disappointing. Sorry I spent the money on this one."
4,Masque Video Slots,"This was very easy to download into my computer and you do not have to keep the disc in to play the games. Big bonus there for me. out of the 25 slot machines, I play 14 of them and Betti the Yetti is my favorite. Cats is a wonderful game to play just for the incredible graphics. It's also a fun game.You won't be sorry for buying this product."
3,"Older but still not bad, just like me","This is an older set of machines so the graphics aren't great, the second screens aren't great, etc. but it can still be a lot of fun, especially for less than 8 bucks including shipping! Some of the games are a little juvenile and/or a little boring but most are well worth playing. If you're only going to ever buy 1 slots game collection in your life, don't buy this, but if you have others and just want more variety at a cheap price or on a real limited budget this is perfect."
3,Lacks the real casino game feel,I thought the Hot Sevens would have the usual blazing seven bonuses. Get 3 and go to bonus roll. I will stick with the Phantom brand from now on or known slots from Masque video slots. I have Two other Masque Slot Disks. IGT Slots Texas Tea and Wolf Run and they are exactly like the casino versions! Masque Video Slots needs work.
4,Masque Video Slots with 25 Slot Machines,This provides hours of fun without risking your savings account. Excellent graphics and sounds make it a casino-like experience.
2,Not like the casino,"With the exception of the **7s** games, these are older slot games not even used in new casino's today. The base machine is the same for all games, with varying artwork which lacks detail. The 7s games are nice and installation on a Windows Vista computer was no problem."
2,Boring video slot machine games,"To me, this slot machine game was totally boring.... I prefer the regular non-video slot machine games. I tried playing for about 15 minutes, then got too bored with the little amount of games to continue."
3,Masque Video Slots,"Not quite what I expected, but very playable. Graphics are not what some others have, but satisfactory."
1,video slots,"Sad to say, but I never thought I would see the day when Masque put out such a poor quality game disc. You will find 25 games on this disc. You will also find the graphics are like something out of the 1960s. Reminds me of playing pong! The sound of the games, ""ALL 25"" will be the same. Yes the same....how sad is that? Sometimes when I read up on something before I buy I'll miss something. It was very apparent here that I can't find anything saying I have to leave the disc in the pc to play! What the heck was I I I I thinking. Honestly folks, if you're looking for a cheap out of date game for your reck room pc then this will work. However if you like gaming like at the Casino's and the Casino game at home this just won't do it. If you're reading this review then more than likely you are a casino go'er. With that in mind always demand the best, after all it's your money! Good luck."
1,NOT TYPICAL SLOTS,"All of the games are FIVE wheel. All of the games play up to NINE LINES. NONE of this is in the description.NOT EVEN one of the games is a typical 3 and 4 wheel slots with a single payline. With 25 games, I'd expect there to be a variety - not all essentiall the same [exc. images].If you are looking for the standard slot games, this is NOT IT."
1,Soooooooooo Boring !!!,This is the most boring video game I've ever had. Nothing exciting even on bonus rounds. Would be better if you could stop the reels too.This is a garage sale item now.
4,YJ top from rampage -good buy for a budget top,"Overall a good buy. Installed on a 95 YJ and it fit pretty good. Canvas seems to be decent quality for the price. The back window doesn't meet the tailgate so water runs in, but it is a jeep. Can be improved with a little add on piece of canvas sown to the bottom of the window and it will be no big deal. Windows are not stitched, just heat seamed but doesn't look bad at all. Says tinted glass but mine came clear. I'd recommend it for the price. Just don't expect something you're not paying for. Like all canvas it takes some patience to fit properly but it looks good once you get it all adjusted. I'm going to stitch the windows and add to the back and I have no doubt it will give me years of service and look as good as the more expensive tops."
5,The original novel with copious marginal notes,"Vampire stories have been told and retold with fascination. However, there are few that match the power of the novel by Bram Stoker. This book contains the original version with thick margins filled with footnotes, anecdotes, vampire lore, and insight into every aspect of this fascinating story."
1,How did it happen?,"Well.. This record were as far from the word quality you can come. The movie was so great. Then how did the album get so bad? Basicly Mychael Danna have three loops. One indian style, one screaming turkish guy and one set of drums. Then he makes this fuzzy, disgusting soup outof it. 50 minutes of a turk in pains.. I'm ashamed because i bought this record. But, if you didn't like the movie. You might just have the bad taste it takes to like this album"
1,8MM Review,"This music didn't fit the film at all. It has some very odd parts in it. It's very dark and mystery like. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone unless they're a fan of Nic Cage and needs pictures of him. It's very slow and boring. No effence to the composer, but this music sucks. Someone like Hans Zimmer or Harry Gregson-Williams should have wrote this score. I would have given this 0 Stars but apparentey there isn't an option for that. (Darn)"
3,awesome...!!,"i bougth this movie because a friend of mine recommended me, it was so sensitive....and lovely"
3,Okay,"I love the poetry of Rumi, Han Shan, Kabir, Walt Whitman, and Ryokan, and although Tagore writes on similar themes, I have yet to find a translation of his poetry that I like.In this book Tagore's poems appear clunky and disjoint, and I suspect it's a translation problem.I enjoy Deepak Chopra and have great respect for him, but this book is less than I hoped for."
1,Lost in the Translation,I was very disappointed in this translation. Bringing the language into modern form distorted the meanings and lost the beauty and simplicity of the original. I recommend Gitanjali if you want to experience real Tagore.
3,Performs satisfactorily,"This contoured windscreen works provided you talk at least four inches from the top of the windscreen. In fact, if you watch the President of the United States give a press conference, he speaks into two Shure SM57 microphones with A2WS windscreens."
3,fun but kind of short,"This is the first video from an old series of books that my kids love because they keep reading them different ways to get different endings. They like the video, because they get to choose which way to go at various junctures in the adventure, but all in all the video was short and not very robust."
4,Makaveli The Don,"This DVD is the bomb. All the best deathrow stars are in this Tupac, Dre, Snoop, Daz, and Kurupt. The only bad thing is not all the videos are complete and get cut off about half way through them. Also they should have put more of the better known videos like Hail Mary, Smile, and Doggfather. Either way this is a great DVD and the extra features really make it worth buying."
5,great purchase,"well well as i look at some of the dumb reviews once agian. And lot of dumb people u write on revives on amazon that know nothing,they just have nothing better to do. Now people dont listen to those wackos with the other reviews because they are so wrong its not funny. First off just about 98% that said on the box is thier so i dont know why people saying nothing is thier and sec the videos just about all of them are full maybe one or tow were short i should know i seen this movie so many times i lost count.How ever thier were other stuff death row came out with that had videos on it maybee those people were thinking of that and not death row uncut? huh could be so people get ur facts right before u write somthing."
5,The best,This DVD is one of the best video's for a party - Just put it in your system and let it play. The only recommedation would be more behind the scenes video of the Death Row crew. Sound is pretty awesome although not 100% due to recording. How do you want it is the BEST on this DVD!
4,It's Okay but mainly Disappointing,"I like it AND I don't Like it. What I liked is that it had some unseen footage of what went down at Death Row ( ex: behind the scenes of music videos, concert tours, etc.) and a Pretty good collection of music videos. The XXX music videos were also more than entertaining. What I didn't like was how unorganized the DVD was. Music videos were cut short and a poor scene selection. what also pissed me off was how the in between of a group of druggies dissing Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. It just totally disappointed me and made me regret buying it. Welcome To Death Row is obviously a better DVD than This.I did like the rare Music videos such as "" Lil Ghetto Boy"" from Dre's The Chronic"" and "" It Might Sound Crazy"" From Daz' Album, and Midnight Love from Snoop."
1,This DVD is possibly the worst one i've watched,"Do not waste your money on this, it is false advertising and poorly produced. Read the rest of the reviews for an idea."
4,Almost A 5 Star,"Wuts KraCKin My Peepoes. Anyways This DVD Is Off Tha Hook. Tha Only Reason Why I Gave This A 4 Star Is Because The Videos Were CKut Short. It CKould Of Been A 5 But Oh Well. This DVD Has Some Good Ish Ya Know. Old SKool Vids, Some New Ones, Behind Tha Sceens, And Tha XXX Rated Versions. They Should Of Kept Tha ""How Do You Want It"" Video Tha Same Way It Was Aired On Lukes Peep Show On Tha Playboy. Instead They Mixed It Wit A CKoncert Just Like Tha Hit'em Up Video, Just Ruined It. Besides That I Liked Tha DVD. So One Mo Gin Fa Tha BloCK."
4,Great Rap DVD,This is a great DVD showing the rappers from death row records. It shows you Dr. Dre and Snoop (snoop lays it down in this DVD).
2,DEATH ROW STILL JEALOUS,"This video sucked because its just Snoop and Dres former record label still trying to bleed money from them. The vid is nothing new and Im on Snoops side that Death Row need to find new talent. As far as im concerned, Death Row are just a joke now since Snoop and Dre left, and the company may as well give up, judging by this and their latest music releases."
2,What a waste of hype,"Let me start off by saying iam one of the biggest tupac/death row fans in the world. When i ordered the video i couldnt wait to get it. Now that i have it i wish i had my money back. The video is all hype. All the videos are BS and cut-short. Let me tell you all what happens in the video: POSITIVES: A few Tupac concert performences that are cut short anyway. Some good X-rated stuff. Behind the scenes pac material. NEGATIVES: Only about 3-4 of the videos are finished properly. The unrealesed Pac videos are exactly the same but with a few scenes changed. Nothing really exciting. Dissing Snopp and Dre. Bunch of mark A$$ tricks who sit in a car that think they know what death row was all about. AND THE CUTTING OUT OF THE VIDEOS. BUYERS ARE BETTER OFF BUYING A BACKYARD JOB OFF OF EBAY OR SOMETHING IF THEY WANT FULL FILM CLIPS.THE BOTTEM LINE IS DONT BUY THIS TAPE, ITS A WASTE OF 2 HOURS, AND A WASTE OF CA$H. I WISH I GOULD GET MY MONEY BACK."
3,Strange DVD,"This video is just strange. I dont even know where to start. First off--the video and sound quality are way sub-par. Plus-the music videos they show are censored and usually cut off. Another thing is-half way through the tape it turns into a p o r n basically. Its also silly that they spend the entire video dissing Dre and Snoop, dispite the fact that if it wasn't for Dre and Snoop there would be no Death Row video in the first place. Its just a very strange release. There are a lot of cool stuff for those who were hardcore death row fans (before they fell off). There are rare videos and footage from Snoop, 2 Pac, Dogg Pound, Dre, DPG, etc. So what it boils down to is that if youre a rap fan that wants to remember Death Row's glory days, then buy this video. Just dont get your hopes up too high."
1,Should Not Be Sold,"This DVD should not be sold. First of all, all of the videos advertised on the DVD package are not there. You cannot navigate this DVD like a normal DVD. On top of that, videos and songs are cut so short you can't enjoy them, case in point, the video for ""Regulate"" cuts off before the end of the video and Rage's live performance of ""Afro Puffs"" is cut short. What irks me the most is some of the promised videos just aren't there dude. This is plain old false advertsing. Maybe they are there and I just couldn't find them because I have never seen a DVD in my life where scenes repeat-I am not lying, you watch a video and a life performance in one point of the DVD and then it starts over to the same live Dogg Pound performance. There is some rare snoop video footage that I enjoyed, and the adult version of ""How Do You Want It,"" but other than that this DVD is just plain terrible."
5,Bah-Humbug?????,I haven't seen the movie but I have attended about 30 stage productions of it and I can't get enough. This is a great play that will span the age and gender barriers. It brings the holiday season to heart. Check around your local Assembly of God churches and see if any of them are putting it on.
3,Bought it by accident,Not a bad movie though. When I realized what happened I didnt contact customer service to get my moneyback. Looks good on my TV through my DVD player.
4,Toy Story,"bought for my 3 year old. some mild violence needs to be explained. Entertaining for adults as well. I recommend,"
1,Classic,A great kids movie. This will no doubt be a classic and be watched by families for years and years.
5,Love this movie.,"It's a classic, good for all ages, it never gets old. I can watch this all the time, the humor is great"
5,Perfect,"My grandson had the 3rd edition first, but now he loves this one the best. It arrived on time and in perfect condition."
3,Toy Story,"Bought for family member, didnt know VHS still existed. they liked it so that's all that counts. ! ! !"
3,Cute plush toy,"Not much of a ""toy"" I guess. Just another stuffed animal, only instead of a bear or bunny it's a ball. Nice to add to a Harry Potter collection, though. The wings are a bit flimsy, but they are still attached, so that's a good thing! I'd be hesitant to toss it around in fear of breaking off a wing, but again, if you're looking to add to a collection, it's a cute addition."
2,Silly and disappointing,"The first one was much more inclusive of the classic scams that made Scott and Todd's NY morning show so hilarious. There are just a few funny bits here, but mostly it contains silly songs that are not at all funny or memorable. Don't waste your money."
4,pollard's personal favorite,"the man himself declares this his best work, so who am i to quibble? though i prefer the oddball nature of his first two solo albums, this, his third, is a wonderful ride. not as lo-fi as its predecessors, it possesses a charm all its own. as GbV were moving away from the DIY sound, they risked losing some die-hard fans. instead of using the solo records as an opportunity to placate them, kid marine proves that this was the direction bob wanted to go. can you really recreate the magic of bee thousand and alien lanes over and over. and with that it is perplexing that as the sound gets more accessible, the songs require more patience from the listener to sink in and truly absorb.for that reason, this may be one of the most difficult records bob has ever done. and, ultimately, one of the most rewarding."
3,Pollard's Basic Structure,"Simply put, this album is only fair. Pollard seems to slip into his usual solo album structure by stacking all the great tunes in the front and filling the rear three quarters with filler. With the exception of ""far out crops"" the above is true. However, the good stuff is great. Submarine Teams is new ground for Pollard's appearant desire to actually start producing songs. Great intro includes an interesting use of ""looped pollard voice chunks"" I find particularly groovy. Gone is the low fi, true, but how long can you expect Pollard to be entertained by drinking 14 beers and attacking a 4-track in his basement. OK, maybe forever, but you can't blame him for trying something different."
1,What got lost along the way? Lo-fi perhaps,"My first impression now :) is that the albums was not good at all; GbV evolved from good old lo-fi to, well i can't put a name tag on it but it's just some kind of studio hi-fi rock album, probabely made to sell. If they start with keyboards the whole thing turns out wrong. It started with Mag Earwigh! and it just got worse. The sort of 4/4 straight to the head kinda heavy wall of sound stuff just is nothing compared to there old albums like the brilliant Under the Bushes or Self inflected Areal Nostalgia or Same place the fly got smashed. There is missing something, perhapes it is Toby Sprout??? Conclusion: lo-fi turns in to hi-fi."
5,A great resource,"The Menu is totally essential. The only one of its kind, constantly updated, and right on the mark. Definitely recommended."
5,Finally a guide to do New Haven justice,"Murumba and Goldstein finally took advantage of all the city has to offer for true epicurians and students alike and wrote an honest, comprehensive culinary guide. Their reviews are more than just praise and their system of evaluation guarantees a great overall perspective of a restaurant, but is also detailed enough to highlight the best and worst each place has to offer. Excellent guide to restaurants; I go nowhere without it and strongly reccomend it for anyone interested in the Elm City."
4,quintessential guide to New Haven dining,The Menu is a great little book for everything you always wanted to know about New Haven dining. Pick up a copy; it's very resourceful!
4,Bag the Elephant by Steven Kaplan,"The book is a good rendition on how to go after and secure business contracts with large corporations and business institutions. The author advises us to get the customer and ratchet the operations infrastructure to provide superior service and customer feedback.The methodology for providing customers with strategic advice andtactical expertise is explained in considerable detail. The author advises us to build an organization chart for each client in order to market to the entity and all of its strategic components. This is a good idea.Overall, the book will assist in securing large corporate business customers. It is not a cure-all; however, the adviceprovided will help with marketing to the customer base.The author advises us to think big and hire additional staffto service the success which will follow with some considerabledegree of certainty."
2,Not For Everyone In Sales!!!!!,"If you sell services to individuals, and do not sell directly to large corporations - this book is not for you!!!!This book was misrepresented as being for everyone - regardless of the target to which/whom you sell. I soon realized that was little - if anything - in the book that was applicable to the sales of services to individuals. This book caters more to those in need of cutting through the beaurocracy that affects sales to major corporations.Be careful!"
3,"Money, money, money...",All we need is money.We love it.We hate it.Still we need it.We can't live without it.Money rules the worldThis books is gonna sell well and its author is going to get a lot of moneyIf you like to money just purchase this.If you don't like money don't waste your money(if you have any)
4,Very helpful.,"Bag the elephant gives readers solid, useful techniques for growing business with clients that make a difference. It's the difference between chug- chug and go- go."
3,Falls short on originality,"It is a well written romance, compelling and heartrending. When writing historical romance, historical accuracy is required. Pierre Lafitte died in 1821, which makes it impossible for him to be alive in 1860. If Ms. Craig's character was named after the infamous Pierre Lafitte, the author failed to stress that point, leaving the reader with the impression that it is the real Pierre Lafitte.~Affaire de Coeur"
2,Not worth it,"If you are already a healthy cooker you do not need this book.If you are not using fresh ingredients you will be offended by this book. Plus, you might find more allergies in your baby than she really have after reading it."
3,Nice but not enough,"It's not a bad start for feeding kids with allergies, but it didn't go very far. We can't have almonds, so many recipes didn't work for us. Moreover, there wasn't even a hint at the broad range of ethnic foods which might be great to try."
3,can't say it enough - the first one's better,"I know this is the mantra when it comes to sophomore releases, but it's not my fault that their first album was so incredible that the second one was bound to disappoint.This album is more of a straight up rock/pop style and doesn't have the eclectic mish-mash of influences that made the first album so intoxicating and fun. The music/melodies on this album are solid, but I really had a hard time swallowing the English lyrics and do not like them AT ALL.Maybe if you had never heard a record before, and someone played this for you, you would think it was good. But true Kinky fans know that this band is capable of so much more. Buy it if you're a diehard, especially at the cheap price, but don't expect it to surpass their debut."
3,Not as good as the first,"Kinky's self-titled debut was a joy to listen to. Great melodies and instrumentation and a great groove vibe. This self-produced album has a couple of decent songs but overall it has a very odd feel. Perhaps they should have stuck with Chris Allison who produced the first album. The english lyrics seem forced and out of place. My favorite song is the only instrumental ""Do U Like It."" If you don't have the first album, get it first."
5,love it-love it-and more love for it,"its an incredible album, after hearing it for many many times, i keep finding new stuff.hooky, weird, sensual,..well..KINKY"
4,Need to work out the,This album is not as good as their freshman try. However it does grow on you after you get passed the lead singer's accent.
4,A band with cojones...,"Atlas is a great album, and their debut is amaizing aswell, But to get the whole picture this is a band you must see live to appreciate their genius and cojones. Every show that I have seen, around 10, has been absolutely ecstatic. They have ""Kinky"" sex appeal, fun energy, and great musicianship to pass the bar. Do not dismiss them as not Latino enough. These guys are puro mexicano with great worldly influences to make them stand out. Do not compare them to anyone else, they stand strong as a band to check out. If they come to your town and you are not invalid, make sure you go out to see them to cover your body in glorious sweat!"
4,i can't wait to see the Atlas live !!!,"kinkys debut album was awsome, i just got their second album today and i havent stop hearing it..., and wow !! Atlas goes beyond everything ive heard ... and i did not expected less from this great mexican band..Atlas is as funky and dancy as their debut kinky. ..but they even went deeper and develop better well constructed songs with their brilliant and creative way of writing and experiment...i just cant wait to see them live here in San Francisco next week...for those who love to expand their frontiers , with atlas you will be needing no passport at all.."
2,Mediocre,"Loved the last album. This one, however, shows the band going from Mexican electronica to mediocre quasi-American rock. It's a messy, frequently annoying album that doesn't know what it wants to be."
3,A small step backwards....,"A small step backwrads from their primer effort. Maybe they need to check their Atlas and find their way back to thier roots + eletronica rather than trying to be Ameri-pop-friendly. What we don't need are any Spanglish Bare Naked Ladies who are, sadly, all actualy men. Still- a great band who apparently I need to see live. Kinky in Boston anyone?"
3,Going Downhill,"In this album, Spoken became much more emo than they have been. Spoken is a hardcore band, this cd does not demonstrate their talents in that area. They are a much better hardcore band than emo. Their previous cds: Echoes of the Spirit Still Dwell and What Remains are highly recommended above this one. They seem to be falling into what sells them records and makes them money rather than what sounds best. Again, Echoes of the Spirit Still Dwell is one of my favorite albums, this band is very talented the just need to stick with what they do best."
5,"Utmostly, absolutly, rocking hard, kicking awsome!","Dude, if you're into rock, you will like ""A Moment of IMperfect Clarity"". Nice harmonics, beautiful lyrics, and straight rock guitars laced with a little punk. On top of all this, the guys from Spoken have a message to share with you and they are the nicest guys you'll ever meet. Support them, don't steal their CD...I mean, download."
3,Needs Errata badly!,"There is an error every 10 to 15 pages in the book or a misleading sentence.Hopefully the publisher will post an errata soon.The book by Quentin Wells is better, but it doesn't distinguish between the exams like this book."
2,"Great Study for Test, Not good for practical applications.","If you you purchasing this book because you have no idea about Home Electronics Installation and want to take the test, this book will help you pass. Unfortunatly, if you are actually trying to learn to do this, then you are going to have to move on to something else. This book contains several errors, and does not go deep enough that would make someone feel confortable attempting to install this stuff after reading it."
3,release date confusion?,"I just purchased this CD and like it, but Amazon implies its release date is 2003, while the only date on the album is 1998. I don't know what the real deal is.Beth"
2,not a good movie!,"The story line is not very cohesive, ideas are just kind of tossed around, maybe this maybe that. A person dies, well just another day sort of feel. Music is used to create tension instead of actual happenings. This can be annoying when mundane activities are masked with music filled anticipation which then falls flat. You know these kind of movies.*****Spoilers**************Spoilers*********May help youHeres an example of one occurrence in the movie....After a few minutes, a guy finds his fiancee dead in a large puddle of blood. She bled out they say. It is later found that something ruptured inside her heart. OK, why all the blood outside her body within minutes?The creepiest thing in the movie is a vat where cadavers are kept in the lab, no its not that bad.No you don't see any zombie action either, its only suggested and leaves you waiting for it.I say stay away from this one, but thats my opinion."
3,Will find an audience,This script writing is average to above average and the film has interesting supporting performances. Good technical support and development. Viewers who enjoy the genre will enjoy this film.
3,Slow,"This is the 5th After Dark movie I have seen so far and much like the others I think this would be a pretty good hour long story for Masters of Horror, but to stretch this one into an hour and a half movie just makes it boring. The opening scene is pretty good and I had high hopes for this one. The story is disjointed at times and just not that interesting. The acting is middling and there are not really any scares. It is interesting that they used real cadavers and I guess if you get grossed out by medical stuff, then this might be a little upsetting, but overall it was a weak film. If you don't have a good horror story to tell then you better throw buckets and blood and have lots of nudity. This doesn't have the story, the blood or the nudity."
2,Falls Way Short !,"In the very beginning of ""UNREST"" you can almost feel the potential creeping it's way up your spine, but as the movie progresses to the halfway mark the plot regresses and just plain old falls short and takes a detour into the ""already been done before"" catagory. To me the only sub-genre of horror that can get away with that is the SLASHER flick. Supernatural films must stay fresh to stay alive. With that said, there are a handful of creepy moments as well as natural gross-out's but not even close to enough to save this flop. I myself was not fulfilled."
2,They could have done so much more with this idea.,"This movie could have been way freakier if they changed the story a little.First of all, when you first see the ""HELP"" in blood drenched on the towel that Alison finds, you know right then that the antagonist is not dangerous, but is looking for help instead?Lame.The illusion collapses right here folks.The blood message on the towel should have said ""You're all dead"", and the cadaver should come to life and run around killing people.Instead, the ""spirit"" that possessed the cadaver just goes around possessing everyone else, and everyone commits suicide.Not fready at all.A psychotic zombie cadaver would have been so much scarier."
1,UNscary and UNinteresting,The cover for this DVD is the scariest thing about it. It's also one of those covers that has nothing to do with the movie. No cold corpse crawls out from a morgue's holding container. Wish one did. Then maybe it might have contained something scary. Yet another one of Afterdark Horrorfest's lame excuses for horror. Yet to see one that was good the whole way through. BORING. AVOID like the plague.
2,Give me a break,"This movie was terrible. Even for an indie it was pretty dull. The acting is lousy, and the story is boring. Just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver. The script is almost laughable and I actually considered turning it off a couple times. It was a good effort, but I wouldn't waste my time on this stinker."
4,Impressive debut for Ipson,"""Unrest"" is a very good movie. Kind of creepy and a bit on the scary side, but it is well paced and has plenty of tension and suspense without resorting to the clichéd horror staples that have become all too common.The plot is refreshingly original and deeper than most films in this genre attempt to achieve, as its complexity is deceiving simply. The film can be taken as a simple scare fest, but for those willing to look beneath the surface, there are deeper layers to the film that tackle areas such as the afterlife, intuition, possession, second sight, and the supernatural."
2,Mine is better!,"Okay, so I'd seen the billboards for the After Dark Horror Fest around L.A., and a friend of mine thought this would make a good gag gift (no pun intended) as this particular film took the title from an action-horror script I'd written a while back. And quite frankly I can think of a few better titles for this movie: uneventful, uninteresting and unbelievalby boring. Based on this movie alone I am not going to waste my time on any of the other 7 movies from the After Dark Horror Fest. Thanks for the birthday coaster, buddy!"
3,2nd in the 8 films to die for series that I have seen,"I have to admit that I am hooked. I rented Gravedancers and really enjoyed it. I have a review of that one in here too. Anyway, I rented this one and again was presently surprised. This is a tidy little film that seems to work. The acting was pretty good, but what really struck me about this one is that, as with Gravedancers, the writer seemed to have an idea and stuck with it. The plot was easy to follow and did not meander. The one thing I really had trouble dealing with: Was that formaldahyde they were swimming in? Holy smokers!!! All in all, a nice little film that was entertaining and delivered a few thrills. Not much new, but not a bad way to spend an hour and a half."
2,Another After Dark bore,"Again I tried to find a good flick from the Horror fest and apparently came up short. It appears these movies have some really well written descriptions and creepy looking covers to draw you in, but in no way deliver as far as the movie itself is concerned.This one follows a group of pre-med students who do a little autopsy on a cadaver that somehow decides it was disrespected and needs to get revenge. One by one they start to go down until the mystery of the cadaver is solved, but by that point it doesn't matter. Again this one had potential but became so boring I barely stayed awake through it.Don't bother with this one either, total waste of time."
2,I'm waiting.....,"Ok, so I was really stoked when the movie boasted the use of real dead bodies (ROCK!) but as I watched and waited patiently for something to happen.....uh the credits started to roll. I was hoping for some kind of nasty corpse to rise up and start killing fools left and right...instead fools were being killed left and right by...well don't wanna spoil, but you never really ""see"" any killing or people being attacked. Boring. Definitely my least favorite of the After Dark set. And the main character blond bimbo med student? Annoying as @#&% through the whole movie. It sucks!!!!!"
1,WORST MOVIE MADE.,"No Curse Words? No Nudity? Barely any violence or gore? Rated R? When I heard of the Horrorfest films I thought they were supposed to be the epitome of scary. But after watching this one movie from the bunch, I realized After Dark was the Hot Topic of the Horror industry. At one point of the movie the main dude character says, ""What the Flip"". That's when I knew this wasn't just a bad horror flick, it's the worst movie I've witnessed(.) I'm not sure what the director was going for."
2,"I didn't find this scary, nor shocking","If a movie is considered ""Too shocking for general release"" then there had damned well better be some shocking content in it. I don't just mean blood and gore. I mean something that makes it worthy of the marketing. Unrest doesn't have it. It's not a terrible movie, but it's like ordering a pizza and getting raw veggies instead. Both are food, both are tasty, but only one of them is what you ordered.Maybe I just don't see what is so shocking? It mostly felt pretty conventional to me."
2,......not quite...,--veracini wrote so many good violin sonatas....so why does halloway record a very early one written for alto recorder...and a corelli sonata?--(indistinguishable from the original)...the one in A major was a later one and a brilliant one....but the rest were kind of ordinary..if not duds--
4,Warm and Wonderful Story,"This was a wonderful story created by Ms. Medlicott. It was part romance, and part drama, and all heart. The characters were well-rounded and interesting, and the dilemmas that Amelia had to face were realistic and heartwarming. I was completely drawn in by the relationship between the characters; Miriam, Grace, Amelia, etc., and the essential plot that made this book a memorial read. I would say that the book was an easy read that makes for a terrific book to read in bed before sleepy time arrives. There are plenty of discussions on the story, so I see no need to add more detail. If you haven't read the book I highly recommend the author."
2,An Unexpected Family,"I usually LOVE her books, but was disappointed in this one. Was way to short and didn't have the ""meat"" of her others in the ""Lady of Covington"" series. Hoping the next one will be better."
3,An Unexpected Family,"I like this series of books in general, and was glad to find the story continuing. I thought that Grace's bad attitude hung on a little longer than necessary and that the resolution of the story was a bit anticlimatic. Still, Medlicott has created a nice group of characters, and it is pleasant to visit with them periodically."
1,I really didn't care for this book.,It's not well written in my opinion. I didn't even finish reading it. I got about 3/4 of the way through and didn't care enough about any of the characters to even finish it.
5,Another tender sentimental book,Great series of reading. Love that an author writes from the heart and shares thoughts and memories with their readers.
3,Typical Joan Medlicott,"This is the usual fare from Medlicott...maybe a bit more bland than usual. However, it is still a pleasant, and quick read."
3,copy cat idea,"Although I have greatly enjoyed all of the previous books in this series, the subject matter was disappointing to me because it is so reminiscent of the MISS JULIA series by Ann Ross. It seems like a ""copy cat"" theme and it always makes me wonder when an author so obviously copies another one's ideas. Hopefully this type of thing won't happen in the latest book coming out next month."
3,Surprise for Amelia,"Amelia takes front and center in this addition to the Covington Series. A woman named Miriam shows up at the front door and claims that she is the daughter of Amelia's late husband, Thomas. As if this isn't enough of a shock, she has a little daughter named Sadie and the two of them are fleeing from Mirian's abusive husband. Amelia is at first unbelieving and then distraught to think that her husband had had an affair and fathered a child. As usual, her friends Grace and Hannah rally around her and help her adjust to the new circumstances in her life. This book is shorter than most of the other ones in the series and has a very simple plot line, so it's just an average read."
2,Overly verbose,"This book is rather verbose; proofs are often unnecessarily long and are more complex than necessary. There are also some errors and some of the proofs are flawed. While the verbosity is no doubt intended to make the material more accessible it has the opposite effect since it tends to obscure the intuition behind the material even if it is easier to follow the individual steps. The book seems to often try to avoid the central ideas for fear that they will be too hard for the student.The parts of the book on groups and rings are ok (though not great) but once the book gets into extension fields, Sylow theory and Galois theory things start to go downhill quickly. Artin's algebra book is much better."
1,Terrible book,"Terrible book, that was extremely overpriced. It had bad examples and few that pertained the the practice problems. it gave no insight into proofs."
3,Its hit or miss when you get these,"I had a batch of these with media ID: Ritek D01, and the discs are pure garbage. When you do a quality scan of the scan, the errors on the second layer are crazy. Even though the disc played fine in my dvd player, I honestly expect data integrity loss within a year, theyre that bad.I also got a batch with media ID: RichoJPN D00, which are much better quality than the previous discs i mentioned, but still not amazing. The quality of 2nd layer burns are much better than the previous especially. For the price of cake boxes, its not too bad a deal, but for just a few, I'd tell you to save your money. Ive had similar hit or miss experiences with verbatim dual layer dvd+r as well. From what ive read and used myself, theres no clear best media for dual layer yet as there is in single layer media."
2,Great Price / So-So results,"Out of the 5 blank double layers DVD's, only 3 of them could be played on my DVD player. The two dud disc could be read by my computer's dvd-rom drive, but that's not the point. I didn't have this problem with the more expensive Verbatim or Memorex discs that I bought. Overall, the price is hard to beat, but you get what you pay for."
1,horrible reading,"As an avid fan of Princeton football and its rich tradition and history, I was excited to see that someone actually took the time and effort to write a book on this topic. However, after reading it, I feel that I need to renew that search.This book was, in a word, horrible.The author came across as a pompous ass that made it seem like he knew what he was talking about, but in reality hasn't got a clue. This book would be best used as a paper weight, or as a tool to teach my dog to take a dump on. It is truly that bad."
5,Fun dance song!,"This song is great. If you like the Tamperer, Mousse T., Alexia, Neja, Nikki French or Gala, you'll love this!"
3,Not all the episodes,"I found it strange that some of the episodes that I remember from my childhood were missing. And I don't mean that they were in another season. For instance, multiplying by six wasn't there."
5,Unusally Interesting,"wow is all i can say for this book. i'm not much of a reader but this book i couldn't put down. it's a very descriptive book but doesn't lose you halfway through it. i highly recommend it to anybody (teenagers especially). trust me, the books starts great and ends great!"
2,Elaine in Sunnyvale,"While these bowls are beautiful, they are not dishwasher safe as stated. The first time I used them and washed them in the dishwasher, there was a medium sized white chip on the edge. Tried to glue it back on and of course, it came off the next time I used them and washed them in the dishwasher. Since then, three out of the four individual bowls have small to medium chips. I now wash them by hand and wish I had realized that the first time around."
3,Decent Overview,"Good critique, but lacking in solutions. Also, would've liked a bit more detail on author's reversion. My intent was to gift this to my fallen away Catholic-educated children, but after reading it I hesitate, for it is much more a condemnation than an inspiration. I think I will gift it to a few older reverts,though, who will appreciate the sketches of baby-boom cathechesis."
1,Careful....I was sent a Region 2 video even though this ad states that it is for the US/Canada,Be careful! There must be some kind of snafu going on here. I ordered this product which clearly states that it is for US/Canada. What arrived was a Region 2 DVD. Having a difficult time trying to return product and recover my shipping costs! Great series and I am disappointed not to have received the correct DVD.
5,Great family program,The bad guys lose and the good guys win. The series was well received and the disks are the finest quality.
3,"Good for quick reference, bad for bird watchers","This is a great, small, fold out card for beginning bird enthusiasts who want a quick reference to birds in Hawaii. But if you are a bird watcher, or even close, this little pamphlet might not be for you. There are no details on the birds, their habitats, calls, etc. The pictures are good, but I expected more from this item.Don't buy this expecting a book; it's just a small pamphlet with photographs. Overall it'll be useful, but it could be better if used as a supplement with a real bird watchers book for Hawaii."
2,Fold out card with pictures of birds,"I assumed this would be more of a book. It is a fold out laminated card with birds. For each bird there is a picture, scientific name, and size. It is grouped by perching birds, water birds etc.I was hoping for some more text for a first time bird watcher going to Hawaii."
4,perfect for travel,"We're going to Hawaii in a couple of weeks and I want a birding guide that is easy to understand and doesn't take up too much room. This is just the ticket, its not so much a book but rather a folded laminated card that will easily fit in yuor camera bag, beach bag or, heck, even a bookmark for your favorit beach read. Its an easy to understand guide of illustrated bird life on the islands. Its not like a Petersen's Guide, there are no maps or background, just illustrations of birds and their names, for me, for trveling with on a hike, this is just what I need, I can identify them with this and read about them later in a full feild guide. Keep this as your daily companion and you won't be disappointed."
4,good parts,"Some of these are very funny, you have to wade through a lot before the swimming parts IMO."
2,Fair content. Flat and unimaginative.,"There is some fair content, however I was not inspired or blown away so-to-speak with the presentation and usefulness of the book. It felt high-level, flat and academic at best. Shouldn't a book on creativity be creative?"
2,An overheated brew of trash-camp,"Set on a Caribean island in the 1740s, this movie casts a young Patrick Warburton as an exiled Scottish prisoner forced to work as a slave. Warburton doesn't even attempt an accent and thus he seems very much like a 20th-century American wearing clothes from a costume rental shop. Co-stars Oliver Reed and Eartha Kitt fare a bit better but neither one will ever include ""Dragonard"" on a career resume. The movie does have one distinction, however. At one point Warburton is sentenced to receive 100 lashes and he receives all 100 of them. No editing. no montages. The resulting 3 minute and 50 second sequence must be the longest flogging in screen history and it ranks #6 in the book ""Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies."""
2,Pretty Ridiculous,"The author spends many pages trying to suggest that David Niven's stepfather was actually his biological father. The photo of the stepfather, used as ""evidence"" looks more like Basil Rathbone that David Niven while a I mistook a photo of David's father in his military uniform to be David Niven before I read the caption. A photo of his older brother also looks very much like David Niven though the author tries to make the case that David Niven looked nothing like his older brother and sister. I guess this is a case of who do you believe, the author or your own lying eyes?"
2,Important topic - poor execution,"This book covers some very important ground, and I have no doubt that the author is very knowledgable - but this book is poorly written and painfully difficult to read as a result. I think the publisher let the author down on this one - some serious editing work was called for and apparently not executed. For the money (almost $100.00), the reader deserves something better prepared than this."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,Well I received my Bonsai today UPS. It was packaged very well but none of the branch's are bent like the picture. That is what my step-dad likes the most and it didnt say it was OUTDOORS only. Now I dont really know what we will do. I am hoping a natural light will do the trick so he can keep it indoors. WOW. Its a birthday present and I cant send it back and it was expensive. Real Disappointed.
4,good but had slow moments,I watched the episode several times and had taped it off the TV.The cast was fine but Diana Rigg's character was not evil enough.And Aisling O'Sulivan's character should had been made more of a victim of her mother's acts in the story.Matthew Modine was great but he could had been given a better script.I did like Diana Rigg in her performance in Mother Love and Aisling O'Sullivan in the Wyvern Mystery.Both of the stories kept me glued to the TV.I still give this episode a passing grade but the studio should had done more to make it better.
3,The American,"Overall a decent Masterpiece Theatre production, however I found Aisling O'Sullivan's performance a bit flat. The rest of the casts performances were very good."
5,A fantastic book,"This book is well-written, it's a joy to read, and I think it might contain everything you could possibly learn from a book about bridge. Others have noted that it doesn't teach five-card majors, but I don't see this as a flaw. He teaches some broadly useful bidding ideas, including the fundamental that ""it doesn't pay to open a weak 4-card major suit, but there is no harm in bidding a weak 4-card minor suit."" The foundation he builds for you is so strong that a later chapter on ""modern bidding conventions"" specifically can cover five-card majors in just a few pages (and ""highly recommend it to all players."")As a newcomer to bridge I've found other books to be tedious and unreadable. This one is so witty, enjoyable, and informative -- I can hardly believe it's out of print."
1,Disappointed with Purchase of book from Amazon,"When i requested to purchase a used copy of the book, i was assuming that the used copy was for the latest 2011 edition. However, what i received was a copy of a 1987 edition. There was no indication to suggest that the book i was purchasing was for such an old version - almost a useless purchase."
1,NOT RECEIVED,This item was order and confirmed for shipment on 8/16/05 Today os 8/15/05 and I have yet to receive the book!!! Well=-- not good kimosabe!!!
3,Good if you play four-card majors.,"This is a wonderful book for the few people who still play four-card majors. If you can change some of the opening bids and responses to match a five-card major system, you'll love it. Otherwise, choose another book."
3,Weeks to Winning Bridge,This book is for true beginners. Not realizing this I ordered two copies one for myself and one for my partner. I shall give these books to people I know who are just starting to learn. I was very disappointed.
2,Five weeks to winning bridge,Book is out of print and was in pretty bad shape. I wasn't happy about finding dried linguine in various portions of the book. But not unhappy about the purchase.The bridge advice is very outdated - would not advise this book for any new player.
3,no product,never received this item. did not get a shipping notice.however i did receive a prompt refund upon inquiry. i was told product was lost in the mail.
2,"Nothing new here, this is only for beginners!","I bought this documentary because it was bargain-priced & about Generals Lee, Jackson, & Chamberlain. The problem is that I learned nothing new & although the dvd cover says over 2 hrs, the segments on each commander are brief & amateurish. This is a cheap, low-budget attempt to cash in on the film Gods & Generals & Civil War buffs will be largely disappointed. The same reenactment footage is shown again & again & looks like it came from a home movie! For those who want a quality documentary about Gen. Jackson, I highly recommend the A & E biography ""Stonewall Jackson"". Also, there are excellent Civil War Journal documentaries about Jackson, Lee, & Chamberlain. Trust me, spend more on a high-quality documentary rather than this elementary-level production."
5,The Queen,This album was exactly what I hoped it would be. It's excellent. I don't think there is a track I don't like. I was surprised how many bands covered her songs. Wanda is a vocal powerhouse. The only other female Rockabilly singer of her time that is even on Wanda's level may be Lorrie Collins. There are plenty of tracks on this disc. You get your money's worth. Do it.
3,"Great album, terrible bottom end...muddy bass..","I freakin' love this album...but they should remix it...to fix the terrible...god awful muddy bass on this album. I even bought it on DVD-A...hoping they would fix it...they did not. Great record, terrible mix. Don't believe me? Adjust your bass listening to this album and see what happens. Instant garbage."
2,"Great looking, but that's about it","These adapters, lenses, and filters LOOK great, but that's about where the praise ends. I brought the telephoto lens to an Opening Day Red Sox game so I could get some closer-up shots, but when I put all of the images on my computer that night there was a blur around EVERY single one of the pictures. This blur was caused by the telephoto lens. I did not use any digital zoom either. The Wide Angle lens is pretty good, as is the little tripod (tiny thing, but good for low shots; is adjustable). The filters are not the greatest. They work to an extent, but they are more or less plastic tinted circles. I've seen much better quality filters for the same price.In all, this is a GOOD beginner set for learning how each type of lens/filter/adapter works. If you are into anything advanced or want to use these for actual production shots, go with something else."
4,Orient Express,"A wonderful book from a writer who spent quite some time on the Balkan. About passion, nationalism, honour and revolution in what later became Yugoslavia. Makes one understand the situation that was and that was repeated in the recent Yugoslavian civil war.A must-read for all who want to understand a bit that place before judging 'good' or 'bad'."
1,Buy the Wilton 63302 instead,"I purchased the Wilton 676 and as soon as I removed it from the box, I put it back in the box for return. I was not going to drill holes in my workbench for this low-quality unit. I was very disappointed with the quality of construction given the Wilton reputation. The 676 is extremely ""sloppy"" (the front or mobile jaw had a great amount of lateral play). It has only ONE lockdown which I didn't realize until I received it (my dumb mistake). It leans greatly toward the lockdown (on the right side of the base) when the lockdown is loose. It almost appears as though you could give it a lateral push and separate it from its base. Maybe it's supposed to do this??? I own the Wilton 63302 as well, and it is a much better vise by ten-fold. The 63302 has tighter construction, better finish, double lockdowns, thicker bolt receptacles on the base, better pipe clamp teeth, etc. I am going to order my 2nd 63302 right now."
4,Charles and Ray Eames: Discover them for yourself,"An interesting couple who remained highly creative through the span of their careers. I first discovered their work as a child when I saw their brilliant film ""Powers of 10"". I intend on picking up more books of their work. Great reference for designers and architects."
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a Chilton repair manual for a 1995 Geo Metro, and that is what I typed in in the search box. What I received was a manual for a 1985-93 Geo Metro. I tried to contact the seller but received no responce.Signed,Unhappy"
4,Georgian era leaps to life,"Kalen Hughes paints the Georgian world with a lush and lusty brush. Not an obvious plot? The Georgians were sophisticated and civilized--but most of all--masters of subtlety. They could say more with a raised eyebrow over a glass of claret than with a loaded dueling pistol. The two main characters, each living on the fringes of civilized behavior, had a sexual tension that just about caught my hair on fire. Great first book!"
3,SLOW,Was disappointed in this book. Found it to drag in many spots. It had some good moments but I thought it was over all pretty boring and I did not find the sex scenes very hot. Pretty Shallow. I also found all the missed typos annoying. Who did the editing?? They should take a pay cut.
5,Spectacular Debut,"This is a perfect book to cuddle up with a cup of tea and a ""biscuit"" (as they say in England) or two and be swept away in a dreamy romance. Kalen Hughes has such a wonderful sense of the period that you'll feel like you've been dropped right into Georgian England. Georgianna is a refreshing heroine--not at all the conventional miss--who meets her match in the yummy Ivo. And did I mention sexy? (waving fan)."
3,Only OK,"I don't know what the big deal is about this book... it was only okay. I think the premise for the book is good, but it just didn't flow right. Sometimes the sequence of events and dialogue felt choppy, like a sentence or paragraph was missing. It also annoyed me that the hero was always being called and referred to by a different name... I understand that he has titles and etc, but just pick one.Normally I finish a romance in 2 days or less and I've been working on this for more than a week. I'd say wait till it comes to your local library...."
1,Horrible.........Don't waste your money,"This will be the first book I have ever reviewed, only because I have never hated a book more.I bought this because of the great price and the other 22 reviews that mostly celebrated this book. I can assure you after reading thousands of romances over twenty years this is the worst piece of work that I have ever read.The thought of the heroine was provoking but I never really got to like or know her. The main characters never spoke to each other and when they did there was no substance to any of it. I was tired of reading about lust in the characters heads and not hear them speak the words to each other. There was no romance, no real emotion. I never really understood how they could have possibly fallen in love, it just made no sense.Where the heck did the title come from.........This book will be a fire starter in my Chimenea......"
2,I was hoping...,"I bought Lord Sin after reading the reviews posted below, and I must say that I wish I hadn't! This is VERY far from being ""historical romance at its best"" (although it's a great example of why romance novels have gotten a bad rap).In the first chapter alone I thought I was going to scream if Kalen Hughes used the word ""humanity"" once more to describe a crowd. She's also fond of throwing in what appear to me to be random vocab words of yore in order to validate the historical time frame, but it fails miserably (and I have no idea what she's talking about). Furthermore, there are little details that don't line up that drive me nuts. For example, the heroine and the hero share a steamy kiss on the stairs as she's heading to her rooms. Shortly thereafter, bathed and dress, she come down the hallway from her room (which is on the first floor)...um....OK.As a lover of romance, I have to say that this one is weak. There's simply not enough backstory and not enough depth."
1,A weak plot,"The story was set in 1788; however, the author uses modern day slang and expressions,shaky character development and no romance. The men in the story were chasing after Georgianna as if she was in heat. Where was the romance? Not here."
3,MERV rating valid????,"The filters are advertised as MERV 11, however; when received the factory mark in the MERV 8 box was covered with a white file label and the MERV 11 was checked with a marker on the other side of the filter.... I paid a premium price for a higher MERV rating."
4,A good starting point,"This video is just what it says, a video for beginning metal players. Even as an advanced player, there were a few minor things Nick touched on that were new to me. So if you're just starting out, this video has good information for you."
2,A Great Album Badly Mastered,"This is an album I loved on LP back in the Seventies. I bought it with great anticipation, but beware the ""Bargain Series"" sticker on the front. ""Bargain"", in this context, appears to mean, ""We saved money by not doing any re-mastering and pass the savings on to you!""This is an AAD disk, which means that the original analog master was simply digitized. A better process is ADD, whereby the analog tracks undergo a final digital mix before the digital master is put on disk. Regardless, there is a noticeable lack of high frequency energy on this CD. It sounds a lot better than the LP does but not nearly as good as it could have. I can't recommend it."
2,Linda Ronstadt Prisoner In Disguise Mobile Fidelity Gold CD,"Very disappointed with the sound of this reputed ""audiophile"" quality CD. Ronstadt's voice is very flat, and recessed into the mix. The entire disc is very soft, and undynamic. Completely the opposite of the clear, and transparent sound that was advertised, and that I paid such a premium price to hear."
4,"Not quite there, but a good collaborative effort anyway.","Listeners expecting a Brit-pop film score will be very disappointed. Those leaning more towards Nyman-fancy than Alban-fancy should be delighted with the spin put on both artists by the other to create an impressively individual hybrid. Those reviewers who've criticised the raw naivete of some of the tracks miss the point entirely. That raw, almost redneck, throw-back americana on some of the tracks is exactly what got me going. And there is an occasional lyricism which shines through. Not a great album, but a good one, certainly worth a listen for anyone interested in seeing where this sort of collaboration can lead. More of it!"
5,Incredible,"Nyman does it again! This lively and terrifying score has much to offer. Themes recur throughout the album, but each cue is a distinct piece. Those looking for typical Nyman instrumentation (i.e. saxophone) may want to look elsewhere. Here, these two Brits, the other Blur's Damon Albarn, give us a score filled with Amerciana. Also featured are tracks by Quiltman and Philip Phile which are worked into the score. There are also to cues of Stephen fOster music played by Foster's National Orchestra that sound deliberately bad. These are probably source cues (the film doesn't come out until tomorrow). Check out ""Colquon's Story,"" ""Trek to the Cave,"" ""The Pit,"" ""Boyd's Journey,"" and ""Ives Torments Boyd and Kills Knox"" in particular. ""Run"" sounds like what would happen if Philip Glass wrote a square dance."
4,strange but good,"This is a very strange album. The music is a blend of classical, folk, and a touch of bluegrass. It is good but a little eerie. I am glad I own it."
2,"Breakfast, lunch, and reinforcements","Very unusual soundtrack, and certainly not for everyone. It worked very well with this rather bizarre movie, but is individually quite a difficult listen."
1,The actual sounds in the movie were just weird,"Now i am not sure if the CD consists solely of music heard in the film, if so it is like watching murder and mayhem to polka, very weird, doesn't fit, don't like it"
1,Save your money - listed to a poor middle school band free.,"After seeing the fabulous trailer for this movie, and knowing that it had one of my favorite stars in it (Robert Carlysle - Trainspotting, The Full Monty), I purchased this soundtrack...Big mistake. The majority of the tracks actually do sound like the beginners section of a poorly taught middle school band. The few redeeming factors to be found are track 7 - ""the wendigo myth"", which is chanted in a native language; and a later track called ""the cave"", for its haunting rythyms. Beyond the short-lived interest to be found in these two tracks, this soundtrack has very little to offer, and for $14.99 you could find a much better soundtrack to spend your money on. I've never before returned a CD for non-technical reasons, but this one I took back within the same day."
4,solid well built,No disappointments - the fixture is solid well built unit. Well finished and gives off a significant amount of light. Expensive but as lights go this one will last a lifetime. very clean design
1,Just say no!,"I spent almost an hour trying to adjust the band. My brother-in-law (an engineer) finally figured that out. Now I have spent more than four more hours trying to set up the watch and it still isn't right. I can not correlate the poorly written instructions to the four buttons on the watch. I think they tried to do too many things for too little money with this watch. Maybe the technology will become more ""user-friendly"" in the future but at the moment I'm ready to trash the watch and go back to a wind-up.Only buy this watch if you really enjoy a challenge or prefer to know the time in Japan (the default location) instead of your own location."
4,sonny LOVER!,"I love any movie that Mr. Landham is in. and this one is great! If your a fan like i am, your going to like this one to! Yes, it's not on the leavel of lock-up, but Sonny does a good job. Love it!"
5,Love me some Simpsons.,Yet another season of The Simpsons released on dvd. What could be cooler than owning all episodoes of the best tv show in the world on DVD? Nothing!!! I love my Simpsons dvd collection and it's really exciting to see it grow. LOVES IT!
5,AWESOME SEASON,I'm so glad to finally have season eight of the Simpsons. I just wish they would release seasons faster.
2,"Great show, poor quality packaging","While I agree with many others that this is probably one of the last great seasons of the Simpsons, I am continually amazed at the extremely poor quality that these things are sold in.When I took the plastic off of my ""Collector's Edition"" ( yippie.. ) box I carefully unfurled the case to see that the cheap cardboard binding holding the plastic inserts in was already badly torn.Why can't they use individual inserts like they did with Futurama or Family Guy? My speculation is that this series is the most popular and they can sell them despite the shoddy packaging...What a disappointment."
3,The beginning of the end,"Justin M was dead on. Before fall '96 I was a huge Simpsons fan. I could not miss an episode. The shows from '92 to '96 were the best thing on TV. Then something happened. The shows became, well, less smart. Within less than one year, I had gone from not being able to miss an episode to not being able to watch at all. The shows became painful reminders of what The Simpsons used to be. The movie this summer was the same. A painful reminder. I always wondered if some key writers left after '96. The hilarious timing and brilliant parody simply went away. The funny thing to me is how many people keep watching and don't even notice any difference at all."
3,Query about problems on disc one,Has anyone had any problems with the animator's commentary in the special section on disc one? I bought the Maggie Simpson head box set and found that the commentary skips through this section. I initially thought it was a bad disc so I got an exchange for a different set and its happened again in the replaced box set. I tried playing it on my laptop dvd player and it would not play though that section! So I am wondering if its a problem with the batch that was released. Would love to know if the said same problem occurs in the disc one of the regular box set. I sent a query to Fox but have not heard back from them as of 082106. Would hope to hear from others who have purchased this disc set.
1,Dissatisfied customer,"Well, I received my shipment of the Simpsons season 8 and I watched it, but it wasn't the collectors edition head. I was hoping to collect all the heads but the guy who told me he was selling me one lied."
2,Worst of the Best . . . or Best of the Worst,"I don't know if THE SIMPSONS have worn out their welcome, but if they have, this is the season when American viewers began glancing at their watches. In fact, one episode, ""The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show,"" lampoons the series itself by suggesting that something must be done to keep it fresh and as entertaining as seasons three through six. There are few genuinely funny episodes this time around.Something that REALLY irks me is the terrible packaging for this season. I know this is a superficial thing to criticize, but the DVD-plates easily come unglued from the packaging (what a stupid idea to GLUE them), and it's difficult to straighten them out because of the glue. If it's not done properly, you can't slide the folding set back into its sleeve. It's just sort of a headache.This may be the last season of THE SIMPSONS I spend my money on."
3,It's downhill from here on,This is the last Simpsons season I will ever buy. The seasons go from bad to worse from here on out.
5,more dvd's please??,"The 8th season of the simpsons is no doubt one of my favorites. Many people have listed all 25 episodes below, so I'm not going to waste space in repeating them. However I would like to plead, if possible for MORE sets per year. At this rate (2 per year), The Simpsons DVD's will not be caught up with what's current on TV until season 25 in 2014!!! (If the show lasts that long). Maybe Matt was right. In his 1st season DVD letter, it was his hope that ALL The Simpsons episodes would be on DVD, just the technology was becoming obsolete, if so this is a cruel cruel joke! I know they show creators are very busy now with the movie, and still making new episodes AND new Futurama, but I dont think 4 sets per year (1 every 3 months), is asking too much. Lets hope this changes in the future."
5,Very sweet - it touched my heart.,"This simple, sweet, almost corny movie somehow managed to push all the right buttons with me. It's about a woman with a dream - to one day own a fabulous Dior gown, even though she has no where to actually wear it. In her quest she touchs the lives of several others and makes some true friends. This movie leaves you with a very warm feeling."
5,Mrs. 'Arris,"Very enjoyable film. No questionable sceens and no foul language. The story has elements of love, desire, courage, determination, and a little sweet revenge. There are no killings, no blood, no explosions, and no car chases/wrecks, just a very good film."
5,sassy,i loved this movie angela landsbury was great in this movie i use to have it on vhs but was able to find on dvd on ioffer
2,The Jerk,"Bought this CD only for the song ""The Jerk"" Rest of the Cd wasen't what I expected. But, at least the song I like brought back those old memories."
2,Bama Hack,"Cheap, cheap, cheap, I would hate it if it didnt have bama on it. Cheap white towels with iron-ons, and stiff"
5,"fast shipping, brand new","The shipping on this item was really fast, I bought it brand new with a good price, its a really good book, its easy to understand and helps along the journey to stop pulling you hair out."
2,Not helpful at all,I couldn't even get through this book... not a smooth read at all.... and from what I read there is nothing it can really help you with if you have this Trichotillomania.
2,"not very happy , japanese 5 needle pine bonsai tree","bad points; tree trunk has reverse taper,may never changetree has old scars from wire wrap left on to longI think the tree was poted up very recentgood points; tree arrived safelytree is still alive and growingshipping was quick"
1,Lost in Space,"I always begin reading books with a sense of adventure. It wasn't long before I felt completely lost in a story so banal and so trite that I wondered at my own intelligence since so many people have lauded it. What have I missed? Maybe it's the genre, not my favorite at the best of times. I simply didn't care about Henry and the very precious Clare after a few pages. My willing suspension of disbelief vanished and maybe has shown up in a different time zone. I just hope it comes back!"
4,"Interesting concept, very good book","I saw this book on a table at a bookstore (don't worry Amazon, I didn't buy it there!), and the title caught my eye. When you combine something like time travel and some romance, you've got a book I'm willing to read once. This is a book I'd be willing to read over again. There were times when I had to catch myself, because I felt bewildered along with Henry as to where we were in time, but I enjoyed that connection with the character. I wasn't expecting to get so involved with the story, but it made me cry at the end - which isn't something I often do (and I was crying, not just losing 2 or 3 tears). I recommend it!!!"
5,Waiting with bated breath for Audrey's next book.,"A few years ago, I read this book; I started reading it on a Wednesday afternoon and didn't put it down until late that night. I finished it the next day before work. I have to say I was pulled in immediately from the first paragraph, and it was incredibly compelling and interesting, as I figured it would be, from that point until the very end. Audrey certainly has a way with words and descriptive language. I am waiting for the movie (directed by Gus Van Sant) and am excited about the next novel, set in London. If you have not yet read Time Traveler's Wife, you definitely need to spend some time with this affecting, touching story."
4,"Hard to put down, and dangerous if you do","Great book!!! Rather than go into a review of the book, let me offer up a few suggestions if you decide to pick up this gem.1) Give it some time to get into it. It took me about 50-75 pages to really get my mind around the time travel aspect of the story. Once you figure it out, you'll be hooked.2) Related to #1, I would not try and start reading this book unless you can take the time to get into it and not read it in small doses. This may have been my problem at first, I started reading the book 10-20 pages at a time and that probably caused me to take a bit longer to ""get"" it.3) Plan on having a hard time putting it down in the end. When it is over, you may want to reread it and reread it again."
2,"A plodding, jumbled bore.","A story that could have been with great grace and wit, is instead mashed together and stretched out into an incomprehensible (and overly-long) literary bore."
3,"Pretty good, not great","I like the basic plot idea which is that Claire (the wife) knows Henry (the time traveler) since she was a girl and when they meet in the present she knows him but he doesn't know her yet. See Henry doesn't remember his travels through time, only that he ends up with no shoes and frostbite when he returns. It's a dangerous and unpredictable job this time travel, much like being married to a soldier who goes to Iraq. He leaves and he's gone you worry he will not return home. So sci-fi it is not. Love story it sort of is. But once it explores their married life it wasn't all that interesting in to me. And it's very morose. Time travel is not fun for married people, people! Plus the details of the time travel is spotty at best and the ending wasn't as rewarding as I'd hoped. The writing is good though and it is a book I wanted to read through to the end."
3,"A bit confusing, but a great storyline","""The Time Traveler's Wife"" was a great tale between to people who were destined to be together. The author does a great job of vividly describing each experience and event the two main characters are dealt. It does get a bit confusing when the dates that events are taking place are constantly changing. I read this book in about a week so that I could go see the movie when it came out. The book is a MILLION times better than the movie and you will be disappointed if you read it first. My suggestion is to see the movie (because you won't have any expectations) and then read the book."
3,Tear jerker,"The premise of a man who inexplicably pops in and out of time is clever, as is mixing it with a love story and the complications that ensue. For example, who fell in love with whom? He is drawn to important moments in his life--past and present--so his ""future"" wife meets him long ""before"" he meets her. The love story predominates heavily (-1 star for that). It is a tear jerker (-1 more star). If you like love stories and tear jerkers, this is definitely for you."
2,"Wanted to like it, but didn't","This book certainly came highly recommended and I think the author is definitely very talented and organized the book in a unique way. This is what kept me reading until the end. However, I came away from reading it feeling depressed. Some of the hardships faced by the main characters even brought me to tears, but not in a way I could enjoy. I had other issues with the book, too. The time traveler is severely flawed to the point that I found it hard to imagine any woman falling in love with him, let alone waiting around for him. I had to re-imagine an ending that would show the heroine moving on and living the full life she deserved. This book also rubbed against my personal sensitivity to the overuse of profanity, loveless sex and violence. Those who share these feelings may not like this book. Perhaps this is one of those books that one either loves or hates. That alone may be a sign of its success."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this book. Please !!!,"It is the worst book that I have ever read. Whole story and characters are very shallow, fake and no consistancy at all. Henry sometimes remembers what he has done during his travel and sometimes clueless, just for the convenience of the author. To my opinion, the author wrote this book just for the sake of writing something. Completely waste time to read it !!! Luckily, I borrowed the book from the library. Otherwise, it wastes my hard-earn money too."
2,Overwritten,"At 225 pages in and still nothing had happpened I simply gave up. At first I loved some of the descriptions, but that really is all this book seems to be, a lot of description with very little development. I gave it a fair go, but I'm done and off to find something that will actually capture my imagination and make me want ot turn the page."
4,Wow,How do you keep track of the jumping through time? It was well written and a love story at its core. I could to put it down.
5,AWESOME!!,This book is AWESOME!!! It's the best book I've read in the past decade! I cried three times ... WOW!
1,Rated R for foul language and explicit sex,"I'm not weighing in on anything but the language and sex for those who may want to know. I stopped reading about half way through the book.Foul Language - Lots of the foulest kind.Sex - Lots. Too much information. This is what prompted me to stop reading more than anything.Violence - In the half that I read, there was only one part I considered somewhat violent."
2,"Ho Hum, couldn't finish it","The writing is competent, but after 150 pages, it comes down to ""so what?"" I get it, the guy is a time traveler. Unfortunately nothing much of interest happens during Henry's comings and goings. Five hundred pages of this stuff (Claire is 13, Henry is 43; Claire is 23, Henry is 31) is way too much. It might have worked at half the length, if -- and it's a big if -- a compelling story was also being told. Life is too short to read boring 500 page books. If time travel interests you, read Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut."
3,A Good Vacation Read,"I read this book during a 3-day vacation, and it was, indeed, a page-turner. Unfortunately, the author ended some of the chapters a bit abruptly, as though she was tired of writing, and wanted to be done with it already. While the book began with a somewhat erratic timeline, which really added to the storyline, the narrative quickly gave way to a more normal progression of time, and took something away from the story. All in all, though, a very good, easily digestible read."
5,Avid Reader,"I usually read one book and then open the next one without a thought. I finished this, sat down and had a good cry (which i never do) and spent some time leafing back through the pages to find out what touched me so much. Turns out it was the whole book and the intricate way the author painted a love story."
5,I loved this book!!,"I did not expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. When i first read about the book and the story concept, I thought it would be confusing to follow the characters back and forth through time. Not at all. I completely came to enjoy and love Henry and appreciate the ""gifts"" he gave Clare throughout their life. The book never got dull, and I felt their loss towards the end as if it were my own. Recommend this book highly, and if your new to time travel, get the best of the best -- the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon, they will truly capture your heart."
2,Disappointing - clever with no heart,"The premise of this book is intriguing, but alas, the execution is prosaic. Although curious about the plotting, by the time I was halfway through it felt contrived, and I cared very little for the characters. I fear the author opted for cleverness rather than insight into the longing of the heart. I don't know how old the author is, but if she is young perhaps she will mature into human understanding. Experience sometimes rewards talent in that way. This effort, however was disappointing."
4,Bad ending,"I really loved the beginning of this book, I'm a sucker for love stories and I loved the time traveling twist. I didn't however like the ending and some of the words used, either didn't seem to fit or seemed very crass. All in all though, I did enjoy this book."
1,Boring,"This was the selection for our book club and most of the time I try to read any of the selections through to the end. However, after reading about 100 pages and glancing at the back of the book to see that I would have over 400 pages to go, I gave up the attempt at reading it. I didn't think I could stand someone hopping back and forth through time for that many more pages."
3,Just Go With It,"Although this book was interesting, I ruined it for myself by being skeptical throughout the whole book. I kept waiting for a logical explanation for the supernatural events, thinking it was like A Beautiful Mind. My advice is to just allow yourself to believe the story and you'll enjoy it more."
2,Skip it,"I didn't totally hate this book. The author's version of time travel is an interesting one and the plot is engaging, but I couldn't get past her absurd ""biological"" explanation for time travel. Maybe this is because I'm a biologist, but I thought it would have been better to offer no explanation for the phenomenon at all than the one she gave. It's pretty laughable to propose that a mutation in a single gene, one novel protein, could have the power to transport matter here and there, let alone through time. A quantum or even metaphysical explanation would have been less offensive. Any real sci fi fans will be disappointed by this book because it's really a romance novel with (bad) science fiction as window dressing. As far as love stories go it's not such a great one either. It's explicit sexual descriptions don't draw you in to the human relationship the novel is supposed to be about, they are an unnecessary sideshow."
1,Trapped in Time!,"I feel guilty that I actually suggested this book for my book club. I read so many outstanding things about it. Lies all lies!!! I hated this book. The characters are immature, shallow, self-involved, pseudo-intellectuals with superiority complexes. To top it off, none of the characters are happy with their lives or add anything of value to the world. They have no morals or ethics and they are hypocritical. I wonder if the author has much contact with people - the characters were that unrealistic. It was offensive on many different levels and disturbing - not in the ""it makes you step back and think"" way. The obvious theme of the novel is the concept of entrapment and that was exactly how I felt as I read it - trapped. Don't make the mistake I made and bring it to your book club - they may never trust your judgement again."
1,How is it even possible....,"that over 1,000 people have given this book 5 stars. I cannot even go into how much I disliked this book because it is not worth any more of my time. I have spent enough valuable precious moments on this book. Romance???? HA! Where?! I will give you that it is a ""novel"" idea but my idea of a good book is not reading about a man performing ""favors"" on himself...a woman ""sleeping"" with her husband as an older version sleeps next to her...I can go on and on...but I wont!"
4,Enjoy! it,I enjoy time travel books if they aren't to sci-fi. This one is superb. The humor is right on and the love story is wonderful. It's a long book but well worth the time.
5,Mind Lingering,"I was skeptical about this book since it was my first time travel read, however after I figured out how to follow along with the time skips and delved further into the novel. I found it fascinating, lovely and haunting all at the same time. The imagery in this novel is so clear - it swept me away to those times and places and I didn't want to leave. It's been almost a year since I first read this book and I'm still thinking about it, especially the ending - I want more!! Thanks Audrey!"
5,Timeless Love,"I read this when it came out and decided to read it again when I heard the movie was coming out, and it was just as enjoyable and moving the second time throught it.In The Time Traveller's Wife, Clare has is married to Henry, who redefines a wandering husband as he jumps back and forth through time, often meeting Clare or others that influenced his life, including himself.Throguh this upheavel, they are in love and the story unfolds, back and forth, on how they met and are there for one another. A unique and engaging twist on a love story."
2,Only order if you like Tragedies,"This book had one of the most unsatisfying endings I've ever read. The book overall is well written and kept me turning the pages, but an ending makes or breaks a book. SPOILER: I didn't view the book as a Tragedy until the last page. Henry encounters Clare as an old woman, and before she sees him, he describes her as appearing sad. When she sees him, he describes her as joyful. The implication is that Clare wasted the rest of her life waiting for Henry. That is a tragedy. It means that their love was nothing more than a codependent chain between them. If their love surpassed them to become something larger than themselves, then she could have moved on and lived a life filled with love. I would not recommend this book, and I won't be seeing the movie."
1,I wanted to love this but...,"I was excited about the premise of this book and wanted to love it, but found it unequivocally terrible. The character are flat and underdeveloped. The author constantly tells and never shows. She tells us these characters are soul mates, but I never saw it, or believed it. She tells us they're beautiful and interesting, but they take on no life of their own. I don't know what they loved about each other. Their dreams are small and their interests are each other and that's about it. After spending 10 years whining about wanting a baby, we never see any bond between them and their child. The supporting characters are mere skeletons and everyone's parents are reduced to overdone stereotypes. this book never came alive for me. You want a love story with some power, read Jane Eyre. Skip this."
1,"Dull, cloying and poorly written","It's obvious that a lot of people enjoyed this book, judging from the number of gushing reader reviews here. But with over 500 pages of repetitive, plotless vignettes, how can so many people claim they ""didn't want it to end""? Consider me one reader who wished it had ended much, much sooner. I would not even have bothered to finish it if someone hadn't ordered it for me as a gift.There are so many problems with this novel: a gimmicky set-up, main characters that never feel more than two-dimensional, and choppy vignettes that are less than the sum of their parts. Some of the minority characters seem stereotypically depicted, right down to their speech patterns, which comes off as patronizing on the author's part.In the end, despite the author's own admiration for her hipster creations Henry and Clare, I never cared about them myself. While I wish I could say otherwise, this book is long, dull and annoying. I'm astounded it's as popular as it is."
4,The Time Travellers Wife,"Not a read for those looking for a feel good sci fi/romance. When telling a friend about some of the details of this lengthy, complex tale I realised what a tormenting experience it was. It is a new spin on the time travel idea, cleverly crafted and compelling. I felt flat and drained at the conclusion and am looking for something uplifting to shift the grey cloud of emotional pain this read deposited upon me.There a times where The Man Who Folded Himself is closely shaved but this is the nature of the genre, a strong read that will give those seeking a bit of dementure an avenue to churn upon."
4,"too long, but mostly enjoyable","Stories about time travel are not new, I believe H. G. Wells was the first to tackle this premise with ""The Time Machine"". However, Audrey Niffenegger goes a fine job of making this idea fresh and new in the story of Henry who is a ""time traveler"" who, because of a strange medical condition, is able to ""re-visit"" his and his wife Clare's past and future. Odd, over-lengthy, but very enjoyable tale.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
2,A Script Sold To You as a Book,"Let me warn you -- you're in for pages and pages of one line dialogue like ""I munched my toast."" ""What things never should have been invented?"" Blah blah blah. Somebody at the publishing house paid somebody at the Today Show a lot of money for this endorsement. A time travel romance is an old cliched idea and this one just rambles on for 500 plus pages. People who have raved about this book are probably HUGE Harlequin Romance fans. Grocery Store Junk. Save your money. Check it out at the library if you think you must read it, but don't say I didn't warn you. P.S. Definately a nominee for the BAD SEX WRITING AWARD. BLEEECH."
2,Creepy,"I still am amazed at the popularity of this book. To be honest, I didn't read it all the way through because it creeped me out so much when the main character ""visited"" himself in youth. I attempted to keep reading, but it just kept getting more & more bizarre. Finally, I just put it down and didn't ever think twice about picking it back up. Good books make you want to continue reading... this book made me want to stop."
3,"A replay of ""Replay""","I liked this book a lot better when it was written by Ken Grimwood and called ""Replay."" That 1986 book was funny and wise and thrilling; this one is a pretty good knock-off."
5,An Altruistic Tale of Timeless Love and Infinite Devotion,"One of the most engaging, yet unconventional, love stories of our time. Henry and Clare, extraordinary soul mates, share only random ephemeral chronologically displaced moments, yet possess a love that far exceeds the limitations of time and circumstance. A true gem and an unforgettable lesson in unbridled admiration and immeasurable selflessness."
2,Starts great and fades,The book has an interesting plot. It starts wonderfully and I had real hope even when the story took a dive. Really not worth the read....
1,Boring,"This book was recommended to me by someone who I thought might know a good book, and I've heard so many raves about it. I couldn't believe I was reading the same book. At first I thought I just had to give it time, that I'd ""get"" it after awhile. I never did. I could care less about the characters and I really just didn't care what happened to them.I will never blindly take some one else's recommendation again.BORING."
2,Just okay.,"The premise is fascinating, but the characters are unpleasant and flat. What could be a terrific story, with elements of suspense, romance, mystery, drama, and comedy, actually comes off as a shoddily pieced together attempt that lacks a real story. The author's attempt at depth and meaning is wimpy and the characters are irritating pseudo-intellectuals with a total lack of common sense. It's impossible to sympathize with either of them. I'd say this might be entertaining, but it is definitely not what some of these reviews make it out to be. Try ""The Dive From Clausen's Pier"" instead."
1,What a non-event,"The Time Traveler's Wife is such a confusing mishmash of events, that I lost interest very quickly. I read it for a book club, and that's the only reason I stayed with it. I'm all for suspending disbelief, and not nitpicking about details, but the story bounces all over the place, just as Henry bounces between different universes. It's supposed to be a love story, but I never found the attraction compelling. Clare was an impressionable child when she met Henry, and felt destined to be his wife. Frankly, I got tired of trying to sort out when events took place, and if the book were interesting I'd never have cared about the chronology at all. By the time I was halfway through the book I was completely tired of these folks. And I never was engaged enough to suspend my disbelief about time travel."
2,Let Down,"I was really excited to read this book after I saw the movie trailer for it.It's a good idea and could have been much more creative and easier to follow, if it had been written better. Sometimes it's very confusing and I found myself having to go back and re-read the sentance/paragraph to figure it out. I nearly threw the book away, but gave it one more chance to see where it was leading and how it ended. It was challenging to keep going.There is a lot of crudeness, un-needed mentioned sex, and profanity which totally could have been left out. It was difficult to really get close to the characters due to lack of real emotional description.I was disappointed and hope the movie is better."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I love anything to do with time travel whether in books or movies. I would have given this book five stars for the excellent story. The reason for the four star rating is the use of the ""C"" word to describe genitalia...both Clair's and Henry's. While I'm definately NOT a prude, I could have lived without having them in the book. Other than that, a great read that I couldn't put down."
1,the time traveler's boring tale,This was another case of the reviews being way off the mark..this book was simply awful. One of the reasons was that every couple of pages you are reading about yet another moment in time. Way too confusing and uninteresting.
2,Didn't like it,"the story is all over the place. Not organized which makes it really hard to follow.After 150 pgs, the author still didnt get to the point."
1,needs serious editing!!,"Ugh. This book needs some serious editing. There may be an interesting story in there and the concept is good, but it's painful to get through it. A good editor could easily cut out half the pages. There's so many times where the book reads like someone's daily account of activities - got up, took a shower, got dressed, doorbell rang, etc. Stuff that adds nothing what so ever to the story. As a result, the characters are pretty flat. If you need something to help you pass a lot of time or you like crappy chik-lit, then read it. Otherwise - leave this one on the shelf."
3,"Original, smooth and romantic but too flat and somehow problematic","The novel's sci-fi time-travel theme surprisingly work well with its romantic element. The author tends to focus on the Roman and avoid explaining too much about the science part, which is one of the reasons that make the novel favorable. However, as several readers mention in their reviews, the characters are too flat, the narratives too detailed, and the novel is way too long. Most of the incidents in the novel do not connect one another, and there is nearly no memorable scenes in the first half of the book. For me, the biggest problem is that, even though the novel is narrated by the two leading characters, they totally sound the same, with totally same tone and wording. If you want to do multiple narrators and stream of consciousness, you'd better make it sound authentic, not just switch the narrators with the same writing style.However, the book is still a fun read."
5,What an amazing book,"One thing that I've always enjoyed is a good book. A book that I can't put down, and can't stop thinking about after I have finished with it. The Time Traveler's Wife was just that type of book. I highly recommend it for anyone who is intrested in a good love story."
4,Let Go of Time and Read the Book,"I found this book difficult to get into at first since the reader has to let go of the traditional concept of time and just go with the flow. After releasing my initial urge to take notes to keep things straight, I just let myself read it and ended up really enjoying the story."
5,enjoyed this way more than i thought i would...,"I just didn't think I would be able to get into the time traveling part of it. The first few pages I still had my doubts, but I heard such good things about the book, I continued on. And really enjoyed it! Some advice: you really can't put it down and come back in a few days. It's easy to follow if you read it all together. Like another reader said--I carried it with me everywhere! It was gut wrenching towards the end...unbelievably heartbreaking. I cried. Was reading late at nite and almost woke my husband up to hug him. What a read!"
2,Why all the Hype?,"I just couldn't get into this book, even though I'm a huge time travel fan, maybe because I saw the movie first. Actually preferred the movie. At least it moved the story along, whereas the book was long winded and dull. Couldn't finish it since i already knew how the story ended.Overall the idea was great, with a different take on time traavel."
5,Awesome!,"Ok, so like this book took some real thinking. Seriously, someone had to keep a time table or something because wow!After reading it a second time, I give it a 5 star review, I totally cried! It was so good! I was pulled in, hooked and taken over by this book."
2,Read Jack Finney Instead,"I, too, wanted to like this book, but in the end, just didn't. My main problem is the complete failure of Claire's internal logic regarding subjecting a child to the same dreadful existence as her husband's. They show up naked in strange places, for God's sake! The novel is an oddly amateurish effort, and I can't recommend it (very weak dialog, plotting, all those pretentious references to punk bands, and the unforgivable ""beamish boy""...who talks like that?) For really good time travel, buy Jack Finney's Time and Again and From Time to Time. For weird genetic anomalies, try Max Tivoli - great story and utterly lyrical. Skip this one."
1,When the writing technique drowns a story..,Then you are focusing on the whys and wheres and not the characters. I give her a one star for being creative about the time travel idea..but as a novel..this is horrible. The story is lost in craft..and after a while the reader could care less.
1,"Smug, Shallow and Gratuitously Dramatic","This terrible book is an incredibly frustrating waste of time! I finished it only because it is my book club's selection this month. When I was done I threw it across the room. 500 + pages and you never get to know anything that matters about the main characters -- just page after page after page of disconnected dramatic happenings and ridiculous situations. I was more than willing to go with a ""time traveling"" story line, but even science fiction needs some substance to make a story interesting. Don't believe the hype -- SKIP IT."
2,"An interesting premise, and a story I wanted to like.....","All time travelling books require a complete suspension of disbelief, but this one just became too weird for me. Whenever I'm reading about a 40 year old time travelling man appearing naked before his six year old ""future wife"" I can't help but be creeped out! Plus the author seemed to make glaring factual errors that grated on me (eg. A Bellini cocktail is made with peach juice not pear, and since when did most cars in the late fifties/early sixties even have seat belts let alone ones that were actually used?)I found the dialogue cliched, the writing mediocre, and the characters just plain dull. I hate to take the ""unpopular"" road here, but this one came across as overhyped drivel."
1,Can't even finish it,"Can someone please give me a good reason to finish this book? I am chugging and chugging and I just can't make it. It just seems so flat to me...the scenes, the characters...everything. I just want to bring the train into the station but I can't do it."
3,200 pages too long,"I really enjoyed the book at the beginning, but about 300 pages into it the vignettes started to lose purpose. I found the climax to be convoluded and confusing. Without giving too much away, I'm not quite sute why Clare is not really angray at her dad and brother. Characters are developed to a degree, but there is too much information left out to fully explain certain people's motivations. Part of the problem is that the book is a bit of a tease. It keeps you interested enough, thinking there will be a payoff in a few pages, and the payoff never quite happens. The ending is quite anticlimactic and disappointing."
3,So-so,"Interesting idea, characters not very well developed, and a large, obvious, glaring (at least to me) plot error near the end that pretty much ruined the book for me."
3,It Is What It Is!,"I just finished this book, and found it pretty enjoyable. I agree that the characters are a little unbelievable in their emotional response to the things that happen, (especially Claire, who I couldn't relate to at all!) but the book was a fun read. It didn't lead me to any huge revelations about the meaning of life or love, but I guess I wasn't looking for that in the first place. You will enjoy this book if you don't expect it to change your life! Actually, I think it would make a better movie than book, which is weird because I always like books better than movies!I hated the ending. . .can you say ""Somewhere in Time""???"
2,romance novel... enough said,This book is probably great for those that like romance novels. My problem is that I thought it was an adventure book based on the time machine movie with Mr. Depp. Unfortunately I couldn't finish the book because it was too slow of a read for me. I should have researched the book category. My bad.
2,Time Traveler's Wire,"I am not enjoying this book at all. I am very disappointed. I have stopped reading it due to lack of interest,and wish I could get a refund."
5,I don't want to say goodbye!,"Wow...I haven't read a book that good in ages. I was so moved by these characters, at how real they felt. It feels as though I should be able to turn around and find Clare or Henry sitting in the next room. I didn't want the book to end and when it did I was in tears. Beautifully written, I read it in four days but very glad I was at home to finish it."
2,"great idea, just not a good book","well, here is another book for the ""great idea, just not a great book"" file! ms. niffenegger had an original idea, however, she became too wrapped up in writing about punk rock, sex and anarchy. if i had to read another preachy passage about any of the above mentioned topics, i was close to wishing i could travel to the future (just to be done with the book). i didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. i understand ms. niffenegger is an artist... she should stick with art."
1,I want to travel back in time to when i didn't read this book,"This book is simply awful. I waited and waited for it to turn good, but never - even the end is rather pathetic.The premise itself isn't a bad one, but there is too much time spent in droning detail of inconsequential events, whilst the storyline turns stagnant.Save your time, pass on this one."
2,Confusing,"I like a challenging novel with a complicated plot, but this book for me crossed the line into hopelessly confusing and I put it down halfway through. Maybe I just didn't care for the characters enough to put the energy into figuring it out."
2,"intrigued, but just got bored...","this was a book club pick for our book club and no one really loved it. Only 2 gals actually finished it - it is VERY VERY long. I read about one half and just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Had to jump around a few times to remember how old everyone was. Maybe I just missed the boat, since a LOT of folks obviously liked it. But no one in our group really loved it."
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME; STRANGE!,"I purchased this book when I saw the previews for the movie and I thought I'd read the book first. I received it very fast from Amazon but when I started reading it I realized the book was going nowhere! It was very confusing to read; jumped all over the place with dates, etc. and the characters were not developed throughout this dry story. I felt weird even reading it and I definitely will not go to see the movie. There are descriptions of love scenes that are completely out of place and tasteless. I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend this book; it was a complete disappointment!"
5,Don't Let the Title Fool You,"This novel is NOT Sci-Fi although it is often referred to as such. This is literary fiction and a truly original and gripping love story. You'll find it hard to put down once you start reading.I've heard that the publishers had trouble marketing this book at first because they didn't know how to categorize it. It's Literary Fiction with the interesting twist of believable time travel and a love story that will touch your heart and leave you in tears.The only thing I can think of to compare it to is the movie ""Somewhere in Time"". If you liked the movie, this book is a must READ.If you're looking for fantasy and wizards, this is not the book for you."
2,couldn't get through it,"This book came highly recommended so I really was excited when I bought it and first started to read it. I kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't. I abandoned it about 1/2 way through..maybe if I get really bored I'll try to plow through and hope it improves. Nothing seems to happen. Henry disappears, reappears at various times, but nothing really happens. BORRRRING... And I really wanted to like it. :-("
2,I really tried to like it...,"I wanted to like this book, really I did...especially after seeing the movie trailer. The premise is intriguing. However, I found the book to be a bit confusing since the ""time traveler"" appeared as child & adult at the same time and different ages while other characters remained the same age in the current year. Are you confused yet? I tried looking past that, but just couldn't get past the laborious, unnecessary details regarding mundane events. Okay, I'll just say it - BORING! I found myself skimming through the monotony and finally gave up on the book altogether -- something I never do. I'm really disappointed and hope, for once, that the movie is better than the book!"
3,Light reading,"The clever and complex premise of a man time traveling to different parts of his life gives some interest to an otherwise dull story.The love story between Clare and Henry is trite: two beautiful, intelligent and hip people are in love. And they're rich, too, thanks to Henry's ability to peek at future stock values and lottery numbers. Other than their perfection, there is no explanation as to why they fall in love. As they are both perfect from the get-go, there's no character development. True, Henry is portrayed as a wild boy who straightens up when he meets his true love Clare. But this is just to enhance his manly appeal. The archetypal Romeo, after all, wouldn't be a geeky virgin.Still, the writing is fairly good and the story cruises along, thank goodness, since I had to read it for my book club."
4,"Great story, horrid ending","This was such an amazing and thought provoking story, with well developed characters that you can't help but love and hope for. However, after listening to it on tape for many, many hours over a period of more than a year, both my husband and I were horrified at the pathetic and superficial ending. Claire is this amazingly beautiful, talented, intelligent, alive woman, who winds up spending her entire life waiting for one more visit from Henry! This just does NOT fit with her character and we both felt misled and irritated that we hung on for so many hours only to be let down and dropped at the end and that Claire turns out to be just a desperate housewife."
5,"Ingenious, creative, brilliant.","I can't stop thinking about this book. I feel kind of depressed that I finished it and don't get to read it anymore! Now, I'm afraid to pick up another book, because I know it will pale in comparison. I agree that at times there was too much detail, like describing in excurciating detail, the paper art process. But, being detail-oriented myself, I liked hearing what they ate, what groceries they were buying, what songs were played at a concert. It made it real to me. Also, being from Chicago, I liked to hear about which streets they were on, and all the tidbits about different Chitown neighborhoods. I miss Clare and Henry!!"
4,great read,I loved this book once I figured out the format...It pulls you in and wont let go. I won't post a spoiler but I will say I put off reading the last few sections for a while just because I knew what was about to happen and I didn't want it to!!!
1,Ugg,"I'm probably the only person in the world who utterly hated this book. The main female character made me so angry with her incredibly spoiled tantrums that I wanted to throw the book across the room. I couldn't figure out why Mr. Time Traveler wouldn't pick another woman who wasn't as annoying. Plus, I adore science fiction and interesting stories that challenge the reader, but this one was just trite and pointless. It is a simple ""romance"" type book disguised as something more sophisticated. I just don't understand why this book has become so popular - people must be just hungry for something different. However, there are hundreds of excellent and thought provoking books out there that are labelled science fiction - check out the Hugo and Nebula lists!"
1,Incredibly dull,"I've been listening to the unabridged audio recording on my ipod, and I have to stop: this has been one of the dullest literary experiences of my life. I read a lot of fiction, and I thought that maybe the audio performance was the problem. Last night, I gave up in disgust as I listened to the most banal dialogue that I can remember in a book. I don't need action to keep me interested, but the characters, narrative, and dialogue were so boring. With all of the positive reviews, there must be something of substance here, but I can't make myself push through it."
2,Huge Letdown,"This book has absolutely the most disappointing ending for a book of its depth and length and not because of the character's fate but because it was just plain ridiculous. I think the author fell victim to writer's block, slacked on some primary character development and robbed me of the several hours it took to complete the book only to reach an end with no substance whatsoever. Save your money."
1,Disappointed,"I picked up this book after looking for recommendations from people who loved Kite Runner (amazing read!) on this site and I just couldn't see what is so special about Time Traveler's Wife. I forced myself to read, was hoping for something to happen but had to stop 3/4 of the way. Coulnd't go on. I had no sympathy for the characters, found the humor was bland, and thought that if the author cut down a bit it would have had a better impact."
1,Shallow and Zero Plot!,"Really, I don't know how anyone could give this book a good rating. Obviously it's a love story, but it's so boring. The characters are shallow. There is more intrigue in reading a dictionary. The book is a series of events that have no impact on the characters. It's like a diary that niether impacts or shapes the plot of the story. There are no twists or tense moments. It's just plain dull and pointless reading."
1,Disturbing,"Although I found the plot of Time Traveler's Wife compelling, I found the crude and graphic sex scene between an 18 year old girl and 40 something year old man revolting. The frequent use of the ""F bomb"" was another turn off. This book could have been so much better if the characters had more virtue and if their sex lives weren't described over and over."
2,I don't understand what all the fuss is about,"I love the idea of this book, and know so many people who loved it. However, I could not finish it. I tried so many times and it just felt endless to me... I just didn't care! I had trouble even watching the movie even though it was well acted and had beautiful people starring in it. I guess I just didn't really like the characters and didn't feel their romance at all. I like the logic of the plot line and think the story has potential to be wildly romantic or even just more emotional. However, it just wasn't. Read the synopsis, see the movie, spare yourself some time."
5,I can't wait to read The Time Traveler's Daughter,"This book is original and well written, and hugely enjoyable. Henry is a flawed hero and this makes his character all the more engaging. Audrey Niffenegger hooks you into the characters from the start and keeps you with them all the way to the end. The story line not only keeps you wanting to know what happens next, but also what happened last. I hope the author decides to write ""The Time Traveler's Daughter"""
3,The Time Traveler's Wife,"This was a book club selection and for the most part has been a pleasurable read. Excellent character development and writing style are essential to a successful read. The author did well given the format of the book. The characters make you laugh. They make you cry, eliciting an emotional response, which is good.The negative comes with the editing. There is constant shifting of the narrative, which becomes annoying. I found myself having to look back to see which character was speaking and at what age he/she currently is.There is a tendency in current media practices to add pizzazz and bling to attract the reader/viewer. More is not better. It becomes distracting, making it easy to put the book down and subsequently forgotten.P. E. - Kenosha, WI"
3,"It was ok, but...","...the love story seemed to get lost in the theme of time travel. Reading this book, I never felt as if Henry and Clare really loved and chose each other (and in my opinion, choice is essential to love). Rather, I felt that Clare loved Henry because she had been told all her life that she would, and Henry loved Clare because she told him that they would be married in the future. It seemed that the two of them placidly followed the path that destiny appeared to have lain out for them rather than truly living, and that left me cold.Despite this, the author managed to keep the story moving at a pace that kept me engaged, which is more than I can say for many authors."
3,Much darker that I expected...and slow.,"I am not going to say that I did not like this book, but it was very hard to get into (not until about 1/2 way through it was I interested) and very slow. I was so excited about this book when I saw the previews for the movie I ran out and bought the book. It looked like it would be a great love story with a twist, but I didn't think it was a love story at all, but more about a man that time travels. The book was much darker that I thought also. It was an ok book, but I would not recommend it to anyone and I could have lived without ever reading it. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I hope it is better than the book.If you want a love story with a twist...read Twilight. I could not put that book down!"
5,Loved the story!,"I loved this love story! Great writing, it makes you cry, it makes you wonder and it makes you laugh. Read the book before you see the movie."
1,good idea; bad book,"I'm in the minority I see. However entralling the idea of time travel is this book missed the mark. First it was disjointed. So much so in fact, that I'm still not even sure how Henry died. Secondly, the characters were not likable - none of them. I just didn't care about any of the characters - main or subplot. They were vulgar, disgusting people who used others when they wished and used alcohol, drugs, and profanity to excess. Thirdly, the overuse of profanity was pointless. People I know do not talk like these people (especially in front of their children). Fourth, the sex talk was uncalled for; it was too graphic. Fifth, this has been hyped as a love story. I say it's no where near a love story. And if this is what the author thinks is love then no wonder she missed the mark. A sad tale that could have been very interesting."
2,Can't wait to finish reading this book.,not because it was such a great book but because it was an ANNOYING book. No character development. No REAL story. Same thing over and over and over again. I can't believe the author chose to waste people's time and money by writing this book- the author is probably the only person in the world who understands 70% of the references in the book- from the french/german poetry to the Chicago streets to the music references...how self centered. Don't read this book- you'll only be annoyed and I'm still not done. Only reason I give it a 2 star is because the idea of time travel is good but the author couldn't even solidify that concept- it didn't make sense most of the time.
2,Waste of time,"The only thing original about this typical love story was the fact that the guy could time travel. In my opinion, the book was confusing and not well written. If you are going to spend any money on this story, go see the movie and save yourself hours of agony trying to read the novel."
2,Pretentious and annoying.,"What is up with the lists of punk rock bands?? and all this 'let's get our kit off and have a romp' business?? we GET IT. Clare and Henry have alot of sex. can we talk about something else now. I hated their friends -- Gomez and his girlfriend (i can't even remember her name now. she was THAT superfluous as a character.) -- pseudointellectual yuppie types with no real depth or purpose. And then the untranslated German and French quotations and poems..why?? Okay okay you work in a library and read alot. Your wife makes paper. UGHHH. Book was also unnecessarily looong and plodding..did we really need to describe things in such painfully unbearable detail? The ending was also a bit of a let-down.In short, an interesting concept (i obviously bought into the hype) but i would be quite happy to sell this to someone else."
1,I was unable to finish this book,"I love the time traveling idea, but, after trying to read this on three separate occasions, I have given up. I really did not care for the author's writing style and just found some of the situations between the two main characters to be bothersome."
4,The Time Traveler's Wife reviewed by The Book Vixen,"Wow! And this is Audrey Niffenegger's debut book? I am amazed. This is a fabulous read! The concept of the storyline seems complex but Audrey puts it together nicely and makes it easy for the reader to follow the time line. Have the tissues ready!I saw the movie before I read the book, not something I would have normally done but I'm glad it worked out that way. Seeing the movie first allowed me to have a visual of the time line; you get to see everything fall together in place. I wish they would have incorporated the last scene from the book into the movie."
4,Glad I Stayed With It,"The first part is too cute and clever. It seemed that an effort was made to splice literary and philosophical references into a hip lifestyle in Chicago. It read like a movie script... (and some producer thought so too) and I almost put it down.After reading an Amazon review saying ""strong finish"", and it being a pleasant and quick read, I continued. Somewhere around p. 200 the author hits her stride. I don't know if this is an actual quality of the text, or of the reader becoming more comfortable with the characters and the concepts presented. Around p. 200, you start to care about Claire, Henry and later Alba, feeling at turns happy and sad with them. The book makes you think about life, lifespans, time and loss.Were the sex eliminated, this could be a blockbuster children's book or series."
2,"Couldn't finish this, didn't care...","I went to see the movie before I read the book. I was able to get through half the book until I just didn't care anymore. I love to read, but this was too bogged down with description. I thought it was me, but after loaning out the book to someone else that loves to read I realized that it wasn't just me. She couldn't get through the book either!! So, I can only give this two stars because the book just dragged on and on."
2,I don't understand why this book is so popular,I heard so many good things about this book from different people and even when I checked it out at the library the librarian said it was one of her all-time favorite books. I had a hard time getting into the book. The characters were flat and the book was not very exciting in my opinion; it was too random. I just kept waiting for something to happen to justify all the praise it received. It ended kind of sweet but it was also very sad. I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought it was not a great read.
5,Extraordinary!,"One of the best books I have read in a long time. I thought this book was amazing and I totally fell in love with the characters and the unusual and compelling story. The concept of ""time travelling"" sounds weird at first but once you get to know the characters and get caught up in their love story, it doesn't seem strange at all. At the heart of this wonderful book is an amazing love story that made me laugh and cry more than a few times and I was sorry to see it end. When I was finished reading it, I wanted to read it all over again. Highly recommended!"
2,"Good entertainment, bad writing","I gave this book two stars because the topic of the book was a great idea. Also I applaud the author for getting her first book published. But... The characters have no depth to their personalities, they are not flawed or personable which makes the book quite hard to get through. There was nothing about the book that made me want more, which saddens me because I was quite looking forward to reading it. I would honestly compare the writing style to that of the Twilight series, (which yes, I admit I did read). This book would be better geared to younger readers."
2,Too much work,"Reading this book, I felt like I was reading a thesis on the cause and effects of macular degeneration or some other medical condition. It's too smart for it's own good ... the following back and forth through time got very boring after about the fourth chapter. Perhaps it was just the story line that didn't really hold my interest."
3,Is life just a play that has already been written ?,"I enjoyed reading this book. However, I disagree with the authors premise that fate cannot be changed. Henry is unable to alter his future when he returns to the past. The reason given is that ""it has already happened and has to happen again the same way"". In most other time travel stories, the traveler can change the course of events. I would rather believe that we have free will to determine our own destinies, not that they are predetermined and unchangeable thru any choices we make, or actions we take."
2,I kept reading to get to the point...,"...but I gave up 2/3 through the book. I seldom give up on a book, but this one just rambled on and on."
3,TRAVELING BOOK,Purchased for daughter for Valentine. She states that bookwas not as interesting (plot hard to follow)as thought would be.She donated to school library.
2,Just OK,"This book is a difficult read. Time going back and forth for one of the characters, a lot of lulls in the story and an OK ending. Not realistic and a little to far out there for me."
3,Disappointed,"I got this book because a lot of my friends were raving about it. It's a good story, but it wasn't that great.Also there's random French phrases in the book and I don't know any French so that was distracting."
5,Great!,Everything was perfect. Sorry for the late feedback. The book was just as describe in great conditions and fast shipping!
4,Engaging and fun to read,"I liked this book - it has its flaws but overall was enjoyable to read with a touching ending that made the less-than-perfect story worth the reading. The flaws? Too many time travel sequences. After the first 20 or 30, we get the idea but they keep coming on and on, sometimes not moving the story ahead at all. The genetics issues are absurd - much of that whole thing just gets in the way, to me anyway. But the connection between Clare and Henry I thought was strong enough to overcome the minor flaws, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying the book.4 out of 5 stars - well worth the time to read."
4,The Time Traveler's Wife,"From the first chapter I found this book to be riviting, unique in concept, and an easy, wonderful read."
5,WOW!,that's all I can say!!!!! this book is superb I could not put it down! Great love and touching story!!! I wish I could give it 20 stars!!!!
3,Touching,"This book was very different than any others I have read. I really enjoyed it, although sometimes the descriptiveness of the author was a little much. The story of Henry and Clare and their love, literally over a lifetime was original and intresting. It was a little confusing at times with all the time traveling, but I liked how the author tied events together over time. In the end, this is a love story about a man with a time traveling affliction and the woman who stand by him through it all."
1,Can't finish this book,"I know everyone loves this book, but I've forced myself to get 60% of the way through it and can't go on. I love the time travel idea, but the love story is so contrived I want to gag. Oh, they're so in love, so good-looking, and have so much sex...everything would be perfect if only Henry didn't keep time-traveling all the time. Barf!There's really just not enough character development to make the characters believable. We're supposed to buy that they're incredibly in love without seeing much development of the romance...they were fated to be together and that's apparently supposed to be enough.When reading this book, I feel extremely aware that I am reading a book. It just feels forced."
2,I Wanted to Like It...,"I really wanted to like this book. A friend lent it to me, so I could read it before seeing the movie with her. I agree that it's an interesting premise. I enjoyed some of the beginning, but, as some reviewers have said, it lost me towards the middle. The reason may be that once you figure out what's going to happen, the books slogs towards the inevitable. The worldview of this book is that you can't change what's going to happen. No matter what you know beforehand, or what actions you take, our fate is sealed and we are merely puppets acting out a play that's already been written. No one in this story had a choice in what would happen to them. That does not make for interesting fiction, or a vibrant life. I want to think that the decisions I make have consequences, that what I do has meaning. I felt Henry and Clare were just going through the motions, and I didn't care what happened to them and no interest in seeing the movie."
5,Starts out slow but give it a chance!,"I was so dissapointed that I bought this book when I started the first few pages, but it definitely picked up and by the time I finished it became one of my favorites that I reccommend to all my friends.Its definitely worth checking out!"
2,Didn't pull me in,"To me, the definition of a good book is one that sucks you in to their world and that you can identify or sympathize with the characters. In my opinion, this is not a good book. Spoiler alert! There are so many holes in the premise that it's impossible to suspend disbelief. Earlier reviews mentioned a lack of the outside world, that it's like they're in a cocoon- that's exactly it. Forget all the questions of ""couldn't more people have seen him disappear"", ""why didn't his time travel skills make headline news"", etc.- because you'll be disappointed. The characters are detestable and selfish. And if you buy the whole premise of the book and do get sucked in to this world- it's incredibly sad if you think about it. The creative writing was the only redeeming quality."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I read this book because of a book club that I recently joined and was apprehensive at first because it was not a book I would have picked out on my own, but once I read the first few pages I was hooked. The story is wonderfully refreshing; not your typical love story. The time travel can get a bit confusing but it's not so bad that I would put the book down. It could have been a bit shorter and it would still have been a good book. I have ordered myself a first edition hardcover to add to my collection of favorites."
2,Big build up . . . . small pay off,"I wanted to love this book and, if a few things had been different, I would have. Niffenegger comes up with a very clever premise and she's skilled at creating good characters. The non-linear plot took some getting used to, but after a while I was very much enjoying the time shifts and seeing the many pieces of the puzzle start to fall into place.The problem with The Time Traveler's Wife is the last quarter. After hundreds of pages of build up this book just sort of peters out. I've been disappointed with a number of books lately for this reason (Forever and Everything Is Illuminated are two that spring to mind). Good premise, decent writing, but an ending that just renders the whole thing a waste of time.Niffenegger is talented, there's no question. But it almost seems as though she got fed up with her own book and just hastily threw together an ending. Poorly executed and extremely disappointing for the reader."
3,Original but the characters needed deeper development,"The story is a very original concept and is told in a cohesive manner. However, aside from Henry and Clare, the characters are very sparsely developed. The love story and interplay between Henry and his daugher did make me appreciate the time I have with my spouse and children more and really reminded me that I can never take that time for granted."
3,"some good, some bad","I agree with the ""ups and downs"" review. I feel that there was too much sex and too many useless details in this book. The storyline (once you muck through the beginning) was pretty interesting. For a better sci-fi read, I would recommend The Giver by Lois Lowery."
3,An average book in the Time Travel genre,"I've read better time travel books. This book just didn't hold my attention and I found it oddly amusing that it read just as well back to front as it does front to back. It just seems like the author took all her ideas for the plot, wrote them down on index cards and then tossed the whole lot up in the air and then wrote the book down in the order that she picked the cards up. There's never a compelling reason given for why Henry is so fascinated by Clare or why she so obediently decides to wait for him. The only really interesting character is Alba and she doesn't show up until the last third of the book."
3,Mixed thoughts on this book,"The story itself was good. Some things written seemed to contradict and caused me question and re-read sections to find out the author just didn't really think it through completely or left out the necessary details to fill those gaps. Overall, the book held my interest. I could have done without all the language and sex. I did like the ending, and how it tied up and I liked how it was written from two perspectives. If time travel and love are your cup of tea then read it, otherwise, if you're detailed and logical you may find it annoying at several points. Not a book I would recommend, but it isn't my type of book either, just reading through a stack of recommended books from friends."
2,Is this really our best this year?,"No doubt it's an orginal storyline, but the syrupy and static love-story is hampered by underdeveloped characters, overwritten description and unbelievable dialogue. As an advocate for literary fiction I have to ask: is this really the best we're going to read this year?"
4,Clever and thought provoking,"I had high expectations for this book based on its reviews. I thought it was a slow start. I kept putting it down and picking it up every few day. I'm glad I persevered. Midway through it became interesting and I started getting into the story and thinking about Henry's timetravelling and its impact on people. I wondered how it was possible for Henry to be talking to himself. How could they be friends with Gomez? What happens to Alba? I agree with another reviewer that the story was a bit creepy too. Clare's devotion to Henry was romantic yet odd to me. I mean, she first meets him at age 6 and Henry appears in his mid thirties (I think). Each time she sees him he's aged differently. Clare's childhood and adolesence are so screwed up because of him. This would be a great book to discuss at a book club because there are so many questions one could talk about."
1,536 pages of really bad writing,"I had high hopes: attractive green jacket, ""national bestseller"", intriguing description, photo of author with flowing hair, looking wistful. Warning: reading this book is like reading exerpts from the diaries of the two most boring people you know. this is a writer who insists on overwriting with aimless details. if you read this book and think that it is torture it is NOT because you are too stupid to follow the ""time traveling"" chronology. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is grating at best and you start hating everything about this book about a third of the way through, especially the fact that you spent $15 on it."
2,A cheesy lovestory,"A predictable cheesy love story where the concept of time travel was interesting but the delivery of it failed. Because of the abrupt changes in view points, and mere descriptions of the moment in time, you never really connect with the characters."
4,The Time Traveler's Wife,I really enjoyed this book. I sometimes got a little confused with some of the time traveling but slowly figured it out. I usually am not interested in love stories but this book had so much more then a regular love story. I highly recommend it!
1,Godawful,"I suspect that time will eventually forget Niffenegger's debut, _The Time Traveler's Wife_ in the same way that it has forgotten the stacks of Jackie Collins and Jilly Cooper novels currently weighing down the shelves at my local Village Thrift. To be fair to a first novel, one might overlook the sloppy writing, slapdash editing, undercooked characters and total disregard for setting and place, but the painfully bad grammar and immature rhetoric made this novel a fairly uncomfortable read.Though the storyline is a cracking one and the plot moves fairly quickly, _The Time Traveler's Wife_ is a thoroughly amateur effort, and I am only grateful that it took so little time to read. Perhaps Niffenegger should stick to printmaking and leave the real writing to professionals. Looking forward to seeing this one in the discount bin."
2,A bit creepy,"Not really my 'cuppa' at all. I was somewhat enjoying it until I got to a really creepy part in the book about being with 'himself' which I found, I don't know, strange. The rest of it seemed slow and just wasn't what I thought it was going to be."
1,Waste of Time,"This book got so much hype and yet I found it ridiculous. Unfortunately I saved this book for a vacation and would have stopped reading it in the beginning if I could have found any other books in English. The concept is so un-realistic and the characters aren't even likeable. Every single chapter is the same exact thing just a different time frame - and this goes on for what feels like millions of pages. Why would I want to read about someone who can time travel and uses this ""gift"" to steal, fight and cheat at winning the lottery? It's too long, too shallow, and too simple of a story that could have had more potential to be interesting on this topic. I only wish I could travel back in time and brought a different book with me on vacation."
2,Ewwww.,"I thought this book had a lot of potential--the concept was well developed and the over all chronology immaculately organized. The circular meetings were both confusing and perfectly clear. And yet... I found the book to be over the top with sexual description. It wasn't romantic, it was vulgar. Moreover, the author takes the most sensitive and pure character in the book (Clare, although I suppose Alba really is) and makes her pathetic and weak (and somewhat slutty) in the end. The affair with Gomez? Sure, it was brief, but it was disgustingly graphic, a moment of pure weakness on Clare's part, and incredibly self centered (isn't Charisse Clare's friend??). I think I might have overcome the other vulgarity if it weren't for the decimation of Clare's character in the end."
2,"Good Love Story, too Graphic for me",I liked the idea behind this story. It was a great idea of Love enduring through time. I really like the character emotion expressed. What i didn't like was all the graphic sex scenes. I don't want to read that. I know everyone thinks I'm a prude but it seemed to me that as a new author she did not know what to do with the story so enter another sex scene. We can get the idea of enduring great love with out all the details. So I would not recommend this book to other readers who don't want to read a story that should have been a harlequin romance novel. And I hope the author will grow in her story telling ability for her next book.
1,A terrible disappointment,"I bought this book about six months ago and wanted to finish before the movie. I have been avoiding trailers like the plague and finally got motivated to finish reading it. What a waste of time. There is no development in plot and there is no advancement to most of Henry's time traveling. The language was crude and sexual content was completely random and not conducive to the story line. I literally skipped four chapters and still hadn't missed anything. (Yes I went back and read them, but I wanted to see if I would miss anything) As a woman who has suffered multiple miscarriages, I was unimpressed with all the lost children in this book. It served no purpose. It was just plain disturbing. Overall, this was a terribly written book. See the movie first, then if you are still interested, venture at your own risk. I DO NOT recommend this book."
5,"Amazing, MUST read book!!","What an amazing first novel for Audrey Niffenegger. The format, plot twists and story line were mesmerizing. This was an emotional roller coaster of a book & is now one of my favorite novels of all time. I definitely recommend this to anyone who longs for or has found the love of their lives."
4,Great story....,"It's a very good read, much more sophisticated that I'd expected. Very sad ending :("
3,Good Summer Read,"This is a good summer read and a nice love story - I think the sex parts worked perfectly. Prepare to be annoyed by the bourgeois Clare, she does not seem to be into anything besides Henry and her family drama...and I won't even comment on the drool that fell on my book during the passages about her mysterious (read = esoteric & boring)""art."" Don't know why so many are down on the Gomez angle, I loved that part. Long but good book, worth the minor irritations."
5,Amazing first novel...,"This book is a well-written, incredibly interesting piece of literature. Those people looking for science-fiction will most likely be disappointed, but those looking for a good, thought-provoking and emotional read will find it quite amusing. It is very clever how in one story we get both the separate lives of these two people, as well as their romantic history (and future!)together, without it being told from beginning to end. It is fun to put the pieces of the puzzle together as events occur in the past and in the present. This novel is a love story, but also an examination of the idea of fate, and a play on the typical linear storyline. Definitely worth a read."
2,I am confused,I can not see how they made a movie out of this book. I should have read more reviews. Claire and Henry completely lost me on Henry's travels. The worst part was when there were two Henrys and two of his daughter. Also I had a hard time understanding why he had to leave his clothes every time. I was never sure when he died. Early in the book or when?
4,the strangest yet the most ENJOYABLE Love story i have ever read.........,i love the way the story is told from Clare as well as Henry's perspective........while Clare waits for HENRY........ Henry is not at all far from CLAIRE..........its such a strange book... i mean the time travel does take the novel to a different level....i mean claire is happy as a kid and falls in love with OLDER HENRY......but late after marriage she misses him while he's gone...(timetraveling).......but the sweet thing is he is somwhere back in time with Claire's younger self........i mean its such a wierd circumstance.............its SUPERB WRITING i tell you.............i really enjoyed this book very very much..............
2,Little Miss Contrarian,"I think I am the only person in the world who didn't like this book. I wish Niffenegger had written it as straight up scifi and skipped the loooong passages about going to the doctor, trying to cure it, explain it, etc. The writing was mediocre at best- Niffenegger indulges in the lazy chick-lit habit of using pop culture references to define her characters' personalities instead of um like what they do and say. Who cares what music they like? I found Clare and Henry to be narcissistic and unlikeable. I also thought Claire was a fool to spend the rest of her life the way she did. It was just good enough to keep me reading, mostly for the suspense, but overall I thought it was pretty awful."
1,Crude rubbish.,"A great premise gone wrong! A guy has ""fits"" that cause him to suddenly leap in time, dropping him naked and helpless into awkward situations...this should have been a very good book. Unfortunately, Niffenegger simply isn't a good enough writer to pull it off. Too many crude details give it a pulp fiction tone, and the uneven pacing and rough prose are equally offputting. The characters not worth caring about. Too many details are left unexplained. I hated it. Oddly, my husband picked it up and loved it. Found it to be a touching love story. Go figure (the man likes Bruce Willis movies, too).If you want a time travel story, go read Connie Willis -- particularly To Say Nothing of the Dog. Now there is a woman who can write!"
3,Not a bad book at all,"This is a good book. I don't think it's overrated at all. It's clear why it was so popular: interesting storyline, good narrative, well-written. Yes, there are some sappy, tear-jerk moments that undoubtedly contributed to global heartwarming but this doesn't detract from the book."
4,A unique story of complicated relationships,"I was fooled by the title of this book into thinking it was science-fiction (I'm not a big sci-fi fan myself).The book really is about the profound and bizarre effects that a main character's involuntary time travel has on his relationships, including that with his wife.I found the story quite intriguing and unique, and I definitely recommend it, however I found the ending really abrupt. The book was getting long, but I found myself really feeling that the ending left some things unresolved."
4,Sad ending.,I liked the book and thought the author did a great job of switching back and forth from one person to the other to give different accounts. I didn't like the sad ending.
5,Unique,"I've never read anything like it, fearing to finish it, but persisted to the end, luminously grieving for my 2nd-wife Carolin Combs (who died at 49 on 26 JAN 07.)"
4,Mesmerizing...,"At times a bit hard to read for me - especially when Clare was a young child and Henry was a young man - i just didn't like that, sorry. Appart from that, this was the LOVE story of all times/books, almost to the point of being obssessive and hunting, altough very powerfull. It's a complex story when it comes to the time travel, sometimes i had to wrap my head around the whole ""concept"" of how Henry meets his own younger self, i have to admit i still don't quite get it, i also would have liked to know what happens in between the years ""after"" Henry and ""before"" he meets Clare again when she is old, i guess i just have to fill in the gap with my own imagination and speculation. Read it if you are looking for something really original."
4,It kept my attention,"I received this book as a gift and was looking forward to reading. It was a quick read - I read it on a road trip. I agree with some of the reviews that the characters could have been more rich, but I have to admit, the book did keep my attention and I was compelled to finish it. I think if the author focuses more on fleshing out her characters, the next one will be even better. She obviously has no problem with an elaborate/complex storyline (meaning how she juggled the times/ages and still made it understandable). Look folks, I don't want to have to be a rocket scientist to understand a book. It's fiction, and marketed as such. Those looking for the actual secret/mechanics behind time travel should look elsewhere."
4,Hard to follow but worth it,"This is a fantastic read, albeit hard to follow. You jump all over the place in time and often find yourself confused as to what time you are in, but overall this is a very good read."
2,Slightly amusing,"The idea original. The end unexpected. But eventually I was just fed up with it. I guess is a good airport, beach, distracting reading."
3,The Time Traveler's Wife,"This book was interesting for its different approach and subject matter, but I found it difficult to follow. Once I caught onto the idea, I was nearly finished. If you prefer simple chronologically written books, this one is not for you. It does a tremendous amount of jumping around; thus the time traveling title. It was a good love story with some issues pertaining to the value of life that I found to be a nice addition. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but I wouldn't call it a waste of time either. All in all, it was a mediocre read for me."
5,Engrossing,"This book covers practically the entire lives of its main characters, Henry and Clare. Henry suffers from ""Chrono-Displacement Disorder"", so from the age of five on, he jumps randomly back and forth in time. His jumps seem to center around a few locations or catastrophic emotional events. In a large number of jumps, he ends up in the meadow outside of Clare Abshire's house. So, Clare knows and loves an older Henry, whom she has known since she was six. But in Henry's timeline, he does not meet Clare until she is twenty. Confused? Sometimes it is, but also very compelling and hard to put down. If my husband had not forced me to go to bed, I would have read this in one sitting."
2,Overrated,"(PLOT SPOILER ALERT) Really surprised that this book was such a best seller. The writing is fine, but hardly spectacular, and the characters are pretty superficial with the same scene repeating over and over. The plot doesn't go anywhere, and even the time travel gets boring. It gets absurd when Henry's young daughter starts time traveling, and honestly I felt this aspect was the most incongruous. Clare INSISTS that she wants henry's baby even though she knows the kinds of danger, risk and misery she'd be exposing her to. Makes Clare a very unlikeable mother. Also, the real world aspects of how other people in society would take advantage of this (ridiculously explained) ""chromosomal trait"" is not even addressed. Henry keeps his time travel a well-guarded secret whereas his daughter tells her classmates and teacher, as if it's no big deal. I found this book to be a huge disappointment."
3,Love eternal,"Any book that hints at fantasy or mystery immediately grabs my attention--The Time Traveler's Wife was no exception. The ""chronology"" of the storyline mimics the chronology of memory, skipping about from moment to moment. Once the reader gains his bearings (Niffenegger makes this fairly painless), he can enjoy a revealing ride through time and tale. The storyline keeps the reader interested, but beware: it does beat the idea of ""love"" through your brain cells continually, regardless of the date."
5,One of my favorites.,"This is the type of book that makes images of cold windy days, the color of fall leaves, and big cups of coffee pop into your brain.It's just beautiful. It's hard to put into words how lovely it truly is.I actually couldn't really process it once I finished, and I know that opinions are very different in regards to this book. One of my friends even told me not to waste my time with it. Still, I think it was completely gorgeous, lush, breathtaking, and...just wonderful. I know I'm going on and on but it's that type of book that just hits you in the face and makes you feel like running out and finding a man/woman to experience a life changing romance with."
4,Beautiful Love Story,This was a wonderful book. It was a page turner throughout the entire book. I enjoyed the characters and the plot all the way through. I highly recommend this novel.
4,Amazing,"Amazing. I haven't read such an amazing book since ""The shadow of the wind"" and ""Kite runner"". ""The time traveler's wife"" tells of the amazing life of Henry, who is compelled to jump back and forth through time without being able to control it! This is the result of a abnormal dna. He finds himself in the past or in the future without clothes and very hungry. In one of this journeys, when he's about forty he meets Clare, a six-year-old girl who will became his wife in the future. He meets her quite often and accompany her through her eighteen years. It is anything but fun though this jumping back and forth through time. Henry seeks normality, a wife and children. But Clare keeps on losing their children in a strange way. But it is not only a love story. It is about struggling to survive and also a struggle for his doctor to find a ""cure"" to give him a normal dna and a normal life. I felt compelled to read it, it was so interesting. A kind of modern fairy tale with a touch of sadness."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I don't own this, but borrowed it from the library. It's a good read, but is a bit long if you don't read quite as voraciously as I do. I really enjoyed this book, even though I thought I wouldn't. I love the premise of it and the idea that the time travel is a gene problem. I think the main characters could be fleshed out more as far as depth, but either way, Henry is not very likable through much of the book, but it fits with the story, as far as it goes. This was a story that I read to the end quickly, to see what happens, and it's touching at times, and too shallow at others. I haven't seen the movie made from this, and I'm not sure I will (I usually do one or the other, but not both because of all the differences). I'm not sure this is a ""buy it"" sort of book, as to me those are the ones you want to read over and over again. This was not that for me, but it was a great one-time read, and I recommend it for that purpose."
1,Couldn't hold my interest,I love time travel but this book couldn't keep me interested. The only reason I finished was to say that I had-I don't like not finishing a book once I started. But it was a labor to get to the end. Didn't care for the writing. The time travel didn't seem consistent or make a lot of sense to me. I think this book is more for the romance reader than the time travel reader.
4,Both Sides of the coing,"Well, I just finished reading The Time Travelers Wife. I am an AVID fan of ""read the book, then watch the movie"". The book took me for several unanticipated turns. I loved the way it was written, from both perspectives. However, I did feel like the ending left me wanting just a little more closure. But, in some ways, it seems like it is an never ending cycle for everyone except maybe Clare. I think you should read it, and find out for yourself all the twist and turns. Be ready to laugh, groan, cry and rejoice. Great book. Perfect for a spring break or week read."
4,a creative and fun love story,"I really liked this novel. I tend to be a sucker for a good time travel novel, which drew me to this. But it was more the ""love story"" aspect of the novel that made it so good. Who would have thought that two people's lives could intersect so interestingly when they are each different ages throughout, yet it really worked for me. I found it a really fun page turner. It you want a good love story (though a bit sappy) with some fun and unusual twists, this is the story for you. While this felt more like a ""chick book,"" I'm a guy and really enjoyed it."
4,"gripping, but with reservations","While the time traveling opened up much in the way of plot possibilities and much of the writing was solid, there were some recurrent irritants: (1) characters would have dreams that were too-perfect recastings of a day's events and feelings, with all symbolism falling neatly into place; and (2) the author seemed overly committed to mentioning favorite Chicago sites, stores, events in print...beyond what was needed for plot. I suppose many authors have done their versions of (2), but in this novel I thought it overdone or overly self-conscious or something. Still, I would not have put this book down, and even my sieve-like memory will remember many well-rendered scenes and images from this book."
5,Loved it!,"This is one of the best books I've read in awhile. It was well written and very compelling. Another reviewer found the time travel confusing, but I did not. Every section tells the date and age of the main characters so it was relatively easy to keep track of them. I've heard it described as a love story and it is. But it's so much more. Very, very clever!"
5,An engaging and original story,"This is a fabulous book- kudos to the author. The story is engaging and original. I fell in love with all the characters with realistic imperfections, and believe the story is believable from an emotional perspective.Henry is a handsome and unwilling time traveling librarian, who falls in love with Clare- an artist that believes in the impossible. When Henry and Clare meet and fall in love, they embark on an incredible journey that defines both of their lives. Their love endures the ""test of time,"" and challenges common sense. Highly recommended. I can't wait to read Niffenegger's next book."
5,Powerful and memorable,"I had my doubts about the premise for this book. But I read all of it in three days and was so sad when it was over. The love story is so real and powerful, and tragically heartbreaking. I loved the writing and I loved the characters."
1,Gratuitous sex & foul language - A disappointer,"The book has an interesting premise, but it includes much foul language, especially referencing Clare and Henry's sexual relationship. The scene with Henry's 15 year old self and his older 15 year old self is completely unnecessary and puzzling. Further, there is a scene towards the end where Clare is together with Gomez that is very strange and gratuitous. The author attempts to ""spice"" things up with sexual descriptions that simply detract from the book. It makes it seem as if Clare and Henry's relationship is only based on sex. Disappointing..."
1,Don't waste your time,I'm only 1/3 through but this is one of the most boring books I've ever read. I'm forcing myself to read it only because of the money I spent to buy it.
1,Not worth it,I wasn't able to relate to the characters and found the flow very sporatic; I was also unhappy with the ending. I would not recommend this book.
1,The Time Travelers Wife,I ended up putting this book down a fourth of the way through because it kept flipping back in time with different chronological ages in a very nonsensical manner that did not hold my interest.
3,Language Alert,"This is a compelling read. I was disturbed by the language, particularly the repeated use of the ""F"" word. Be aware it is on almost every page, and this book is 500 pages long."
2,boring,so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though.
2,Why?,"It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a ""love makes the family"" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film."
1,"So many people, so little taste","Truthfully when this book initially came out I had little interest in the book because of the time traveling science fiction aspect. However after reading the countless good reviews about it I decided to purchase it and give it a try. Purchasing it was my first mistake. The second mistake was to continue reading it after the countless graphic sex scenes including the creepy sex scene with main character and his time traveling self. The language in this book is awful, the middle aged main character appears naked to a six-year-old girl (who eventually becomes his wife) more than once. He continues to visit her throughout her teenage years and there is this weird sexual tension between the two. I was able to get about 200 pages into this book before I literally threw it in the trash, which I have to say, was fitting. If I had wanted to read a trashy romance novel I could have easily picked one up at my local Albertson's checkout counter."
1,I threw this book away,"While I enjoyed the idea(s) behind this book, I certainly did not appreciate reading the poor and questionable language found on many of it's pages. This book was so offensive that I stopped reading it after the first 5 chapters and threw it away. I can not imagine anyone I respect liking this book. I would NEVER recommend it."
1,F-bombs galore,"I chose this book because I like to read a variety of books, fiction and nonfiction. I can tolerate a sprinkling of swear words, but have never found a place in movies or books that warrants the ""F"" word. Every time I came across it (40 + times), I was distracted from the book and disappointed in the author. In addition to that, I found it boring and way too long for the content. I always finish books, but put this one on the shelf with only 60 pages left to read. As hard as it is to do, I will most likely file it in the ""round file"" as I can't recommend it to anyone."
1,book never arrived Time Travelers Wife,"It sounded like a great book, but I never recieved the book. I am in New Orleans and mail service is not reliable at this time, so UPS or FEDEX is a better choice."
4,Unique and Entertaining,"While this novel is about a lot of different things, it is primarily a love story with a wicked twist. Henry meets Clare and falls in love, she is six, he is 36, and 14, somewhere. Henry, it seems has a problem. He bounces around in time willy-nilly with no control over where he goes. Clare grows up knowing Henry, and then meets him when she is 20 and he is 28-the catch is Henry doesn't know her. And so it goes.This is a clever, fast-paced, and very entertaining novel. While we are bounced around into different time frames the author has done a great job of organizing the novel so the reader has not trouble remembering where we are-even if Henry isn't always quite so sure. There's also some great foreshadowing. I would quibble with one overall plot element that was a bit distracting for me, but it's a bit of spoiler so I'll let it be.This book was a lot of fun to read."
2,A time travel to nowhere,"I did not like this book. I kept looking for an ending that would make sense of it all. However, it did not offer such a treat. I felt the book was dull, hard to follow and uneventful."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"This book was horrid. The story was mediocre, the writing was bad. Even the main characters are underdeveloped cliches; the supporting characters are worse. It's predictable. Niffenegger relies on quotes to relay what her writing apparently can't. The name-dropping that occurs throughout the book gets old fast, and it fails to paint the picture of Chicago which was presumably the intention, instead just getting cumbersome. Frankly it was misogynistic, which is depressing considering a woman wrote it. The fact that it's a love story doesn't save it from its gaping holes in logic, its bad and inconsistent diction, and its poor, poor character development. I think that a person could find much, much better cute love stories than this one to read if that's what someone's looking for (and everybody wants one occasionally). This one isn't worth it."
1,Vacuous Drivel,"This is the first time I have wished that ""0"" Stars was an option.I am sorry I urged myself to read almost 300 pages of this just over 500 page shallow, vacious, piece of empty drivel. The characters are cliches and barely two-dimensional.The story line is inane, boring and pointless. Glad to see there are others who agree, but really can't understand those that think so highly of this book. I feel this was progbably the worst book I ever read, and I am an avid reader."
2,Couldn't really say....,"I can't say really, whether the book is awesome or not, as I didn't finish reading it. I would appreciate a rating system, much like the movie industry uses, that would let me know BEFORE I purchase an item if it may contain matter that I find objectionable. That way, I'd save my money for something that I would actually end up enjoying.This book contained extremely strong language, and sexual situations through out the first few chapters, so I didn't read any further and couldn't tell you if it was great, or if it contained any other objectionable material."
1,For the literary challenged...,"This is a candy novel. I am sure teenage girls love this book but the lack of character depth and sophisticated plot truly makes this one big bore of a read. Hmm...can everyone think ""Harlequin""?. The time travel gimmick works well and is interesting for about 75 pages, then the book meanders. Henry is too boring to even be an anti-hero. The rest of the cast is a collection of ethnic stereotypes out of a tired TV series--Kimy's dialog is right out of Charlie Chan and Celia is like a hooker from any CSI show. Whew...the obsessed with sex naked man with the adolescent girl will draw in some readers but this embarassing element is even more absurd when you see this on screen in the new movie...one of the dogs of the year."
5,Once in a Lifetime!,"It is such a great pleasure to stumble upon a book that demands to not be put down. These days, unfortunately, that seems to be a very rare occurrence. After reading only the first page, I was immediately intrigued. And once I got the book home I was simply blown away. Ms. Niffenegger handled the significant elements of her novel--time travel and POV--with expert precision, creating a smooth, polished jewel of a story. In fact, The Time Traveler's Wife has found its place among the top two books on my list of favorites (currently a tie between it and Irving's The World According to Garp).I look forward to the next book from this incredibly talented writer!"
5,Love,"One can find love stories in the most unlikely places, Dragonlance has one of the best love stories I have ever read, the Golden General and The Governor, it is incredible.This book, The Time Traveler's Wife is one of the most romantic and beautiful novels I have read.I particularly enjoyed the ""real love"" concept, real day to day, every-day, full of problems, full of challenges, full of predicaments love.I just love this book, and I recommend you get it and I hope you enjoy it."
2,BORING and so hard to stay with,"I have to agree with the February 4th writer ""Not sure if I will finish"". I thought this book was really hard to get into...so unbelievable, and so fragmented. It jumps back and forth so much that after awhile you don't care about the characters...you just want it to end! It's interesting that so many people loved this book...guess that's what makes reading interesting...there is something for everyone."
4,An Interesting Premise....A Timeless Love Story,I'm not a fan of science fiction (or time travel) books but this is definetly an exception. Wrapped within the interesting premise of time travel is a wonderful love story. I am the mother of three small children and an avid reader....but those two things don't go hand in hand. It's hard to get through an average size book let alone a book that is 518 pages long. I read this book in less than a week....so if that fact alone doesn't speak volumes as to how great this book is I don't know what would. My only criticism of this book is that the author sometimes goes a little bit too in depth about certain things. (Maybe that's why it's as long as it is). That is the only negative aspect of this book that I can think of. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!
2,"Eh. Okay, but really cheesy.","I think the concept of this book is really clever, and I enjoyed some of the scenes between the main characters, Henry and Claire. But the idea of LOVE! is so overblown and extreme, it brings the whole book crashing down into a pile of silliness. Henry's father is a completely debilitated alcoholic for 30+ years after his wife dies; Henry's ex-girlfriend commits suicide because she can't bear to live without him; and Henry and Claire think about nothing else in their lives, apparently, except the love and passion they feel for each other. I know it's a romance, but the all-or-nothing importance of LOVE! and lack of detail or consideration of anything else leaves me feeling manipulated as a reader. And by the end, I'm laughing, not crying, at Henry's overblown goodbye to LOVE!.Worth a read for the interesting narrative structure, but the LOVE! story is a pile of mushy cotton candy."
4,Where do I begin....,"This book was very diffrent then other books I've read. I got this book b/c of all the wonderful reviews that It's gotten. I just didnt find this book as wonderful as people is saying it is. I liked it dont get me wrong,it was a good book,expecially for a first time writer,but I just didnt find it AWESOME like I was led to believe.I also found it kinda confusing at times. That being said, I did enjoy Henry's and Claire's love over all those years. I could also see this as a movie. I definatly think it would make a spectacular movie,but the book just didnt suit me."
1,Too Long and Boring,"This is our book club's selection of the month, so I purchased the audio CD to listen to on a road trip. This book is too long (16 CDs and 17 hours of play time). Although the premise sounds interesting, the book is boring! The writing style is indulgent with overly detailed descriptions of surroundings; and information and scenes that add nothing to the story. Often my husband and I would look at the CD player and say in unison ""Who cares!!!"". Needless to say I will not recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Good, but about 200 pages too long","Pros of this book in my opinion: Very imaginative and original. Well written, even beautifully written at times.Cons - Too long. Writer went on and on on certain subjects and gave far more details than I wanted to know. By the end of the book I was skipping pages and wishing for the end. If it'd been shorter I would have finished and been longing for more."
3,Bummer,"I have a love-hate relationship with this book. The time travel aspect was superb and the writing was, in parts, absolutely delicious.One problem was that the author often got in the way of the story. Her knowledge of punk rock, papier mache, and art were in the book, not to serve the story, but to impress the reader. These though, were just secondary annoyances -- as were the page after page of dreams.The biggest problem with the book was the darkness and gloom. After reading the book I felt I had been abused. When something bad happened, it would be in the most violent and unbelievable way possible. The sex itself was not offensive, one just wondered why it would suddenly appear, like the violence, in strange and unfortunate places.""Time and Again"" is one of my favorite books. I thought I had found another enjoyable non-sci-fi time travel book and ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" started out with such class. I am sorry that I cannot recommend it."
5,an excelent book,i must admit i had set out not to like this book. But by the 2nd chapter i was hooked.It is an incredable love story. You feel all the emotions taht they do.Really a wonderful story
3,Bittersweet Romance,"Sometimes I love books that make me cry. Other times I feel badly used by books that make me cry. I think this is more the later than the former, although I did enjoy the adventure. It does make you reflect on what things are important in life, and dream about what you would do if you could travel forward and back and observe yourself as you grapple with big events in your life. Nevertheless, I felt the book was manipulating me. I wanted it to deal with profound issues in addition to issues of the heart, but it never really dealt with genetic engineeering or the potential changes to the time-space continuuum if someone changes even something as small as a signature on a drawing. It mentions these topics, but does not offer any speculation or provide any challenge to the conventional moral imperative. I wish there were more to this book."
5,Wonderful,This is one of those novels that you cannot bear to put down. It was touching and interesting all at the same time. Lovely.
3,Very Disappointed,"This will be short and sweet ... I was very disappointed after reading The Time Traveler's Wife. I purchased the book over the summer to read while on vacation in preparation for the movie. I must admit it did have me going up until half way through ... I love the concept and felt like the idea really had potential. I love the idea of time travel since reading The Outlander series. But, the language turned me off and I never really felt connected to the characters ... I did not see any redeeming qualities in them. Then, the ending was HORRIBLE ... I won't spoil it for those of you who have not read it. But, needless to say, I will not recommend this book to anyone! I still have hope for the movie ... I love Rachel McAdmas!"
4,"Wonderful concept and characters, but....","While I love the theme and the plot - which manages to be coherent despite all the back-and-forth storytelling, I just keep hitting the brick wall. There is some crude language, which is certainly not necessary to the plot. There are some graphic scenes that don't further the story and seem to be salacious just for the sake of being able to be. These are two main reasons why this book isn't a 5 star-rating. Having said that, the story itself is haunting and mesmerizing and will leave you thinking about it long after the book has been closed. That, in itself, is a reason to delve into this book."
4,Better than Chocolate..,"on a long afternoon. Well. For those of you who loved it, I second that emotion. For those of you who wrote the most critical of reviews: I challenge you to do better! I seldom get so caught up in a book as this one; in fact, I liked it so much I've ordered the audio CD ... unheard of for me! While I agree that several conundrums emerge during the course of the telling that don't really explain themselves well, this doesn't necessarily make the novel inconsistent within itself. And who can really ""explain"" the space-time continuum, anyway. The Time Traveler's Wife is a complicated read on several levels and though sometimes difficult keeping up with who is where and when, this book was truly a treasure of a find and one of my favorite reads ever (losing only one star for gratuitous profanity).I am considering writing Audrey a fan letter."
3,"Slow start, heck of a finish","Usually I don't take chances with what I read.. I just stick to subjects I know I like. So when I read a review on this book, I decided to take a leap and grab it.The book is 500+ pages and starts out slow (at least I think so). I mean, 200-something pages in I was wondering how much longer the boredom could possibly be drawn out before something interesting happened.As I got closer to the end, details came together and I was compelled to read more and more, right up until the last page. I won't spoil the ending but I can honestly say that I have never cried so hard when reading a book. Very moving and powerfully written, to say the least.Without giving away TOO much detail, I can say that it was a painful book to read - owing to constant tragedy - and it doesn't leave you with warm fuzzies. So.. don't read unless you're a glutton for punishment!"
2,Good enough but...,"**SOME SPOILERS**This book did not fulfill my expectations, especially with all the critical acclaim it has received. I don't feel the love between Henry and Clare and I got a bit tired of how the author felt the need to describe every minority in the book with stereotypes. I also didn't like the sexual encounter of 18 year Clare with a much older Henry. I was hoping she would also shed more light on Henry's phenomenon. I am well aware that I am in the minority given all the wonderful reviews people have given this book, but I would truly be lying if I said it was a pleasure reading it."
1,Couldn't Wait Until this Book was over,"It's hard to believe so many people liked this book. I just don't understand why. The plot never took off in my opinion. I was extremely bored throughout. I took this on vacation and luckily had the time to get it read during the vacation, otherwise I simply would've put it aside.I wanted to read it because it was recommended on the Today Show & my sister had liked it as well.Too many loose ends in my opinion ~ the relationship between Clair and Gomez ~ where did that fit in?Henry waking up all bloody & beat up ~ what was that all about?I got bored with the same scenerios surrounding so many miscarriages.Confused with how he died ~ without his feet after the New Years Eve party or found in the meadow, shot by someone he knew?The daughter's time traveling experiences ~ wierd.In summary, I just couldn't recommend this book and was relieved when it was finally over."
2,slow read,"Although this book was interesting at times, overall I don't recommend it. The format - jumping back and forth between points of view - was dull and slowed down the pace of the book. I forced myself to finish it finally just so I could move on to a new book and enjoy reading again."
2,Ugh!,"This book was so creepy I had to stop reading halfway through. An older man travels back in time to manipulate a young girl and mold her into his future wife, bleh!! Talk about your creepy pedo vibes. He is sociopathic and cares nothing if his actions (stealing for instance) hurt other people, as long as he gets his bride. Then he gets her and it's all sex sex sex pop culture hipster references and more sex. This made me roll my eyes.I give the book a couple stars for the interesting side characters only."
3,Ups and Downs,"I love sci-fi and I would like to add a couple of cautionary tips. First, do not throw the book in the garbage after you read the first few pages. It is difficult to follow at first, and at times - not very well written. Second, there is way too much sex in this book (and unrealistic sex, at that). The sheer volume of sex alone made me want to chuck the book. I feel the author should tone it down in future books. Anyway, if you can get through all of that the book is pretty good. I wouldn't say that the book is great, just that it holds your interest. The whole concept of time-traveling being something you're born with and have virtually no control over is a bit far-fetched. Furthermore, the author spends too much time on details that are not integral to the plot."
3,Enjoyed the Time Travel,"I enjoyed this book, however it is not an all time great. I was put off by the constant use of the F word and the long passages describing the couple's sex life. At times felt if I was reading a cheap romance novel, which is not my thing. However, the time travel aspect was interesting to read and I wish the author would of put more depth into the time travels."
4,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Well it has only been in the past year that I have found reading....AGAIN. It started with The Da Vinci Code and every book Dan Brown wrote, several other books in between and then this book. It was fantastic! I was a little leary only because I read Love Story comments and I really don't want to read ""Chick-Flick"" books, even though I am a woman (who is sometimes very emotional...I cry at some commercials), but that it neither here nor there. For me, the science Fiction aspect and AWESOME character development of the this book were wonderful. Very intriguing. The involuntary time-traveling aspect created some very incredible situations......even after I finished the book....I kept thinking about what was going to happen next. I Keep thinking this can't be all. I want more! I had a hard time putting this book down. I highly recommend this book, ENJOY!"
2,What's the Point?,"I enjoy the style of writing. I enjoyed the time travel aspect. Other than these two things, I just don't get it. Two not-so-special personalities 'fall in love', have a kid, and the ending just seems as though it is slapped on for the sake of a deadline, perhaps. The problem is, it seems to go nowhere. There was no development of the concept of changing things when you go back in time or perhaps, the essential being, consistant throughout time transcending time eventually. It seemed to just leave you dead, which is what happened to the characters eventually. Perhaps I am just too much of a romantic, but I do like a neatly tied up ending, esp in this type of novel."
2,Too Raunchy...,"I really wanted to like this book. I wanted to read it when I saw the previews for the movie because everyone knows the book is always better. The basic storyline was pretty interesting, but I just found the foul language and raunchy sex too vulgar for my particular taste. If you took all of that out of the book, it might actually be good. I think it takes away from the story and makes the characters less likeable."
2,"Great premise, uninteresting execution","The author flirts with some really interesting ideas, but doesn't know what to do with them once she engages them. So, unfortunately, this ends up being nothing more than a pretentious, trashy romance novel. Silly girl.Please, people. No more heartbreakingly beautiful heroines earing minimal makeup and coppery hair braided with seed pearls on their doomed wedding days. 'Mkay?"
2,"Smartly written, unique story, but not for me","I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion. While it was unique, it was too hard to get into. I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care. I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read. The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club. The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50. Some loved it, the rest of us hated it. There was no in-between. I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it."
1,THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE,"Pretentious, irritating, self-indulgent. Dull characters and total absence of 1970s/80s period atmosphere. By p.90 I was nearly shredding it to pieces in despair. I would rather eat my feet than have to finish it. It's a dreadful book."
3,WAIT UNTIL READER'S DIGEST CONDENSES IT,"These 500 pages seemed like 1,000. Are editors no longer employed by the publishing companies? She's one of several authors in recent months who seem to go to press without one word being deleted from their manuscripts. I would have red-penciled at least half her pages. Interesting premise, but entirely too unruly and disjointed for even the most patient of readers."
4,"Good, but I can't recommend...","I loved the plot of this book and I loved the characters. Yet I would not recommend it to a friend or family member due to the language. I was totally offended by the language in many parts. I kept thinking women don't talk like this. And they don't use THAT word! Overall, I did enjoy the book. But Ms. Niffenegger leave out the crude words in your next book. They are completely unnecessary!"
3,"Funky, creepy","Not what I expected. It was an interesting story line, but the relationship between Henry and Clare actually had me rather creeped out. I definitely wouldn't call it a 'love story', or 'romantic'."
2,Review of The Time Traveler's Wife,I was not very impressed with this read - I listened to all 12 audio CDs and was bemused to find that this version was blissfully abridged....Time travel never seemed so ... meaningless. Not a good time spent for those of us looking for a more existential meaning to life. Better to time travel to the next book on your list!!!
1,Hated It,"I suppose I would have found the story in this book mildly interesting (but not compelling) if the book wouldn't have contained so many graphic descriptions of the physical aspect of ""love."" I also was put off by all the profanity. ""Real"" people don't use that much profanity and I couldn't buy into the fact that these characters would.I didn't see hide nor hare or ""love"" between Henry and Clare and even if I had, it would have been destroyed by the scene on the kitchen table with Gomez.This book left an overwhelming ""bad taste"" in my mouth (and mind). The prose was okay, and that's what the one star is for. If I were you, I'd do myself a favor and skip it, though."
3,Confusing,"Parts of this book held my interest. The theme of the book as the title states, ""time traveler"" totally threw me into a state of confusion. Maybe I've lost my childhood imagination, but this book just left me at sea. Obviously, the author was going for originality, but I could have done without it in this case."
2,"Good idea, poor execution","This book's plot idea was good, but the execution left much to be desired. Each time trip is just like the last. The shift in point-of-view is well done, but the characters' voices are identical. The hero, a man, talks like a woman."
1,So disappointed!!!!,"I honestly thought this was going to be a good book since I heard the movie was good. It's such a slow read that by the time I got one-fourth of the way, I thought it was going to get better....but it never did. Sooooo many people gave this book so much credit and that's why I decided to read it. I put it on hold at my local library and got it three months after!!!! Now, I can honestly (to my disappointment) say 'what a waste of waiting.'"
1,Dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed to read this book. Not only was it not gripping, it was poorly constructed with weak character building, and too much disconnected detail. Perhaps if re-edited, it could be better."
3,Disappointed,"After seeing the movie trailer and reading all of the wonderful reviews of the book, I was very excited to read this book. I tried to love it, I really did but it was just so sad. I was in an awful mood the whole time I was reading it bc it just depressed me. I think that the basis of the story was good, but dragged on in places. I just felt sorry for every single person in the book. This might be the only case in history where the movie might actually be better than the book."
2,so disappointed,"I'm so glad that I borrowed this book from the library instead of purchasing it. I was hoping to read a really great love story - What a disappointment! The concept of this book is interesting, but the author's writing style was very annoying (totally agree with other reviewers who describe her writing as pretentious). I simply could not get myself to care about what happened to Clare or Henry. I kept wanting the story to end, but it just drags on and on. I can usually get through a good book in 2 or 3 days, but it took me 3 weeks to finish this one--and I forced myself. Very surprised that so many gave this book good reviews. I gave it 2 stars, simply because I've read worse. Based on my feelings about the book, I definitely won't be seeing the movie!"
5,mesmerizing,I could not put this book down. It was a truly beautiful story of love and life and death. I relished every moment.
3,Time Traveler's Wife,What a concept. Enjoyed the book very interesting but the jumbing from time to time so much was a little hard to keep up with
3,"Good read, could have been so much better.","Was one of those books you couldn't put down, but it let you wondering so many things. I agree with some of the other reviews that said that the characters could have been developed more. I also thought that the book left you hanging in so many places. With all that said, I could not put the book down, loved the romance in the story and the concept of the time travel, and can't wait to see the movie when it is on dvd. Read the book, but be prepared to be a bit disapointed."
5,Amazing Story,"I started this book against my will at the urging of a friend. THe beginning was very sci-fi like and I was ready to put it down, but as the story became clearer, I quickly grew addicted. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time - I've bought it as agift for two more people since reading it. LOVE it."
4,Stick with it,This book can be a bit confusing at the beginning but stick with it and you will want to read it again and again! This is an easy read. Great for a long weekend!
3,Helter...Skelter,"What a fascinating premise!I found it difficult to STAY related to the main characters. It seemed a helter skelter of comings and goings.There did not seem great depth to their personalities and for the most part, very one dimensional.Whenever I thought something was really going to grab me, it just fell short.Plodding through the book, I read it at bedtime as I knew it would be easy to close most evenings, turn off the light and sleep soundly."
1,Absolute bore,"For all the hype I finally broke down and read the book, although I suspected it's target demographic to be the stereotypical middle aged woman... disappointingly I was right. Time Traveler's Wife managed to take something so mysterious and intriguing as time travel and turn it into a mediocre bore. This book is less about the possibilities time travel presents and more about sentimental dreams, memories and the love between two incredibly average uninteresting people. If you want to read something good about time travel I suggest you stick to H.G. Wells."
2,"creative, kitchy, but no koo.....","after reading the Da Vinci Code, and Pillars of the Earth, I was ready for something altogether different.I was very disappointed in the content,and rather mudane flowof this book. Having each character (Claire and Henry) take turns in speaking what they are experiencing was a creative touch at first,but then it became an effort, no continuum of threading of the fabric of the story, whatever that was, and actually creepy to think that a young child would be enamoured by such a mysterious character who would disappear. Henry would remember the future or the past, but never knew why he would disappear, and appear in hostile situations when he time traveled. Save your money!!!"
1,Take it away,"I cannot believe the reviews this book got! I agree with the assessment above: this is a real stinker. Do not waste your time! The two main characters are so shallow and poorly drawn that you just can't care. The device of time travel and the idea of a genetic illness (called chronodisplacement)in the main time traveler character is clever, but is so clumsily applied that it just makes the reading a hassle, full of artificial cutesy stumbling blocks. I read a lot of literary fiction, and was in the mood for a good summer romance, but this wasn't it. I had to force myself to finish this. The ""prose"" is pedestrian and at times crude and ugly. If you would like an absorbing summer read, replete with a gripping plot line, romance and deeply drawn characters, return to the classics and try Anthony Trollope."
1,Boring and depressing,"I don't understand how anyone could enjoy this book. The main character is always depressed and pathetic. The ""action"" is the same old thing time after time (no pun intended) the only difference being that it happens to a younger or older version of the Traveler's self. I quickly found myself skimming through the book just to see how it ends and even the ending was a let down. The writer had a chance to redeem the book but ended it just short of the ""pay off"".I give it negative 10 stars. Awful, just awful."
2,Disappointing,"I was intrigued by the topic and reserved the book at the library. I waited weeks for it. Boasting a topic that was new and unique, it SHOULD have been really exciting reading. The first few chapters were interesting, but it soon became trite and boring. It wasn't that it was poorly written but frankly, I didn't like the cast of characters, their attitudes, etc. There was too much detail about unimportant activities, too much drinking. I'd pass on this one."
5,No marketing pushes necessary,"I've noticed that there are a lot of duplicate reviews here and obvious ""push"" reviews to inflate the books ranking. This isn't necessary! This book is FANTASTIC! It is so wonderful, fun, original, romantic, endearing and so much more that no fake reviews are needed. Honestly, this book is incredible. Read it if you are a hopeless romantic or if you like time travel adventures (but more if you're a romantic:) Fake reviews or duplicated reviews just make a book look bad (like it needs to be inflated!!). Please stop."
5,I miss them so much...,"I knew I was going to end up with a broken heart when the last few chapters were winding down. This book was so good that I hated not being part of their lives (the characters) and not knowing what they are up to at this exact moment. i wanted to call them, see what they were up to, be part of their-- out of the ordinary antics. they're fiction, but Audrey made me forget that."
2,Quite lacking at the end,"I initially liked the first part of this book- very clever storyline and fun for me to try figuring out the time line for both characters. After Henry and Clare are married though it went down hill fast for me. From that point on I found the story got more and more depressing with each page turn. Not a good kind of sadness (like the Notebook) either... like a dull ""why do I keep reading this- it's torture!"" kind of sadness. In my opinion there was no need for the tragic ending... it would have been a much better book all around had there been some hope and optimism in the end...happy endings work for a reason! I'm hoping for once they WILL stray from the actual storyline when it comes to making the movie!"
2,Is Ms. Niffenegger herself unstuck from time?,"I haven't read this book. But as I read about its plot, I just have to ask: hasn't anyone read Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut? It seems like this book is a total rip-off of his original idea: a man who becomes 'unstuck' from time and flips back and forth in his life. Honestly, it makes me sick to read this remarks like ""Wow, this is such an amazing new idea!"". Slaughterhouse 5 is a classic, and they even made a pretty good movie out of it, back in the day. C'mon, people, let's give credit where credit is due. Or, perhaps, Ms. Niffenegger is herself detached from time, and gave the idea to Mr. Vonnegut?"
1,I hated it!,"From the first page I found myself questioning whether I wanted to continue to read this book. I found the language awkward, the descriptions juvenile, and the premise so difficult to follow that I stopped frequently to question whether I was just having a bad day. After all...wasn't this a best seller? Selling numbers of books and creating something worthwhile to read are two different things. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Interesting concept but not well developed...,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I had heard such excellent praise for it. While I found the concept of the time travelling Henry fascinating, I thought the book really lacked in everything else. The characters were rather flat, not as well-developed as they could have been. Also, while I thought that in most places the author did a good job of keeping the story flowing, there were several times where the plot became extremely confusing and unable to follow.Finally, I thought the use of profanity and explicit descriptions of sexual encounters were entirely gratuitous in most portions of the book. It was quite jarring and further disrupted the flow of the story, which was not the easiest to follow to begin with. I gave the book two stars instead of one because I did enjoy the unique concept of the book....had the plot and characters been richer, I would have given it three stars."
1,DIRTY!,"You should know before purchasing this book how dirty it is. If you're fine with that then cool. The overall story line is good. But there is so much indepth explanation of sexual acts. If your like under 21 this book should come with a warning label on it because I had no idea what I was getting into. If your a mother who doesn't want your daughter to know the intricate details of a strangers sexual experience past and present then this might not be the best book to buy. I'm seventeen and was absolutely shocked. Most people say by the time your twelve you've heard it all but this was horrifically shocking. Most of the time teen girls read books they wouldn't be comfortable with their grandma knowing their reading. But I think this book would make my hooker friends blush. The F word also seems to be a favorite of this authors so if your offended by that kind of thing then do NOT buy the book. Though I must admit, if it wasn't morally degrading I would have loved it."
1,Boring,After reading the reviews I was looking forward to a good escapism read. I found it slow and boring. I stopped reading it halfway through with no interest how the story would end. The Outlander time traveler series is a much better alternative to reading The Time Traveler's Wife.
2,Interesting idea but who cares?,I read this book for my book club and only finished it because I was reading it for my bookclub. The author of this book put most of her effort into completing a complicated plot involving time travel. The problem was that there was almost no character development and consequently I had little interest in the story.
1,Won't read this,"I would love to be able to review this book but unfortunately will not be able to. This author refuses to publish this book in Kindle format and therefore I will not be reading this until it is. A friend offered to lend me this book for free and I told her, ""no, I like to be able to buy books on my Kindle and then I have them when I want to read them again."" When I found out it was not available on Kindle I had moved and was no longer able to borrow the book from the friend for free. I don't care for the library. I will not buy a book to clutter up my shelves again as I had books everywhere before Kindle. I would pay if the book was available on Kindle, but will only read a hard copy of the book if I am able to read it for free as I am tired of my whole house being cluttered with books. Thanks Audrey!!!"
1,Underwhelmed,"I read this book for a book club. If I read it for myself, I would have stopped at page 50 or so. BTW, no one could finish it in the book club...I was the only one who read the entire book."
3,Harlequin sex,"I'm not a prude by any stretch and I think Niffeneger is a fantastic write/storyteller, but much of the novel reads like soft porn for the lonely housewife.Three or four sex scenes might have been sweet but the detail seemed a bit gratiutious.Aside from that it was an alright novel though I disagree with it seeming anything but unbelieveable and too romantic. Henry and Clare are constantly going at it--true love isn't like that.Gilos"
3,Time Travelers Wife,"This book was a little too much. It kinda left me bored. I can see how some people love it, just not my kind of book."
4,Really enjoyed it!,"It's a wonderful, quick and easy read. Loved the realistic fantasy combined with romance.Definitely recommended!"
5,Absolutely amazing,"I picked up this book on whim from a must read list and was not disappointed. It is a story of patience and lost, of love on it's most enduring levels. It does jump around a lot, but everything comes full circle and blends harmoniously.It is the story of Clare and Henry. He meets her as a little girl and stays in her life while he jumps in time, all without a definate purpose or a way to change the outcomes. He is the ultimate voyeur, one that he would trade anything to change. The books unravels to show the ultimate commitment and sacrifice of their love, which truly is a beautiful thing."
3,Intriguing but profane,"Obviously I'm used to the old classics and ""nice"" books. I bought this book on the recommendation of a fairly like-minded friend, and thought the plot looked good. I wasn't prepared for it to be smattered throughout with the ""f"" word, oral sex, and brief graphic violence. Also I thought the end was rather depressing. There was little about living life, and mostly about life being wrapped up in this one person. This would make a better movie than book in my opinion--and I very rarely choose movie over novel. I'm sure this book will be wildly popular, but if you're like me and enjoy a good read that makes you feel like a better person at the end vs. feeling brought down a moral notch or two, choose another book."
5,Possibly my most favorite book of all time,"It has been many years since I read The Time Traveler's Wife for the first time, but I still call it my favorite book."
5,SO much better than the movie!,"I watched the movie before I read this book and I have to say that while I know most books are better than the movies, this one was SO MUCH more so.I like that this book isn't your typical love story, I like that it doesn't have your typical ending (I'm a fan of more realistic endings), I like that it touches on hardships that not a lot of books touch on yet a lot of women or couples can relate to.I noticed that this was one of those love it or hate it type novels and honestly, I loved it."
2,Not one of my favourite books,"This is just a short comment to say that yes, it IS a well written book, I could appreciate that, but still, it just didn't live up to my expectations and I fail to understand the hype around it. Just a matter of personal taste I suppose, sometimes that's the way it goes..."
4,Very clever story,"I got this book as an audio book for my ipod, and listened to it during my my daily commute to and from work. I honestly thought it was great. It was the kind of story you can get lost in. The subject matter is interesting, and despite what a lot of the people here who didn't like the book think, I found the character development to be very engaging. I disagree completely with people who didn't like the end of the book. I felt that it was completely appropriate. Some people just want an expected, ""happy"" ending I suppose. If they're going to judge this book based on one aspect, that is their right...but I recommend it completely."
5,"Unusual Circumstances, Ordinary People","The reason I loved this book is the same reason I loved ""Shaun of the Dead"" -- the characters acted like I believe I would, given the same situations.A couple of my co-workers read it and were unable to untwist the weaving plot lines, but I'm such a fan of this kind of fiction that it wasn't difficult for me. I sent my copy to my mother; I've decided to purchase another one so I can read it again."
2,Boring!,"After reading many good reviews about this book I'm surprised it's so incredibly boring, it really had a good premise but the author just didn't know how to explore it. The characters are so shallow it's impossible to believe in any of them, there are very detailed countless scenes about their daily lives yet all this adds nothing to them, because the whole thing always seems hollow somehow, since the very first page we're told about this incredible romance that never really happens. One day they meet, have sex and that's it, they have nothing in common besides their taste in music or literature. I'm glad I didn't buy this and can only imagine people who liked it so much never read many good books and are comparing it to something like Da Vinci Code."
1,Too slow.,This book was too slow an boring right from the beginning I just couldn't get into it and it went on my bookshelf probably never to be picked up again. I've seen the movie so I shouldn't have even bothered.
1,Possibly the worst book I've read....,"I have been a reader all my life and was loaned this book by a co-worker. Thank goodness I didn't purchase it. It was simply one of the worst books I have ever read, and I only finished it because she said the end was ""amazing.""The plot, while an interesting idea, was contrived and fragmented (even for a ""time traveller""). Subplots were non-existent unless you want to consider Henry's escapades gathering clothes and picking locks something of a storyline.The writing meandered through the most mundane and boring details chapter after chapter. I found myself one-third of the way through the book skimming pages just to find some substance. The main characters, Clare and Henry, are reasonably developed; however, the rest of the characters are so non-descript, I could hardly remember who was who.The end was as predictable and similarly shallow as the entire book. What a waste of time......"
1,could not finish,Don't know what all the hype is about this book. I found it to be very confusing. refused to waste valuable time reading it.
4,e in the midwest,I enjoyed this book considerably- it made me cry at the end. Definately a recomended read.
5,Good read,"I loved the story. I actually read a library copy and decided that I had to have one in my own library. Surprising, bittersweet, and wry -- these are the words that come to mind when I think of the story. All that and a little science fiction (time travel) thrown in."
1,"boring, shallow","I am amazed that so many people liked this boring, clunky, and adolescent tale. The time travel device fails on many levels, and it is never clear what telling the story in this way adds. The characters do not develop as believable people; they don't grow in psychological depth. The detailed descriptions of the routines of every day--do we need to know so much about every meal they eat or the clothes they put on?--are boring and easily skipped. As the characters never seem real, the end is not touching but predictable. I actually felt relieved that the book was finally over."
3,A powerful book,This book was very enjoyable. I purchased it because I like science fiction and was interested in the time travel aspects of the story. It turned out that this was not really the most interesting thing about the book.The time traveler aspect of the book is not particularly well done or convincing but what the book has to say about love and relationships is.
2,Odd man out,"I know that I am well outside the praise choir here. I know that the idea of this book is original, and I went into this reading experience expecting a quirky and brilliant ride. And perhaps this novel is both of those things, but sadly, its magic passed me over, and I found myself closing the book forever midway through. Something I have done only twice in my long reading life.The plot felt contrived and characters sharp edged. Here ""The Clever Idea"" was everthing to the detriment of the whole. I did find out how the book ended. I wasn't surprised, nor was I sorry that I put it down."
4,A very enjoyable read with one reservation.,"The author did an excellent job with this subject. Because of the time traveling by two of the characters, keeping the continuity flow in proper flow was obviously quite difficuly but was well handled by the author.I believe the book would have benifited from a brief explanation, at some appropriate point by Henry, as to the problem that would be created by trying to go back in time and bringing about a change in some traumatic event. Instead, there is only a weak statement that nothing that has happened can be changed.My only real dissapointment in the book was the unfortunate repetitive use cheap vulger language which had no real purpose and only raised a sence of disappointment in the reader."
4,Love story that endures through time,"I really enjoyed this book. The author really took a leap with the jumping around in time. At first I found it to be a little confusing and was concerned that I wouldn't be able to keep the forward and backward time jumps straight, but soon I found that it actually read very easily and was not at all difficult to follow. This isn't a sci-fi - this is a love story. Audrey took a leap in telling a story this way - and it worked. If you want to read a wonderful, touching love story with a fun twist in time - this is it."
2,Couldn't Hack It,"I was really looking forward to this book. When I finally got it and started reading I was disappointed. I kept waiting for it to pick up. Perhaps it does in the last 14 pages. I didn't get that far. I found it boring. I did not like either of the main characters (though I wanted to). They just didn't come alive for me. I forced myself to read the first 100 pages, hoping for something that would make me want to read on. Sadly, it just wasn't there."
5,Forever indebted to Niffenegger,"The first thing I noticed was the cover of The Time Traveler's Wife; it was very appealing. I found the book on sale, and although I had 4 different books on my shelf waiting to be picked up, I conveniently forgot about them. This is a beautiful, confusing (in a good way) and funny story about two lovers, Henry and Clare. Because it's written from two people's perspectives, it moves very quickly. I finished it in 5 days, and by the end, I was sobbing uncontrollably, wishing that it would never end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to fall in love again."
5,realistic and flat-out wonderful!,"A realistic look at what a relationship would be like, in which one is a time-traveller and the other one isn't... It's comedy & drama, but I wouldn't call it sci-fi or fantasy.This book is flat out wonderful.The temptation is to flip back and forth through the pages to see what happened in which ""when,"" but I quickly stopped doing that (1) because it just wasn't necessary, and (2) because the story didn't want to let me stop long enough to do that."
4,Good Read- but a little too long,Very enjoyable book to those of us who are time travel freaks. Very interesting style of writing. Book is too long and could have done away with the last 150 pages.
5,"Wonderful, supremely engaging time travel/love story","Please, please do not buy into the review titled ""people need to get lives."" This is an absolutely wonderful novel. I was engrossed from the first few pages. This is such an original take on the time travel theme and the love story is very touching. I will not summarize the plot line, as that has been covered by other reviewers, I will just urge you to read this book."
2,Sci-Fi meets Romance,"This book appeared more like a chronilogical narration of 2 lives that meet occasionally. The characters lacked character, didn't really have much of a foundation for relationship/marriage/children. The author may have been torn between what to write about the love story or the Sci-Fi, and did justice to neither."
3,Original but sometimes confusing,"This is a good book, but sometimes it reads more like a magic act than an actual book. Clare and Henry are the couple that the book follows. They are destined to be each other's great love, but they cannot always be together because Henry is jostled back and forth in time.Therefore, they meet up at different points in time. The difference in their ages does not even remain stable. Sometimes Henry is 45 and Clare is 28; other times Clare is 7 and Henry is 36; sometimes, though not often, Clare is older than Henry.In this way, the book is startling and original. Henry is briefly involved with another woman when he cannot be with Clare, but he does not love the other woman. She shows up eventually to exact her revenge.I admired the author's ability to execute this striking and original idea, but sometimes I wanted the story to linger in one time frame so it could focus more on the characters and less on the concept."
5,From a man who thought he didn't like time travel. . . . .,"Never! Time Travel? Silly nonsense! That has always been myposition, that is, until I ran into ""The Time Traveler's Wife"".My own thinking is that this is more of a science fiction novelthan a romance, but I can see the opposite argument. The relationship of the lead characters leads the reader to a literary acceptance of the weird propositon that a person can move in and out of time. How fun, one thinks, and yet that is the entire twist of missery, fear, and sadness. Now, my task is to convince my wife to read this, because it certainly will bea topic of conversation which should involved our own 36 yearrelationship. A couple can mature at different times, and switch values and beliefs- a sort of time warp. This novel represents one 20 best books in my life, and one of the best 5in Science Fiction."
4,A Writer's Read,"This work was written to be read by a writer. Reminiscent of William Faulkner in that non-linear fashion of writing; this novel jumps around... a lot! The story is overall interesting and meaningful. I agree that it is primarily a love story supported with strange ideals of the impact of time travel. However, I most highly suggest this to writers. Because, this work shows how to eloquently move amongst various speaker platforms with tremendous ease. Really, I found that in itself, thrilling, and worth the effort to drown myself in the work."
3,"It starts off with promise, but just wonders around...","I really liked this book when I first started reading it. It seemed interesting, and the story telling was very compelling. I certainly stayed up a couple of nights late reading it. Somewhere in the middle, though, you start to realize that the novel is just repeating itself. Oh look Henry disappeared again and popped up in Timbuktu naked. Sure, it's amusing at first, especially when he's meeting with his future wife, but then it just gets old and repetitive. I also did not find the ending satisfying. I would also have liked to see more exploration of the depth of the characters. Both Clare and Henry's family lives involve alcoholism -- I wish the author had explored that facet of their relationship."
5,My first review because I loved this book enough to write one.,"I recently became a full-time railroad commuter so I asked my friends, what books should I be reading? That's how I found about this amazing love story that hangs carefully in the balance of time. Other people have summed up the book in their reviews, I just want to let people know how much I enjoyed it, and to encourage others to read it because you will not be disappointed. I really hope that Rachel McAdams play's Claire in the movie, she would be a great choice."
5,Wonderful,"Reading best-selling novels is often a letdown, as I approach the book with such high expectations that disappointment is almost an inevitable result. For that reason it took me a long time to buy The Time Traveler's Wife, but now I wish I hadn't waited that long.Niffenegger has written a quirky, unusual story of a love that literally transcends time. The powerful link between Clare and Henry is evident and touching, and their romance that overcomes the strangest kind of difficulties is one that I will remember for a long time."
3,"Well written, but boring.","I felt like the entire book was a series of (largely) unrelated segments: each one ending with ""I wonder how Henry is going to get out of this one?"", and Claire sitting around wondering when he'll come back. Although he lands in different scenarios, they all started to feel the same after a while -- which I suppose is part of the point to understand his character -- but as a reader for over 500 pages it gets boring. Like I said: most events seem to exist on their own -- like what about the traumatic event with Claire as a teenager when they go to seek revenge? You basically never hear about this after the fact -- both unlikely and irresponsible to think this will never effect their lives again. Would have been good to get into the other characters more -- these two on their own just don't keep your interest."
1,Would not recommend,"I did not like this book. I have read books before where I didn't like the main character, but I found the two main characters unbearable. What kind of person sleeps with her best friend's husband and doesn't give it a second thought? A good writer would've given me something to like about these characters, some way that I could relate to them or understand their decisions. Nothing. I never felt that the characters were fully developed. It was an interesting idea, but the characters were way too flat and one-dimensional. It didn't seem realistic at all (and not even because of the time traveling aspect)."
1,One of the worst 5 books I've ever been given.....,"I know a lot of people love this book and it was given to me by someone who loved it. I might have agreed--all the way up to the end. The ending ruined the rest of the book, and left me shaken and angry. I really felt cheated. I don't want to synopsize the book, nor ruin it for someone else who might love it, but I felt as though the author didn't know what else to do, or ran up against deadlines...it was a cheap ending to a marvelous story. But that's just my opinion....."
1,Didn't get past 10 pages of this book!,"I hate when you start reading a book and it immediately starts talking about sex...there are a million OTHER things to write about! A waste of talent, I say!"
3,Interesting.....( 3 1/2 stars),"I found this book to be interesting, but not exactly consuming. I will say that I completed it quickly and easily, but I wasnt at all overly impressed by it. I thought it was sad. I wanted more from the ending. I suppose I wanted a sort of happily ever after that just wasnt possible...This was a somewhat big book and the idea of it is what kept me reading to the end..more so than the characters within. Would I recommend this? Im not sure... but I am glad that I was able to experience it."
5,The Time traveler's wife,A wonderful book told on CD. The narrators are awesome that keep you constantly engrossed in the story. It is well worth the time and the money. This book give new meaning to time travel.
4,"Cute story, interesting subject","I have to admit, I liked this one. I read some negative reviews, but I can't say I really agree with them. The story tackles an interesting subject and doesn't over complicate it- in fact, it was fairly simplistic. But it's a love story, not a sci-fi or commentary.I liked the characters and I don't think they lacked the depth that many others say- but they're not greatly complex, either.I read this story VERY fast- it was an easy read.Over all, it was a cute idea and not badly written. It was a love story with a little something different about it."
1,Did not enjoy this book,I did not enjoy this book and did not see any value it offered. I will not read any more books by this author.
2,"If you like the F word, you'll like this book","The story was interesting and fun to read, thinking about how a time traveler would have a relationship with a ""normal"" person, but I found the foul language irritating and the language used to describe love scenes to be crude and offensive."
2,Confusing and hard to follow,Normally I try to read a book I end up not liking at least half way through before I give up. I stopped reading about 25 pages into the novel. I just could not grasp the concept of this man's time travel. The author jumped around too much without much point to the story. I still do not understand why this man was time traveling and why his wife put up with it. She would even tell him about how she met him when she was six sand he was an adult.Then she would meet him after that at different ages. He would always end up being naked when he arrived after time traveling. If I saw a nude man when I was a young girl or an adult I would run and fast.The characters were flat and never developed enough for me to get interested in them or care what happened to them. It just was not beleivable.
1,Dirty enough not to read,"I'll be honest and say I didn't make it very far in this book. Let me just tell you up front that after the fourth dirty section I lost interest. The author should stick to story telling (...). Instead of writing about love making she gets caught up in the dirty details of explicit sex (...); and all this in the first 100 pages. If you want a wholesome feel good book, this is not for you."
1,Annoying,"This book annoyed me. There's simply no other way to put it. Henry is a time traveler, and he basically brings up his future wife when he travels back to the past, and then at some point, he dies.I couldn't have cared less.An insult to the time travel genre."
2,Not recommended for young readers,"This book was marveoulouly written, it contained great emotion and depth. However, it also contained a great deal of language, and situations I wouldn't want my child under 16 to deal with yet. Also my one grip with the story. What man would knowingly have a best friend who lusts after his wife?"
1,The Time Traveler's Wife,Do not waste your money buying this book. There is something inherently false about it. It pretends to be something that it isn't. This book disturbed me...it was hard to put my finger on it at first. It's a fake.
5,my new favorite book,"its a romance without being female porn, its a thriller without all the gore... this book had a little bit of everything; it made me laugh, tear up, and bite my nails- sometimes all at the same time. It was just over all entertaining and I'd recomend it to anyone interested in staying in on a rainy day just reading in bed."
4,Tragically beautiful,"This book was totally absorbing and emotional. After reading the final page, it took me a full 15 minutes to regain my composure. Nigenegger's novel affected me in the way of a powerful film. I enjoyed the visual trip around Chicago, and the doomed/blessed relationship of Clare and Henry. Remarkable for a first novel. I look forward to book #2."
4,extremely clever and original,"audrey niffenegger's record breaking debut novel is a clever piece of story writing, using a unique pretense the novel shifts its hero back and forth in time to meet the love of his life.the story is fabulously well paced and, albeit a trifle too long, audrey keeps the surprises coming all the time inthis roller-coaster ride. considering this is a sci-fi romance (for want of a better classification) the author invokes an amazing degree of believabiliy and induces dep empathy for hte plight of her characters.the story is warm and tender and is bound to be a big hit with lovers of intelligent romance novels."
3,TIME TRAVELERS WIFE,"It was not as captivating as I expected. As is often the case, the higher my expectations of a novel or film, the lower the results."
3,it was pretty good,I was really looking forward to reading his book. It wasnt what i expected but it was good.
5,One of the best books,Time Traveler's Wife is one of the best books I have read in years.I am going to start with how I felt when I finished the book and put it down. I wanted to call my firends. I wanted to call me female friends and talk about the loss and the living with loss in the book.This book would make a great book club book. There is so much to say when it is over. There is so much to express when it is over.Find a freind and read it together.The book itself is about connections. Make your own connections.Plese read this book
4,Trish Babb Lover of Books,"I loved this book...once I let my imagination run with the idea. The whole clare/henry relationship was fascinating, some of the most interesting aspects were the times betweeen Henry & Henry! This was a book club choice and it was one of those split decision books. If you are looking for something you can pick up and read and put down and come back to easily this is not a good choice, this book you must absorb and ponder and imagine. People who love good fiction but are not particurlary a fan of sci-fi will still enjoy this read."
3,"Great, till it got to the end.","Loved this book and was completely pulled in by the story. Until I got to the end. Geez, the author of this book sure knows how to kick a guy while he's down! There was no redemptive quality. Poor Clare waited for Henry her whole life... always waiting, always saying goodbye... The whole book I had hope that he would overcome the odds. Nope. Instead, he finally had everything he wanted and then everything was stripped from him.This book had LOADS of potential, but when out with a flop.Is it too much to ask for a happy ending?"
3,Time Traveler's Motion Sickness,"I'm still trying to figure out if, as Henry regressed in age and Clare matured from childhood, was their relationship illegal before and after their two gradients crossed? That's an ugly thought! Keeping track of their ages was too much work for this reader. Henry's flitting around in time was not easy to follow. I didn't ever learn to like Henry who was like a naked, queasy giant grasshopper. The author gave the event of time travel precedence over plot, characterization and romance. Maybe she'd better get back to the basics."
5,Floored,"It took me about two days to read this one, and I must say I am blown away. I have read many, many books-this is by far one of the best. I understand why a few people may not enjoy it; however, I believe that everyone should give it a try (most of you wont walk away disappointed). Five stars."
3,"Well done, just not for me","This was an odd book for me. I remember as I was reading it I really liked it. I even cried once (I won't spoil any surprises). A couple of days after I finished it, though, I did an about-face, deciding that no, I actually DIDN'T like it that much. Without the time-traveling factor, which I will admit was unusual and well done, the story was just not that noteworthy. It is the time-traveling factor overlaid on the story that makes the book something different. That being said, I decided that I didn't like the overlay. While it WAS well done, for me it was more of an annoying feature than a satisfying one. I didn't have a hard time jumping back and forth in time, or anything like that. It was more just that the time traveling aspect, in hindsight, was more like a series of spider-webs that I wanted to swat out of my path, but that kept just reappearing."
4,A nice romantic tale about true love and how time travels.,An interesting story idea that takes you from happy and excited to sad. But the array of emotions this book portray are worth it because this story is a good journey of fun and has a love that conquers all aspect. Would recommend this story for someone who likes love stories with a twist.
1,Why is there no Kindle Edition>>>> D:,Where is the Kindle Edition for this book? I've searched in the Kindle Dept and there is no trace of THe Time Traveller's Wife for Kindle!!!
5,Time Travelers wife,"I loved this book so much I read it TWICE.Really a great book.well worth the read.Saw the Movie,liked that too.The book explains the charcthers much better and at length."
4,What time is it?,You have to be willing to ignore the broken time element in the story and look to the characters. This is an interesting story with a fresh idea. I enjoyed this book very much.
3,Good story...too long.,"This book was inventive and different. However, my interest in the book began to slip halfway through. It was too long for me and there were parts that were useless to the story. She could've edited better and left a really good book.Read this, but beware of the length."
4,Stays with you long after you finish the book,"The Time Traveler's Wife was an unexpected gem of a book--a bittersweet story of true love that literally spans time. From start to finish, The Time Traveler's Wife was so incredibly moving and well-crafted, I couldn't put it down-- which was a shame, because I finished it too soon and truly did not want to put the book away."
5,"A beautiful, excellently-written love story","Wow. Forget the themes, motifs, symbolism, etc. What I love is a great story. This one just barely manages to avoid being too sweet, thus instead becoming a powerful, heart-wrenching love story. The characters came to life so strongly that, even though they all know how the story will end because it has been foreordained, I kept hoping desperately with them for a miracle. Again, wow. If this is Niffenegger's first book, I can't wait to read her second. Make sure you don't have to be at work early, in case you end up staying up all night to finish the book."
5,My Absolute Favorite Book,"This is my all-time favorites. I initially listen to it on unabridges audio then had to buy the paper book. Not much time for actual reading (paper) but my wife has read it and absolutely loved it. I've since listened to it again. The time travel aspect is a very interesting aspect of this story but one that's not easy to use. The author pulled it off, though. The story is of two people falling in love (not my typical read) and each page is filled with highly unique apsects. Somehow this story grabs you! I'm hoping there is a sequel... please let there be a sequel! Also - I highly recommend the audio version because of the dual narration (male/female) and how it brings the story more to life. WB"
4,Enjoyable!,"This is essentially a romance novel. I was expecting some fun insights or philosophical pondering about time travel, but the author seems to have used the time traveling element as a tool to explain the love affair between Henry and Clare rather than the other way around. This is a long book - over 500 pages, but it is easy to read. I hate to write this, but I think more women would enjoy this book than men!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!!","After reading the reviews and seeing movie clips I was very excited to read this book. I wish I could time travel back and never open this book. It is weird, depressing, scattered plot (not just the back and forth time travel)no character development, I could go on and on. I can't believe so many people like this book. There were so many holes in the story too, not sure what the point of the whole book was, a love story...too creepy for that. Mad at myself for following the hype on this one."
1,Too explicit and too much bad language,"The story is gripping and visceral, but I was made very uncomfortable by the explicit sex scenes (anatomically correct in every detail) and the multitude of f-words. I would not recommend reading this book if you are sensitive to those things."
2,disappointing & boring,"After looking forward to this book, I was very disappointed, I found it confusing at times with the age change every time the main character traveled, there wasn't an interesting story, only going back and forth in Chicago in a 40yr.time span, sometimes for only a few hours. I am afraid after reading Diana Gabaldon, Outlander novels,I have been spoiled,as her time travel novels are the best.I.M.J."
1,I may have been jinxed...,"After everyone I spoke to regarding this book absolutely extolling it for its wonderful qualities, I must say that I found this book quite lacking. It had such potential, and I was really expecting a good read, but as I got further into the story, my opinion of it subsequently decreased. I especially didn't like the end. You can check out my complete review here: [..]and read why exaclty I didn't like this book."
4,Interesting trip along the time/space continuum,"This is a really inventive novel that manages to create a new reality for one character while grounding the other characters (and the reader) in the world as we know it. While the ""rules"" of the new reality occasionally seem comvenient to the plot, the book still fascinates. Read and enjoy it. It's a great story of love, absence, and acceptance."
5,The Time Traveler's Wife,"I really enjoyed reading this book alot, and I hope it is one from which they will make a movie. Clare and Henry's love story is unique and timeless!Risingangel1961"
3,A love story,"To begin with this book annoyed me and I found the jumping back and forth in time and viewpoint confusing. I wondered how the author could write such a lengthy novel based on this concept. As the book continued I found myself drawn into the plot, the characters and their relationship. Audrey's characters are compelling and the plot interesting. She does the time travel thing very well- and the novel is comical, heartwrenching, warming and over all a beautiful love story. If it weren't for the fact that I like long novels - I would say it could have been shorter."
2,overrateed,"Although this book is receiving good reviews, I found it a disappointment. The plot,itself, is quite inventive. However, the format of narration is complicated and difficult to follow. The author does an excellent job developing the characters as the story progesses. However, the beginning of the story is confusing and difficult to grasp. Once you catch on to the author's style of writing, it is actually a good story. Not on the top of my list, but not on the bottom, either."
1,Too weird to even finish,"Selected through my book club. Could barely get to page 100. Too weird for me and difficult to follow. What was the author on when she wrote this? It didn't seem to be so much about the ultimate love as it was about voyeurism, obsession and a severe psychiatric disorder. No thanks."
1,Returned it to the library unfinished.,"Lost my interest around the middle. I kept reading in hopes it would get better and it never ""did it"" for me. Glad I did not pay for it."
4,Great sci-fi/love story novel!,"The Time Traveler's Wife is an interesting conglomeration of science fiction and romance. It is an easy read for such a hefty book. I personally enjoyed the realistic portrayal of both Clare and Henry. They are both lovely characters who love each other despite the test of time and unusual circumstances. Clare, with her everlasting patience, and Henry despite his brooding troubles, with his loyalty to his one and only.The time traveling portion of the novel is hard to follow at first, but comes together beautifully because the author is able to intricately weave together the threads that seem loose at first. This is a clever story and will move you ultimately, to tears. I enjoyed it because I was able to see Clare and Henry's love, their love that was timeless. I highly recommend this book!"
5,FANTASTIC,"This is one of the most unique stories I've read in years. Ms. Niffenegger's very concept of time travel in this novel is intelligent and captivating. The characters were well-developed and I actually found myself caring about them. Even though I thought that the end felt rushed and was slightly disappointed after such a compelling novel, I can still highly recommend this book and feel confident with my opinion that it is one of the best I've read - certainly one of my top ten."
4,difficult to get into....but....,"After you understood the flow of Ms Nifenegger's writing, it was almost addictive. However, in reading this book, I found it sad and more than a little disturbing. To me it had a sense of a purposeless life where people were travering time to find and keep that one final love in that life. With no real conclusion or closure. They just keep moving thru the same life. I think a story on finding loves in reincarned lives would be better. GM 2:11am 03-07-04"
4,A Wonderful love story!,"Really a great book- even though some people have ragged on this- I really enjoyed this book. Wouldn't it be great to meet up with yourself at different ages and times of your life....and maybe make things change. The story was very original and a real delight. I have reccommended this book to many people, and if you are looking for a book to cozy up with someone on a rainy day in front of fireplace- this would be it!"
2,two stars for effort,This is not an easy story to develop and pull off so I think the author deserves 2 stars for effort. I was anxious for the book to end and do not recommend it.
2,over-rated,"This book was an interesting concept, but little more than a trashy romance novel when it really came down to it. The idea of time travel was interesting, but the relationship between the two main characters dragged on and on. I kept reading the book just so I could be done with it."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"This novel was simply amazing. I have never read anything like it. It was powerful, compelling, and beautifully written, and it stays in my memory as one of the best books I've ever had the opportunity to read."
4,So glad I didn't miss this,"Out of the corner of my eye, in the bookstore, I caught the two magic words: Time Traveler. To me, that equals must-read. I find myself trying to find what theories the author uses to make the concept acceptable. I want to know how.(Turns out, our traveler here is ""chronologically challenged""...like a disease or mutation in his genetic code that he desperately wishes didn't exist.)I came away from this with SO much more than that concept. It's a tremendous romance, upheld with adventure and danger. Emotional without being what I call ""women's magazine sappy"", the intrigue remained and never seemed to wear thin.Don't forget the kleenex."
4,Romance/Adventure/Comedy,"I really loved this book because it was not only Romance, it was quite an adventure and some parts were funny. I couldn't put this book down. In the beginning it took me a minute to figure out what was going on but when I did, it was very interesting. I didn't really like the ending because I kept wondering what happened to their daughter and how Clare died. But I guess its not where you end up in life, It's how you get there. The Adventure, The Ride, The Story."
1,So Disappointed,"I picked this book up to read for my vacation. The movie version was coming out the same week. I started reading it, and for the first time... I had a hard time getting through a book. I found the characters difficult to like. I decided to continue reading and not give up on it. When I finished the book, I feld cheated by the time I wasted reading it. Many parts in the book were disturbing. I found myself wondering why people thought this was a romance. There is very little romantic love happening in this story. As I have admitted my loathing of this book to other women, I have been pleasantly surprised to find out that many others feel the same. However, this book is so revered by so many that people are afraid to bash it. I think if you want a romantic story, go elsewhere. I have no desire to even see this movie."
3,"Difficult to get into, overrated.","The first half or so of this book has no storyline. You are just stuck reading a seemingly endless stream of events that doesn't appear to be building towards anything. It took me a full week to get through the first half of this book, but I was able to devour the last half in one day. You are easily reeled into the relationship of Clare and Henry once they finally begin their life together. You realize that though their relationship is written about as if it is a fairytale, the characters are not so unreal. They have quirks and they argue just like typical couples. They are a joy to follow.What truly makes this book fall flat is how predictable it is in its final pages. We know how we would like the book to end, but the ending is already spelled out for us well before it comes to pass, so I felt let down by its obviousness.Many people praise this book as the best book they have ever read, to which I'd reply, ""you can't have read much, then."""
5,Loved it!,"I'm surprised that there are any negative reviews of this book. I loved it! Yes Henry and Clare are intelligent, artsy types who go around quoting foreign poets and philosophers but it's a fiction book, it's not based on real people. Never once did I find the dialogue forced, it flowed wonderfully. The reviewers who take issue with Henry reciting German poetry didn't take issue with him being a time traveler?Anyway, don't let the bad reviews keep you from reading this book. I loved it."
3,Bleh,"For anyone looking for some kind of substance in what you're reading, you won't find it in this novel. Yes, it is a page-turner and it keeps you engaged but it does not provoke you to think beyond the book. It is a book you can read on the train on your way to work. Like a previous reviewer said, the characters in this book ARE pretentious. It tries a little too hard to include the diversity that is America but fails because in a lot of ways, it is stereotypical.Plus, it's hard for me to understand how someone can wait their whole life. You have to live, if not for yourself, you have to live for the people in your life.It's not a terrible book, but it's not a classic. And some of the German in this boo is bad, too. Of course it's a best-seller, most best-sellers are crap. I was intrigued by the title.The book was a little sad, but at the same time, the ending left a lot to be desired."
1,Self-important Rubbish,"If I'm going to be manipulated by a novel, I at least prefer not to be aware of it. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is too content to show the reader the strings - one is always too aware of the effort that went behind it. The effort to make Henry ""cool"" - half the time, he just lists lyrics or bands that he listens to, or quotes obscure poetry. The effort to make witty repartee between all the main (read: to be liked) characters.And yet, no effort at all went into making the reader believe in the central relationship. We never see the two falling in love - we are just meant to take it for granted that they ARE in love. That's a dangerous thing to do with a romantic novel.I also strongly object to the way Clare narrates. I hate narrations that eschew punctuation like commas for really no reason at all."
1,Depressive-sadistic,"The book is incredibly depressive, culminating in a series of chapters that I can only describe as sadistic. A very good original idea of involuntary time-travel kept me reading until the end, because I'm a science finction fan, but it is rather a book about clinical depression, drugs, suicide, torture, and death. Oh, and references to drugs and painkillers look more like advertisement. The story line goes from bad to worse.I could not sleep well after finishing the book. Now I deeply regret that I read it. Horrible!"
3,"""Lacking in depth""","I wanted to read this book primarily because I want to see the movie and usually the book is much better than the movie. I personally find that the book lacks depth and am hoping that the movie will be better than the book. I enjoyed the book ""Water for Elephants"" much more than this book."
5,Just Finished it This Morning,"This book was a thrill to read. The many plot lines were captivating and the characters effervescent and charming. I cried like a baby. Such a great idea for a story and Niffenegger painted this beautifully. However, I think it would have best been left alone, and not made into a movie. Highly recommended."
3,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Niffenegger does an excellent job with the premise and the plot. The ""hiccups"" through time keep the reader captivated. While The Time Traveler's Wife was a beautiful love story, the use of profanity and vulgarity pull the reader's attention from the romance of the story to the base and animalistic nature of the characters. Overall, an interesting read. The book contains a fair amount of foreshadowing, allowing the reader to make a clear prediction of the tragedy that will take place. It's a science fiction romance that would capture any reader's attention."
2,What a BORE!,"After reading reviews and hearing people swear up and down that this was a good read I gave in. Unfortunately this book was so boring It took me two weeks to force myself to the end. The characters are bland and their romance is unconvincing, I wouldn't even call it a romance, honestly I found nothing romantic about these two. BORING!!! Plain and simple!"
2,An unsatisfying read,"I liked the premise of the book but the lack of character virve and the ""so, what happened?"" ending make this novel a definite El Passo! If you want satisfying, intelligent time travel (of sorts) read Robbins' JITTERBUG PERFUME instead. Now that's a 5 Star winner!"
2,A disappointment,"The author took an original and interesting idea and failed to execute it properly. It really drags on in several parts, which is surprising considering the abundance of story lines and the fact that the non-linear time line forcibly ads an element of mystery to your reading. I was not touched by the romantic storyline between the two main characters because it was so shoddily developed. I'd classify this book as Chick Lit for the reader who is in denial about liking Chick Lit. Skip it."
5,An Incredible Moving Read,"This was by far one of the best books I have read. And I highly recommend it to everyone. Though I do warn you that it is a tear-jerker. (Something other reviewers have failed to mention)Now I will clarify some misstakes that the reviewers have made about the story. First off, Clare first meets Henry when he timetravels to her when she is just six years old and for the next twelve years, she only meets the time-traveling Henry. When she is 20 and he (in present time) is 28 they meet for his first time and go from there. It is a wonderful story about love and life but it isn't a Danielle Steel novel or anything. Trust me that it can appeal to many different people, men and women, young and old alike.It is very easy to follow and everything is well explained (even the time traveling) and in a very plausable manner.Please give this book a try. I know that if you read it through you will not regret it."
5,one of the best books I read last year,"This book held me in its grip - I finished it in 24 hours while on vacation. I kept hoping that the eventuality would not really happen, and read and read like I couldn't wait to find out when he would reappear in her life. WOW - have recommended to all of my friends."
2,"Weird, bizarre and frustrating","The idea of someone who travels between past and present is interesting, if not totally original and I give the author credit for tackling this kind of story. The problem I have, however, is that many of the scenes are just plain weird. Some examples - Henry's nakedness, two adolescent Henrys alone together, a forty-something Henry with eighteen-year-old Clare. And there are many more.Niffenegger clearly spent a lot of time coordinating the dates of Henry's appearances and she plants the hints of the story's end in appropriate places. But the jumping around is too frequent and varied and just plain awkward. To help the reader, Niffenegger supplies an unending supply of references of Chicago, music, stock market activity, pop culture, etc. I get the feeling she Googled every decade from 1960 to present and crammed in all the results.The story is a fast, casual read."
2,Could have been a charming love story,"This could have been a charming love story. Great potential. However, as it stands right now it does not offer a reader anything except an easy read on an airplane where you have plenty of time to kill and no place to go. I do not want to repeat what has already been said by other readers in terms of analysis. Highly recommend a review by Amal Jacobson."
4,Fascinating premise,"As with all books that deal with time travel, the premise is so rich with possibilities, that if done correctly, the result can be fascinating. This book was well written and very interesting, but not quite deserving of a fifth star. I'm glad I read it as it was very thought provoking. Reminded me somewhat of Nicholas Baker's Fermata, one of my all time favorites."
4,Romance + Sci Fi = WOW!,"Traveling back and forth in time as abruptly as Henry does is jarring but addictive once you get the rhythm. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" has such a universal appeal that I highly recommend it as a gift and that is a first for me."
4,Its great until the end,"This book is great and I couldn't put the first 3/4 down. Its the ending that isnt' as great. One character becomes what the other character doesn't want. I liked the heroine but the problem I have is that her life is a nasty circle. At first I thought it was these people destined to be together but now I'm not so sure. I think it might be her manipulated into believing they should be together. A self fulfilling prophecy which is only fulfilled because he can time travel. But then again maybe it was destiney. These are the dilemnas the book raises, all of which make it worth reading. So I recommend you do."
1,very boring,I was very disappointed in this book. It is filled with stereotypical suffering females while offering no resoultion to the wife's true agony of loving a man with flaws. The ends nowhere. I expect to see this on Lifetime telveion or a movie. There is no character development at all.
2,"I agree with the person who said ""boring""","I really wanted to like ""The Time Traveler's Wife"", but just couldn't get into it. I give the book 2 stars(as opposed to one)because the plot idea is different.It took me a while to get used to the time skipping and Henry being different ages. Also two Henrys in the same scene(especially the 15 year old Henrys......that made no sense what was implied they were doing together!) bothered me.I would have stuck with it, tried to go with the flow of the book, but it was not holding my interest. The conversations Henry was having with Clare were dull. zzzzzzzz The story did not seem to be going anywhere, so, sorry to say, it was put aside and I started reading something else."
1,Dull,The movie promos looked good so I decided to read the book first. I could not get through this. I got half way through and finally gave up. There is NO plot. Nothing happens. Characters come and go with no real purpose. I feel i wasted a week trying to plough through this.
2,Disappointed Reader,"This was a pleasant enough read, but certainly not serious literature and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was so repetitive and silly and, in the end, overly sentimental. I was really looking forward to getting into this book, or at least being entertained by a novel idea, but all I got was a very long Danielle Steele type piece of fiction. It's a shame because the author obviously had an interesting idea, but she had no plot ... and without plot, you've just got a really long dialogue.By the way, if you are choosing books for The Today Show, you should really start looking around for a new job. Your choice of literary material stinks. There HAS to be better work out there!"
2,"Drivel, Unfortunately","I finish books. I have read plenty of poorly written books simply because I feel like I have a moral obligation to the author not to give up on them too early. I have read just over 100 pages of The Time Traveler's Wife, and I just don't think that I can finish it. The characters are flat, the dialog is unrealistic, and the plot is confusing. A true pity. The idea of the plot is innovative and fascinating - I kept wishing that it was in the hands of a more talented writer."
1,Boring,"Pointless rubbish. Worse than Nicholas Sparks. Don't waste your time or money. Besides, not available as an eBook due to the small minded author."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This is a terrible book! Its about how life sucks, then it sucks worse, and then you die. I hated the insipid characters."
1,The Time Travelers Wife,Would never order from this person again I put my order in on the 19 Of October she did not send until the 1st of November Horrible customer service
2,nice try,Nothing new and exciting happened in this book. I couldn't get into it. I read 3/4 of the book just to give it a chance but i just couldn't finish it. it didnt keep my attention at all. total waste of time.
2,Lacking Emotional Depth,"I watched the movie first, and I loved it. I cried at the end. Most books are WAY better than the movie, so I picked up the book at the library and was prepared to feast on the story. I was hugely disappointed. The story lacks emotion. I couldn't feel for either character at all, because there is no emotion told at all. There was simply no depth to this book at all. It's merely a telling of events and that's about as exciting as it gets. In addition, the author uses terms to describe the sexual acts that are crude and vulgar and very clearly meant for shock value as none of the characters talks this way at ANY other time except when referencing sex. Sex between the characters is mostly only referenced, using the 'f' word. Again, crude and vulgar references.I'm very disappointed in this book. See the movie. It does this story better justice than the author of the book does."
1,Didn't finish it. Didn't care about not finishing it.,"I appear to be in a minority, but I thought this was awful.Basically, I didn't like any of the characters, but several other things prevented me from a) loving it, b) liking it or c) just finishing the damn thing. I hated the time-skipping device; it was like Doctor Who on speed and was confusing, ridiculous and a bit creepy (little girls, grown men, etc).Actually, I read it some time ago and can only remember the characters names were Clare and Harry (I think). I don't remember anything else happening. Considering I have a superb memory for detail, that just about sums up how memorable this novel was. I gave the book to a charity stall and felt bad about someone else picking it up in good faith. Still, at least Cancer Research is 99p better off."
2,"This poor, poor book","This poor, poor book is dying to be a movie. It's just struggling to exist as a novel on a bookshelf when it has been deformed by a few significant major-motion-picture-style characteristics. First, the text is littered with trivial detail. Second, there is an abundance of dialogue. (These two combined make some pages read like parts of a script, stage directions and lines.) Third, the graphic sex. Fourth, the lack of a single defining plot point. The premise of the book is extremely clever, diligently crafted abd explained and well-held, but the horrifically expository writing (think the first fifteen pages of any Baby Sitter's Club novel) distracts from the central ideas and questions the book should raise. Not to mention that Niffenegger's theme of comparing her two characters to Odysseus and Penelope is presumptuous and downright cocky!"
5,This is my idea of the perfect book.,"I loved reading this book and was so disappointed that I finished it so quickly. There are plenty of other reviews which tell you about the content of the book. I wanted to stress how this book spanned romance, science fiction, humor and history so well. Enjoy this book!"
2,Confusing and pretentious,"I finished it, so it gets 2 stars, not one. However, it's jumpy, hard to follow, and kind of boring at times. It doesn't take long for me to get pissed off at the constant whining of Clare. Poor, poor girl - born rich, live rich, basically farting around all day being ""artsy"" and naval gazing. Bleh. And why are all their friends their friends? What on earth do these people have in common??Henry is kind of interesting, in that he has to make his way through whatever situation he's in.The chapters about baby making were worrisome. Don't they get a little freaked out by the multiple miscarriages? Or the idea that fetuses might be time traveling outside the womb? FREAKY.By the end I was depressed and annoyed with everyone in the story except Alba, who is just a victim of everyone else's selfishness."
4,A haunted love story,This is a interesting read about time travel and real lasting love. The author developed the characters so well that you become haunted by them.I did find the some of the swearing and one sex scene (you will know it when you read it)not important to the storyline.
3,Henry does not exist except in Clare's mind.,"Nice read, overly long and redundant, terrible science (fiction). And through it all, I had the feeling that Henry did not exist, was a complex creation of Clare, resulting from her distance from her own parents and, ultimately, and in unscheduled ways, from Henry - which she says, she was not opposed to. He fulfilled her own needs..."
1,??????,"Could not finish the book. It was recommended by several people, but I didn't find the concept that interesting. The writing style never could capture my attention."
4,COMPELLING,great reading material found within this one. very engrossing.well worth the hardback price!quite good!( I am not a writer so my review wont do it justice. buy it. youll like it)
4,Inventive,Ms. Niffenegger is a very talented and inventive writer. I thoroughly enjoyed the journey and look forward to her futurebooks.
2,Slow,"I knew they had made this into a movie and so I was curious and decided to read the book. It was a little disappointing, very slow in my opinion. Other then the fact that he can time travel not a lot happens in the book. Overall, though it is a sweet story."
5,"Original, Emotional, Brilliant",This book is brilliant. I just am in awe at the storytelling of Niffenegger. Emotion is woven into the plot and I wasn't really aware of how emotional the work is until the story was nearing the climax and it blew me away with how tied I was to the characters. It is a mature book with incredible rewards
5,The most powerful and memorable book I've read in a long time.,"It's very rare to find a book written about such real characters yet that creates such a beautiful, powerful, and haunting love story. The way the author handles subjects like death, love, ex's, the loss of a child, and many more difficult subjects is amazingly masterful. It probably didn't help that my husband had just left on a long deployment for the Navy just before I read it, but this book made me bawl like a baby. You really truly care about the characters by the end of the book, and even though it breaks your heart again and again, it makes you indescribably happy about the beauty of life and love.My husband even loved this book, and he normally doesn't like love stories. I've never seen the movie, but I know this book is amazing."
4,Good Book,"Now at age 53, reading has become a new hobbie for me. My review is simple. I enjoyed the book, found it hard to put down. I heard that the book was much better than the movie, but I am anxious to see the movie anyway. Off to the video rental store...................."
4,Wait-the most beautiful form of love,"absolutely beautiful. Claire and Henry have no fear in time, while we normal people do. How effortless but strived they have been through life and waiting.I wonder what Alba's life would be."
3,"Great Idea, Could have been better","Although I will be the first to say that I personally could not have written better, I think that this book was a fantastic idea, poorly written. I find the constant narrative jumping of random time backwards, forwards and in between, to be very difficult to follow. I understand that time is the essence of this novel, but it is presented in such a confusing way that it is difficult to enjoy the story that is trying to be told.I was surprised, but not offended, at the profanity and sexual explicits. However, they gained excessive use by the third quarter or so of the book and were so over-used that they detracted from the points they were meant to cerate.This, along with the sequencing was just too much, and really destroyed a great idea. I don't like having to write a negative book review, but I just was so dissapointed in the disparity between what I hoped this story would be and what this book ultimately turned out to be."
2,The Time Traveler,"In short, the novel was 200 pages too long. It was full of repetitive scenes.By the end, I didn't care for either character. I just wanted to see the end of the novel. I wanted to be shown more of what happened to Henry in his time travels. We ""hear"" he has been beaten and even raped, but that remains for the imagination to solve since Niffenegger decides to omit those parts and castigates us with endless scenes of Henry showing up all over the place shivering and naked."
2,If you unravel it...,"If you took the events and played them out in linear time, it's a pretty dull story. Which means, the time traveling was just a gimmick. As such, it was entertaining once, but won't stick with you."
4,A Great and Believable Sci-Fi Love Story.,"I am not an avid reader by any means, but the premise of this book really caught my attention. The love between the main characters Clare and Henry was very well laid out throughout this novel. The happiness in finding one another, the acceptance of a guy who travels thorugh time uncontrollably, and the never ending tension that arises when Henry disappears for hours or days at a time.The only thing that kept 5 stars from being put on my review, is the overwhelming sadness throughout the book, that at times was making you think ""What could possibly go wrong NOW?"" I am all for a good drama, but at times the multitude of doom and gloom was a bit too much to bear. Good thing some humor was sprinkled throughout the book though to balance these macrabre occurances out.All in all, though, a great read!"
4,Very Touching,"This is a beautiful book----I just finished it five minutes ago and I am still teary-eyed! The plot is interesting, the character development is good---there were times that I felt it was not the ""greatest"" book but those moments were few and far between (and they mostly had to do with all the name dropping of punk bands...as if the author was trying to show off her musical expertise...it was distracting). BUT I was sucked in and could not put it down. A very nice love story--sprinkled with sci-fi and not too sappy! Great ending. Sniff."
5,This book has no peers!,"Those of us who have read this book are in a group unto ourselves - we are forever changed by the characters, the story, the possibilities of The Time Traveler's Wife. This is a story that will stay with me always - that I will revisit often. In a few decades, they will be calling this work of literary fiction a Classic. For sure, it is not to be missed by anyone who calls themselves an avid reader. When I turned the last page, I felt like I was mourning the loss of loved ones~"
4,If you liked the movie...,Saw the movie and wanted to read the book to get more in depth with the story. An easy read.
4,Well worth a look...,"I started reading this book and couldn't put it down. I am surprised how fluid the book actually turns out to be eventhough the book jumps to different times in the characters' lives. At first it is a little confusing to jump back and forth in time, but I got used to it. As I was reading, I would have a question about something that had just happened and later in the book, the questions were pretty much answered. I'm glad I read it!"
3,great for price,"i've enjoyed using this in my piano studio, but have noticed one main problem. the theory is actually fairly advanced - key signatures, eighth notes and rests, intervals up to a seventh (maybe more), BUT, the graphics and animation (though way better than the Music Ace stuff) is more childish. My students who can actually do most of theory would not be interested in the graphics."
5,Great Intro For Little Ones!,"This is a clever little program that will keep the attention of your young ones - I recommend for 2+ to 4 as an entertaining program, ages 5-7 as an educational ""introduction"" to music with challenges. Computer/mouse operation. The delight it brings is worth the price!"
3,"For the price, OK. But there's better stuff out there.","I bought this to use with my piano students on our studio computer. The games are fine and have educational value. But compared to some of the other software out there, this CD feels kind of like an afterthought. It's a great price, and it does have some value. But don't expect tons of bells and whistles."
2,Not What I Expected,"The manufacturer says this is for ""beginners of all ages"" but the case says ""ages 7 and up."" It is definitely not for total beginners. The games require that you already know how to read music to some extent. This would be good for kids who are already taking music lessons, but it isn't going to teach music to a kid who doesn't know it yet. In my case I will have to put this game aside for several years because my 4 year old son cannot play the game at this point."
4,Music Games Review,This product is a good tool for very young children to learn the piano keyboard and note names.
1,Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This CD sucks!!!!!!! This is the worst money I ever spent. The games are overly simple and very short with no replay value at all. This cd is a real rip-off!!!!!!
4,pretty good,The songs are not the original artists but are excellent reditions of the originals. We play it for the kids all the time at the preschool. This CD does not get five stars from me because the artists aren't listed anywhere on the CD. If I sang a song on it and they didn't list my name I'd be pissed off!
2,Not Original Singers,I was disappointed. Not original singers. Sounded alright I guess but nontheless disappointing. I gave it 2 stars because it was not Amazon's fault. I just didn't notice that it was not the originals and it was shipped to me fast as always. Thanks anyway.
3,Great and simple,This book is full of helpful ways and direct examples of how to gain better people skills!
3,"Good Story, Poorly Executed","This book picks up where ""A Rift In Time"" leaves off. The story is action packed, particularly towards the end. As others have said, there is a definite element of ""Indiana Jones"" in the book's protagonist Adam Livingstone. He seems to be on a never-ending adventure throughout Europe, Northern Africa and Southwest Asia. In many places, these adventures seem far-fetched. Livingstone is kidnapped at one point. He escapes from his captors in Croatia and makes his way back to England mostly on foot. Presumably several weeks elapse, but the author only spends a little more than one chapter on this.Many of the scenes take place in short vignettes. The reader hardly has a chance to get comfortable with one setting before Phillips moves us on to another scene.For the most part, I enjoyed the book. I only give it three stars because of the problems with the writing."
5,One of the greatest recordings from the Master in his prime,"Okay.... Tony Rice plays on maybe a dozen of the greatest 25 or so Bluegrass recordings ever. His solo projects are almost all landmarks. This one would have to be among the top 4 or 5 of his solo projects. His vocals are warm and soulfull and expressive. His playing, as well as Douglas, Gaudreau, etc, are state of the art. Tony's guitar style is so stunning and influential that the Bluegrass World is now filled with guitarists divided squarely between ""Rice clones"" and ""those who put as much effort as possible into NOT sounding like a Rice clone"" - in other words, Rice is the benchmark. He is the ""gold standard"". This would be true if he were NOT a great vocalist (and pity that his voice has since gone), but it is no coincidence that, for example, on the many collaborations between Tony Rice and Ricky Skaggs - RICE is the ""lead vocalist"" and Skaggs harmonizes."
5,Mastery and substance beat out style and flash,"The truest test of a great album is if it holds up to long-term listening. ""Me & My Guitar"" just sounds better and better over the years. I've given it to friends who don't particularly care for bluegrass and many come back years later saying ""you know, I listen to that cd more than any other I own."" As far as I'm concerned, for folk/bluegrass, this album is the gold standard."
3,Progressive Bluegrass Meets Smooth Jazz (Say it Ain't So),"Tony Rice interprets singer-songwriter material (Gordon Lightfoot, Ian Tyson, James Taylor, Bob Dylan), runs through a couple original progressive bluegrass instrumentals, and throws in a Norman Blake cut for good measure. Were it not for the fact that the actual bluegrass on this album is very solid, the schmaltzy Kenny-G-like saxophone that pervades through three interminable cuts would keep me from recommending this album. Ultimately, the strength of the good stuff wins out and makes this album a decent purchase. My favorite cut is probably ""Tipper,"" one of Tony's best original instrumentals. The blistering rendition of Gordon Lightfoot's ""Walls"" is nice as well. This should not be your first Tony Rice album; go with Manzanita instead."
3,Bluegrass-Lite,"There is no questioning the quality of Tony Rice's guitar playing and singing. Jerry Douglas and Vassar Clements need no intros - nor do Rice's other collaborators such as Skaggs, Rowan, Garcia, Grisham...........None the less, I can only give this disc three stars. Rice knows the earmarks of authentic bluegrass, however, much like Alisson Krauss (Who's credentials and ability I would not question), the ""new grass"" folks are discarding these earmarks and creating some new form of easy listenting ""bluegrass-lite"".In short, this disc features a whole group of superior musicians, but lacks authenticity and soul. The use of the soprano sax sounds freighteningly like Kenny G. It's time to leave Nashville (A soul-less place beholden only to the almighty dollar) and go back home to your roots."
1,NOT A REMASTER!,"This CD is listed as a Rhino 2009 product.It is NOT however a remaster but identical to the 1990original product. If you already have the original,don't buy this disc!"
3,Ronstadt at a pivotal point in her career,"Recorded at a pivotal time in Los Angeles country-tinged rock, ""Don't Cry Now"" moves Ronstadt a few steps away from her previous, and more rustic, albums, and closer to the pop-edged sheen of her later mainstream work. Although the production is muddy in places, the musicianship throughout is stellar. Standout tracks include the definitive cover version of ""Desperado"" and the bar-band staple, ""Silver Threads and Golden Needles."" Her covers of Neil Young's "" I Believe in You"" and Randy Newman's ""Sail Away"" are not quite as incisive as one would hope, but her take on Booker T. Jones' ""Everybody Loves a Winner"" is achingly true. Other quality tracks are ""Love Has No Pride"" and ""Don't Cry Now,"" both of which play to her strengths of power and subtlety. ""Heart Like a Wheel"" and ""Hasten Down the Wind"" both waited around the bend for this artist, but ""Don't Cry Now"" marks an important transitional point in her career."
5,HELP !!! I have a question !,I would love to purchase this album because it says Linda Rondstat and Aaron Neville but I see nothing where it says they ARE on this c.d. together. Are they ?If so which songs do they sing together ?ThanksDennis B.
3,Good but not great,"I prefer ""Linda Ronstadt"", the album that preceded this, for its great song selection and straightforward country-rock arrangements, and ""Heart Like a Wheel"", which followed, is simply a masterpiece. This album has its moments, but for me it's a bit overdone in places.Ronstadt is blessed with one of the great voices in pop music, but her delivery is often stiff, and some of the tracks here suffer from that. In particular, her performance on ""Love Has No Pride"" suffers from this. The definitive version of this song is Bonnie Raitt's; she owns it, and with Raitt's recording only about a year old at that point, it was just a mistake for Ronstadt to cover it.""Don't Cry Now"" was her first album for Asylum, but apparently, she jumped the gun in signing there, since she still owed Capital an album. The final album for Capitol turned out to be ""Heart Like a Wheel"", which was the real breakthrough album."
5,Outstanding Range and Depth For One So Young,"I had this in vinyl for years and finally purchased the CD. A great example of early Ronstadt, crystalline voice and great dynamic range. Her cover of Sail Away is by far the cleanest I have heard. I like Randy Newman's funky take on it but this is truly a beautiful song with that voice singing it. Desperado is soulful and pleading...perfect."
3,A little dated sounding,"The sound is a little dated and not very adventurous. Most of what I heard can already be heard on commercial radio, which is definitely is not interested in pushing the boundaries.I don't have any other comments about the music per se, but the listening experience was quite frustrating. Even with the RealPlayer Plus--I have RealPlayer G2, but I don't know why it did not load--there was a lot of breaking up of the sound. Any suggestions on how to improve the listening experience?"
5,Makes me FEEL GOOD,I originally wanted Autobahn but ordered Computer World along with it. All the tracks are great. I can listen to them over and over because they make me FEEL GOOD! I'm very happy with this CD.
4,Unfortunate indication of things to come,"With admittedly clever computer-driven tunes, this was actually a pretty good CD/Album with tunes like ""Pocket calculator,"" ""Numbers,"" (the inspiration for Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock,""),""Computer Love,"" etc. While this was not bad as a novelty, it unwittingly helped ruin pop music in the 80s as producers discovered it was cheaper to make records of preprogrammed beats than of real singing and musicianship. While this trend seems FINALLY to be on the wane, this was basically the one that strated it all. But on it's own, it's not that bad. If an absolute hater of computerized music like me can recommend it, you might wanna give it a try."
