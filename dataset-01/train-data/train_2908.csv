4,Uplifting Love Story,"Had a couple of black out spots, but only for a moment. Otherwise very good film to watch. Had never seen it before. It was recommended to us by a Doctor friend."
5,Sweetest love story,"If you've never seen this movie, watch it. If you've seen it and loved it, watch it again. Sweetest love story ever. Robert Young loved this film so much, he named his home The Enchanted Cottage! The DVD quality is very good ~ as good as can be for such an old film! It arrived in only a couple of days."
3,GOOD MOVIE -- TOO EXPENSIVE FOR RECORD ON DEMAND,This is a good movie. But these are recorded on demand as if you were recording them at home. And for that the price is too high for that type of product. Amazon is known for discounting but these are not discounted and should be. I would give it more stars if the price was more reasonable.
5,Love old movies on DVDs,I've seen this movie three times and it is really nice that I can keep them longer now that they are on DVD.Nothing compares to the original and the timeframe it took place in. I doubt that a remake will do it justice.
1,don't waste your money on this set,"The table is nice, somewhat sturdy but the chairs came unassembled and were impossible to put together properly. After following the directions carefully and spending a lot of time trying to piece the many dowels and other parts together (I shouldn't have even bothered), they are falling apart and only the children are not in danger of the chairs breaking under them. I am just throwing them out and buying different ones. I wrote a negative review previously and was then contacted by the company to rectify the situation, but numerous emails and calls went unanswered so I'm just taking it as a lesson to not buy furniture online (the description said ""light assembly required"" - who ever heard of putting together your own Shaker - style chairs!?) Do not waste your money and time on this product!!!"
5,Love this set!,"Although I agree with the above review, the chairs were most definitely a pain in the neck to put together, once we figured the right way to put one together, the others went smoothly.I love this set. It's pretty, sturdy, but as they say, it's not for commercial use. We use it in our household everyday and are extremely pleased with it. For this price, you can't beat it."
5,AMAZING LAPTOP FOR THE PRICE,"THESE LATITUDE C600 NOTEBOOKS ARE AMAZING WORKHORSES, VERY LIGHT AND DURABLE. I USE 1 AT WORK AND I LOVE IT"
4,Dell Laptop,"The computer is great, but it seems we had one or two files accidently deleted that didn't need to bein Windows XP. Oh, well. The computer is being used by a 75 year old kid in the American Red Cross logistics field. Thank you so much, he now feels like he can compete a little better in these modern times. Thanks again."
1,DISHONEST MERCHANT,"The computer I received was defective! Four of the keys did not even work, and the computer made a loud buzzing noise when turned on. I emailed the business 3 times, and never received a reply. I sent the computer back the next day and contacted my credit card company to have my account credited the amount of the cost of the computer, which they did. I would NEVER buy from this vendor, and recommend you do noteither!!"
2,Dell,"The lap top came without a wireless card so my daughter had to wait about two weeks before she could access the internet, which was the whloel purpose of getting her a laptop."
1,Beware!,"I used to have one. Like all Dell Products, it was easy broken (it overheated) and had to be replaced. Dell took forever, tried charging me, etc. Ended up wasting countless hours and money for a cheaper laptop. Find a better brand than Dell and it would be great."
2,Weight capacity and breakage,"I bought this a few years ago, and did not use it much -- had a few light weight blouses, and it worked fine. Then I added a couple more, no more than 10 pounds, according to the test I did, holding everything and standing on my scales. I did this test because the plastic that hooks over the door broke, clean off. So if you have a few, maybe 5 or 6 things you want to hang on this apparatus, go for it. But I think I'll try something a little sturdier the next time."
1,Only lasts a few months,"I bought this sometime in late January I think and it is April 7 today. It just broke. All my nicely pressed shirts are now on the floor. I am not recommending this for anyone. Nothing excessively heavy was hanging on it, only about 24 shirts and a few extra hangers. I'd keep looking."
2,MEASURE YOUR DOOR WIDTH FIRST!,"This product only fits door widths up to 1"" 5/16 inches, which was much too small to fit over my doors. The information is hidden in the paragraph labeled Product Description, but is not listed under Product Features, which is how I failed to catch it before ordering it. I called the company to complain, but they told me that the layout is under Amazon's control. Anyway, I'm hoping others will learn from my mistake."
1,Description is NOT correct,"Description indicates 40 lb. capacity. Product packaging indicates ""Holds up to 20 lbs.""To Amazon management:Please look at every listing under ""Over the door hanger"" and note how many products do not list the weight capacity.I notice in almost every category I ever search that many of the items' decriptions do not list the significant, most important feature(s) that are critical to making a buying decision.To demonstrate World Class Customer Service, Amazon needs to implement procedures to assure that each item has a description that includes all of the critical purchasing decision feature(s)."
3,Too small,"The door this was to go on is too thick for the rack to fit, so we couldn't use it at all. We should have checked on the measurements before ordering."
2,"worked really well at first, but broke","This worked so well at first, but it broke and my clothes fell to the floor after only a few months."
5,This performance is inspiring and beautiful.,"This is an extraordinary performance of Renaissance vocal music, by an all-women's chorus. The singing is restrained, and yet very expressive. I've given this CD as a present, and everyone has been amazed by it. It's not available in general, so buy it here."
1,Just Plain BAD,"I quit at about page 200. I was sick of hearing about the ""adorable"" children she had saved from the famine. If it's going to be all about that - say it in the description on the back. This had a great premise - but I will never buy another one of this author's books again. Why doesn't he tell her his name when he gets back? Why even bother with the whole fishing thing? Why do we have to hear about the children every few pages and everyone else she saved? None of this contributed to plot or character development - it was just annoying."
3,This was my first Linda Neeham book.,"I didn't think this book was all that terrible. Definitely not a 4 or 5 star one, but still not awful. Unlike the other reviewers, I liked Kate. She was a bit too perfect, though...I tend to like my heroes and heroines a bit flawed. But her heart was in the right place.I don't think a person had to be Irish to care about children starving. I thought Kate's cause to be a just one and I applauded her effort to help in any way she could.There is very little sex in this book and it doesn't happen until near the end of the book. There is plenty of romance and build up, but it definitely lacked in the actual love-making department.Overall, a decent read. It didn't compel me to read the other two in the series (especially as the 3rd one recieved terrible reviews here on Amazon)."
2,Pleasure?,"This book left me feeling disappointed. It made for such a good read, (married in haste, abandoned bride, mistaken identity,...); yet the author did not manage to make either character ""real."" Him, a street urchin (made an Earl by Queen Victoria)...right! leaves his ""wife"" 5 minutes after having married her on board a ship to return back to England. Two years later, he finally decides to meet her, only to find his estate turned into a haven for Irish orphans. From there, all goes downhill. The heroine is unlikable, and the hero? Just plain bland. Not a good read at all. Save your money here, and don't waste time with ""The Pleasure of Her Kiss""-no pleasure at all."
5,The Birchbark House,"I think Louise Erdrich wrote a wonderful book about a Native American girl who is going to become a healer when she grows up.I loved the book so much I could read it again and again.The book is sad, happy, and funny in different chapters. The book really touchs you somehow.In conclusion Louise Erdrich wrote a good book for readers of all ages."
3,"Winning characters, but not much happens","Somewhere in Birchbark House there is a good book trying to get out. Maybe that's unfair, but I like pithy, and this book is anything but.Omakayas is a seven-year-old girl adopted at about age two when her birth people all die of smallpox. She lives with the Ojibwa tribe in Minnesota in 1847. It's not clear to me whether her birth people were Ojibwa, too. The book is a year in the life of the people, including a smallpox epidemic, and a brutal winter that nearly causes them to starve. Omakayas apparently has a special affinity for bears and a talent for healing, possibly the ability to understand the spirits of the earth.Not much happens beyond disease and hunger. I generally like books with little plot, but this feels too free-form to me -- as if Erdrich just wanted to fictionalize her research into quotidian Ojibwa life. Still, at times it won me over. The characters, in particular her perky little brother, Pinch, were realistic."
5,Highly Recommend,"I ordered this to read to my six year old daughter. After having read a couple dozen pioneer-themed books together, I got the impression that no matter how much I tried to explain the Native perspective, her understanding of Native Americans was being formed by the white settlers' point of view. This book changed her way of thinking by giving her a Native American character identify with. She loved the characters and has made several ""Omakayas books"" herself, and we are eagerly awaiting the next book.One thing to be aware of is that this story deals with grief. At points it was almost too much for my young daughter, but since I was reading it to her I was able to edit out a few of the more intense passages and discuss it with her as we went along."
4,The Birchbark House,"This book is called The Birchbark House. By: Louise Erdrich. The problem in the story was that Omakayas's family fell ill with small pox.The Climax is when her little brother neewo dies from small pox.The Falling Action is when she stops eating and stays in her cabin for a couple weeks. Also when her grandma makes her eat and tells her the story of when Omakayas was found on an island by her grandma and given to this family to care for her.The Resolution isthat she gets over her little brothers death andlives happily ever after. The main character is Omakayas, she is very nice and caring even after she figured out they were not her real family.I would recomend this book to you if you like books that don't get to the climax until almost the very end of the story."
3,half and half,"We had to read the Birchbark House for a 7th grade class assignment. I thought this book was kind of interesting, because it had some funny parts and some sad parts in the middle of the story. In the beginning it was really boring. Sometimes it's hard to understand because they used a lot of Indian words but they provide a glossary. I think thee book could use some more funny and violent parts to get people interested to read more. I gave this book 3 stars because it was an o.k. book. It was kind of boring in the beginning but it got a lot better. It needed more funny parts. It was a good book but not one I would have picked. I would recommend this book to high schoolers, but they have to have a little Indian in them to understand you must like: sad, boring, exciting, and funny to enjoy this book."
4,Great for a read-aloud or parent-child shared reading,"The beginning of the book is slow. An average reader might not continue to read-on to the terrific parts. That's why I think it would be best read to a child or with a child. However, once the reader gets to Chapter 10 (The Visitor), it is non-stop, can't-put-it-down reading. The reader becomes engulfed in the sadness and joys experienced by Omakayas. Also, almost any child can identify with Omakayas' irritation with her little brother, Pinch. It is an excellent children's book to provide a view of everyday Native American life before their lands were taken and settled by foreigners. It is a good book to be read with the Little House series to contrast the Indian's way of life and views with that of early pioneers."
5,A Very Good Read!,The Birchbarck House was a fun quick read. I needed it for a Native American class and the book was a wonderful and factual sorce for information on North East Native Americans! I would say that this is a good read for anyone who wants an interesting read along with the historical backround!
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!,"This is an excellent book! I loved it! The Birchbark House is about a girl's life. That girl's name is Omayakas. Omayakas suffers a very hard life. She has a little brother who suffers a terrible disease called smallpox. This book had me thinking a lot about life and death and thankfulness. I mean if you really want something such as Pokemon supplies, stuffed animals, toys, think of the people that are less fortunate and put aside that thing that you want!"
5,A Wonderful book to read aloud,"Reading this book to my 6 and 8 year old sons has been a wonderful learning experience for us all. Some children's books drift by the adult reader, or fail to engage the kids. This one hooked us all. My 8-year-old talked about the story in school, and now his teacher is requesting that the school library order a copy since the other kids are eager to read it, too. I am ordering this copy for the teacher herself as a holiday gift. I know she will enjoy reading it, and sharing it with kids in years to come."
5,The Birchbark House,"Wonderful, realistic, accessible story for students 4th and 5th grade. This book is the first in a series of 4 books."
1,Mahatma I & II,"When I first read this book, it opened up my channeling capabilities to Source. That was the positive. The lesson for me and many other unsuspecting people out there is that this book is based on the False Intervention which strips your energies every time you say the word ""Mahatma"" and takes your own energy away from you and keeps you from ascending. This was quite a shock & dismay for me at the time. Now I just ""bless it"" and moved on without giving it a backward glance. Definitely NOT in my best interest. Anyone who wants further proof should check out the articlels out on [a website] for further validation on this Mahatma and the ""false intervention, or check with your own inner guidance from your higher self."
4,"Spotty, but very good","Follow Harry through his many personae. The strange thing is that, although the instrumentation changes you can still hear the same personality emerging through thirty years of music. And the instrumentation/production values change pretty drastically over the course of the four discs. There are a few tracks missing that should be there but aren't...a few that should not be there that are. But given how hard it's become to find some of these originals in print, it's worth the price of admission -- almost! Over thirty bucks per CD is a lot of money for any artist..."
5,This is a very good product!,"Avon Skin So Soft Soft & Sensual Roll-On Anti-Perspirant Deodorant is very effective and non-irritating. I've switched from brand to brand for years, until someone recommended Avon. The price is great, it smells super... What more could you want?"
4,Wish that I could buy another.,Great surge protector. Wish that I could get another. The only thing that I don't like is that the lights on the front are bright and their is no way to dim.
5,Big Comfy Couch Jump For Joy,"I find this video a great learning video for my toddlers. It teaches them the alphabet, that you shouldn't fight with your friends and that you should be nice to your friends, and how to wait your turn when speaking with people. Also, the video teaches children co-ordination in doing things such as dancing, jumping, and playing in general. The video is an hour long and it really keeps the attention of any child. As a mother, I have found myself singing the songs along with my children. It is a great video to watch as a family and spending time with our children. I would recommend this video to any parent with toddlers."
1,Bodybuilding???,I bought this book expecting to find useful information about nutrition for all sports as well as seeing at least one regimen from an accomplished cyclist. This book emphasized power sports and was not what I have come to expect from Dr. Burke.
3,Mediocre Book,"I'm a big Chris Pirillo fan, and I was really expecting something better than this quite frankly. While there are tons of tips and tricks (500 pages afterall), the organization is terrible. There's no index and the chapter index simply lists the 14 chapters and the pages each of them starts on. This is just terrible organization. You will certainly get a lot of tips, even if many of them are a bit old."
4,Robert Kaiser,"Besides being a thoughtful, informative chronicle of the current Democratic Peoples Republic of North Korea (DPRK), I believe this book is a must read for anyone interested in the security of the free world.It not only summarizes the history of the Korean pennisula, and the evolution of North Korea's Kim regime and its nuclear weapons program; but describes the current politics involved in both North and South Korea as well as Japan and China.It also dramatically describes the current ""clear and present danger"" that the North Korean nuclear weapons program poses to the world."
5,Tiny Bell Trio shines,"As with his string group, first time listeners to the Tiny Bell Trio may find the instrumental line up a little odd. Getting used to Trumpet, Guitar and Drums may take a few listenings. The trio tackle Kirk's Breath-A-Thon and Schumann's Nicht so schnell, mit viel along with 8 Douglas originals including the appropriately titled ""Wandering Souls"" and the burning ""Ferrous."""
5,Small town nightmare that could be right next door,I've never looked at an egg the same way since! This book scared my hair gray! The characters in this story were completely believable. The authors use of landmarks and route names makes this story utterly believable. A must read!!
5,A BOOK INTRIGING ENOUGH FOR A TEENAGER,"Im a 17 year old, and I got this book from my mother who had already read it.She had purchased it at a used book store.But anyway, I am the kind of person who likes to read but it's hard for me to find a book that I like.So when I started to read this it was amazing how wonderful it was.The plot was very believable and always kept me on the edge of my seat!I reccomend this book to anyone who likes to read or likes suspense.,"
4,A Lovely Visual Coffee Table Book,"While I haven't delved too deeply into the text, from what I can tell, it leaves a bit to be desired. The written portion of the book isn't too specific and reads like a bland list of what Nick did each year.However, the reason I bought this book, and the reason I give it four stars anyway, is because of the photographs. The photos are beautiful, chronicling Nick Cave's early years up to just a few years ago. The book is a good, large size, with plenty of photos to suit many Cave fans. If you're looking for a decent written history, I'd look elsewhere, but if it's photos you want, this is definitely worth the money."
2,Oddballz aren't fun!,"My daughter has the game Petz and Oddballz is way much more worse than that. There is no voice recomendation, no other play scenes than the play pen, no breeding, no clothes, I have talked to my daughter and I definately agree, This game is boring!"
4,Why 3 pack...?,This is the one we need and you don't sell it individually..? We happen to not have 3 pets!
2,Well written but disappointing,"There are some authors I no longer read because their work leaves me with a deep sense of hopelessness. Among these is Larry McMurtry, whose writing and story telling ability are superb, but whose life view seems to be a study in depressing shades of dark brown. I would remind such folk that the infamous box of Pandora was not empty after she opened it. The one thing that remained was hope.Red Earth, White Earth was highly recommended by a friend and is quite well written. However, I could see where it was headed about a third of the way through and lost interest. Having read my work and knowing the gut wrenching depths to which I take my readers, my friend was disappointed in my response but understood my point. Without hope, life is a cruel joke. To me, ending in despair violates the reader."
3,Not my favourite Indian cookbook.,"Ms Jaffrey does take the time to explain concepts, spices, and procedures. Unfortunately, not all the recipes seem to turn out perfectly, and the American publishers failed to edit the book well. It was originally published in the UK, and if you're not familiar with British terms and the weight system of measurement (e.g. grams of flour) you'll find it confusing."
5,Great Book for Beginners,"As an avid lover of Indian foods who has spent way too much money on take-out, I have recently decided to try cooking Indian food at home as a more economical way to enjoy those wonderful flavors and tastes found in Indian food that I just crave. I needed a book that was going to teach me the fundamentals of this style of cooking. This book has done just that. The information about all the specific spices and detailed instruction combined with numerous pictures has helped to make cooking Indian food a reality in my house."
3,okay,"This book is okay, not many great recipe Its good book for amature cooks but not something very special for people who are very much into cooking"
3,Uh-oh,"The photo is the cook book I thought I ordered, but what came was something different. I don't mind, but I still need the one I thought I bought."
2,Meh.,"I would have preferred knowing that this book doesn't contain American standard measurements. I am not great at conversion. I also don't recognize the names of some of the ingredients. Who the heck calls eggplants ""aubergines""? I don't like having to look up that kind of thing. I'm a mom... I don't have time for that!"
1,Could have been better,This could have been better. Too much emphasis on grease and spice. Recipes are inconsistent and call for hard to find ingredients. The narrative is a little condescending to the audience. I didn't appreciate the subtle slights aimed towards North America scattered throughout the book.
3,Excellent cookbook yet timeconsuming,"This is not your ""get dinner on the table quickly cookbook"". The dishes are excellent although, take from start to finish between 1-2 hours."
3,Missing and repeated pages,"World Vegetarian by author Madhur Jaffrey...The book in itself has good and simple recipes, but too few pictures and unfortunately many missing pages and a lot of pages have been repeated.Amazon should check what comes out of the printer's office as I found out only recently when I was looking for a brinjal(eggplant) recipe that the page though listed doesn't exist. Unfortunately the book being so thick I never got round to reading the entire book as I do with other cookbooks and never found the mistake till recently. I am thoroughly disappointed as I paid in full and got 3/4th of a book."
3,A good book for beginners,"This book has more than 130 authentic recipes, many enhanced by full-color photos. The original edition of this cookbook was called ""the definitive word"" on Indian cusines by the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. Heavenly aromas are a reason enough to experiment with the recipes. We, at Recipedelights.com think that this book is a good start for those who love Indian cooking or are thinking about giving it a try."
3,"Well, certainly not 5 stars.","I don't think this book is terrible. It has nice photography and the layout is easy to follow. The recipes are explained well, and are easy to follow. However, I've tried three so far, and all have been so-so. Not awful, but not something I would make again. They tasted like rather bland American cooking."
5,my seasoned bible of indian cooking,"so i've owned a copy of this book since i went away to college. the pages are ripped, splattered, stained and folded, so briefly: this is a great cookbook. sometimes i just like reading jaffrey's writing for fun because its clear she loves indian food. her instructions are clear, concise and imaginative. i couldnt even pick out a favourite recipe because over the years i;ve tried them all. if you've never tried indian food, this book will get you going. even if you fancy yourself an expert, it never hurts to have Ms Jaffrey in your court."
5,A great cookbook from a legend!,"Indian Cuisine Made Easy - Desi Dhulan Food Recipes Vol 1A fantastic book from a well known cook Madhur Jaffery! I got this book as she is a very well known cook and she has had programmes appear on BBC tv and is very well respected. I knew that I would be in safe hands when preparing any of her dishes. Great book, thank you Madhu Jaffery!"
5,i love this book.,this is the best non-encyclopedic Indian cookbook available. i use it constantly and it contains two of my top 5 homemade Indian recipes ever!
1,Little help offered here...,"Although there are a few helpful items in this book, most is utterly useless. The authors 'name it and claim it' theology offers no real help in times of need. A good portion of the book is dedicated to her ripping on her first husband and trying to justify the divorce, then praising of her new husband. You can do better elsewhere. I was very disappointed."
1,Only chapter 1 - 4 was worth reading,The book starts out great but then after the pages of ex husband slating and soppy life information I was left wondering whether this book was there to help people or a biography of the author's life? I have found books written by professionals a lot more helpful!
3,Looks Good But,"This item is an Auto Gold brand, 2x2 hitch cover with the Toyota logo, chrome face plate and stainless steel base. Seems well made, but I had to return this item since when installed, the face plate still protrudes the hitch about an 1"". This is a safety issue, especially if you have kids, who may accidently get injured with with the protruding sharp edges of the face plate."
3,"Nice piano for the price, BUT....","Piano looks good, sounds terrific. But - big BUT - this piano has a painfully user-unfriendly interface, using the piano keys for settings. For example, one might expect a simple metronome setting +/- for faster slower, and a three digit display to show you the tempo. But no. First you press the metronome key. Then you press the Setting key. Then you count up Cs from the bottom of the keyboard - holding down C speeds up the metronome, holding down B slows it. And NO way to tell where the tempo is set. That same clumsy keyboard interface is used for many of the controls. I like the piano, but the control UI is just *badly* engineered."
5,great buy - both student and piano instructor approval,"I bought this piano for my 11 yr-old daughter who is interested in piano. It is all our instructor required - 88 weighted keys and very fun. It looks great and fits nicely in our house, which did not have excessive room for a huge piano. When looking around, I couldn't find the value or look for a better price."
4,No frills blues,"Saw Albert live at a Blues festival in Mesa, AZ and he carried himself much like his album sounds. No frills, just music without an attitude. He was excellent btw. This album is not ""magical"" like an SRV record but it does what he intended to do which was just to play some darn good music."
3,Working Man,"A good record as a whole whit several themes worthy to review, good guitar with blend of Stevie Ray Vaughan and acceptable way of singing . Good modern electric Blues and i think the two songs ""Girls to shame"" and ""Rumors"" are very good Blues. I'll continue listening ALBERT CUMMINGS, I like him."
1,Not as fun as the other Song Star games,I wanted to add another game to the Sing Star collection. This one had some good songs but we ended up shutting them off half way through cause they were boring.
4,Grilfriends R Forever,"These stories shar the best and most trying times that you and girlfriends share together. No matter what has happened in your life, girlfriends are the ones who hang with you."
1,Aaaaarghhh!,"Mr. Rushkoff dedicates his book, ""To my mom and dad, for letting me watch as much TV as I wanted"". What a mistake they made! His relationship to TV is like that of the brainwashing victim to the captor.He is thorough. There is no tedium as deep as his plowing through the phenomena of Michael Jackson, Madonna, and all the rest he remembers.Along the way, he has concluded that the word ""media"" is a singular noun. Tell THAT to the folks at Merriam-Webster!Further, he doesn't know the difference between ""illicit"" and ""elicit"", and writes ""discreet"" when he means ""discrete""."
3,"Interesting, but flawed","This book has some interesting analysis of television programming and political campaigns but fails with attempts to compare pop culture and chaos theory. In this regard the author misunderstands fractals and confuses feedback (the cycling of an output back into its original source) with ordinary propagation (the progress of an output to successive new points). Since the chaos ""virus,"" to use the author's terms, pervades the book, this is a serious flaw in my opinion."
4,Works Well,"The Micropack clamps to my waistband and stays put. Works well, wish it were a little larger. I have a Motorola Droid that I like to take with me to track my workouts, but it's a tough fit. Holds other things like keys and ID with no problems."
3,Not just for runners,"This is a great product but it isn't just for runners. I coach and play soccer but hate to leave my wallet in my coaches bag or in the car. Problem is I also hate to wear regular pocketed shorts while coaching because they are a pain to demonstrate in. In comes this little extra pocket for my wallet. It fit's mine just right but it's small for tri-fold wallets. With one or two of these I can keep my wallet and keys on me and not have to wear a soccer-mom fanny pack. Also, they work great as a money belt. They clip securely and fit right under your belt line.I'd give it five stars if it was just big enough for a tri-fold wallet."
4,Great Idea,"I have been looking for something for my 6yr old to carry money in for field trips so she doesn't end up losing it.This looked like a great idea, so I ordered one for myself as well for those times when I do not feel like lugging a purse around for ID and a debit card.Well, It is super secure! The only issue is that my daughter does not like the fact that the longer part goes on the inside of your clothes. I wish they made something like this geared toward kids.Anyway, I will definitely get use out of mine, and will be buying one for my Mother as well since she does so much outdoors.All in all, a great product."
5,Don't be hesitant of the abilities of this micropack! Amazing!,"I purchased this item hesitant whether at the end of my run it would have fallen off miles back. Surprisingly, I've had the same one now for a couple of years and this is the most amazing micropack I have ever tried!! Its light and carries my ipod and a few keys. Long runs, short runs, rough hikes, even on my beach runs with water splashing on it, my money, keys and ipod stay dry and the pack stays firmly attached to my pants! You have to try this!"
3,Change Almost Anything in 21 days,"There's a big difference between saying a book is torn and a book is ripped all the way through. On the other hand, the book was shipped on time. Thanks."
1,Crowing Glory?,"I was a rabid fan of this mans first book, ""getting it in the head"". It lives up to the blurb of being poe meets borges. I was thus dying to read this. Unfortunately, this is a short story that was spun out too long. The central conceit does not ""pay off"". Unfortunately, McCormack has brought out that difficult second book. I look forward to a more mature third effort."
4,Thought provoking....,"Purchased it in Ireland when it first came out and read it while there. If you don't mind a little darkness, it is a good read."
2,Unfulfilled Promise,"McCormick opens his book with a nice Goth overlay and hints at dark mysteries surrounding his protagonist, but he doesn't end up delivering a satisfying read. Crowe regards himself with great wonder, but this self-regard seems unjustified. He's just a shy kid with long fingernails. He does nothing remarkable and a peculiar illness is the only remarkable thing that happens to him. Those grand mysteries? McCormick seems to have forgotten them by the end of the book."
2,Had potential but turned out disappointing,This book had potential but turned out disappointing. I like McCormack's writing style but the story was lacking. I couldn't bring myself to care too much about the characters or their problems.
1,Poor attention to quality and details.,"The first unit arrived without a manual. Amazon was fantastic in their customer service response and in getting a NEW UNIT to our home. (I sure wish they could have just had a manual sent to us but you have to give them credit for going an extra few miles to satisfy the customer.)The sound quality is HORRIBLE. The speakers must have cost them .03 cents each. No mid range. No Bass. Just tiny, squeaky, distorted sound.The picture quality is not that good either. Lots of distortion and not crisp at all.Within weeks and VERY little use (maybe 5 discs) the DVD player stopped working.Although it comes with a 1 year warranty, their customer service contacts appear to be in CHINA. When I wrote to them for assistance they responded. . . in Chinese.Again, Amazon stood by their product and accepted the unit as a return based on their good return policy.Thank you, Amazon!"
1,BORING TO DEATH,"I have never been so bored with a movie in my whole life. It drags eternally, and you may even get dizzy by the way it's done. Only still photographs of nature and half naked male models moving staccato, no action, no acting, no dramatic conflict. Sometimes it looks like a dated, amateurish project improvised by clumsy cinema students. Poems are well declaimed (Judi Dench, I think) but that alone does not make up a movie. I really admired the formal beauty of Jarman's CARAVAGGIO, but here there isn't anything atractive. Tiring, pretentious and over intellectual, it's far from being of any interest at all. One star I think it's too many."
1,the angelic conversation,I just saw it after buying it used. i hated it. there is no dialogue except for a woman reading a poem and strange music. i only watched half the film and turned it off. i won't say what i really thought of this. maybe to someone it would be good but i didn't like it at all. i am sorry i bought it. i only bought it because it had a guy in it that i saw in another movie and loved.
3,Stewie impostor,"I bought the Stewie Talking Dashboard Doll for my husband - thought the idea was great and the reviews I had seen turned out to be spot on. Delivery and packaging were excellent, the doll arrived in perfect condition. As a novelty item, it was everthing that I expected, but not more. Stewie's voice is a little muffled and sounds like he's hiding in deep tunnel and has a really bad cold, but otherwise my husband got a kick out of it and it served its purpose. Thanks!"
2,Valve casings machined too tightly,I purchased two of these trumpets for my grandsons. The valve casings on both trumpets are so tight that the valves jam in just a few days after applying a generous amount of PDQ valve oil. I have to use a rubber mat and a hammer to un-jam them. Very poorly machined. Made in China.
5,Wild Cats of the World,"I would highly recommend this book to any who enjoys learning about felines or any members of Carnivora. The book offers a good base knowledge of Felidae, particularly of individual species. As a reference book, I find it invaluable, with all the basic facts I need. The text is easy to read and written in an organized fashion. The pictures add a very nice touch and every species seems to be included, from lions to Andean mountain cats."
2,Waste of Money,"This book is says ""The Ultimate Reference to Every Species Worldwide"". There are a few species missing from this book, and that is being kind.It does not feature or even mention the Amur Leopard any where at all - this surely as possibly the most beautiful and rarest of ALL cats deserves a few pages and a colour photo.There is also no mention of the Chinese Mountain cat. I also noticed many other errors throughout the book.Overall, I think they need to include what species are missing - as the title is very misleading. And also include more colour photos. Black and White photos are incredibly drab and uninteresting.All in all, for the price - I found it to be a waste of good money."
2,A travesty of Augustine's work,"The absurdities produced by Wills' eccentric treatment of Augustine multiply like rabbits. One example: Wills insists on calling Augustine's son Adeodatus ""Godsend"" rather than Adeodatus. It is true that the etymology of the name roughly corresponds to ""Godsend,"" but given the fact that almost every name in antiquity ""meant something,"" this tick is supremely annoying. His translations are clunky to the extreme. He translates the classic line, ""Our hearts are restless until they rest in you"" (inquietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in te) as ""Our heart is unstable until stabilized in you.""If you have to read the Confessions in English, by all means stick with Henry Chadwick."
5,SHORT CHRISTMAS,"After being a Lionel Richie fan for at least 23 of my 27 (28 as of 1/28/2009) years, I was thrilled to hear that he was finally recording a Christmas album. I received it as a gift 12/25/2008. I ran right up to my room and played it. The songs he chose to sing were fantastic, but the album was just too short! According to the timer on my CD player, the whole CD played for less than 30 minutes! It seemed as soon as I put the CD on, I had to turn it off before I could blink! Great effort for his first take on ""Sounds of the Season,"" but I would definitely have liked a few more songs on the album."
3,Replacement handle,"I also broke the handle on this mattock, prying down on the handle too much. I am a wimp, so handle breakage will happen more often for stronger people. The wood is smaller on the long axis of the oval where it enters the plastic sleeve than an all-wood handle, and since the torsional breaking stress goes up as the cube of this dimension (says the engineer) this mattock handle breaks more easily than an all-wood handle.The replacement handle is Ames True Temper 2036900:AMES TRUE TEMPER 2036900 MATTOCK REPAIR HANDLE - 36""I put it on by using a Really Big Bench Vise to squeeze the top of the plastic until it is a bit rounder, then banging the metal tool part on with a sledge."
5,landscaping axe,"I bought this as a wedding present for my friends. I've never seen it, but they said it was great."
3,It's okay.,It's okay. Very pretty but not as well made as I thought it would be. It is a good buy if you don't use a strap that much.
2,Very Boring,"I personally found this book to be a big disappointment. The designs were extremely old fashioned and not very exciting. The details on dying fabrics were the only things worth while. If you are looking for a fantastic book on this subject look at ""The Rug Hook Book"" by Thom Boswell, it covers it all from where to get supplies, choosing fabrics (with lots of ideas for adding fun and unusual materials for texture and color), great patterns from traditional to modern. I just can't say enough. If you only buy one book.....this should be the one!!!"
5,Very good,"I only ordered this book for a test I am studying for at work for a promotion. I was really worried it was going to put me right to sleep, however I have found the book quite interesting and useful! As for dealing with Amazon...they are great!!!"
2,Most Disappointing,"Having worked in the mental health community for sometime, I was already familiar with this technique and have been using it already. I felt the book was really droll and somewhat condescending in tone. I wouldn't purchase it again. His companion book ""Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do about It"" is a more practical read and enjoyable too--I would recommend that one."
5,Information request,"In fact I am interested to publish this book in Eastern Europe. Would you be so kind and give me the address phone number and e-mail of the copyright owner? It is called F. Fournies and Associates, Inc. Thanks a lot. Janos Farkas"
5,Highly Recommended!,"Novice and experienced managers, coaches and teachers, and anyone else who wants to influence other peoples' behavior or performance will benefit from Ferdinand F. Fournies' book on coaching. He describes specific intervention tactics and shows how to apply them. Use this manual to eliminate managerial frustration. It can be your stepping stone to creating a successful, high-performing department. Fournies' concepts can help even seasoned managers deal with difficult staff, solve problems in their departments and achieve greater results through their employees. If you are a new manager or wish to be one, this essential resource and training tool is required reading. We also recommend it as a strong addition to any management curriculum."
1,Two arrived with broken base,"I ordered this lamp, and when I received it, the bolt that holds the bottom arm segment to the base was sheared off. Amazon replaced it no problem, but the second one arrived with exactly the same problem! I took that as a bad sign and canceled the order."
3,Grandrich Desk Lamp,"I waited a while before reviewing this product. I wanted to see how it would hold up. This category of desk lamps usually brings in products that are not real well made. I like the UV Light. The adjustment points have to done in a sequence, otherwise the lamp seems to fold up like an accordion. I still get a glare off of my monitor screen from the light unless I point it opposite the screen. I have had this lamp now for almost 3 months and I have not had to replace the bulb pack yet. As far as looks go, the base scratches real easy. I still find myself sort of ducking under the lamp arm to view the monitor screen. I have tried several lamps for my computer desk over the last 5 years. Although, this is probably one of the nicer ones I have purchased, I still have not found one that fits my needs 100%"
1,Do not buy this,I bought this lamp and received it today with great intrest but it made me disappointed after i open the box. The light was completly ugly and the condition was so poor. I bought it brand new which was in amazon.com but it was not appear like new at all to me.It cost me over $60.00 but the conditon and looks was not even worth $5.00.I rather buy candle then this desk lamp. I never recomend this lamp to anyone. Plase do not waste your money on it.
3,Boring...long and bland,"Kaplan is infamous for writing these long exam prep books. Honestly I really couldn't sit down and read the whole thing. I have it more as quick reference on something I need help with. I found the PCAT prep from Audiolearn more helpful--which is very complete. If you really want to buy this book, buy it used!"
3,This book is very basic,You shouldn't spend more than $10 for it. You will definetely need more study aids than this. This book is ok
2,kabar ....short?,they should call this what it actually is a letter opener. spend a little more and get a regular one
5,Artwork for your coffee table,Absolutely the most beautiful collection of photos of Mammoth and the surrounding area can be found in this book! It provides a wonderful history and insight into the creation and life of this skiing Mecca. This is a must have for any Mammoth lover!
3,GASP,"I agree. Many excellent films here. But, $765.00?---- Pick and choose. Use that cash to take a trip to Europe or Japan. Then again, if you're blowin' $765 on a stack of DVDs, you probably do have more than enough leftover to cross the ocean.Some of the best in the box:ViridianaJules et JimThe Third ManThe Virgin SpringMRashomonNOT in the box:La Dolce VitaOnibabaThe SilenceThe 400 blowsYojimboBlack NarcissusSo, it's a matter of taste, not of what was the 1st ""haddi, yaddi, yadda""."
5,brilliant,"wonderful collection - presently on sale, directly from janus/criterion, for $650. Why not match that, Amazon? :)"
5,a book I loved sharing with my children,"I found this book at a yard sale when my children were small. It is all about what can happen with a small boy and a big imagination!! My two loved this book, so much that it was loved to death. Wishes become reality on a bad day when a small boy is bored and starts wishing for something to relieve the boredom.."
1,Tedious and boring,"I slogged through this book, hoping it would eventually get better, but it never did. There was no real suspense, nothing to grab my interest. And to top it all off, the ending was stupid."
2,Body Rage Nail Art,"I found this to be a horrible product. First off, the CO2 cartridges only last long enough to do one hand. So it takes at least 2 of them to do both hands. They aren't the same size as the ones you can buy at the store, forcing you to order them from here, they are too expensive. The airbrush system itself is awful,,the paint comes out in spurts and is very gloppy when it comes out, doesn't spray in a uniform even flow. Also, it doesn't inform you as to what kind of paint to use when the tiny bottles that come with it are gone. I don't recommend this product."
1,Very Disappointing,"I wish I had read the first review before I bought this product. I am in complete agreement with their review. I had run into all the same problems with this produce. C02 doesn't last for more that one hand and is a different size than the standard refills and when it does work, it is very average. I would not recommend this at all. Not worth the effort."
2,Confusing photos,The current (2011) two photos are confusing and inconsistent.One photo show prongs for two outlets on the back.The other photo shows a very different configuration on the back!
4,a fun book,"Okay, so it's *not* particularly based on the tv version of ""Witchblade"". It's not really a problem either. The storyline is still easy enough to follow even if the TNT show is all you've seen. It only takes a little while to adjust to the slightly different spin and then it's an entertaining read. So there's no Danny, Dante, or Gabriel and Joe's still on active duty. Ian is autonomous and Jake knows there's *something* going on with the Witchblade even if he isn't quite sure what it is. Irons and Sara are almost completely recognizable in their tv forms though, and their scenes together have some of the most amusing dialogue of the book. The paranormal aspects are interesting (although I was rather reminded of Zelazny's Merlin, who created a sentient magical computer named Ghost Wheel - If you've read both you'll see the triple connection) and the shadow world was fascinating. So it's not Pulizer material, but it's still an enjoyable, recommendable story for a casual read."
3,Super Reader,"This starts off as a pretty much straight forward cop story, with the occasional Witchblade mention. Things start to accelerate after that, with Romanian grandmothers, a werewolf, a Mah Jong white snow dragon, and that is just in the slower middle part of the book.There is a crazy confrontation at the end, fueled by a magic sentient computer, a Kabbalah-hacker-artiste, a dragon, a two page cameo by Dracula, for no apparent reason, who also fails to keep his head, Nottingham, the magic summoning teleportation of a police captain, a fire extinguisher, some bird alien race through the portal of a computer, a god, and some deific temptation for Sara.She says no, and discovers that just possible the sneaky entity on her wrist was behind it.Fairly straightforward, but madcap ending, perhaps somewhat rushed, not sure if there was a word count mandate?"
2,Not nearly as compelling as the TV series or comic book,"Since this book is supposedly based on the TV show (or so it says on the cover) I would have to say it fails miserably. Not once could I picture Yancy Buttler as the Sara Pezzini portrayed in this book. The story was weak. The characterization was weak, and I even found a few spelling errors in the text (in the same chapter no less).Bottom Line: Read it if your bored. Otherwise, stick to the comic book and the TV show."
2,"""Based on the hit series""? Uh ... NO!","If you're expecting this to be based on the Witchblade television series (from, say, the copy and Yancy Butler on the front cover), think again. It's based on the comic. That's fine if you like the comic. Read away. Not so good if you wanted to read about the TV version. ""Forewarned is forearmed."""
3,The History of Christianity,"It's a good series but the first two DVDs spent too much time on the Christmas story with too much conjecturing. A slow start, but with the 3rd DVD the series gets more into interesting church history. Obviously, the entire series is a composite with different narrators which makes it feel a bit disconnected. Overall, it's a good value for the price."
4,Looks great works great,"Cover does not fit perfectly over fj cruiser fairlead it was too tall but it does work and is easy to take off. If you parallel park and bump into the car ahead of you it will fall off though, so that's why only four stars. Also cost is high. Used in California but took on road trip to Colorado in winter and it stayed on fine even on highway."
2,"Ironically funny, or purposely misogynistic?","The Underpants is a 1910 play written by Carl Sternheim. Mr. Martin has re-written it in an attempt to turn it from a farce into a broad comedy. I saw it performed in 2011 at the Beck Center for the Arts, and I then I read it, also.While the play is amusing at first, it grows tiresome. The (somewhat) sexual escapades of bored housewife, Louise, quickly take on the likeness of a wacky episode of ""Three's Company."" But without John Ritter's pratfalls, the jokes begin to fall flat, and the play drags on and on.The inherent male-dominance of the day becomes misogyny at times, and after awhile, I was left wondering if some of those lines were supposed to be ironically funny, or just mean.This is not a play I would see or read again."
4,When it comes to Jewish history and culture...,"When it comes to Jewish history and culture you can't be too educated. I found this Complete Idiot's Guide very informative. This funny book contains an AMAZING amount of facts. It starts from Abraham and goes all the way to the present. It also covers a huge geographical space. The book contains historical sketches of Jewish communities all over the world: from South America and New Zealand to Sweden and Denmark. The part about culture is also very interesting. This chapter is packed with biographical sketches of writers, actors and scientists ""...Wow, did you know HE was Jewish too?..."". Sometimes the author is a being a bit simplistic. You feel like reading a bedtime story about the bad guys and the good guys. On the other hand, the Rabbi's sense of humor is great, so I was never bored."
2,Not so good; his previous book was much better,"I was initially very hopeful about this work, as I was familiar with the author's previous works. However upon opening this new book I disovered that it was shallow to the point of being useless. It says almost nothing about each topic. His descriptions are so brief as to be either useless or outright misleading.The sad thing is, he *did* write a perfect book for people who want an introduction to Judaism That book is ""Understanding Judaism : The Basics of Deed and Creed"", and I highly reccomend it.More good books in this is area are Wayne Dosick's ""Living Judaism""; ""Entering Jewish Prayer"" by Reuven Hammer; ""Biblical Literacy"" by Joseph Telushkin; and the Jewish Catalog series by Michael and Sharon Strassfeld."
3,Great Introductory Volume but Short On Detail and Depth,"If you are looking for the very beginners level 101 on Jewish Culture and History, then this is the book for you. If you desire a more detailed explanation of events and more depth into the cultural aspects of Judaism, then I'd recommend you skip this book and look elsewhere. I did not think that I was well versed in Jewish history, but after reading this book, I found that I knew more than I thought, for I did not learn all that much. I did learn about some culture, but not enough detail to satisfy me.Again, this is the ground-level introduction to Judiasm. If you want to learn the framework on Jewish history and culture, then this is a great place to start. If you already know some things about the Jews and their extraordinary history, then this book will be much too simplistic.kone"
4,Great Information,This book provides a lot of information regarding a subject where there has been little research. Easy to read.
1,PASS on This Product!! Rubber is too stiff,"I would not recommend this particular squeegee. The rubber blade is too hard, does not bend around the curves of the vehicle as expected, and is thereby rendered useless. It scrapes across the surface of my car, not gliding across to remove the water like it should."
4,Good Squeegee,"Nice large squeegee, have to be careful not to get any dirt on it or it will cause problems."
1,where's the book?,"the delivery extimated was July 27, today is august 7, and haven't received the book, where is my book?"
5,very happy,item as described. shipped fast. good job. essential accessory for total gym xls especially for someone who is maxing out on it. in other words the better you get you will need this accessory to add weight to it. very happy with this perchase.
4,great game for older kids.,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son. He had seen a preview for it on nickeloden. He wanted this game so much because it has all of his favorite cartoons in it. The controls are difficult to use, and the tasks are a little complex for him. when we play usually me or my husband ends up playing it for him. All he really wants to do is beat up on the bad guys. His favorite part of the game is being the gorilla in danny phantom's world. It is a great game if more than one person is going to be playing. If you are looking for a game that is easier for smaller children I recommend star wars legos. my 5 year old can control the game with ease, and with little or no help from me."
3,To Be played by more than one person.,My son alway have fun when he is playing this game with more than one person.
4,Fun Game!!!!!!!!!!!!,It is a really fun game. But you might have a bit of trouble with the Jelly Fish Factory level. Besides that it is really fun and easy to understand. I am 9 and think it is a great game. My Mom is letting me write this review.
5,Bottle this young man's voice and sell it!,"First and foremost, John Cowan's resonating tenor voice would send shock waves through a polar ice cap. The hair on my arms stood up the entire concert. The way the album is mastered, it's one long continuous medley that's over far too quickly. The arrangements are laid out in an order that flows like a river. John mixes styles on this recording that range from blues to southern rock to Celtic soul in a most indelible piece of work. Cow band rocks on this, especially fiddler Shad Cob and mandolinist Wayne Benson. Didn't think it was possible for JC to improve, but he continues to outpace himself. One for the collector's list and posterity. Tattoo transfer was a really cool bonus!"
5,Great CD,"I saw John Cowan perform New Tattoo on CMT. I liked the song and listened to clips of the remaining songs. They sounded good so I bought the CD. It was well worth it. John Cowan is a heartfelt singer, and the songs are all very good, from fun songs to quite serious songs about child abuse. I recommend this CD highly."
4,"smooth texture, wish it had SPF","I understand what the other reviewer meant about the funny smell of this product, although it doesn't really bother me. I love the smooth texture of it, and like the subtle shine without being glossy. Too bad it doesn't offer sun-protection."
4,Hexen II hits the spot!,"It's hard to say exactly what's so undoubtedly great about Hexen II. Maybe it's the dark, brooding atmosphere that lingers everywhere, maybe it's the terrific fantasy/medieval setting, or maybe it's a great implementation of Heretic's and Hexen's gameplay formula on a modified Quake engine. In any case, it's a classic FPS that almost-but-not-quite borders on being a full-out FPS/RPG in the way that System Shock and BioShock are (except not as futuristic)."
1,TALIA SHIRE VEHICLE? - MAYBE-MAYBE NOT.,"AS A TALIA SHIRE FAN, I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO NOTE SHE ONLY HAD A CAMEO IN THIS PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, SHE HAS EXECUTIVE-PRODUCED BY HER COMPANY TALIAFILM.LTD., THIS TALE OF ALIENS THAT LOOK LIKE HUMANS COMING DOWN TO OUR PLANET EARTH AND CHECKING TO SEE IF IT BENEFITS THEIR SPECIES TO LIVE. THE TALE IS TOLD FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF 2 ALIEN GIRLS AND THE NEW HUMAN FRIEND THEY FIND IN A BOY, WHO ALONG WITH HIS MALE GUARDIAN, WELCOME THEM TO THIS WORLD AND LET THEM EXPERIENCE LIVING AS WE DO. THIS FILM IS BEST SUITED TO YOUNG CHILDREN AND THOSE VIEWERS WHOSE INTERESTS LIE IN THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL."
5,Journey to Topaz,"Yuki is a Japanese-American girl who lives with her parents and brother in Berkeley, California. When Pearl Harbor is bombed, authorities come to take her father away for questioning. Yuki, her mother and brother are evacuated to a camp in California for Japanese. Forced to live in a horse stall, the family struggles to survive admits the horrible conditions. After a few months they are transferred to the Utah desert, where they continue to persevere despite their loss of freedom. Although fictional, the story is based upon the author's experiences during WWII. The Japanese interment in the United States is often overlooked, yet it is a period of history we must remember."
4,Gently introduces children to a difficult period in our history,"Well written, informative historical fiction by an author who lived this experience. This is the introductory work in a series which describes and personalizes the experiences of Americans of Japanese ethnicity who were confined in concentration camps during World War II.Recommended for elementary / adolescent students. Some material may be disturbing for younger readers: a kind, sympathetic character is killed by a trigger-happy security guard toward the end of the book. Few details are given -- the man ""crumples,"" and it is explained later that, indeed, he died. Despite the emotionally challenging nature of this material, the author's careful, sensitive treatment provides a gentle introduction to a difficult topic.Overall, a beautiful book, the first in a lovely series."
4,Journey to Topaz,"Journey to topaz is a story that takes place during world war II. The main characters are a japanese-american family that is sent to an internment camp.They are put through many trials testing their will.I think this book is a wonderful story because it shows the reader what life was like at that time from the view of a person put into the camp.A girl named Yuki is sent to an internment camp with her family, but her father is sent to a different camp. They were sent to this camp after the Pearl harbor bombing. In the camp, Yuki meets Emi, a girl that becomes her friend. When the family is released, Ken, Yuki's brother, wants to join the army and fight for the U.S.A."
4,Internment from a child's point of view,"This was interesting to me since my mother was about Yuki's age when she went to ""camp"". My mother doesn't talk much about that time, maybe because some things you just want to forget. It helped me understand some of the fear and prejudice towards Japanese Americans during the war. I have mixed feelings about the internment. It was horrible how so many people lost their livelihoods, but on the other hand, in camp, they were sheltered from the hatred and hostility they may have experienced at home. This was wartime, so everyone was feeling some kind of unhappiness. I give this book 4 stars and 5 stars to Uchida's ""Journey Home"", the story which follows Yuki's family out of camp."
5,Well Worth Your Time,Hi I am an 8th grader in Rhode Island. I had to read this book for school. I really enjoyed this book. It is based on a Japanese family being sent to a concentration camp during WW2. I think that this book is a good eye opener for those of us who had no idea what happened. It is a well written account and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
1,Not as advertised !!,"According to their customer service dept, this product DOES NOT have any adrenal hormone in it! So, even though the label says it contains Adrenal Cortex, all the hormones have supposedly been removed. If this is so, then this product is worthless. In order for the adrenal glands to recover from Adrenal Fatigue they need the cortisol hormone!"
1,"Not a bad cream, but my purchase didnt work out for me","I've use this cream before and it works great for my dry skinBut heres what happened, it didnt have a seal inside the container... so it leaked inside the shipping box... oil everywhere!!! I've used this cream before but this looks nothing like what i used... it looked like a big chunk of fat... and oil dripping like a bbq stake... its wasnt creamy at all... doesn't smell good either.. smells old... I bought it because of the price.. and now my money just went down the drain... i cant use this... i rather drive to rite-aid and pay few dollar extra :-/"
3,Cocoa butter creme,"This cream is very reasonably priced, however, I didn't like the creme itself. It spread on nicely but it was very oily. Didn't seem to absorb very well. Felt very greasy and I was afraid it might stain my clothes. Good to put on if your skin is very, very dry."
5,Just a Great Book!,"This is a terrific book by a great artist! I have been a fan of Al's since the late 60's-I must have listened to Super Session over a hundred times. This book is very funny, revealing, and candid. Al pulls no punches and tells it like he saw it.Always at the right place at the right time-or as he said it he had to be at every right place, every time! Whether it was sittin' in with Bob Dylan when Al was not even supposed to be in the studio or discovering Lynyrd Skynyrd; Al was there and made it happen.A great book about Al, the record business, and gives great insight into some of the key musical events/artists of our times.Thanks Al for all the great music and for this book that gives us all a glimpse into your eclectic, amazing career."
4,Eye opening what can be required to stay in the music business for 50 years.,"I am convinced that this is an honest portrayal of life in music during the early days of Rock. Al Kooper is someone who seems comfortable in his own skin and I admire his honesty. We as fans never really think about all the adjustments necessary for a musician to ""stay in the game"". I can't think of too many musicians gone producer like AL Kooper and I found his journey very compelling.For a guy that could easily be bitter about some of his dealings in the industry, I find his attitude admirable.Slow start (as are most Rock books), but worth a read. Unlike any other musicians book that I have read."
4,what is cleveland waiting for ?,"kooper's career as told in this book takes the reader everywhere in the rock world as it evolved in the late '50's& into the '60's& 70's he was there making,creating & finding the music of the times. kooper the artist,innovator,personality is on full view and i enjoyed the ride.until al kooper is inducted in the rock & roll hall of fame it remains hollow & illegitimate as each year passes and more phonies & plagerizers enter."
3,Hit and Miss,"This book is most definitely a mixed bag. The parts regarding the Lynyrd Skynyrd and Bob Dylan sessions are quite captivating. The brutal honesty really shines through in those sections. However, the solo career and Super Session material is quite boring as those parts really portray Mr. Kooper as just another studio musician. There is a point where it all sounds the same, this was the guitar player, and that was the drummer and we made this kind of music and smoked this type of weed and had these hassles. What impact did these alleged Super Sessions have on the music industry? I'll tell you what, absolutely very little if not nothing. In addition, Mr. Kooper's style does not fully tune you into his world. He assumes that you know what he is talking about without gramatically introducing you to how he got affiliated with a particular group. Also the changes are not connected too well. Many interesting stories but this could definitely have gone alot deeper in spots."
4,The life adventures of Al Kooper,I enjoyed this book but for some reason I felt I didn't respect the writer Al Kooper after I had read it. At times I didn't feel sorry for him because of his life style choice in drugs and partying and not respecting the 3 or 4 wives he has had and letting down people who trusted him.I respect the work he did with Mike Bloomfield and Lynyrd Skynyrd and Bob Dylan. Some of the stories are very enlightening and funny.Al is a great story teller but rushed past many things like how he went on the sessions of Electric Ladyland and many other important issues are glossed over.I guess there are only so many pages that can be filled.
5,Al Kooper: One of a kind,"One of the great rock musicians of all-time. This guy should definitely be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in fact he should have his own wing. Great writing throughout, this is the most entertaing rock and roll book that I've ever read. One of the finest memoirs I've ever read for that matter. I wish he would write more."
1,Bom-Crioulo,I ordered the book in English and received the Portugese version. I dont speak Portugese and the delivery was ridiculously slow. Terrible service
1,C'mount lens,"I have returned the lens because I could not use it.I needed a lens with built in iris.Your description did not mention the lack of an iris.Most c'mount lenses come with a built in iris.It would be useful if your description would address this question.Thank you,Otto Schiff"
4,Good for beginners,I highly recommend this video for beginners who don't have the luxury of a martial arts gym nearby or just those trying to learn some basic fighting techniques for their own knowledge. I personally haven't had any real formal stand up training and I found this video to be very informative.

3,Sanderson Plumbing review,"Product is very nice, customer service for it was abyssmal. Wrong product sent, even though on order form correct. Called roughly a dozen times to correct as it was a christmas present. Could not get through automated voice system, or dropped, or not called back. Weeks later, I finally got it replaced. It is very interesting, but cannot recommend vendor at all."
3,More than double the price I paid a few months ago !!,"I originally paid $ 23.00 for this item, now it is $ 49.00 Yikes !!It's cheaper in the stores."
2,I don't think his heart was in it,"When Haggard came to ""write"" When the World Shook, he'd been dictating his novels for a quarter of a century, I believe. It was obviously easy to spin out the wordage with dialogue, and the dialogue in this one is about Life and Fate and the Beyond and so on, and isn't very absorbing. I've read something like 20 of Haggard's novels, and this would be one of the poorest half-dozen. I should say, though, that if it were by some other author I might rate it more highly. Haggard did much better elsewhere."
3,A Decent Springboard,"This book and other like it have to be taken for what they are. Springboards to solid ideas. No, I have no desire to write about the pitfalls a vegetarianism, but it got me thinking about other lifestyles and habits we commonly see and what their pitfalls may be, whether political, financial, emotional or otherwise.Many of the ideas are simply too broad to be used as they are. Instead, they are great to get you thinking in new directions and find some facet of a broad issue that intrigues you enough to write about it. I use the book to help me come up with ideas for articles. The final product is often far removed from the phrase that launched it."
1,these ideas are not at the college level!,"at least not at the level of anyone at my college, anyway. i found this book to be of absolutely no use to me. maybe ill give it to my twelve year old sister. furthermore, i was very disappointed in the non-neutrality of the selection of topics. it is obviously that ms lamm is very conservative. the pitfalls of vegetarianism? the pros and cons of womens rights? what cave did she just crawl out of? i hope her eyes adjusted to the light before she wrote her second edition."
3,Fluffy and sweet,"This is perfect if you want something ooey and gooey and lovey-dovey. It advertises that it asks deep questions about love, but all it does is barely brush the surface of things such as age, what ""cute"" means or how people can transition from dating into a marriage. It seems to be based quite a bit on the author's actual experience, so it's pretty interesting to read their little introductions before each short story. The characters are drawn beautifully in Clamp style...but it IS a slender volume, so may not be quite worth the price they are asking for."
1,why.,"this... was really bad. the book is comprised of several... you can't even call them stories because they are all around 7 pages in length and go no where. they all hint at a possible story, but none of them actually puts in any time to create something worth reading. it's more like a collection of possible love story ideas someone else could write about if they wanted to write a romance... but chances are that someone interested in writing a love story would already know about possible plot twists... making this completely and totally useless!! i can't see how anyone could read this excuse for a collection of decent plot lines and call it a nice collection of love stories, and the art is grade b. there is nothing redeemable at all... it's just so horrible. and pointless. honestly, why."
3,Re-Drill,Had to first ream out hole to fit class III hitch on 74 Bronco. Perhaps multiple punch out holes would be adviseable
3,Left hanging,"Ok first the good news. I loved Geary's writing style, her characters were very real and her descriptions very poignant.Now the bad news. I kept turning pages expecting some kind of answers or a conclusion but got absolutely nothing other than some very Budda like statements ""If you believe it happened then why does it make a difference if it did or not?"". You never find out what happened to Deane, you never find out anything about Sammy. I'm assuming that Alonso and Barnett are angels (can't remember what she called them) but that just makes part 2 and part 3 almost exact copies of each other.So I would say it was an enjoyable experience up until the end when you realize none of your questions are going to be answered. Some people love endings left open for speculation, others hate them. If you don't hate them, read this book it's good, especially if magical realism is your 'thing'."
2,Clever idea that falls far short.,"An outline of this book would be riveting. It's basic framework is smart and has a great deal of potential, but then the writing undoes it all. Powers spends too much time proving how very clever and erudite he is, dropping names and obscure references at every opportunity, and winds up neglecting the compelling part of the story. It was painful in places, particularly wading through the heavy-handed techno-geek dialogue that tropes being hip, but winds up sounding affected and self-indulgent. The secondary plot, as others have mentioned, is far more compelling than the primary plot. Scores of pages are spent fetishizing technology and 'The Cavern'. It's really cool, Richard. We get it. If Powers spent more time on his character development and less time trying to impress us with his unabridged thesaurus, this would be a far more enjoyable read."
3,An incomplete tale,"Plowing the Dark contained many memorable passages. The language was challenging and imaginative. However, the story lacked the power and punch that his earlier works had.The split narrative reminded me of Operation Wandering Soul, but Plowing didn't have the same raw impact of its predecessor. Mr. Powers began many tales, and then decided not to pursue them further. The afflicted former boyfriend demanded more attention than he got; he was far too complex to be just a plot device for a tonal piece to set the finale to. Also, Jackdaw just disappears. Mr. Powers hadn't shied away from delving into the very personal lives of his characters, but Jackdaw served his purpose and was dispatched. I can't determine if those two examples are just indications of a tale told too fast, or of characters intended for a singular purpose and then dismissed with the purpose was achieved.Plowing was worth the time; however, it doesn't compete on any level with his earlier works."
3,"Entertaining, but takes itself too seriously","This was definitely worth reading, at least in terms of content/time spent ratio. The book moves along pretty quickly, but begins to lose its way sometime after its half-over and excepting some pretty parallells between life in the lab, outside world, and that of the hostage in Lebanon does not live up to its promising beginning. At least that is my opinion. Descriptions of technology are not bad for a fiction book even if I would have preferred having even less of it mentioned. All auxilary characters are completely flat and even some of the more promising ones end being not used at all. Flashbacks are very well written, but end up not quite connecting with the present for most of the characters. Doom and Gloom rule the day in the end. Read it if you are going on a long train ride or aflight, but I do not expect to ever re-read this book."
4,"It's the singer, not the song","Richard Powers is certainly a master of language. I would argue that this is as much a prose poem as a novel, full of beautiful and original images. And the Lebanon story is emotionally powerful. But I found Adie Klarpol a wan heroine, making a great struggle out of pretty ordinary difficulties. And the ending...no way, Jack. Powers is a great singer, but this isn't much of a song. In all, not up to the admittedly high standard set by the Gold Bug Variations. PS: I'm guessing that the VR lab is based on the HITLab (Human Interface Technology) Laboratory at the University of Washington."
2,Don't let this be your first Richard Powers book,"I picked this book up after reading The Echo Maker, which was fantastic. This one, however, is not.The bad metaphors and a sharp knife, penetrating your mind. The jargon-dropping and abuse of technical words is stultifying. If you've ever had a course in computer engineering, computer science, or math, you'll cringe at every misused simile. Every character is having the most profound insight of their entire lives in every sentence - the TerraSys portions read like a bad parody of Ayn Rand.There are some redeeming features... I kept reading for the secondary story, of the kidnapped English teacher, where the writing is tolerable and the plot more interesting.Richard Powers is a very good writer, but this is not an example with which you would want to defend that statement."
2,Hostage: the Game?,"This novel was one big disappointment. The author, who clearly has a background in computer programming and games, has tried to rise above this background into the realm of novel writing, great literature even. In this he falls flat on his face. His overblown language just doesn't fit the material. It was the opposite of a page turner, more of a page groaner (""Oh, no, not more of this!) His ending is unsatisfying, trite, a cop-out. He comes across as just a computer hacker who can now surf the Web for interesting facts with which to fill his amateurish novels, sorry. The one good track was the hostage, but the use of 2nd person made it seem like a new text adventure game where the reader unfortunately couldn't interact. ... Final summation: toss it into a deep dark cave."
1,Horrible Quality DVD - Do Not Purchase,"I own an old VHS copy of this movie. As a fan, I have been waiting for the DVD of this movie for a long time. When I saw that there was finally a DVD release of this movie, I purchased it--- But the purchase turned out to be a mistake. The image and audio quality of this DVD-R are horrible. The video is blurry, the movie bounces around the screen, and the audio track sounds awful. My old VHS tape actually looks and sounds better. Do not purchase this DVD-R."
4,My God....,"This movie was asolutely hilarious. The Scientist is a freak and can get somewhat annonying, but when he goes on his killing spree, I couldn't stop laughing. The sandwich scene had me on the floor. Rent this if you have nothing to do, it's hysterical."
4,This is a movie for the rest of us.,"Like most americans, I realy don't care about microcosms of society or reflexive metaphors of society. When I see a movie, I just want to enjoy it. That is exactly what this movie is all about. Though it starts off a little slowly, when it does get going it's well worth it. I don't think anybody who sees this movie will ever look at a sandwitch the same way again."
3,Little of substance and too few good stories,"I picked up this book with the reflection that long-time journalists (e.g., Theodore White & Walter Cronkite) write some very interesting memoirs. Bob Shieffer must have saved the good stories for his other book. Instead of his personal reminisces, we mostly get a self-congratulatory history of the Face The Nation program, and its place in CBS News and as (just) one of the Sunday interview shows.Even though this is a short book, it feels padded. Shieffer discusses how Face The Nation covered the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, 9/11, and Monica Lewinsky (he thinks it was appropriate for the show to feature that story on 49 Sundays in 15 months). Still, it is interesting and useful to remember how journalists once asked MLK if he shouldn't be more patient, and refused to take woman politicians seriously."
2,Too greasy!!!,"I didn't like this product. I had used it 5 years ago and never finished the bottle and remembered why I hadn't. I got the smallest size-6 oz. It smells like bacon which I don't mind if the results are good. I unfortunately didn't experience any hair growth while using this product, but instead had very dry hair, and grease dripping down my forehead.I also had a breakout from the sulphur and grease.Unfortunately this product didn't work for me, but I hope it works for someone else!"
2,You Should Know This,Vendor was excellent. But the product itself smells AWFUL and did not have the desired effect.
2,It's alright,"M-T-G oil has a lot of sulfer in it which made my hair dry. I have been trying different oils that work for my hair... and M-T-G didn't work for mine. It may work for you, I've heard many good things about M-T-G. Also it doesn't smell that good which doesn't bother me."
4,Helpful,"I also have been using it for almost a year (Oct. 19th 2012 will be a year). I do not see much growth because I always wear a lace front, but I make my mommy braid my hair and she always says that it's getting thicker. She did her research on this product as well as many other products to grow African American hair long and your hair is supposed to get thicker first and then get length from what she read. I am waiting for the length to kick in since my hair was already thick before using this product. I only bought the product to see if I can get my hair to around my armpit. Well the back of it.The thing I can vouch for is it made my bangs grow longer but that is about it. I do like the product and continue to use it about twice a week at night."
4,"Great product, poor packaging...",I received the product in a bad packaging that caused the bottle to leak a 1/3 of its fluid. But the product is awesome and i recomment MTG for people wanting to promote thier hair growth.
3,Smelly stuff!,"I only used this once on my horse, so I really haven't noticed any difference, hence the neutral, 3-star rating. But I can tell you that it was really greasy upon application and had a strong fake/chemically smokey bacon-ish odor to it. My barn manager actually thought there was a fire burning near the barn due to the odd aroma. I will try it a least one more time on my horse's mane and tail to see if it thickens and lengthens the hairs. If not, the greasiness may make it at least a good conditioner."
3,it ok,it smell very bad i did grow my hair but i got some marks on the back of my neck from useing this product please get the one for humans hopefully it wont leave a chemical burn or marks on your neck
2,Didn't get rid of Rain Rot,"I didn't like it because it stinks, it didn't get rid of the Rain Rot. It didn't have a spray handle on it. Sorry I didn't find anything good about this product."
3,Late,Product arrived very late and I had a horse with a bad case of scratches. Actually the product was not effective even after I finally received it.
3,I want to like this more.....,"I can NOT get passed this smell! I know I purchased this for an ""off label"" use. I've been hearing so much about people using it and it making their hair grow like crazy! I'm sure had I continued using it I may have seen results. I'm sure its from the sulfur. I just couldn't...I couldn't even mask the bbq smell! I bought some sublimed sulfur and mixed my own oil. The seller was prompt and I received my item fast."
1,It's okay.,"I purchased this product because I read many reviews on it how good it grows people's hair. I mixed it in a spray bottle with castro oil, olive oil, and other products, but over time, I really didn't see any results. And not to mention the smell, it's horrible. I will not be purchasing this again."
1,Smells too bad!,"I used this product twice and have not used it since. I put it in my hair before bed, wrapped my head with a plastic cap and silk scarf. The smell was so bad, it would constantly wake me up. I washed it out in the morning and conditioned my hair but the smell still remained for the about 4 more days. I tried it again the same exact way and the same thing happened all over again. It even seeped into my pillows and I had to wash those too. My face even broke out. Even if the product really does grow the hair, for me, it's not worth it. I don't plan to ever use it again. I would only recommend people that don't have sensitive skin and can take horrible smells to use this product."
3,I don't know yet but it smells horrible,"I just bought this product after doing a lot of research. Hopefully, this product will help me to grow out my edges and the nape of my neck after breaking off from wearing weaves back to back. It does smell really bad because of the high amount of sulfur that it contains but I've been applying this product at night before bed and wrapping my hair in a silk scarf to protect it. Fortunately, the smell is gone by morning. Let's see if it works!"
1,Such a Shame,"In the name of design Sennheiser has sacrified comfort. I bought these headphones based on their reputation for quality sound, which they do have it, but all is lost in poor design. The earbuds do not stay in place, and they are very uncomfortable. I will go back to my $ 9.99 Sony headset."
2,"Great design, lousy durability",These are good enough that I bought a second pair when the first ones wore out. Sadly they ALSO disintegrated -- and faster than the first. The wires' rubber coating cracked and separated from the ear buds. Beautiful but almost zero longevity.
4,"I love these, but you might not","I love these headphones. I want something lightweight that I can carry with me at all times. These are perfect for exercise, where they don't fall out of my ears, but can easily be removed from my ears and wrap around my neck. In-ear headphones always feel uncomfortable and fall out of my ears. I find these quite comfortable and practical.The way they fit on your head is very unique and needs some practice to get used to. The earbuds go in your ears and then the strap goes over your ears and behind your head, descending almost to your hairline (so if you had a ponytail it would go above the strap). I find this flexible strap much better than the stiff behind the head option that prevents me from resting my head against a headrest and is easy to break."
2,Another set of heaphones!!!,"Saw these Sennhesiers on Tiger Direct for $10, and without searching for user reviews, bought a pair. I totally agree with the other folks who said that these just don't fit very well. I would describe the head band as a spring loaded knot in a set of shoe laces...totally frustrating. Sound quality isn't bad, but could use a little more bass. Of the three bud covers, none sat in the ear well, probably because of the torque from the flexible headband. Personally, I think Sennheiser should include step-by-step instructions on how to put these on...the lone picture isn't enough.These go into my pile of brand new headphones that only get used when my Sony Fontopias break."
2,Sennheiser LX70,I'm sure these are good quality headphones but I returned them because I couldn't get them to fit properly. I did buy a different set of Sennheisers as they are a great product
4,A great stocking-stuffer or incentive gift,"My kids love these little books with magically appearing pictures. I prefer these to the ""invisible marker"" books because all you need is a pencil. The topics are for fairly young children, probably not over age 6. I broke up the set to use as incentives for my young piano students."
4,slides,the slides were all that we had expected we look forward to preparing our own slides we received them quickly and in a nice protective case i would recommend these slides for other beginners like us
5,Great with Toy Microscope,The slides were ordered to be used with the toy microscope offered by Amazon. They provided hours of fun for my grandson and his friends.
2,Disappointing,I found these slides to be very dissapointing. There is a lot of dust in them and several were cracked.
2,Never arrived,This product did not ship with the microscope and related items. The lack of this item made the rest of the purchase useless until it could be purchased locally which delayed the classroom presentation by a week.
5,Great with microscope,My daughter got this with her first microscope for Christmas and she loves it. There's a ton of different things for her to look at under the microscope. Fun and educational for her.
5,Excellent gift,I was very satisfied with the quality of the product. My 10 year old son loved them and I'm learning a lot too!
4,Fulfills its purpose,"This is a useful introduction to the microscopic world around us, and has sparked an interest in it for my six year old grandson. I am very satisfied with it."
3,get what you pay for,"I had low expectations for these slides. They are made in China and packaging is OK.The slide surfaces were filthy andI had to clean before use. Some of the specimens are useless, others are OK.They are fine for elementary school projects but not for high school and clearly not for anything beyond that"
2,Broken into pieces,"Wonderful looking slides, all two of them considering that the other 23 slides were completely destroyed. The box does seem to be to big for something that is this fragile to be shipped in the mail. Would be better if purchased in the store where you can make sure they don't get destroyed."
2,Disclaimer: Second-hand opinion here,"This is SSI's Axis and Allies game engine redecorated with WH40k icons.With the creativity, zeal and technology today I would have thought Games Workshop would have something out by now that would be a real legacy to computer games. For this I dislike them. Dunno what their problem is but I hope they get it right sometime soon."
1,Humans are lizard food,"Zeta Reticuli, the home world of Dragons in the constellation Draco, near the North star Polaris. I looked through the eyes of the little gray alien at the foot of my bed and saw a ten foot tall lizard standing there. It looked at me and said ""humans taste like chicken"". No wonder our military attacks the spaceships whenever possible. Never give up armed forces! Defend the Second Amendment, it may be our only way to surviveTitled ""Destroy All Dreamers"".Freedom Fighters, protect our freedom, or we shall be their lunch!Biggus Jimmus, a proud human"
4,You don't want to read this book - so do,"Sarajevo Blues is poetry and prose of the war in Sarajevo. It is written with the realism that one associates with Ernaux or Duras. As the author says in an interview at the end of the book: ""We were completely attuned to the exterior world ... We had a real need for precision, with some belief that if we could put on paper precisely what was in the outside owrld that, in itself, would convey the emotional potential indispensable to poetry.""Thus this book makes its points simply - the cigarette wrapped in a death certificate, the recognition of the enemy in the same sweater that you wear, the pear eaten with the iman of the mosque ... the result is a book that will not permit you to view war in the abstract but rather forces you to look at war in the eyes of individual people who matter."
5,All-Clad Canister Set A Winner,"I agonized for almost a year prior to buying this canister set due to the cost and some of the negative reviews. I'm sorry I waited.These canisters are a perfect size. The largest holds a little more than a 5 lb. bag of flour; the smallest handles a 5 lb. bag of sugar. The lids are sealed. For those expecting the lids to just lift off, they aren't designed that way. For my purposes, it's ideal--I want to keep bugs and moisture out. The lids come off fairly easily by holding the canister and using the other hand to give the lid a slow, steady pull.I do notice that when I tried to fill the sugar to the brim, it couldn't seal properly and the sugar did clump up around the top in humid weather. I don't think it was a design flaw, I think it was my own fault for trying to fill it too full.The bottom line is are they worth the money and would I buy them again? Without a doubt. They're functional, look nice on the counter, and are made well."
5,Super looking canisters!,"I had wanted these canisters for a long time - being a big fan of All-Clad, and for a while they became very difficult to find. The only problem with them is that the lids are so tight - they are hard to open, but there is a plus side to that too because the contents are kept really fresh. Well worth it! They look great in the kitchen too!"
2,Air Tight!,"First the good: The are a good size, and they look beautiful. They match nearly everything in my kitchen.Now the bad: You need to work out in order to open them. Last night I needed to get into the flour to finish my dinner. I COULD NOT open the container. My dinner was burning so I turned everything off. I called my son (6 foot, strong, muscular). He struggled and finally got knives, utensils, and whatnot and pryed them open. Give me a break (so to speak). And I have instructed everybody in the family before NOT to put the lids on, just set them on loosely. No, I would not recommend this product."
5,A Few notes on this recording,"Since there is a paucity of information on this recording, I will try and help fill in the blanks.This is an album of performances recorded in 1989, issued in 1990 featuring American works by the duo-pianists Joshua Pierce and Dorothy Jonas.Track listings are as follows:Morton Gould: Dance Variations for Two Pianos & Orchestra (1953)1.

1,Rankin and Bass run out of steam.,"Out of all of the Rankin and Bass ""Animagic"" films, this one is definitely the worst (although ""The Life and Adventures Of Santa Claus"" and ""The Leprechaun's Gold"" run close second). Weak songs, weak story. It will make you pine for their glory days of ""Rudolph"" and ""The Year Without a Santa Claus""."
1,I Can't Believe It's From Rankin Bass!,"This was actually made by Rankin Bass who made the delightful Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, and Frosty The Snowman? This is as extremely bad as they are extremely good!"
1,Painfully Awful!,"Yikes! I love watching Christmas cartoons but I didn't love watching Pinocchio's Christmas, it was painfully bad and really lame and I can't believe it's a Rankin and Bass production. It Must have been an off day for them when they thought of this one! It's beyond tacky!"
2,Plot/Character Development?,"Overall, my students did not feel that this book really met their needs as readers. They struggled with relating to characters that were developed minimally. For example, Mai seems to jump back and forth between loving and hating Kien due to small actions on Kien's part. She forgives him quickly and returns to despising him pages later. There seems to be no feasible reason for this switching besides the contrived plot. Speaking of the plot, my students found it extremely predictable and a little sappy at the end. Overall, not a bad book for lower level readers, but do not expect to be thrilled by this story."
4,Good all around mustard,"An all around sweet and savory product to wake up any meal. I've use it on chicken breast, meatloaf, and sweet sausage, great to liven up a boring baked potato. Here is the best endorsement of a food product, would you buy it again, yes I would."
5,Great plug-in phones for every room!,"The At&T cordless expansion handset phones are very convenient to plug in anywhere in the house where a phone is needed--even the bathroom! Up to 8 phones can be used with the main base phone, an AT&T digital answering system, Model #EP5995, 5.8 GHz. What an absolute convenience!"
1,Bad sound quality,"I had an older AT&T; model cordless phone system that was excellent, so I decided to purchase this system for my business line. After buying the system with the answering maching and 1 additional headset, I realized it was a mistake. The sound quality on both phones is not as good as expected, and many times my clients tell me they can hear a crackle sound. The speaker phone is worthless as it will not allow me to speak because people on the other end hear every other word I say.Update...after trying several attempts to make this phone better, I replaced with a Panisonic and the sound quality is excellent. Also, battery life is much better."
1,Panasonic phones,"This phone system is utterly worthless. I only get caller ID with every other call or so. If the same person calls 5 times in a day, the caller ID display just says""incoming call"" (as if I didnt know that) I had a Panasonic cordless phone system that was about 5 yrs old and it still works great. All of the new Panasonic systems have this Caller Id problem."
5,THE ROCK SIDE OF JOSE FELICIANO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Excelente concierto de Feliciano en tierras Parisinas, en el se resume todo lo que es capaz de ejecutar un músico de su altura se pasea sin ningún problema por el pop, bolero, jazz, flamenco y sobre todo ROCK!!! Impresionantes covers de Santana, Jimi Hendrix y Eric Clapton definitivamente inusual ver a Feliciando aplicando técnicas como el pedal steel WAH WAH!! Espero que se pueda editar algún CD con este material.....ESTE ES EL VERDADERO JOSE FELICIANO UN MÚSICO DE CALIDAD MUNDIAL!!!!"
5,"Really, really, good.","A must see. Except for, in my opinion his ""crazy heart"" number, I loved it! Completely engulfed me and brought back loads of memories. Starts out with Chico and the Man, includes a cool rendition of Billy Jean, with some hard rock stuff. Such versatility! he's an odd performer in that he gives little facial or body expression of movement. Finger work is the ""working man's"" style and it is quite stunning how fast he can go."
1,too bad to review,"There is nothing to say about this concert.Poor performance, bad quality sound, plain, boring ""concert"".One must wonder, - why this concert even produced on blue -ray.You must be a very dedicated fan to survive to the end.Mediocre, - is a compliment."
5,a great romance unfolds,"I enjoyed reading this book. The characters in this book are everyday people you can relate to, therefore it is easier to follow and more enjoyable. The situations that arise are interesting and after each chapter it leaves you hanging, wanting to go on to the next chapter. I couldn't put the book down, after every chapter, I thought to myself I must go to sleep and I will finish tomorrow, but that was unacceptable. I had to know what was next, was it exciting. I found myself trying to predict the outcome, and I felt as if the people in the book were part of my everyday life, I found myself talking out loud, as if I were a character in the book giving my advice. It is a great book and an excellent buy."
4,Gas only,"The book has several diagrams and specifics for a variety of outdoor fireplaces, all of which are designed for ""gas"". Wood burning fireplaces requirements are not included basically limiting this publication to a few useful ideas and perhaps a good start on a comprhensive materials list."
2,"Beehives, Barbeques,fireplaces and more","Its a nice book but, it a little shallow in the real gritty aspect of how to do, focused on the authors pretty western outdoor entertainment area. If your looking to make a simple oven and design you might pass on this one"
2,disappointed,the book had some good basic project information and project consideration in it but literally fell apart as I was reading it for the first time. Not nearly as helpful as it was made out to be.
1,Misleading Advertising,"Please seriously consider before buying the LED version of the Itty Bitty book light (model 10056) that you cannot replace the light bulbs. The product description gives you the impression that the bulbs will last for 10 years. Our experience is that they do not last that long and that once one of the bulbs burns out you might as well throw the book light out. When I notified customer service that one of my bulbs had burned out, they told me that there was no guarantee on the bulbs and that I had to buy a new one. I will tell you that we did not have the book light anywhere near 10 years. So please keep this in mind before buying this book light."
2,"Zelco's ""itty bitty"" is a bitty too brighty","This small book light does everything it says it will. Unfortunately it does quite a bit more than that. The light source comes from two LEDs which emit about twice as much light as my wife's incandescent bedside table lamp does. One major selling point of a book light is that a person can stay up in bed reading while that person's bedmate sleeps without the distraction of light in their face. Unfortunately, this light brings a gun to the knife fight and renders itself pointless for our needs."
4,"Works well, quality is a bit flimsy","This book light uses white LEDs to light the page, which is bright, but not glaring to my eyes. Some people don't like the LED light, but I personally find it easier on my eyes. The book light is small, and the steel clip holds well on even a pocketbook.The unit operates on 4 AAA batteries, and when you install them you find the only problem I have with the unit-- it isn't designed very well-- the batteries tend to pop out until you get the cover on and locked down. Other than that, I recommend this light.Note that the one I have has a rectangular shade on it, while the one pictured above is round-- I don't know if there is any functional difference between the two-- mine *is* slimmer than the one shown."
2,Light was ok while it lasted,"Been through about 4 book lights in the last 6 months trying to find a good one, this one seemed like a keeper as it lasted a month longer than all the rest, but... it wasn't meant to me.1) it has 2 LED's, within a month 1 of them died, not a big deal 1 was plenty bright, infact I kind of liked it a little more at 1/2 brightness, easier to read in total darkness.2) the head doesn't swivel at all, on big books the page on the far side isn't that bright, maybe if I had 2 leds...3) after about 2 months of use (all this on the first set of batteries, so kudos's there) the last remaining LED started to flicker and I had to throw it away.All this was w/o any traveling or abuse, it pretty much got clipped to book and went from my nightstand beside my bed into my hands, and back when I was done reading for the night."
3,Too bright!,"This product definitely illuminates the book you want to read, but the bulbs are so bright that it illuminates half the room, too. Not good if you bought the light so your husband could sleep!"
2,did not work smoothly,The clip on the book light did not clip strongly. The button to turn the light on and off did not work smoothly. The light was dim and blue colored. The light bulb did not work long. I do not see a way to change batteries.
2,Not a good as I'd hoped.,The light output of this device is inadequate for reading at night. It would have been better with three for four LEDs.
2,LED's aren't supposed to burn out...,"I have had my book light for about a week, and one of my bulbs flickered and went out. It worked the next time I turned it on, but I fear it isn't going to be long before it goes out all together. Also, the warranty doesn't cover LEDs. Other than that, the light seems perfect."
1,Also Disappointed - Product Failure,"I purchased the Zelco LED booklight about 2-3 months ago. It was nice and bright, lightweight, very handy. Last week when I plugged it in, it burned out with no warning, just a bright flash and ""that's all she wrote."" Also, if you put batteries in the booklight, make sure it is also not plugged into the adapter, I had done this and the batteries started to corrode after a couple of days. From other reviews and my own experience, it looks like Zelco needs to redesign this product. I am a disappointed consumer."
2,Product failure,One LED failed after less than 100 hours use. Item is compact and looks well designed but quality control seems lacking. It is unforgiveable that a lioghtemitting diode should fail in so short a time.
2,good for one year only,"This worked great for 1 year, but then it died for unknown reasons (I even took it apart and played with the wires a bit). If it had cost $5-10, I wouldn't mind, but for $30, I think I should get at least a few years of use out of it. When it works, it's great though."
1,Returned Zelco light 3 times-still bad,"I bought the LED light and AC adapter in October of 2005. In June of 2006 I returned it because one of the two LEDs went out. Amazon warranty is only good for 30 days. Sent it to Zelco and they replaced it. A few months later the same thing happened and I again sent it to Zelco for replacement-they did. Then again! Just the other evening the ""10 year"" LED failed once more. Four times in two years! I give up. The reason I bought it in the first place was so I don't have to constantly change bulbs in the incandescent version. If you purchase this light be sure to save your receipt and set aside some postage!"
1,Terrible product,Having owned and loved the original itty bitty book light I purchased this model with the adapter with no hesitation. What a disappointment. The first one arrived and I had to send it back immediately as it just plain did not work. The second one arrived and worked fine for a couple of months and now the light flickers constantly. Tell me that isn't irritating. Don't waste your money on this product.
5,The Dead Celebrity Status album,This is a awsome cd i think anyone who likes music will like this album. I ecspecially like the song We Fall We Fall.
5,So good words fail me.,"There is so much music out there with no real soul. It is even a stretch to call it music. Here is a little bit of a shock to reality; music that is fresh and alive. It's rap mixed with singing, but not your typical rap with a few dischordant notes playing the whole time. There are some very nice harmonies in this CD, with a very eastern feel to the music. The lyrics are original and full of feeling and emotion, especially 'If These Walls Could Talk', number seven on the CD. A must listen. These guys are on the way up."
5,Amazing,this cd is amazing. The boys have some lyrical talent. Words can't even describe how amazing this cd is!I suggest everyone out there purchase this cd. You won't be disappointed.
2,"Travel guide, not a useful wine guide.",The title misleads. The book is a travelog of the adventures of the author. I have some personal knowledge of the region and have had similar experiences to those of the author-the book will be useful to a traveler as a planning tool. It does not contribute to the knowledge base on Rioja wines.
5,Things you didn't know about WW11,who knew the Brits didn't want D-Day to happen. Who knew about the double agents and spy networks. who knew about the German soldiers working against Hitler? I didn't and now I do. This book is fascinating and informative.
4,A good hymnal,"A good sampling of hymns from the American Episcopalian church. Some of the settings seem to be archaic just for the sake of including plainsong instead of singable tunes, but the texts tend to be good."
2,They squandered their chance to make a great Hymnal better!,"This is a terrible Hymnal. The type is thin and difficult to read, and they start one hymn on the same page where another finishes rather than starting each hymn on it's own page. They've made the words *Gender-Neutral* (i.e. ""Good Christian Friends Rejoice"") and needlessly changed the wording on several hymns to make them more Politically Correct.The group that compiled this sorry excuse for a Christian Hymnal had a wonderful opportunity to make the superb 1940 Episcopal Hymnal even better than it already was. Indeed, they did add a couple of good new hymns, but they also deleted far too many excellent hymns from the 1940 Hymnal.All in all, it was a dismal collaborative effort by non-musical, politically-driven cretins. It is still in use by most Episcopal congregations today, perhaps partially explaining the disarray the Church finds itself in today."
3,Attention Women,"I don't normally buy things like this online, but I really didn't see a difference between that and getting something at the store. I took a chance on it. It isn't as thick as it seems, but it cleanses fabously. I was concerned, because the package looked like it was old, like it was sitting there forever, but the stuff inside seemed to work great. It is like rubbing watery dirt over your face. It you are young, you won't need the toner, and you might not need a moisterizer if your skin is oily. It cleanses your poors while setting oils in your skin. I tried washing my face with warm water before applying it, than I rinsed with cold. That gave me the best results. Warm water helps bring out the oils, and the cold water washes them away, so my suggestion for all you women is to think about that. because this product moiserizes and cleanses, it is ideal for you to consider your skin type. Try it out with different approaches."
4,Home to Italy,"A sweet story about going home. From America back to the land of his birth - Aburzzo, Italy - the land of his birth. A story of old ties and new beginnings. It is a quick read without any dark twists (at least none that are not visable early in the read). You can see the ending coming, but that's okay - because it is such a joy! In addtion, the story is illistrative for non-Itatians as the book gets the Aburzzi-Italian spot on! At least this Aburzzian thinks so!"
1,"trite, very trite","Utterly predictable, poorly written. The author loves to use the word for in all kinds of weird places, probably because he thinks it sounds highly literate. No character development at all. All you need is love.... Yuck!"
4,Like listening to my hometown neighbors!,"I really enjoyed this gentle story of Peppi's renewed life. The description of scents and sights described Italy so well that I could visualize it. The conversations very aptly reminded me of the Italians in my hometown who could squabble about everything yet deeply care about their friends. It is not a story with lots of action or surprises but a delightful, heartwarming tale of friendship and life after loss of a loved one. I'd like to find more by this author."
1,Not worth the time,"If you enjoy good literature give this one a pass. This book is trite, boring, predicatable and cliche. There is nothing new or noteworthy about Mr. Pezzeli's prose. Striclty dullsville."
2,A little creeped out...,"I loved the beginning of this novel. The author was successful in conveying a strong sense of loss and the urge to 'go home' to reclaim an old part of yourself. But then this May/December romance blossoms....It, sadly, left me feeling more than a bit creeped out."
1,Disappointing,"As someone who loves all things Italian, I was expecting to love this book. Unfortunately, the plot doesn't hang together (the main character and his best friend, who haven't communicated in decades, immediately stumble across each other and recognize each other? Yeah right!). The characters are generally not likeable, especially the main character's love interest. And the romance is quite unlikely and kind of icky."
1,A waste....,"...of my time and money. I hate to give a bad review, but felt compelled to do so in my hope to help another to avoid the mistake that I did in purchasing this book. This story was so juvenile, uninteresting and predictable. It was just so disappointing. Do not buy it or you will be sorry."
1,Wake me when it's over,"Someone's got to tell the truth about this cliche novel to spare readers utter boredom and book shelf clutter. If you're thinking Peter Mayle, forget it. Peter Pezzelli's style mirrors a sophisticated middle schooler in terms of character development and use of simile. Both are simple and spare in the most unelegant way. From the beginning of the novel to the end, one would be hard pressed to manufacture true pathos for a man who buries his infertile wife of 45 years (the love of his life, we are told), moves to his homeland of Italy, marries the sassy daughter of his best friend who bears him a son, and lives happily ever after. The plot is predictable and b-o-r-i-n-g!"
2,Amateurish Effort,"This first novel, sadly, reads like one. The prose is so lacking in polish that I really thought I was reading the work of a high schooler. As far as the story....predictable and rather hard to believe. Please note: I love Italy and cycling, so I thought this would be right up my alley, but, among the many, many books written by Americans who try to capture the essential essence of Europe, this one fails to satisfy. Just one man's opinion."
4,Cycling romance,"Romantic and touching. My husband was into cycling, so I could relate, but couldn't really imagine I'd like a book about it when I realized this was where we'd go. However, there was just enough of cycling, religion, cooking and Italian life to make this an enjoyable read. Some parts were a little far-fetched - but not the parts about friends meeting after 40 years, or a potential match between 40s and late 50s-early 60s. It's a short book, and a good read in between fantasies, vampires, and hard-boiled detective stories. I thought the characters were interesting, believable, and charming. I didn't mind the easy-going, simple style of writing, but some who know Italian thought those phrases were poorly written. I passed over them easily enough, and I didn't even realize it was in the ""religious"" category until I returned to leave a review."
3,Carlos Santana: Back on Top,"As a Santana fanatic, I found this book extremely dissapointing. Major chunks are lifted directly out of older material. In addition, there were some major factual errors. One of them that set off an immediate Red Flag was Shapiro naming Fred Catero as ""Fred Castro"". Catero was the Sound Engineer and was responsible for the phenomenal sound of Abraxas.Also, the author basically copied an excellent article from Ben Fong-Torres--formerly with Rolling Stone--word for word.To get the same exact information provided in this book is to simply Google Carlos Santana wiki as well as Ben Fong Torres, archived information.An EXCELLENT book I would recommend is ""Voices of Latin Rock,"" by Jim McCarthy. This book contains original photos, interviews with original Santana band members, including their extended families. There is much more information gleaned out of this last book and well worth the $10.00. Save your money and don't buy Shapiro's book."
2,Enthusiastically Wrong,"The pros are that the book is easy to read and the author writes with enthusiasm. The main issue I had with the book is that the author gets some of the dates of events in Carlos Santana's life wrong. Most people would not mind such inaccuracies, but I do. The lack of research and interest in getting it right lacks professionalism and distorts history. I would instead recommend checking out Leng or Slavicek if you want more meat or just the facts about Carlos Santana."
1,waste of time,I never recieved this book. After spending time trying to order the book it was not available. The only reason I became interested in it was because of a promotion amazon ran when I was trying to order another book. Please don't waste my time in the future.
5,Changed my life!,"The Bible (Jesus) opened my heart...and this book opened my eyes!I knew I had a longing to give, and did so at most opportunities, but now I know why.I thank the Lord for using Robert Morris. We've bought and distributed this book to numerous people...I hope it has made a difference in their lives as well."
3,Just OK,The content is good but very redundant. Some of the chapters have a TV evangelist feel to it. We are using it for a weekly men's group but are having some difficulty because he says the same thing just in different ways.
1,Great,"Excellent book. I would suggest it to any church or ministry. It will help you, your ministry and your family."
5,The Blessed Life,This book has been a real blessing in my life and bought it from a great seller. May you be blessed.
5,Changed my life!,"Reading this book has changed my life. Never before did I understand the true meaning of the tithe. Applying the principles outlined in this book has not only changed my financial situation, but has blessed my marriage. I grew up in church and I have never heard the principles of tithe and offerings like this. I love this book!"
5,Advanced Christian Stewardship,"This is an excellent biblically-based book for every person seeking to learn more about the purpose of giving in the church. I like it because it is focused on God's will for our finances, and the attitude we must have in order for our givings to be acceptable unto Him. This is for those who would like to have their faith increased to new levels in believing God to supply every need. This book has given me a more intimate relationship with God, because God has taken me to another level in renewing my mind. A must read for every believer!"
1,Not so good,Having trouble reconciling this author's notion of tithing with modern direct deposit. Whole groups who are independent business operators or sole proprietors are left without cogent instruction. For new christians he offers confusion and frustration. Hopefully they will have a mature christian to help with the inconsistencies.
2,Not believable,"Interesting book about THE HOLY SPIRIT, I think there are better books on the subject, Bible has lots of stories,"
2,"""Swallow it Whole""?","My husband and I weren't sure whether this book, recommended for reading by our elders to the whole congregation, was a ""swallow it whole"" situation or a ""chew up the meat and spit out the bones""-type read. After chapters 2-4, we found it an exciting and inspirational look at Holy Spirit-led giving; however, Pastor Morris' insistence on a legalistic ""tithing"" being the base for Christian giving spoils the whole message. Like most tithing teachers, he takes Bible verses out of context, ""reads into"" verses and events, and omits relevant passages in order to create support for his doctrine. I am grieved that new Christians are going to have their consciences oppressed by some of the concepts and instructions in this book. Please be like the Bereans and ""examine the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things are so"". (Acts 17:11)"
1,Just not right,"First off, I consider myself a Christian and follower of Christ. And i can see the concept of tithing having a strong point through the bible. But what really steamed me up, is in this current state of the economy with people out of work and people losing their homes to have Mr Morris preach that if you don't give 10% then you are cursed. How dare you sir. Besides it's not like the money would go straight to God, it would go to Church's like his. If you are going to go deep and back into the old testament to bring up references then also remember Gods command for the altar and how a house of worship should be. A stage with projectors and multimedia is not what Jesus had in mind. The church of Jesus and the disciples was much like the Orthodox church, the 'original' church and there you don't hear them asking you to tithe 10% of what you don't have, let alone saying you are cursed if you don't."
5,Pure Excellence,"This book is the most excellent,well written book I have ever read on this subject!!! It is line upon line truth from God's word and full of the love of God. I could not put this book down until I was done reading it. I highly recommend this book,but also highly recommend you practice the principles contained in it."
1,too much out of context teaching,"As I have seen, read, and heard before, there is a lot of idealism and subjectivity offered with a scripture or passage of scriptures -- taught out of the context from the original meaning defined by the definitions surrounding the scripture s - eliminating the true purpose of the lesson and the real meaning to its original audience. Just a bunch of religious testimonial dreams, fantasies, and mystical blessings. God does bless and will bless his people - but too many have these far fetch testimonies to get people to give more money. What a shame!Please go back to study these scriptures without already having these preconceived notions -- get you a bible dictionary and lexicon -- then go back and study the meanings. There is a huge habit in ministry where people add their own meanings into the context of the scriptures. If that's what you like, then this book is suited for your taste. No harm, but the naked truth has just been clothed."
5,Good quality EGR guide pipe tube gasket!,"Good quality (metallic looking) EGR 'guide pipe/tube' gasket (one of the two gaskets used on EGR 'guide pipe/tube' - both gaskets are different, think this is the lower one). Keep in mind this is not the gasket for EGR 'valve' which is different (which resembles cardboard, not metallic-looking). Also a good price at amazon. Hope this helps somebody since the EGR job on a 1999 Maxima as such is a difficult & hard to get to job, & this avoids some confusion!"
1,Not recommended,"I can't even believe this product is on the market. Not only is it impossible to get an even tan without spreading with your hands, the CO2 cartridge freezes up and is unusable within only a minute. I followed the manufacturers tips stating that you need to let it rest and it will unfreeze...it did not. So I placed another cartridge in and began using for 30 seconds before it froze and became unusable.Another point is that you have to hold the unit upright at all times or else the fluid spills out. How is that consumer friendly? How do you do do your back?Please note that you cannot return this item. I it threw away in disgust. Did I mention that you need to be in a fully sheeted room as the stuff goes everywhere and stains!I do not recommend buying this product."
1,I agree!!,"Product is not made well. Had to sendd back to get new piece, and then it worked for 20 seconds. Trash"
2,no magic portion,"I TRULY EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS PRODUCT (IT CERTAINLY IS NOT CHEAP), I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS AND SO FAR NO IMPROVEMENT, MY NAILS ARE STILL SPLITTING,SLOW GROWING AND BREAKING. MAYBE ON OTHER PEOPLE IT WORKS BETTER, ON ME CERTAINLY NO MIRACLES."
3,not the same as before,Does not stay as well as the previous bottle did and think if the ingredients are the same it should.
4,stimulates growth,"I was having a problem with peeling and slow growing nails. I do believe that the Qtica has stimulated some growth, however it does peel a bit and I must reapply often."
4,An Excellent Sourcebook,"This book provides a wide range of Taoist material, ranging through philosophy, salvational religion, mysicism of a variety of kinds, etc. It gives a reader an excellent exposure to a variety of types of literature that have been produced in the Taoist traditon. Like most such anthology/sourcebooks it suffers a little bit from a lack of analysis and background information. This lack makes some of the materials presented difficult to understand for readers who lack a solid background in Taoism as a religion (i.e. not merely the Tao Te Ching). Still, by reveaing in a very direct manner the breadth and depth of the Taoist tradition, the book does fulfill its purpose. At all events, anyone interested in Taoism will find it interesting to read the selections."
4,Comfort food from Grandma's day,"A compilation of county fair winners in such categories as Pickles, Preserves, Meats, Breads, Cakes and more. If you were wishing you had Grandma's recipe for Watermelon Pickles, homemade catsup, or Green Tomato Mincemeat, this could be your book. Rhubarb Marmalade? Squash Preserves? It's here. Like donuts? Mrs. Elsie Martin of Linden, TN used mashed potatoes in her prize-winning recipe. Maybe you'd prefer the more traditional glazed donut from Mrs. Harold Tweedie of Walton, NY. The judges must have had a good time judging Merle McDaniels' Beef Pie, Carol Scheer's Chicken-Fried Liver and Peggy Barr's Lemon Beefies. And don't get me started on the DESSERTS! Proceed with caution and look through the Cakes section at your own risk. (Don't say I didn't warn you!)"
3,suncutter rear window shade,The name says it all. It functions like it is supposed too. Covers most of the glass. Difficult to see out of at night though. I would recommend it if you have small children and are looking for shade options.
1,Blocks very little sun,"I bought this because my 10-month old cries when the sun comes in through our rear window and gets in his eyes. (He is still too young to sit in a forward-facing car seat.) It doesn't seem to make a difference at all, however, and I'm still stuck riding in the back seat, blocking the sun by holding up the car seat manual."
4,"finally, something that works!","After buying and returning two different items, I finally found one that works! This actually stays on my rear window, while the other ones would simply fall off. It serves its purpose well, to shade the sun. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't look that great and does obscure my view a bit, but not enough to make driving unsafe."
3,Not bad,"One little plastic piece that held a suciton cup in broke. Now one suction cup is floating around my car somewhere. Maybe I tried to get it off my window the wrong way, but it gave pretty easily to breaking.The other suciton cups stuck for a bit, but one really hot day, they gave in. At least I can still use the product with it only missing one suction cup. I still like the product, because it keeps the sun out of my little guys eyes. So that's good! I'd probably buy it again, because I like the cover, and the 4 little suciton cups that aren't in my way. I would just be extremely careful with the suction cups."
1,does not stay on window,I purchased this the end of June to shade my daughter's eyes in her rear facing car seat. It is worthless because the suction cups don't stay on the window. I must have tried re-sticking up in my rear window at least 15-10 in a two hour period. It just would not stay put. What good is a window shade that wont stay on the window. I deeply regret this purchase.
2,"Sorry, Ms Phillips, this book of yours is not worth buying!","This is a little better than Honey Moon but based on the various SEP books I have read so far, the interesting ones are Nobody Baby's but Mine, Kiss an Angel, and Nobody but You. Other than that, Miss SEP is giving too much psychological hangup for her characters... Please stop playing shrink and do not print another book unless it is your best!"
1,Lady be good,"THIS BOOK SUCKED!!! Emma is so stupid and naive. She humiliates herself so many times I can't even count. And the hero, Kenny, is content to just sit there and laugh at her. Sometimes I just wanted to smack her to make so many assumptions on people's character even though there are clues right in front of her face that says she is worng."
3,Not quite up to par...,"I have read all of SEP's books, thus far. This one was probably my least favorite. I found it difficult to relate to the characters, they just weren't endearing. And the constant complaint that Lady E was too bossy became a very tired complaint thoughout this tale. I prefer Susan's more jovial characters, like Daisy in ""Honey Moon"" or any of the characters in ""It Had to be You."" While I enjoy Susan's style of writing, this book just didn't do it for me."
5,"Excellent, without out a doubt!","I loved this book. I usually cannot say that about a book because there are always things in it that bother me. But I can honestly say that ""Lady Be Good"" was one of the best books I have EVER read. It was one of those books where you're sitting on the couch and laughing so hard that your family worries about your sanity. Seriously, this book is so well written and does a very good job of catching human emotions and insecurities and throwing them together with a rich, unique and rather wicked type of humour. I cannot find a single flaw in it. Excellent, without a doubt!"
4,Lively and a bit of seduction,"well this book follows the common to SEP scheme: 30 yo spunky virgin meet a boor millionaire playboy and the romance, marriage and pregnancy ensues. (btw only 2% of americans over 25 are virgins ))Despite the predictable yet unrealistic plot, its the dialogue that wins in this book as in others by SEP. It flirty and lively and even though I would not go back and reread as Wilde's, its still very indulgently enjoyable.I think in this particular book the male hero is given a chance to be a bit more creative than usually, as he's on a mission to seduce as opposed to some others in SEP's who start relationships on a spur of a moment."
4,Funny!,"I finished this book last night and I am still chuckling this morning. This is a really fun book. Kenny is a golfer who is having a little bad luck in his career. To get back into the ""swing"" of things, so to speak, Kenny has agreed to act as tour guide for Lady Emma. Emma is an English headmistress of an all girls school in London. It took me about 2-3 chapters before I really started to get into this romance, but when things take off, they really go. The love scenes were hot and the romance was sweet. Not only were the H/H fun to watch, but the secondary characters were great too. Just when I thought I had seen everything, Kenny/Emma would say or DO something so outrageous, that I just had to crack up! The dialogue caught me by surprise so many times, that I have go back and read it again to see if I missed anything."
3,Not the best I've read by Susan Elizabeth Phillips,"Not the best book I've ready by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. My first book by her was ""Ain't She Sweet"" and I have read that book at least 3 times and love it more each time. ""This Heart of Mine"" was also amazing but this book kind of fell flat for me, I guess because I couldn't truly relate to the heroin. On a positive note-it was well written with no grammatical errors (which drive me crazy on most e-books)."
4,Definitely worth your time!,"This is the first novel of SEP's i've read and she is now one of my favorite authors. ""Lady Be Good"" is a must read novel. I was in stitches reading this book. This is one hilarious story."
5,"Fun, Funny, Sexy, and Excellent!","Phillip's latest is also one of her best. She introduces fun, fascinating new characters, and reintroduces some long-ago (and sorely missed) ones. It's wonderful to see how they've changed, and how they relate to Lady Emma and Kenny, and his wonderful sister Torie. The Travelers are a great new family, and it was nice to catch up on the Beaudines, too! SEP's mix of romance and fun hits the spot. I wish she had a hundred books!"
2,Just Okay...Hard to Finish,"The plot was weak...and the chemistry was off not by a whole lot but enough to make you feel like you don't need to stick around and finish the book! ""It Had to Be You"" is much better."
5,Lady Be Good-It is!,"Let me just say, I'm very glad I gave SEP a second chance. Although I did not enjoy Fancy Pants I loved Lady Be Good. I like the sub-plot romances she has in her books (well the two I've read). I hope one day we'll get to read about Ted."
5,One of my favourites!,"This is one of my favourite SEP's books. Lady Emma is sweet and innocent, yet at the same time determined and passionate about the things she care for. Kenny is exactly what she needs, a man who can protect her, make her laugh and enjoy herself. This book makes me laugh out loud with their witty banter and playfulness."
5,Absolutely Hilarious,"I know this isn't the most famous of SEP's books but in my opinion it's by far the funniest. And that's saying a lot because anything she writes is full of wit.Lady Emma is a British schoolmistress, straight-laced as they come. The new owner of the school is trying to blackmail her into marriage so she tries to get out of it the only way she can think of- to destroy her reputation. He won't take no for an answer, but he won't marry someone with a bad reputation. Emma is rather creative in the extremes to which she'll go to ruin her good reputation.Kenny Traveler has been in trouble one too many times and finds himself suspended from professional golf. Dallie, the bad boy from Fancy Pants, has cleaned up his act and is now acting commissioner of the PGA. He and Francine are delightful annoyances in this book, Dallie trying to get Kenny to grow up and Francine trying to be a matchmaker. Their son, Teddy, is fully grown now and steals the show. I hope he gets his own book some day!"
5,"Delightful, funny, sexy, emotional....Classic SEP!","I can't believe she did it again! She keepes getting better and better. I love her other books sooo much (especially her beloved Chicago Stars series). I did not think she could possibly beat them. She did - this is my favorite SEP book. Kenny is good enough to eat, ladies. And Emma is hilarious. They are true opposites, but perfect together. Please read this book for the hot tub scene alone. RUN to your local bookstore and buy yourselves a copy of this book. It is simply delightful. I could NOT put it down (and believe me, I usually have a very short attention span!). Happy reading! This book is one of my favorites of all time!"
1,This book was terrible,I hated the 2 main characters. She was an idiot and he took too much moronic behavior from her. Terrible compared to her other books.
3,I usually DEVOUR SEP's work...,"but this one took me nearly a week to complete. What a let down. A well written story, but it contained NONE of the heat, sexual tension, and laugh out loud humor of ""Heaven, Texas"" and ""Dream A Little Dream"" (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND both stories).The heroine annoyed me. I had no idea what Kenny saw in her. It was a chore finishing this book. I got the sense that Ms. Phillips forced herself to complete a story that had lost interest for her because she was on deadline and under contract. Well, I'm going to look for some of her earlier works and chalk this one up to burn out."
1,Lady Be Gone...,"I am so exasperrated as I listen to this audiobook. New to SEP books, I was so over-taken by 'Match Me If You Can' which is a more recent SEP book. I listened to it 3x in one week. The writing was clear and the characters as well as the story flowed seamlessly. Needless to say I was ready for another SEP novel. Unfortunately, Lady Be Good did not prove to be a winner. I cannot stand Lady Emma. Her character is so annoying and I find myself not pulling for her at all. My sheer determination not be a quitter will be the only reason I don't set aside this book. I must admit SEP has majorly improved on her storylines, dialogue and character development."
5,What a kick!!,This is a wonderful book. Loaded with character. This is one of the few (maybe only one) books I have read (uncountable number) that has sizzling love scenes and also made me laugh out loud. Good read.
4,Witty and Fun,"Another winner from SEP. This book is witty and fun, an all-together playful romp. Not as complex or rich as some of her other novels (Dream A Little Dream in particular), but still a very good read."
3,Not up to SEPs very high standards,"I'm a BIG SEP fan, but haven't responded this way to one of her books since HONEY MOON. Susan just wasn't ""present"" for me in LADY, I found myself not liking Lady Emma, or supporting character Tori; usually SEPs women are my favorite people. I will say that LADY was better the second time I read it (also like HONEY MOON), but for an author I usually give 5 stars, this was a let down."
2,Not nearly as good as her other books...,"I have read most of SEP's books and I loved them, especially Nobody's Baby but Mine and Dream a Little Dream. But I found this book did not even come close to her earlier books. While some parts where funny, for the most part I thought the book was a drag. And Emma's character did not interest me much. I prefered the characters of Tori and Dex than to the main characters! Overall, not as good as her earlier reads. If you really want to read some of Susan Elizabeth Phillips best works try those!"
4,Buy It!!!!,"If you like SEP, this book is a must have, if you've never read her books before, then after reading this one you'll be looking for all her other books. I loved this book, the characters were well developed and it was hilarious."
1,"Love SEP, But Not This Book","I was on a SEP roll there for a while ... Nobody's Baby but Mine, Match Me If You Can, and (quite possibly my favorite book ever), Ain't See Sweet? But this book was a big disappointment for me. I found myself not only putting it down a lot (very unlike the previous SEP books), but never really wanting to pick it up again. After the first half of the book or so, I gave up. The hero was all right, reminded of the Kenny Chesney type. But the heroine bugged me. A LOT. I read plenty of regency romances, so the fact that she was British didn't bother me. Just about everything else did, though. Brisk, bossy, and overbearing with absolutely no redeeming qualities that I could see. I found myself not enjoying reading about her. Also very important is that there was virtually no chemistry between these two. Even the tit for tat seemed flat and unsatisfying. I cannot recommend this book. Sorry."
5,Another classic from Susan Elizabeth Phillips,"I loved this book for so many different reasons that it's difficult to narrow it down to a few: the reversal of the gender roles, the great supporting cast, the terrific family dynamics . . . and oh, yeah, the ROMANCE. Great, great stuff."
2,poor quality,My daughter got this for Christmas and loved it. Loved it so much that her arm broke off in a week. At first it popped back on but no more. It's also hard for my daughter to spin her. My daughter does love to sing along with her.
4,Sennheiser OMX50 Street Line Flexible Stereo Clip-On Earphones,"I am very pleased with the sound from these headsets, and am pleased it has the online volume control. The earclip and bud combo is comfortable and allows for some adjustments so you can fit it to your ear well. I am glad I purchased this headset. The reason I gave it a 4 out 5 is because of the cord. It's thin and tangles easy. I have a concern it could snap. Also, for my useage, the cord is a bit short. So, I purchased an extension cord from Amazon and it works well. I connect it to my laptop/PC so I can listen to internet radio."
3,You can do better,"Pros: Good sound, in line volume controlCons: In-line volume control sucks, design sucks, array of different ear covers not includedLong story short: product described is not product shipped, the stupid around the back of your neck design for the right earbud is ridiculous and pointless, the in-line volume control does not give nearly the control over sound as other models of Sennheiser headphones. The sound is good, as expected from this company, but the design is awful. Get something else."
4,pretty decent,"great sound and more comfy than ear buds that go in yer ears..lol one problem i have is one of the two sets i purchased, one cord is longer... alot longer than the other side.. so i had to roll it up and tie it with a wire tie.. it doesnt affect the sound or feel but it looks funny..*****EDIT*****Ok so now I understand why the longer cord on one side, lol, I guess its so you can run the wire around the back of your head so its not hanging down in front of you getting in the way and caught up in what ever it is your doing... I wish they would tell us old farts who are used to wearing real head phones and not ear buds and stuff.."
3,Sennheiser OMX50 vs. Sony MDR-J10,"I just got the OMX50's and, having used the Sony MDR-J10 previously, I'm a little disappointed with the sound quality. There is a significant difference in price so I hope the woman who sold them to me is correct in saying the OMX50's will last longer than the Sony MDR-J10's.The volume control is a nice feature considering I do not level my mp3s and my device does not seem to either.The fit is ok, however I have not used them on the treadmill yet.The asymmetrical wires are a bit distracting right now, as I'm trying to figure out how this is, ""more comfortable"".Overall I think they are ok. Before more use I cannot justify paying much more for them over the Sony MDR-J10 based on sound quality.{2-days later} They failed the treadmill test, so I'm exchanging them for the Sony's. I guess even if the Sony's don't last very long you can't go wrong for 10 bucks."
3,"Decent Headphones, but does not fit my ear...","The sound quality is decent, however the earphones do not fit my ear. I advise people with small kernels to not purchase this item, or you'll be spending a lot of time with your hands trying to adjust these earphones in to your ears..."
3,Great except for........,"I purchased these based on the fact that regular buds don't stay put in my ears, especially during movement. These are very comfortable and very stylish looking. The inline volume adjuster is nice. But...the one thing that disappointed me was the bass. Or lack thereof. Dynamic bass response is what it cliams on the package. Not. Overall, except for that, they are really good."
5,My Thinking is Clarified About Many Things,"When I saw a review below written by someone who could only name call instead of providing any substanative critique, I suspected this book was probably very Good, Insightful, and Truthful.After reading Disabling America, my suspicions were confirmed. This book is a must-read, ESPECIALLY if you are not disabled. *But what REALLY surprised me was the constant HUMOR in a book that most people might think would be dry. The text was enjoyable and to make that happen, the author has to be extremely skilled.Greg Perry shows how the government fosters discrimination against the disabled. He does this with precision. But he also exposes problems with many of the Left's sacred cows. I read a lot of liberal AND conservative titles. I prefer the conservative ones that tell truth. Perry does this better than ANYbody I've read since Walter Williams."
4,Life Out On The Road -- A Jazz Journey,"What a wonderful discovery for anyone who wants a primer on the bass in jazz! Mr. Leonhart also writes the music/lyrics here, and has an affable vocal approach as well...He is witty and intelligent. Biographical (""Me 'N' Lenny"", ""Louis Bellson""), bluesy (""Rain""), and just plain fun (""Iguanas and Lizards"", ""Change My Occupation""), he has class accompanyment in his fellow players and is simply one of those thirty-year/overnight wonders. I'm a big fan."
4,Very helpful,This is a great book for anyone looking to improve their presentation and communication skills.
1,Didn't finish it!,"While some stories were interesting to listen to; there just wasn't enough substance to the (audio)book. I didn't finish listening to it, and unless this is your first book on leadership, I would recommend against it.More could be gotten from a public speaking book and a few leadership books (Tom Peters is my latest read who is pretty good).Mike"
1,No substantial information,"The book was a huge disappointment. The tips in the book were not only surface level but also incredibly basic. The author is obviously right leaning as well as she celebrated McCain, Romney, and the Bush administration multiple times and took stabs at the democrats. This reads like a book that was written over the weekend to be an expensive business card to get speaking gigs. Don't waste your time or money here."
5,helpful,I liked the practical suggestions given. They are offered clearly and one is able to practice them immediately. Fantastic and informative
1,This one goes to the used cd shop ... second-rate recordings,"Sorry to burst the bubble of this recording label, but quite a few tracks are live, and end abruptly with annoyingly loud and quickly muted applause. Can't recordings not from a studio be labelled as 'live' or 'studio and live recordings'? One track ends abruptly with applause and the muffled voice of an announcer is heard - where was the recording engineer???This is a great concept series - fresh, updated packaging of classic vocals, and a compilation of 2 CDs for the price of one. However, I would wait for the upcoming Jasmine compilation cd of Perry Como in December, 1999. I would much prefer one cd of first-rate selections and quality, than 2 of less than excellent recordings. Compilation recordings are a real art form to select content well, and this new series is a disappointment. Also, this 'box set' had no liner notes or enclosed booklet describing any of the tracks."
3,TDK Printable 16x DVD-R,Media is CMC MAG AM3Writes good in my Pioneer 112D Drive.Print surface (to hub) is fair from my Pixma 6700.Verbatim makes a better disc both print and media wise.
3,for time only,"Simply,Visually it is appealling, and its time is accurate, but the alarm is hit or miss. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt."
2,No Talking Please,"The music would be great if he would stop talking thru it.Music only, no talking please."
3,"Grating Voice, Valuable Imagery","As a mindfulness meditation teacher, I feel that this program has valuable material, unfortunately it would be put to better use if the Dr. had hired a better ""voice."" We can all become accommodated to a particular voice during therapy and treatments, the brain becomes attuned to it over time. But I do not find this person's tone and measure of speaking conducive to the intended results. Too bad."
2,Nice idea but voice is all wrong,He is not the person to record this CD. His voice is too strong. I wish that I could get my money back. I like the idea though.
5,Blood II Nightmare levels,The add on levels were nothing short of fantastic. The gorilla fighting style on the opponents is even better. This game was way ahead of its time. I saw it on a friend's computer with 128Mb video card. The visual effects were so good!
4,ROAD TO HEAVEN,"The organization and writing are somewhat scattered in ROAD TO HEAVEN; however, the book is informative and very inspiring."
3,No shortcuts to heaven,"This book provide a fleeting image of cloud people, the Chinese hermits who have turned their backs on this world of red dust. There is a stark contrast between the monks and hermits, and the busy American, rushing about asking homely questions like ""Were you upset when the Red Guards burned your library?"" or ""Do you get any mail?""Yet, I find myself returning to ""Road to Heaven"" because there are a few anecdotes, gems and asides about famous hermits that make it worthwhile reading. Searching for a lost quote, I return to the hasty interviews with abbots and nuns standing guard at old temples and shrines. And I find more to their stories than first meets the eye.There is stillness and tranquility in the frugal lives of the Chinese hermits, and a firm unwavering grip on the essentials of religion. They represent the last living flicker of the spiritual wisdom originating with Lao-tzu. And now their world vanishes into the darkness, like sparks from a windswept fire."
3,Disappointing,"To me, what is most striking about this book is how utterly mundane it is. It appears the Mr. Porter was perfectly positioned by his previous life choices to experience these treks in search of Taoist nuns and monks. The people he met seem to have been fascinating, exceptional human beings. The places he went must have been wonder producing to the extreme. And what he did with all this perfect location in being is mostly a dry recital of having met such and such a person at such and such a place. Then moved on to another person and place. If he had titled the book, ""Wandering in the Void,"" he would have made a nice little joke about the waste and emptiness he brought to a once-in-the-history-of-humanity opportunity."
5,One of my all time favorite books,I have read this book twice now and it is one of my all time favorite books. The author's warm writing style mixed with stories that inspire me to take a little time and find my own quiet space make this a book that feeds my soul.
4,Great Overview,In working for a fund of hedge funds (similar to the author) I found this book to be very accurate. It's a great overview of the industry (particularly from the fund of funds side). I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good overview of the business.
5,An Excellent Resource for those who aren't mainly Finance people,"This is an excellent resource for learning all about Hedge Funds and how they work. This book delves deep enough into the various aspects of Hedge Funds to be very instructive but not too analytical. Not a book for dummies and not a PhD in Finance reference, a great resource right in the middle. This book is perfect for those who are looking for a relatively in depth knowledge of Hedge Funds without boring themselves with too many analytical and overly academic concepts and theories."
1,Boring book; there are much better books out there on hedge funds,"This book is more on investing in stocks/bonds/futures/... and not on hedge funds at all. There is a whole lot of material on risk/reward-ratio's, small/large caps, taxes, trading psychology, ... but very little material on hedge funds. If you're interested in reading about investing in general and how stock investing works you might give this one a try, but just don't expect to read all about hedge funds.If you want a good book on hedge funds:- Jim Cramer - Confessions of a Street addict- Barton Biggs - Hedgehogging- Faber - The Ivy portfolio (it contains just 1 chapter on hedge funds but it will give you more information on hedge funds than this book does)"
5,More than a rosebud!,"Another wonderful Hungarian voice to compare with Marta Sebestyen's! The backing music is modernist (i.e. does not employ 'traditional' instruments) but is generally very good. Only on one or two tracks (for instance, no.13) does it become disco-ish and spoil Iren Lovasz's efforts. This is a minor problem on a 56-minute CD, and should not prevent anyone buying it."
5,"Dark Star Crashes, Pouring Its Light Into Ashes","What are the best years for DARK STAR? I would say: 1969, 1972, 1973, 1974. Bam.Those are the great DARK STAR years (with, of course, individual exceptions here & there, such as Fillmore East 1970...and even Madison Square Garden 1990! 1971 has a few good Dark Stars, but in 1971 they are all relatively short versions. 1977, in itself a great year, has no Dark Stars, to my knowledge). Therefore, I was extremely pleased to see the re-release of Dick's Picks 28, a prime 1973 offering, which has an EXCELLENT Dark Star on it, every bit as good as the stellar Winterland 1973 Dark Star. For that reason alone, I highly recommend Dick's Pick 28."
4,The basic concepts of TESOL/TEFL education . .,"""First, I am a professional educationalist at the world reknowned Berlitz Langauge Schools. I teach Emglish for a living.""I am an educator so the requirements for an educationalist may be different.Well, it is clear from this review that this individual does not hold an MA in TESOL. Aside from the fact that renowned is spelled wrong, the concepts of affective filters, operant conditioning and interference are the basic concepts that even Berlitz has utilized in their courses.These ideas are worth knowing and are the basic lingo of the profession."
1,pretty bad,"doesn't stay on well like the marware. too bad. no great at all. but the service was great, came fast, etc."
1,not good,"I am a chef, I have used the best food mills out there, and this is not one of them, in fact, this is a waist of metal, it does not work at all.That is hard to admit, as I love all-clad pans, they are the best."
1,Not made in the USA,"If you are looking for a food mill that is made in the USA, this one is not. Even though in the description it says it is. I ordered this item and never even took it out of the box. After reading that it was made in China I returned it. The inability to find things made in the USA anymore is very disappointing."
5,Well-Made Product,"If you are in the market for a food mill, I highly recommend this one. While it is a little more expensive than most, you are definitely getting a sturdy, high quality item. I bought this one to make baby food and so far it has worked great. Since it is so sturdy I will be able to use it for many years. Also the threee different size discs are a great bonus."
2,very disappointing,"For those who have read The Safety of Unknown Cities, this formulaic romance novel will be a real letdown. It's for fans of romance fiction, not fans of Lucy Taylor. A story of three sisters in the 70s who find love through various paths, it has little to recommend it beyond being a book that you can read easily on a plane. I found a used copy, but I can't recommend that anyone else bother."
2,Good book with a bad description of the product,"Although this looks to be a great book, I was disappointed to see the giant inscription on the first page of the book. Because this book was for a gift, noting this inscription on the product description would have been very helpful"
3,Good food but lacking instructions for 30 minute preparation,"I like the fact that this book actually groups recipes into meals, which Ms. Ray's first cookbook did not (it was really 30 Minute Recipes, not MEALS). Many menus I recognize from her show, which I enjoy very much. However, part of what makes Rachel's show informative is that she not only discusses the food and recipes, but how to organize in order to prepare the entire menu within 30 minutes. The cookbook gives you 3 recipes per meal, and no other help. An instructional section for each menu would make this book perfect. Something like this: 1) Preheat oven for bisquits. 3) Mix the sausage, pat out, and begin cooking. 3) Open the bisquits, top with blah blah..... But I still do recommend Ms. Ray's books for their simple, accessible recipes that introduce people to new styles of food and cooking that can still be simple and quick."
2,Mixed satisfaction with recipes,"Yes, these recipes can be finished in 30 mins when you are somewhat organised in your kitchen. Yes, recipes are also suitable for get togethers.However, I was not 100% happy with this book for two reasons -one, some of the recipes are not very creative and probably everyone who has lived with flatmates at some point in life has done them...two, photos of presentations would make all the difference in the world...Most of us use more than our sense for taste when cooking and enjoying a meal and that also applies for getting ideas what to cook."
3,Great for Busy People,"I couldn't wait to purchase this book because Rachel Ray is one of my favorite Chefs on the Food Channel. I enjoyed the recipes I have tried so far but I feel that the book's overall presentation is somewhat boring. I would have liked to see more pictures of the food being presented. I love Rachel's style on TV. She is informative and up-beat and most of all she presents the food in such a way where I want to run to the kitchen and cook up what I've just seen. Hopefully, Rachel's next book will be presented in as captivating a way as she is on TV."
2,Had multiple scratches not discount marker like stated in product description,"I ordered this book from the bargain books and according to the product description, it was only supposed to have a watermark or sticker on it stating it was a bargain book. I was ok with that, given that the price was much cheaper than other stores. When I received my book, it had an amazon sticker-as stated in the product description- which was ok. However, instead of the bargain sticker or watermark on my book, I found a big scratch on the front cover where a sticker had obviously been scratched off and another scratch on the back cover! That was not what I had been expecting."
1,Not as described.,Purchased this item and thought shipping was expensive but the overall price was good. When it arrived and we removed it from the box we knew that it would not work for our fireplace. We needed a fireplace screen that was bronze as this shows in the picture but this screen is a distressed gold. I contacted the seller and explained that the item was not as described. That it was in original box and tags were not removed. Seller emailed me and said that I was to pay for shipping (paid about $20 to get it here) and that there would be 20% restocking fee but due to my situation they would reduce it to 10%. It just was not worth it to pay to ship this thing back and then pay a restocking fee as well. I am a loyal amazon customer and have purchased many items throughout the years but this was not a good experience and will not purchase from this seller again.
3,Elegant screen,"This screen is very elegant, but had a bit more forest green than expected. It is well made and matches our Tuscan style living room."
5,looks great!,This added a whole different look to our fireplace. I could not be happier with this purchase. The quality is excellent.
5,Love it!,"We moved into a new house over the summer that finally had the fireplace I wanted! As summer turned into fall, I knew I had to look for a screen since the previous owners did not leave theirs behind. So glad I found this one! Imagine my surprise when I opened it and saw that it had small fleur-de-lis on it! I couldn't really tell from the picture that it had them. I am very happy with my screen and it looks beautiful in my fireplace and have gotten many compliments on it!"
3,Good enough for now,"Seems well put together & the rounded feet make it pretty sturdy. I am disappointed with the finish though. No where in the description does it state what color it actually is. The pictures are not clear enough to to make out that it is actually green in color. The scroll work, screen & outer frame is greenish with gold toned accents in the outer frame inserts. I assumed it would be black or dark shade of grey with the accent pieces. Again it seems well put together & don't like the hassle of returning it. Two cans of flat black spray paint will do just fine."
1,Looks nice as far as design... Had 2 buy paint and paint it...,"It looks nice, its good for a small fireplace... the paint and fram are all worn out and its green, not black and gold in the picture... I had to buy 2 spray cans from home depot to paint it into black..."
1,Lousy,"Opened the box, and took out what appeared to be scrap metal soldered by a 1-year old. Put it back in the box. Shipped it back.Stay away. Stay very far away."
4,Christmas gift,"This gift was for my son, Adrian. He has a form of Autism called Aspergers. He is very smart. He wants to study forensic science to find out why the person died. This will be his start at identifying organisms and many other things he can do. He is very into video games, but since he got the microscope he has been spenfing more time with his slides. this was part of the microscope gift."
4,What is says on the box.,"Some of the slides seem to be mis-labeled, but never the less it is exactly what it says on the box. 100 microscope slides, well prepared, coloured, and interesting to look at."
1,Nice wooden box and labels but poorly made slides,The box of slides I received were not good. Many of the slides were poorly fixed. I found several that had labels on them but were actually blank slides. I know how to use a microscope and I have seen many of these slides before in a laboratory. The slides I received were poorly made and poorly fixed. Will return.
2,"ok, not best..but will do for home school...","fast shipping, great in packaging, nice box, but will not stay clipped( snapped), slides ok to poor depending on which one u are looking at, some have debrie mounted under slides with the samples. The grasshopper mouth slide top cover was mounted at a angle and broke when my husband was moving it around to see the different sections :( , and still have not found the frog eggs even using the oil and changing light brightness...must add, I have had lots of micro classes in college, and I might have been expecting to much for a cheap cost (I bought on cyber Monday $60 + ).... I would have to thank long and hard about it, if I would buy again. But if home schooling it will be a great 1st step to see the micro side of our world. I am home schooling x3."
1,A real stinker,"If you want something that explains XSLT, don't buy this. The author hardly bothers to explain what anything really is, how it works, or what it's for. He provides lots of code examples, but doesn't explain them. He simply shows the code and the results. He seldom explains how the code generates the results.The author constantly introduces topics he says he'll explain in later chapters. You're often left wondering why he bothered because introducing things and not explaining what they do or what they are makes it difficult or impossible to follow the point he's trying to make.In addition, he sometimes introduces new features with examples that show how NOT to use them. He then does not provide examples of correct usage.I really wasted my money on this book."
1,"Sad, sad, sad!","This is just another disturbing computer science book that has never been competently edited. Very verbose, but the real oddity is the lack of meaningful words, or any words, to explain syntax when it is obviously needed. I was really sorry that I waisted my money and time reading this book after reading positive reviews. Never again will I make a purchase on so few reviews. Look for similarity in negative comments to find the truth about books in reviews."
2,Not For The Beginner,"Normally I enjoy the Mastering X series of books. I've read several in the past. This book, however, is not for someone new to XSLT despite the author's claims. It is full of undefined or poorly defined jargon which confuses the new practitioneer. There is no CD included so prepare to type A LOT when trying the examples. I'd have given this book one star except for the fact that it does have a lot of information in it. Don't expect to ""Master"" XSLT by reading this book without some prior knowledge of the technology and especially the jargon."
1,"Yes, it the suckiest flashlight ever","I agree with the other review. This flashlight sucks! The beam is not very strong even with new batteries. The new batteries last a RIDICULOUSLY short length of time. For the price I paid for this one horrible flashlight, I bought three at the General Dollar Store for $3.00 a piece, and they work great, with a very bright beam. Do not waste your money on this. I even hate the handle. It is too fat for my hand."
3,a toy?,"I didn't buy it as a toy! I bought it to replace one that bit the dust after nearly 10 years of use that I had purchased in the camper's section of Walmarts. I liked the blinking light and translucent case as I would be able to find it in the dark, and the price was reasonable. This one does not have a translucent (clear) case and it doesn't hold a charge very long , and that can be pretty agravating when it starts dimming. The initial product purhased seemed to hold charge better. But I still like it. Just have to try to keep spare batteries on hand. I bought 4 of them for family members."
2,"""Yes mother...""","You know, this book is okay... I mean, it brings up some good points, but Carolyn Hax ended up really annoying me. The whole time, it seemed like she was looking down her nose at me, like she was far more superior. No one wants to read a book that makes them feel stupid. I found her comments not witty, but petty. I don't want to be reading something that tells me not to do stuff all the time. It's never fun to be told what to do and when to do it. If I wanted that kind of treatment, i'd hang out with my mother.Parts of it are good, but if you're looking for a book that helps, look elsewhere... or learn your own dating philosophy, because Hax's seems to be nothing but rules, rules rules."
2,Duped again!,"People, people. When will you realize that advice books and relationship books are written by people worse off than you are?Hax is witty and smart and a good writer but she hasn't found love. She and her husband are splitting up."
1,A Great Book for Hypocrites!,"Physician, heal thyself. Hax was fun to read years ago when she first started her column, but she's grown tired and predictable. She wondered why she caught such hell when she and her husband divorced shortly before announcing she was pregnant and engaged to another man. She actually wondered. She needs a good advice columnist to straighten her out. I don't recommend she look for one in this book, though."
5,Like that smart-aleck friend of yours...,"...who always gives thoughtful insight while making you laugh at the same time. Offers good, humorous advice on what not to do when meeting that special someone. Some booboos are obvious, others not. Enhance communications with coworkers, friends, and with family members, in a positive way--the key is to be yourself and not put your life on hold until..."
3,smbss : Princess i Shrunk The Mario 's,"The adventure begins when the mario's, princes and toad are captured by the evil disguisting king koopa. They were throwned into the dungeon. Then comes Merlin the wizzard he free's the mario's and attacks koopa but something goes wrong Toad accidentely spoils some potion over the Mario's and then they shrink. koopa tries to catch the mario brothers again but he failed. Merlin makes a new potion to get the spell off the mario brothers....... and then defeat the evil koopa.Reviewed by Roy"
4,2nd Time was a Charm,"The only complaint I have is that the packaging on the first shipment of this order was not adequate. Looks like the seller listened when I sent them feedback because the second time was a charm.This is Fine China and there was not enough protection around the set to make sure it didnt get broken... so just that happened. Fortunately, since Amazon has such a great return policy, the same day I received the damaged item I went through the easy return steps and got a new set in DAYS and sent the broken one back.This is TRULY an amazing set. It goes with almost any color motif. You can use it with Gold or Silver Chargers... it is so luxurious and for over half the price you see at major department stores. Definately worth the price. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this set. You have to see it ... so buy it"
4,Very Good Collection of ABC's Songs,"Very Good collection of ABC's most popular songs. Includes a few excellent remixes. Please Note: Even though this is billed as a DVD-Audio Disc, This is NOT a DVD-Audio Disc. It contains 2 CD's and a Regular DVD Video Disc. Can't understand why Sellers can't/don't know the difference. Anyway, it's still a nice set to add to your library."
5,Melodic Techno-jazz meets indigenous chant,"This was a very intriguing recording. Recorded in Germany by a Finnish artist, all lyrics are traditional. Kirile Loo is a superb and subtle vocalist, and you don't need to understand Finnish to thoroughly enjoy this album because her voice is a very flexible, emotional instrument. Tiit Kikas is credited with all the instrument playing which range from sampler and electric violin to norwegian flute and tin whistle. Kirile's singing combines many traditional singing techniques with a sometimes jazz-like arrangement. Other songs sound like it could be native American chanting (some sound like they could have been performed by Ulali). Well worth the listen and the wait. But then I love Scandinavian roots music and how they stretch the limits in lovely ways."
3,Not bad.,"I found this book by surfing through recommendations on amazon. I really love a good zombie book, especially one that follows the romero rules. This guy tried something new, I give him credit for that. But it wasn't great. I think he keep trying to make the main character cool, but he kept on trying to justify it. The guy has sex with like two hot girls, and always saves the day. But in the end he's kind of a nerd. Don't get me wrong, this book is entertaining, I read it in two days, and I don't regret it, its just not fantastic. The one thing the author did that was really cool is when he describes a zombie in the first person. Really interesting."
4,Down the Road was fine by me,"I really enjoyed this book. Wish it was a bit longer, though. It's a Zombie horror story--I wasn't expecting Emily Bronte.I actually liked it better than the (very) good Brian Keene Rising novels--at least the zombie parts. Neat ending."
3,Author Has Some Issues,"I agree that the author of this book has some personal issues he explored in text for us all to read. I think he probably does have certain racial and anti-governmental bents as well as sexual fetishes he wishes to expound on and on and on. That having been said, I think that aside from those issues he doe's show some promise as a writer. Frankly, I wish there were more zombies in this book about zombies rather than the human on human pique he likes. Now that reviews of his work are easily found on the internet and this site it is up to the reader to make up their own minds regarding his value as an author. I've bought his second book already. Go figure."
1,"Awful, absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read","This book is shockingly awful. So bad I had to skip read to the end just to confirm that I wasn't mistaken and it may of gotten better but it didn't. The start is just bad, we are suppose to believe that a school teacher at the beginning of an apocalypse which hasn't even touched him yet would run over a police man killing him in a graphic way and be totally ok with it???? AWFUL AVOID LIKE THE ZOMBIE PLAGUE!!!!"
4,Mass Appeal,"This novel has more to it than I'd expected. I figured it would be little more than gratuitous violence and excessive gore (don't get me wrong-- there's plenty of that too), but I was surprised to find there was an interesting plot with depth and character development. It was really interesting to read how various characters reacted to the ""zombie apocalypse"". You could really tell the author put thought into every aspect of this book so that it would appeal to many different readers. Looking forward to seeing what happens in the next one."
3,A so-so-tale,"A zombie tale with sex...why? The author does a great job constructing his plot outline, teacher, loner, loss, trying to get home, he cranks the tension up and we stop for a bump and grind...why?Then we have renegade frat boys, keg party memories and murder mystery/drug dealer/corrupt cops. Huh? Frat boys and keg parties...yup. Well the Frat boys get eaten in the end so that's cool.On the plus side. He creates a great apocalyptic landscape and the FEMA camps, ""You're doin a heck of a job, Brownie"" are spot on. Zombies, guns and gore a-plenty, he really needed another 100 pages to flesh things out. Can't say that about alot of books."
1,Down the Toilet is more like the title...,"I read this book thinking I would enjoy another Zombie book. I found this book rather boring. The characters were poorly developed, and the plot was garbage. I honestly don't mind gore, and sex in a zombie book, but his way of portraying it was completely useless and unnecessary. I was hoping for more from the main character, but instead all I got was a bad taste in my mouth like spoiled brains. The story to me feels like it was a written by a high school student. And from what I did get about the book it was that Ibarra hates FEMA, the government and women. Awesome. -not- So please save yourself the money and Do not buy this piece of garbage. I wish I hadn't."
2,"ok, could have been better","This book was ok, still a good read, but ok. It could have done without the random love story and the sub plot about the ex-fiance. And wtf was up with the random sex scene in the school? I totally get what it's there for and its not like i didn't like it (heh heh), its just so random to go from bashing zombies to banging some chick in the locker area. Overall the gore was still present of course, and in graphic detail. Just the overall randomness and the love stories made no sense to me. I'm not going to be a dick and sit here and bash the author and his work because that would be wrong and present a view totally opposite of mine. I just think that the story could have done without a few of the parts to it that really didn't make alot of sense to me. With that said it was still a good read, and hell, its about zombies so who gives a crap what the sub plot is about as long as there are plenty of zombies!!!!"
1,Awful,"A Gary Stu of the first order. Always check the publishing house: this came from 'authorhouse' which means the author ponied up the cash to print it but not, alas, edit it or shape it. There's typos galore, mispellings, and just cringe-inducing writing. Thank God I got it from the library. The author tells the reader things instead of showing them---i.e., ""He felt fear""!----and that's what the punctuation looks like, too. Could have been a good tale, too, which is another disappointment.The writing is bad, the plot is not thought out, the author's prejudices come through, jarringly, in parts, as when he constantly presents the lead character's opinions as facts, and all of it combine to make a sludgy mix to drag through. All the dialogue sounded stiff, and was badly-punctuated besides.Nobody should be allowed to treat zombies like this."
2,Can't recommend it,I found this to be a generally disatisfying work. The characters are two-dimensional and the action less than exciting. This combined with the author's obvious obsession with the perceived evil of FEMA (and it seems the government in general) along with a gratuitous sex-scene (that is both unrealistic and more than a little gross) and a needlessly depressing ending make this a less than enjoyable zombie read and one that I cannot recommend.
2,lame,"This book was good for the authors first outing but it seemed like he added everything he thought was ""cool"", which would have been ok but alot of the scenes were obviouslly for himself..and not for the story. For example dedicating about 4 pages for a sex scene.. which was the biggest amount of time given to any scene... or another example running over cops just cause they had traffic stopped. Read if your really into zombie novels but other then that nothing new that you havent read before."
2,The best part is the end!,This book made me think that the author was telling us his personal fantasies and fears in a post apocalyptic zombie setting. He is obviously afraid of the government and has a crush on a fellow teacher at school. He is afraid of drug dealers and has a misogynistic streak. I will say that the way he ended the book was genius. I did love the ending.
2,Down the drain.,"I liked the writing style. The flow and tempo was good. I just was not invested in the the main character. I understand that he is a simple every day type. Just thrown into an unimaginable situation. But for Christ's sake at least grow a pair. I really can't wait for the zombie apocalypse, because hot women are a dime a dozen after the fall."
4,A hell of a trip,"Long before FEMA was a household name, Bowie Ibarra created a government-response nightmare in DOWN THE ROAD. In addition to the chaotic zombie aftermath so viscerally described by Ibarra, you also get strong characterization, an immediately-likable lead and one of the most poignant endings to any zombie novel. Good stuff."
4,Post-colonial cyberpunk,"This is an ambitious work. In it the flash and edge of cyberpunk collides with a Latin American culture out of step with the fevered pace of technology. The protagonist, Soledad, is an outsider to both worlds who finds herself slowly drawn into the heart of each in turn. In doing so, Foy combines the dystopic vision of Gibson's later works with a more post-colonial worldview. Witty,intelligent, and dreamy with more political and economic heart than standard escapist SF fare."
2,Very disappointing from an excellent author,"I've loved previous works by Foy but found this one very disappointing. The plot was nebulous; by the time I figured out what was going on, I didn't care. The writing, while always showing talent, was full of ""empty"" detail which neither elucidated Foy's (rather confusing) world nor advanced the plot. I found the main character petulant, annoying and ethnically improbable (Caribbean/Creole yet occasionally speaks in Scots dialect). This book is like a tangle of lush tropical undergrowth which would benefit from the use of a machete. I could not finish it. Read The Shift or Contraband instead."
4,smiths what you make it,good book of short stories. i love micheal marshall smiths spares and one of us. so i have to read all i can find of his and was not disapointed in what you make it.
5,My dog loves these,"These bones last a long time, don't stain the rugs, and occupy my dog for hours. Even after the granola is gone, they are great gnaw bones because they don't breakup and I don't have to worry about her digesting splinters."
3,review of allied stainless steel heated pet bowl with hutch mount,"I bought eight of these bowls for my pet rabbits which i keep outside in protected, but not heated, hutches. They work well and keep the water thawed effectively. I have 2 compliants about them, however. The first is that they are difficult to clean without completely removing them from the holder. This problem would be solved if a small drain with plug was added to each of them (which i may do myself since i have metalworking tools). I also think that if some sort of silicon sleeve were placed around the cord as it exits the bowl, it may be easier to pull out of the holder and tip over to clean. The second problem i have found is that a couple of them are not level and therefore the water tips out and has to be refilled more often. The product does keep the water thawed, but for 33.00 a piece, it should be a little easier to clean on a day to day basis."
5,"May be not by much, but still the best","Its still the smallest, and it still has the best interface (scroll+click wheel). The sound quality is great, and apple has paid great attention to detail.The competition is catching up though. Creative's latest, the zen touch has its own touch pad, and although heavier by 1.5 oz and slightly bigger, has a 24 hr battery life and offers FM tuning and recording capabilities (through its remote).I spent a lot of time deciding between the iPod and the zen touch, and went for the iPod. I've had it for a day now, and am not at all dissapointed. It rocks! (The zen touch also has reportedly a ""freezing"" problem.)Unless you need more battery life or FM capability, this is the player of choice. Look no further.A word of caution: ipodlounge.com reports many users having audio problems with the 4G ipod (static through the headphones), so be informed. Mine does not have any issues and functions perfectly."
3,an alright magazine for music,"under the radar has pretty good articles, pretty consistently. i wouldn't call it a good source for finding out about new bands, though, like others have said. i find arthur mag, wire mag, and devil in the woods mag to be a lot better for that.i find it funny that under the rader, in their current magazine cover, feature ""death cab for cutie"" - a band that is anything but ""under the radar"". they might as well have put ""the white stripes"" on the cover. however, all in all, under the radar is a pretty good magazine most of the time.sidenote: with finding out about new music, in general, if you just put some time into visiting label websites and listening to the bands on a label site, you'll find it's the best way to find out about new music because, rather than reading about it, you are actually listening to it, and forming your own opinions."
3,Under The Radar,"This magazine is great if you want to dive into the indie scene with no clue as to what that entails.If you know Belle from Sebastian, however, stick with The Big Takeover (an indie music mag so indie, you can't even buy subscriptions to it on Amazon)."
5,All you need to know and more...,"UTR is an honest, industry savvy magazine. It holds nothing back, has great interviews with artists who are just breaking though, as well as those imminently charting.The album reviews rock!Indie music laid out in all its splendour."
4,Classic microwave engineering book,This book is pretty well written and really help you understand the materials better. This book is pretty well organized and very easy to follow
3,Good Microwave Engineering Book,"This serves well as an introductory textbook; however, when one wants to go deeper (which will be necessary in most uses outside of the classroom), the references aren't always comprehensive enough. That being said, this is often where I start."
1,Not reliable,"I just purchased this item to test my NIMH rechargable batteries and my non-rechargable Alkaline batteries. It seems to work well with the NIMH rechargable. However, with non-rechargable batteries, the readings were inconsistent (note: you have to flick a small switch on the device to test non-rechargable batteries). I tested several brand new & used non-rechargable Duracell Alkaline AA & AAA batteries and either 1) couldn't get any consistent results or 2) failed to get any results. Not recommended..."
5,Excellent Music for Non-Goths too!,"I was fortunate enough to see this band Live at Dragon-Con in Atlanta. They were awesome! I immediately bought there CD and bought there Mini-Cd for my friend back home. They really changed my view of ""Goth Music!"" I really enjoy the entire CD, but my favorites are: Marilyn, My Bitterness & Walk Away - lots of raw, bitter emotion; Little Monsters - dark humor; and Prometheus - powerful lyrics. Definitely not just for Goths! This music is very vibrant, strong, emotional, and charged with dynamic energy. Some songs are extremely adaptive to the Club Dance Scene. The music washes over you and gets under your skin. I play it daily and share it with all my friends. This is a real winner!"
5,An essential must have cd!,"I discoverd The Cruxshadows a few years ago, and heard this CD after hearing two newer releases. However, this cd is just as wonderful as all of the rest. I've been fortunate to see the group live several times, and I have never seen such an amazing live performance! The band has so much energy and the lead singer, Rogue, is all over the place. He walks through the audience, he makes eye contact with the fans as he singing - its incredibly, wonderfully intense. Rogue has an irresistable charisma that comes through in every word he sings. ""Monsters"", ""Marilyn, My Bitterness"", and ""Clerestory"" are some of the stand out songs on this cd, but they are all wonderful."
5,Oopsie,"Needed to revamp this.. Back when I first heard this disc in 98 I was like.. It's great but the spoken word stuff wasn't my thing. But it's been years and I'm still spinning that disc and I don't skip a track. From the painful ""Marilyn, My Bitterness"" to the haunting ""walk away"" to the dancey ""monsters"" this album is pure magic. This is one of the few bands in the darkwave genre that is this deep. If you're a fan of darkwave/goth music you have to get this album. You won't regret it. If you don't like it then well.. contact your doctor and get those ears checked out.. because this is the real deal.."
2,overrted and overplayed!,"When the DJs at goth clubs first started playing ""Marilyn my Bitterness"" and ""Monsters"" I thought that even though the vocalist has a pretty damn annoying voice, the songs aren't bad. But after hearing them constantly at every goth party over and over again I got so sick of them! :o/ I borrowed this CD from a friend out of curiocity and I thought that the rest of the songs were nothig special. The whole thing is incredibly cheesy and the lyrics are plain dumb. There is one track where this guy mumbles something about the Anubis, the master of souls, and that just made me laugh! Musically I would describe it as Dead or Alive with a cheesy rock ""geetar"" mixed with the weakest moments of And One or Depeche Mode. I certainly hope that since the Cruxshadows just came out with a new ""masterpiece"" the clubs put to rest the aforementioned 2 ""dancefloor sensations"" from this CD!"
3,Untitled,"This CD is melodramatic. Period. Anyone who likes electronic music and melodrama will enjoy this. I thought it was a decent album and I'm glad I bought it. It is an interesting album, simple lyrics with little depth and much sincerity. It is an intelligent album, a bonus, but isn't as evocative as the likes of David Tibet, Ian Curtis or Lisa Gerrard (touchstones all)."
5,Buy 2 copies of this album...,"You will listen to it so much you will wear down your first copy. Or you friends will borrow it for months and not want to give it back! This album is exciting, original and smart. It is a refreshing burst of energy injected into a genre of music that can get a little boring with stereotypical images of doom and gloom. ""Telemetry"" weaves a story of fallen angels and satellites, conjuring pictures of red planets and Egyptian pharoahs. And you can, and most likely have, danced to a lot of the songs here, like ""Little Monsters"" and ""Marilyn, My Bitterness,"" as they were big club hits. And when you're done listening to this album, listen to Book II in the Angel Cycle, ""Mystery of the Whisper."" They are a great new band and deserve even more of the attention they have already recieved."
4,The Greatest band on earth,You may not no this band but to me there the greatest band on earth. there is no better band. Telemetry of a fallen angel is there second best cd (Mystery of a whisper is there best) The songs on telemetry of a fallen angel are so good the lttle exsertes at the end of jackal head about the egyption gods is awsom and the song is great itself. Satolite is about the faces that have ben discoverd on mars. There is so much meaning in all the songs and the violin just cuts through me and i love it. well i wish i had time to exsplain this more but just get the money and get this cd yourself and than you can make your own review wellbye byeKeith*:o)
4,Veil of Gossamer,"I was new to celtic progressive rock, but Dave Bainbridge has produced a CD that is definitely rock and still true to his celtic heritage. I especially enjoy the ballad ""Until the Tide Turns"". It is the tune that made me buy the album."
2,Disappointed,"I expected more from this book. I don't know who all of Mrs. Friedman's students have been but I do know that Willem Dafoe trained with her. I didn't feel that I needed 200 pages or so to show me how to lift a monologue from a scene. The way she composed most of the monologues was pretty bad also.I do, however, think that it is important to show beginning actors how to compose a monologue from existing material. Also, her personalization exercises(i.e. words and pictures) were fairly weak. I think that The Monologue Workshop by Jack Poggi is a bit of a better book. The bad thing about books like this is that they try to cram imformation about monologue work and an entire course on acting into one book. That just doesn't work. Another book that's pretty good is Larry Silverburg's book Loving to Audition."
2,Well.....,"When I bought this book, I think I expected more than what I got... It was somewhat helpful... There are actually only about 30 pages of info on monologues. The rest is just a bunch of worthless scenes from old plays."
1,Deceitful rubbish and FRAUD.,"This is the worst strategy guide I have ever read. Selby Bateman is a liar and a thief for publishing this so-called strategy guide because it contains about sixty percent NONSENSE. He calls units the wrong names half the time, made up bogus strategy to get the book done in time for release, and seems NOT TO CARE about having committed any of these wrongful acts on the buying public. ONLY LISTEN TO ME ON THIS ONE, BECAUSE ONLY I AM TELLING THE TRUTH HERE. DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS GARBAGE, PURE AND SIMPLE."
3,There is a lot to be taken into account on this recording,"I guess that this is one of those recordings when the generational gap does matter. I am 32 years old and I grew up in the early 80's listeningto period instruments performances of these works. I guess if had been much older today then my views of this recordings would have been different. My mother today thinks that this is one of the best recordings,ever of the music of Bach, and indeed it must of been back in the early 60's, but recent researches, and more ""historically informed"" performances put this recording way back near the end of the line. Just think when listening to this recording that it used to be the standardat a certain time in history, and that we can still draw a lot ofgood information on how music was performed in the past, before earlyinstruments formed their own bands..."
4,For the cost - I think it is worth it,"I think it is a blast and worth it for the low price. It has the 97 edition on it and is exactly how I remembered it. Of course, it is nothing compared to 2008 Golden Tee. But then again the 2008 is around [..]."
1,"Buyers beware, not worth the money.","Horrible product, very cheap. Put the cabinet together, played it for one night and the product never worked right again. Never forget the old saying, you get what you pay for, stay away."
1,Mad About You - Season Five,"We are great fans of MAD ABOUT YOU and were looking forward to enjoying each episode on the 4 discs of the Fifth Season. However,each of the four discs contained episodes that were totally unplayable, and one of the discs had four episodes that ""scrambled,"" for lack of a better word. The ones that did play were quite good, but too many just scrambled and froze up."
4,The Buchmans and baby...,"Season 5 brings us the Buchmans' anticipation of their soon-to-be first child -- and of course, all the mix-ups, drama and hilarity that accompanies their journey. Paul and Jamie deal with their own clashing ideas and opinions, their friends and family. Jamie must find the balance between motherhood and career, as well as the Buchmans' beloved dog Murray.Guest stars include Carol Burnett as Jamie's mother and Mel Brooks as Paul's uncle -- both eccentric in their own way, as essentially all the extended family members are.Viewers are in for lots of laughs as they await Baby Buchman along with Paul and Jamie."
5,Always one of my favorite series,"Loved this show when it was on the air, and was glad a year or two ago to see DVDs for some of the seasons, and like many people, was frustrated when it seemed like we'd never get 5, 6, or 7.I was very happy when season 5 came out, since in my opinion season 4 was the worst of them all (but still decent). I hated that my collection ended with that low point in the series life. Season 5 is where it started getting good again.Quality is good, no problems with sound or video anywhere on any of the discs. I have captures of seasons 6 and 7 but not great quality, so now I'm just waiting for the next DVD's to some out. At least there's word that it won't be as long between now!"
5,Love the show!,"I absolutely love the show Mad About You and am excited that they're finally selling Season 5 on DVD. I've been slowly buying the seasons over the years and will be thrilled once they finally have the 6th and 7th seasons out (not sure why it's taking them so long). If you are like me and loved watching the show back when it was first airing on TV, you'll enjoy falling in love with Paul & Jamie all over again with the series on DVD. Completely recommend it to any fan of the show!"
5,Super Active Roy!!!,"After listening to Roy Wood through the Move, Wizzard, and any solo projects from the late 60's and early 70's I figured there was no way he was going to come close to that collection of music. Surprisingly enough I was wrong. Super Active Wizzo takes his well crafted music style to another realm. Roy Wood was fusing jazz elements with steel guitar. The guitar is precise with no break out leads just intricate arrangements. Once again we see Roy taking over on most of the instruments like the sitar. Dave Donovan is a welcome addition on drums. His very complex and changing style keeps the album fresh the whole way through. It is also nice to see the return of Rick Price from the Move and Wizzard. I guess this just proves you cannot go wrong with Roy Wood."
4,NHL EASTSIDE ICE HOCKEY MANAGER 2005 Reviewed,"Being a Hockey fan, with MS, I was seeking a more cerebral game to play that did not require fast hands to play. This is just that type game. It has many limitations such as making you fiscaly responsibile yet unable to make but a few changes in that category. That form of limit can be found elsewhere too. This is more a business game than a hockey game where the actual game is not as important as the team management. It even has you in some control of the minor league affiliates. Over all an addictive game that requires the player to be the GM of a team over a period of years. Yes, you can be fired."
4,Discover Biff now!,"This album is a bit of a departure from the wackiness of some of his songs- it's stark in places, sober and even gut wrenching; but the songwriting is Biff at his finest. Discover one of the most eclectic singer/songwriters of our time."
2,Biff Rose has become hate monger.,"His old music was so strong, he was a great performer too.His music has been forgotten, he wasn't able to stay near the top and he is apparently ravished by madness. Just checkout his websites. A raging bigot. His writing is pretentious incomprehensible hate filled drivel.. Yecch!What a bummer."
5,The Lost Episode of Rumpole,"I saw this DVD in December of 2004. It was a recorded episode presented as a play on British TV and turned out to be a pilot for the series since its success resulted in the series being created. It was a little more dramatic than the series episodes, and had a different actress portraying the wife (She who must be Obeyed). There was more character development of Rumpole and featured more tension between Rumpole and his son. I found it better, though less comedic than the series, but nevertheless very enjoyable."
4,Rumpole of the Bailey,"We have the complete series now. So happy we were able to purchase The Lost Episode. The British Mysteries, Detective Stories, etc. are far better than those we see in the USA. They have far more class and the writing, acting, etc. is excellent."
3,Hilda........,"Not bad overall, especially if you want to see a pre-Rumpole before Peggy-Thorton-Bates assumes the role of Hilda. It is only one hour and a bit pricey, but it was after all a play originally written for a BBC series. I think it was our equivalent of a ""skit""? Worth a look for sure."
3,Saddened and Disappointed,"The basis of the character Rumpole is presented and one can see the basis for the unique Rumpole. Unfortunately, ""She who must be obeyed"" is barely recognizeable as herlater character; which is to the good. The element of saddness is that Rumpole is so wrapped into his own life at the Bailey that he is oblivious to the fact that his son not only does not share his interest but strongly resents the Bailey as a rival for his father' attention and love. The disappointment is that Rumpole who is so perceptive in so many areas of life (which revolve around the Old Bailey) that he is oblivious to his son's true feelings. Even when his son confronts him and spells out his hostility, Rumpole is able to go on and continue with the lie that he and his son are close. That may be overstating it a bit; but, not by much."
4,Rumpole's lost episode,Being a big Rumpole fan I always wanted to see where it all started. This DVD is the first appearance of the old fellow and is more raw than his later TV series. It has Rumpole pretty much as he will be througout the series but his wife and son are different and not up to par as the actors who portrayed them later. Also the production values were a little weak and did detract somewhat from my enjoyment of the program.(that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) That being said though it is still good entertainment and the writing is great. For any fan of Rumpole I think this is a must have to complete their collection.
5,Good Rumpole,Rumpole fans will like this lost episode. Both seller and movie are first rate. Highly recommended
3,We must have it,"Lovers of Rumpole will agree that there is no such thing as a bad Rumpole story. This, the first, is probably the worst. However, we see that Leo McKern has already taken the measure of the character he portrays and made it his own. John Mortimer wrote the rest of his Rumpole stories so that Leo was a perfect fit.We expect to see Rumpole more rotund and with hair more gray, but we accept that here is a slightly younger, but still wise, version of our favorite barrister.The price for the DVD is excessive; but what are Rumpole lovers to do? We must pay because WE MUST HAVE IT!"
2,"examples use VBScript, not Javascript","Although the subject matter is well covered, all the code examples that I saw are written in VBScript. That renders the book effectively useless if you code your client side script in javascript (which is the industry standard).If you are a javascript coder then get Danny Goodman's Dynamic HTML, published by O'Reilly."
2,vita calm not so sure...,"I tried this on my horse, and could not not tell that it made any difference, would not buy it again."
2,disappointing,This video is not for someone who has never made a quilt. It reviews some of the basics but it does not clarify techniques used for hand quilting versus machine quilting.
4,Vintage Sidney,"Nice tunes from this famous British artist. Good transfer to CD. Too many words required for these reviews, I think."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book was probably very good about 10 years ago. However, companies now use the Internet, Electronic Resumes and specific software to look for qualified applicants. This book touches maybe 2 pages on this new approach to job hunting. To be competitive you need to know how to follow the technological revolution of electronic resumes. If you plan to work for a mom and pop company the old style would probably suffice but if your looking to work for a Fortune 500 company forget it!"
4,great product,Not a total feedback killer but does cut roughly 50% buzz. Use a Taylor 814ce live with Bose L1. Looks great too.
3,Works OK,"I use this on my Taylor for church gigs and it works really well if I'm using in-ear monitors—keeping it from feeding back with the main PA. If we use stage monitors, it doesn't prevent feedback unless I'm at a really low volume."
3,"Ok, but just a milimeter larger would have been ideal","Most cards fit, but with some nudging and careful shoving. Irregular cards, thick cardboard cards, etc. don't fit at all. If only the slots were a tiny bit wider, these sleeves would be much easier to use. As it stands, once a card is in, it is almost impossible to pry it out."
2,Short Weak Boring,"I was very disappointed with this video. For one it's incredibly short. At 37 minutes it's barely longer than a you tube ski movie. Maybe if that 37 minutes was packed with sick tricks and huge skillful maneuvers I could at-least give it a 3 star rating, but it's just not. This movie is really just a couple of good skiiers messing around with a camera. It's just packed with 180's and a few 720 grabs. Nothing done on this video exceeds what an average advanced freeride skier can pull off. I'm down with watching peoples home ski videos but not paying for them as if they are full of expert skiers and camera men. And to top it off the soundtrack sucks. Watch it, just don't add it to your collection."
1,Unreliable Junk,"Purchased this item and worked okay intially, then after a month the batteries ""died"". I replaced the batteries and it worked okay again for a couple of months, then the keypad was unresponsive again. I tested the batteries this time and they tested okay. The keypad worked one more time, and then never again. Plus the manual key override failed, making the safe unlockable.This safe is unreliable at any price, let along the $60 I paid incl shipping. Do not buy!"
1,"Commercial lights on, nobody home.","It was bad enough having to look at a cutesy cartoon of a sea captain throughout this book, but then when this same jolly figure was placed alongside details of death - well it just seemed to indicate that whoever pulled this book together just didn't get it. This was an epic tragedy - not some cutesy little fun subject."
3,"Much information, unfortunately not always correct.","Information overload! Yes this has it all, from construction to passengers thru Titanimania that has sweeped the world. Very lighthearted, and easy to brouse through. Unfortunately, several errors are evident. From page 4 typo; Harland and Woolf, should be Wolff; to page 38 stating all first-class children survived, NOT so, young Lorrine Allison of Canada died with her parents. I counted 12 mistakes. Quite ironic for a book entitled the complete idiot's guide to the Titanic. But for the buff who has to have everything, go for it!"
1,Overrated historical event that shouldn't be remembered,The Spanish Influenza Pandemic killed 40 million people. The sinking of The Titanic killed around 1500. To the reviewer Piper. You wasted 15 years of your life studying this worthless Titanic event?
3,Work light - very bright but very hot,"This light is great to use in workshop areas but be very careful, it get HOT. Don't put it near anything that will burn. I couldn't believe just how hot this light got until I used it. I had it on for about 30 minutes and could feel the heat coming from the light. If you use this light beware of how hot it gets or you will get burned. Very bright light."
5,Knocks the wind out of you,Peter Szor is a genius.The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense is a great book from one of the top AV people around.the book is over 700 pages of good informaiton. There is no filler here. this is tech writing at its best.
2,Over my head,"This book has many typograhical errors. Many of the author's descriptions are incomprehensible to me, leaving me more puzzled after reading than before. I am a beginner in this field, perhaps beginners should avoid this title until they are familiar with the jargon of the field."
4,Great Single-CD Compilation,"Before buying this CD I have known only a few songs by Joe Jackson such as STEPPIN' OUT, BREAKING US IN TWO and YOU CAN'T GET WHAT YOU WANT. I am pleased to find much more great songs such as ""Jumpin' Jive"" one of popular jazz compositions or uptempo I'm A Man. Today I keep listening to this CD over and over again and thinking about buying his other CDs.The compilation originally released in 1990 has been doing a fine job for introducing one of the greatest songwriters who made some huge hits during mid 80s. The track is ordered chronologically and its tracks included show what Joe Jackson is. His music is sometimes jazz-flavored, raggaeish, and his greatest hit so far STEPPIN' OUT is an excellent techno-pop tune. My only complant for this compilation is it misses my favorite song from Body and Soul, HAPPY ENDING. Otherwise I am quite satisfied with this CD.Verdict: Well-balanced and comprehensive workRating: 88 out of 100Recommended for: Jazz-flavored soft rock fans."
4,My favorite Dictionary Series.,"This has got to be my favorite German-English Dictionary out there, or at least, the Harper-Collins series dictionaries are. I love the College dictionary, but this one is pretty great. I would recommend the newer editions, but still, if you can find a great price on this one, I'd take advantage of it. Has simple layout and extremely useful Grammar and Verb section in the back! What a deal!-Dr. Kenneth"
3,user-friendly but nothing too great really,"This is obviously a concise dictionary, but unlike for instance Webster's New World Concise German dictionary, this one would satisfy only intermediate level language needs and is kind of large for its coverage - compare for instance with the Oxford Pocket German which will do the same job except for the basic grammar part this one has at the back (despite all this both latter are more easy to use than the Webster's which is more sophisticated but also a little tiring to find words and then read). So this dictionary, i believe has no extraordinary features than its competitors and even some setbacks just mentioned. The grammar section is helpful but if you need more extensive coverage, and direct and rich grammar information beside each entry this wont do."
5,Quick Setup,This router is so much easier to setup than Linksys. So far it's been very reliable. Great for the price.
4,Cheap and efficient,"The router works great, easy to set up...just follow the manual inside. No regrets, it works!"
3,Not exactly for Vista,"Don't get me wrong, there is a method of getting this to work using Vista, but I couldn't get the unit to stay online long enough to use the internet site that'll allow you to set this thing up. Very frustrating. But I did find out as a result, that Amazon has a really good return policy that I took advantage of. Then I bought a Linksys router that was a snap."
1,This Router has no Range.....,I cannot believe all these good reviews i saw on here. i have been using this router for a month and i cant figure out why the Range on it is soooo short. I am 10 feet away and i get 1 bar. Poor signal. i dont understand that. ny previous router ws much stringer in the same posistion. I've even moved the router to different places and still the range sucks. VERY DISSAPOINTED. (read pissed).
4,"Easy to install, ready to go","I've had little trouble with this router so far and it's been 2 months. It was incredibly easy to install, the instructions were clear, and it worked right away. The only problem is that if I haven't shut down my computer in a long time (i.e. I put it on hibernate instead) it sometimes has trouble reconnecting to the router or the connection goes in and out, so I have to restart the computer instead."
5,"works fine, easy to setup",no problems setting it up and it seems to work just fine. inexpensive and does the job.
2,Not totally satisfied,"This router is hard to setup with Vistas although it says it is compatible you have to use a manual process. The manual steps are not easy to understand and then I had to call their customer service three times. On the third call, which each call lasted more than 1 1/2 hours, I was escalated to a senior level technician and was able to set it up. It works well now, but I have to reset it sometimes. I will never purchase another Belkin product and the communications barrier between the customer service agents (in India) is very frustrating."
5,An Inexpensive Wireless Router With Easy Setup & Good Performance,"Since this was my first time installing a wireless router, I was somewhat nervous if I could do it correctly and easily. Being a computer literate person that I am, I knew that installing the hardware was the easy part. But I was also pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it was setting it up wirelessly with my laptop.I definitely could have used this right out of the box wirelessly with my laptop, but I prefer to have certain security features turned on/off while I am online. And if you don't know what features to turn on/off, you can use the included CD to walk you through it.The size of this wireless router is very small. Its range is also very good for my small apartment. And so far, I haven't experienced any slowdown or loss of connection yet. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive wireless router with standard features."
5,"Works well, no issues",Worked out of the box. Very easy to configure.I have an older Belkin model which has been working non-stop since 6+ years with no issues. Hoping this one will be just as good.
5,Wireless Router,It is reliable and works throughout my home. It is small and unobtrusive.Chas E Moser
4,"Well, At the Very Least it Works","It was advertised as easy to install, and usable right out the box, but after plugging everything in and not being able to connect to the internet using my laptop, the ease kind of just flew out the window. I spent almost 3 hours on the phone with people from India who I could barely understand, and who clearly didn't care whether my product worked or not. To make a long story short, I finally got the router to work, and it's been working fine for the past month or so (knock on wood).So, the router is great and works fine. Hopefully you know how to set up your router by yourself because if you don't then you'll probably have to deal with some really unfriendly people."
5,wireless cable router,Plugged in and works.802.11g is more than adequate.Price & performance is excellent
2,Needs a daily Reboot,"I have had this product for a month now and have come to the realization that several days a week the router needs to be restarted due to lockups and slowdowns. I don't know why, tho I have noted that it has almost no ventilation in its design."
4,Product is working fine in a 2 bedreoom appartment.,I bought this router 1 month back and till now there is no problem in connectivity. I had installed it in a hall and can access internet from any room.Setting up secure network is also very easy.I would recommend this product a must buy in a given price range.
5,Up & Running,"The is my second wireless router, and it is relatively smaller than my previous one, a Linksys. Its (Belkin) rough dimensions are 5in x 5in x 1in. It came with couple of side ""fixtures"" that allows me to let it stand on its side to save space. Setting up was pretty easy after following the instructions that came with it. It says that it wasn't created for Vista and to follow the manual's instruction before installing or setting up, hmmm. I never installed anything, just plugged my modem to the little belkin, and Voilà ... instant connection using my wireless adapter on my desktop. Adjusted a couple of settings online and here I am still connected. Well, I have been using this product, for a little under a month now and I have to say it has not given me any problem(s) yet (knocks on wood). So basically, I'm satisfied with this product so far."
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this product not knowing much about wireless routers. I use this for my laptop and my ps3 and have had no problems what so ever with this product. I had a little trouble setting up my laptop with the usb adapter that I bought (also Belkin), but the woman for customer service was helpful and walked me through the process. I have only used the wireless connection with the laptop and ps3 in the same room or just in the next room and the signal remained excellent or very good. I liked this product so well I recommened it to my sister. She has dsl and complained that the internet speed is very slow. I have cable internet and the speed is just as fast as my desktop computer so it could just be the dsl. All in all a great product for the price."
4,easy and quick instal for Vista,It is just plug and play for Window Vista. Working perfect and competitive price.
1,What a piece of crap,"Slow and flaky at the best of times, this router's problems only increase when more computers attempt to join the wireless network. Once I had four wireless clients (2 mac & 2 PC) things ground to a halt completely. The router would randomly stop responding and would need to be rebooted every few minutes. I'm throwing this piece of junk out with the garbage and buying a Linksys."
2,Poor Signal,"I was disappointed with the signal strength. I could only get a signal in one room in my house. It is also time consuming to set this up with Windows Vista. I guess if you pay for a cheap router, that is what you get."
3,"Easy to set up, max 2 on Wifi","Very very easy to set up out of the box. Not the weakness of this unit. I seem to have alot of trouble though with 2 things+ on wifi at the same time. If you put an iPhone and a laptop on wifi at the same time, it seems slow. Maybe I need to restart frequently, like once a week. Wired is fine. I'd give it 3.5 if I could."
4,Great value. Comparable to Linksys,I got this router from AMZ over a year ago and it has been really reliable. It's just as fast as a Linksys router with speedboost and is about 40% cheaper. This router is on the first floor of my house and I get a good signal in my attic or in my backyard.
4,Belkin ME1004-R Wireless Cable/DSL Router,The router was very easy to set up. I have not had any dropped signals. I use it between my desktop and laptop in different parts of my house. Works great. Very happy with the purchase.
3,Belkin ME1004-R Wireless Cable/DSL Router,"This router was very easy to configure and get running right out of the box. It seems to have good coverage and performance for the price. The only problem I'm having is my computer keeps downgrading the connection speed from 54Mbps to 11Mbps, even when I'm right next to the router, and it occasionally drops the connection completely. Both of these are annoying, but since my computer is junk (DELL D600), I can't be sure the problem is the router. (I use the REPAIR function to reset it back up to 54Mbps when it slows down.) Otherwise, it's been fine."
2,Impossible to set up if you have a macbook,"I have a Macbook, so I actually did a bit of research to see which wireless router would work best. I was too cheap to get an actual Apple product. Anyway, I put in the CD and followed all the instructions, but it refused to connect to the internet. It asks you to continue trying up to 10 times (which is ridiculous) but I did anyway. I ended up having to call tech support who eventually walked me through the set up manually...NOT using the crappy instructional stuff it came with. All in all, it now works but I don't know if it was worth the grief it caused before I got it working."
2,It Sucks,"The Belkin ME1004-r Wireless router was pretty easy to install I had a little troube getting my computer to recognize a connection with the router, but after a little tweaking I got it to work. After a few days the router disconnected itself somehow and now I cannot get it to reconnect, at this point I would say that this router sucks monkey toes."
5,great product,"really great purchase, works in a fairly large hous-reaches every roomsmooth set up and smoothly works for macs"
4,Works very well,"What should have been an easy installation, wasn't. I was on the phone with customer service for 1/2hr or so. But after installation, the router has worked great. I'm really glad that I bought this product."
3,Wireless hard to hook up,It took me about 3hrw with a bunch of guys from India to hook this up. It does work fine now.
1,No Show,"I ordered the product and paid for it, but it could not be shipped to me, and my money was refunded. No explanation why this happened."
3,It was ok.,The router was fine for the wireless. The performance for the ethernet cable was not as good as the wireless. The security (WPA) was easy to implement and works well.
2,Outdated and setup nightmare,"First of all, I'm a professional tech and I install routers all the time. I am not a newb at this. That said, what should have been a simple 15-minute install took almost FOUR HOURS. Do you have that kind of time? Right, so everytime I tried to input the correct settings, it just wouldn't take them. Or worse, it would *pretend* it did when it really didn't. After a while I thought maybe Firefox was causing the problem, but no, it did this in IE too. And the having to wait 30 seconds each and every time you changed something was lame. As soon as you hit ""save"" on a Linksys router it's done. Otherwise the router seemed fine, but without getting settings saved properly I couldn't trust it.I finally gave up and got a Linksys N router."
1,Couldn't get it to work,"Although set up seems simple, I could not get it to work and ended up returning it (I have a Macbook Pro OS X 10.5)."
4,excellent product,This product is everything and more than I expected from Belkin.The technical support was superb. They help me insatall thisproduct in minutes.GO Belkin!Very happy customeer
1,"Cheaply constructed, power cord didn't stay plugged in!","The cheapest construction imaginable -- we literally had to hold the power connection with our hands to keep it from falling out. Save your time, save your money, and go with another product."
1,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!","Whatever you do, rent rather than buy this instrument. This is not a good choice at all. PLYWOOD?! You need a real ebony fingerboard and who cares about horsehair. Some of the worst bows come with ""real horsehair."" As an experienced violist, don't buy this instrument. Go to your local store and rent a viola or violin. This is a very bad choice. If you NEED to buy a violin or other orchestra instrument online, take my advice and go to sharmusic.com. Don't waste your money on this viola."
5,Authentic!,"I could never pass a honkey tonk and the Winchester Club was on my way home. I have heard Ikey and the Sweat Band play these songs live live, I have the vinyl, the CD and have had the pleasure of dancing to the recorded version of the Cotten Eyed Joe in bars from Texas to Ireland to Australia. Ikey always folowed the Cotton Eyed Joe with the Schottische and I always feel something is mising when they are not played together.If you are looking for an authentic version of the Cotton Eyed Joe - this is it. It is also a pretty decent recreation of the Sweat Band's nightly sets at the Winchester Club.I'll keep looking for an hoenst bowl of red. In the meantime - allons dancez!"
5,He was my Father,The record company that released this album after my Father passed away is about to get a wake up call. They didn't ask my permission nor have I seen a dime of royalties. I am his only son and have exclusive rights to all his work. I love the album but they should have asked me first. See you in court!
1,"Miserable, dull and boring","I was a fan of George Foy. But gone is the clever and witty writing from his earlier work. After wallowing through half of the book, I gave up. Little plot, little action, just miserable exposition. Dull and boring. Read Neil Stephenson (anything) for quality writing, if you like this genre."
5,"Took a risk, but got exactly what I wanted.","There was a concern for me going into this that although it was advertised as a five-string, the Amazon picture only shows the four-string version. No worries, this is certainly a T25 five-string. The bass they shipped me was a little darker than the one in their pictures, but really looks a little better in my opinion. There is a slight buzz to the lower frets which is quite commonplace and nothing that can't be remedied by a guitar tech for about $50. Well worth it, and very happy with my purchase."
1,BEWARE OF ALL-CLAD MADE IN CHINA,Check carefully before buying from All-Clad.Many of their items are now being produced in China & quality has suffered.I ordered a piece which Amazon's description said was made in the USA.I called the company & they said ALL the braisers are now made in China but the quality is just as good.NO......IT IS NOT!The 3 ply is only on the bottom & does NOT go up the sides.They are lighter in weight.They are NOT usable on Induction Burners.YES.....they are a bit lower in price....BUT STILL EXPENSIVE.What bothers me is that All-Clad is being less than forthright in informing consumersof their MADE IN CHINA merchandise.
1,Dated and hard to hear,"This video lacks a nice sound quality. It is very affordable, but the scratchy ""white noise"" sound with the audio is very irritating and makes it hard to focus. The film reminds me of educational reel to reels we used to watch in the 60's in school. I do not recommend it, unless you really are only looking for film footage of sites in Vienna, where you will be playing it with no sound."
5,Ashby's plum tea,Shipped to us fast; Ashby's teas are the cream of the crop. Not heavy with the cinnamon. A favorite at our house. If you love this...their apricot is EVEN BETTER! Only Bigelow is near their league as far a tea goes (although I can also recommend Lisa's tea treasures too). A great afternoon tea after work.
4,Bad copy???,"I found the music acceptable except for Grace. The singing was very off key on certain parts, expecially at the end. Did I get a bad copy? The background music seemed OK but the vocal was off. If it was on purpose, I didn't like that and it made no sense to do that."
3,Watch out for defective copies,"Not their best but still a good album. However I am writing to let you know to watch out for defective copies. My cd had a 2 second blank space during track 8, candles. It did not sound like a thing the band did on purpose. SO I had amazon replace it and the replacement was the same. at 2:14 or so on track 8 the song sound stops while the counter keeps going. Tried it on 3 cd players and a computer. Still enjoying the cd though. Other albums of interest would be Within Temptation MOTHER EARTH, Nightwish ONCE, Anti-M DAMAGE, Lacuna Coil...well anything Lacuna does rocks, and Evanescence."
5,"2 words, A-Mazing","I had a friend of mine bring this cd back from Germany for me 3 months ago and I still can?t get over how good it is. the vocals are unbelievable, the musicians are great. I got into this style of music a few months ago and am so glad that I found it.the piano version of Restless is so good. I think it sounds better without the rest of the instruments. the other band that I really enjoy and that is like Within Temptation is After Forever. now they do have more gravely mail vocals but still the same concept. After Forever is a little more raw.My next purchase is Mother Earth, I cant wait."
5,Girls to Women; Their Love for horses and special trails,"I have read Julie Suhr's book cover to cover at least 5 times in the past 20 months. She strikes a chord in every woman who has ever had a horse in her life who was dearly loved. I've probably read the chapter called ""Pegasus"" three dozen times. I feel like I am riding the Tevis trail every time. Julie's writing from her experiences makes me want to be a better horseperson, and she makes it feel achieveable. I thank her from the bottom of my heart for sharing these experiences with me. Kerry"
5,Not only for horse lovers,"Of course this book is about endurance riding, but in the first place it's about realizing a dream becoming a passion, almost a way of life and enjoying it 110%. As a future endurance rider, more then a couple of times, reading Julie's story, I became excited but also rather emotional, especially where she describes her gratitude for what horses in her life gave her and still do until today. And finally her warm feelings for other people from whatever part of the world. It's a book that really makes you feel good!Richard P."
5,an extraordinary book by an extraordinary woman,"Even if you don't love horses, you'll find this book inspirational. If you do love horses, the chapter titled ""Pegasus,"" a story about the Tevis Cup ride (which Julie finished 22 times) will keep you spellbound. Julie's love and passion for horses and endurance riding gave her opportunities to ride around the world, and feel on top of the world. Her graciousness, humbleness, and appreciation of her life shines through in her writing. This book is worth a read, and a re-read. Incidentally, Julie donates all proceeds from this book to the AERC (American Endurance Riding Conference) Trails Committee, and the Western States (Tevis) Trail Foundation Trails Committee."
3,disappointing,"I love films and videos of major cities from the 1940s - 1960s and I thought this film of the former Third Avenue L in New York City would afford new views.The quality is barely watchable, the film itself is threadbare and it affords only the barest glimpse of what the view would have been like from the elevated train."
3,Good for kids in school,"Bought this for my toddler and although he likes it, I don't think it was quite age-appropriate for him given that he does not attend school. I would try to read through this before buying if possible (like maybe at a store or at the library) to make sure all the example situations are applicable before buying."
4,excellent message!,"This book discusses anger, its causes, how it feels, and most importantly, healthy options for dealing with it. Anger can be overwhelming and frightening for anyone, and even more so for young ones will little experience regulating their emotions.This book is empathetic ""When I feel angry I want to say something mean, or yell or hit. But feeling like I want to is not the same as doing it."" One of my favorite elements of this book is that it gives many options for dealing with anger, fromcounting to bike riding to walking away, and from being assertive to taking a nap, and from handling the problem independently to asking for help.I work in a classroom full of 3, 4 and 5 year olds, and kids sometimes call each other names, often grab things from one another and often would rather keep playing when the ""clean-up"" signal is given. This book is relevant to preschoolers.The last sentence I wish was a mantra for us all. ""When I feel anrgry, I know what to do!"""
1,Broke after about a week!,"All my son asked for from Santa for Christmas was a new Frogger game. He played with his father's original Frogger handheld game and it stopped working almost a year ago. He was so excited Christmas morning. We were not super impressed with the mirror and not very bright display, but we realized that as long as the top had a bright enough light shining through, it worked okay. After about a week or so, the joystick stopped working. The frog only moved to the right. It would turn on and light up, but the frog would just jump into the right corner of the screen. Very disappointing!"
1,Terrible product,Only takes two AA batteries that barely light up the screen. The one I purchased you can't even make anything out. Really a piece of plastic junk that isn't worth the trouble. Save yourself the money and don't purchase.
4,"Grab bag, but mostly Swing","This book covers a grab bag of reasonably advanced Java topics. These include collections, XML, some database access, and Swing. Roughly half of the book is Swing. The first chapter, which covers library design, is solid.The exposition is solid, if a little dry. The illustrations are good. The book does rely a little heavily on code to do most of the expository work.I recommend having a look at this book in person before buying it. See if there is enough there on the topics that interest you to make it worth the purchase."
1,Great product if you like polka dots,"I can't even believe this product is on the market. Not only is it impossible to get an even tan without spreading with your hands, the CO2 cartridge freezes up and is unusable within only a minute. I followed the manufacturers tips stating that you need to let it rest and it will unfreeze...it did not. So I placed another cartridge in and began using for 30 seconds before it froze and became unusable.ANother point is that you have to hold the unit upright at all times or else the fluid spills out. How is that consumer friendly? How do you do do your back?I didn't even bother getting my money back , I it threw away in disgust. Did I mention that you need to be in a fully sheeted room as the stuff goes everywhere and stains!I do not recommend buying this product."
3,Beautiful but faulty,"I purchased this watch for my son's birthday. The watch came in on time and the the style catches your eye (My son loved it as soon as he saw it). The reason for the three rating, once you put the watch on the clasp does not stay shut. Any kind of movement and the clasp opens up immediately. There were no instructions in the box to see if we were locking it in correctly."
3,An experiment that doesn't quite come off,"I'm a big fan of Catherine Aird's series of books featuring Insp C D Sloan. So I was interested to try out this non-series book. The structure of having two parallel cases, one in the past and one in the present, has been tried more or less successfully by several writers. It's tricky, and I admire Ms Aird for attempting it. Unfortunately, I am disappointed in the results. (I guess Ms Aird was also; it's been only series books from then on.)As in the series books, we get good characters, a sustainable plot, and a hefty dose of humor. The solution of the 150 year-old murder develops nicely step by step. The solution of the present-day murder is awkward. We really don't get much information at all except that the prime suspect (who is evading the police) knows who the real killer is; and then the trapping of the real murderer and explanation of the motive come in a rush."
4,Oddly addicting,"Scary? No - fake documentary, yes. Take the assumption that zombies, from low function and almost feral, to high function that can almost pass --and a movie idea, is born (or unborn, as it may be). First, you really gotta like what they call Mockumentary just for the twist they have fun putting on a thing like that, and I do. I liked it, good plot out and nicely set up, I felt well and realistically acted - and I will pop it in from time to time and find it a nice way to kill a few hours and still keeps me entertained. One of the nice things about the expanding Independant film world is that you get these little oddities, that you will find faves, and they will just stick with you."
3,i liked it.,I found it to be a creative interesting concept. i just feel that such a unique plot shouldve been pushed much further than the subtle direction it took. The film does leave you thinking......were the zombies convinced they were normal or were they just trying to convince others? All and all they end up being exactly what you perceive them to be.
2,"CLEVER, ORIGINAL, AND LOUSY","This is a mockumentary on the zombie community. In many ways it is a parody on the gay community. Unfortunately in order to capture the feel of a real documentary, the movie is very boring. The low budget made for very few special effects or zombie make-up. The zombies they follow live boring if not pathetic lives. The real action in the movie starts at a festival called ""live dead"" which reminded me of a Grateful Dead parking lot. At this point the movie is well past the half way point. Feel free to tell people the surprise ending."
2,This is not a Zombie Movie.....,"This is a movie about zombies. There is nothing in this film that remotely relates to the genre with the exception of the last 15 minutes. This is another soap box, social commentary or op-ed piece designed to mirror the civil rights debate but with the living impaired. Save your money."
1,Tried to hide? They should have hidden this one better:,"Those looking for the raw noise of a garage band on acid should like this one as that is all that these tracks are, raw and poorly performed. Those who are looking for what they heard on the studio recordings of their first release will be very disappointed. The ""Electric Jug"" which was used so effectively on the band's (in studio) ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" is nothing but the equivalent of a VERY bad scratch across a vinyl album (remember those?). I wish I could say something good, but I can't. This is a disc ""of rare recordings of the 13th Floor Elevators"" which is one they should have left in the vault----- very,very deep in the vault, well hidden.."
2,WARNING: NOT WHAT 'the title' SAYS!,"I bought this (not on amazon) years ago & while some of the recordings/songs are not bad, these songs are NOT the original studio versions of the great 13TH Floor Elevators' classic garage-psych songs! It's a collection of alternate takes/versions with so-so sound quality. For hardcore fans this might be interesting -- but if you seek the classic (original!) Elevators recordings, look elsewhere.Another warning: Like the great Yardbirds, the Elevators' discography is ALL-OVER-THE-PLACE with assorted ""legalities."""
4,Nclex-RN Review Cards(Medical-Surgical Nursing),"This is a convienient on the go way to study and it fits about anywhere,in purse or bag,covers everything from Med Surg,Maternity,Psych,Peds,however, it does not cover many Pharmacological questions that will also be asked on State Boards.It has a few alternate format questions in it.Overall it is a good study guide."
3,They helped,"I used the flashcards in addition to a combination of NCLEX books. The flashcards were way to easy, so I did not use them as much as my other study aides. I think they were worth buying because they do get you into the frame of mind of thinking a certain way."
3,Wasn't What I Hoped,"There were a couple interesting things in this book, such as his comments when he told his brother he was gay and what another said to him about it also. But other than that I was offended that Bouldrey gently seems to want to tear down ways and rituals and things that are and have been special and important to men throughout many, many generations. He wants to force an 'in your face' acceptance of homosexuality and same sex marriage and because he couldn't keep that opinion out of the book it tainted the subject and slanted it towards a leftish viewpoint. Believe me, machismo still exists despite his wishing certain ways would vanish or become egalitarian."
4,The Unobscure Eco,"Umberto Eco's books are wonderful, but they often ignore the playful side of Eco's personality. Besides being a master of semiotics and trivia, Eco is also a talented humorist, and these essays, taken mostly from his column in an Italian magazine, reveal just that. The essays remind me of Woody Allen's 'Without Feathers', although I think I enjoyed Eco more. With observations on everything from fame to politics to minor personal inconvenience, a wealth of human wit and thought is compounded here in one slim volume. I personally have enjoyed other books of his more, but these essays reveal a side of Eco that his novels don't hide, but do tend to play down."
3,amusing ramblings,Some funny & some thought-provoking essays. But others relevant only to time & place of origin so wasted here.Not really up to expectations from this iconic author.
4,Collection of funny essays 1-4 pages long,"I read this 8 years or so ago and I bought the book to read them again. They are humorous essays on contemporary life. Though they have been written in the 1980s their charm is lasting and for me offer an interesting illustration of how things stay the same.For example, Eco speaks of receiving 'unsolicited faxes' that interfere with his ability to read important faxes. This reminded me of the problem we have with email spam.I find these humorous essays much more entertaining than his novels like Foucault's Pendulum."
5,Great Service and book,I purchased the book and and received it right away. I received an email from seller asking me if it arrived on time. Truly great service. I highly recomend this seller.
2,Ecos essays don't get to the pace,"I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco, and his novels (Rose and Foucault's Pendulum) and I had high hopes for this collection of essays. Eco is very satirical in these essays, sometimes too much so; the satirical and exaggerating style that is combined with very unusual translation style (ancient words that do not reach the nice rhythm of Eco's otherwise great storytellin in his other works) just got me tired of reading this book. These stories just do not entertain me this time.Here and there I was able to find a nice story but only few. Language just doesn't get to its pace, and I also have say that majority of the stories are dated for readers in 2006. Stories about telefaxes, etc. are not relevant anymore. But also the general problem of satirical essays is that they are very much tied to the present day when they're written.Overall, not a bad collection but nowhere near to my expectations."
2,Inelegant design,"I purchased this through Amazon but returned it. I intended to use this with their 3qt 10-inch saute pan. But it is huge! It is not an elegant design for this size pan. All Clad should have designed a screen that matches this pan instead of a one-size-fits-all from 8 inches to 13 inches. Furthermore, the unique handle that curves over the screen takes more storage room. My wife didn't like it. Back to the drawing boards All-Clad."
1,Holes too big,"The holes are too big and it created a huge mess. The lid is too large to store anywhere it a small kitchen. After one use, I returned it!"
5,All Clad Splatter Screen,I have been purchasing All Clad products for many years for home use. I have also been a professional chef for many years and have come to rely on a couple of quality products and one of them is All Clad. After reading the reviews I was skeptical about order the splatter screen but went forward and order the screen anyway knowing my past experiences with All Clad. I can say that I am very happy I ordered the screen. It is stronger in construction than the cheep ones and the design is a little funky but I hang the screen from my pot rack with the handle over the rack. My stove area is a lot cleaner and the area around my stove is a lot cleaner (without grease)by using the splatter screen.
4,Great Buy,"This cd has most of Cecilia's best work. Especially the song Destination, that one was one of my favorite. This is definitely one that is worth spending your money on."
2,Ice cube maker,"Save your money. The ideal is good, but does not work as well as you would think. Using the fill opening in the top, you can not judge the amount of water in the cube tray."
4,Beautiful china,"The china is beautiful and arrived very quickly after it was ordered and very much in time to be given as a wedding gift! My only reservation is that the shipping packaging was taped sloppy. Only one piece of packing tape was used to tape on each side of the box, and that one piece did not catch both flaps all the way to where the box was ready to fall open when it arrived. For such an expensive product, they should have taken more care with packing it to ship."
3,Outstanding Steel Pan Artist,"Liam is an (if not THE) outstanding steel pan artist. This album shows some of his talent, combining original covers of songs by others and Liam's own compositions. It is a good introduction to this wonderful artist.However, I find the album a little discontinuous, and not quite up to the standards of one of his live performances. It was recorded quite a few years ago, and shows what a prodigy he was at that time. Some of the tunes are traditional, and others tend more towards jazz and improv.This was Mr. Teague's first album and a good sample of his skills, if you like steel pan you won't be disapointed."
1,LRM2060 Microwave,"Upon initial purchase I loved it. It was huge, beautiful and lots of settings. However, product lasted less than 1 week before it died !"
1,LG LRM2060ST,"Our Lg microwave died after two years. Same problem with magnatron going bad. I think that a microwave should last more than two years. LG won't do anything after normal 1 year warranty period. As for Consumer reports, I wouldn't rely on their tests very much."
4,ADORABLE!,"Everyone who sees this clock hanging in my daughter's room loves it. the only downfall would be the 13 nail holes required to hang up each seperate piece of the clock. They're small nails, so it will be easy to cover with spackling. But it won't be worth moving once a location for it is chosen."
4,paid for the clock,"when we were installing the clock, we had a very difficult time. when we were done, we found the paper that should have made everything easy between the card stocks. so make sure you look for the clock installations first. on another note, the clothes are real cute but too small for regular barbies. we don't have ""fashion fever"" dolls, so most of our barbie dolls use the outfits with the velcros unattached :(."
5,Great fun for parent and child,"This is just what most children want in a favorite book; a humorous story and hysterical illustrations. Hilda Mae Heifer lost her moo, how can she discover the sound she is supposed to make? This is the story of how she lost her moo, her attempts to find out what sound a cow is supposed to make, and how Hilda Mae Heifer got her moo back. ""Moo Who?"" is highly recommended for a laugh out loud time with your child."
3,not exactly as described...,"I am happy with the bags though they did not have the closure flap as described. They are exactly large enough for an 8x10 with a flat opening at the top. There is no method to close the bag so it does not do well for long term storage.Clarity is good though I would not call it crystal clear.It is a thick plastic, does the job of protecting though you need to watch to make sure you art does not slip out.I used it for matted art and the matt fits tight in the bag so there is no slipping."
3,"Great Game,but after a while boring!","I bought this game,the first 2 weeks i didn't seperate from it,but after this 2 weeks it bored. De streets are always the same.The missions and cars are good,you can hit everything and the car is after a while wrecked and so.The graphics are excellent.For people that always love to ride on the same location is this a great game.Those people must buy this game for sure.But people that want to have different locations,let the game in the store."
2,Comes Close but Veers off the Road,"This popular title has a lot going for it - good graphics, excellent maneuvering and physics, and style to boot.However, the difficulty is much too high for even heardcore gamers. There seems to be something truly amiss with the makers of the game - despite the negative comments regarding gameplay, the game's sequel, Driver 2 (PSX) is actually harder than the original.In order to make the game playable, you either have to apply a patch released by Infrogrames or play in cheat mode. Then it will become only _barely_ playable.Unless you can find a cheap copy, avoid."
5,Great product!!,"This is some very nice memory. Crucial offers an outstanding product. Crucial has some of the fastest most powerful memory available to speed up your system. The website itself can tell you exactly what memory is right for your system. Ive never heard of anyone reporting memory conflicts with Crucial. I've just replaced my Kingston memory (that half of wasn't even showing up or being recognized) with the Crucial Ballistix Kit and my system immediately recognized the full amount and is running like a Bat out of hell. My current config is an Intel E6600 on the Intel DG965WH Motherboard; with 2 Western Digital SE 16 500 Hard Drives, & the Vista Home Premium 64 OS. 1 Nvidia 8800 GTS, 1 Nvidia 8600 GTS GPU ""SLI""; and the Creative Labs SondBlaster X-FI Fatality 1. Now with 4 GB's of Crucial memory. I'm extremly impressed and very happy."
2,Nextar MP3,"Ok performance, but very very poor ripping software. You get what you pay for with this Nextar MA933A-2BL player."
5,It Seems Awesome!!!,This mp3 player seems awsome for the rpice plus free shipping i bot it and cant wate for it to arrive at my house!!!!!!!
4,A Great Toy!,"This is a great item for any lover of dogs, especially little kids! The toy is very cute, and most people will be turned on by its neat actions, lasting appeal, and unique look. The pug from The Dog series is the cutest one. The only problem is sometimes a lack of interest or durability issues, but this is a great toy to have!"
1,I am angry,I ordered this a month ago and still have not received it! Where is it ??? This was a gift for my husband along with a mezuzah which did arriveand was very nice.
4,This book is great on describing how becoming a teen feels.,This book helped me to understand the way a guy thinks when becoming a teen and also how to talk to them and maybe even start a relationship. I read this in sixth grade and think every parent should get this for their son/daughter.
3,not happy,the vent shed fit my 2002 4 runner but the screws they ship with it to hold it on to the truck are to small to hold the piece on
5,Funny and streaming,"Stand-up Season 7 has a great collection of comics, often before they were famous enough for a full special. These are commercial free and excellent quality."
2,It is fine but I don't use it,"The product is fine and well made for a simple little filter holder but I never actually use it. It turns out that, for me, putting the filters in my camera bag without the holder works well so this purchase was somewhat pointless. I tried to use it at first but could never tell which filter I was pulling out so after a short time, I simply never put the filters back in."
2,Pretty but not very functional,"I received these as a christmas gift and I am not very impressed with them. they get 2 stars for being pretty but thats about it. The salt and pepper is hard to get out of these shakers and when you do happen to get it out, it goes everywhere but where you need it. I just bought some off E-bay for $4.99 because I couldnt stand these anymore!!"
4,Great Guide,This book has just about all of the info you need to fish in SoCal. It has everything from bait suggestions to the best times to cath certain fish to the actual spots where you are most likely to catch them. This is a must for fishermen new to Southern California.
3,"Nice, but repeatitive","I loved the boys choir, young mail soprano's always did have a haunting quality to their voice that I admire and adore...but it seemed as if the same notes where being sung...it was too repetive for my tase...same notes..same tempo, just differnt words.."
5,Fraud detection,I loved this book and found it difficult to put down. I purchased it for a class I'm taking but I've already read it cover to cover before the first class.
3,"Not the Best, But Good","As a college-level lecturer in Forensic Accounting, I seriously considered using this book, but decided not to. While it is clearly the most readable book in the area of forensic accounting, it is lean on examples and does not include citations to the cases and other materials it describes.A far better, though more difficult, book on the narrow subject of financial fraud isThe Financial Numbers Game: Detecting Creative Accounting Practicesand a better book on Forensic Accounting generally isForensic and Investigative Accounting (Third Edition).In any event, you'll be better off avoidingFraud Examination (with ACL CD-ROM), which spends most of its time (i.e., your time) moralizing and psychoanalyzing those who commit fraud."
4,Good kickoff-book for financial analysts,"This book is a good starting point for financial analysts. Some common tricks of clever accountants are illustrated in this book. However, the book does not offer too many in depth analysis and due to its publishing date (1993) it does not include recent developments. I would recommend waiting for the next edition - will be coming out March 22nd."
4,Good entry Fin Accounting read.,"This is a good read for someone who needs a refersher on balance sheet antics. It does contain some good real-life examples that are easy to understand (if you don't remember them happening). It is a pretty quick read that gives a high lever overview of fraud tatics. I would put this as a first year grad student accounting book.One dislike, not all applications mentioned in this book can be detected by just viewing a balance sheet. Some require some in-depth research, and time. Its easy to say a stock is a dog after the fact.It does give a bit of insight to those looking for stocks to short."
4,Investor Beware,"This book shows how GAAP rules can be twisted to mask poor financial performance and boost the price of stock. Among the tricks exposed: shifting revenue from one period to another; taking losses at convenient times; and manipulating depreciation schedules to minimize expenses. Each trick is illustrated with real-world examples drawn from SEC cases and civil litigation. I enjoyed the book very much: it's short, readable, and wise. I did, however, wonder about what audience the author was trying to reach. Accountants and financial analysts will already know these tricks and regard the exposition as superficial; on the other hand, readers with no business background at all might be daunted by the accounting technicalities. Probably the ideal reader is a hobbyist-investor who reads business books for pleasure. For such readers, ""Financial Shenanigans"" offers pleasures galore."
4,Know more about tricky accounting technique,"For those who have taken ACCT 101, there is a good book to learn accounting tricky in detail. This book could be better if changed its text book style, although this makes readers easier to read, a bit boring. The example are not very good as most of the analyzed companies are not well known.Still, worth to read."
2,"Great Idea, But Not Very Filling.","The concept is obviously worthwhile, but this book is not nearly as useful as it might be. What's most annoying about ""Financial Shenanigans"" is the author's habit of showing a large graph of a stock's price at the time a particular shenanigan is detected by the investing public (can you say ""book filler shenanigan""?), instead of providing an illustration from an actual financial statement. The author has a sloppy inclination for sketchiness and over-generalization when the subject cries for careful detail. ""Financial Warnings"" by Charles Mulford, is quite a bit more methodical and clear, even for the novice forensic accountant."
5,Howard Schilit is the best in the business,Financial Shenanigans was required reading at the first hedge fund that I worked at. I now keep a copy in my office and use it for reference. This book is written in simple language that allows the novice to benefit from the insights of a true industry professional. Many mutual funds and hedge funds subscribe to Howard's institutional research service because of the quality of his work. This book helps level the playing field for individual investors. It helps by explaining medthods that investment professionals use to find corporations that mask poor financial performance.
3,Could have been a trifle better,"Just finished the kindle edition last night. I will admit I couldn't put it down, but many of the pages I skimmed over. The story is good, and I would have liked to see more interaction between the Major, the lady and the Captain as opposed to trying to sound out a lot of the southern drawl words as I read them. It was an interesting read, and I'll give it a 3 star rating. I've read better, and definitely read worse."
4,SEGRESSION......RIP IT UP WITH THE BEST,"Segression 3rd release SMILE is a goog follow-up to the their 2nd KILLER album 5th of the 5th. From the opening tracks haunting harmonized guitar, Dr A Hype slams home with a crushing riff that tops it with any HEAVY metal band. Segression have opened for many headline acts in Australia like ,PANTERA, SLIPKNOT, SEPULTURA and SLAYER, and if you like any of these bands you will love SEGRESSION. Their debut album L.I.A is raw, heavy and will tear your f..king head off. So buy SMILE, if you like it get hold of their first 2 albums, which can be bought at their website www.segression.com.au......."
5,A must for the music business,"If you are an aspiring or existing artist or band looking to make headway in the music business, this book is a must-have. It is the roadmap to success. You cannot get where you are going unless you know how to get there."
4,Import/Export: How to Get Started in International Trade,This was a very informative book if just a bit dated (Some of the contact information included was at the World Trade Centers in NYC). Other than that the book was very good in detailing the process for starting the business. It was paticularly good in the explanation of creating a unit price for the product addressing several areas which I had not considered. This book is written in an intellegent manor for people who have some understanding of business but need help in gaining specific industry knowledge.
2,Too basic,This book is definately for the beginner and was of no use to me. I have only been working as an importer for about a year and found the book useless. I would recommend it only for the novice. If you have any experience at all you have already heard this information.
1,DOA,The plants were dead on arrival. They were dried out down to the roots. I also bought the seeds but have not planted them yet.
1,DOA,"My mother said if you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all, but my lemon grass plant was dead on arrival. I can't say if the shipper or the supplier caused it's demise but one way or another it was very,very DEAD!"
5,Makes amazing tea,I grew up up on a tropical island where lemongrass grew in our garden. We never cooked with it like the Thai but we made tea. Recently my mom started addind some basil to that tea. It's a must try!!!
1,Lemon Grass Plant,"I did not have good luck with this product. It arrived postage due ($1.90) and because of my schedule the unfortunate plant had to sit in its' box at the post office for an additional 2 days. I brought it home, watered and placed it in a warm sunny windowsill. Today it is still mostly brown and dead with a small green sprout, but I don't think it will bounce back."
2,lemon grass plants,"One plant deceased, the other barely hanging on. Post office misplaced packagefor several days so it was without light and water for longer than expected. Notthe fault of the company purchased from!"
4,Lemon Grass,The plant arrived safely with great instructions. It was ample size and incredibly healthy!!! I couldn't be more satisfied!
3,low quality video,THe content on this DVD is pretty good...but much of the video looks like a dupe? blurry and very second or third generation...even the widescreen interviews..PLUS...I can NOT for the life of me find the 48 minute THREE DOG NIGHT concert it references in the notes or the jacket....it must be the best hidden easter egg of all time.....bottom line..infuriating....but worth $7
5,chcuk negron is an example of gods love,chuck i commend you on telling your story . hopefully it will help others to either stop using drugs or not start.people tend to think being a star is all peaches and cream. you definitely show the down sound. you also show that drugs can be overcome. i am not a drug expert but when someone is on drugs as long as you were i doubt they normally ever make it back. may god bless and keep you and yours.
5,Medieval Mysteries,Medieval mysteries become medieval masterpieces powered by the deft acting of Derek Jacobi. This series will satisfy anyone seeking a delightful journey into medieval England. Shropshire and its culture emerge vividly from the talented cast and crew. Highly recommended.
3,Cadfael-Set One,The Cadfael stories are interesting and Derek Jacoby is very good as Cadfael but the setting and time period seem very depressing. The whole atmosphere is kind of gloomy and the music adds to this. I wouldn't want to have lived in that era. One Corpse Too Many was too violent for my taste but overall I enjoyed these mysteries.
5,"Should be a classic, classic guitar album","I have never heard anything before from composer Mangore and nothing from this performer Ramirez either but if you like classic, postromantic/modern style classic guitar this is highly recommended becuase it has nice music and it is performed very lyrical in mellow Paraguay style (even if the player is from Peru he probably, in that lyrical Paraguyan style, is true to the composers intentions).This is a relaxing disc and very good music well played. I am happy, grabbing this one by chance, that I did so.Highly recommended"
5,The Buñuelian irreverence!,"Once more the prodigal son of Calanda makes a very intelligent and carefully satire, cynical and ironic gaze about the religion and its collateral implications when decides to make an extraordinary semblance about certain dogmatic incoherencies and insane behavior as the funny sequence in which Jesus decides to cut his hair but Maria avoids it as any fashion adviser, or the use of nut who assumes the role of a priest discussing about religion in a miserable bar through a true tour de force script. A road movie that will lead us to Santiago de Compostela and besides will interweave past and present where out of mind characters who will make you laugh and reflect. Not for squeamish tastes or sensible spirits.A giant film along the way."
1,Not satisfied,"This movie was not the one I asked: the title is the same but it is not the correct movie. In fact I ordered ""Milky Way"" by Luis Bunuel, but was sent ""The Milky Way"" by Ali Nassar, in arabic and israeli with english subtitles. Fortunately the DVD with ""Milky Way"" by Bunuel was perfectly enjoyable (as I specified in my previous review), so I will try to see this israeli movie."
2,It's poor written,"It's basically a very poor written book, especially compared to the famous Todd's CCNA book. You can easily find a lot of much better written and easier understood articles on the Internet than in this book on same topics. It just simply hurts the repution of Sybex in my opinion."
2,Too unclear to follow,I bought this book because I loved his CCNA one. But this book just turned out to be too difficult to follow: too many unclear expressions. You need another book before reading this one. I dont recoomend you to buy this one if you are new to BSCI.
2,Not a good prep for the exam,I used and liked the Sybex books by Todd Lammle to study for my CCNA so naturally I started with this book when I decided I wanted to get my CCNP. The book has alot of good technical information but was not good prep for the test. I knew the book inside and out and was doing extremely well on the sample questions/scenarios. I felt completely lost during the test and was suprised to find that I had actually passed. This book has emphasis on the wrong areas and leaves some things out completely. I usually don't take the time to write reviews but I dislike this book strongly.
5,Carl Timm really pulls it together,"Carl Timm who wrote most of this book and will write the updated 642 test version really knows this material. The preparatory reading from this book and Timm's style of writing (that is often credited elsewhere) really prepared me for the hardest of the CCNP tests. This is a crucial exam and topic as it covers material required for the BSCI test required for the CCNP, CCDP, CCIP and is good prep heading into the CCIE R&S. While I had critical experience in the field with this technology, the material is presented very well and is a great prep for the exam. The key is to read this material and understand it. This will not cram you for the exam, but lays the groundwork for better understanding of the topics which will carry you further than just passing the test. If you can correctly answer the practice questions throughout the book, you will demonstrate your command of the material (and pass the test)."
4,An important contribution to the polygamy debate,"The value of this book is that the Kenyan author is able to describe how polygamy functions in a society where it has long been traditional. Author Maillu describes the benefits that flow from polygamy, as well as the problems that arise, and how traditional African society deals with them. There is much shrewd practical advice in this book. Especially interesting is the association of polygamy with what we would call ""traditional moral values""--ie extended family, respect for elders, that sort of thing. Polygamy in Africa is not an ""alternative lifestyle"". The author also looks at modern Africa, under pressure to adopt Western ways. But traditional Africa, he says, has its own wisdom, which is often superior to that of the West. He calls upon his countrymen to take more pride in African ways, to affirm their africanness.And we non-Africans? We too, could learn a thing or two. This book offers unique insights into an interesting subject."
3,Good effort,"A previous reviewer has already given a synopsis of this book. The book belongs in the libraries of high schools and junior colleges, and would be a worthy addition there. It is relatively non-technical, and perhaps inevitably so, as the authors are not professional mathematicians, but rather ""mathematics educators.""A faster, more technical, and more complete work is, ""Pi Unleashed"", by Arndt and Haenel, and published by Springer (ISBN 3540665722)."
1,Measurement,The measurement is not right on this. Its more like a 11x14. I was not pleased at all. the picture is good but would not fit in the frame I got .
2,Sleeping Dogs,"Even though I have not received the picture yet, I had to let others know that this company (Poster Revolution not Amazon) DOES NOT tell you up front that that they do not ship the product as stated! So, you have to investigate the situation to find out where your package is....hence you can not be a SLEEPING DOG!Hopefully the picture will make up for the poor customer service."
3,Not one of his best.,"This book starts off quite good, but then veers off intodirections that in my opinion totally make no real sense ofwhat the author had set up. not a bad read, but not great."
2,Constant Connection Problems,I have bluetooth built in to my laptop (Dell Inspiron 9300) and I haven't had problems with anything except for this keyboard and mouse. The mouse works fine except that it's kind of jumpy. The keyboard requires me to go through the bluetooth reinstall process every couple days.I've given up on these products. I'll wait a couple years until the bugs are out.
4,Easy to install and good operation,"I purchased this set as a companion to a new notebook with built-in bluetooth. The keyboard and mouse stay at the office while the notebook goes everyehere I go. The product was easy to install and operates well without any delays or slow response. I also like the feel of the keyboard, many are too soft or too ""clicky"" this one feels just right."
4,4 star decktop,"Almost everything works just fine for me. My only problem is I have hard time seeing the keyboard letters. The room light reflects off the board and I have to sit back to see the letters. Other than that, it's good."
3,Great....when it works,"Both the keyboard and mouse are comfortable and work well when connected. The problem is that the connections break way too easily and are often difficult to reestablish. I thought it might be that I was using the laptop's integrated Bluetooth but using the supplied USB dongle instead fairs no better.The mouse was so problematic that I gave up and went back to a wired mouse. The keyboard disconnects after a few minutes of inactivity and reconnecting often takes several attempts manually through the Bluetooth Manager, in many cases having to remove the batteries in the keyboard and reinstall them to get it to connect. This is not a battery issue as the same batteries will then continue to work for days.It seems that all the improvements in mice have been focused on bluetooth wireless products. I can't find a 'state of the art' wired mouse and this experience has made me hesitant to even consider another bluetooth mouse or keyboard."
2,keyboard won't work,"The mouse works great! The keyboard will sync, but only works for a few seconds before it cuts out! Have re-synced several times and my new laptop says it recognizes it, but it still will not work."
5,goog,"being that it uses bluetooth for connection it should be better than other regular wireless desktops out there.Cons:cannot access the bios at startup BUT there is a solution1. Go to your bluetooth settings and look for the option ""Turn discovery on"" and check that.2. You must use a passkey for the keyboard.After you do this entering the bios with the keyboard should work"
4,"Solid - not incredible, but solid","The product itself is great - once you get to used to it. Keyboard feels like it can take a beating, the faux-leather handrest is very comfortable, and the mouse has a nice feel to it (unless you've got small hands). No problems with Vista x64.One caveat: don't bother w/ MS's Intellipoint software/drivers for the mouse. It'll making using the mouse a chore. If you use Winamp, it will NOT scroll down if Intellipoint is installed. That's just the biggest bug; there are many more nuisances, including erratic and inaccurate scrolling. Not the hardware, it's the software. Intellitype for the keyboard is fine, even useful.Overall, as long as you don't care about customizing what the mouse buttons do (yes, the side ones work fine as forward/back functions w/o the software), then this is a good k/m set. If you do care, then get Logitech; while their software is bloated as well, it at least works."
4,"BAD FOR OCer's, good looking item w/ quality control issues","FIRST OFF, AND MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE: THE KEYBOARD IS NOT FOR OVERCLOCKERS OR SYSTEM TWEAKERS AS I COULDN'T ENTER THE BIOS USING IT. I GUESS THE DRIVERS AREN'T LOADED SOON ENOUGH?Besides that, I love the way this looks and feels. The palm rest is not detachable like they have been in the past, but it isn't a problem for me since it is very nice. The mouse is a little different than my previous microsoft wireless optical mouse. There seems to be a little less control and the scroll wheel is a lot more sensitive and hard to control. I have to return mine because the space bar squeaks terribly and loudly. It is very annoying to even type this review it is so loud! This is definately going back for a replacement. Can't wait to get my new one."
3,Nice keyboard but far from perfect,"First of all this thing is really big...huge. It's also somewhat thick. I also had experienced a problem connecting it first time, and there is a delay a few milliseconds from time to time.However I like the keyboard, the keys are very nice and all those extra shortcuts buttons come very handy.The bottom line, if one can spend an extra few dollars, I think the Logitech would be a better investment."
3,"Love the keyboard, mouse was unresponsive.","I bought this unit because of the keyboard. All the buttons, where I want them. Lots of flexibility. Customizable per user. It was easy to install and works great.However, I had trouble with the mouse. It installed easily, but was always acting unresponsive. Not sure if this was a problem with the power management in the mouse, or with the bluetooth connection (which works fine for the keyboard).Anyway, I've kept the combo and switched back to my previous non-bluetooth wireless mouse. This is working fine, though of course it eats up another USB port.BTW, the keyboard is HUGE. If you've got space limitations--maybe a keyboard drawer or limited desk space, make sure you look at the dimensions first."
2,Extremely laggy mouse,"I bought this keyboard/mouse set hoping to consolidate most of my wireless devices onto a single HUB and standard.Setting up the set was easy enough in Windows, but I immediately found that the mouse did not work well at all. The cursor would move in increments of around 10 pixels at a time. I even put the Bluetooth adapter on a USB extension cord and placed it within inches of the mouse, but that didn't help at all.The keyboard seemed to work well, but I didn't use it for very long because the mouse was unbearable to use. I have several wireless networks in my area, which may be causing interference with the Bluetooh though."
3,Not all that it could be,"The instructions that come with this keyboard assume that you are connecting to a laptop or desktop without built in bluetooth and there are no instructions for connecting without the bluetooth USB attachment. In addition, there is no additional help information nor a phone number for Microsoft product support.The built in buttons for shortcuts are very useful, but many of them require custom designation and then there is no apparent way to remember what each button is programmed to do."
1,constant disconnects,"The keyboard and mouse constantly disconnect from the computer (Vista). You have to go through the whole process of pairing the devices, and even then often the computer won't recognize the keyboard and/or mouse. Bottom line: it's useless."
3,Question about the price,"I do not own this yet, but would like to buy it.However, why are you charging $340.00 for an item that Microsoft lists for $130.00?Something is JUST NOT RIGHT here!!! I've been looking for a decent keyboard for over a year. Logitech should burn in hell. Microsoft seems to be good...but not for $340!!??"
1,Get something else,I got this keyboard with very high hopes. Unfortunately my experience was really bad. The keyboard worked most of the time and the mouse not at all. Tried all the technical things the help wizard had me do but the mouse still would not work. Once my frustration level had passed the boiling point I tried to call Microsoft technical support. Of course they don't offer an 800 number support number; if you want that you have to pay. Spent an hour waiting for a Microsoft tech and eventually just gave up and returned it back to Amazon. Also the fact that you need another keyboard and mouse in order to install this one is really stupid.
4,Note your model number!,"Its funny that reviews are by nature open to mistakes. The review that the Aussie left certainly shows the way this works. Microsoft sold the M54-00001 bluetooth desktop set for quite a while, and there was quite a stir about problems, such as you read here. All those were called back from the stores and replaced with the updated (and now current) M54-00013 version which is soooo much better! The new one has been out only a few months, and the Aussie had his for 1.5 years! The bluetooth adapter is better, the timing is better, etc. The M54-00001's and other of their early kin are still available on pricewatch. They are much cheaper. STAY AWAY FRIM THAT MODEL!!! Instead, go for the updated M54-00013 instead. You'll be glad you did, because it has the feel of a professional keyboard with lots of bells and whistles. For more info, check Microsoft's web page (and read the fine print). Its too bad the name didn't change. My bet is that they were afraid of returns and exchanges."
3,Solid choice but beware,"The keyboard and mouse work well when functional, but there are a few fundamental flaws in the design:1) The connect/disconnect button on the keyboard is in a very prominent spot and is easily hit, once you hit it the Bluetooth connection has to be reconfigured which can be a hassle.2) The computer does not always recognize the mouse when it first boots, this can be very annoying because you have to go get another mouse to reconfigure.3) After about a week of use the scroll wheel on my keyboard was pushed in, I recently went to an electronics store and saw the same thing on this model so I assume this is commonThese are all minor problems and I would recommend this product because the rage and ease of use can not be beat, just beware of what you are getting into before expecting perfection. After all I expected perfection should be what you get for the price I paid."
1,Not a good experience,I bought this product because I wanted to try bluetooth for a change. After a few days the keyboard started dropping out and had to be reinstalled several times. After a week of this it failed altogether and wouldn't be recognized by my system any more. The mouse continued to work fine. Amazon sent me a replacement very quickly. The keyboard on that one started dropping out after four days. That's enough for me. There's something seriously wrong with this product.
1,Doesn't use existing bluetooth,"I bought this and am now returning it. The documentation says you have to use the included bluetooth transceiver (USB). It says there are only a few Microsoft devices that this is true for, but this mouse/keyboard are on the list. My laptop already has bluetooth and I don't want to have to take care of one more thing. Of course, I did try to ignore the documentation and just use my laptop's bluetooth. It was unable to even see the mouse. It was able to see the keyboard, but unable to initialize it. It does feel like a very nice mouse/keyboard -- if you don't mind the USB dongle, then feel free to buy it. Just don't buy it expecting to use your existing bluetooth connection."
3,Keyboard eats batteries,"I put lithium batteries in both the mouse and keyboard when I got them back in March 2007. I have replaced the keyboard batteries 3 times, and 0 times for the mouse!!!Keyboard also loses connection sometimes when I'm using it. I would expect this to be a bit more consistent. My wireless keyboard from Kensington for my other PC has none of these issues."
2,Randomly looses connection...,"The mouse or keyboard, but usually keyboard, randomly disconnects. It still shows the device in ""Bluetooth Devices"" but it the pointer won't move (mouse) or you can't type (keyboard). I've called Microsoft twice on the issue and they seem to be clueless about a solution. I've tried using this set on Windows XP, Windows 7 and three different computers with the latest version of their software.Microsoft decide the unit is defective and is sending me a Laser 7000 (that's the reason for 2 stars -- they're standing behind their products.)"
5,Fantastic Kinks bio,"A fantastic general biography of The Kinks that features numerous photos (some rare)... Now out of print, the book has become one of the most sought after items among Kinks enthusiasts as well as serious rock music fans..."
4,Separate but Equal (kdl try),"The movie "" Separate but Equal"" was a good movie, but is extremely long. During the movie, it bought out many good points and showed how far the United States have come from the beginning of our nation until now. The movie showed how blacks, and whites could not go to the same school. So, instead of the blacks compromising with the little the whites were going to give them, they decided to go to court. All the peoople that rebelled in Clarenton County of South Carolina were fired, or either threated. After fighting for about two to three years, the NAACP, won the case in the supreme court to have desegregation. Although the case was won, it took a few years for the schools to come together. I would recommend somenone to look at this movie, because it teaches you a lot about history. It also helps you to understand how far we have come no matter what denomination you are."
5,Great historical/legal drama,"I thoroughly enjoyed this historical dama about Briggs v. Elliott. It was a great drama, seemed very accurate, portrayed a little-known legal ""Super Bowl"" between my hero, John W Davis, and Thurgood Marshall. Everybody should watch it."
5,TImeless!,this Film is Timeless Why You Might Ask? Because Not Much has Really CHanged.this Film is Very Well Acted&DIrected Very Strongly.this Film Deals with the Battle FOr Justice&Equality which is still a Fight to this day.this FIlm Should have Gotten More Juice it's A Timeless Classic.A Must See for Not only as a Film but also History.
1,stick with the standard,this controller is terrificly awful. i got it for X-mas last year and totally regret it. yes it does look cool but so do lots and lots of other WELL MADE controllers. it cant seem to find the right spot in your hand and its trigger buttons feel akward. the best controller is found else where.
2,Crummy controller,The thing works but it feels weird. the plastic is cheap. I don't think my hands are small but the controller doesn't feel comfortably proportioned.
2,Beware..junk,Cheaply made and rushed onto the market. The analog stick gets stuck and it is very akward feeling. Try another controller because you will wish you had.
4,Great songs,"This CD contains music from one of the best ever Broadway musicals, and also from one of the silliest ever.""The King and I"" is universally acclaimed, and Yul Brenner was highly regarded for his performance of the King on both stage and screen.What ""The King and I"" did for Siam, ""Kismet"" failed to do for the land of Sultans. The movie was close to insulting to that culture. However, the songs were entertaining. In a way they may be better on the CD, because you can take the songs as they are and miss all the silliness that surrounds them in the play and the movie. It did provide the wonderful ""Strangers in Paradise"", an all time standard. Many other tracks from Kismet are not so memorable, however.The King and I provides ""Whistle a Happy Tune"", ""Hello, Young Lovers"", ""Getting to Know You"", and the famous ""Shall We Dance"" ... among other pleasant and often amusing songs.This is a pleasant enough CD, but I recommend that you find a bargain on it, and not pay full price."
4,A book that younger children may not appreciate...,"I think adults may appreciate this one more than the children will. I've attempted to read it to my younger sisters (ages 4 and 6) and they're just not into it. It's a beautifully illustrated book with an interesting and tragic story, and you might want to save it for those a little older."
3,Interesting book but not a keeper,"There wasn't much to the story, the art work is nice but not compelling. Still overall it was good. Amazon shipped in an envelope instead of hard packaging to it arrived slightly damaged. It got donated to the library book sale."
3,has it done the trick?,"seems to have worked, but it's hard to say. We still have occasional glitches with DVDs, but less than before. Who's to say whether it's the player or a scratched DVD??? The verdict's still out."
1,Doesn't work on my DVD players,"None of my three DVD players (Sony, Magnavox, Proscan) will read the lens-cleaner disk. When I try to play it, I get either a ""can't read"" message (Sony) or a strange sound as if the player is trying, but unsuccessfully, to play the disk. I tried to run a replacement disk. Same result. A DVD player at Wal-Mart, where I had purchased the disk, played the disk without difficulty. Three different employees professed mystification at the inability of my DVD players to read the disk. Since the box containing the disk has no Maxell telephone number on it, I can't (as I would like) call Maxell to get their take on the problem. I feel ripped off."
1,Does Not Work on ALL DVD Players,"First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself. I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it:(1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung. Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond. I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time.(2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well. Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close. On the 3rd attempt it actually did work.(3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying ""no disk"".I consider it item a waste of money."
1,Can't find anything that will read it,"I've tried this cleaner in everything that I can put it into in my house (2 DVD players, 2 CD players, and 2 DVDrom drives on the computer)and haven't had anything read it yet. It either says ""NO DISC"" or just keeps spinning trying to read it. Sure will be easy to return I hope."
1,It Didn't Work In My DVD Players Either,"I had an older version of this product which worked in our DVD players, but this one doesn't work. The players can't read the disc. I also noted that the amount of bristles on this disc are fewer than the amount of bristles on their older version."
3,"Worth a try, but don't get your hopes up","I have two DVD players, one with moderate use, the other with very light use. Both ended up skipping and locking up - the typical dust problem. Neither was helped by this product - the same experience I have had with other ""cleaners."" Save the money, just buy a new player. The cost of one of these things is 1/3 of the way there for the low-end DVD player these days."
3,Maxell DVD lens cleaner,"Purchased this video cleaner and cannot load into one of my DVD players; receive disc error message: playback on this disc is not available. Really not sure what this means, but won't function on this player. Does function on otherDVD recorder/player????"
1,Crap,This disc could not be read in either of my DVD players. Refund requested. Would not pruchase this item. Do not buy!
1,Maxwell was Totally Useless..purchased at Amazon,"It wouldn't move in either of my DVD players and I tried it about 30 times on both of them. At least with the Memorex, I got sound, although no video."
2,ok,"this item works on DVD and game systems only, it won't do anything on a CD player. It is very expensive compared to others I saw and just exactly the same."
1,Dont Waste Your Money!!!,"If your considering the purchase of this based on the previous reputation of Maxell, think again. This DVD seems to have a mind of it's own as to whether it activates once you place it into your DVD player. If you do end up with the screen prompts don't consider yourself one of the lucky few! It does not possess the quality or capability to properly clean the DVD laser in the very least! Complete and utter junk.Fools rush in, were wise men never go..."
5,It works!,"i was thinking i may need a new dvd player since it's always frozen, but i'd like to give this product a try, guess what, it works! now it plays smooth and great! thanks!"
2,Thin and flimsy.,"These may work for some baseball cards that you put in and leave alone. I purchased them to organize coupons, so I am constantly taking items out and putting items in and taking them out. The pockets are tearing."
4,baseball card sleeves,"The product arrived in good condition, but took a few extras days for delivery. I ordered during Christmas rush, so mail may have been slow, but I did pay extra for expedited shipping."
5,9 Pocket Page Protectors,"I was very pleased with this product. Worked great for most all coupons. Some had to be folded on the ends, but picture/description of product was still visible."
5,coupon pockets,I have been trying to find pockets to use for my coupons and tried business card holders and they were way too small. So I tried baseball card holders and these work great. Now I have a very well organized coupon notebook.
4,Well made does the job,For anyone will a collection of trading cards there are a must. Keeps card as fresh as the day you got them. This was a gift for my grandson s Pokemon collection
5,Perfect for coupons!,"I was so excited to organize my new coupon binder with these! HOWEVER... I wish I would have purchased at least two more! I am not an ""extreme"" couponer. I only get two newspapers every Sunday... I didn't think I needed more than 25 sheets of these... I DID THOUGH!!! Awesome product, order at least three sets though!"
5,perfect for coupons,"I'm using these for coupons. Have to fold some of them, but it's all good. Works perfectly for my needs."
2,Bad pocket protectors,"The pockets began separating as soon as we began putting in the cards. At first I thought my son was stretching them out too far, but they were doing it to me too. These are very flimsy and very poor quality. I will not be purchasing this brand of protectors again.The seller was good, and the shipping was very timely. They need to get a better product though."
2,25 Ultra Pro 9 Pocket Page Protectors Fits 3-Ring Binder for Baseball and Other Sports Cards!,"I purchased ""25 Ultra Pro 9 Pocket Page Protectors Fits 3-Ring Binder for Baseball and Other Sports Cards and think the product inspection process for quality control needs to be improved. I filled up the pockets of most of the sheets and was happy until discovering that one of the sheets had the holes cut off of it and couldn't be put into my binder. I didn't return the product. I plan on buying my next sheets locally, where I can inpect them for myself. This product is not worth what I paid for it."
5,Great product for couponing,"I purchased the 9 Pocket Page Protectors to store my coupons. They work great for that use. They allow easy visibility, easy access, and they are durable. I will be purchasing more very soon."
4,Using these for couponing!,"No complaints so far! I'm using these for my coupon binder, and they work well. The price was very affordable, and they were shipped out promptly to me."
5,perfect for coupons!,"I ordered these to organize my coupons and have been perfectly happy with them! They are of good quality, and fit wonderfully in a simple three ring binder (I use one that zips up and these do NOT hang over the edge, making zipping difficult) Would definitely recommend!"
5,Grandson gift,Loved them! Needed more sleeves for all his baseball cards and had them filled up before the end of his party.!!
5,Great Product!,Seller was fast responder and sold a great product.All aspects of this transaction was A++.
2,Not big enough,"I got these to put together a ""coupon"" book. They are not long enough or wide enough for most coupons. If you are using it for baseball cards I""m sure it would be great, but for my purposes, not so great."
5,Great for couponing!,I've had these for 9 months and they are durable and perfect for holding coupons! I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Baseball Card Protector into Coupon Book,I ordered these for my coupon binder to keep coupons in order.. just got them so I intend on putting my binder together and putting them to good use!
5,Nice,"I bought these to use for my coupons, along with other sizes! I think they are durable and not a bad price. I haven't had them for long but so far so good!"
5,pocket page protectors,Great product at a very good price. Arrived quickly and in great condition as promised. I would use this vendor again.
5,Great for coupons,"Like many of the reviewers, I bought these pocket protectors to hold my coupons. It makes it easy to see what coupons I have at a glance. I have not had them for long, but so far they are holding up and I they have not caused any concern."
2,Just Awful..,Bought these thinking it looked like a great product but I was completely mistaken. Almost half of the pages pockets are sealed shut or almost sealed shut. The pockets that are partially sealed shut completely rip and look awful if you try to open them. Very disappointed - and when I tried to find a way to contact the seller I couldn't - I could only return the items for a refund. Very unhappy with the transaction and the product.
4,Quality page protectors,"We purchased these page protectors for our son who collects sports cards. He has hauled his binder around to school & church, to show his friends. The pages are sturdy, have clearly visible pockets, & were economically priced. Great value for the price."
4,Good buy,"I bought these to use for coupons. They work great! A few have ripped though, but not enough that I would need to throw them out."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This was exactly what I was looking for! Great quality, it came quickly and was well packaged. Thank you!"
4,ULTRA PRO SILVER POCKET PAGE PROTECTORS,"The pocket page protectors work fine. I use them to store andorganize my Pokemon card collections. They were an excellect buy.In addition to the ones I purchased, Ultra Pro ""Silver"" Type protectors,they make ""platinum"" ones which are more expensive and a bit ""heavier"" intheir construction. A package or less would make a suitable gift for ayoung person who collects cards. Five to ten years ago, boys werethe main collectors of Pokemon cards, but in 2011 girls are activecollectors too."
2,Item received is not the item pictured,"expecting to receive the ultra pro pages with the hologram on the sleve (platinum) as pictured. instead, received ultra pro pages without the hologram (silver). small difference but can throw off your collection."
4,A must for Dominion players,"For Dominion or other card game players) this is a must have. These are are fairly sturdy (hence the 4 stars) sleeves for cards. You need to be careful with the ones on the edges as they tend to tear a bit more easily. But overall these are good sleeves. Over time they do wear down in terms of getting loose, that said they still hold the cards fine but not sure how these would hold up with heavy use."
5,Perfect for keeping cards,"Especially in a 3 ring binder, good for preservation. Easy to use product sent in packaging that was not excessive."
5,9 Pocket Page Protectors,I ordered these to hold coupons for shopping and they work great. Am able to organize and it helps timewise with shopping.
5,great pocket protectors,These came very quickly in the mail. They have worked great for my coupons. Very glad I decided ro purchase these
4,Great value.,"Bought these for my coupon binder, very pleased. They are much sturdier than the ones I purchased locally and cheaper as well. I kept ripping the holes out of my previous ones where these have been holding on strong."
2,Cable frays very quickly,"Took me a while to get used to the shape. You can't wear them with glasses, because they really hurt your ears. They're great for running, but not so good if you're on a rowing machine, because the behind-the-neck band gets in the way. The biggest problem, though, is that the cable gets frayed very quickly (<1 month of daily use) - mine has split in numerous places, so is patched up with band-aids. I'm now looking to buy a replacement pair of SONY headphones..."
4,Good product,"I usually do not like spending a lot for products like this (I believe I spent around $30), however this is a good quality product. Very sturdy, and is great for what is used for. I love to run with it - much better than the pieces that you place in your ear. This thing doesn't even fall off when it's not hanging over my ear. The official video review (i think from cnet) was very helpful in my purchase."
2,Good sound but poor finish,"These stay on your head while running and have good sound, but the left speaker on my set has a raised moulding line in the rubber around the speaker. This moulding line rubs into my ear and gets very uncomfortable after about 10 minutes. No problem on the right ear. I dont know if it is a defect in the manufacturing or if they are all like this."
4,Very good headphones,The only headphones I like are neckband ones. The default straight line headphones provided with mp3 players never stay in my ears during exercise. This one is very good and so far has avoided getting my sweat into the ear piece. The only issue is the fit in my ear; after 30 or 40 minutes it causes little pain in my ear.
4,Great workout headphones.,"I will start by saying I consider myself and audiophile and cant use headphones unless they meet my high standards. I own several pairs of Sennheisers for home stereo use.These phones have a good sound and good bass responce. Although, they have the disadvantage of not sealing like the earplug style phones. They are probably the best ""out of ear"" style I have heard.They will stay in place through any physical workout. Including punching heavy bags, jump rope, etc.One drawback is since they are not the ear plug style they allow sweat to get into your ear canal. This is annoying. But, wasn't a deal breaker for me."
3,Had to update my review,"I liked these headphones but one of the speakers became distorted a few months after using the product. I finally got frustrated and tossed them. I had to bump my rating down from 5 stars to 3.My original review:These headphones stay put in your ear when you run/jump, which was my main criteria when deciding which headphones to purchase. All the other types of headphones I used before would never stay put in my ears when I run, but these do. Plus, the cord is long enough to drop your mp3 player in your pocket, which is where I put mine when I run. I have only had the headphones for a week, but so far they are exactly what I was hoping they would be when I purchased them: a great-sounding pair of headphones that stay put while running/jogging/working out. Something to note, if your ears are sensitive, you might find them slightly uncomfortable after wearing them for longer periods of time. For me, it is not an issue, and a small price to pay for headphones that don't budge."
3,Good sound but a bit tight,"I recently bought the Sennheiser PMX70 headphones to replace my current Sony MDR-J11G headphones that are awkward to manage when doing anything remotely athletic. The PMX70s are much easier to throw on for a run, and there are no worries about them falling out of my ear. My one gripe is that they are too snug and cause a good bit of discomfort. No matter what I've tried, I can't relieve the pressure I feel in my ears and on the side of my head. These headphones are a one size fits all form factor, so I could attribute the problems with the fit to an overly large head. I would suggest that anyone who dislikes the feel of the pressure from in-ear headphones, which I have never enjoyed wearing, stays away from these. If you don't mind a little pressure in your ears, these are very good sports headphones, so just ignore my complaints."
4,Sennheiser PMX70 headphones,"I have used these headphones for about a month now when I run and they are the best sport headphones I have tried. The sound is very good (I'm not an audiophile by any means but they sound good to me). They fit securely and comfortably in my ears and I can hear all the highs and lows in the music. They aren't nearly as fragile as some others I have tried either. Some of the other headphones I tried broke just taking them off my head. The only downside i have found is that, because of the way the headband curls over the ears, they interfere with the way sunglasses fit on your ears. I don't consider that a major problem, though."
3,"Perfect stuff for outdoor running, or indoor if you are not so sweaty","Excellent sound quality, easy to use, flexible, comfortable.If run outdoors, perfect.If exercise in a Gym, two problems,1. When lie down, the neckband is not so comfortable. It is too large for me (because either it is not design well or I am asian);2. If run a tempo on a treadmill, as blankpage said, it will be poured by sweat and not functional. I am a sweaty guy who normally loose more than 1.5 pound for a 6 mile temp run.But if you run outdoors, no problem, just a little bit better ventilation should be OK."
2,Quality--Not Good,"I had always heard that Sennheiser had a great reputation for quality in their audio accessories, but I was really disapointed about the sound quality of these headphones, the bass is really bad and the overall sound is not rich enough. I love the sporty design of these headphones but it's all looks and doesn't back it up with a great sound. Especially not worth the price."
4,it aint easy bein' green!!!!!,wonderfull headphones!! the company that i purchased the headphones from (onecall) was prompt and the delivery was on the first day of the estimated delivery time!!! these phones are great! the fit is superb! this is my first pair of sennheisers and i am very pleased with the sound!! best sounding headphones i have ever had!!
1,Received a package that was already opened,"I was very excited to order these headphones. They came just exactly on the day they stated that they would be delivered BUT the package was not new and oviously opened previously. You guessed it...they did not work. Now, I will have to attempted to return this item taking another week to return. I felt that this company just had no quality control and sent out items that were sent back to them never questioning why the product was returned to them in the first place. At this point, I will request a full refund. This has been a disappointing experience for me."
1,Good sound but the wire is so soft and breakable,I loved the sound and feel of the headphones. however after 1 day of use and possibly friction with some items the green wire covering started to fall off and the wires became exposed and stopped working almost instantaneously.
3,Great for running but not great on sound,"Like others have said there nice for exercising, they stay put. But if you like to hear the musics highs and lows these really are bad, just check out the freq. response, i should of."
1,Do Not Purchase,"I purchased these headphones and despite the reviews it has recieved I am completely unhappy. Not only are the earbuds too large; the headphones aren't adjustable, allowing the headphones to slide all over the place during the simplest of exercises."
1,disappointment!,after about 5 trips to the gym one side is no longer working. did not get what I paid for! do yourself a favor and buy something else.
3,Shoddy Construction,"I run with these headphones and they are very stable and comfortable. However, the first pair I received had a loose connection where the wire joins the audio plug. This caused one channel to cut in and out. I returned them, received a second pair, and these also had a loose connection: this time where the wire meets the headset. I wrote to the manufacturer (Sennheiser) to tell them about this problem, and they wrote back and said it was a known issue that had been fixed in the most recent model of the headphones (PMX 80). I'm getting ready to return my second pair of the PMX 70s now, but I am shocked that this company knows about this problem and is still selling these headphones. Anyway, I would not buy these headphones unless you are willing to return them multiple times in hopes of getting a pair that works properly. I like the fit and stability enough that I'm going to order the PMX 80 and hopefully they will be better."
3,"Great for 2 Years, then Broke","Purchased these headphones for recreational running, bike riding, weight lifting, etc. Great sound quality and fairly comfortable to wear for up to an hour. After an hour, they would start to bother me. Rubber design is malleable and bends, but will not 'snap'. Will bend back into shape if you put them in a gym bag and they get crushed.After two years using 2 - 3 times per week, sound would no longer come into left ear bud, dead silence. Also noticed some rusting around ear buds.Good headphones for two years but broke after two years. For the $, hoped they would last longer. Not sure I would buy again."
5,the perfect athletic headphones,"there once was a time when i walked and my ipod headphones fell right out of my ear, now i can race across my hometown and into highschool on my rollerblades, go running, or anything i want and these headphoes will not budge! great quality of sound, not an audiophile but they r the best i've heard. a little pricey but gren kinda my color anyways and these r pretty dang stylish if u ask me"
4,Great headphones for sports,"If you are looking for a good value for headphones to wear while exercising (gym, bicycling, running, etc.), I recommend these.The sound is not as good as on most around ear headphones, but the style is more convenient for sporting. Similarly with in ear headphones, the sound is better, but they fall out easily and there is much body noise when you are moving.These are snug but fit nicely on the ears and around the head. They do not slip or move at all. The small clip on the cord makes for less movement and distortion while running.Sennheiser is rated very highly for quality for value among low to mid priced headphones. I recommend these if you are active."
4,Great headphones,"These head phones are the best for sound and sweat resistance. This is my second pair, ISennheiser PMX 70 Sport Earbud Line Stereo Neckband Headphonehighly recommend them."
4,"Great, for awhile","When I first purchased these headphones about 6 months ago, they were exactly what I wanted: a pair of headphones that would stay on my head while I ran while also still being ""sweat resistant"" (aka they are sport headphones). They also provided far superior sound quality to the standard iPhone/iPod headphones, although that applies to most any headphones.However, I an now disappointed with this product. Some wiring has come loose and so the sound cuts in out depending on the angle of the attachment. While at first this was a rarity, it has steadily become more permanent, to the point that I can no longer use them, even while on my computer or doing something else with very little motion. While I understand that running with headphones will eventually wear them out, I was disappointed at the short life of this particular pair, especially since they are branded as ""sport"""
3,A year's worth,"Decent sound, good fitting and stay on. This is my 2nd pair, these help up for about 350 miles on the road - so all in all a decent value"
2,Poor construction,"It's the green silicone earbud covers that make these headphones sweat-resistant. Unfortunately, the same green covers also slip off quite easily when rubbed against something--while being carried, for example, or when shoved into a gym bag. Furthermore, the covers are actually two seperate pieces of silicone, making them a challenge to put on again, and useless without both pieces. Without these easy-to-lose earbud covers, the headphones are uncomfortable and probably no longer suitable for sport use. Seems like a bad design to me, YMMV."
1,Stay away from this product,"This is the first time I have written a review to warn people to avoid a product. This product is simply dangerous, it fits poorly and damaged my ear to a point where I had 2 days of total pain. The product should be withdrawn from the market. On top of fitting so poorly (my head and ears or of normal size btw), the sound quality was piss-poor. Run away."
1,Sad...Very sad,"After reading reviews for these headphones, I was highly anticipating receiving mine. I am a very active person, and use headphones daily when going on runs, lifting in the weight room etc. Sadly, these headphones are only good for running, nothing else. They are incredibly uncomfortable after about 20 minutes of use, and can not be worn when laying back on machines for workouts like bench press, incline, decline, etc. The one redeeming factor that I will say about these headphones is the sound quality; which I believe is majorly attributed to the fact that the construction of the headphones forces the earpieces so far into your ear. Had to return these the next day.."
2,Low comfort,"It pushes my head so hard, that I can not use it. I have a physical pain on my ears after wearing it for about an hour. Too much of pressure per area.I know that it is designed on purpose for sports, not to fall from a head while running. But this is not acceptable, it causes lots of pain!"
1,Brittle wire covering and awkward fit,I have had these for one year and the rubber wire covering is cracking in 6 places exposing the copper wire. They are still working but probably not much longer. This casing should not deteriorate this quickly. These also fit awkwardly and constantly rotate out from the ear causing the sound to suck.(the in the ear portion is on a swivel from the ear hook) really annoying.
1,"Sounds Fine, Poor Workmanship","These are a standard headphone in terms of sound quality, about as good as a Sony. After a month or so, the plastics began to disbond and the wires began to break through the plastics around the earpieces. I expected at least average workmanship for the price, but this was poor quality. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,very dissatisfied,"i purchased these headphones after doing much research on amazon and thought they were the best ones i could get for working out at the gym. however i find myself HATING them because they hurt my ears. they are so uncomfortable! i thought that if i gave it a couple of days perhaps my ears would get used to them but this was not the case. so, i decided to return them. however, this is not possible since the distributor will not let you return something that has been taken out of the packaging! this is ridiculous. how do you know if you will like a product or not without trying it out?now i know for next time, i should just go to the store to buy my products rather online from distributors that have ridiculous policies.besides the discomfort, the sound quality is ok...although alot of ambient noise does get in.maybe this is a good product for men or girls with big ear holes...all i know is that these ear phones hurt a lot."
4,Perfect for running,"Awesome for running. They stay in, have great sound quality, no foam padding to soak up sweat, and the cord isn't a hassle to deal with. Weird thing is, I wore them for 30 minutes around the house yesterday and they kind of hurt b/c of how snug they were in the ears...Then I did an 8-mile run with them today and they didn't bug me at all. So I'd say that these are the perfect headphones for running, but you might want a more comfortable pair for just lounging around listening to tunes.Also, lots of people complain about the color...doesn't bother me one bit. They'd go better with the lime green ipod but I care more about the functionality."
1,Returned them immediately,"I'll keep it short: these headphones are stiff, unadjustable, and totally uncomfortable. I wore them for less than 5 minutes and had to take them off. I am petite, so maybe that's the problem: my ears are too small. But I was just glad I could return them the next day. My advice: keep your receipt!"
5,excellent runners headphones,"I have a hard time with ear buds and with headbands that keep going out. This set has been the best so far and will continue to purchase this product-holds up to sweat, sound quality good, like the single cable."
4,Sport headphone,Good sport headphones that stay in place and sound pretty good.I could never get the earbuds to stay in my ears. These ear and neck wraparounds stay in place. Sound. Pretty darn good for the price.You can get better sound quality - but one has to pay more for that.
5,Best earphones I have owned,"A great improvement over ear buds, these are fantastic headphones. They grab attention from even people who don't care for neck band phones. They are very comfortable and resilient."
5,Great headphones for running,"I have tried several different brands and types of headphones for running and these are by far the best. Great, clear, full sound. Comfortable and large earbuds. Strong headband that keeps the drivers in your ear and keeps sweat away. Nicely designed. A great iPod companion."
5,"Finally, headphones that fit!",I love these headphones because they are discreet but stay on. The sound quality is good for what I listen to... Howard Stern.
3,"Fairly good sound, but...","I have been wearing these for about 5 minutes now and they are already hurting my ears! They are too tight for me. I'm bummed, but I'm sure there is a good side? Looking at some of the other reviews makes me think maybe I have small ears...who knows?The good side! The sound is good, though. If not for the descent sound, I would have rated them only two stars. I tried a few quick clips of various music. For the classical my choices were, Ride of the Valkyries and Hungarian Rhapsody No.2. For rock I tried a live version of Sweet Child O' Mine and Rocky Mountain Way. The highs were good and the base came through fairly well too.If the design of the ear buds were to change and turn more towards the inside instead of pointing forward, and shrink the circumference down about 20%. They could possibly be a winner for me."
3,Left side stopped working after 5 months,"I was really excited about these earphones and they worked great for a few months. They stayed in my ears while running and the sound quality was excellent. However, after 3 months the sound on the left side starting cutting in and out until finally the sound died completely 2 months later. This sounds like what happened to someone else in a review from March 2007. So while these were awesome out of the box, I question the long term quality and durability.On the plus side, the headphones have a 2 year warranty and Sennheiser's service dept is replacing them with a new set. But, that means I'm without the headphones for a couple of weeks, and I'm out the shipping charge to send them back to Sennheiser."
4,"great for running, not for weights or casual use","Great price for a dedicated pair of running headphones. Well worth it..Hurts my ears after 45 minutes but they are perfect for running because:1) single cord never gets tangled so when you're ready to run, you're ready to go2) stays on and stays put without any slipping3) easy to take off and put back on when you need to hear better or say hi to someone4) speakers don't go inside your ear canal so they don't completely block noises around you (can hear a car coming)So far these have held up to my sweat, we'll see how long they last.Poor for the gym if you're doing any bench or seated work as it pushes them out of ears from behind."
3,Just OK,"Cons: Uncomfortable in my ears, the back band is to low on my head (if you have a longer neck it would work better)Pros: Good soundOverall I can't recommend these."
2,Painful to wear,"I ordered this item because of the way it is designed. The speakers are angled to aim forward in the ear to give better sound. I had headphones made by Aiwa a few years ago designed like this and they sounded great and were comfortable. I couldn't find any other maker of this type of design anymore. That's too bad because these headphones by Sennheiser sound pretty good, but the ear pieces are a little too big to fit comfortably and the strong springiness of the neck band causes them to press in too much, further adding to the discomfort. In addition, the wire is coiled so tightly in the package that is stays permanently coiled and tends to kink and catch on things all the time. I ended up returning them for a refund."
1,look cool but that's it,"I purchased these partly because of the reviews and partly because I thought the colors looked really cool. I could never get them to fit me right-no matter how I tried to adjust them, one side of the earpiece kept falling out. I have problems when taking a walk or vaccuuming. I gave them to my brother to try, he had the same problem. These are useless and frustrating and will be going back."
2,Trouble with sweat,"These headphones were great. They fit me well, had solid sound quality and stayed put while treadmilling or weight lifting. When I began working out on the elliptical trainer though, I immediately had trouble with perspiration getting into the phones and killing the sound in one ear or creating a nasty reduction in sound quality overall. When they dry out they are fine again, but I can't get a 60 minute workout in without the sound cutting out. These are really great phones, especially for the price if you are not doing a dripping workout but I am switching to something else."
4,"Excellent sport phones, especially if you don't like earbud types.","I bought these phones because I don't like the typical ""bud"" types which always slip out when exercising and sweating. These are comfortable and stay in place no-matter what I'm doing. They maintain decent, though not outstanding bass without having to maintain a perfect ear canal seal like the bud types. The neckband maintains adequate pressure to keep them in place while running or doing calisthenics without being uncomfortable. The single wire cable is easier to keep out of the way than the split type. They seem to be sweat resistant and easy to maintain."
2,"Uncomfortable, water resistance at the sacrifice of sound quality.","As a competitive runner, I sometimes require tunes for motivation on long training runs. I purchased the PMX 70 to replace a years-old pair of SkullCandy earbuds I had been using for training which ultimately succumbed to sweat and abuse. I pulled the the PMX 70 out of the box, put them right on my head, and removed them 6 seconds later to stop the sharp squeezing pain they created in my ears. These things do not fit. I have an average sized head and I could not see myself using these casually for 10 minutes, let alone on a training run for an hour. I am sending them right back and switching back to ear buds."
2,Ear bud broke within first week,I immediately liked the looks but putting the earbuds in my ear hurt for the first couple of times. I think they were too big. Then after only a week of use one of the earbuds broke. :( I bought these because of all of the positive reviews. I am not having much luck with headphones while running.
2,Fautly earphones,"I read very positive reviews of these earphones but now after buying a second pair I have the same problem - after a few months of use, one of the earpieces cuts in and out constantly to the point where no sound comes out at all. This is very frustrating on an 8 mile run! Does anyone else have a similar problem?"
1,Don't buy them if you have a large head.,"They sounded great, but my head is large (I think my hat size is 7 5/8) and they were absolutely crushing. I tried flexing the neckband so much to widen them, they snapped. I lost a lot on these."
2,Not for working out.,"These headphones are great if your not going to work out with them. Within 10 minutes my ears hurt. I had read a review that said this but thought it would be different for me, not so. Working out makes them to rub in your ears. They become uncomfortable within minutes. Please don't get them if you plan on working out. Otherwise they are nice."
5,As advertised...,...works well. Stays on no matter how hard running; fits my head fine. Great running headphones. Sound quality fine for price.
4,"Great sound, a little uncomfortable",Pretty nice headphones for running and lifting weights. No slippage and the sound is good but they're a little uncomfortable in the ears. I might say a bit too tight.
1,"Cool, but NOT durable","Loved the design elements, and the wrap-around aspect works well, fits ergonomically. Great earphones for about three-six months. But I ultimately can't recommend these earphones, or Sennheiser in general, because of an utter LACK or durability.Owned two pairs, bought one for myself (this model) and my wife (the twist to fit ear buds) at roughly the same time, and both basically came apart in our hands. The cord on the PMX70 headphone just disintegrated, first with the plastic casing pulled off and then days later, snapped clean from the headphones. The MX75 ear buds just came apart in my hands.I've owned multiple iPods, have untold number of the prototypical ""white ear buds,"" and wanted something different. Ironically, I've now spent $80+ on items that fell apart, while those white ear buds still work just fine. How hard is it to design good earphones?"
2,They hurt like H-E- double hockey sticks.,"They have a great Sennheiser sound, but I cant wear them for more than 20 minutes before the bud part of the phones hurt my ears something fierce."
4,Sennheiser Headphones,"We bought these headphones for our son. They work really well when walking, but if running or just sitting and listening to your iPod, they are not very feasible. The headphones hit the back of whatever car seat or chair you are sitting in while listening and that pops them out of your ears. They do not stay in place while running, either. We like the sound quality of the headphones but wouldn't recommend them for everyday use."
3,Love it at first....but then.......,"These are the BEST!!!! Now I can work out and not worry about fixing the headphones. I use them everywhere, at the gym, outside to run. They are great! If you are tired of buying those other Sony headphones, get these. It's worth the money! ***Update: after awhile, the headphones became loose which began annoying to run in them. :("
5,Great headphones for active lifestyle.,"These are the first set of headphones that I can wear anytime. I use them with my ipod while running, doing yard work, cleaning, washing my car, and walking my dog. They stay in my ears, and are very comfortable. Apple earbuds fall out of my ears, and eventually are uncomfortable for me. I never thought I would spend this much money on headphones, but it has been worth it. Highly recommended."
3,okay but I'd like them to be better for the price,"I've been using these headphones now for at least six months now and overall they have performed reasonably well. I find them comfortable and reliable but there are a couple of complaints I have with them. A rather superficial complaint is that I'm not crazy about the color but of course I knew that when I bought them. The green rubber ear covering on the left earpiece has always had the tendency to come off and it appears I've finally lost it for good. That in itself is small but irritating. There also seems to be a slight buzz to the earphones that I sometimes notice when listening to music. I listen to audiobooks more than music however while I commute to and from work on the bus. Still, for the money, they don't blow my socks off. I'd be willing to give another Sennhieser product a try but I don't think I'd buy these again."
2,One channel stopped working after 3 months,"I bought these several months ago with the idea of replacing other workout headphones of lesser quality. These Sennheisers were relatively comfortable and seemed pretty sturdy...but now one of the two channels (the left ear) has stopped working. This is quite disappointing given the fairly high price for ""workout"" headphones. I won't buy Sennheiasers again after this experience, and I'm back to my original, much cheaper, but more reliable no-name headphones."
2,Couldn't take the pressure,I shopped quite a bit for sports headphones and thought these would work the best. The sound quality was fine and they were obviously well made. However the neckband style and the shape of the earphones was too much pressure on my ears. I tried to get use to them several times but in the end had to return them.
1,Sennheiser PMX 70 sport earbud neckband,What a waste of money!!! This thing failed within a week of using it at the gym!! Don't waste your money on this!
1,wont buy again,bought this item four times and the same thing kept happening. one earphone goes blank for some reason. They are too expensive to keep replacing so i went to another brand from radio shack
5,Great for folks with small ears,"I love these headphones b/c they are the only ones that stay in my little ears! I use them primarily for exercising & running, and they always stay in place no matter how fast or long I am running."
3,overall happy,"overall I'm happy with the headphones, very light weight and rugged. The sound is really good. I have a big fat head, so it took some getting use to. They hurt my ears a little, but now I tuck them inside the back strap of my bicycle helmet to push them forward a little. This causes me to have some extra wind noise, but they are a lot more comfortable."
3,Not worth the money (bassheads only),"The sound from these is flat and hollow. In certain passages you can get good detailing and you're reminded that they're Sennheisers, but most of the time you're just left confused and annoyed. The earpieces are pretty big and make these rather uncomfortable, though the light weight balances it out. Certainly the look is very striking -- my wife said ""don't take those back, I like the green wire,"" until she found out they were nearly $50. There's plenty of bass, if that's all that matters to you, but for me I'm going back to Grado. The quality control may not be that great, and the earpads get soaked at the gym, but at least I can hear my music."
3,"Sennheiser PMX70 Headphons - Good sound, but uncomfortable",I find the headphones digging into my ears -- not very comfortable. They come out of my ears when looking up and to the right or left.Good sound. Very clear.
1,Sennheiser PMX70,I was gonna give it a 4 star but the right side stop working only about 2 months of use. Sound on this isn't bad. Now I have to look for new head/earphones for the gym.
3,"Stays put, but hurts after a while.","I am a small eared person and have been looking for years for some ear buds that will fit and stay in my ears while jogging, xc skiing and even gardening. These will definitely stay in and the sound seems just fine, but after about an hour, they start to really hurt. I think there is nothing out there for someone like me, unfortunately, because I have really tried everything."
5,Best I've ever used,"I have been running for 30 years and these are far and away the best sports headphones I have ever used. I just finished an hour run and they were completely comfortable the entire time. They never moved or fell out of my ears and they sound GREAT! They don't sound quite as good as my Ultimate Ears in-ear phones, but you shouldn't expect them to since the Sennheisers still allow you to hear sound around you, which is crucial for running. There was a little bit of wind noise if heading directly into a decent wind, but not enough to be a distraction. I can see why one of the reviews said there was a lot of wind noise while biking. These headphones blow away the Sony, Nike, and iPod headphones I have used in the past in sound quality, comfort, and stability. Get some and you won't be sorry."
5,Awesome Sound,"These are the best small headphones that I've ever owned, they sound great and stay put in your ears. You can be busy doing things outside and the headphones can take the punishment. I definately recommend these to anybody, they're great."
1,"Good sound, uncomfortable fit","I found the sound very crisp and clear. The fit however, became quite uncomfortable over time. On a bikeride or skiing with anything over your ears (for warmth) the buds became very uncomfortable. On the rowing machine as your neck and shoulders moved the buds would move in and out as well, so the sound would ebb and flow. There is definitely a sonic sweet spot and if the buds move around you can hear the difference. If your neck is in a fairly static position and you don't have anything over your ears they work okay."
4,Great headphones - they will break-in comfortably...,"I've used these for a month, running. I agree with some of the reviewers. You need to be patient. Somehow, they do break in, so the discomfort you feel at the beginning goes away. I have used these for long runs 2+ hours, but not yet for a marathon. I use these with a 2nd iPod shuffle clipped to the back of my cap. So I wrap the cord neatly around the neck band, and just keep a couple of inches of cord, which is enough to reach the iPod. The sound reproduction is pretty good. Frankly, they rival my Etymotic Research 6i's."
3,Good But Not As Rugged As They Could Be,"Great sounding headphones & they do stay in even during the most strenuous work outs. However, the cable is floppy & tends to get caught on things. A good tug will rip the connector right off the end as it's not really molded to the cable.Update: My 1st set got damaged, in replacing them, Sennheiser's customer service was phenomenal."
2,Cord completely deteriorated,This is a great set of headphones but the cord fell apart. The wires are now exposed and the set is now useless.I have never seen such a thing where the cover literally falls apart.Beware.
1,Fell apart. Clog with sweat when running. DON'T BUY,First Amazon product review. Don't buy these. They have basically fallen apart after only two months. Both little headphone / speakers have fallen out of their places and now only kept on by the small speaker wire (and scotch tape). They also clogged with sweat after a hard running session. And so the quest continues for a pair of headphones that actually work while running (and don't fall apart)!
2,Extremely Uncomfortable,"The headphones are flashy, with above agerage sound, and have absolutely no movement when you run. But there is a drawback, the buds on these things are huge and extremely unpleasant feeling. After running 6 miles it actually hurts to look in either direction or wiggle my ears. I take them out periodically on my run, by mile 8 they're out of my ears completely. I keep hoping my ears will adjust or that the headphones will adjust but it hasn't happened. If you have huge ears, this would be a great product for you. if not, don't bother."
1,"Bad wiring, horrible service",Pros:---> Secure fit won't fall out---> Loud soundCons:---> Fit is too secure that it's uncomfortable and hard to workout if the back of your head is leaning against a floor or bench---> Sound quality feels thin. Not dynamic---> Sweat still drips in and gets annoying---> Biggest frustration is the wiring broke on me in less than 2 months. Now sound is all messed up and goes in and out. Completely useless---> Another big frustration is the return policy. Sennheiser demands a service fee of $35 for repairs....that's basically the cost to replace! What a POS.Bottom line: Do not recommend to friend. Stay away.
4,So far so good.,I have had the device for about 3 weeks and 12-14 runs. I works fine. It doesn't get in the way of my run and the sound quality is good.
1,Not very Water Resistant,"I used the PMX70 for running about 3-4 times a week. After 3 months of active use, the right speaker stopped working. Maybe too much water got in them from sweating but I was under the impression they could handle that. It's too bad because the position/style of the headphones worked well for me."
2,A big disappointment,"I have long been on a search for the optimal headphones ... and these are not they! The sound quality is good but they are so uncomfortable to wear. The 'frame' is very rigid and presses the speakers uncomfortably into the ears if worn for more than a few minutes, and if one's head rests on anything behind - like a cushion or car head rest - they are forced right out of the ears. The search continues ..."
2,Too big and uncomfortable,"Attention others with small(ish) heads and ears: these headphones will be uncomfortable. The back piece kept hitting my back with each stride on the elliptical machine, and like others have mentioned, the ear buds will hurt your ears after a few minutes.I was very disappointed.Bottom line: Not for those with smaller heads and ears."
4,Great sport phones,"I had a pair of the Sennheiser CX300's which were awesome but blew one of my eardrums due to the airtight seal (be careful pulling them out). these headphones replaced them and i have been impressed with the sound and the way they always stay in your ears. i run, row, bike, and indoor climb in these and have not had a problem yet. great headphones, good investment."
3,Headphones,"I had these headphones previously and my old pair lasted about 6 years and worked perfectly. I only bought a new pair beacuse my puppy chewed through the old ones. However, the pair that I was sent doesn't work properly and seems like it doesnt fully fit into the ipod/iphone hole and the music doesn't come through clear. If I hold it down then it works, but who wants to hold down your headphones while you work out? I will be calling to see if I can exchange"
3,Great While They Last,"I've had 4 pairs of these headphones, so I must like them. I use them for running and they fit me well and sound good, though I'm not too demanding when it comes to audio quality. The problem is that they do not last. The first pair I had lasted about a year, which was good. The last two pair I had were broken within a week. It seems to be a problem with the plug because sound only comes from one ear unless you jiggle the plug just the right way. It is very annoying to have sound cutting in and out during a run.Bottom line: while I liked these I'm going to look for something else"
1,Bad to start and broke within two weeks,"I had hopes with this product as many of the reviews were positive. I should have listened to the critiques more. Out of the box on my first run you'll notice that if you so much as brush the wire that connects to the plug you will get static. I will say that the fit and comfort was there and as long as that wire wasn't touched (tough to do while running) the sound was good. After about 6 runs though you realize that the speakers themselves are held in by the fragile pieces of rubber surrounding the speaker. Once the rubber moves, the speakers literally fall out. You are left to attempt to put the speakers back in and snap the rubber around them like a rubber band. Apparently I must have done this incorrectly as my right earpiece no longer works. For a $30 product I'm not going to mess around with returns and warranties, instead I am still now in the market for good headphones to use while running. My clear advice, run away from this product."
3,They didn't fall off.,"I can't say anything bad because the headphones fit well and I've been through hundreds of sets (literally) over the years, I will never buy anything but Sennheiser. They're just not for me. They were lacking in bass which is almost non-existent while trail riding. It doesn't have the tight seal of an in-ear fit so sweat was able to enter my ear but not exit which made the ride unpleasant. My next purchase will be the Sennheiser CX-680."
1,Too much bass,"I've tried these headphones with a number of devices and with each of them, I've had to dramatically re-adjust the equalization because the overall bass was too strong. Annoyingly strong.I check with customer service about this problem and they responded by saying, 'Our headphones have excellent bass response. Hope you enjoy them.""I've tried to use them anyway, but always keep returning to my Sony MDR-A35's.The Sennheiser's will probably go in the trash soon."
5,All what I needed,Every thing I need while running. I would like to add that the curely wires are great as well. I don't know if they last. Love the headphones.
2,"good sound, poor durability","These sound great and fit great. They're very comfortable. However, the green wrap around the cable has dryrotted and split apart exposing the cable inside where the cable goes into the plug to plug into your mp3 player, and it also did the same thing at the other end of the cable where it terminates into the actual neck band. If they put a better wrap around the cable on this thing, this would be a five star review."
2,Find better headphones,These headphones were horrible. The sound quality was crackling and the wires were annoying because they kept tangling. The only thing I liked was the color. I used them specifically for running but would find something else to use.
2,Try on before you buy.,"The sound quality is good, however, the the fit is very awkward and they start to hurt your ears after about 15 minutes. I would not recommend for long runs/workouts. My suggestion is that you try these on to make sure they fit before you buy. Also, I tried to adjust the earbuds to make them fit better, and they cracked very easily.11/25 Update: Sound has started to go out intermittently. Would not recommend."
4,Works grea,Headphones work great. Sound quality is better than the ear buds that came with my ipod and they are very comfortable. Have worn them on 3 hour runs with no problems.
5,Good for runing,"After I got it, I found it has not only the best sound but also very comfortable when I wear it. I recommend this headset for sports purpose."
4,great sports headphones!,"Great quality, great sound but the earbuds are on the large side so they may not fit comfortably on people with small ears."
4,"Very good ""open ear"" workout headphones","I'm an avid outdoor runner that mixes it up between ""closed"" paved park paths and road courses. I use Sony's in-ear canal headphones for runs on the closed paths and these Sennheiser's for road runs and biking (for safety's sake). They both have the behind the neck form, but these allow you to hear other ambient noises i.e. traffic, ""heads-up"" yells, etc.I really like the sound and fit these provide. They stay in place without squeezing your head/ears too much. The behind the head form factor also works really well if you want to wear a hat or bike helmet. My only feature-wish for these would be the short cord option (that Sony has) for use with an arm band. They haven't refreshed this product in a long time, and hopefully Sennheiser's suggestion box is ""open.""These headphones are an excellent choice if you're looking for very good sound, quality build & a sub $50 price tag."
4,Worked well until today,"I bought these headphones for $45 in April 2008. They were the best sport headphones that I ever owned. Trust me, they will stay in your ears when biking, running, etc. They also sounded amazing. My only issues is that like all headphones they are made out of plastic. The headphones were showing some wear and the earpieces would probably break from the headand if you improperly handle these headphones. That is why I will not give them five stars. However I am upset with these headphones because today after 6 months of use at the gym the headphones stopped working (no audio at all). I know they are dead because I plugged in my orignial ear buds and they worked fine. I am going to test the warranty and depending on how that goes I may change my rating. I am hoping that my headphones were a lemon."
4,A good pick for the active,"Excellent pick for those who are looking for something that won't move out of place during intense workouts. In addition, it's very light that you forget it's there."
1,uncomfortable; ill-fitting; non-adjusting; not ergonomic,These headphones are awful! Unless your head size is the exact replica of the one these were contoured on you will not like them at all. Period.1) They are uncomfortable to wear. The plastic edges where they were cut from the moulding are sharp and hard and you will feel them even on the ear buds themselves!2) You can't adjust them in any manner. One size fits none. Would it have been that hard to make them adjust or slightly bendable???3) The behind the head part fits so low on your neck that if you look up just a little it hits your neck and moves the whole headset around. Even something like the rowing machine. Just looking forward while you row causes them to shift around every rep. Crazy annoying.I worked out in these once and am going back to my over the head Sony Sport ones. They might go out every year but at least they do the job.
4,Functional headphone,This product works as described. Sound quality is very good for a $30 set. The cord could be more flexible. To stiff for my liking.
5,Best I've used,"I use the Sennheiser PMX70 headphones along with my Nike+ iPod while I run. The only problem I've had is the cord is too long since I use an arm band for my iPod. I've worn the headphones for over a year with the excess cord bunched up and dangling on my arm as I run. Recently, I decided to cut and splice the cord to make it shorter. Don't try this at home. It doesn't work. I thought it would be a matter of twisting the two ends of the wire together and slapping on a piece of electrical tape. Turns out there are 4 very thin color coded wires wrapped in fabric and reattaching is impossible. However, saying all that, I've been so impressed with the fit and function of the Sennheiser PMX70 headphones that I immediately went online and ordered another set."
3,JEROME,PHONES WORK WELL IF PLUGGED DIRECTLY INTO THE DEVICE. I HAVE A WATER TIGHT CASE DESIGNED FOR MY IPOD NANO THAT HAS A HEADPHONE CONNECTION AT THE BASE. THE SENNHEISER PHONES LOSE THEIR STEREO EFFECT AND PRODUCE ONLY A MONO SOUND. OTHER HEADPHONES PLUGGED INTO THE SAME CONNECTOR DO NOT DEMONSTRATE THIS PROBLEM. EAR BUDS ARE A LITTLE LARGE; AND AT TIMES CAUSE MINOR IRRITATION. THEY DO PRODUCE PRETTY GOOD SOUND OVERALL.
3,Good sound quality - Chord is way too long,"The sound quality is very good for a sport set, but the chord is so long I have to tie about a foot an a half of it in a knot to jog without it tangling around my arm. Haven't tested the water resistance."
3,"Good sound, good for jogging, dont look up !","f you were backback or you look up to the sky a lot, they will hit your back and push forward onto your ears. I thought the neckband would be adjustable?! not so. i returned these."
4,"Ideal for Cardio-heads, short life span","I'm a runner, sprinter, jogger, rollerblader, whatever. Point is, they're great for these types of activities...never fell off or twisted/turned, what have you. Sound is great! Comfortable.Behind the head design, while great for cardio, is Not great for the gym environment, if you plan on doing any ab work on the floor, bench work, or machines that require lying your head against a pad--it becomes a nusance and quite annoying!Beginning to konk out after only a couple months of usage. Sound is leaving my right ear and becoming finicky. :(But great for running and good sound quality, purchase with a protection plan and i'd say it's worth it for these types of activities."
5,These headphones made running fun again,"I have tried at least ten different kinds of earbud and over-the-ear clip headphones to wear running, but never found anything that would stay in my ears for more than a mile. But last week during a 5k, as I struggled for the umpteenth time to force my earbud to stay in, another runner ran by me wearing these Sennheiser PMX70s. I noticed they weren't bouncing at all in her ears so I decided to check them out. They are amazing!!! No bounce, no give, it's like you're not even wearing headphones, except for the awesome Sennheiser sound. They look super-cool, too. These headphones put the fun back into running."
4,Great running headphones,"These are great running headphones, very comfortable. They can be slightly uncomfortable when doing sit-ups or anything laying down."
2,Excellent Design But Very Fragile and Cheaply Made,"I ordered these because I started going to the gym and I needed headphones that were both comfortable and stylish and these seemed to accommodate my needs.The first headphones I received did not work properly as only one earphone worked. No biggie. I went back to the store and got them replaced with working ones. I was told by the owner to be very gentle with them, which left me baffled -- Gentle? With headphones that are meant for sports? Maybe these aren't the right headphones for me after all.Anyway, I went back home with my new headphones and I was happy...for a weekI've noticed several problems shortly after; The wires popped out from the headphones and I was unable to put them back in and whenever the jack slightly moved the sound would get distorted.Do not buy these headphones if you're looking for durability. They are cheaply made.I recommend buying the Philips SHQ4000. They are similar in style and more durable."
1,Defective wiring,"Love the fit and comfort of the neckband, but the wiring on one side (with BOTH bands I bought) begins to short out after a short while and finally ceases functioning. That means you're left with sound in only one ear."
1,POOR QUALITY!!! Broke after two uses!!!,"Bought the headphones as a gift and they broke after two uses! First, one side of the headphones stopped working and then the metal plug completely fell out when being unplugged....after using only two times!! Junk! I expected better quality than this..."
4,Great,Sure they were great I loved running and exercising with them but I noticed after around 2 to 3 hrs workouts they tend to heart the ears. The sound quality is good but hey if your moving your hardly noticing.They sure are water prof and I only had a couple incidents were my ear caught my sweat but I believe that was due to a great heavy workout. I recommend this product but if your planning to have them on for a long time dont bother.
2,Good while they lasted,"Bought in July 2011 broke on January 2012 (6 months). They hug your head fairly tightly, but you get used to it. Mine, like a few others it seems, broke at the audio jack. I would keep it in a nylon waistband which kept pressure on the jack, which is probably what killed the connector."
2,Good at first....,"I have purchased four pairs of these headphones over the last 2.5 years. I wear them for running. There are a few problems with these headphones. The largest problem is that they simply don't work for very long - I'd say an average of 8-9 months. Generally sound in the right ear will start to go after 6-7 months. Further, I think excessive sweat and usage lessens the life considerably. They are not terribly comfortable in the ear, especially on long runs. I like the behind-the-neck style, but I am giving up on this particular type of headphone."
2,boo,I love these headphones... except that my ears are too tiny for them and they have caused sores... the ear part is too large... but trial and error in headphones is needed...I loved the sound quality and the fit otherwise... and the color is good and for once the cord is just the right length...
2,pretty good sound but that's all,"I can't recommend these headphones. They have pretty decent, full sound but the earbud design isn't comfortable for anything except exercising. Forget sitting, leaning your head back, lying down, etc., with these headphones--the band around the back of your head is always in the way. With longer listening, my ears hurt from the awkward placement of the earbuds and neckband. In addition, the cord cover is made of cheap material that frayed and exposed bare wire in several places."
2,No good for heavy sweat,"Terrific sound, great fit -- but I'm going to have to toss mine. I am a profuse sweater and these headphones make a perfect seal with my ears once I get going. In other words, I can't hear a thing except the popping of my own sweat with each step. I end up taking them out to let them dry. This seal is probably why they sound so good, but for people who sweat heavily, find something else. (I'm still looking....)"
4,"Great sound, doesn't fall out of ear, but","only negative i have experienced is while sitting in a chair. the back of the earphone touches the chair and causes the earplugs to be displaced, sometimes hurting."
5,I love these!,"I am an audiophile with non-earbud compatible small ears and have tried a TON of different styles of headphones. These are my FAVORITES. I prefer them by FAR over the Nike version (which breaks more easily and doesn't have as high a sound quality). These are great sounding, comfortable, and durable. I am really hard on headphones--sweat like crazy while I run and am always pulling the cables, cramming them into backs, and generally treating them like durable water bottles. These have survived incredibly well, and I recommend them to everyone. I have bought them twice (eventually I managed to tear apart my first pair after a few hundred miles running and trips around the world when I caught the cable in a metro door)and if I ever need to replace them again I will gladly do so! I've paid twice this price for these when I needed them off the shelf in a hurry so AMazon offers a great deal on these!"
4,Not so bad,"I want to start off by saying that Sennheiser is a great brand! I have their earbuds and they are fantastic. I got these headphones for my fiance to run with. Unfortunately, because her ears are not very big, the headphones were very uncomfortable for her. The sound quality is excellent and the fact that their is only one wire is very cool. I would say that if your ears are medium-large in size and are not sensitive to a little bit of pressure against your head, then these headphones are excellent. If you have small ears, however, and/or want headphones that you don't even know are there, I wouldn't recommend this product. Remember though, Sennheiser's are made very well and the sound quality is always well above average!"
1,Not sweat resistant,This is the second pair of Sennheiser headphones I have owned in the last two months. First it was the orange pair and now the green. Both have the same problem in that they are not sweat resistant. This really defeats the purpose of sport headphones. They are very comfortable and have awesome sound...for the first two weeks. A few workouts later and they will start to skip and the sound becomes completely muffled. I would not recommend these headphones.
3,Sweatproof? Sorta....,"I am on my third pair of these, with the first two failures stemming from my sweating. To try and avoid this with the third pair, they stay in a sealed bag that is full of silica packs, to absorb any moisture. That seems to be working, but it shouldn't be necessary. The good thing is that Sennheiser has replaced them twice now, the bad thing is that they aren't very sweat/water resistant."
4,Very Informative,This book gives a very well researched history of Bobbin lace and its very disparate and interesting twists and turns through the ages. I also gives the beginner and more experienced lacer quite a few patterns and detailed instructions on how to... I specially liked the way it shows how to do external loops. :-) I will most certainly bring this book to my next meeting with my knitting friends and let's see how many I can infest with the Lace Bug. Bwha ha ha!Jean
5,100%,"i bought this DB9 Female / DB9 Female, 8C, Null Modem Cable, 6 ft (UL) for dreambox 500-s to fix the green and it worked great"
5,The perfect reference book for fans of Gary Cooper's films,"I bought this book in the fall of 1975 and after nearly 25 years, still find it hard to put down once I pick it up."
5,gets everyone dancing,"This has many catchy songs that gets everyone dancing. There are some puppet segments my older daughter doesn't care for because ""it doesn't sound like them"" but overall a great addition to our collection!"
5,Wiggles at their best,"This Wiggles DVD is the ""old-school"" type without computer graphics. I really like the simple backgrounds and focus on song/dance. My 2-year-old and 6-year-old both love it since the songs are catchy. We're also not fans of the Wiggles puppets, but the rest of the DVD is great.Songs:Hot PotatoD.O.R.O.T.H.Y. My Favourite DinosaurPufferbilliesHenry's DanceWalkJoannie Works with One HammerMonkey DanceCrunchy Munchy Honey CakesShaky ShakyPoint Your Finger (Puppets)Havenu Shalom AlechemI am a DancerGreg does magic with his box of mystery (not a song, but entertaining for the kids)Go Captain Feathersword, Ahoy (Puppets)Fruit Salad"
5,My Grandson liked it.,"Baby Ray likes this group, and he dances to their music. When he is happy, I am pleased. This is also good exercise."
5,Love the old wiggles videos,Together with Wiggle Time and Toot Toot. Yummy yummy has the same magic the old wiggles had. My boys love to sing and dance with the Wiggles. The simplicity of the lyrics and the absence of all the cartoon and gimmickry of the new videos is what makes it work. Love this!
4,Great wiggles songs,"My 18 month old daughter is beyond obsessed with the wiggles. I had to buy a second DVD for her and picked this one because she loves all the songs. As other reviewers noted, the puppet show thing is the drawback of this with annoying songs and weird looking puppets, but the majority of the DVD is great with all the great Wiggles hits and dancing!"
4,Something for all Metalheads,"I acquired this DVD on something of a whim and must say, I am rather impressed. The diversity of artists is superb - ranging from operatic death metal (Therion) to the rather rockier (Farmer Boys) there's something here for any metal fan. I personally am more a power metal/operatic fan, with a distaste of grindcore/death metal and with classic power metal acts like Helloween, Rage, Savatage, Edguy, Stratovarius etc, I was much pleased. Other bands that stood out to me were Soilwork for their twisted and bizarre video, ""Light the Torch"" and the rather weird In Extremo who combine a semi-industrial rock sound with bagpipes and a harp. There is also a pleasing mixture of well known acts and lesser known bands. All in all, a good collection of music videos I shall never see on tv! Although I will note that I have the European release, which appears to have some tracks not mentioned above."
2,I want to be more pleased with this,"........but I can't. Seriously, putting the same videos on two different collections? The Dimmu Borgir video is a very good video, but to lead off with it in the number one spot twice?..... Nuclear Blast also got the track listing wrong on their own site. I was expecting to see Nightwish, like on the site, but No. (unless there are different ""versions""). Ok, there is good stuff here like Soilwork, In Flames, and Mnemic, not to mention some classics like Hammerfall and Iron Maiden. Honestly though, this was not a good purchase. The first and third are great. Unless you have to have the whole collection, pass on this. You're not missing much."
2,It Leaks,I received this stability ball promptly but didn't actually get around to inflating it for a week or two at least. I followed the instructions and half -inflated it one night and the let it sit. The next night I tried to fully inflate it and felt an air leak. Should I go thru the pain of returning it or just go replace it with another brand?
3,inflated ball is smaller,I have been taking a class at the Y and decided to get my own fitness balls for home use. I read the other reviews before I purchased this ball. It was noted that the inflated ball is smaller than what the product description says. I figured that maybe that reviewer didn't do something right.
1,"Not user friendly, plus it leaks.","I have another, cheaper, GoFit ball which I like, but I wanted one of better quality. This ball is made of much thicker rubber and is way heavier. Putting it too use, however, was miserable. There are no instructions on how to fill it. The hand pump that comes with it is garbage. There is so much resistance to filling that it is exhausting. I tried to use the foot pump that came with (and works great with) my other GoFit ball and just about destroyed it. The ball doesn't hold air.....it leaks through the filler hole. There are no plugs to plug up the hole, as I received with my other GoFit ball. So I am going to exchange it and see if I have better luck. It does look like a much more solid and durable ball....if I can get it filled."
3,its ok,Bought this ball because I was sure it would hold my weight and it does im just afraid if I fill it too much it will pop so i dont belive mine is inflated properly. it does give clear instructions on how to fill. Ball is smaller then I expected. hand pump worked well did not take long at all to fill it. Have not yet watched dvd that it came with.
4,Great ball for weight lifting.,"Ball is thick rubber and firm when fully inflated.It took 5 minutes to inflate. (You must pump fast)It needs air added occasionally if you like it firm.I'm 6 feet 2 inches and for weight lifting, the 55cm size is perfect. My elbows hit the larger size ball when doing presses.The ball is blue as previously reported."
2,Not very happy,"I had to get a heavy duty pump to blow it up to the proper size. Had I known the odor would still be strong (chemical-type odor)after 2 months, I would never have kept it. I wish I had bought a less expensive ball that would have been just as good."
4,"Yes, but ...","Above average police procedure novel. Has its highs and lows. At its best, it is up there with the Martin Beck series. At its worse, it is on the TV movie level. Maybe it's just me, but at the end I had one of those ""wait a minute -- how could ..."" I don't want to give plot away but seems like a major time/logistical problem was never explained."
1,A Waste of money,"Let's just say after purchasing this book, my score went from a 17 Academic and 21 PAT to a 15 and 19 respectively. Don't waste the money of time."
3,DAT: Dental Admissions Test 2007-2008 by Kaplan,"The Kaplan review book is average at best. The DAT requires a greater understanding and detail than is presented in the review sections. For example, the probability section features only one of the three equations that examinees could be asked to utilize. Furthermore, I give the CD-ROM a poor rating because the reading comprhension passages can not be properly navigated. When the scroll tool is used, it jumps past several lines, making it difficult and sometimes impossible to read and/or retrieve the information needed to answer the question(s). This issue resurfaces when scrolling through any explanations with higher word counts."
1,NO CD ROM,THIS BOOK DID NOT COME WITH THE CD ROM THAT IT CLAIMED TO COME WITH THE QUESTIONS ARE MOSTLY ON THE CD ROM ACCORDING TO THE BOOK BUT THIS BOOK DIDNT COME WITH IT LIKE IT SAID ON THE TITLE
2,"Good Material, but re-used",I took the 2006 Kaplan DAT course and the booklet and the test are verbatim the same material. I bought this to have some more test questions and maybe learn something new from the 2008 edition. You might as well find a 2006 edition and save yourself some money.
4,Kaplan DAT 2007-2008,This is an excellent product! It has 2 full length review tests. The book is broken into different sections which all give a decent explanation of the subject.
5,Great,"It has great handling and the buttons are easy to push in. It is the perfect size for an average person's hands. There are no defects. When you push a button it works, you don't have to push it more than once."
1,Garbage Controllers,"These oversized plastic controllers are a waste of money. When I first got my dreamcast, which is less than a month ago, they had no sega dreamcast controllers in stock, so I figured, just buy these, they almost look the same.... WRONG! Out of the 3 extra controllers, only one remains after the others have officially defuncted. Absolute Garbage."
2,"Eh, pretty bad...","Like many others, I bought this because they were out of Sega's official controllers. It is, indeed, a hunk of junk. It's big, so you might like it if you're Rosco, the huge-handed man, and the analog triggers are hard to press, especially in conjucntion with the analog thumb pad. The thumb pad itself is faulty in that it tends to lean to the left like it's calibrated wrong. It's kind of hard to get your VMU in the port, I feel like I am going to break something when I put it in. Also, the thumb pad is becomming loose... I can move it about a half a cm in any direction and get no response. Avoid this controller if at all possible, but it beats having no controller at all. I finally got two new Sega controllers and they are by far the better choice."
1,THIS PAD SUX!,To anyone even considering to get this pad.....DONT! this is the worse pad i have ever picked up in my life. It is also one of the most cheapest pads i have ever seen. Its a durable pad but its the way the pad was put together is really bad. The one i bought(only cuz it was the only one they had left)the anolog stick was shifted towards the left of the pad and on the directionlal pad the down button only worked if u pressed it really hard. THe over all design of the pad is is also really horrible. When you push down the triggers they go down about a centimeter below the actual shell of the pad so your fingers will tend to hit the shell when you press them down. They tried to lure people into buying this pad since it comes in 4 fruity colors. I also thoght it is to expensive for a pad of this terrible quality. just remeber if you ever somewhere and you see this pad DONT GET IT.
2,Not a Good controller,"This is a bad DC controller primarily because the controls are hard to use and it breaks down easily especially when using it for fighting games like SF Alpha 3. The astro pad I now regret buying broke on me in which I cannot use the control stick any longer. I would recommend spending $10 dollars more on an authentic DC controller, it's a lot better to use and it is built to last. I will NEVER get another controller from Interact again, it might be cheaper to get it now, but it will cost you more in the long run."
3,A decent alternative...,"If you absolutely cannot afford the extra few bucks it takes to get a Sega controller, this is a decent alternative. The Sega controller is more comfortable, and has more readily accessible triggers.I picked this one up because I'm a cheap guy, but it left me wishing I had gone with the Sega controller. The thing works, it just feels a lot different (read: akward)."
2,Cheaply Constructed,"The ""Performance"" line of Interact products have always been made to sell for a low price tag, and in this situation it shows. The AstroPad has no special features, and is intended as a cheap replacement for the standard Sega pad. It has a hollowed-out body, which makes is extremely light even when a VMU and a Jump Pack are connected. The analog stick is constructed of even cheaper plastic than the FighterPad, which isn't saying much. And another thing, the start button is so small, trying to press it will strain your thumbs."
1,just because it's old doesn't mean it's good,"I found the interpretations utterly forgettable, and the sound is absolutely awful. Almost any modern recording would be a better alternative, in my opinion."
5,"Much better than standard ""U"" style clamp","This clamp in my mind is essential for any at home exhaust install. If you don't weld, or don't want to bother, then these are your answer. I recently installed a new axle back exhaust system from a very respected manufacturer. Unfortunately the kit came with the cheap ""U"" style clamps that are a pain to get right, impossible to get tight and of course are subject to coming loose. I was surprised that a manufacturer would spend so much on R&D and then just drop the ball choosing hardware for an otherwise great product? Well after noticing all the rattling noises coming from my exhaust, I realized it was the ""U"" style connecter. After some research, I found these on Amazon....whoaa what a difference. These not only went on so easily, they tightened up my exhaust and made it air tight. The exhaust note changed for the better too! No more rattles! These clamps are essential for exhaust systems that did not come with them."
3,Missing some areas,"I bought Learning Perl and this book at the same time. This book is ok for PERL syntax intro but lacks some useful topics found in ""Learning Perl"". It didn't mention about creating child processes (fork). Get the Learning Perl instead. You'll learn more."
4,A great Perl book for begginners !,"This book would get you programming in perl in no-time !It is amazing how easy this book makes even the more advanced features of Perl. WOW !Perl is a wonderful and easy programming language for dealing with files, small and medium communication programs, pathches for other software and so on.This book gives you a great start in that field, and it's fun !"
2,Go with an ora book.,"I bought this book and feel that it is very poor compared to other books like Programming Perl or Learning Perl (both published by ora). The author frequently rambles on in Perl for Dummies and the chapter names, although cute, tell you nothing about what is going to be described in that secton. Go with Learning Perl if you want to learn perl, or mabey Programming Perl if you already know a few other languages."
2,"Let me get my hands dirty, already...","This book provides a decent overview of Perl's capabilities, but has one fatal flaw...it doesn't really get you programming. I read the whole book, and got to the end having some ideas about the kinds of things Perl can do, but not really knowing how to do any of them. Get Perl by Example, instead. It gets you writing code from the get go, and goes farther in giving you an understanding of how Perl works."
3,"OK, but you can do better.","This book was not up to the 'Dummies' standard, in my opinion. Perhaps because PERL users are so diverse that hitting on all the various wants would take too long? I found this book lacking in substance. That is, you could finish this book with no real feeling of competence in basic PERL scripting. I strongly suggest ""Learning PERL"" instead."
3,"good for Perl, bad for CGI","This book is a very good introduction to Perl. If your goal is to program CGI scripts, however, you will need an additional book. The chapter on CGI uses incomplete examples which cannot be run as-is. This is a change from the previous chapters which provided working examples. To parse incoming data, the author says you should use a perl module called CGI_Lite. But he doesn't tell where to get it, how to install it, or how to set it up and use it. That's not too helpful, especially for a beginners book. You'll need to know some Perl before diving into CGI programming, and this book can give you that base knowledge. Just don't expect it to give you everything you'll need to know to get cgi scripts up and running."
4,A Tape Worth Buying,"Wrestlewar 89 ""Music City Showdown"" is a must buy if you are a hardcore wrestling fan that loves the wrestling from that era. Growing up I was always into the NWA/WCW more than the WWF for the simple reason of they had better wrestling. While I agree that this tape is not the very best in terms of wall to wall action, the main reason for getting it has always been the Flair/Steamboat World title match. These two had classic matches during that time, and this is considered the best of them all.And to be fair the undercard was not as bad as some may think. You got to see Sting and Lex Luger who were over huge during this time, as well as the Road Warriors. I never advocate breaking the bank to buy a wrestling tape, but if your into the old NWA, and find a copy like I did that was reasonable this is a no brainer, pick it up."
3,"One of the nice, affordable paperbacks.","I'm not sure the story made sense in LITTLE ENGINES CAN DO BAD THINGS, but the Thomas fans will still like it. Its pictures are in bright primary colors, but it uses simplistic drawings rather than the Thomas photographs of the other Britt Allcroft Thomas books. And there's nothing in the background of the pictures to talk about with the kids. We like to read a book over and over and sometimes stop and discuss every picture, so nothing to talk about is a drawback. This is one of those great Thomas paperbacks that are inexpensive, making it easy to collect lots of them."
4,Upbeat message in book,"The book has a very positive message for children, and my son loves it. The only drawback is that it skirts around the plot of the movie on which it is based. Diesel 10 is not even mentioned, so the central plot of the movie is not conveyed. This is fine, unless your child wants the book because he loved the movie. Lady and Thomas are there, and being really useful makes them heroes."
2,Very disappointing,Definitely pay attention to who the authors are for these books. Other books are much better than this one. The story line is weak at best and neither my son nor I want to read it.
1,Magic isn't needed!,"Stay away from the Thomas stories that involve magic. These stories are poorly written, and introduce an element (magic) that is both not nescessary and, in my opinion, cultish. The original author, Rev. W. Audry, was a Christian father writing to his sick son, and the first stories were filled with Christian morals that, though subtle, are prevalent even today. The tv show is a good example of clean, fun stories that teach kids how to work in harmony with peers of all types (and colors).Stay away from this new disturbing trend that finds Thomas on the ""magic railroad"" or needing ""gold dust"" to fix a problem. These aren't the stories kids and parents fell in love with."
4,Poetry from Sanskrit and related Prakrits,"There has been for several years a readily available book of Tamil erotic poetry The Interior Landscape which made the poetry of Southern India accessible. Now Andrew Schelling has provided a readily available text for Northern India. While the vast majority of these lyric poems are written in strictly metered quartrains, Schelling does a marvelous job of rendering the poems in free form - depending upon the images and sounds rather than the meter to translate the poetry into English (as opposed to the early stiff quatrain translations that encouraged no one to read Sanskrit/Prakrit poetry).The selection of poetry is not ""representative"" of the anthologies but represent the translator's personal choice around the theme of eroticism. The translator's affinity for the selected poems shows in the excellent translations - faithful to the original text [yes I have read them in their original form] yet solid as English poetry."
5,Great adapter,No issues -- it connects to the weird port on the back of my projector and then on the other end connects to a standard VGA port.
5,As advertised,Pretty simple item. Did exactly what it is supposed to do - allowed me to attach a PC output to an existing projector in our conference room.
3,not very helpful,"I approached this book with hope of my own. I've read a number of Groopman's articles in The New Yorker magazine and have been impressed by his thoughtful approach to medicine and his recognition of its limitations.I also read it as a hospice volunteer hoping for a better understanding of how hope can exist for dying patients and perhaps, how to foster that in them. His case studies are interesting and written with sensitivity but not much can be extracted from them. He emphasizes the need for doctors to truly understand their patients, certainly a noble idea, though the financial pressures in modern medicine often make this impossible. He then discusses the literal ""anatomy"" of hope, what's going on in the body and how the mind affects it. Not much help there.His last chapter, ""Lessons Learned"", is just a little more than four pages long, which really does represent about how much he has learned about hope and how it exists. There's nothing here to help the caregiver."
4,lost first copy,Ordered this at physician request. We lost his copy and got an extra for our Cancer Center. Good reference. All this author's books are well written
4,Not an easy read,"This book is just what the title says, a exploration of ""The Anatomoy of Hope"". This exploration is accomplished through dramatic case studies of some of Mr. Groopman's patients (thought to be too depressing by some reviewers, but realistic and inspirational to those of us who have witnessed similar situations) as well as a brief synopsis of research behind the physiology of hope. As the title of my review states, this is not an easy read. There were times I considered setting the book aside, but as I finished each chapter I was glad I stayed with the book. The book is inspirational and thought provoking as one is lead to consider the power of hope in the face of illness. I would recommend this book to health care professionals and others looking to understand ""hope""."
4,"Smile and hope, it helps. Read SB 1 or God as well.","Very refreshing and the facts bring a healing smile to your face. It definitely is a book with positive function, even if you arent sick. There are some areas untouched though, enduring hope for one. I recommend reading SB 1 or God by Maddox for real lasting hope."
5,Dr. Michael L. Johnson,"This is a wonderfully well-written book. AMAZING is the one adjective that I would use to describe it. Dr. Groopman can keenly empathize with his reader because he too has suffered from severe back pain. There aren't many physicians, let alone writers, who can truly express what it is to suffer and through this suffering a speck of light shines called HOPE. God bless Dr. Groopman for his excellent work!Dr. Michael L. Johnson"
3,I'm a HUGE Lynda Barry fan,"but her earlier books were better. a little disappointing, but the copies I got were in perfect shape."
5,another Marlys speaks,"Who but Lynda Barry would choose the name Marlys as a cartoon character? I know a few other people named Marlys but none younger than me (45). I grew up in the era that these comics are living in so can relate to the very funny situations. I laugh out loud when I read these, my kids don't get the jokes. Anyone named Marlys should have this book. It will be an heirloom!"
3,Truncated Tchaikovsky,"The hatchet job to the ""1812 Overture"" alone is worth giving this 2-disc collection two stars. And then leading off disc-1 with an ""excerpt"" of Piano Concerto No. 1 and disc-2 with an ""excerpt"" of the Violin Concerto was very frustrating. Did not realize that ""excerpt"" meant ""truncated."" Otherwise, it is a wonderful collection. Save some money and get a used copy."
3,A moderately legible exploration of legibility,"Dworkin's book gives a good understanding of the variety of ways in which the question of legibility has been dealt with by poets since the beginning of the 20th century. He assumes some prior knowledge of the works and writers he discusses, but also does a good job of including visual evidence of the devices he describes. His writing is dense but so are the ideas he is discussing. Illegibility is considered in all its conceptual manifestations by discussing a huge range of examples from different creative spheres- the work of the Situationists, James Joyce, John Cage, Susan Howe, Rosemarie Waldrop and more."
4,Too Legible,"Craig Dworkin's ""Reading the Illegible"" explores literature that radicalizes form. Dworkin reveals that such literature is actually legible, and that radical form, instead of hindering the text, actually adds another layer of meaning. Dworkin's book is well-written and provides numerous examples that illustrate Dworkin's points. However, in his own writing, Dworkin does not employ any of the forms he writes about. This book about reading the illegible is just a little bit too legible."
2,Scared my Daughter!,"When I purchased this toy for my 2.5 year old, I thought it would be a big hit so that she can baby her doll like I baby her. The reality is that the toy has scared her so much that it is in the guest bedroom. She will not even allow it to be in her room or the living room! The movement of the doll, voice, and look in the eyes is very reminiscent of Chucky for the scary movies! Maybe she will like it when she is older but for now, it is off limits.I thought the doll was sort of cute though.Hope this helps,Mommy of a scared daughter"
4,A sweet little doll,"I bought this doll for my 7 year old who wanted a doll that talked. We all love this doll. She is very sweet. The sound of her voice is soft not annoying & loud like a lot of other dolls. She recongnizes her voice when my daughter says it, she knows when she has her bottle, bear, or blanket in her hands and responds accordingly. She sighs, burps, and murmurs as she's falling asleep. Just a sweet little doll. I highly reccomend it!"
4,She loved it,"Really cute toy... But she's a bit lazy... she knows the phrase ""I'm sleepy"" a little too well..."
2,Mommy Doll,"I first bought this Mommy Doll for myself, after being recommended by my sister.I then purchased one for my girlfriend's birthday and she told me it was the best birthday present she had ever received in her entire life from anyone!I then purchased it for another friend who lives in Atlanta, GA and she has informed me that she is head over heels in love with her Mommy Doll before she even put the batteries in!FINALLY, I bought a spare Mommy Doll just in case anything ever happens to my Mommy Doll which I have had for over 3 years and it is just like my real baby girl and best friend! SHE GIVES ME LOTS OF LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!Amazon.com were the only people who met my urgent demands.Thank you with much love and appreciation,Carol Hamer, East Hartford, CT"
3,This is a FisherPrice doll,"I got this today via UPS, and the manufacter of it is Fisher Price. Why does it say Mattel? No where on the box does it say Mattel except on the bottom of the box (service.mattel.com) Also listed on the box in front it refers you to the fisher-price.com web-site. Yes, it is made in China(conforms to safety requirements of ASTM F963), and this doll was made in 2006.I hope my 3 year old God daughter likes it."
3,False Sense Of Security,"I went through all three levels of Pimsleur and had it all down pat. Man! I was sure I would be able to go out and just jabber away like gangbusters once I was put into a situation where I had to speak. Well, the first time a native speaker started yapping at me I realized that I really had no clue what the hell I was doing and that three levels of Pimsleur were woefully inadequate. You WILL NOT be able to do anything more than communicate at a very basic level and anything approaching a ""real"" conversation will not be possible. For that, you will need much, much more."
5,Pimsleur Spanish 1 review,Pimsleur was recommended by a friend who was teaching English in Costa Rica. He had learned his Spanish using Pimsleur. I do have to admit that the first 6 or 7 lessons were mostly a review of what I learned on the streets in 16 months in Costa Rica. I've tried other Spanish language programs and never stuck with them. This one is a lot more user friendly. I'm looking forward to completing the course and moving on to the next one before returning to Costa Rica. Pura Vida.
4,Spanish,"I am enjoying my spanish lessons although I would have preferred spanish for Mexico Not Spain.It was not noted on the Amazon web site. The lessons are easy to remember because they are repeated so many times andused in real situation.I did receive it in a timely fashion and so far, it appears to be in excellent condition.I will need to complete the course before I can make that assessment.I would recommend this program to anyone wanting to learn spanish. A friend of mine has the French lessons andshe gave a good recommendation for the Pimsleur language program also."
3,Not Castilian - What Happened ?,"My CDs arrived and I was very excited and happy to start out. However, my Spanish wife had a listen and said ""That's South American, not Spanish"" -- eg. Gra-See-Ahs instead of Gra-thi-ahs. Now, I understand that there is a huge market for South American Spanish, but I bought this series based on the fact that they are supposed to be Castillian Spanish (from Spain). I love South America, hell I even like the southern drawl from the US, but I wanted to study the spanish accent from Spain, and I have been highly disappointed with this product's representation. Perhaps Pimsleur should sell more than one Spanish edition, as the language is too rich -- and it is localized whether they want to hear that or not. These are not cheap, and you'd better know what you're getting -- definitely try this before you buy, do not buy sight unseen off this site like I did."
2,Doesn't Beat Learning Spanish Like Crazy!,"These lessons dont have enough vocabulary for $250.For $250 I should be a walking spanish dictionary.I just finished the first month of the learning like crazy spanish course, I feel as if I've learned almost as much withone month of the learning like crazy spanish lessons as I did with the entire Pimpsleur 1 course."
2,"Too Expensive, Too Little Content and No Written Material!","The learning technique is decent but lacks vocabulary for buying food or shopping, as well as numbers so I can pay for my food!No written material is provided for review or visual reinforcement. While it's nice to learn only from the CDs, a back-up written manual would help immensely since once does see written Spanish everywhere, in the US as well as abroad.There is a lack of versatility in the teaching structure which doesn't allow one to form basic Spanish sentences in a rapid and simple way.Last and not least, the price for this course is outrageous!Over two hundred and thirty dollars.My opinion is that there are many good language courses on the market for one third this price that will get you similar if not better results."
3,"OK For Beginners, Too Formal for Southern US","This is a good start for a beginner who knows almost no Spanish at all. I personally found it way too elementary for me and found myself giving the Spanish equivalent for the spoken English words and phrases BEFORE the speaker on the CD could. Also, this is formal Castillian Spanish, not the Spanish spoken by most Spanish speakers in the US. Also, I have not heard the more personal form of ""you"", which is ""tu"" used yet. I find the topic of the conversations somewhat offensive and people are asking each other to give them money and being choosy about it. I wished I had gone with Rosetta Stone."
4,Easy to learn Spanish,"I found this to be just what I needed,after struggling with a few other types.It moves you along,helps you in the pronunciation and makes it easy to learn.I downloaded the mp3 version from audiobooks at half the price seen here and use it on my portable player,thats the way to go."
5,One of the Best Programs Out There,"There are a lot of programs that teach you Spanish, but this is one of the most efficient out there. Learning a language obviously takes time and practice, but Pimsleur's method of almost random repeating makes for a very efficient learning curve. Most programs will have you simply listen and repeat. This program has you listen, repeat, try another phrase to listen and repeat, and then go back to the first phrase to listen and repeat. This causes you to be fully engaged and accessing your memory instead of just mindlessly repeating phrases only to forget them when you need them.Overall, this program can be a little pricier than others, but is well-worth the extra money spent. I have tried many other programs and would have easily saved money just biting the bullet and purchasing this one. I love this program, especially if you are just trying to learn to speak it (instead of reading or study the language)."
3,Miami Spanish,"The accent heard in the lessons is actually what we in Mexico call ""Miami Spanish"", a variety of Spanish that isn't native to any particular country but rather the result of a blend of accents taken to the US by all the Latin American immigrants (with an emphasis on Caribbean and Central American accents). I think it would be useful in Mexico and perhaps in Argentina, but certainly not in Spain, where vocabulary, pronunciation and speed make the language almost a different one."
5,Excellent for the Car - but be careful!,"After a trip to Cuba I thought I would give Spanish a go. I got this set and LOVE it. I really was putting sentences together and speaking with a couple of friends in the office who have varying degrees of Spanish. The course so far is great and for someone like me who thought language learning was for the gifted, I have been surprised. I will go onto Spanish 2 and 3 and see how much I can speak. We have the Spanish embassy 5 minutes form my office, so I will give it a try at their parties. Loving Pimsleur - already thinking, after doing all the Pimsleur course it says you are at High Intermediate level...I wonder how to get to advanced? For anyone who is curious if this system works - it truly does. Just be careful while driving, that's when I do it- it is hard to truly concentrate."
4,Baby sounds so sweet,"The doll's outfit was not as cute as pictured, but the doll itself was fine, and our 2-year-old grand-daughter was pleased with it."
4,A lot of information,"I liked this book. Hence, I'm writing this review! I would say the book is geared towards intermediate and beyond weight trainers. The book contains many many workout routines which could prove to be a bit overwhelming for the novice lifter. Whole chapters are devoted to strength routines, bodybuilding (hypertrophy) routines, etc. As a strength training devotee I enjoyed reading the ""russian squat"" routine among others included in the book. I think most serious weight trainers would enjoy this book... it's definitely not watered down stuff."
1,"May provide motivation, but less than adequate as a ""how-to"".","Sluicebox placement as demonstrated by ""Sluicebox Sean"" appeared to be crossways to the stream flow rather than in-line with it. Much time spent showing how to pick gold out of the pan with finger, whereas typical practice nowadays is with snuffer bottle. Then he clearly recommended to NOT denude streamside rocks of moss, due to environmental and prospector-image concerns, but then went ahead and demonstrated how to do it! Huh? I have learned more by watching the satellite gold ""fever"" shows."
2,Good man but the dvd is a Waste of money,"I have nothing agaisnt Sean, he know what he do, and he is educated. But his video was really made on the corner of the table, every propsector could have done the same video quality. Many minutes in this video are wasted and at more than half a dollar per minute you would'nt expect that. You could learn more by doing an search on google with the words gold panning and find many videos which all accumulated will make the equivalent of 3 times the duration of his dvd.If you are really new to prospecting and have a lot of money to spend maybe this is your dvd otherwise there is plenty of free videos disponible online.Pascal Fortier Quebec, Canada.The part went he take the moss, was only to show what you could get, but as he said the best way is with a vaccum system that save the environement and save your time."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I had purchased this video from Amazon in December of 2006. I have to say that I am surprised it is available as a video on demand. Here is my review from '06 on this video.ought this product. Sluicebox Sean is quite a name. The video quality is poor, jumpy and hard to follow at times. You go with Sean to a single site, where he has a ""Sluicebox"" of his own devising which doesn't work that well.I would give this a rating of 1/2 or no stars if possible. I have returned my product purchase as not meeting my expectations for a video you are paying $25 for.Don't waste your time with this video. Watch Gold Fever or Prospecting America. You'll get more tips and such for free."
3,need help with the bodysuit,"Ok, I bought this to go under a silk little dress. Good looking it's not, but then that's not what we all buy them for now is it? :-) What I don't get, and maybe someone can help me out, you HAVE to attach it to your bra because of rolling...how are you suppose to go to the bathroom without taking 20 min to unlatch and reattach all the bra straps???"
4,Spanx you very much,I appreciate the control and comfort but the straps to hold in place by my bra are useless.
1,Not worth the money,"After so much hype over the product I decided to purchase it to wear under a few of my dresses but it was useless. The straps to hold it in place do not work. It's pointless to even have them on there. It's constantly rolling down, I literally had to use safety pins to keep it up and let me tell you it is not worth the hassle. I wore mine once and tossed it in the back of the closet where it will probably collect dust until I decide to throw it out. I do not recommend this product."
4,good control but the straps are useless,"generally a good bodysuit...but i guess nothing is perfect. it shapes your waist very well and does not show a pantyline...however the little straps they come with don't really hold it up and are really bulky so they show underneath your clothes....to stop the rolling without using the straps they come with, i used regular bra straps...but then i can only wear the spanx with certain outfits...but in the end it enhances your tummy area in a really nice way."
3,Works as much as it should,"Buying this product you have to know there are some things you just can't fix with shape wear. My postpartum tummy is one of these things. Does a good job smoothing everything out but my bulge still protrudes. Also unless you strap to your bra ( which i haven't because it scratches me ) it is going to fall down. Which can also feel scratchy. Altogether if you have the money to spend then by all means do but if you are like me and having to buy diapers, spend your money on something cheaper that will do the same thing."
2,Panty lines,"I tried this on in a store, and fortunately tried my clothes on over it before buying. It left bad panty lines showing through my slacks - very unattractive! I am looking for a shaper for my mid-section that provides some butt shaping, but without the panty lines. Don't really need the thigh shaper so have avoided the thigh-length models."
2,Not for a beginner.,"If you have been asked to be a lay eucharistic minister and don't quite know the procedure, this book is not for you. I had hoped to find a step-by-step ""this is what you do from beginning of service to end"" and I was sorely disappointed."
4,Entertaining Surfing Film,"An entertaining film about 3 fast friends from a tiny town on an island off the coast of Australia who are avid surfers. Having participated in all the local contests available, they decide to venture into the big time and the big waves by spending a season surfing in Hawaii. A great story peopled by this eminently likable trio, plus appearances by many of the world's greatest female surfers. Epic shots of breathtaking surfing."
5,awesome!,Great female surf movie... if you like surfing or the ocean check it out. It follows a group amatures but has a ton of pro footage and interviews
2,I'm frustrated,"I just wanted to have a book of motifs that can be used without coloring. however, all of the motifs are black and white. So if you want ready to use motifs, the book is not suitable for you."
5,Knitted socks Warm gloves,Jack London's Arctic is the only thing that comes close to this man Drurys' chilling descriptions of what these Parajumpers live with day in and day out. The powerful descriptions rival Bradbury and London. Not being an outdoorsman I had my doubts but to be honest it might have opened new vistas for me. I hope Drury has a longer life span than Jack London. J.Dennis Flood
4,As convoluted as a mass of crevasses,"Drury knows his subject well and takes you on an up close and personal journey into Alaska and the lives of PJ's and if you don't get lost in his style of starting on one story and having to tell six or seven other ones before he can finish the first one, you will get to the surprising ending. I found myself reading the book like a engrossing mystery, partly because of wanting to know what happens to key characters, but also because Drury doesn't leave out the details, even the politically incorrect ones."
5,The Rescue Season,"Most readable. Captures the reality and brutality of Denali and the Alaskan mountains from the perspective of both the users (climbers) and the rescuers (PJs). It portrayed the unselfish heroism of the PJs, who risk their lives in a nonjudgemental way as they pluck illprepared climbers from the precipices of Denali. The vivid descriptions of the terrain and the fickle and unforgiving weather place the reader at the scene. It read like an adventure novel due in part to Drury's objective yet suspenseful reporting style. At times the reader is distracted by Drury's habit of using historical and literary references which really require footnoting for full effect. It would make a great weekly TV adventure series!"
1,Worst book ever written,I read a lot of books covering a wide variety of topics. This book is so poorly written that I actually threw it in the trash after completing it so that no one would be tempted to pull it off the shelf and read it. I kept hoping that at some point the story would come together and I would be pleasantly suprised. The suprise was that it never got better from chapter 1 throught until the end.
3,"Great to look at, not so great to write with","This is a beautiful looking pen. The pen looks as great as the picture presents. However, the shaft is much too slippery for much writing and the recommended ink cartridge lacks the smooth ink flow of a two dollar gel tip pen."
5,Best War Game,"Total Annihilation is by far the best war game ever. It is much like a mix between warcraft and starcraft. But best of all, it is anti-violent."
5,WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?,"I'm with ""A Gamer"" on this one.WWWWWWHHHHHYYYYY!!!!THIS IS EVIL!!!!!WE DEMAND TA GOLD FOR PC!or AT LEAST A RE-RELEASE OF TA:CC!!!Whoever released TA GOLD for MAC...You are EVIL!!! Why torment those who use PC!?!?"
1,"Warning, not compatible with OS X!!!","I love this game. It is one of the all-time best in its genre. Unfortunately, if you have a newer Mac like a Powerbook G4, it will not work. The OS 9 Classic software on the OS X system does not help matters either. As soon as you load a cd, the computer reads it as 2 seperate discs. About a third of the time can you actually get through to a mission, but when you do, the mac keyboard is not compatible with the game's command keys. If you have an outdated mac, good great. But if you have a brand new system, well, I wouldn't waste my time on it unless you enjoy reprogramming your entire system for the sake of 1 game."
1,ITEM IS NOT AS DESCRIBED!!!!!,"The picture of this lamp is totally incorrect! There is no ""Bear Head"" logo, and it says ""Chicago Bears"" on both sides with the ""C"" logo on both sides. On the sides that should be blank, there is the ""NFL"" logo. NOT AS DESCRIBED! Thanks a lot Amazon! >:("
2,Atstro is not as good as Sega!,I actually purchased this item a couple month ago but when i can across it i had to write this review. My joystick on my controller broke after about two months of use. It it also too large for a childs hands which makes it difficult to control. Whenever I play any game with one of my friends they declare that the game was unfair because they got the bad controller. I just dont want another kid opening this for christmas!
1,GET ANY OTHER CONTROLLER,"I JUST READ SOMEONE WHO'S JOYSTICK BROKE IN ABOUT 2 MONTHS, WELL I HAD THE EXACT SAME THING. IT DOESN'T SEND THE MESSAGE TO THE DREAMCAST TO GO UP OR DOWN JUST SIDE TO SIDE. IF YOU WANT TO PAY $20 FOR A TWO-MONTH CONTROLLER, GO RIGHT AHEAD. ALSO NOBODY WILL REPLACE IT BECAUSE IT IS OVER A MONTH OLD. IT'S A SCAM. FOR THE TWO MONTHS I HAD IT, I DID LIKE THE AUTO-FIRE"
5,Russo is great,William Russo is one of our great American contemporary composers. His music is lyrical and accessible (not atonal) and is thrilling to hear.
4,Very Timely 2nd Edition!,"I'm glad Yates decided to put out this book during the national debate surrounding the Employee Free Choice Act. If every politician had to read this book, I think we'd be in a much better place. It's so important for students in particular to read this book because labor struggles have been kept out of history classes in school. Perhaps it would even be good guide for teachers at the high school level. People that have read this book and enjoyed it may also want to check out a short video I've discovered on the Indianapolis hotel workers' struggle for the union:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exBtVnZaWUk"
1,Biased Propoganda,"I purchased this book with the intent of getting an unbiased view of unions in the US. I was hoping to learn some history and gain a better understanding of how unions have helped this country and our workers. Within the first 10 pages it was obvious that Yates had no intention of showing both sides. According to Yates, all companies are selfish, scheming, and downright evil. Unions, on the other hand, are all altruistic, caring, and victims of lying employers. I've seen the good and bad of both employers and unions; how is it that Yates, an expert in his field, has not had the same experience? If you love unions, this is the book for you. If you are trying to gather facts to make an informed decision, skip this book and go straight to a union's website."
4,A good read for future educators,"This book gives a very different look at the history of Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanics in the United States than you may have heard before. The content is easy to read, supplemented by statistics to help aid understanding. I would recommend this book to anyone who may be going to work in the education system."
1,Never received the product,I never received the book and still have not received a refund or any info from the seller and I've emailed them twice. I would not recommend this seller.
1,da musicc man,"i was very disappointed with this album. the songs are pretty good but the sound quality of this album is one of the worst i have ever heard. the really bad thing about it is that it was put out on b-boy records. that was the same label that originally released boogie down productions. i have no idea what happened on this one. don't buy this album no matter what. that is unless it cost only a penny, and thats including shipping and handling."
5,Nice cables rugged and well made,Price and quality are difficult to obtain when buying online. These cables are both rugged and priced right. I would buy this product without hesitation should the need arise. I use them on a mid-power PA system in my rock band. They more than meet the need!
3,High failure rate,"As others have stated these cables do not appear to be true 12 gauge. Frankly, comparing them to the cheap cables most PA manufacturers bundle with their systems, the cheap ones actually win out because they do not fail the way these do.I have a large number of these cables (over 10) and at least half have failed. That is unacceptable as far as I am concerned.Despite what I consider to be poor quality, there is one positive feature: the ends unscrew easily, which allows you to test and repair any bad connections quickly.The sad fact in my case is I have no confidence in these and would not use them outside of my home. My advice is to save your money."
5,Just right,Needed a good quality cable for new worship space at church. Finding a 30ft cable of this quality and at this price is awesome. I could afford to pay for expedited delivery and still saved money over local purchase.
1,Broken,We ordered two of these 1/4-inch cables just over a month ago and one already produces a nasty buzz. We use these once a week. they have been used approximately five times. We are sorely disappointed in the quality of the cable.
1,Nasty noise right out of the bag...,"I bought this cable because it had pretty good reviews, but the moment I plugged into my amp, I got some horrible noise (much like ""nathan"") and tried unplugging my pedals, guitars, amp, and nothing. I popped open one of the ends of the cable, and noticed it's poorly built, the copper wire isn't properly soldered... it's just bad. I guess you get what you pay for, next time I'll buy a Monster cable."
4,"Good, it worked for me","I used it once, it worked as expected. I was able to able the connector and see the soldering, it was good. But I if it was molded, it would have been nicer."
2,Noisy as heck,"Cheap, but they pick up an incredible amount of ground noise. Before you say it's due to the length, I finally replaced these with professionally-made cables, and there is absolutely ZERO noise, regardless of whether the source is plugged in or not, turned on or not."
1,After the other good reviews...?,"I'm really not sure what happened after there were 8 good reviews on this, but I ordered this thinking that it would be decent. When I got this, the second I plugged it into my amp, the noise was ungodly. I tried several other cables, and they all worked fine. I even tried to use this cable on other amps, and this thing still gave noise like I've never heard before. Of course, my case may be an exception, but this item is literally unusable for me because of the noise I'm getting out of it... An unfortunate waste of $15. I'm getting Monster next time."
4,Typifies Revels Excellence,"This Project typifies marvellous Revels Winter Celebration/Christmas music...there is simply nothing like it out there. In my opinion this is their 2nd best collection, 'Sing We Now of Christmas' being the best. The brass ensemble and Revels Chorus display wonderful musicianship, and the historical instruments and languages add a great dimension. The songs are a work in history: you can feel it. What a great collection of songs! The only negative point I can come up with (no doubt Revels fanatics will disagree) is that this album is too short on music at 45 minutes, containing quite a few tracks of poetry/playlines that I really can't work up the energy to care about. I would have prefered more songs in their place. I buy CDs for music personally, so -for me at least- those poetry tracks constitute wasted space."
2,the christmas revels is not complete,"I chose this rating because the revels CD did not have everything. Years ago I had borrowed an LP record of the revels from a friend, and that came with a large folder of information (words to some of the songs, explanation & information on the derivation and history, the names of the singers and/or speakers. ) I was very disappointed with this CD. If you can get me a copy of the.notes that should have come with my CD, I would be happy to change my rating to a higher one."
4,Easier is Better,"My son is 7 and he has 2 Ben10 games for playstation 2. This first one, he is happier playing because he can move along through the levels without getting frustrated. The good feeling he gets from being able to play this has help him feel 'proud' of himself because he can win and 'beat' the game! Great for younger Ben10 players! Not TOO easy...just do-able!"
5,Bensational!,"My son loves Ben 10 and video games, so of course he had to have this. I was worried about the crossover, as most movie or tv based games usually suck, but he really, really enjoys this one. He has beaten it quite a few times but he still plays it over and over again. His friends (ages 7-9) all love it and have it, too. I would definitly recommend this to any Ben 10 fan!"
5,Couldn't be better!,"Dayna Kurtz completely transcends genres and description. Why she isn't more well known in the States is a mystery - the fans in Europe just might be a bit more sophisticated and appreciative of a true artist. There's plenty of seriousness and - for those who get it - irony and humor as well.Dayna's voice is rich, her songs full of passion. The more you listen, the more you like her. And if you get a chance to see her live, having her CDs brings back the memory and intensity of that experience, heightening the response evoked by her performance. Don't miss Another Black Feather, you'll be glad you got it."
1,Poor Duane!,The print quality of this poster was very poor and grainy! I was disappointed in the quality. I was hoping for something I could have framed.
5,Der Blixa,"Let me start with the fact that reviewing band like Einsturzende is very complicated. They are complex, bizarre, chaotic and yet structured, (As the Krups itself).This album is definitely unpredictable. (But so are the EN themselves). If I have to use simple words it could be described as a sophisticated blend between the old-style Einsturzende and something else. This ""something else"" is the ""Red right hand"" of our old morbid friend Nick Cave. All this quiets thoughtful distortion in the ""Silence"". Before there was only mad and chaotic distortion mind you! But still what a great album! It fits on its place as a bullet. Bravo Blixa!"
5,I was suprised,"I bought this cd under the recomendation of an internet buddy who knew I loved the moody compositions of Joy Division and Iggy Pop. While this is a much sparser, less pop-ish work, I simply adore it. This is mood music in the purist form. Using clanging, humming, shouting and a variety of noices, we are able to peer, unhindered by words and chords, into the mind of this brilliant band."
4,Silence Is Sexy,Silence Is Sexy being EN's 8th studio album and their 2000 release is a very low key affair sound wise compared their earlier releases. The sound on the first CD veers more towards that of the experimental then towards the industrial which was their hallmark sound on earlier releases. The second CD though is very industrial and does sound more like their earlier work with an 18 minute long track that. The booklet is typical EN with very strange art and lyrics that are hard to understand. 4/5.
2,A Band in Kollaps,"I have been an ardent admirer of Einstuerzende Neubauten for many years, and I'm shocked to hear any comparison between this album and their earlier recordings. It is true that some of the compositions on this album are nice, but compared with the burning brilliance and intense vision of their earlier productions this album is sorely lacking. Listen to the entire first CD of this album, and then listen to the song Halber Mensch, and you will immediately know what I mean. The second CD is solely occupied by a bizarre, lumbering, boring piece reminiscent of Headcleaner on a heavy dose of Thorazine. First comers would do much better to check out Tabula Rasa, the last album to include the goliath intensity of F.M. Einheit, and the last to feature Blixa Bargeld at his sharpest."
2,Not the universal docking station it claims to be,"I was looking for a docking station for my Sony laptop, and this seemed like a fully featured item at a good price. Both the web description AND THE BOX claimed it worked for my model, but it did not. Once I opened the box, another piece of paper said that it only fits fewer than half of Sony models.I'm still waiting for the refund, but that's a different review."
3,Sequel to Freak the Mighty,"My sixth grade summer school students loved Freak so much that I had to order the sequel. This book was not well bound so it is falling apart after one reading ($0.99 special) and the writing was also not as good as his first book. Still, it answered our questions about what happened to Max after he lost his best friend."
5,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is amazing! I read this book in reading group, and now my nickname is worm(my real name is Rachel, I'm 11, and I love reading)! Just as good as Freak the Mighty, if not better! Freak the Mighty and Max the Mighty are must reads if you enjoyed The Mysterious Benedict Society or The Kingdom Keepers!"
4,Max the Mighty,"This is a great story, although not as good as the first book called Freak the Mighty. This story is exciting and fun to read. The end of the story is the best part. This story tends to be on going and it doesn't really give you the idea that it is a second part to Freak the Mighty. This story is very different than the first. It doesn't tell much about Kevin who was Max's best friend in the first story. Over all this story is OK. It' s very funny and it has a good plot."
4,Review of Feak the Mighty,I think Freak the Mighty was a good story. Freak the Mighty was an acion story. In the story Max a really tall kid and he is clumse and stuped. He meets a kid named Kevin he is really short and smart. They go on many aventers together. They get introbal and save people. They save aladyes perse. She terns out to be important.
2,How do you say...totally unrealistic?,"After reading Freak the Mighty, I was totally disapointed. Some parts of the book were extremely confusing. Max the Mighty was the most unrealistic YA novel I have ever read. The end of the story was freaked up. I still don't get it."
3,Lively illustrations with a strangely written story.,"I must say that I didn't really understand this story until I read the description of the Day of the Dead on the last two pages of the book. When I reread the story knowing the background of this Mexican belief, I was able to better enjoy the story for what it was. The author/illustrator throws weird words together such as, ""Buenos noches, story time, shiver-jitter, gee"" and illustrates them with expressive lively skeletons. Young children would probably like the sounds of the silly words on each page, but I didn't. I did appreciate the small amount of education I received about this holiday, again from the last two pages, about the dead loving the lives they had, kids included. If you decide to purchase this book, read and understand the concepts, truths and beliefs on these last two informative pages so that you and the child you read it to/with can understand this tradition."
2,Enjoyed camera - untill 2 yrs later - Repairs would cost $211,"I used this camera a lot. It took great pictures. My wife is visually impaired and took great pictures ( this was the first camera she was able to do that with ). BUT two years later the zoom stuck in one position, sent it to Sony for repairs and was quoted $211 and some change. NO THANK YOU!!"
2,Konica-Minolta DiMage Z3,I'm just a vacation picture taker and only used this camera while on vacation about 2 times a year for 2 years. It suddenly stopped working properly. The lens started shaking when turned on and then it wouldn't take pictures. This camera was not mistreated! I was very pleased with its performance up to this point. Great pix and great features but not worth fixing at $181.00 by Sony.
4,Lasted a long time,"I bought this camera used on Amazon a couple years ago and it worked fine for a long time. It started overheating and not turning on, so I stopped using it and bought a Nikon Coolpix which has better lowlight performance anyway."
5,amazing,i love this product and mine is referb the anti shake is ausome u really need that when you lock your shutter open it is the best this is not a camera that you want if you want to point and shoot so it is not a camera for a starting kid
4,Excellent for the price,"Have this for about a week, quite impressed overall.Positives: lots of features, antishake works well, very quiet zoom. Image quality as expected for 4MP camera, but I have not done extensive testing yet. Movie mode (640x480 30fps max) is excellent, but you'll need a large capacity (1GB or more) SD card for any significant amount of capture at high quality. I like the overall design, easy to hold and shoot.Negatives: autofocus has occasional problems, especially at low light. My unit is Made in China (entire thing, stamped at the bottom of the camera), so hard to predict the long term reliability. Those who prefer the ""metallic feel"" may have issue with the entire plastic casing of this model (I have the black one)."
3,"I didn't find it effective, still searching for the magic bullet...","I listened to it while driving or on travel (i-pod) numerous times, but still couldn't get much going in speaking Chinese. It was OK, I picked up some sentences here and there, but overall 8 CD is not enough. Especially, the last 2 CDs are reviews and not so helpful.The CDs were also bad quality. When copying to my i-pod, I got many errors.I am going to try Pimsleur's Chinese. I really need a step by step, basic conversational CD. I had given this a try because it was much cheaper than Pimsluer, but perhaps you get what you paid for...Update 11/06/2008: I am really surprised with all the rest reviews being so positive, including some from professors/PhDs. Only one other guy gave bad review--one star (I agree with his comments wholeheartedly). After actually going thru Pinsleur series, I conclude that ""Behind the wheel..."" is NOT the best course for beginners."
5,Had Me Speaking Mandarin in 15 Minutes,"I'm going to take a few minutes out of my busy holiday schedule to report the results I am getting from Behind the Wheel Chinese (Mandarin) from Language Dynamics.I am always thrilled when I find something that actually works. And this course actually works better than expected.It had me speaking short sentences in Mandarin (and get this) that I was able to manipulate myself (to a point).In other words, I wasn't just 'parroting' the phrases. I learned in the first half hour how to say 'I want' and 'I like' and several verbs that I can now combine at will.In a half hour and for only a few bucks?Come on. This is the bargain of the century."
1,Total waste of money,I've no idea why all the reviewers gave 5 stars (and all seemed to say the same things).
1,Waste of money,"I never leave reviews but just had to after I received this product. For someone learning Chinese, this is a waste of money. There is no logical order to the phrases. Most Chinese CDs are set up by category - Greetings, Shopping, Food, Etc...This one is all over the place. And the meaning of the various words isn't broken down. So, sure I can hear them say a sentence and repeat it but I don't know which word has which meaning. I have taken several Chinese classes and thought this would be a supplement. Not at all. It is one of those products that I wish I still had my receipt for so I could return it. But I am hoping this review will save others money."
2,"Good soap opera, poor mystery!","If you can swallow the idea of an Elizabethan research team and accept the fact that his book deals much more with marital difficulties than murder, then you might--I repeat, might--enjoy this book, but it is definitely not as good as previous offerings in this series. Either Ms. Emerson is running out of ideas, or she's cranking them out to make money...in either case, the reader ultimately suffers."
1,This guy does not know what he is talking about,"I thought that this would be a great book. I was wrong... i went to see what he said about my favorite groups, Toad the Wet Sprocket and Gin Blossoms. He practically destroyed their images. Only someone who just hears the lyrics of groups he has never heard to would write the things he did...And by the way, why is there no review about IRON MAIDEN??? At least they escaped your words..."
4,Excellent Treatise on Leadership,"Written by somebody who has lived ""in the trenches"" for fellow soldiers and law enforcement officers. The writing style is very direct and unfiltered. Howe explains early in the book that his intent was to get his thoughts down on paper while they were fresh and to avoid watering them down through a formal editing process. The feeling you get is that of a junior leader listening to a seasoned veteran pass on his wisdom.Chapters include:* Accelerating The Loop* Combat Mindset* Individual Leadership* Selection* Team Leadership* Organizational Leadership* Combat Leadership* Training For The Fight* Leadership Planning* Teaching Leadership* Counseling and Mentorship* Realities of Combat and Tactical TipsRecommended reading for leaders at all levels. Although oriented towards leadership skills, there are also lessons for individual citizens. Would be a great companion book to Grossman's ""On Combat"" or Bowden's ""Blackhawk Down."""
5,Highly Recommended!!,"Several high-speed instructors I train with have spoken of Paul Howe as one of the finest tactical trainers in the United States. When I heard he had written a book, I was anxious to read it and I wasn't disappointed. If you are a police officer or in the military, you MUST read this book! Also required reading for anyone interested in self defense or a glimpse into the mindset of the kind of men this country needs to win the war on terrorism.Paul gives examples of real situations he was involved in and then goes into ""lessons learned"" and objectives to strive for. Written in a straightforward style, it conveys its' points better than any other book on this subject that I've read. Highly recommended!!"
5,The Art of Science,"This book is a rare gem! The concepts are described both visually and textually--even an adult could grasp the principles expressed here. It is a book every child in America should read or should read to his/her parents. Armed with this information, I now know how global warming occurs and how matter is recycled. If all of the adults governing our planet would read this easily understood manual, the world would indeed be a better place. Art Sussman, I thank you, my kids thank you and the world thanks you. Dr. Sussman is truly the Art of Science."
1,Size incorrectly listed in product description.,"The element is less than 7"" long not 11"" like the product description says. Amazon claims they sent the wrong item but I think they are just too lazy to check since the packaging says part number Camco-02903 and Camco-02902 on it. I am hesitant to buy a second one."
2,unsure,"I'm not sure that this product is working. However, there have been no bat sightings since I purchased the product. I have nothing more to say about this product. Right now less is more, please do not push IT!"
3,"Works, but not com0pletely","It arrived very quickly. It seems to have gotten rid of about half of the bats, but they are not all gone. I move it around every 5 days or so, hopefully it will chase them all."
1,I hate rodents,Does not work. Too noisy. Do not waste your quality time. Get a local exterminator. I got one and he takes care of the whole house year round. No more scratching noises inside the wall and ceiling.
5,Great bluegrass gospel,"This 4-cd set includes some really wonderful bluegrass gospel - - some of the best that I've ever heard. There are other selections that are very similar in sound to the Stanley Brothers (including Stanley Brothers hits like ""Poison Love""), but the gospel and the instrumentals (which are also great, especially the one that Stanley introduces with the promise that he will try to play it exaxtly as his mother taught it to him) are distinctively *Ralph* Stanley. The only thing I would say in disfavor of this set - - and only something superficial - - concerns the design of the box itself: there are four cds in a big wasteful package the size of an LP box set, with a big awkward booklet, and the photographs of Ralph leave something to be desired. But other than that, it is a real gem."
4,Incomplete,"Well, I might have jumped too soon. The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is that it is missing some songs. 1) Oh, Death 2) Dream of A Miner's Child Outside of that it looks pretty good. Okay, I confess, I just realized it IS 1971-1973."
3,Seems a little hokey to me,"Having done a fair amount of reading in the past year on various ""esoteric"" subjects, I turned to this book, which had been mentioned in some other books that I have read. I found it to be somewhat convoluted and strained. It seemed odd to me that when Enoch went to heaven he was shown the ""365 and a quarter"" gates of the sun. Since it was only in relatively modern times that the year was recognized as being 365 and a quarter days, this seems an obvious modern addition. Especially considering that in Enoch's days, the calendar was the Jewish calendar, based on lunar cycles. On the other hand, it is hard to imagine that the writings are simply the result of a psychotic experience. All in all, I'd say it is a worthwhile read if you are interested in Gnosticism, but don't give it too much credibility."
3,Enoch was a resident in Mesopotemia,"Enoch lived in Mesopotemia, before Abraham and before Moses, so the writer logically should be from Mesopotemia where enoch lived and influnced by Mesopotemian culture.Enoch is summerian, chaldean, and simply to attribute his writings to any body else is simply wrong, same goes for the Kabala book, it reflects the culture and relegious philosphy of Mesopotemia, at Ibraham's time. The Kabala book as well is written by the Chaldeans."
2,More modern translations available,"This book is what is now more commonly known as ""2 Enoch"" (per Charlesworth's OT Pseudepigrapha edition, Doubleday 1983), or ""Slavonic Enoch"".There seems to be some confusion in the editorial comments. There is no evidence that 2 Enoch, or ""Slavonic Enoch"" had any direct influence on Origen, Iranaeus or NT writers (Jude, 2Peter, Luke 20 etc.) that distinction goes to 1 Enoch, or ""Ethiopian Enoch"", most of which is also found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which Slavonic Enoch is not."
5,for the Word lover,"This book provides great revelational knowledge about the Almighty himself, how he created the creations, the ten heavens, and more. Through all these, he tells his love for his children... An amazing book!I'd recommend to read it together with The Book of Enoch (Enoch 1). Also, wish this Book of the Secrets of Enoch (Enoch 2) has an introduction like Enoch 1, translated by R.H. Charles, does."
2,poor quality,This book is not worth $10.00. Inferior construction and minimal words per page. I bought three editions of the book of Enoch and this was the worst. Save your money and purchase a different edition.
2,Not comparable to 1 Enoch,The Book of The Secrets of Enoch I did not find useful as it is likely a very corrupted text with very uncertain origin. However if one just desires a fancyful imaginative read it is all of that. A fun read if you do not take it to serious. I would consider it a falacy composition on an itriguing subject.J
3,I would say no,"this looks really nice online...i know....but the belly ring is HUGE( it was so long it touched my pants when i sat down. and i dont recommend this for someone with a new piercing because it is a little heavy. plus, the hearts break off easily. but it looks cute(just cuter on the net trust me)"
5,Work!!!!,I had a very bad flea problem this summer with both my dogs tried everything and then I remember using the spray that's when stumbled on the shampoo. This stuff works. Leaves my dogs looking like they left the doggie spa and flea free.. I also use the spray for my home. Highly recommend. Great seller and great shIpping time.
2,Alergic reaction :-/,My dog became very agitated and had swelling and redness of face from this shampoo. Had to take him to the vet where I was told this shampoo has a gasoline derivative as one of the active ingredients. This was an expensive and painfull mistake for my dog.
2,I wash my hands of this weirdness.,"I was really disappointed with the game. The ""action"" was repetitive, the graphics quality was low and way under par, especially considering Disney does so well with their video games. It's mind-numbingly dull, and is nothing compared to the movies."
5,PIRATES!!!!!!!!!,"My dad got me this game, and we are able to play it together. We like the movie and that it's not just a game about the third movie, but also the second, and that you can play as other characters.It's a fun game! buy it!"
2,Ow...,"The controls for this game are better than the previous, the story elements are good, the scripts and subquests are good. However, the battling is just too difficult for me. You're often fighting three to four guys at once, as soon as one's beat, another takes it's place. It's all I can do just to stay alive, living from one heal to the next. Either my hp is lousy or my defense is lousy, my thumb will be sore for hours. I got to the third level before I was begging for mercy and quit. I am not up to this level of challenge, if there was an easier mode or ways of boosting your life expectancy.Also, there are bonuses called ""Jack-anisms"" where Jack must complete a series of goofy maneuvers to accomplish a goal. This is achieved by you executing a series of response commands quickly. If you get even one wrong you either fail the event in loss of points and are skipped to the next level, or are forced to do it over again until you get it right. This just isn't fun anymore."
5,Jack Sparrow rocks this game,This is one of the best action games I've played next to 24. It's a lot better than any other Pirates of the Carribean game. Highly recommened for those who enjoi the thrill and action of the game. This game tends to show Jack as he usually is but he's not so ditzy. Awesome game!!!
4,Nice but no game is perfect,"Unlike spiderman 3 for PS2 (Which everyone seems to dislike) this game is more graphical and more detail is in the faces but this makes me wish I got it for XBOX360 but I heard that you can only play as barbossa in the PS2 so I though how bad can it be? well not that bad not that bad at all the faults for this game is that you can,t join in sword clashes (which the XBOX360 versions had)instead you have this 1 block button.the game starts with pirates 2 (my favorite level is the 1 on the boat where you fight davy jones crew mates) and then goes into pirates 3."
1,Not what the pic shows,What is shown is not what you will get. The mentioned size in print is correct but the picture is wrong and misleading (at least now - Dec 2011)
5,This is a beautiful book!,This book is so cool -- the photographs are taken by a missionary (if I remember correctly) and he is of National Geographic calibre. You can tell that he cared for the children whose pictures he took; they are all so vulnerably taken but yet they aren't intrusive. I love the variety of skin tones and cultures represented. This would make a great baby shower present or gift for anyone who loves children of all cultures.
3,Meh.,"My daughter loves this toy but I'm not a fan. The rubber parts of it are fantastic and my daughter really loves to chew on them. It's the hard plastic bits that I am not a fan of. As some others have said, it is possible for the child to harm themselves on these hard protruding bits. I wasn't too concerned by this. She'll learn not to do that, she's getting old enough to learn things now.What did concern me was the paint chipping off of them. I wound up cutting them off but now she just has some rubber bits on a string. I wish they were all rubber bits. I would gladly pay a few dollars more to have a completely rubber one of these."
2,not impressed,"I bought this for my son because it was cute and he needed a teether. He likes the rubber beads but the bugs hurt his gums, luckily he skips over the bugs and finds the beads that help. Not the worst product but the bugs should have been made out of a softer material."
2,Hurts son's mouth,"We tried several times to like this - even my son did, too. The nubby softish sections are well and good. But the plastic bugs with wings more than once hurt the roof of his mouth or his gums when he bit on it . He's now 7 months and wants anything to chew on... BUT this. I can't recommend it."
5,Her favorite,"Our seven month old daughter really loves this, I have no idea why, I just know we offer her a lot of toys and teethers and this is the one she wants all the time."
2,Doesn't help my son during teething,"This teether attracted his attention for the first hour we owned the teether. But that was very short lived. It doesn't seem to help him with his teething at all. We had a Lifefactory teether and it worked really well, as it is all around softer. You can wear it as a bracelet and take it with you. But we lost it and replaced it with this one.The bug-a-loop has some beads that are very rough and pokey. I have put it my own mouth, to see what it would be like, and I don't care for it, either. He will occasionally chew on it for a few seconds but he can not get it to where he needs it to be in his mouth, so he spits it out and throws it down. I am assuming this is because the beads are so large and yet very narrow so there isn't much room for error. You find a texture you like on that one spot of your gums and you move it just a little bit one way or the other and you have lost the feel good groove you had going. Too much trouble for a child to deal with."
2,"fun for a while, then the rubber comes apart","My little guy *loves* this teether, and he used it for a couple of months before he chewed through one of the softer rubber beads on it. So he swallowed a decent amount of plastic. I had assumed until now that teethers would withstand actual teething. Now that I'm looking at the reviews for this product, it seems the hard plastic parts break off and the softer parts get chewed up and come apart."
2,Lightwieght Shorty,Short and lightweight are two things that do not work well for a shovel. You need a little bit more weight and length in the handle to be able to get power into your digging. This has been a mostly useless purchase.
2,"Cover wears out, lock wears out.","I wore out the lock after 3 years of daily use to the point where it would not unlock and had to be cut off with a torch.The cover meant to protect your bike's finish from the chain is very thin and flimsy, it also wore out and as a result my bike is covered in dings.The only thing saving this from one star is that it genuinely did save my bike at one point as you can see where someone tried to take boltcutters to it and was unsuccessful.Even the Masterlock bike chain has a crappy cover, I wound up making one from thick upholstery fabric for this chain and it's working much better. I replaced the lock with a boron carbide Masterlock."
5,What is security without peace of mind?,"Well. You've seen it. Its big its bulky and it often needs its own pannier bag if you would not like to be encumbered.However, no one messes with your bike, ever. It also doubles as a weapon (i.e- late at night in a bad neighborhood) .So, if you would like a lock you only have to buy once, and a bike you'd like to buy once and keep indefinitely... get this lock.If boomboxes come back you can also use the chain as a status symbol. That and a Run DMC bucket cap and the ladies will love ya."
4,"Great Security, Big and Heavy; Know you security needs","I am a commuting college student that just needs day time to early evening protection. I just bought my fiancee and I a set of Trek 7.2 FX bikes and was worried about protecting my investments, so I opted for the most protection available. Once I received the pair of these in the mail I realized I over estimated my needs. These chains are Serious... now if you want maximum deterant, these are for you. But for security in high traffic non-overnight protection, I returned these for lightweight key-lock cables. So, before investing in these, know your needs."
4,Heavy Duty Bike Chain,"This is a serious bike chain. It makes me feel safe when locking up my bike. However, the downside is that the chain is very, very heavy. I've found putting the chain around my waist while biking helps. Overall, this is a good bike chain if you don't mind the extra weight."
4,Heavy Duty!,"The lock is 9 pounds, tough to ride my bike with but worth the added safety. Hopefully the thieves will pick on someone else when they see this lock."
4,Very good except a few things,"The chain is heavy, which is fine by me. That also means that it is strong and will probably deter all but the most determined criminal. The issues with this particular model is that the protective sleve will easily slide off of the chain if you aren't careful. Also, there is not enough room in the links to put the lock through in any but the ones on the end, making it very difficult to wrap tightly around an object.Other than those two issues, the thing is a beast."
4,heavy,The chain is heavy and you really need to be careful where you keep it when you are riding. i have had a bad spill due to the chain.i had it wrapped around the handlebars/forks and it slipped down in to the tire and stopped the bike and i in turn went over the handle bars. i feel very secure leaving my bike out with this lock.
4,Good Deal,This is an excellent product for people who have experienced the heartache of a stolen bike. This lock retails for $150 in NYC so its a huge steal online for half off. Its heavy and awkward but becomes easier to use over time. I sling it across my chest and it distributes the weight pretty easily.
1,Lock picked in 30 seconds!,Most of these style locks can easily be picked in 30 seconds with a ball point pen - by almost anyone. Check YouTube videos before buying this style lock!
2,"hey, make sure you only buy this if you get the reciever!!!!!!!","this antenna ONLY works with the receiver also sold by the company. you cannot see in the photo, but there are FOUR mini jack inputs and NO WAY to connect to a coax for antenna input on a tv etc.again this is probably a fine product, but only if you have the receiver it MUST mate to.wish this had been obvious from the advertisement."
2,not a great resource,"I ordered these because I was having a hard time remembering drug info. I found that these cards did not help because they do not give enough background info regarding what the drug is usually used for - only class, side effects, and nursing considerations. It is hard for me to remember a drug without knowing what conditions it is primarily used to treat. Nursing is about the big picture, not fact memorization. I'm having much better success making my own flash cards based on the info in my NCLEX review book."
2,not what I expected,The ste up of this book threw me off. There was too much back and forth and with another set of meds running in reverse on te bottom I found it distracting.
3,No Dosages,"I saw this book, and at first I was excited to find a flashcard book for meds as this is my primary weakness for NCLEX. However, like other reviewers, I found the format distracting. My primary concern, however, is that a lot of the review questions I've seen for NCLEX contain questions about whether or not a dose is safe, and this book does not contain any dosage information."
3,Basic,A very basic overview of commomly used drugs with minimal information. I would rather use an in depth book with more information eg Davis's drug guide.I purchased this as I have been out of nursing for a while and didnt find it had the information or depth I was seeking.
2,NCLEX-RN Exam Medication Flashcards,"I was not impressed with these. I was expecting a heavier weight paper and they were too much trouble, having to fold each one. Were not helpful to me."
1,Not really flashcards,"Although this has a lot of great material, it is actually a flipbook with extremely flimsy pages, not flashcards. I probably won't even use this not that I have it."
1,no,Sorry but did not find it helpful. Not enough enough information included in it to assist me on the test.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was not at all what I expected. It isn't flashcards, it's made of regular flimsy sheets of paper. I was hoping it would be like index cards. Not user friendly at all, different medication on the back and not of the same group of drugs. It's collecting dust on my book shelf, wish I could return it."
2,Slow Slow Slow,"First book by this author that I have came across, and I am not very impressed. It takes rather a lot of pages before something happens and then it takes quite a lot of pages before something else happens, and you just keep going because you have put enough time into it already, so you might as well find out did it. One of those books where you want to skip most of it, in order to find out who the hell did it, so that you can go onto better things. And even the end is not that satisfying. I will read one more of her books just to see if it is better or not, if not I will stay away from her books."
5,65th birthday gift,I gave this to my Dad on his 65th bithday as he plans on retiring when he's almost 66! So this countdown clock is helping him tick down the year!
3,Just a novelty (and smaller than you think),"The dimensions in the product description aren't accurate - the clock is actually smaller; the overall width is about 3 inches, not 5.Anyway...The first clock we got didn't work at all (the numbers just went crazy whenever I tried to set it), so I returned it for warranty repair/replacement, which the manufacturer took care of quickly.The replacement clock wasn't perfect either, it lost several minutes per day the first few weeks we had it, but now it's keeping time correctly."
1,Novelty item - Not worth the price,"I can't believe I spent $$ for this novelty item. Labor and material probably cost the company only $3 to manufacture. It is a cheap piece of plastic with a liquid display. I could have bought a decent watch for the money I spent on this thing. The company has poor customer service, too. I received one which was defective. The warranty stated that you can return it for repair or replacement. So, I returned it to their repair department (it cost me $5 to mail that thing). Little more than a week later, I received the same defective clock again which still wasn't working right. Stay away from this item and spend your money on something else."
2,Not Flashy,Got this as a gift for a friend who is super excited to retire in 1 year. Was expecting something she could put on her desk that was flashy. It is small. I wish it was much larger and more flashy.
1,False advertising,"The item description said the item was new, but it clearly wasn't. The original packaging had been previously opened and was stapled shut. The bottom of the timer is terribly scratched. I never would have paid over $20 if I knew this was a used (and damaged) item."
3,"Works as advertised, but gains time","This is a nifty little clock with a removable face. It's a bit smaller than the photographs make it seem, so you need to understand that it's meant to be read from just a couple of feet away, not from across a room.My clocks have gained a couple of minutes over the last 40 days, so you'll probably need to adjust the time periodically. Since all three of my clocks have done this, it appears to be a common problem.Other than that, the clock does a nifty countdown and my co-workers always smile or laugh when they see the seconds counting down, down to the tenth of a second.No matter how tired I get at work, seeing this clock is an instant pick-me-up."
2,Clock,"I haven't been able to figure out how to set it. It was at the correct time, and when I tried to put in my retirement date, all it did was to change the present year. No help!"
4,Makes it seem not so far off,"This clock is really great to have. Even though I set it for five years off, the time clicks off in significant chunks and give encouragement that there is something wonderful lurking in the future. It helps me get through the week."
1,Paper Boats that actually sink,"At first i give a starting level to this book of 3 stars, following to the book, i have encountered some several advantages and disadvantages.Advantage : Good Quality diagrams (+1 Star)Disadvantage: Terrible models (basically the boats are a variation of one base that keeps producing a near similar product of the original. (-1 Star)No Pictures for clarity(-1 Star)High Cost (save your money, and buy a better and cheaper book by authors like john montroll and robert lang)(-1 Star)Boats dont actually float in water (-1 Star)So there you have it ) stars, but i wont be mean and give in 1 star for effort made in publishing this book"
1,Don't buy it!,"Actually, I'd like to give this zero stars. I bought the book and returned it immediately. This is essentially ONE rather bland sailboat, with variations. Drawing quality for plans and discussion is poor."
4,Good for the Lay Reader,"The material was simple enough to digest, and certainly believable. It also provided good insights on the real behavior of investors, i.e. most investors are not long-term investors and the perils of retiring during a down period. The book also provides a good benchmark for when to invest, although the fact that I rode the market up on its fallacious valuation has not harmed me, since I transferred my portfolio to bonds before the market started heading down."
2,interesting but incomplete,"I found this book both fascinating and fundamentally flawed.This is a book that argues that Tobin's q ratio can be reliably used to determine whether the U.S. stock market is overvalued or not. One would think, therefore, that the authors would discuss in detail exactly how to compute the q ratio. Incredibly, they don't. What good is the q ratio if you can't calculate it for today's market?"
4,excellent material for those who long for something more,"Eric and Leslie seem to know what it means to have a lived a empty single life. Their message was inspiring to me. After reading their book, I have been encouraged -- there really is something out there that is better than jumping from one empty relationship to the next.This book has forever changed my life!"
5,Change your approach to relationships!,I cannot say enough great things about this book. I picked up this book because I knew that there had to be a better approach towards dating relationships. I found myself in a position where I had tried all of the ways that do not work and needed to find a better way.The Ludys message is needed more than ever in this modern age. Thank you Ludys for writing such a great book!
2,Written for a child,"Although I thought the messege of the book was good, I thought that it was written for someone who couldn't read very well. A good book for kids and people who cannot understand big words or do not read very often. But for advanced readers, I wouldn't reccomend it."
1,Unrealistic and horrible!,"The Ludy's have a nice story, but how realistic is it for the rest of the world? I really can't take preaching on my life, love life, and purity from a girl who was homeschooled and then married right out of highschool! Their experience is too unique and does not apply to anyone I know. I just graduated from college and am not married yet, so obviously, I'm too old for their outrageous, unreal advice to apply to my life. They do not have the life experiences most of their target audience does, so how are they qualified to talk about how to live life? There are better books out there by people who actually are qualified to talk about purity, love, and life."
1,Worst book ever,"WTF? They married at 17 and 20 and courted for like 2 months? Yeah, that's realistic."
2,Radical Approach to Love,"I bought this book thinking that it might help me discover the path that God has mapped out for my life. Instead, I was made to feel judged, dirty, cheap and beyond redemption. I found this book to be way too far right, coalitionist for me and not practical for everyone. Younger singles, under 25, may gain insight from this book but older singles should steer clear of it. I found the other book I ordered at the same time by Michelle McKinney Hammond, ""What To Do Until Love Finds You: Getting Ready For Mr. Right"", much more practical and much less judgemental."
5,God's amazing faithfulness,"This book completely changed my outlook on dating. It gave me hope. I read this book after reading Eric and Leslie's other book When Dreams Come True which is the story of how God brought them together. This book, coupled with that one, tells an amazing story of how much God loves you and also lets you know that God has bigger, better, and more beautiful dreams for your life than you could ever come up with or imagine. If you give your life up to Him, He's not going to make your dreams come true...He's going to make His dreams for you come true, which is better than anything even Hollywood could dream up."
5,A Very Good Book,I teach an Ezra class at my church for teenagers. I ordered this book for them and we are discussing it and reading it and they are really enjoying it. This book is about real people with real experiences like them. They can relate to it. The Lord is teaching them through this book. Thank you for selling it and I thank the authors for writing it.
5,I believe in 'Happily Ever After' now...,"This book absolutely changed the way I looked at romance and love, and it helped me to realize that only by doing God's will can I ever be truly happy and fulfilled in a relationship. It made me take things in perspective, made me see that I wasn't quite where God wanted me to be, that in order to be able to find the one woman for me, that I would first have to trust in Him, to love Him, to learn to love like Him. He already has a Godly woman set aside for me, somewhere... I finished the book Saturday night, and began to cry, not tears of sadness and depression, but of submission, sincerely asking God to take control of all aspects of my life.I really think anyone of ""dating age"" should read this book, as it not only deals with the romantic aspects of Christian life, but really the most important thing in life, total devotion to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."
4,I USED TO THINK THIS BOOK WAS UNREALISTIC . . .,"But thanks to ""A Reader"", from the West Coast I was able to give life a chance . . . I accepted Jesus into my life as Lord, and finally learned to love myself.I feel that my earlier opinion of this book was crowded by bitterness and self-hatred. No one wants to be alone, and after discovering the true un-failing mercy of a loving God. I can honestly say that the healing has begun.Thank you ""A Reader"" from the West Coast for all of the scriptual references . . . It was the very thing that made me turn my life around. I believe that there is love out there for me -- However I feel that the GREATEST relationship and love is my developing relationship with Jesus."
2,Some good stories but mostly fluffy,"The book has some good insights and definitely goood intentions, but I found it to be fluffy and surface-level reading. If I'm reading a book about how to give God control of my life it needs to contain strong arguments based on biblical fact instead of only illustrations. The concept is good, but needs marrow to add strength to the milk."
5,Beautiful Music!,Nothing quite like celtic harp music. This is a very very nice CD and I will be playing it for years to come!
5,Delightful Celtic Christmas Music,"This delightful celtic Christmas collection transported me to Ireland! As a fellow harpist, it's a treat to hear a unique and different style. Sylvia Woods brings out the best tone and music from each style of harp."
1,Pathetic,I usually attempt to be generous even when offering a bad review as I do not believe mean spirited commentary is useful but this movie was the worst.The script/dialogue had to have been written by a pre-teen. The inclusion of several well known actors did nothing to enhance the script as their performances were stereotypical and uninspired. One point of interest...I do believe the banjo player was actually the boy (now grown) who played in the famous dueling banjo scene from Deliverance. His eyes are the same and age seems correct.
1,WTF!!!!!!!,This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!! Don't waste your money on this one...
5,adult stress reliever,Colored pencils and complex pics equal a great stress reduction tool. This a wonderful book for that purpose.
4,Celtic Coloring Book Conducive to Creativity,"I would recommend this coloring to most adults, but probably not for kids. Some of the pages contain some drawings with very tiny lines. There are plenty of pages to keep you going, so you won't be disappointed. I found these images to be wonderfully authentic and fun to color. You'll want to hang your finished masterpiece on the wall or fridge, and you might even ponder framing it! I discovered this to be a theraputic activity after a long day of work. I had a lot of fun coloring and even shared with some friends!"
4,Wonderfully Complex and Beautifully Drawn,"My only complaint is that there is some slight ""bleed thru"" when coloring the pictures with markers. However, coloring with pencils or crayons presents no problem. If you have access to a copier and want to keep your books pristine, copy off the page you wish to color...and no, that's not intended to say, ""Commit copyright infringement""...lol."
5,A good book for infants,"Babies generally like two kinds of books: ones with photos of other babies and animals, and ones with solid black on white illustrations. I experienced my own frustrations in trying to get my infant daughter interested in books with bright colorful illustrations, and she just didn't perceive them as something worth looking at. But then I remembered what I had been told years before in a children's bookstore, and when I switched to the two categories above, she got very excited. This is a sweet little collection of black animal shapes on white backgrounds, with no text at all. It's a good book for a few months, but as soon as your child gets past this stage, it quickly will get put in storage (until the next one comes along, or for the next baby shower gift)."
2,boring,This book is rather boring. My baby was never very interested in it. He loved his B&W baby animal book. The pictures in it are more detailed and interesting.
3,Canadian Thriller,Ice Break is an exciting adventure that takes place in the Canadian Arctic. It has well developed characters and a good pace. As a Canadian I appreciated the setting and the details of Canadian military operations. Over all a fun read.
4,Navy detail and excitement at its best,I found Ice Break to be a good Canadian Navy story. Its details were vivid and exciting.
2,A huge toy with little appeal!,"My son (4) desperately wanted this toy for Christmas, well he got it and it's sat in pieces ever since, not that we haven't put it together because we have, several times, he played with it initially now it's a huge waste of space that everyone falls over, he much prefers the Police Car and Fire truck. It's not worth the price, is bulky and hard to play with and unless you have unlimited space darn near impossible to keep out of way."
2,very disapointed,This was the only toy my son requested from Santa and what a letdown. I think that Fisher Proce rushed it for the holiday season because it does not compare to the quality of the other toys. It falls apart and really does not do much for the size or promise of the ads. I hate this hunk of junk that now takes up a lot of space and I have learned my lesson for next year.
1,Gigantic toy way too big for young children,"My parents bought the hyperjet for my 5 yr. old son for his birthday. I could not believe the size of the box when it arrived - the thing is huge. It is so huge, that he can't pick it up. It separates into different parts, but the entire thing is too large for a child to lift up. He (and he is a big Rescue Heroes fan) has not touched it since he got it. That is a lot of money to spend for a toy that has never seen a moment of play time. I wish I knew someone to give it to just to get it out of the house. It practically needs its own garage. . ."
3,Rescue Hero Hyperjet,"My kids got this for a gift for christmas, unfortunately the console does not work at all so the kids can get any sound from the toy. I have tried emailing amazon about re-odering the gift but no response from Amazon at all, getting rather frustrated by this as my youngest loves it.Hopefully Amazon might come back to us and we can get them a toy that works."
1,boring hyper jet-useless toy,"this is such a boring toy ,its getting returned the parts dont stay on and it is not fun at all my friend has this toy,and i was going to buy t for a gift but im glad i seen hers its terrible and the kids dont even play with it .it just takes up space in ther room because it is huge. a big waste of energy and time lugging it from the store.a very boring toy in my opioion and my childs ."
2,"Too focused on individuals, not enough history","Fine book if you grew up at Whistler and know all the local racers/skiers.Otherwise, very little historical information about the largest ski area in North America. Too bad. Also, the photography is just OK. Mostly photos of people, not Whistler. Again, too bad.The other books in this series are much better: Vail, Mammoth, Stowe."
5,great little timer ...,"...after I changed the batteries. I bought this timer a few months ago and was not happy with it, only because it was not loud enough to hear. After visiting the CDN website and looking at the instructions there, I replaced the batteries that came with the timer. It's plenty loud enough now."
4,"Easy to use, works great!",I bought this little count down timer to help with various activities and find it to be very easy to use. The timer worked great on the first one I received but none of the alarm's functioned. Amazon was quick to ship out a replacement unit which works great.
