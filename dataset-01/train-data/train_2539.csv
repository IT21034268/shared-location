3,Great techniques but needs to improve its explanations,"This book is great because it uses sophisticated techniques to correct photographs. However, the author doesn't explain things well. If you know how to use photoshop and want to become a serious amateur or a professional photographer, this book is for you. Keep in mind that you will have to read and re-read the examples several times because they are not always easy to understand. If you are smart, you can keep up with the author's train of thought. If you are not very familiar with photoshop, not a very avid reader, and not looking to spend some time deciphering some of the author's ideas, look for another book."
4,compelling stuff,"I wanted to recommend this CD to listeners new and old...I have been an avid fan since the beginning, but I am happy to say they have still got the ""Touch"" (see track 1)...the lyrics of that song sums it up for the fortunate listener. I finally got to see the band live last year and got to hear 5 of these tracks live! It was a great show, and though it was tough to wait 1 yr. to FINALLY own the CD, It doesn't disappoint by any stretch. If your new(er) to the band, or are looking for something refreshing and without RAP, you came to the right place. For us folks who's ""still around"" (see CD INK), jump in head first and enjoy what's hopefully to become the first of many more installments of a great band. Enjoy!"
2,Forgetable!,"I have all of the Fixx's albums and this is easily their worst. I played it 4-5 times and just don't like it. Nothing stands out and frankly now I can't remember what some of the tracks soundlike. Bland, bland, bland. Others have bagged Elemental for being slow but it was still great music. This is not."
2,Their BEST album so far!,I never thought The Fixx would ever TOP their 1983 and 1984 albums Reach The Beach and Phantoms. Want That Life does just that and is their best album to date with a very well rounded assortment of musical styles and superb mixing by Martin Rex.Great album!BUY IT NOW!
4,pleasantly surprised!,"I'm a casual Fixx fan who last bought 'Calm Animals' back in '89. Not even knowing the band still existed I caught them on a recent tour and picked up the new disc after the show. First of all, do yourself a favor and see the Fixx live. The band is nothing short of amazing live. If I'm not mistaken, 4 of the 5 original members are still in the band.The new album is obviously more mature than their earlier work while still retaining the signature Fixx sound. There are at least a few top 40 hits here but sadly radio stations today would never take notice of such a quality release.Want that Life easily makes my top five of 2003. If you enjoyed any of the old Fixx songs, pick this album up. It will not dissapoint."
4,A New Fixx,"Still rocking 21 years after their debut disc, 1982's ""Shuttered Room,"" the Fixx are back with a new album, ""Want That Life,"" and it's excellent. The first pair of tracks, ""Touch"" and ""You Don't Have To Prove Yourself,"" are two of the best songs the band have done in years, really catchy stuff with great hooks. But the rest of the album is solid as well, with more fine songs like ""Are You Satisfied,"" the title track, ""No Hollywood Ending,"" ""Roger And Out,"" and ""Brave."" Although their time of hit singles and big record sales may be over, I'm thrilled that Cy Curnin and the rest of the Fixx are still making music. They're a great band, and their diehard fans, myself included, are still here for them. With ""Want That Life,"" the Fixx are still going strong."
5,This is a great book.,"This is a great book. Article format with just about every conceivable topic covered in some detail. Drills, tactics, philosophy, psychology, team management. Everything. Well worth the price and should be on every intermediate to advanced coach's shelf. My copy is dog-earred!"
4,Very informative text.,"The text is very helpful and informative. The illustrations are somewhat confusing. A suggestion would be to include color in the illustrations to differentiate between offense, defense, etc.... In all, possibly the best book I've read on the subject."
2,Opened it maybe twice,"I bought this book when I was learning InDesign a while back. I have honestly opened it maybe at the most two times in my life. Now of course it's useless because Adobe is up to CS4 now. If you see this, run away."
5,Fantastic!,"I am an InDesign instructor, and this book has helped my workshop participants tremendously. Folks who've been using Quark and PageMaker will also find this book a great time-saver. Will it be updated for CS3 soon? Evenso, it is a great reference book -- my copy is dog-eared (a sign of a useful resource). Bravo!"
3,meh - kinda outdated,"this is a book for the middle ages. Nothing abouyt websites, email, etc. Not really worth buying anymore, I'm afraid. There is good info still, but there is a lot of obsolete stuff too"
4,A very nice voice phone,"I just upgraded from a very old Nokia, so having the ""new"" features of the past few years is really rather nice. I used Mac OS X's Address Book's ""Send these contacts..."" feature to instantly load up the address book on the phone, so that's nice. It doesn't sync, of course, so you get some duplicates, but that's easy to handle.It would appear, however, that contact shuffling is the limit of the bluetooth. You can't get photos off the phone except by paying Sprint for their vision plan. Same for ringtones and other data. The BT only does contacts and voice devices, and even then only OBEX Push.For this one reason I'm considering the A900. For every other possible thing I'll say I love this phone and it's very, very easy to use and very powerful. I just wish the BT support was a little more advanced."
3,Nice Phone... but,"Soriunt convinced Sanyo to disable the file transfer capabilities of the Katana so that you can only transfer address book entries (one at a time). I have not found a way other then through the PCS Vision Service to copy ringtones, wallpapers and screen savers to the phone. It would also be nice to be able to synchronize the address book and calendar with Outlook."
2,big disappointment,"I just paid $300 for this because my old phone was stolen and I wasn't eligible for the discount you normally get when you buy a new phone. On the plus side this phone has good audio quality and seems to be better at maintaining a connection than the last two phones I've owned. And it's a good looking phone. The camera isn't very useful, but that's true of most camera phones.The downside is that this phone is crippled in fairly significant ways. Sprint claims you can use it as a modem, but it doesn't work with a Mac - the Mac sees the USB device but doesn't think it's a modem. And you can't do much in the way of transferring pictures, contacts, ringtones, etc. with this phone - either they've deliberately crippled the phone or changed the interface to be incompatible with that used by other phones, which pretty much amounts to crippling the phone. I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers."
4,Wonderful reading - until the end,"I would love to give this book 5 stars. It was very well written and made me think. No doubt, this is her best book so far. However, this book has the same problem her last two - she builds up the plot, and then wraps everything up too neat and pat. There is no real climax; Maddison just waves her arms and the book stops. (The scientist in me also wonders how anyone could prove what they say is in the box is really what is in the box, but that is a side issue.)"
3,Bed Time Reading,"Mystery with religious overtones. Long descriptive passages on the various characters both of their clothing and anatomy which will stimulate those who like to formulate mental pictures of the various players but will slow down the action for those who like things to ""move along."" I read it while reading other ebooks mostly of a technical nature at the same time. It is a book to read the last hour before going to bed."
3,Not much you won't find everywhere else,"This is a not too bad but not too good discussion of all the usual DSP topics. The author chooses to do some very strange things, for example there is no explicit use of normalized frequency, but when discussing filter design it is used without much mention which could be very confusing. Good points for the book are some interesting MATLAB routines, and fairly comprehensive coverage at a junior/senior level. I'd suggest McClellan's DSP First, Steiglitz's Digital Signal Processing Primer, and Intro. to Signal Processing by Orfanidis over this for someone who really wants to understand things. If you already do understand the material and are looking for a supplemental reference, Mitra or O&S seem like better choices to me."
4,Almost Blue me Away!,"Did a very good job. BMW's are known for their blueing pipes and this did the best of any products I've tried. Did NOT completely go away & hey, that's like aging marks, eh? So, would I buy it again? No, because I will learn to live with the blues; actually its quite attractive, polished cosmic blue....BUT I do recommend it to those with different bikes, Be aware, its expensive and comes in a little container, actually looks bigger on screen than it is! So, will it take your blues away? maybe yes, maybe no. But I am more content for having tried."
3,"zipper get caught on material a lot, but ok bag","This bag made my two year old happy and has plenty of room for him to grow. Washes well. The only downside is that the zipper gets caught in the yellow material at the botttom a lot. I guess if the child was old enough not to open the bag all the way (the zipper comes down with just a pull on material, if if you don't want it to) and no matter how careful I am, it still gets caught on material 75% of the time. This is why I only gave it 3 stars. Otherwise it would have been a 5. This is a medium weight bag, so as long as it not winter months or really high altitude, they can use it outdoors. We have only used it in the backyard or livingroom floor so far."
5,Trish get's a harder edge!,"Maybe, as she says, her music has a harder edge because she is now writing about her adult years. However I think it's the addition of Billy Harvey to the band. Saw her last week in Little Rock and even the older stuff has more of a rock sound to it. New CD is fantastic!!!Johnny Too Blue-about her uncle's inability to come all the way back from his Vietnam War experience.Me Behind the Wheel- Three On The Tree What A Scene!Sunday- About a robbery of an IHOP gone bad...based on a poem written by Trish's Swat Team neighbor. AND a great version of an old Nancy Sinatra song it's just called BOOTS on the CD. Nancy SAID she was leaving the guy, but probably would have come back for a diamond bracelet. Trish not only is leaving she WON'T be coming back and will probably kick his A** on her way out!She is writing and singing better than ever!"
5,LOVE IT ANY TIME!!!,I wish I could get more music from Ah-Kin --- Sadly only have this one CD & thankfully it is on my computer so even if I loose the CD or ruin it I can still hear their music!!!
1,Take care with the seller EVERLABS,"I received the product by Everlabs, passed 60 days I realized that I was cheated. Instead of 4gb, the capacity received was 1gb, but somehow it showed 4gb. It was a fake. TAKE CARE WITH EVERLABS"
4,ACP-EP Memory 4 GB USB 2.0 Mini Flash Drive,Product has worked well for me. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that I prefer the LED to be off when the drive isn't being accessed versus the always on as it is.
3,Too slow for dail use,"Had an issue with the first one that I received. I could not format it any way so I could not add data to it. Returned without hassle so I would rate the customer service higher than the product. The drive is VERY slow writing data to it, slower than than my USB 1.1 drive and this goes for deleting. It took me almost an hour to delete my original 2gb of data that I wrote to it. Once data is on the drive reading seems to be acceptable but I would not use it for a any application use; i.e. bootable utilities or OS's like any Linux distro.Overall, if you have a large amount of data and will only be writing small amounts of data, after your original data dump, then having 4gb in a portable format could be worth it. If speed is your need, look elsewhere since as they say ""you get what you pay for"".."
3,The Hi-Speed Flash drive is not so speedy afterall,"The Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Mini Flash Drive is pretty slow. It takes forever to write something to memory. It is also slow when you play things from it. Transfers often time one because it takes so long to write the files into the flash drive's memory. You get what you pay for. It is cheap, not that reliable, not good in a hurry, but ok if you just want to store non-vital things there. I use it to unload myTiVo TCD649080 Series2 80-Hour Dual-Tuner Digital Video Recorderwhenever it gets too full. It holds 2 movies and a couple of shows at the lowest quality setting. It is an ok value, just don't put anythign of vital importance in it."
2,"OK, until it cracked","I thought I'd gotten a great deal on these attractive and versatile bowls, until a month into owning them when the 1 1/2 quart bowl split ride down the side. The crack is about 4 inches long right from the rim. I didn't abuse the bowls, always handwashed (I don't even own a dishwasher), never put in the oven, on the stove, or in the freezer. They should be sturdier than this!"
4,Good Mixing Bowl Set,"The bowls are light weight stainless steel and are higher than the others I have. Their is not much to say about them except I expected to be using the larger one's more, but now find the two smaller sizes very handy for little things. I don't know how they can come apart as one Commenter wrote because they are each made from one piece of metal. They work fine but I still prefer my old rubber bowl set that they replaced."
3,Stainless steel bowls are OK,"GOT WHAT I ORDERED. ONE BOWL WAS DENTED ON ARRIVAL. NO BIG DEAL TO ME, BUT PROVES THAT THE GUAGE IS PRETTY THIN. BUT GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY USE."
1,Terrible business,"I placed the order and received the confirmation letter from Amazom.com a week ago. Now, I got email, which said The Natural Health Shoppe (the seller) can not confirmed the shipment of this order. My order has to be cancelled! NO Credibility at all!"
1,you must be kidding...list price $50??? PLEASE,Purchased these as a gift and I'm embarrassed to give them.Total junk...right off the manufacturing floor in Pou-Pou China!Make another selection!
2,Wind-Up drops all their good bands and keeps this?,"Strange label...if the bad sounds unique, they drop them...if the band will follow a stale formula that sounds like everything else...they keep 'em. I'd pass right by this CD folks, and from the band I saw on tour, their is no way 12 Stones digs the CD either, they are way more capable than this overproduced CD. Check out the new Fozzy all that remains reloaded CD/DVD or if you want to get really agressive, the SkinnedAlive live cd from Skinlab....incredible CD's."
3,ech,with all the rave reviews I really expected more from this. My first twelve stones will probably be my last.
2,DISSAPOINTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love 12 stones... the early years. My favorite band went secular! The lyrics are horrible. Their only saving grace was their instrumental aspect. The whole point of me listening to them was to have CHRISTIAN rock music. If I wanted rock music with cussing and repulsive lyrics, I would go out and buy Nickelback, and Puddle of Mudd. I was so, SO, dissapointed by the betrayal of 12 stones to the music world. What happened to these guys?!?!?!?! I know they went through stuff, but enough to affect their music? Don't buy this if you are looking for Christian Rock, go for Skillet, Red, Demon Hunter, Thousand Foot Krutch, anyone that thanks God for their talent, not just their wives, gf, and kids for support in their lives. Sorry guys to be Johnny Raincloud. -TSCollideEnd of SilenceThe TriptychThe Art of Breaking"
1,12 stones cd's,I wish i could share my reviews but i still have'nt recieved the cd's i ordered about a month ago. Very dissappointed with amazon and will never order again.
4,12 Stones continue to rock,12 stones have put out three cohesivbe rock albums. The usual harder songs and softer songs are present.
2,disappointing,first 2 cds were great....went secular and lost their hard edge in their music and lyrics. very disappointed! hopefully they'll see the light again!
1,"Incredibly sticky -- not a ""nonstick""!","The grooves in this pan make it nearly impossible to clean, and only a year later, my ""nonstick"" pan can't cook anything without sticking, even with a deep layer of oil in the bottom. Horrible diappointment."
1,Poor nonstick quality,Followed the instructions for using this pan. The bottom is ribbed and that makes it hard to clean. Sear mark started appearing on the pan and are very difficult to get off. The more it's used the harder it is to clean and eventually the burnt marks can't be removed.
3,All Scuffed Up! :(,"I own two of these potties. We're practicing elimination communication and these potties are the perfect size for infants! I love that there aren't any extra bells and whistles to get in the way of easy clean up.We have one in blue and one in yellow. My only complaint is that the yellow one came with huge black scuff marks and scratches all over it. Even with extensive scrubbing, I can't get all the black off. Obviously, this doesn't affect useability, but I feel robbed paying full-price for something that looks like it's been thrown under a bus. I'm sure Amazon would have accepted it as a return, but what new parent has the time for that? Big disappointment! Especially since the yellow color was sooooo cute! Way cuter than the blue - which, in comparison, seems a bit dull."
5,a great little potty,"We started using this potty when our baby was about 9 months old. We aren't really pushing potty training, but letting him figure it out on his own. He started peeing in the potty the 2nd day we used it, and now does so regularly, though we have not had success with bowel movements yet. He seems comfortable on it, though he usually sits down and does his business and is done. Alot of times, the pee does hit the splash guard and spray around the potty, but this seems to happen with most potties- he is just not hold enough to aim. Our baby is 30 inches and about 25 pounds, and his legs are getting a bit long for this potty, so it is for the smaller child. Good function, good price."
5,great travel potty,"We used this for when we were out and about. It was much easier to tote around than our other, bigger potty seat, but our daughter liked using it just as well. It is very small and low to the ground, so I wouldn't want to use it as our main potty chair, but for taking to a friend's house or having in the car for an emergency, it was just the thing!"
3,Its a pot to pee in,"Its hard to see when they go, you have to be top down. At least with boys, I don't know how you would know if a girl went. We use ours with my 3 month old for elimination communication. He loves it, its his little throne. The cutout in the back lets you pick it up without spilling pee on yourself ant the splash guard keeps the boy pee at bay.Ikea sells one very similar for under $5."
5,Perfect Potty,"I bought this potty to use with my 6 month old son. He has just learned to sit and can just about sit unsupported on this little potty. He seems to love it. I've lost track of how many times he's ""used"" it. Sometimes I think he'd stay on this potty for hours if I just kept handing him new toys to play with. I've actually purchased 2 more of these potties to have for the car and grandma's house. Love the design and it's super easy to clean."
5,For small babies,This is a perfect potty for a small baby.My son is 6 months and it is great for him.It is easy to clean and wipe.We are very happy with it.
2,"Wow, what a TINY potty!!!","I got this potty for my 22 month old and he is too big for it. It's pretty funny that the website lists ages 24 months to 6 years old. My son is very tall for his age, but by no means the size of a 6 year old! It might make a good potty for a doll oor something."
2,Ridiculously Small,I received this today and even after reading the reviews that said it was small I was really surprised to see how small it actually was. I am still debating on returning it. I like the simple design but it is really small for my 1 1/2 year old.
4,worked for a while,i bought this potty when i was trying to potty train my 6 month old. i worked well because it is very small and she was able to put her feet on the floor which made her more comfortable. by the time she was 1 yr old i had to buy a larger one.
4,"Great little potty, but.....",My 8 month old daughter is obviously very comfortable sitting on this potty and EC is definitely easier when using it. The one negative thing is the color. We have a red one and it is hard to see if she has urinated in it if I don't actually see the stream myself. I would recommend a white one or clear one. Overall a great product!
5,Great for babies,"I had heard about elimination communication and originally thought ""what crazy person would start potty training a baby?"" The more I read about it, though, the more I was interested and amazed and thought I wanted to try it. I got this potty because so many who practiced EC use it. My son is 5 1/2 months old and we've been using the potty for 2 weeks. It is a great size for him and he seems to be comfortable. Since he's so young I really only put him on it when he wakes up in the morning and when he wakes up from a nap so I'm not totally doing the ""EC"" thing. It is amazing because it really works- he does his business almost as soon as he sits on it. As he gets older we'll use it more often but I think for his young age a few times a day is enough just to introduce him to the potty. If you have a baby I would definitely recommend reading up on EC even though you may think it's crazy when you first hear about it, just like I did. If you decide to EC definitely buy this potty!!"
3,ok for the price...good for travel,"This potty seat is a good buy to just throw in the back of your car for travel purposes, which is what we use it for. However, it is VERY small. My son is 2 1/2 and is of average size (height and weight). It's not all that easy for him to get himself on and especially OFF this potty. Again, it's a good price for an on-the-go potty for people who travel in their cars alot & it is very easy to clean. The splash guard also works very well for boys. Be careful with bigger kids when they're getting up though. Make sure you're holding the potty down with one hand. My son has leaped up a few times with the potty still stuck to his bum, which leads to pee all over the floor!"
1,Not a fan of this potty,"We bought this potty to introduce the idea of potty training to our 13 month old son. He is ~26 lb, 32 inches tall and a size 4 diaper and this potty is already too small for him! The opening is not large enough and sometimes he pees over the front and it's been known to stick to his little bottom when he stands up because it's such a tight fit. We've had it about 2 months and are now shopping for a larger potty. Another complaint is that it does not have an insert that is easy to clean. Also, it slides around on the bathroom floor a good bit. Overall, a very disappointing purchase! We're considering the Baby Bjorn potty chair since it's larger and has an easy to clean insert. So, in summary--if you child is on the small size this potty might work for you. If you have a boy (pee may spill over the front edge) or a larger child, consider something else."
2,'little potty' is too little!,"I wish I had read all of the reviews before purchasing this potty.It is too small for my 2 year old twins. They are good-sized children,and it is too short for them, and the seat is a bit narrow. They nowfight over who will sit on the ""once upon a potty"", which is reallywell designed, and stable too. This little potty would only work for a small, well-coordinated child."
2,Too small for a 2 and 4 year old....,let alone a 6 year old! I was surprised to see how small it is and will be returning it for a larger model. The two stars are for the solid design of the chair. Potty training for an 8 month old?? Wow! if that's your plan then this is your potty chair.
5,Baby Bjorn Little Potty is great!,"We've used this potty to help both of our boys potty learn. They are great because they are one piece (no leaking!) and they are shorter than other potties, which is essential with young learners (both boys were potty trained b age 2). A great product!"
4,Be ware of size!,"This is a great potty, thou my son is yet to do ""his business"" in it. Beware, this potty is tiny!! It is probably great for Elimination Communication (aka Natural Infant Hygiene), since it would be great for small babies, but probably not great for bigger kids. My son is 18 mo and 24 lbs and its too small for him. Its sturdy and easy to move around, but like I said, very small!"
3,Just Okay,"I like that it is one piece and small, but it is too low to the ground for even my 18 month olds to be functional. They have a very difficult sitting on it."
3,Just okay,"I ordered this for use while visiting my parents. It is okay for something like that, but I would not use it for much else.I have a very active 2 year old who does not always want to take time to sit on the potty. She can easily scoot accross the floor while seated on it.It might be good if you have a very early potty trainer or one on the (very) smaller side. My daughter is about 35 inches tall and her knees come to her chest while seated on this."
3,"Nice, but small","This potty is overall OK, my 2.5 year old boy likes to sit on it, it is very small, smaller than I expected I guess, he has actually pooped and filled it up."
5,Great little potty!!,"We received the ""Little Potty"" last Friday for my daughter who turned 11 months on Saturday. It is the perfect size for her as her feet can touch the floor, which is extremely important for potty training. She went pee on it the first time we sat her on it on Friday and pooped in it yesterday for the first time! She'll try to get up from it if she doesn't need to go and also when she has finished her business.Thanks Baby Bjorn and Amazon!"
2,way too small!,"We have the regular-sized Baby Bjorn potty but wanted another one for a second bathroom. This chair is so small, my daughter's knees are up at her shoulders, and she is a very small child. She loves this chair but can't sit in it comfortably for long."
3,Good and bad,"We received this as a gift for our daughter as we are attempting to do infant potty training. The potty works well enough. It's deep enough, the size is right, and the color is cute. A couple of downsides, though.One is that the shine dies really quickly if you use anything even semi-rough to clean it. (This really bothered my wife when I cleaned it with a rough sponge and the shine was gone.)The other major downside is the design in regards to cleanup. You dump all the waste in the toilet, but the curvy edges and shape of the potty make for drips everywhere. When you dump out the waste, it immediately runs down the side of the potty and then start running to the underside edge a bit. I know that it's nice for the potty to have curved and soft edges everywhere for when it comes time for our daughter to actually sit on hit herself, but it sure makes for messy cleanup, unfortunately.Overall, we're glad to have the potty, but those are the downsides we've seen thus far."
4,"Great, but not for my little one","When I found this potty in amazon, I was more than happy because itseemed exactly as same as my ideal image; however, when I actuallygot this, i was little disappointed due to the size. It's smaller than I've expected, and pretty tight for the boys. But overall it is one of the greatest. It's in one piece, so really easy to clean up. Other products, I found in local baby stores, are multi-pieces, so you would need to un-assemble every time of wash, or to put plastic bags on attachable tray to avoid water-cleaning. And also, it is stack-able(if you have two or more), means easy for storing."
3,Not for us,My son who is 2 really liked it at first and would sit in it while reading. When I tried to get him to sit in it without his clothes on he hated it since it was hard plastic. When he got up after less than 5 minutes his bottom had a really dark red ring around where he had been sitting. It just didn't work for us.
5,Great infant potty!,"I bought this for my 4 month old -- who is now almost 11 months old -- when we began practicing Elimination Communication (early infant potty training). The one piece design is great for easy clean-up and also to minimize the baby playing with it when it's not in use (we have a toddler seat that has several pieces and our daughter likes to take it apart more than sit on it). It is nice and low so the baby's feet can touch the floor even when she's very small. The inexpensive price is also great for trying it out. The only criticism I have is that it tends to slide on a wood or tile floor, so I place it on a hand towel. I also wish they made a clear plastic version so I could see when my baby ""goes."""
4,Works great for EC training with my 6 month old!,"Works great, perfect size for my little 6 month girl. She goes potty in it and she is comfortable in it as well. It is also very small and portable so it is great to take around with us everywhere."
3,babybjorn little potty,"i like that this potty is tiny. my daughter's in the 50% for height, and 10% for weight as an 18-month old. it fits her perfectly and will for a while to come. she ends up in a ""squat"" position that is perfect and healthy for having bowel movements.the only thing i don't like about this potty is that it slips around like crazy on the wood floors in our bathroom, making it difficult for her to get really good at positioning herself before sitting down. so now we always put it down on the bath mat and that fixes that problem.there is a potty sold at IKEA for like $4 and it is the same design only slightly larger and it has a no-skid bottom. wish i had bought that one instead, except i don't like supporting IKEA.don't think this tiny potty would work for a boy--pee might splash everywhere as it is not deep. i don't know, never tried it with a boy."
4,Great Potty - very useful for EC,"I bought this potty to use with my infant son who is EC'd. I like it a lot and it saves my back because I would get tired of holding him over other receptacles. With the BBLP, I can just sit him down and support his torso without having to hold all his weight for long stretches of time since it can take a while for him to go.Just note that if you want to see what color your child's eliminations are, the red makes that a little hard to do. Once it is in the big toilet though, I can see it to make sure all is normal."
1,TOO LITTLE,"The picture does not do accurately show this. This potty is for people who want to potty-train infants. My son is only 18 months and short for his age, but he still could not sit on this without his knees being up to his chest. And his little bare bottom was still too big for the seat. I sent them back!"
5,I love it!,"My little girl is very petite-at 12months she only weighs 17lbs. I was afraid that she would fall into the potty! But she fits on it perfectly! It's just her size in fact and she loves it! To my astonishment, the first time she sat on it she pee'd! I'm sure this was coincidence, but it is a tribute to the ease and comfort of the chair I'm sure."
5,best potty for ec!,we love this potty! have been using it since son was just a few months old(he is now almost 2).
5,Just the right size for practicing EC!,"We bought this potty because we are practicing elimination communication with our baby boy. He's 5 months now and this potty is just the right size for him to sit on and have his feet touch the ground. It's completely portable, easy to clean, and the price is right! I think I've already paid for it in diapers we didn't have to buy or wash. I don't know if they made this specifically for the EC'ers, but it sure does work well. The only downside is that the plastic is a little cold on his bum first thing in the morning in the cold months. But I guess the same goes for our toilets too!"
3,"A very good book by MAD, not great though.","This is a very good book! Worth buying, yes I believe so. This is much better than tha MAD About the Movies because it has more flavor and has better comics about the TV world in MAD's perspective. I really like this book, but it doesn't compare to some of the five star work MAD has done with such books as MAD's Bathroom Companion and MAD's Half-Wit & Wisdom of Alfred E. Neumann. If you like TV and Movie spoofs, and you can relate to a lot of them, than this is one to buy! If you are just looking for a laugh, this would be a good book to have, but not before some of the others!"
4,Inspiring but not helpful.,"The incredible work that Graham Rust has produced is not at all a dissapointment. However, he doesn't in the least try to show you how to acheive any of the effects he has created. I have been painting murals for a couple of years and have found it hard to find a resource for learning Trompe Loeil, which would be my passion. I would have greatly appreciated some help from someone I admire in this field. All in all a great portfolio for Graham Rust if you want to pay to see his work, but if looking for a learning tool, this is not it."
4,"Good Art Book, Not a ""How-To"" Book","I purchased this book because it was bundled with ""The Art of Illusion: A Trompe l'Oeil Painting Course."" Although I enjoyed viewing the beautiful, complicated, and skilled work in the photos, it was not the instructional item I thought it would be. Regardless, I like it enough to keep it, although for my purposes, I prefer the other book."
2,Not useful,"Although the work depicted in the photos is incredible, none of it is very useful. Nice to look at - not at all practical for everyday painters."
5,Good Videos,These videos are GREAT for the amatuer beginning to mid-range player. Many of the ideas and concepts are even helpful to the advanced player. I attended her seminar in Las Vegas in 2005.....the concepts taught on the DVD's are just as good as her seminar. A must buy for any beginning to mid-range player regardless of your gender.
5,Outstanding instructional DVDs,I heard that Annie Duke DVDs were the best out there but I was surprised to see for myself how honestly helpful they are for poker players. They are right on the money for all aspects of poker. If you get poker DVDs you owe it to yourself to include Annie's works in your library.
4,great guitar oriented blues disc!,"if you like blues guitar with a hint of pop thrown in, then this cd is for you. scott does a great job of mixing the genres without ever losing the blues side of what he is doing.great guitar tones and wonderful use of a fuzz pedal will allow any guitar player or fan of guitar oriented music really enjoy these songs."
4,Inspiring,"I think Mona new CD is very inspiring and uplifting. I feel it will definetly reach the youths in urban surroundings..I especially like ""Thank you Lord and Get Ready"" track 7 & 3. I think this is very good CD."
1,New vs Old Product,Be careful as Taylor has modified the design and material due to breakage problems with the old style #306 Blue - the new # 309 is black and has a different design and different material. I called before ordering and was assured they were new stock not old but when they were received they were the old ones.
5,"THE LAST METAL OF HONOR, by Pete Billac","Pete Billac obviously cared for Roy and was able to catch the incredible feat the Sgt. Benavidez accomplished.The book could easily be made into a movie, but no one would believe the bravery, dedication to his friends and abilityto survive unbeliveable wounds. This should be required reading for every school child."
3,Not so helpful,"This book mostly just reprints the CE regulations. It answered few of my questions, such as how to get a Product Certificate of Registration, etc."
4,Good job FOGDOG and great seat,"I bought the TEDDY because the weight limit is 10 lbs more than most other seats. I had read the negative review, but thought I could put it together by looking at the picture. The directions ARE in German, but also in English besides 2 other languages. This was the first time I had ever heard of the company KETTLER, went on their website and found that they are a manufacturer of quality items.Also, FOGDOG sent this item to me quickly and in good shape."
5,"An Icon, the best","Lena Machado is an Hawaiian icon, simply the best singer and songwriter of a classical style of Hawaiian music. She is beloved in Hawai'i and has no equal. This CD is a welcome anthology of her great tunes, and covers the length of her career. A must-have for any true fan of Hawaiian music."
3,"I like it, I like it.","In spite of my age, 78 years, I find my CD of the White Stripes music played by a string quartet growing on me each time I play it. I think the quality of the strings is not good, a pity."
2,Disappointed,"Of the five String Quartet Tribute albums that I have bought, this is by far the weakest, despite the involvement of Tom Tally, whose Coldplay string tribute tracks are far superior to the ones found on this album. The melodies seem particularly discordant in places, and I can't help but wish that I'd bought a different string quartet album, or even perhaps the bluegrass tribute."
1,the sound of muzak,"Why is it an honour to be covered by A String Quartet? Anyone can call themselves a string quartet provided they've got four people in one spot holding stringed-instruments. This is White Stripes elevator muzak. If you think simply giving something a 'classical' string treatment affords low-brow rock with some kind of high-brow prestige you don't really love or understand music at all, and you're buying into a bogus notion of orthodoxy. On the other hand, if you're a large business who plans to keep callers on hold for hours on end, buy this now. It'll make a nice change from Vivaldi."
5,Poor Lotta!,"Lotta, the youngest in the family, dreams that her sister and brother are bothering her favorite stuffed animal. She wakes up furious with them, and will not believe that they are innocent. On top of that, her mother tells her to wear a sweater that is itchy and scratchy. She starts to alter the sweater, and after trying unsuccessfully to even up the damage, completely destroys it. Of course her mother is angry. Since no one in the family appreciates her, she runs away to the neighbor's garage loft. The neighbor graciously lets Lotta ""move in.""Fans of ""Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day"" and Beverly Cleary's Ramona series will enjoy Lotta's story. The writing flows well both for read-aloud as well as beginning readers. As an elementary school library media specialist, I have recommended this book to many students and parents."
2,Too Small,"These bowls look good, but I totally agree with another reviewer that they are way too small for a realistic size serving portion. 10 oz. is a stretch to say the least. If all you want is a taste of something, these would work. But for a meal or even side dish sized portion, these are just too small. Had they been in a larger size they would have been really nice."
1,to small,"to small for any type of soup bowl, save your money and look else where these wont work at all to serve soup"
3,Onion soup crock,The set of 4 were restaurant style quality and the single ones weren't! Next time I'll buy 2 sets of 4 restaurant style!
5,WLP- Up there with Coldplay,"As I was getting comfortable in my spot, waiting for Better than Ezra to play at JazzFest this year, I had to sit through a little known band(one that i had never heard of) called World Leader Pretend. WOW!!! What a blessing!!! This band blew me away as they played such beautiful music with such emotion and energy. Their songwriting is top notch; and when people ask me what they sound like, I tell them Coldplay with a little bit of Radiohead thrown in. Lemme tell you, these boys are refreshing, and at age 20!! - they're sure gonna make something of themselves in the music industry. Punches is my most anticipated CD of the summer and I'm gonna get it the first day it comes out. Rubble...Bouts has just 4 songs to hold you over until Punches comes out, but man are they some good ones!! Get it!"
2,It Goes On Way Too Long!,"A good cast, Jack Lemmon in particular, and nice 1964 San Francisco color locations are wasted on a romantic comedy that at 130 minutes goes on WAY too long! It starts pleasantly enough but after about 100 minutes you just want it to be over. The last half hour is both silly and boring and leads to an unsatisfying finish that you could see coming an hour earlier. I suspect undemanding 1964 audiences found this amusing enough but it doesn't play all that well in 2012. I wanted to like this one a lot more than I ultimately did, I do realize mine is a minority opinion."
1,Good neighbor sam,"It would help if the dvd case AND the movie wasnt mislabeled! I got the wrong movie, called cust service, and told them about it. They said they would send a new one but refused to check it first. Wrong again! I ended up getting it at the library for free. Bottom line, they would rather send it wrong twice and have me deal with the returns than check it once. Customer service? I dont think they uunderstand the concept."
1,beware-labeling glitch,"I ordered this DVD recently, and when I pressed ""play"" for the first time, I discovered that it was not, in fact, ""Good Neighbor Sam,"" as labeled, but was actually ""Operation Mad Ball"" ; a regrettable error on the part of the packagers. I have not returned it because having a copy of ""Operation Mad Ball"" is not a bad thing, but hesitate to re-order because the next copy of ""Good Neighbor Sam"" may have the same issue. Beware. ""newdoc"""
4,FINALMENTE!!! On DVD!!! It's about time...,"Remember my review about the Jack Lemmon set where you had to take certain flics you did not prefer? Well i guess they finally heard me and released this great Lemmon flic all by itself... We all thank you from the bottom of our ""Boogity - Boogity shoes"". Can u guess from what oldies classic those words are from? A slight hint... the year was 1961... Good luck!"
4,A most funny and enjoyable movie.,"I agree that a DVD of this movie MUST be produced and soon; my reasons are that we live in a Country where the PAL system is used in VHS but fortunately all our DVD players here are produced multi-zoned and therefore can very successfully use the NTSC version in DVD. I remember this movie and have wanted to own it for sometime - it was/is to my mind, a very funny story and Jack Lemmon is as always, very entertaining. Please - a DVD version is a MUST - and soon."
2,Very Average,I DIg me Some Maceo parker but I Prefer His Stage Work to His Studio Albums especially of Late.AN Album Like This Say if It were Put out by Kenny G.Would Be Considered Good but From Maceo it's down right Average.Coin Toss&Rabbits In The Pea Patch are Good.The Prince Tracks didn't Work for His Own Album So they are not Happening Here at all.I Wanna Hear Him Rock With Bootsy.He Deserves To Be Showcased Properly.this isn't it.
2,Check out Southern Comfort Instead,"Maceo is not at his best on this CD. The guest artists do nothing to advance his sound and, at times, make it a whole lot worse."
1,Not recommended,"Maceo Parker teaming up with Sheryl Crow, James Taylor and Ani DiFranco? What is the world coming to?"
1,Maceo went for the money,"Can you blame him? Oh well, another to recycle. He is definitely a man, though."
5,Best Intentions turn out even better,"This book was originally conceived and written as an Advent Devotional by the authors but can be used, as I have used it, as a devotional for any period when you need to know that God cares about you and your problems or issues. Written in a personable, practical style, Salt and Light brings a common sense approach to two men's walk with God, and how they are sharing their unique vision with their family and friends. From ""the grass is always greener over the septic tank"" and the often quoted but never improved on ""Pray, read your bible and love Jesus"" both men show that you can use this practical guide on many levels, and enjoy growing closer to God with each one."
5,Salt and Light,"This is such a great devotional. It was very hard to stop at just one devotional. I found myself continuing to read on and I realized that I had gone into another days devotion. But this is ok because I just kept re-reading which is a good thing to do! I have recommended the book and have given copies to others. Their reaction is Thank You so much for such a great inspirational book. It is not like other devotionals, which may not hold your attention, and cause you to reflect on each devotion. Everyone I have talked to that has read the book simply loves the book."
5,Sublime,"Amongst all four Lila Downs releases so far, there is little doubt in my mind that this one remains an all time favorite.Needless to say, I have become a huge fan, and all CDs by Lila and her fabulous band fully deserve five stars, period. But this one is the most indengenious one, the one of her roots, where her true character and amibition shine through in its most pure form.I especially adore songs like La Sandunga with its magic touch, or Naila, maybe because I am a bit a sentimental guy. Anyway - buy all of her CD's, but give this one a special listen.Hopefully, she will never burn out and continue with her wonderful voice and the intelligence and subtelty of her almost dylanesque or even taupinian lyrics.Sublime."
4,Good enough,"The music on this is good and the filming adequate, it held my interest. I wish more could be put on one DVD, it was too short."
3,not the colors shown,"I love this type of golf ball, especially for a woman with a slower swing speed. It gives me much more distance. However, I was looking forward to getting the colors shown in pic, two of the colors were not included: the green and the peach."
4,Superman Archives Stories in Showcase Presents,"Potential buyers might like to know that all 20 stories in Superman: Man of Tomorrow Archives: Volume 1, as listed by a previous reviewer, appear in Showcase Presents Superman: Volume 1. The stories in Showcase are in black and white, not colour, and the volume includes many more Superman tales from the Superman and Action comics. People who have already acquired Showcase Presents Superman: Volume 1 might like to consider whether or not they wish to buy the same stories (in colour) in the Superman: Man of Tomorrow Archives: Volume 1."
3,Missing Important Items,Item did have the minimal damage for a used receiver. However the receiver did not come with the card or the remote(costing me more money). In the end I feel it would of been a better buy if I would of just purchased a new receiver.
2,bought it and couldn't use it,"I was very excited to have found this receiver, but found out I couldn't use it. I had to go through the hassle of returning it, and probably won't get the shipping back that I had to pay to return it. That's okay though. The receiver I'm sure is okay and would have worked fine. Directv said I couldn't use it - not the vendor. The vendor was very nice and apologized for the trouble. Just have to be careful and check things out thoroughly before buying next time."
3,don't bother,"For the last few YEARS, all direcTV hardware is lease only(since 2006?).So, if you MUST go outside DirecTV to buy your box, understand that, even if you manage to get one that ISN'T delinquent, and can successfully setup and use it with your card, it's still considered leased by the company, and they may come take the box when/if you cancel service.At the very least, pay with a credit card, so you have consumer fraud protection on your side.Occasionally need to unplug, and reconnect power to get the box working again after power-outage. If it takes more than 2-3 min to return to full function, unplug, wait 30 seconds, and re-plug.Crap-all for using with mythbuntu. USB port has some real issues that make it not worth while. If forced to use this box, go for an IR blaster option. save yourself the headache.Bottom line.Minuses No highdef, no harddrive, outdated technology.Pluses Does exactly what it was designed for, solid build, and OK universal remote."
2,Doesn`t work,Got box and when tryed to use it it wouldn`t work cause it`s still on someone else`s case the person who sold it to me still owes money for it I would like to get my money back and ship it back if I can if so I will need a box and a address label to ship it with or at lest an address. GOD BLESS have a good day .
1,direct tv reciever,Recieved reciver in a short period of time however remote would not work on reciever direct tv sent someone out and reciever was bad.Infared eye in reciever will not work.
5,ITEM WAS DELIVERED FAST!! I RECOMMEND BUYING FROM THIS SELLER!!,"THIS ITEM WAS DELIVERED FAST AND IT WAS IN GOOD SHAPE!! EVEN THOUGH DIRECTV DIDN'T LET ME USE IT, I STILL RECOMMEND BUYING FROM THIS SELLER!! THANKS AGAIN"
5,I was surprised - It is so very easy to install,"Just like modern day computers - plug and play. Just activate the card that comes with it, and you're ready to go. It was easy to program, and the quality of picture is as good as the picture I get from my Direct TV installed receiver."
2,Too Predictable,"This is the first novel I've read by this author, and it might be the last. I've had this book in my collection for awhile, so I finally decided to pick it up. However it might have been better off continuing to collect dust.I found it hard to stick with it in the beginning and there were a few instances when I back tracked a few pages, wondering if I had missed something, for when I read into some action I was like, 'Whoa, where did this come from.' The characters were too flat and all over the place with their actions and opinions/beliefs. As in my headline, the plot was also too predictable and there was only one instance where I was taken by surprise; read this near garbage of a novel if you want to know what that is (about 2/3's the way through).I will likely be wary of this author in the future. Hopefully something out there in her collection of 20 books can redeem her somewhat."
2,Not worth your time,"I just finished reading this book. I ordered it online here at Amazon used for 25 cents. I normally love stories with srong female POV. So this book seemed to have the right recipe- princess on the run from her father, disguised as male knight, has adventures and falls in love. However the characterization is flat. The heroine is one dimensional, and there is a weird mystic theme that would be appropriate for a fantasy but seems odd in a book labeled historical fiction."
1,The Return of The Native,"I was never so dissapointed in a movie. Not only did they change the time and location,but they even changed the names of the title characters. The acting was terrible. Thomas Hatdy would have been unable to recognize it."
4,Jigsaws Galore,This puzzle has given me hours of entertainment. I have loved jigsaws all my life and now that they are computerized it makes my life easier. No puzzle pieces lost on the floor or taking up space on the dining room table. I can sit with my laptop every evening and watch TV and do my puzzles. They are beautifully layed out and when finished are georgeous.
3,Need more puzzles with more pieces,I like the Jigsaw Galore puzzles but am disappointed that there are so few of them compared to other puzzle DVD's I have had in the past. I also wish that they had more pieces per puzzle.
3,for a child,very cute granddaughter looked cute. they were not very serviceable as they tore a hole in them at first wearing
4,Great New Composer,"I saw Jeremy perform live, and I just had to have the CD. He is a wonderful performer- great voice- and it's all captured on the CD. I think that we will be hearing a lot about him very soon. I definitely recommend this CD!"
2,outdated edition,No copyright date was given in the information. This version is over 20 years old. A newer version exists. The newer version is what I was expecting
2,So-So Cookbook,"This book is so-so. I like that it is illustrated but the dishes are mediocre. The recipes are simple so that is great but often the ingredients or methods are not the best so the dishes don't come out as well as they could. I do like the fact that there are color pictures in the front and the recipes are in the remainder of the book. As an experienced cook, the recipes themselves could be much better. The Good Housekeeping Great Baking book is excellent though. So I can't attribute the deficiencies to the series. This one just misses the mark. Good thing I got it free."
5,Hardcover cookbook,"Although the picture here has a red spot on the cover stating, ""First time in paperback"" this really is a hardcover book as stated in the description."
4,Good Housekeeping Cookbook,"I recently purchased this cookbook as the newer version of the same book I was given as a bride 40 years ago, and I must say I was disappointed by the illustrations in the book. This is still an excellent 'Beginning level' cookbook, but the pictures are in short supply and instead you are given 'illistrations'. Not quite as nice"
1,Not what I thought it was!,"I bought this video thinking it was a Spanish language edition of the great PBS kids cartoons. It is NOT! It is the scholastic series - there are 7 stories (only 1 is curious george). The one about Curious George isn't animated; it shows pictures from the book. My son was expecting the cute animated George and this video doesn't keep his attention. Scholatic does great videos - but this one isn't. Hope this review helps so you can not make the same mistake I did!!Este video no es lo mismo que el Jorge Curious de PBS. Este video contiene 7 cuentos, pero solo uno es de Jorge. El cuento de Jorge no es animado - muestren unos fotos del libro solamente. Fue una desilusion y a mi hijo no le gusta. Espero que esto le ayude a no comprar este producto sin saber lo que deberas vas a recibir."
2,not what I expected,This dvd isn't true dvd. It's illustrations with a voice talking in background. So kind of wierd. If I had known I wouldn't have bought it. But my son still likes to watch it from time to time. He's 3 1/2.
5,t,"I work at the zoo with the Apes. I am always looking for something on DVD or in book form to donate for our silent auction every year. I especially love the Orangs and it is hard to find DVD's or books about them. Getting better, though. Don't eat anything with Palm Oil in it."
4,Out of the coconut shell,"Josephine Chia's book `Frog under a coconut shell' is a wonderful book. This book is indeed a tribute to her mother's courage, vision, and perseverance under daunting circumstances. She writes that she is her mother's hope and dreams and the readers of this book will agree that she has fulfilled her mother's dreams.I have been living here, in Singapore, for the past 27 years and yet it is fascinating to read about Josephine's account of her life and experiences in Singapore during the 1950s and 1960s. There's no doubt Josephine is a master storyteller. She glides smoothly from one decade to another with amazing ease. Her superb skill in describing places and events is evident throughout the book. She tells the story in a captivating manner in her unique voice. It is a very interesting, informative, and touching book. Every good book is supposed to leave a lasting impression on reader's mind and this book does it beautifully."
2,"Well constructed case, power supply cables too short","Antec has always been known for its quality products. This case is no exception: plenty of ventilation, rubber vibration isolators, and all that jazz.Still, Antec has managed to make mistakes.The cablesfrom the power supply unit are simply too short. The SATA power supply cables are too short, as is the 4-pin 12V. Be prepared to spend another $30 on extension cables.If not for this silly shortcoming, I would have rated the case higher."
4,Great rackmount case,"This case is well made. I'm very happy with it. The power supply cables to the motherboard could have been longer by 4-6 inches however. With the Intel motherboard I used, one of the cables (the 4 pronged motherboard power cable) is such a tight fit, it's like a tightrope."
2,Boring,"I was expecting the new British call girl movie. But I watched it anyways and it was slow and not very engaging. Also not any nudity. Which was the reason I wanted this movie. Maybe the time frame the movie was set in and the stereotypes of the film were good at the time it was made, but didn't work for the 200's"
1,"If you enjoy science, skip this one!","Anyone with even a reasonable science or computer background will flinch quickly upon reading this. Hard to finish and Im sorry I did.Half the book just made up ""metaphysics"" to fill gaps, and even a lot of that didnt hold logic against itself either.Its as if a fantasy writer tried to write scifi, and to fill the gaps (which are huge in this book) they just made stuff up without bothering to see if it was believable."
3,Packaging?,"Who looked at the packaging for this DVD set and decided ""This is a good idea.""How do you possibly expect these DVDs to not be damaged?What's wrong with the regular DVD cases other people use when making multiple DVD sets?"
4,WSX - great in its own right,"WSX is over the top, it's even cheesy at times, but still, it's purely entertaining and innovative in its own right. It has had its great moments and unquestionably some mighty skilled talents between the ropes. It's sad that WWE haven't already recruited some of the guys that showed of some great high-spot wrestling in WSX. At least I have heard that WWE had some tryouts with Matt Sydal, but I can be mistaken.Long story short, WSX derserves to have its respected place in wrestling history, even if the approach to our beloved sport was a little ""different"", to say the least.If Vince McMahon would consider to change the current ECW into something fresh (which is essential in my opinion), he should go the WSX-direction, especially in times the amount of so-called hardcore-wrestling is very thin in WWE - at best he would incorporate some of the talent and bookers behind WSX, they derserved it."
2,A Word of Warning,"This DVD briefly mentions and shows just two ghost towns (Bodie, California and Garnet, Montana). It spends almost the entire video in showing how they are restoring log cabins in Montana and mining for gold in California and the process used for mining for gold. While these all may be interesting subjects, they are barely mentioning the ghost towns themselves. The length of the DVD is under an hour. They probably spent less than five minutes actually showing and telling about the ghost towns and only mention two. For the money being charged for this DVD, you might want to think twice before purchasing it."
2,Not really about ghost towns!,"The title is very misleading. It really is NOT about ghost towns, but about mining!!! The History Channel had a decent shot at this, but blew it. Save your money"
3,Interesting Protest Novel,Interesting novel that takes place within 4 days and includes multiple flashbacks. Interesting perspective and first-hand account of the Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa
3,A Thought Provoking Read,"This little book can be packed into a handbag or briefcase and read enroute to anywhere. BUT, it has to be read carefully and slowly because it is a call to action. It should be read and reread because its message is one of peace, global peace. It is not an easy message to take in because the violence and associated poverty, disease, and death is all around us and is overwhelming. Where and how can one begin to make a difference? Father Dear brings out illuminating examples of nonviolence achieving peace and resolution from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy Day, Gandhi and Cesar Chavez, among others. We can gain insight from these examples and gain courage from Mary, who taught Jesus everything she knew about prayer, about love. Father Dear is actually speaking in this book. It is written in a style that is like a homily, a personal plea. It is not scholarly or preachy. I myself, have to read it again and meditate on action."
2,Not up to date,"I wouldn't exactly call this up to date over the 2ndedition. It's a decent book, but if you have the 2ndedition already, I'd recommend skipping this one.If you want only one guide, buy Michael Jackson'sawesome guide. There are tons of omissions in this edition.No Highland Park 18yr, none of the Bowmore editions(Darkest, Dawn, Dusk, Claret, etc), no Dalmore Cigar Malt,no Glenfarclas 17 yr, Glenfiddich 30, Laphroaig 30,and many more. The independent listings are hit andmiss to say the least, but he seems to keep other listingsin the book for expressions that are long gone and nolonger available. I guess the authors needed the money."
4,Great deal in my opinion.,"I don't know how in the world they offer all this stuff for this price, but they do! I was skeptical, but I ordered anyway, because at this price, what have you got to lose? The battery alone is worth that. At the verizon store an extra battery is $39.99, and a car charger is $29.99(I think). That's $70.00! This battery fits perfect and functions perfect, and it even has that nice chocolate ""shine"" to it. The car charger and home charger aren't as high quality as the lg ones, but they get the job done just the same. If you are gonna use your chocolate as an mp3 player, you are gonna need this package, or at least something similar, because the chocolate's battery life is notoriously short. I am completely satisfied. The 4 stars instead of 5 is because the quality of the chargers is not quite as good as the standard lg brand."
4,Almost perfect trail shoe,"I'm on my second pair of these; they are the best trail shoes I've ever used, offering amazing control and grip on muddy trails and all sorts of terrain. The water resistant shell makes them ideal for wet trails, but in hotter weather will make your feet sweat. They are not good on concrete, especially wet, and are not as durable as I would like them to be, but I will not hesitate to buy another pair when the current one need to be replaced."
5,excellent sea story and also excellent lesson in industrial safety,"I'll skip what everyone else talked about. This is a *great* book for sailors, pilots, and anyone else concerned with transportation/industrial safety. It shows, in detail, how a system can be designed to be dangerous and yet consistently blame the victims. Oh - don't forget - it IS a great and heartbreaking story as well. I love wreck diving, but after reading this I am not sure I can dive this wreck."
4,Gift for my son,"This book was purchased as a gift for my son. He is a merchant marine, and currently out on a voyage. This book will be something for him to enjoy when he returns."
1,This book is DOA,"Be advised, believe it or not, this book is ALL text. There are absolutely NO photos, maps, charts, or drawings. How can you possibly tell the story of a ship sinking with nothing but text? The Marine Electric had a fascinating history as a WW2 T-2 tanker that was converted into a bulk freighter. Where are the builder's photos? WW2 era shots? Conversion diagrams or plans? The navigation charts showing the wreck site? This book was obviously written by an amateur, you can tell by the rambling, over the top prose, lengthy, asides that distract from the story line, and the lack of willingness to research and pay for photos and other visual aids. The book is written for someone unfamiliar with ships and the sea since it goes into explanations of the simplest marine terms that most people interested in reading the book would already know. $24.95 brand new? I don't think so Tim. Buy it used and don't pay more than $7.00 with shipping. I bought it sight unseen, what a dissapointment!"
2,A Discovery Item Only - Not a Musical Instrument,"I picked this up for my 5 year old son who has a strong interest in music. While he loves this thing and hammers away on it like a rock star, he can't play yet so he doesn't know that it barely qualifies as a musical instrument. It is very difficult to tune and falls back out of tune almost instantly. Plus the bridge is garbage and keeps losing screws, I'm constantly screwing it back together. Once my son is ready to sit down and take lessons, I'll have to buy him a real guitar. This thing did serve it's purpose though, at least now I know my son is truely interested but I do wish I put my money towards a Fender instead."
3,decent,Decent compilation. Nothing groundbreaking. Your typical techno dance stuff. The annoying sound clips between songs brings this one star down. Not everyone is into the whole silly rave scene.
4,Jerry lets you know...,"it is great to hear the joy behind the music, jerry is very vocal as well as the others. Very excellent cover songs on this disc."
2,too loose,"Guess I was hoping for ""Shady Grove 2."" The ""appetizers"" are just fluff; when they're on my attention wanders away from the CD and I find other things to do besides listen. It's hard to come back after this happens several times. The tight professionalism and musicianship that made ""Shady Grove"" so thrilling is missing here; cameraderie and noodling that warm the personal, psychedelic side of the session are there instead. The CD is a good piece of a collection for Jerry cultists, and I'm an indefatigable and unrepentant Deadhead, so I like this CD to death.But I'd bought an extra copy for a bluegrass-playing friend, and I don't think I'm going to give it to him after all."
5,"This is raw, unedited acoustic bliss.","This is raw, unedited acoustic bliss.If you love music and REALLY GOOD recordings..the stuff that makes you feel like you're sitting a few inches away from the musicians, this is an album that should be underneath your pillow at night. Elating in almost every fashion, this will take you to those musical clouds the almighty sits on.Really folks, don't pass this hidden treasure (literally) up. It's a no-regret buy."
4,Just a Lot of Fun,"If you're looking for momentous statements or seamless production, then look elsewhere; however, this is the CD to buy if you just want to hear three very talented, very amiable musicians jamming on some old tunes and making good music. You certainly don't have to be a Deadhead to enjoy these songs - but it definitely helps if you're a fan of bluegrass. The song selections are impeccable, and some of the banter is pretty funny, mostly Garcia's comments. This CD is just another reminder of the musical giant we lost, almost six years gone by now. Wow! - but of course, the music never stopped."
1,Not so much.,"I am a bluegrass fan, love Tony's stuff, hated this album. There is some excellent pickin' on the disc by tony, but I was dissapointed. Garcia shouldn't be allowed to sing bluegrass. He sounded like a stuck pig to me. If you are a huge Rice fan or a deadhead maybe you could appreciate some of this, but i found it to be a let down. I wouldn't recommend it to any bluegrass fans, maybe you need to be a big Garcia fan to be able to stand that singing. Rice doesn't sing at all on this disc."
2,"Great picking, lousy singing","A wonderful selection of songs with great guitar and mandolin playing by all. However there are only about three tracks on this CD, which must have recorded at a different time than the rest, in which you can listen to Jerry's singing without cringing. It is just awful. The instrumental tracks all all excellent but I could have done without the banter between the songs. A close call between 2 and 3 stars."
1,Mediocre,"This is just a poor, poor album. Jerry Garcia is the most overrated singer in all of Rock 'n' Roll. Try ""Stage Fright"" by THE BAND instead."
4,tasty,"if you like the shady grove cd you will like this one to.it has some pretty cool takes of some old songs.the versions of LONG BLACK VEIL,ROSALEE MCFALL and AMAZING GRACE really stand out to me.dont get me wrong their is not a weak track on here.its a very layed back cd. you can tell these guys where haveing fun jamming.i am not saying this because JERRY GARCIA is playing on this cd,because i am not a GREATFUL DEAD fan.TONY RICE and DAVID GRISMAN are a enough reason to get this one,but JERRYS vocals add a little something extra."
4,Interesting Railroad Story,"While I couldn't give this DVD five stars like the Imperial Express or The Great South Pacific Express, it is an interesting railroad story nonetheless. It's a little too heavy on the interview with the founder of Rovos Rail which detracted from the train.However, it's very interesting to learn that the founder was originally seeking a ""rolling home"" of sorts and started by buying one railroad passenger car, then a few more, then a locomotive, then some unused yards and turned it into a luxury train operation with 170 employees. The cars have the largest private rooms of any train anywhere (at least according to the video) and is all-vintage.It also looks like for part of the journey the train is pulled by an electric locomotive, but it is not seen. Only the steam locomotives which are quite nice anyway. There's some good pacing and aerial shots during the second half of the show.Overall, a nice story of one man's travel quest and how he got into the luxury train business."
1,I agree!!!!,With most that have written reviews on Blackbeards Ghost. I would give it a negative -5 if it were possible. Its that BAD!
4,Our kids loved it--laughed out loud many times!,"Our children, 7 years old to teenagers, thought this movie was very funny. The movie is filled with silly scenes involving an invisible ghost and the trouble he causes: a motorcylce drives by itself, athletes do amazing things, etc. It is has a similar feel to ""The Absent Minded Professor"" (Flubber). Lots of silly fun!"
2,"Cute movie, Bad DVD","I enjoyed the movie. Ustinov was soo funny he made the movie for me. Of course the movie is pretty inane, but I knew that before I bought it. What I didn't know is that the DVD quality is the worst I have ever seen. The sound also had scratches and pops. The picture is faded and streaked. I like these kinds of movies, but I now look to the reviews before I buy Disney movies. For the cost I think they could restore them (and in general make them widescreen)."
1,what was disney thinking????,"I can`t even think of words that could descibe this awful release. disney has had a great track record for putting out great DVD`s. This ain`t one of them, buyer beware. in fact i would give this a negative 5 stars if this were posible. I pray disney will pay more attention to these films and give them respect and proper treament they deserve!!!"
4,Great fun,"I have read other reviews complaining about the quality and sound on this dvd. We have experienced no problems in that regard on the DVD we have received. The sound and quality is fine.This classic movie is funny. My children have laughed and laughed at it. There are no bad words, no iffy scenes, nothing that would get me to turn off this movie and not allow my children to watch it.Fair warning though, the pirate Blackbeard does like his drink.This is just one of the old Disney classics that is a lot of fun to watch. Enjoy"
1,A Disney Favorite Compromised,"While we were thrilled to see that one of our favorite Disney comedies was scheduled for DVD release, we were dismayed by Disney's refusal to treat its films (and its fans) with respect. Why aren't Disney DVD's released in their original theatrical ratios? The new ""Vault Disney"" titles are simply wonderful, and while we agree that this title might not merit an elobrate release of that nature, it does deserve to be seen in widescreen. Disney could simply release both versions on the same disc and please everyone. We won't buy this DVD until it is released in widescreen."
1,Great Disney Fun! However......,"A great family Disney film for all. Peter Ustinov (Logan's Run) provides great fun as ""Blackbeard""!Movie = 5 StarsNo Widescreen (As it should be seen) = 0 Stars.Doesn't Disney Studios ever get it?!?"
3,Good Story / Good character acting / Poor picture/sound quality.,"As the title implies, if it weren't for the picture and sound quality of this DVD, I would give it 5 stars. It's a great little flick - good comedy; and, Ustinov plays his part perfectly. Too bad DISNEY couldn't have improved the picture/sound quality before releasing it. Anyhow, it is ""a keeper."""
2,"disney, why are you editing & censoring?","the complaints about this dvd release are all correct. great movie, low qaulity release. yet i'm surprised no one has mentioned the thing that angered me most, the self censorship. the bataan race scene where ustinov swaps the bataan for a bottle of beer. we're ok to witness a pirate being drunk, but a sports commentator saying a teenager is running with a bottle of beer is beyond appropriate? what are the execs at disney thinking? if they need to put out a disclaimer by leonard maltin befor showing such ""questionable"" material as they did with many of the vault collection... fine, but stop chopping up the movies. our ten year old children are not buying these movies, many of us were actually alive to see the originals and no we're being ripped off. stop angering a loyal fan base with this ignorance. keep this in mind when you contemplate the inevitable release of a cleaned up widescreen version of this title."
1,Disney shipwrecks this pirate.,"I am so disappointed. I have crystal childhood memories of sitting in a darkened theater as the tale of Blackbeard's Ghost was told. All the silliness and charm of Peter Ustinov, Dean Jones, and the wonderful Suzanne Pleshette are present in this release on DVD, but sadly, Disney has really screwed up on this one. Not only is the film not offered in it's widescreen format, nor are there any interesting extras on the disc (not even the trailer!) but absolutely NO care has been taken in transferring the film to DVD. The picture quality is mediocre at best, with obvious scratches and even frequent instances when a peculiar purple haze passes over the screen. Disney should be embarrassed. Rent it - don't buy it."
5,Paige's Birthday,"My daughter is vegan and I didn't know how I was going to give her a birthday cake without compromising her food choices. I found Orgran cake mix by accident, a very lucky accident. The cake was so good my husband and son never knew until I told them it was vegan."
3,It's Just Okay,"I really wanted to like this cake mix, particularly since I had to buy it in bulk to get it, but it has an odd taste to it. The sweetness of the product is not your typical sugar sweet. I suspect it comes from a fruit juice based sweetener that they use. I can't honestly recommend this over other cake mixes out there. There are better choices."
2,Deceiving,"Was not at all impressed with the bag - the Prada wallet I bought last year was/is almost as big as the handbag and doesn't fit inside, but at least my Nikon camera does, a Kleenex and some coins!"
1,Unsure of Authenticity,"I recently purchased two of these bags, and when they arrived, I discovered several disconcerting differences. The intensity of the black color of the nylon varies, the Prada logo plate is in different places, the certificates of authenticity are blurry, and both registration numbers match. Shouldn't the numbers be different on each bag? I contacted Amazon, and the representative in India was of no assistance. Neiman Marcus told me over an internet chat that they would be unable to assist in authenticating the bags. I have contacted the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition regarding the problem. Anyone have any ideas of how to authenticate this bag? I have a black light for validation purposes, and nothing on the bag glows."
1,Defect Item,"I received the item that has no zipper. I contacted the customer service and requested a replaced item. He said he will ship a replacement if they have one on stock. After the search, they were out of stock. I requested to have similar bag with same price, but different color. The CSR's response is no way that they can do that. THERE IS NO WAY!! What a service!! With this bad product with this kind of service, I don't think I will order from Amazon."
3,disappointed,Must have overlooked the fine print. Thought it was syrup derived from the Walnut tree. It was just corn syrup with roasted walnuts. Big difference. Am still looking for a syrup derived exclusively from the Black Walnut tree. My understanding is that it is the best of all syrups.
3,Okay sort of book,This author uses an entirely different approach to the teaching of materials science. This book was well-written and accessible. A good text on a rather drab subject.
1,Elements of Materials Science and Engineering (6th Edition) (Purchased on 02/02/2011),I am thinking of suing Amazon and Adison & Wesley for sending me JUNK REPRODUCTION of this wonderful book (which was my text book in my MTech Course). It is shocking to receive a appalling reproduction of this great book which starts on PAGE ; Believe me it is page 9. It is badly bound!!!!!!!!!! The pages of the book are worse than what my simple photo copy machine can do. The diagrams are illegible. And for this I paid US $ 130 plus and S$ 180 plus??????????????I am trying to send mails to Amazon and no one is replying to me except with this request for this review. Here is my review and I am cautioning people not to buy this book till they sort out this mess. I am also trying to call Adison Wesley here and I am not getting any reasonable reply so far.I am going to complain to Mr Van Vlaack as well about this deplorable reproduction of his wonderful book.This is disgusting!!!!!!!Gabriel
2,Lacking,"This book is too expensive for its content. It is merely an overview of the Material Science. For more in depth understanding, supplemental material had to be provided my professor."
2,Poor quality of production detracts from excellent book,"This book presents a classical structure-property overview of materials. Its treatment of microstructure, phase transformations, and transport is excellent. Since early editions, the author has added overviews of electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Examples and end-of-chapter problems are thorough and appropriate for undergraduates. I wish it offered a more comprehensive coverage of processing - particularly deposition processing and powder processing. However, this edition is dated (1989) and the publisher is apparently using reproduction rather than quality-print technology. The $95 price tag is completely out of line for the poor quality of reproduction offered. Accordingly, I can not recommend it for an undergraduate text book."
1,Elements of materials science and engineering,"Avoid this book at all costs. I have reviewed/studied over 2,000 engineering/technical manuals/coursebooks/references and this one is one of the absolutely most confusing piecemeal pieces of garbage I have ever seen. At the time of my first acquaintance with this textbook, 1976, as a first year engineering college student I quickly realized that over 50% of my classmates were either hopelessly confused by the mumbo-jumbo presentation of material or were borrowing their frat brothers/ sorority sisters notes/tests to pass the course. Couple this with the instructor's strict adherence to the text and it resulted in the highest failure rate/largest drop-out yield in the history of my school. I have recently reviewed the text once again and as a seasoned engineer may only offer the same advice."
3,not very well desinged,"As far as educational value for assembling an electrical DC motor with my 7 year old it served its purpose. She learned about motors. However, the quality of the parts is on the cheap side and the pieces not always fit properly. The biggest disappointment was using it as a boat. That was terrible. The boat sank immediately if I arranged the components as shown in the picture in the box. I had to put the battery case apart and under the motor to balance the load properly to avoid sinking the boat. The propeller is a joke and can barely move the boat. I bought it mainly for its educational purposes and not as a boat but at least I was expecting a boat that does not sink so easily."
2,Thin book for a thick subject,"This book contains some good abstract information, butdoes not cover it comprehensively. I would recommend youlook for another resource."
3,General overview,"The book starts out with good details on some of the keywords, but seems to give big examples, with brief explanations toward the end of the book. I was hoping for a bigger book, with better examples."
5,A great book!,"Ray Wikstrom puts it on paper what most of us feel! The heads of all branches of government should read it. When I read Ray's book I thought of mayself. He is preaching to the choir! Only the choir isn't singing! Ray is the one singing. The silent majority in America are thinking as Ray is but we are too quiet about our displeasure with todays leaders and with lack of responsibility and the eroding of family and citizen values. ""Purpose"" is extremely well written but it is not a cleancut answer to solving our countries' decline in values. Asking the question, as Ray has, what is the purpose of law,rules,discipline, manors,actions, values and conduct ,as though we are effecting lives and attitudes in a positive way and can turn the corner to bring back basic values,We see a meed for change and reform!"
2,Visually Concept Applied to Server 2000,"I barely used this book at all when I studied for and passed the Server 2000 exam. I think the Visually concept worked best when it was first developed and one could get a large dimension book on Excel or Access and see in beautiful color screen shots everything with minimal explanation. Then one would follow up and see the same thing on their monitor. It was a great introduction, particularly with Excel.But then over time the Visually concept changed and in my estimation lost some of its teaching power. In this book, for example, you get inundated with black and white screen shots in tiny font. It's what you'd see on your monitor except much smaller and therefore the font is tiny and hard on the eyes. Plus it's in black and white. This was a very unpleasant way to learn and hence, I barely got anything out of this book and used much better resources."
4,Intriguing,"This new series (well not really new) by Elaine Cunnighman is a fresh new start. It is really intriguing because we have this P.I. as the main character who is on case that stretches out to reveal her past. Gwen, doesn't know much at all about her parents because they died when she was a baby, but there is more to their deaths than what she is led to believe. But as she starts to uncover her past and the secrets that ulitmately lead her to solving her case, lives become at stake. Including the life of someone close to Gwen. Overall it is not that bad of a novel, there is just a lot character confusion because there are so many. Although it is not too hard to follow."
2,"Too much urban, not enough fantasy","I'm not a fan of cop dramas and detective mysteries, and that's basically what this book is. There is a tiny bit of fantasy here, but it's barely noticeable. I couldn't connect with the story at all. It seemed fragmented and confusing throughout, then we find out everything is connected in a far fetched way towards the end. I really struggled to finish this book. At no point did I feel interested in anything going on. The romantic relationship between the main character and her ex was painful to read. I skipped entire sections related to that, and I didn't miss much. Maybe this story just isn't my thing. Judgmental cops and convoluted mysteries are not my cup of tea."
2,big disappointment,"Ok, there always has to be one the crowd that did not like the book and so that would be me. 95% of the book was her doing boring investigation work, goes here & talks to someone, goes there & talks to someone, and on & on & on. 5% of the book was about the more interesting parnormal storyline but there very little interaction with other non humans & she was left in the dark about most things relating to what she was."
5,Just listen,"Listen once and you'll want to listen again. Listen twice and you won't be able to get it out of your head. The first 5 cuts really pull you in. ""Orion"" has a very polished feel and like all the songs on this albums some great instrumental talent. ""Reggae Zone"" is way cool with the guitar rift and gives you the feel of being in the hottest nightclub around. These are four very talented musicians and writers. The whole album is very original. It's hard to compare to other artists but if you like the likes of Bonnie Raitt, you'll love the Moon Gypsies. Sometimes feel like they may have been influenced by Bob Seger in the rock & roll area. Male and female lead vocals give you a lot of variety and a lot of range for one album. I've heard them live and what a treat. They sound so good live I had to buy this album and the newest one ""Slip"". They both are worth it. Find their website moongypsies.com and listen or catch them live."
4,A wonderful gift book!,"Janae Bower, author of The Little Girl Who Found IT has written an inspirational gift book that little girls and grown women alike will read, reread and cherish. The simple story of finding the deeper meaning, joy and purpose of life is both heartwarming and thought provoking.The message is a compelling reminder that we all have, within us, the IT. And if we misplace it, or even lose it, we can find IT again. The message will help us live our lives the way we ought to be living them; full and richly.Armchair Interviews says: Read and learn what IT is and the magic of being true to yourself and living life to the fullest."
2,very firm,The contour shape was just what I was looking for but the pillow was VERY firm. I would recommend buying another brand.
2,Don't waste your money,"If you want a broken CD player in 3 months, buy this product. The sound is fine, but it's not durable or dependable at all. Spend your money on a better brand."
3,"Burner's OK, forget the software","The burner works all right. Some have problems with it just spinning & not recording. This is mostly because they're using old software that doesn't recognize the drive. If you use Nero, you must upgrade to 6 or it won't recognize it. Also you have to make sure you have USB 2.0. The Iomega software is EXTREMELY limited. E.g. it won't create video CDs. Even my Paint Shop Photo Album software will produce video CDs."
4,Good burner for Mac OSX,"I bought a refurbished one for 50 bucks from besteksolutions and run it on Mac OSX with the included discribe software and it works perfect. Install took 2 minutes. Although it took about 25 mins to burn an 80 min CD it works perfect. I would recommend to anyone with a Mac, I don't know why everyone else seems to have problems."
1,Is there a score lower than zero?,"I had nothing but problems with this drive. Every time I pluged it in, my windows 98se would lock up within 3 minutes. I tried it on two different computers and got the same result. I wasted a week of evenings downloading patches, updates, etc. The troubleshooting was not very helpful and the Iomega websight was slower than molasses in december. So after a stress-filled week I exchanged it for a TDK brand cdrw. I was burning disks in like five minutes. Maybe it was just my computer (both of them?) but I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a trouble free drive."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this to replace an older Zip 650 that went bad. I was hesitant to buy another Iomega but the previous one was easy to set up and worked fine for a year and a half. It was a bad decision. The HotBurn software included is slow and unreliable (this drive doesn't support Toast). Half the time the disc just spins or if it does burn ends up unreadable. I managed to burn one cd successfully, an audio cd with just 4 tracks. It took 3 times as long as my old drive using Toast.Skip this drive and look elsewhere."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"This sweater is well made, soft, fits true to size, and is easy care. It fits under jackets or is great alone with a scarf or a great necklace."
2,"An ""okay"" book but it has numerous errors","The pace is very slow for the really basic stuff while more sophisticated techniques, such as correlated sub-queries, are not explained well enough.There are numerous errors in the book which suggest the authors don't really know Microsoft Access. Clearly, some of the worked problems were only tried on paper and not through Access itself. Significant errors appear in the discussion of data types (pp. 58 - 81), joins (p. 105), calculations with dates (p. 145), null constraints (p. 282) and referential integrity (p. 288). The downloadable example database does not comply with modern database design protocols.For a much better book, try ""SQL Queries for Mere Mortals"" by Hernandez & Viescas."
5,Best of Kaleo O Kalani,This is an album that is not always easy to get. It is absolutely one of the best Hawai'ian albums there is - very local-style. I love it and it takes me back to my Island home every time I listen. Received in timely manner and good condition. This one is VERY special. Aloha.
3,It is not what you expect!,"This is a pretty melamine cereal bowl (not ceramic, not microwave safe), and it is smaller than suggested. It works better as a cereal or cold desserts bowl."
2,Not worth the money,"As with most people, I bought these bowls to match my kitchen set. I have had the same issues as others. These bowls seem to crack and discolor very easily. They also don't stack very well with the rounded bottom. The stack is always falling over. I don't recommend anyone buy these. I found the older Naturewood Melamine bowls are close enough to suit my need and with the square bottoms I can stack 10 or more securely together in very little space. I wish I could buy more of the Naturewood but I don't think they sell them anymore."
5,JOAN'S REVIEW,I'VE PARTIALLY READ THE BOOK ...POWER SURGE:6 MARKS OF DISCIPLESHIP FOR A CHANGING CHURCH....WHAT A POWERFUL BOOK IT KEEPS YOU THINKING AS YOU READ IT....THANK YOU M FOSS FOR SUCH AN INSPIRATIONAL PIECE OF READING
5,Hope for churches in the future,Great book with concrete suggestions for turning church members into disciples. Definitely worth owning as a pastor or lay person.
3,A worthwhile book for fans of the series.,"Choosing Names is a collection of stories covering the early days of the first Man-Kzin War. The stories mainly focus on humans learning to overcome their pacifism. Kzin telepaths are major figures in all but one story. This focus gives the collection a consistent tone, but doesn't provide that much variety. All of the stories are good but none of them match some of the best stories from earlier in the series."
5,Another Great Niven Book,"The latest book in the Man-Kzin War series Choosing Names: Man-Kzin 8 is a great book. This book is a collection of short stories, showing th difficult, and intriging life of a Kzinti Telepath. The book also involves humans trying to escape from the Kzin and how they deal with the Telepaths. I found this novel to be exciting, full of neat info on the early days of the first Man-Kzin war and the life of Kzin Telepaths. I also found that I couldn't put the book down, I had to keep reading it to see what happened to the characters next."
4,one of the oddest books from Niven to date,"The craftmanship NIven's readers are used to will notice a certain swolleness after reading this eighth installament of the NM Wars saga> Always in search of concrete stories, Niven will satisfy his loyal followers but I couldn't help feeling some of the old creativity missing."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this full of excitement, being a die-hard comedy fan. Don't expect rare footage- this is all taken from a 70's(?) television show.The humor is toned-down, cliche, and predictable. It's cool to see some famous people of today back when they weren't household names, but they are not outrageous or hysterical or even very original. Dry material for a dry audience. Not enough laughs per hour. If you can find it for $5 I would recommend it."
5,Norm Crosby hits a home run.,"I've reviewed most of the popular comedy DVDs, but the World's Greatest Stand Up Comedy Collection stands out. It seems like every comic who I respect is on it, from Jay Leno and Garry Shandling, to legends like Milton Berle (in top form here) and Henny Youngman. I always loved Norm Crosby, but seeing how he put together all these comedy giants really impressed me. He's got to be the most underrated of all the great stand-ups. The way he ties all the various acts together, it's fair to say he's also one of the great hosts in TV history.I can't imagine any comedy fan not falling in love with this. I really got a kick out of watching the young Michael Keaton (I never knew he even did stand-up!) and Nathan Lane. Clocking in at 12 hours, there's enough great material here to keep you laughing for weeks. It seems that the distributor of these discs, Big Vision Entertainment, really came up with a gold mine of material. Highly recommended."
2,Like watching a train wreck,"My wife and I watched it, but a lot of the material was really bad. Very corny jokes, so bad they hurt in some cases. Definitely a lot of material for the money though compared to other stand up DVD's. There are enough funny skits to warrant the purchase I guess, but you have to filter through a lot of bad jokes to find them."
3,Great? Yes. Greatest? No.,"As you have no doubt read in other reviews, this is a 5 DVD set of a syndicated series from the 70's called ""Norm Crosby's Comedy Shop."" The up and coming comics who are today's headliners are amazing to watch in these early years. However, the box mentions the big names from that era such as Buddy Hackett and Don Rickles. BEWARE- MOST OF THE BIG NAMES ADVERTISED ON THE BOX ONLY INTRODUCE THE HOST- NORM CROSBY (or worse, they announce the upcoming commercial break.) They were all good friends of Norms and clearly wanted to help his show, but they don't do any routines. That said, these were half hour shows PACKED with one comic after another- The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (Comedy ain't pretty someone once said.) Best of all, the menu allows you direct access to each comic! Well worth the money, I'm just confused why it's packaged this way................."
5,Touching!,"I can practically visualize 'Nandlala'in the song, 'Nand bhavan khelat Nandlala..'the singer sings all the songs with so much devotion that one is carried away with the mood of the songs."
1,Title says it all,"This is truly an album of gospel music. I don't think it is a very good gospel album.This is not really the Marshall Tucker Band. This is Doug Gray's band. Gray was the original vocalist for the Marshall Tucker Band. But that band disbanded in 1983. The leader of that band, Toy Caldwell, died in 1993. Doug Gray's Marshall Tucker Band does not sound anything like the original.In 1988, Gray and Jerry Eubanks (sax and flute)created a new band, using session musicians and called it the Marshall Tucker Band. They did not sound like the old Marshall Tucker, except when playing the old songs in concert. The band was originally more focused on tradional country music. I haven't heard anything I like by the band.Eubanks has left the band, and the sax and flute on this album is played by someone who came from Firefall."
5,You Will Love Gospel!,"It will be very hard to find a better gospel album than this one. The Tucker boys do an excellent job here; it is too bad it wasn't given much attention upon its release. It includes traditional southern gospel greats such as ""Heart and Soul,"" and ""Eye Is on the Sparrow,"" as well as the songs written by band members such as ""Momma Don't Cry,"" and ""Beauty of Life."" Other highlights include the classic Tucker sounding ""Wayfaring Stranger,"" with the great flute playing, and the jazzy ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken."" Any gospel or Tucker fan will cherish this album as much as I do."
2,"not the real quickstep, disappointed.","the instruction is very detailed which is very commendable. however, it is limited to only three variations and the most important steps which are the kicks and the jumps are not included in this video. very disappointing."
4,Make STRESS REDUCTION a priority,"Dr. Tilden's ""Toxemia Explained"" is a very good book. It is very informative, but is also very technical, which makes reading very difficult at times. However, the content is excellent and makes reading it well worth the effort.This book has been a great help to me personally with my fibromyalgia condition. This book has helped me like no other. Anyone concerned with the ill effects of stress and how to deal with them should read this book."
3,don't buy it!,"hey, yah, i just recieved mine in the mail, i haven't had a chance to finish it yet... but i would just like everyone to know that it is available on the internet for FREE..."
1,PANASONIC RIP-OFF!,"Please be advised that the Panasonic DMW-AC5 AC Adapter for Panasonic Lumix Digital Cameras (or any other compatible a/c adapter) will not connect to your camera.......unless you also buy the propeietary Panasonic converter to go with it; MSRP 49.95. You can't avoid buying the cinverter as long as you want to use your camera's full capabilities. If you plan on keeping your camera, make certain that you can obtain the converter FIRST! Then decide whether you really want to pay the absorbently high price for this ac adater. Personally, I chose a compatible adapter that cost me 18.43, plus 3.95 USPS Shipping. This product definitely does not offer good value for the money."
1,It won't fit into my ZS3 camera. Period!,It won't fit into my ZS3 camera. Period!I don't understand why this item have never removed from Amazon.com.Or it should exclude ZS3 in its list!
5,A must-have for just about anyone,"I have always loved African music, so of course when I saw this album, I just had to buy it. It covers a broad range of styles from soul, jazz, mbaqanga, reggae, jive and of course the wonderful a capella style of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. And like the other Putumayo releases, this one is also handsomely packaged with an informative booklet featuring photos and information about each performer. This is an album that everyone should hear, every song is a treat and leaves you wishing that there were more than 10 songs on it. Highly recommended."
5,I love this collection!,"Just adding my enthusiastic endorsement of this CD for anyone who's a world music fan. I found it much more interesting and enjoyable than several of the other Putomayo African collections (with the exception of ""African Groove, which is phenomenal). The selection of songs is very diverse, and all are first-rate. I especially love the song by Johnny Clegg & Juluka, and am now a great fan of their music. The Miriam Mekeba song is heartbreaking and powerful, even if one doesn't understand the lyrics. Overall, the collection is spiritual and upbeat, and puts me in a joyful mood. A wonderful collection of songs from a very beautiful part of the world!"
3,"A good overview, but not the most stirring material","Definitely a good overview for someone trying to get a feel for the variety of material available from South Africa. A CD that I enjoyed checking out from the library and hearing once, but definitely not something for any serious collection. Dig deeper to understand and explore more about your favorites among these and other tremendous African musical artists."
2,Bad quality,The text size and format is fine but the cover easily rips. I had a tear in one week. New tears are showing and we don't handle the Bible roughly at all.
5,leather Bible,"I ordered this Bible because of the translation and that it has a leather cover. The seller rated it as being in good condition. It was better than that - it was still sealed in plastic in its original box. And it was a bargain to boot - I got it for $13 and the price, still on the box, was $45, which is consistent with prices I've seen in bookstores. I would buy from this seller again."
1,At least the inside is good...,"The bible is the bible. Enough said, however the outside, the part most people see is lacking. One of the ugliest outside covers I've ever seen for a ""Genuine Leather"" binding. I was very disappointed. Too bad I already wrote my name in it, I could re-gift it!"
4,Little B.G.,B.G. actually did this album when he was 11 years old back in 1993.He kind sounds the same today.Lyrically this album is point.This album will not be rated the usual way but if your a fan of the B.G you should buy
5,GET YO SHINE ON,B.G. THIS CD IS TIGHT. EVERY SONG IS REAL AND THE BEATS BY MANNIE FRESH ARE HOT!!!! PICK THIS CD UP!!! NOW!!!!
5,This Is A Tight Cd,This Is Such A Great Cd If you Dont Own This Album You Have You Put In in your cart And Greatly Anticipate its arivle its got a tight cover 7 even though it only has 8 songs its the best 8 songs ever. buy this cd now!! Because Cash Money Is A Army
5,Bought for Eggspert buzzer game. It works perfectly,"I bought this adapter to power the ""Eggspert"" light up buzzer game. It fits and works just as it should. I like the Eggspert buzzer and with this adapter I do not need to keep buying batteries for it. I'm sure other adapters would work too, but I chose this one."
1,Wrong adapter for time tracker,This adapter DOES NOT work with the time tracker. I removed the batteries before trying the adapter and the unit seemed to be getting some power but none of the functions worked correctly.
4,"its an adapter, not a 'toy'","its not ""fun"" or ""educational"" - its an adapter to something else... BUT as an adapter it works great. I dont understand why it is so expensive and wish I could have found one cheaper- but I just ordered them together so they would arrive together... It is working great to power its intended item."
4,Learning by listening,"The cassettes are good listening and of good quality. I felt that I really did learn quickly, but there are a couple of provisos. I had wanted to learn with my ears, but found that the tapes EXPECT the listener to also have a textbook, which I never found! I did buy the second set in this series, and at that point the lack of the textbook (NO text materials were provided with the tapes) became more extreme. Also, there are only listen/respond components to these tapes, so you don't learn to HEAR the language. You can talk, you just won't understand the response!"
3,not white,"does not look like the posted picture at all it's actually a purpley gray color, so i felt a little bit ripped off. it's a 12.5 loft 460cc. but i kept it and it works great"
4,I'm impressed !,"When I was in the market for another guitar I looked at most all of the larger ""name"" instruments. I've been using a 64' Gibson J-45 and was looking for a guitar that would have comparable tone but in an electric/accoustic. Well, I was put onto the Breedlove AC25SR/Plus and was really impressed with the depth, tone and playability of this mid-priced guitar. It's rapidily becoming one of my favorites. I find it a bit on the ""heavy"" side, weightwise, but that's about my only negative. Are there better guitars? Sure, but I really don't believe you can go wrong for the price that produces this kind of sound. I've enjoyed mine immensely."
1,trade in ure mic and git a kilo quick!,"I never write reviews, but for this trash something had to be said.This is the worst album that i heard in a long time. First off it has the dumbest intro in history, the beats are the only positive thing, and they arent that good. Save ure money and ure hard drive do downlaod this. hopefully this is his last album."
3,"DON'T HATE, HE'S FEATURED ON THE SOURCE","GOOD ALBUM.....THE DVD IS TRASH! I REPEAT, IT COMES WITH A 5-10 MINUTE DVD WHICH IS WORTH NOTHING. ONLY 5 SEC CLIPS OF HIS VIDEOS.HOWEVER!!!!!!!!YOU SHOULD GET THIS CD BECAUSE MARV IS A RAW AND ROUGH STYLE RAPPER....SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T GET LISTENING TO WESTCOAST ARTSISTS LIKE E-40, SNOOP DOGG, ETC. EITHER THEY TOO SMOOTH OR THEIR VOICE IS TOO POETIC LIKE 'PAC. I WOULD DESCRIBE MARV'S STYLE AS A COMBINATION OF EAST/SOUTH FLAVOR (LYRICAL/DIRTY)MY FAVORITE SONGS: 1.BABY!!!!!!! 100/10 (VERY MELODIC, HUMOROUS BUT ALSO TRUE)2.OH NO 8/10 (GREAT NATE DOGG HOOKS)"

4,National Mfg N183723 Keyed Window Sash Lock,"Not much to say about a lock.Seems to be well built, installs easily and the key works. I installed about 5 of these on first floor windows."
2,Uninteresting but educational,I think I was expecting too much after reading Left Behind the Kids Series. I would have enjoyed this book more if it had been written in a narrative chronological manner. I also didn't like having to stop my reading to look up the sciptures when the author could have included them in his narrative.
2,A reader from UK,"I dont quite understand what all the fuss is over this author Stanek. His books are positively lacking any in depth understanding. I am only making this criticism as I have a collection of 30 internet related books. His books appeal to more 'readers' than 'doers' ie. people who think that by reading they have learnt the material. However for serious users and developers beware! It is clear that this book is written by operating the features found in the package and then writing about it rather than doing anything useful with it. Every time I hit across a problem and reference the book, I only find superficial information."
2,Good..ish book for beginners,This Book is great for those people that have the time and the inclination to wade through 1000 pages and put up with the inconsistent errors that appear in the book.Why can't people write accurate short books on these subjects ?
4,Great book for beginners who know the basics of HTML !,"A very good introduction into FP 98 with all it's aspects. What really is missing for advanced users and web builders are chapters for costumizing FP (images in FP navigation bars, search engine, SSL...)."
2,Not the best or the easiest for Frontpage,"I purchased this book after reading the reviews on this page but thankfully my bookstore let me exchange it. I found it hard to follow and the writing is not very clear or good in places. I swapped it for The Complete Idiot's Guide To Frontpage and I must say that (to me) it is a more practical and easier to understand book. The experts may recommend Stanek, but for the novice, I'd tell you to stay away from this one."
5,THE definitive FrontPage book!,FrontPage 98 Unleashed is recommended reading from Amazon and Microsoft help desk! It has everything you need to go to the extreme with FrontPage 98. This was one of the rare books that I actually enjoyed reading. I learned so much from this one book is has paid for itself many times over.I ordered extra copies to use in in-house training. I don't see how you can get by without it. Buy it! You won't regret the decision.
5,Incredibly detailed and comprehensive,I spent an hour in the bookstore! I tried to find the best FrontPage book and this was it. The author doesn't miss a beat. This covers everything. I really enjoy using it which is something I can't say aobut most other computer books. This webmistress will definitely be buying more books by this author...Thanks Amazon for selling this at a great discount!
5,Stanek's BEST book to date!,1 of 6 STANEK books I've purchased. This is the BEST book so far. It is all in the details. Stanek understands what makes a great computer book. Well done! Provides everything you need to learn FrontPage 98. I love it...
4,The Submarine Pitch,"The Submarine Pitch By Matt ChristopherHave you ever found something that seemedlike nothing, but was something very important?Well, that's what happens in The Submarine Pitchby Matt Christopher. I recommend this bookbecause there's always something to keep you fromputting down the book. I learned that you shouldnever say someone can't do something unless youhave seen he can't do it."
3,not bad,for the money you get what you expect...i used them as a bumming around flip-flop but if your wanting something comfortable this is not what you want.
2,Not sleazy enough...,"Hard-ass new fish in big house WIP, directed by Tom DeSimone,who made ""Prison Girls"" and ""Reform School Grils"" starts OK, butfor some reason there is hardly any T&A; in this movie!Barbara Luna is notable as QueenB, but this is not the stronestof the 80s WIPs. Region 2 dvd is available from amazon.uk."
4,I'm sure these are wonderful.,"I finally got these in today and was so happy. Then I find out do they not come with any of the cables required to hook them up, they also require external amplification, neither of these facts appear to be listed anywhere in the product description. I lost my job two days after ordering these. I cant buy what I need to use them. Think I might commit suicide. Seems like a good plan. Thanks alesis! you have a death on your hands."
5,"I love them! I'm no pro, but these are great.","These are the best speakers I've ever owned. As I said, I'm no pro. I'm using them as computer speaker, studio monitors, and general music playing, and they sound FANTASTIC!! I was town between these and the behringers ms40's, and so far I'm glad I picked these.Pros: Crisp clean base, as well as a great mid and high. They look very nice IMO. They are small enough to fit almost anywhere. They are magneticly shielded. And all in all, they are heavy, and seem well built. I've owned yamaha's, sony's, jbl's, and these sound by far the best. Even my girlfriend likes the way they sound. LolThe only CON: No grille covers. It would be nice, but definitely not a deal breaker.Bottom line: Unless you need the $1000.00 a piece monitors, these should be perfect.YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED. :)"
1,I take back my other review,I wrote a review saying it was good. But it really isnt good. I take it back. Mine broke already. And it says it doesnt skip. Well you have to hold it still till a bar goes all the way up then you can start shaking it but not untill all of them are up. Also when you start they CD player it has static every once in a while. It isnt loud either. and the batteries wear out quick. I do not recommend this item to anyone
3,Shipment was swnt on the last possible date,This book is a very good book. I ordered this one and another containing many practice tests for my son. I highly recommend this book since it actually shows you how to obtain the answer with a very detailed explanation. My only complaint is with the company that shipped it. The order was promised from Oct 15 to the 30th. With the tests on the 7th of november I took the risks and ordered the book. Well it arrived Oct 30 with only a week left to the test. It was my fault in trusting the company would not wait till the last minute to ship the item. And of course it did. Either the way the pros are the book was in great shape and was much more helpful than the more expensive Barrons SSHSAT practice book I bought.
5,Quest for the Pillars of Wealth,"This book is definately good! Not only does it have a good message but a good story line. Everything was described vividly,and you could relate to the characters. It was almost like Harry Potter, but it shows you how to grow rich.If you follow what the story says,have the desire for money ,save ,and invest, you are on the road to success! I recommend it to anyone,it could teach everyone,a thing or two! I applaud Mr.Pritchard for his job well done!"
2,not satisfied,returned and received full refund and shipping.listed as being yellow and was silver.not dual power as i understood.sent it back.
3,video quality not what it should be.,"I chose 3 stars, not because this wasn't a great movie, but because of the DVD video quality, not nearly what I thought it should be. I still have many non Blu ray movies that up- convert nicely with my BD player, this one did not, it was like watching a VHS movie."
4,Not a great western but I liked the story,A good story but I don't think it's a great western movie. James Caan does a good job as a western actor. Jane Fonda is pretty tough in this story and I don't think I have seen her in a role like this one. She is very believable in this characterization of a tough western woman rancher.
3,"Good film, poor editing.","I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. Great scenery. Good story, not well told. Choppy editing. Film climax is a bit of a letdown. One interesting thing, the film came out about the same time that the Dallas TV show started. Bad guy is Ewing. Jim Davis, of Dallas fame, is in the film. I wonder if the Ewing name in Dallas TV show was picked up from this film."
1,Size very inconsistent,"I bought this costume for my my son (size 8) in a large (size 10-12) thinking I would have to take it in. The pants are 3 inches too short, the shirt is too big, and the hat would be more appropriate for a toddler. He can't fit it on his head. I would NOT recommend this product because of the inconsistent sizing. A waste of money!"
4,Lasted 2 years so far,Great little costume. Washes well and fits well. It has been durable. The reason that I gave it a 4 star rating was because the hat was useless. Way to small for my four year old sons head. (The outfit was purchsed for the 6 year old - no chance on the hat!) We are average sized people. None of us have double-yoker heads but it just wouldn't fit at all!
1,Does not fit 06 ford expedition,"Just FYI the ""make sure it fits you vehicle box"" said it would fit a 2006 Ford Expedition XLT, however it does not. The mounting plates on the hitch are about 4 inches wider than the frame of the SUV."
3,Kenpo patch,there is the letter n missing in Okinawan and the lettering is not evenly spaced...I like the coloring of the patch and with a loittle tlc..I can make it work.
1,Not much good comes from this ego trip,"Outside of the following. Sykes, in spite of his egomania, conveys the important fact that the all important and numerous British have a good deal of mitochondrial DNA of the Syrian kind. This explains why, say, Charlton Heston (Britsh) looks like Ralph Nader (Syrian). As a British person myself (now residing in the USA) I find it interesting that I have so much arab blood from 10,000 years ago. Everything else in the book is worthless. Basques and Polynesians are too few in number the world over so explaining their origins was a total waste (besides what was an explanation of polynesian dna doing in this book anyway, they aren't even Europeans). Also, we already knew (from Paabo!) that Neanderthals aren't in our dna (at least not very much). And the whole stone age historical fiction concept is really dumb and totally fake. An overall rotten book."
1,Totally awful book!,Sykes is an egomaniac all the way. Nothing more I can add about that that hasn't been written.
1,Absolutely painful to read is this book!,"Either this stuck up English twit Sykes is writing all about himself or he's writing stupid, phony stone age stories. If I want dumb stone age fiction I'll watch The Flintstones."
1,Book is full of unnecessary bits and dumb bits,"1)The bit about his love of hamsters as a kid was both unnecessary and dumb2)The fictional stories bit (last half of the book) was both dumb and unnecessary but mostly just dumb3) The bit on Anastasia was unnecessary4) The bit on the neanderthals was unnecessary (it's been pointed out, we already knew they weren't in our background, at least not much)5)The gripes with the other scientists was unnecessary6)The Polynesian DNA bit was unnecessary (and totally out of place)I could go on but I've made my point. Book is a total bummer."
3,There are better books about the subject,"I am interested about haplogroups and do not regret buying the book. However, I do not consider the book particularly good.First half of the book was at least interesting reading (more about history of DNA science than those Seven Daughters).Second half was quite different. I do not mind at all including the fictional stories about these ""seven daughters"" in the book - these stories were just not very interesting! And they appear to represent some ""peaceful past"" mythology where in distant past no human-to-humal violence exist, females had much more rights than their sisters in 21th century in most of world and only violent event could be attack of some carnivorous predator like leopard.(I am surprised that Ursula was allowed to get pregnant at the age of 15, how come these nice and admirable law abinding citizens of 40000 BC were not heard that UK age of consent is 16)"
3,Interesting but flawed,"The book gave some interesting ideas but the authro should try to refrain himself from writing his own personal ""feuds"" with other researchers.It is a fast reading book. Thought-provoking."
2,Shameless self promotion,"Not only did Bryan Sykes skew the history of using genetic markers to answer historical questions, he danced on the edge of irresponsible science. The problems I have with this book are the following:1)He makes it sound as if he was the major researcher studying human genetic origins. [He was one of many]2)His use of donated samples is shameful (looking up names in the database), and gives genetic researchers a bad name.3)His fictionalized daughters of Eve is confusing for the more gullible reader, and just plain silly for the more astute.4)His shameless promotion of his company is in very poor taste. I would be careful about sending in my DNA sample. He will probably sell his surname/genotype database to the highest bidder.The field as a whole is very exciting and important for historians, anthropologists, forensic scientists and family researchers. It is too bad that this book will be the main way that the general public can learn about the field."
4,From whom do we originate?,"I thought this was a really neat book. This book is about the geneology of humankind. There is little doubt in my mind that genetics will prove to be the definitive tool for all sorts of mysteries. Archeology will never be the same as a result of these inroads by genetics. Dr. Sykes' detective sleuthing of the Polynesian migration led nicely into the more challenging task of Europe and eventually the world. It is very humbling, although not surprising, to know that the billions of people alive today are all relatives. The majority of the work is devoted to the ancestry of Europeans showing that over 80% of them are derived from a mere seven women. These types of studies will become a necessary tool in the reconstruction of history and will allow a better confidence level in the results. This book is easy to read and enjoyable besides."
4,Informative & Insightful,The author does an excellent job of giving the timeline of his research and facts to back up his theory. Might be a hard read for people who are not into the very technical side of his research. Only down side would be his stories of the seven women which are a bit sentimental. Otherwise I highly recommend this book.
3,"Science yes, anthropology no","For an interested layperson, Mr Sykes has clearly laid out the scientific bases of his work, and makes a gripping detective story out of what could have sounded like another high school biology text.The only disappointment for this reader came in the second section, in which Mr Sykes visualizes the lives of his seven clan mothers. He may have spent too much time in the lab and battling for his new ideas to have consulted with current research into the lives of hunter-gatherers. As this will be a book of interest to many, it is a shame that it relies on now-discredited myths of our prehistoric ancestors: the old museum dioramas with the females huddling in caves while their mates bring home the wooly mammoth. To see what these seven women might have been up to, I'd consult the anthropologist/novelist Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, or Hrdy's ""Mother Nature."""
5,Awesome!,"Such a great book to read! Combines some history, science, and fantasy. I have learned a lot. Great book to spark discussions. Really has changed some of my views - re-educated me and in many ways arguing against what most of us were taught in school as far as the evolution of human kind. If your European, its cool because he spends a lot of time looking at European ancestry."
4,Lucid book on human evolution and history,"But for the Clan of the Cave Bear-esque chapters on the seven progenitors themselves, this is a very lucid science book explaining mitochondrial DNA and some of the uses to which it's been put as a means of understanding human evolution and history. The seven daughters are actually more like the seven mothers -- the seven women back to whom almost all modern Europeans can trace their lineage. Having read Nicholas Wade, with his explanation of how it is that most Icelanders trace their DNA back to a very few people even only a few centuries ago, I could believe this theory pretty readily. It's sort of amazing how many lines die out."
1,"Book gives new meaning to the word ""unnecessary""!!!!",The other reviewer who pointed out the unnecessary bits (some of which were also dumb) was right on the money.
1,save your money,"the book is poorly written, contains little new information, and seems more like a long advertisement for the author's company than anything else. His final chapters on each of the 'seven daughters' is misleading and will seem silly to even a layperson with some knowledge of recent discoveries in human genetics"
4,Enjoyed it,Eye opening! Great intro to the world of genetics. I certainly want to know more. Which clan am I from???
4,We're blood brothers (or is it sisters?),"This is an easy read about a fantastic development in genetics research that allows us to trace maternal lineages back to prehistoric times. For me, the attempt to create a dramatic characterization of the founding individuals is a little hokie, but the concept is stunning. Most of the book is devoted to an account of the development of the technique (analysis of mitochondrial DNA to construct maternal lineages) and provides an interesting narrative that will not be too technical for most readers. Alas, one of the big conclusions of the research is that modern Europeans are not decendants of Neanderthals. Oh well, I still know a few individuals who may have slipped under the radar ;)."
4,"So, from which daughter of Eve am I decended from?","I loved this book. I have always been interested in man's origins. This book traces persons of European decent to 7 women. Even for someone such as myself that has only a passing knowledge of genetics this was an easy informative read. This book was written for a broad audience. This is a great easy read for anyone who has an interest in evolution, genetics, or human history."
5,Which of the Seven Daughters is Your Ancestor?,Wow a well written book that tells about the origins of Nearly every White European on the planet. Who were these seven daughters?They were women who had a mutated gene that gave their offspring and advantage. Each of the seven daughters is simply the first after the appearance of their mutation to have a daughter who had a daughter who had a daughter and so forth in an unbroken line of female descent right up to the present day.
3,"Interesting stuff, but can be boring at times.","I thought this book was interesting how they found the genetic information on our ancestors. I like how he explained his story on the seven daughters and how DNA is passed on from the parents to the child. There were some points in the story where it got boring for me because I am not a big scientist or anthrologist fan, but I'm into family history and I thought this book will help me understand better how DNA was discovered through this book. I can say I learned a lot and it opened a new world of knowledge for me to understand our lives."
5,The Seven Daughters of Eve,This book is one of the most interesting that I have read in a long time.Well written and easy to understand.I will be purchasing more books written by the author.Mirella Uicich
4,a good read,"This book by Bryan Sykes was a fasciating read for me, learning about DNA testing and what we have found out since we have been able to work with it.The thesis of the book is that everyone living today has come from one of seven (7) females in the long past. How he gets us there and by what proof is in the book.This is a fascinating read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
1,Some good info but self-serving and unreferenced,"Sykes has done good work in the fast-moving field of historical genetics. However, The Seven Daughters of Eve is terribly self-serving, lacks references, gives too little credit to other workers, and is unbalanced.Better choices or to purge yourself from Sykes' work, I suggest you read 'Mapping Human History' by Steve Olson or 'Genes Languages and People' by Luca Cavalli-Sforza. Both give a balanced view of the field, are deeply referenced, and are easy reads.Sykes' mitochondrial DNA approach was not always honored or perhaps even fairly received; Sykes is probably correct in feeling himself unfairly treated. However, there is too much ""get back"" in this book. It is, however, a fast read and gives some good background in validating mtDNA as a reliable science."
3,interesting but a bit scatter shot execution,"Sykes brings together an interesting new way of examining our genetic heritage, especially from an European perspective. He sheds light on a study of genetics that I was not familiar with. The problem is that Sykes can't stay in a good scientific examination. Much of the book seems self promoting, and while he is a pioneer in much of this, it seemed that he built his credentials more on the media than on his academics. He brings his research to an interesting conclusion tracking genes back to seven original ""mothers"" in Europe. But then he tries to tell us the stories of these seven women, and things just fall apart. It is an abrupt shift from this scientific quest to the creation of fictional stories of the lives of these women. He could have served his cause better if he had stuck to fact instead of writing narrative conjecture.Still, an interesting book and a fascinating look into one slice of the science of genetics."
2,Sykes tells us more about his life than the subject matter,"Well, I'm not sure why my previous review wasn't helpful unless people are responding to my negative rating alone. So, here's a shorter, revamped review. The author doesn't check his facts. As I was reading the book, I was embarassed for him. It often seems his main source for information is the Discovery Channel and not enough real research that one should expect from someone of his status. I've done further research on the matter and found that the author in the book isn't entirely honest about ""his"" own accomplishments as well. The book does have some good information, but he spends too much of the print puffing up his own ego, and not enough supporting his arguements.My recommendation is AVOID. Wait for another book on the topic."
5,The Seven Daughters of Eve,"This book was loaned to me by a friend. I found it very interesting; in fact it is fascinating, so I had to buy it for my sister. Not only is the system of DNA mapping explained but there is a narrative about the entire process of finding these matriarchs. In a fictional depiction of the seven daughters' lives the author paints vivid pictures of the various pre-history periods and locations involved. I would recommend this book to all the curious and to those interested in geneology."
4,A useful read.,This is a good book for the layperson. Reads like a novel. I hope this does not cause people to think that it is not a serious book.
5,Thought provoking,This book is amazing....it is very thought provoking. I came away wanting to know where I came from...I thought I knew...what do I really know about my ancestry?
3,Season One is ok,Season Two is much better. It took awhile for shipping even though it was expedited.
2,AAAARGH~!,"Whatever informative or educational value this program could have had is utterly demolished by the disgusting over-use of one sound effect; a generic one used billions of times before in video games, TV, and movies, of a male voice going ""AAAARGH!"" which is played as much as possible, as often as possible, over and over and over and over and over and over again.For reference, the sound effect sounds a lot like Charlie Brown going ""AAAGH!"" with his head straight up so his mouth opens up massively.In between scene shifts, from showing pictures to showing interviews to showing footage to showing ANYTHING, this aggravating sound effect is played, to a point where the series becomes simply unwatchable. It is unwatchable. And all because of one stupid sound effect played several dozen times per episode."
2,"Garbage unwatchable, more funny than dramatic","I am a huge fan of any reality shows about criminals or crime, I was so disappointed with this show, I feel like the producers just wanted to make a full season any way they can.Most of the episodes are a pure joke, these so called gangs are nothing more than a bunch of teen high school drop outs waving gang signs and driving around in $200 dollar cars but the producers somehow thought they should dedicate a full episode to those losers.Most of the characters are a joke, I couldn't stop from laughing when I was watching some of these clowns lecturing there ideals infront of the camera, truly the highest moment in there lives.I'd say maybe 2 or 3 episodes are watchable , the American gangster and the Arian brotherhood thats about it, the rest are just pure garbage, I recommend MSNBC Lock Up."
1,Idiots at Amazon,"The wrong description is on the damn video, thanks for stealing my money.In the future a little quality control will avoid the bad mouthing campaign I am about to embark upon on your behalf morons!"
5,Very informative. This is one of my all time favorite documentary series.,"This show is very eye opening, and surreal. I had no idea that there were so many gangs upon us. Gangs are literally everywhere. This series gives an indepth look at each gangs structure, rules, colors, inner workings, rivals, how and why they commit crimes, and why they don't give a damn what anyone thinks. Each gang has their own agenda. This series gives a close up look on the underground world that most people don't know about, or don't pay attention to. Gangs like the skin heads, MS-13, Hell's Angels, and the Mexican Mafia are clearly threats to every single one of us. Everybody should watch this show to make yourself more familiar on how to spot a gang member. Furthermore, watching this makes a person realize that you should never mess around with these gangs, because the gangs clearly mean business. If you get in the gangs way, they will deal with you in a way that could even be your death."
1,*NOT* about the Hells Angels -,"The poor rating is due to the inaccurate description of the episode. Gangland, season one, episode 13 is advertised as ""The Hells Angels are the most powerful and well-known biker club on the planet, boasting over 2500 members."" In fact, the episode is about MS-13, the Mara Salvatrucha. I'm not the first to have found this out and I'm surprised that Amazon hasn't corrected it yet. However, instead of griping to everyone I know (I'm a huge fan of Amazon), I'm going to contact Customer Service and see if we can get this fixed. Hopefully I can come back shortly and change my review to one praising Amazon's swift response and correction of this minor error."
1,Look instead at Core JavaServer Faces or free J2EE tutorial,"1/4 of the book goes explains how to use JSP, JSTL2/4 of the book API reprint1/4 of the book actual JSF stuff - not real world related - unless you know exactly what you are looking for you'll never find it...i'm surprised this book went into print - probably somebody upstairs decided to have at least something rather than nothing.waste of time and money."
2,some interesting topics covered...,"but overall fails to deliver. I bought this book alongwith Core JSF. The latter turned out to be much better for getting into JSF. This book has some coverage on creating views in code or using html/xml etc, but otherwise it lacks any depth in other topics.One annoying thing is there are no subsections in this book...the only way to tell which section you are in is by deciphering the font SIZE (its the same font, same style)!!"
1,Developers deserve better,I feel being cheated.This book does not adequately address the relevant topics to make it meaningful. It covers only a very few topics and devoted almost half of the book to the online documentation.
3,Pretty good reference for Java Server Faces,"It describes very details about JSP, HTML and web architechure. However, I think it's not necessary as the readers should have basic knowledge of Java.There are many examples to demonstrate how to use JSF. It's good for beginner. It lets reader to get knowledge faster and neatly. However, the codes must be downloaded from Internet. It's not convenience for us.There are some parts for intermediate and expert JSP developers. ""Developing Custom Renders and Components"" are good topics.The Appendix is very useful for developer to get syntax of JSF quickly. I appreciate it."
4,Good,"Good for the skin, & the new bottle makes it easier to use. Would buy again....mildly uplifting & firming, good for aging skin."
3,Wonderful Company,I have yet to try the 'Serum'. When I got my order I got capsules rather than serum. When I notified Olympian they politely agreed to send the order I requested and provide me with a way to return what I haven't opened. Can't wait to try it.
2,"Inaccurate, mostly drawn from previous biographies","Biles claims that Daley held back the 1960 vote to deliver for JFK. Len O'Connor, in his better _Clout_, tell us that Daley delivered the vote early to demoralize West Coast Republicans at the risk of being out-defrauded in IL by Du Page County. Other flaws include claiming that former 43rd Ward Alderman William Singer was elected to the 44th in 1969 and use of contemporary ward maps to illustrate returns for old elections with different ward layouts. Unfortunately, better Daley biographies such as _Clout, and Royko's _Boss_ are out-of-print."
2,Not for everyone,"Bought this product thinking it would be helpful, but it just hasn't been a good fit for me. Seems a bit inauthentic and shallow. I really don't care for her original ""song"" as I found it quite annoying. But that could just be me."
5,Retro Cool,Awesome little retro sign. Looks like one of those old signs you'd see in an old-fashioned gas station back in the day. Looks cool in my garage.
5,Great Buy!,"Quick ship, recieved the item sooner than expected and it was exactly as described. Great purchase, thank you!"
4,"good sign, bad shipping","The sign is as it looks (good), but is very thin tin and just shipped in a padded envelope. It was bent just like other reviewers cited. If you can find the sign in a retailer buy it, but if you get it shipped it will probably come bent so prepare yourself for that."
4,The best of Kalapan since The Best of Kalapana,"Strong tunes that harken back to the bands roots in the mid-70's contemporary scene in Hawaiian music include I Need Your Love, Be There Now and Molokai Sweet Home. Mackey Feary is as good as ever on I Remember You. The bands evolution is also displayed on tunes like Strolling on the Seashore and Me and My Shonanbo (whatever that is!)"
4,scott's review,"Nice travel alarm clock. It's a plastic case, not super small, but small enough, simple to use. Does not always wake up my super-sound sleeping daughter, since it automatically shuts off after a minute (or 30 seconds?). It has two alarm levels, the alarm is a higher frequency that hard of hearing people may not hear, but would generally wake up anyone that wants to get up. I also use it as a back up alarm for when I have to catch a flight, and I don't have to worry about not hearing it, even when I put it 10 feet away from my bed...."
3,"Loud, but does not always go off","It's loud enough to wake up someone who sleeps with earplugs.On occasion the alarm does not go off. I remember one time in particular. Something jolted me awake but the alarm was not beeping. It went off for a split second at the proper time but did not keep beeping. I remember a few other times in which I woke up late but noticed that everything on the alarm was set correctly. Sometimes it does not go off, or only goes off for a split second.To have the back-light not flicker, you have to press on the big button on the top really hard and put pressure on just the right spots.Use it as a back-up alarm."
1,"Cheap, janky alarm clock","This thing only worked twice for me. Today it sits on my computer desk displaying the time only. If you need to make someone late for work, here ya go :("
2,Not as loud as I expected from other reviews.,This clock is louder than your average alarm clock but not nearly as loud as I thought it would be based on the product description and other reviews on Amazon.
4,Big Mouth Alarm Clock,I'm hard of hearing and saw this recommended as a travel alarm. It's easy to use and compact. Alarm is loud enough. I haven't used it enough yet to give it 5 stars.
1,Too expensive if you smoke,"I bought the air filter for my smoking, to clean the air.I figured it would at least last 2 months. But it only lasts for about a month and at $12.00 a piece, it gets expensive to keep replacing the filters.These are smaller, maybe 4X4 filters and I think they are over priced especially since they don't last longer.They should be priced lower but I suppose they were made for non smokers."
1,Another Disappointment - Not Original Filter Quality,"If you are looking for the ""original"" 04712 Allergen Reducing filters, this is not the place to order from. Perhaps they no longer exist. I've tried many local stores and this is my 2nd attempt from an amazon vendor to get the original filters and no luck They are made from and entirely different material and don't appear to work anywhere near as well as the originals. Good luck finding what you need. I give up.This imitation may work ok if you're just trying to cut down on smoke or a little dust but not for people with mite allergies."
1,NOT original 3M filter,"WARNING : Product being delivered is not the one pictured on this page !!Product being delivered is a cheap generic filter, not 3M Filtrete."
5,got allergies get this filter,if you got the Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04381 Allergen Reducer Air Cleaner this filter is a must have.. get as many as you can..
2,"Shiesty, shiesty company","Shame on this company for selling a knock-off filter and not stating so in the product description! And shame on Amazon for letting this happen. I selected this item because it was priced higher than the other knock-offs that were being sold truthfully. Because of the higher price and item description, I thought I was buying a product made by Hamilton Beach. I could have paid a lot less for the same crappy product."
2,"great product, can't afford them anymore","annoying that i bought an air purifier that only uses these filters and now i can't get them anywhere but here and the shipping on them makes it so ridiculous that it's not worth it. they carried them at target when i first got it, but now this is the only place...so now i have to buy a new purifier. sad."
2,not the real thing!,"I was expecting the actual hamilton beach brand since that's the description. Instead, I got a knock off... cheaper quality."
5,more expensive,"I bought 3 of these filters from Amazon for $30.00 but now each fiter has gone up to around $36.00 whih is ridiclous, that is how much the unit itslf cost. The filter itsef works great and last for 3 months, I know if you look around you can get the filters for about $19.99"
5,Filter review,This filter is always full when I change it every 4 months so it's taking things out of the air that we would otherwise be breathing.
5,Does the job!,This filter does work. The proof is in the pudding. When I went to change the filter in my bedroom it was gray! I have one big dog and 2 bengal cats. It helps. I can breathe in my room again.. hooray!
4,Cleans the air,"This filter works really well in that it really does clean the air. After a month or 2 months of using this filter, it is turning gray. You can see that it is capturing the dust in the air. The only drawback is that you have to keep buying and replacing the filter as they get dirtier through the months. This can start adding up. However, after seeing how much dust it collects, it is worth the investment.I do notice a slight smell as another reviewer mentioned, but I do not find the smell to be horrible or sickening. It just has a unique smell that eventually goes away.The filter is easy to install and easy to dispose of."
1,Bait and Switch,"As other reviewers have commented, this seller does not provide the item pictured. I did not get the same Hamilton Beach True Air 3M replacement filter pictured and advertised here, that I had previously purchased in brick-and-mortar stores. Instead I got cheap, generic knock-offs. As per Amazon policy, I first contacted the seller directly asking for a full refund, including my shipping charges, since I would not have ordered this item in the first place if I had known I would not get the item pictured. The seller never responded. I had to go through Amazon and exercise the A-to-Z guarantee to get my refund. I appreciate Amazon's excellent customer service in honoring their guarantee in a timely fashion and in refunding both the product costs and shipping costs. But I am surprised and disappointed that, with all the complaints this seller gets, Amazon allows the seller to still operate through the Amazon website."
1,NOT HB TrueAir 04712 Filter,"As other reviewers have noted, this is not the advertised Hamilton Beach filter, but rather a generic. I'm not sure what the seller has to gain by misrepresenting this product because the game's up as soon as you open the box. As to whether the products functions as well as the HB original I can't say. But I'd certainly think twice about ordering from this company in the future."
1,Not the 3m TrueAir Filter,I was expecting to receive the 04712 3m TrueAir filter but instead received an RPS Products 'BestAir' (HD712). This shouldn't be advertised as the original if you're actually getting a replacement filter.
1,Not a genuine 3M Filtrete filter,"I realize I'm reviewing the company ""Allergy Be Gone"" and not the actual product, but this is to warn people. This company is trying to profit by selling a knock-off of an original product that is in short supply without specifying this in the description. I'm pretty sure this practice is illegal considering the product photo shows the original 3M Filtrete logo. As far as the actual product though, I can tell its quality is inferior to the original 3M filter that came with the unit."
1,Cheap knock off - SCAM,"As other reviewers stated, this is an extremely cheap knock off, low quality, not properly fitting the machine. Sold at the same cost as the original TrueAir filter.They sell the exact same low quality filter for just a couple of Dollars. I expected to receive the same filter I bought 2 years ago and the ITEM WAS NOT AS PICTURED. This is deceit. Shame on you."
4,no more filters,Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04712 Allergen Reducing Filtercan't get any filtrs for this unit so don't buy one! I have even called 3M/filtrete and still not luck on getting a response back as of yet.
5,Way to expensive!,"I am VERY happy with the proformance of this spark plug, however the price was so high that I will not buy another one from Amazon."
4,The book you must read before starting your gourmet store,"You will find in this book the best advices for anybody who wants to endertake a Gourmet food business. From the design of the store (including Kitchen equipment) to the day to day operation, from a theorical business plan to its practical application, Robert Wemischner and Karen Karp provide the reader with the best support and the best methodology to succeed in this business. ""Gourmet to Go"" is a book that leads step by step the Gourmet food entrepreneur to a real and durable success in this field. Most of the subjects are treated with an obvious professional background. We would like to find some more informations on the product by itself (type of food, type of gourmet product) and maybe some ideas on possible future development... This is a very hepfull manual."
2,Outdated!,You can easily find all of the book's information and more by visiting your favorite specialty shop and through the internet. Don't bother.
3,Pretty Good,"Robert Randisi is a good writer.I've enjoyed all his books,and ""Blood on the Arch""is no exception.I read the book in 2 days.Joe Keogh is an interesting character.Short chapters,lots of conversations-what more could you ask for?Ha!"
3,Quirky and difficult to use,"As others here have noted, the reviews in the Good CD Guide are gossipy and tainted by a British bias. They can also be annoyingly repetitive; sometimes every review of a piece will include general comments about the piece, in addition to the review of the recording itself. As a consequence, perhaps, surprisingly few recordings are actually reviewed, despite the size of the book. Also worth noting is that the book is printed on cheap, rough paper, the text is printed too close to the spine, and the book will not lay flat -- all in contrast to the Penguin Guide.If you're seeking an antidote to the Penguin Guide, I would suggest www.klassik-heute.com or www.classicstoday.com, rather than another printed guide."
1,Alternative,"Go for the Penguin Guide, it is more comprehensive than this. I am sure you will appreciate and enjoy reading it as much as I do.Trust me, this is only suitable and appropriate if you are already very well informed on the classical recording industry. The editor only provide a list of the recordings to their preference, unlike Penguin Guide where it give many alternatives for consideration. If you don't believe me, go to the book shop and take a look and make a comparison between these 2 books, before you commit a purchase. I read the 2003 edition, and it is a great disappointment. I will not buy again, Penguin Guide is cheaper and better!"
4,NICE,I wanted to give this 4.5 stars because it arrived on time like it said but the book is a little more worn then I expected but otherwise great service!Thanks Again!!!
4,"Overall, Good Principles of Biology Book","needs to provide a little more detail on some subjects (even though author is limited on writing based on how [much] publishers want them to write); overall, great book for a Principles of Biology course"
4,textbooks,I recieved my books promptly and in good condition. I was very satisfied with my purchases.
1,A dissenting opinion!,"In reviewing this text for possible adoption, I have come to the opposite opinion from other reviewers. I found the book to be written mostly for the faculty and not for the students. It is filled with details totally unnecessary at an introductory level and which will serve only to confuse the students. This is particularly true of the section on evolution and classification which seems to follow every fad and goes so quickly that few will be able to keep up. The beautiful overall picture is totally lost. Although there are fewer pages (a good thing) they have achieved this partly by reducing the size of the print, making the text more difficult to read. The figures are great, but this does not make up for the basic defects in the book."
2,Do NOT mistake this for the full volume!,"Whereas LIFE the Science of Biology is a brilliant book make sure that is what you are buying - LIFE Volume 1 (or anything with a volume number) IS NOT THE SAME THING. Those are PARTIAL editions. In a present advertisement for the 7th full edition, a cheap paperback version is listed but it is NOT the full textbook, just one of the part-works. This is, of course, incorrect but there seems no way to advise Amazon of the fact.This text is confounded by dozens of minor variants, none of which will give you a full biology textbook. ISBNs don't help as there are usually several listed in the full edition & they appear to be for the part-works.To make matters worse, the illustrations shown on Amazon (across the board, in fact) are often of the wrong edition, too. It is no good me telling you that a lion pride graces the front of the 7th ed because the same illustration is being used for these wretched extracts.Be very very careful ..."
5,Wonderful textbook!,"I graduated from college in the early 70's with a B.S. major in Physics. Having retired from the business world, I recently discovered the absolutely wonderous advances in what I believed to be the ""non-physical"" sciences. Hooray for E.O.Wilson's concept of concilience!I'm studying Biology using ""Life"" and its associated website. What amazing fun! I love this book and it is the best textbook I've ever studied. This book is not a good ""read"" - it's a great book to study!"
3,"Usually required, but no better for it","WARNING: this is not the whole textbook! This textbook is sold both as one book and also as THREE volumes. No course requires only one volume, so be absolutely certain it won't be advantageous to simply buy the whole text as one book.My apologies if the above is obvious to you. Somehow, it wasn't obvious to me and I ended up having to buy all three volumes separately.This textbook was used for 7.013 (first semester biology) at MIT when I took it Spring '08. Therefore, you may have to purchase this or a similar text regardless of what I say. If you have a choice, however, I'd say try another text and tell me how that goes. This one is at best mediocre. I thought the author took too long to get to the point in each topic, which made it a laborious read. Because of this, I think the length of this text could be reduced by a quarter of its current length and still successfully cover the same topics."
2,"Great little plate, while it lasts","We bought these for our two girls (2 and 5) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great, for a while.Now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time (5 months since we ordered).They haven't been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat.Same issue with the bowls. YMMV, but when 3 out of 4 are dead, I think there is a problem."
2,Smart camera for just fun,Photosmart 812 digital camera is not the best choice you could spend your money on. It's just OK if you happen to take shots only every now and then. For more serious photography I'd recommend something else. 812 is slow responding to picture taking and it takes too long to get the camera ready. You may lose your quick or moving target in case nothing happens when you press the button in order to take a picture. This model ignores button pressing too often and consumes the battery way too fast.
3,A little harsh the first time..,"Overall the book has a great deal of information. I just think it could be 200+ pages less and still cover everything. For information covered I'd rate it a 5. For length and relevance, a 3. My advice is still to go out and review any book before you buy. Everyone has an opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. I just don't have the time to spend reading over 700 pages."
2,Disappointing,"Having read every word of this lengthy book, I was rather disappointed with it. Personally I could have done without the personal commentaries that proliferated this book, but what really concerned me was that in the end, despite the 800+ pages, the book seemed shallow and never really got into the details of the subject matter the way it should have. The CD-ROM test questions were OK, but the software was flaky and did NOT let you review the Case Study Questions after the test. I found some of the Questions intentionally misleading and the drag and drop questions completely impossible. Don't use the sample questions to judge your ability to take the exam. Also I found it odd that after each chapter I was still unprepared to answer the questions at the end of the chapter.This is a good overview but not enough for the exam. This is my first Sybex book, I am hoping that this is the exception not the rule as I have heard Sybex is generally good."
2,"Chatty, Friendly, but not a study guide","When you get past the repeated patronizing comments about consultants (usually separated by half a chapter from an anecdote about how a consultant ""...saved his bacon..."") the book lacks substance for all of its 800+ pages. The test materials were largely pointless and were not comparable to the exam in format or flavor. The test materials also contained errors that might have been caught and corrected if Mr. Heldman had attempted to show the reasoning (or lack of reasoning) behind his ""answers."" Overall I would rate this book a ""leave on the shelf."" A truly sore spot was his repeated comments about modems, demonstrating that he is totally clueless as to how or why they perform the way they do and leaving one questioning the validity of his other viewpoints, comments and pronouncements. Basically, a book written to fulfill a contract and pay the rent, not to improve the skill level within the profession."
2,I've Never Been to Me - Charlene ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !,"Search for ""Ladies of the 80's Vol 2""to locate the song ""I've Never Been to Me"" by Charlene"
1,Other version of Never been to me,"Hi all...Further to the reviewer aboves comments I thought I would let you know that the name of the other artist who sang this with the pure voice is Charlene. I myself have been trying to find out if she has done an album, but am not having alot of luck. I do know however that you can get the song itself by going to napster.com, and doing a search under 'Ive been to paradise', becuase that was how I found it! Anyone else know anything about Charlene????"
2,I know where you can get Charlenne's version,"Fantastic 80's go for it, soundtrack to Me without you, and Endless Love motown, i too tried for a long time to get this CD so know how you all feel so i hope this info helps, good luck to you all."
1,The Quest for Charlene,"Ok, kids, youre not the only ones who cant find anything on Charlene.....The only thing I could discover is that her rendition of ""Never been to Me"" was #1 on the Australian music charts from the end of June through July 1982 and that it served as the *fantabulous* opening number for ""Priscilla""......Are there any Australians out there who could help us out a bit???"
2,"I,ve Never Been to Me","I have been looking for the song (I,ve never been to me) for a long time,I thought it was done by Anne Murrey, or Olivia Newton John, I think it was in the 70,s. If any one knows who it is by or where I can find it please let me know. Patt@otelco.net"
2,Another artist sung this!,"I am sure another artist has sung this record. The other artist was a woman with a much pure clear voice, a beautiful voice. Can anyone help me to get hold of the name of the artist, I much prefer it to Kaleo o Kalani."
2,HELP,"I too am looking for the the version from O. Newton-John, or Charlene - can anyone email me with a way to find that CD? IHLE2000@aol.com ~ THANKS!"
4,Decent catalog of significant events and people,"While it would be easy to fill dozens of volumes in a ""Cold War Encylopedia,"" this one succeeds in a more difficult task. Thomas Arms manages to put almost 700 entries into one volume and still make it worth reading. Arms provides entries on laws, people, policies, and organizations that shaped the Cold War. Arms arranges all entries in the classic ""inverted pyramid"" style which allows the reader to review the most important information first. Arms also provides cross-references from one entry to another where applicable and a bibliography at the end of most entries. This is an important reference when conducting any research on a time period which is already becoming one of history's most widely debated and discussed issues. This one has it all, from the key players and events to some of the more minor and aomost forgotten ones. Comprehensive companion to have around when reading anything abou this period and its participants. Recommended."
5,Crowell's Handbook of Faulkner,An excellent handbook for anyone who shares a love of Faulkner and a disappearing memory!
1,Not worth trying ...,this driver ... unless you want lots of attention while teeing off ... this makes a wired metallic noise on ball contact. Its cheap but still not worth trying.
2,You get what you pay for,"If you are coming from a wood head and a steel shaft this might be a great driver, but otherwise save you money. You get what you pay for."
2,"Decent driver, UNTIL....","Pretty decent driver. I was getting some nice long drives out of this club, when the club head cracked off the shaft! It was only my second time using the club. I guess it just taught me the reason why people actually spend a couple of hundred dollars on drivers when it seemed there were some decent options for $20! All I can say is- good thing I bought it on Amazon! Returned with paid shipping. On to the next club!!!"
5,Good for the Price,"I bought this driver not knowing what to expect, and I was highly satisfied. It didn't cure my slice, but I didn't expect it to. It hits nice and clean with better distance than my previous 280cc off-brand driver. I was constantly around 260-275 yards, and now I'm around 280-300 consistently. It has a nice light feel, a decent grip, and a nice look in the bag. If nothing else, this driver at least plays consistent. And, for $36, (I'm a lefty) it's a great price. I'd suggest it to all my friends."
3,Cheap driver,"I've used it about three times at the range, and there are already two gigantic dents on the head of the driver.It's only 30 bucks, so I'm not sure what I was expecting. I suggest spending a bit more money on something more sturdy, or just buying five of these and go through them like cheap prostitutes."
1,Don't waste your money,I wasn't expecting much of this club and that's exactly what I got...nothing much!.. Don't waste your money. Investment in something else
5,Works amazingly for me.,I was looking for a bigger cc driver and wanted to buy a low-cost version to minimize my risk as I was not sure if the bigger head will improve my drive. Worked fine and I'm very pleased with it.
5,Big Driver for a little price!,I've played 2 rounds with this club in 10 days. It is long off the tee. The group I normally play with were impressed with the club and how it helped my game. It has added 25 yards over my older driver. This was my first 'larger head' driver...I was a 'hold out' on buying one. I should have bought one sooner! Seems to be very forgiving as a driver goes. I'd recommend you take a chance at a 'solid' under $30 club.
1,Experiment Gone Bad,"As another reviewer gave a low rating, the club head snapped on my second time testing this at the range. It was a clean hit but snapped on the shaft/head connector. From the limited use, my drive distance remained the same as my previous club but I didn't get the chance to see the benefits as everyone else reviewed."
4,Can't beat the price,I am a beginner golfer and this is my first driver. I can't complain about too much with this driver. It does feel a little cheap but that is probably because it is. For a beginner this is a great driver to start with. I have used it several times now and it shows no cracks or anything yet. I do plan on upgrading once I get a little better but this is a great choice for now until I am not worried about breaking an expensive club. I have not tried any other driver yet and so I cannot compare distances.
3,Not bad,"Replaced the grip right away ($10), and generally not a bad product so far. Played like 3 rounds with it. it doesn't have the weight or feel of an expensive driver, but will keep you in play. If you want something for big time results, this ain't it, but it is nice for the person who has time for 6-7 rounds a year like me. If I were rich, I'd get a nike driver, but that's not the case~ :-("
5,"For $20, you can't beat it...","I had been shopping for a good driver for a long time. I was looking to spend around $100-150 until I found this, I read a few reviews and decided to try it out.. first day out it took me about 6 holes to get used to it, but after that I was landing them nice and straight down the fairway with no trouble... Excellent for $20!"
3,Inexpensive driver with some quality issues,"This driver definitely will boom out the big drives you'd expect from a 460cc head. For the price, that's a miracle. But - don't fool yourself into thinking this is high-quality gear. The paintwork is cheap, the head is a generic design that shows up in other mfrs' clubs (albeit at a higher price) and its overall feel doesn't lend one to believe it'll hold up more than a couple seasons. Most crucially, though, I've taken mine out a fair amount in the last six weeks and it already shows clear signs of stress fracturing and surface cracking on the face, right around the sweet spot. I hit a consistent 270-280 yard drive with the club - for now. But I don't hold much hope it's a club that'll live long if used often."
3,Was driving well until it snapped,"Used by a beginner golfer - this driver was relatively easy to use with moderate forgiveness. With a solid swing and contact it would drive the ball true. After about 4 rounds and a dozen trips to the range, the driver snapped where the head meets the shaft (on a swing with all ball contact). I'm purchasing 1 more - and will update my review after using this one for a the remainder of the season. If it lasts - great. If not, I should be at point where I'd want to upgrade anyway."
4,Great Deal!,"I was going to have a driver built for me, but decided to get this for a fun trip with some friends and have now decided that I no longer need a new driver for some time! It does have a graphite shaft, which is already a deal there even if you put a new head and grip on it. The grip is a cheap knockoff but with a good glove it works pretty good. The head is the only real issue I would have with it. Although I have not experienced a problem with it yet I can not tell how durable it is and whether it is a titanium head, although it hasn't dented or changed while playing so I am hoping it is and will be fine. Over all its a great club, feels nice, hits a little soft, and has a lot of bend in the shaft, but makes for a REALLY nice club to start out on."
5,Wow!,"I bought this driver to replace my old wood driver (I know I am behind the times). This driver is unbelievable! Combined with a certain golf ball I hit a drive yesterday of 275 yards, another at 271, and another at 261. I have never hit the ball so far in my lifetime (I am 54 years old btw). It is completely changing my game. I am now getting on par 4's in 2 and I almost drove a par 4 yesterday. Par 5's used to be tough, but I was on in 3 with ease. The club is holding up well under play and I highly recommend it. For the price you can't beat it."
4,it works,"I am a biginner, so I chose this driver which is really cheap. It works as a driver, I guess. The only thing I may want to complain about it is that I can hit the ball with No. 3 wood to the same distance, if not farther, as I use this driver, maybe its my problem."
4,Nice club,Just got this driver for father's day and took it to the range on Sunday. First time I've been able to consistently hit a driver with any distance and accuracy.
4,Great for the Price,The club is great for being under $40. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is do to the grip on the club but its easily fixed by wearing a glove. Took it to the driving range and was easily hitting 250-275 yards.
4,Great club for the price,I am a beginner golfer but find this club very comfortable and get great range out of it. Great color also.
5,Great club!,"I bought this club for my 62 year old father. Neither of us are great golfers by any means, but this driver has increased his distance by atleast 30 yards or so. Not sure if it's the driver or his swing, but it has defintely helped his confidence and game. I also own a Tec driver and when I'm not slicing it into the woods I really do cream the ball pretty far. Very light and durable. Highly recommended for the price."
2,Not a great book for beginners to use,"I just finished my second and third projects out of this book. I encountered a number of problems with the pattern, and the use of non-standard techniques. I understand this book is based on English knitting, but it took two experienced knitters to determine what the pattern was trying to do when creating a repeat. The pattern instructions reference incorrect page numbers when siting ""how-to"" guides. This is very frustrating for a beginner, and had I not had previous sewing experience, two other knitting guides, and experienced knitters to help me I would have given up before finishing the project I set out to finish. I am extremely proud of my final product, and have been told the work is beautiful, but I would highly caution any true beginner from relying on this book as their sole guide."
3,unclear pictures,"The instructions in the book were fine, however the pictures used to show the steps were unclear. For example when the author describes how to cast on the first stich the description calls for you to make a loop and bring the end of the string up through the loop. That sounds easy enough but since in the picture you can't see where she is holding the end in the finished product you are left to experiment on the direction. I am not sure it is the only book you'll need to begin knitting."
1,Horrible,"I thought i was purchasing a documentary on the history of motion pictures. What I got was a bunch of old movie clips, in a horrible 2 dvd set that looks like a bootleg copy. The dvd menu programming is like something you might find in your cousin's wedding dvd (the one your aunt created and burned herself in her pc using some lowsy free software). Both discs have three options in the menu: one takes you to 3 or 4 ramdom movie clips, and the other two options take you to [...] advertising clips.A real masterpiece of film research."
2,does not work with 1 GB card,"works fine on 128K card, does not work with a 1 GB card. There are no driver updates available."
5,Perfectly Lovely Coffee Table Book,"The pictures of Shakespeare gardens in the United State and England are lovely and inspiring. I was disappointed that the garden at the Huntington Library in San Marino, CA was not included, as it was the first such garden I ever visited, but that is just a personal observation. The section on plants that are typically used in a Shakespeare garden was very helpful and I am using the entire book to plot out a tiny garden in my back yard."
4,Useful Resource,"This text was comprehensive and scholarly in its approach. Each chapter provides a very balanced view of research on ageism from definitions and developmental origins to effects on medical practice and portrayals in the media. The presentation of research findings integrated into each chapter was effective, interesting and current. A ""must have"" reference text for anyone interested in this topic."
2,"Head, Neck & Shoulders Massage: A Step-by-Step Guide","Nice looking book, some interesting ideas on visualization. The instructional value for actual massage is very limited. Neck massage, one paragraph. It will be in my next garage sale."
3,oh well,Not worth the money. Very dry. Meaning the book has no meat. If you do chair massage there may be thechniques you can use but this not a book for regular table massage. Great color pictures.
2,Full Metal Yakuza - Cheesy Robo Cop,In Full Metal Yakuza a super wimp Yakuza (whose gringing and weeping got on my nerves) is shot by rival gang members and rebuilt as super Yakuza who sets out for revenge. Here is where you are waiting for Takashi Miike's over the top violence to come in but .....you are sorely disappointed. Super Yakuza is more bad comedy than good and gore hounds will be left hanging as our hero eats nuts and bolts for breakfast and admires his hefty rebuilt manhood. Entertaining in parts but not the Takashi that I was hoping for.
5,This excellent book teaches parents topics about literacy,"I feel like this book changed my life. I now have a new perspective of everything, especially reading. I know Prisca and Sarah well and I understand them fully and incoherently. I love this book and I'm sure it will change your life too."
2,What does this have to do with my class?,"This is not the fault of the author, but more of my instructor. He had us read this book and discuss it in a forum, but did not provide any of his own insights. It's a good book in that it shows the reader that being literate is not just about spelling words correctly and then putting them together in a way that makes sense. Literacy is so much more."
2,Philosophizing about Martial Arts,"Schmieg philosophizes about Martial Arts. There is also some Chinese history and sociology thrown in as well. Not that it wasn't interesting or thought provocking in parts but overall this book didn't do much for me. Plus Schmieg comes off like one of these white guys who believe everything Asian is superior to everything ""western"". I just wasn't that impressed with Watching Your Back."
3,Simply beautiful!,"I just opened the super cute box and found the little sparkling earrings for my little cutie. They are just awesome! I was expecting them to be very small, but they fit just right on my 21 month old daughter. The diamonds are not that small and are easily noticeable. My daughter lost a pair before so I was looking for a screw-back one this time and found the right one. Very happy with the purchase and planning to buy 1 more pair for my niece.------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: (3/26/2012)I was taking her t-shirt off and the earring split into two....the diamond came off with the cup holding it! I got it repaired from the local jewellery-fix shop but now the quality of the studs stands questionable."
1,"Guide is useless, I know as i am a veteran player","The guide is worthless, guides do not , will not, work for online games, heck i looked at my friends guide at ""online prices of items"" that doesnt work, you see, EQ has an economy, Items raise and drop in prices, like for instance the fungul regrowth tunic, used to be 20 k, now 40k as its price raised, finding the right spells is not hard, right click spell and it wsill tell you, its VERY easy to get the hang of the game if you just read the manual. If you need maps look for them online, need quests you can also find them online, this strategy guide all in all is not worth your money"
2,One of Beverly's poorest efforts,"I really wanted to like this book since it contains so many familiar characters, especially Piers Verderan. However, the writing is sloppy is so many ways. There are numerous grammatical and typographical errors. There are far too many characters to keep up with. There are 2 sets of lovers and neither story is utterly compelling. In fact, the supposed primary set becomes the secondary set as the book continues. Beth is often the viewpoint character, but rarely the romantic heroine. And Sir Marius is simply not given enough depth. In addition, there are several scenes that are simply fluff and do nothing for the narrative or charatcer development. The entire scenario is far-fetched as well. One might want to read it for background on other characters, especially Verderan (from the excellent Emily & the Dark Angel), but it's not a buy or a keeper."
1,Received 2 different parts & my Check engine light is still on,"I ordered 2 of these to replace the ones in my 2003 MINI Cooper. When I received the parts they were 2 different UPC numbers & the sensors were different. They both fit, but one must have been an older model or design & the other a newer one. They both fit properly and simply plugged into the existing wire harnesses, however I am still getting codes for faults with both of the O2 sensors."
5,Perfect fit on a 2005 Mini Cooper S...,"Alright, I'm not sure if this is an exact OEM part, but, it works flawlessly. Installation only took about 15 minutes and the fit spot on. Even the plugs are exact... Thought this would be a better option than the universal O2 sensor because I have heard that Mini's are ""picky"" about the parts you use on them. Will update this review in the future if I feel something needs to be updated."
4,Fine to replace main-cat O2 sensor ONLY - DO NOT USE FOR PRE-CAT,"I have a 2003 MINI Cooper S:Having originally replaced both O2 sensors with what I though was the OEM replacement - (Bosch) - I was still getting a repetitive CEL. The issue is that in the Pre-cat O2 position, the MINI has very specific tolerances for the O2 sensor installed or it will throw a code. You will need a 22mm wrench and the NTK/NGK 25648 sensor in the pre-cat position. The Bosch 13878 O2 sensor is less expensive and works fine in the main-cat position. If you are thinking about replacing the pre-cat O2 sensor, DO NOT install the Bosch or you will have the same code and poor gas mileage.The best (cheapest and most effective) way to replace both O2 sensors and not have codes is to replace the main car O2 sensor with the Bosch 13878 Oxygen Sensor and the pre-cat O2 sensor with the NTK/NGK 25648 Oxygen Sensor, considering that the NTK sensor is more expensive than the Bosch at the time of this review."
5,Need some books about hospital accounting,"I will teach some concept about hospital accountiny at the Nursey School in my University, I think this book could help me to improve my knowledge about thgis topic. I"
3,CALORIES HAVE DOUBLED AND FAT CONTENT IS UP COMPANY IS NOT ADVERTISING NEW FORMULATION,I have been using these bars for about a year. Apparently they changed the formula 7 months ago and never disclosed the formula change. Lets face it when purchasing a product we do not re-read the calorie and ingredient list EACH time we purchase it UNLESS it says formula change or New or gives us some indication thre has been a change. Seems almost illegal to not say so on the lable front.So careful people. You could almost have a small meal now for the calories they contain.
3,for the health conscious eater,"Excellent cold pressed green bar for those raw foodists or health nuts looking for a great snack with nutritional integrity. If this is your first time eating a raw bar, be advised, the taste and the texture of this bar reflect its' ingredients."
5,SATISFYING,Repeat customer.... Have used this product for about one year and it is an ideal meal replacement or on-the-go meal. Very satisfying taste and nutritional value.
5,Best Bars Ever,I absolutely love these energy bars. I am addicted to them because they taste so delicious and I know I am doing something really good for my body. If you haven't tried them yet you should!
5,Greens Plus Energy Bars Are Great!,It's amazing something so healthy can taste so great! I've been eating Greens Plus Energy Bars (Chocolate covered) for a couple of years - they give you that mid-afternoon boost without the highs and lows of sugar and caffeine while giving you enough nutrition you could skip a meal if you wanted to. I highly recommend them to health-conscious consumers that need snacks to make it through the day!
4,Almost 5 stars but...,"as delicious as these bars are (a little reminiscent of peanut butter cups!), I don't like where they are heading. They are changing the formula somewhat. Tampering with perfection!!! The chcolate coating is getting thinner and thinner so its almost paper thin and sometimes the consistency is a little off.They were perfect about 4 months ago when I thought I would eat these forevever. Now I am starting to look for my next favorite thing! Seems like someone is finding ways to shave costs and the product is starting to suffer.Still - this is by far the best tasting and healthiest guilty pleasure for a fit lifestyle so try it - you are probably not as picky as me!"
2,Stale Product,"I've been eating these bars for years and they are the healthiest you can eat and delicious! Unfortunately, this past year I've received stale product on several occassions. They do not have a very long shelf life."
2,greens+-what happened?,"I am one of the very upset customers who used to LOVE these energy bars! They were the best on the market and I would go through several boxes in couple of months. It is almost impossible to find great tasting and healthy snack bar that has only 162 cal., but my last order was a big surprise! Jump from 162 to 240, much more fat and carbs- WHY? The company should really think twice before such a drastic change without warning!I am truly hoping they will go back to the original version and if you have the same opinion please call the number on the package and let them know!Thank you"
1,This product contains sugar.,"I ordered this product based on the information that it was sweetened with dates and honey. Raw Cane syrup was not mentioned as an ingredient. Unfortunately, they neglected to state that the Chocolate covering is sweetened with Raw Cane Syrup, i.e. sugar. I am very careful to avoid cane sugar and so, was disappointed that the ingredient list was incomplete. I rated it one star, because it was not as advertised."
1,"If you like ""yuck"" you'll love these","This is what has given energy bars a bad name. Of course, they're good for you, but there are lots of things available that are good for you and taste good, too. This isn't one of them."
4,Good Book,"The book has alot of good info. and recipes. But if you are looking for pictures this book just has drawings of a few pieces of cast iron. Having said that I still like the book for the information it gives and some good recipes. Its also has a recipe for Bison and Venison and other wild animals cowboy cooking, cajun cooking, mexican cooking ect... An enjoyable read."
5,This is a beautiful watch!,"I loved this watch the minute I saw it. So, I've just bought it, and I got it at a very good price too! It looks both modern and classic, it works great and the quality is amazing for such an unexpensive watch! I'm very pleased with it!"
2,Disappointing rebrand of another DVD,"I received this two disc set as a Christmas gift and just got a chance to watch it. Unfortunately disc one seemed overly familiar to me. This is because it is also sold as ""Ultimate Nascar DVD Collection - Nascar Thrills"". Disc two may be a ""repeat too, but I'm not familiar with it. I wish companies would stop reissuing product under different names. It is dishonest and disaapointing."
5,Nascar -Full Throttle,I enjoyed every minute of this two DVD set. This is definitely an awesome gift for all you Nascar Fans
4,talking clock,Although my 99 year old mother in law could not adequately push the button or hear clearly a talking watch this talking clock with a BIG button works easily and has adequate sound volume. She is very pleased with it.WRL
4,Nice clock,"Nice clock but could be louder, not great if you have hearing problems. The alarm is loud enough and I really like the LED light. Press the top button for the time and you can also see the time too."
4,Sound,"Sound is not loud enough to hear over noise, the room has to be quiet in order to hear what time it is."
2,Talking clock .... didn't do as much as I was hoping,The clock was fine for what it did and it was probably my fault for not realizing what it wouldn't do. My mother-in-law was looking for a clock that would tell her the time and date. This one only told the time. I ended up purchasing a different Reizen talking clock that did both things.
3,"It is good, but I would'nt go overboard on the praise","Its really an Italian version of The Graduate with some twisty sub-plots. Naturally these foreign films will be a bit more sexual, and this one does has one scene with oral action in it(certainly not as graphic as the cross-over film 'the image'). Overall my 3 star rating is perhaps a bit conservative, its good but don't expect to be 'blown' away."
4,devil in the flesh,"this movie is one of the most controversial italian films of the 80s.caused a critical uproar upon it's release due to its highly-charged political and sexually frank subjet matter. is about a young woman engaged to marry a man who's sitting behind bars because his political activity. restless in her appetite and inner turmoil, she meets a young student and a passionate affeir quickly ensues......... is a good movie i recommended."
5,Maruschka Detmers the perfect Borderline Girl,"This is an amazing movie, very balanced, all details thought out, as perfect as can be. Marco Bellochio sketches, on the mere pretence of using the story by Radiguet, using the setting of Italy in the years of 'the strategy of tension',a pathology that in those years not even had the name of 'borderline', nor was recognized as such. With long shots, he forces his main actor, the Dutch Maruschka, to the max. She gives an incredable rendering of this type of person. Moreover, she is so beautiful, her laugh is so enticing (and foreboding the worst), that you will never forget her, nor the story. Marco Bellochio is one of the few film directors who have never yielded to commerce. He is a gran maestro, one of the greatest. You can see this movie again and again, it never will deluse you. It has a slow development of tension that will keep you entranced."
1,Disappointing.,I was excited when I ordered this but after many transfers was very disappointed with it. The biggest problem is that you think all is being recored and then it fails to finish. And since it is done in real time you end up wasting many hours with no finished product.
2,Rather Slow,"This author's first loyalty was not to the reader. I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. The author also tried to go down the path of the ""dark, brooding"" lead and he did not pull it off. Overall, not that great of a book. There are many others out there that are better."
5,Very inspirational! This book should be required reading!,"Mariah Burton Nelson writes a very moving book. She is honest, objective, sincere, and sensitive. When I read ""The Unburdened Heart"", many feelings, emotions, new ideas, and fresh goals are provoked in me. Mariah Burton Nelson is truly inspirational. I want to read the ""5 keys ..."" again to fully grasp these profound ways of ""opening the heart."""
4,Zip disk purchased from Nalley thru Amazon,Product was exactly what I wanted. Product works fine. I'm very sorry delivery got screwed up and took so long. Product is just a Zip disk for my old computer. It works fine and as to product I;m happy. As to conduct of Amazons vendor I'm very disgusted and will never use Amazon again.
4,Good price,"Our 3 year old loves Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang, but wasn't too crazy about this film for some reason. Having said that, Amazon had the best price on the DVD, which is now part of our collection. Hopefully he'll like this classic film as he gets older."
5,DVD,Great company. They were very quick in sending my order. The order was exactly as they published on their site.
4,Cute,"I bought this DVD for my grandson, who have a few othe Peanuts vids. The quaity of the original isn't steller, but it's OK."
4,Cute,"The peanuts gang are up to their usual mischief in preparation for Easter Sunday, but no one seems to be listening to Linus. He swears that the Easter Beagle will come and make the celebrations complete. Typically no one listens to him, he is little bit 'Ralph Wiggum' remember.Though Snoopy ends up being that very Beagle, he's far too busy trying to help out Woodstock. The poor little bird is freezing in his cruddy little nest full of cold water. So Snoopy goes off to the mall (already advertising Xmas goodies!) to buy him a bird house. With hilarious results.After much hijinks and endless trips to the mall for eggs (Marcie keeps smashing them as she doesn't know how to do egg-painting) Snoopy saves the day and proves Linus right after all. Sigh! They don't make 'em like this anymore. I'll tale Snoopy over Spongebob any day.I have not seen It's Arbor Fay, Charlie Brown so I cannot review it yet.The DVD is in 1.33:1 full frame, as drawn, with Dolby Mono sound."
3,A slower pace for Charlie Brown,"This Charlie Brown movie didn't quite grab my grandson's attention like the other ones. Whereas he replays the Great Pumpkin and his all-time favorite, the Sports DVD, this one has not been a duplicate request."
5,Adorable!,"My daughter gets scared from most cartoons - not sure why they all need an antagonist. I'm talking to you Disney! This one is just sweet and cute and easter-ish, but not religious. Great show."
4,Just so darn cute!,"We've had this movie on VHS for years and I just got it on DVD for my family's house.This movie is just so darn cute!I don't understand why this holiday special isn't in the Peanuts Holiday Box Set, which has all the others."
2,Ok,I liked this movie it was ok for a short film. But truthfully I almost could not watch it and for part of it I dint wach it. This film is probally good for a rainy day. I mainly recomend this for younger vewers. Who like Charlie Brown or know him and his movies a lot.
1,SNOOPY LAYS EGG,"Take Chevy Chase and his hijinx comedy multiplied by a factor of about a thousand, and you've got this spring junker that completely eschews anything like artistic intuition or style. The first 10 minutes is clogged with wheezing routines that appear to have no punch, and no punch lines. Hold your breath, watch and wait for the Easter spirit to rise up from the Easter egg patch but don't be surprised when you find you've turned ""blue"". ""It's the Easter Beagle Charlie Brown"" is a trail of animation gags. The only thing missing was a magic act- I wish they could make this movie disappear.Walt Disney turned over when he saw this holiday chestnut."
5,Love this one!,"Kids got a kick out of it,it was so funny to them. This brings back good childhood memories and its the beginning of spring."
5,Very unique colors and very durable!,"Got this for my daughter and she loves it!She recently made a tie dye shirt in her class so when I showed this to her she really liked it!Very tough for the price, have not not seen any wear and tear so far or any color fading."
1,Do not buy this,I threw this ball into the trash as soon asI read sticker on its package wrapping thatit is not in compliance with CA toxic chemicalsban. Come on! This is a child's ball. DoNOT buy it.
2,flat ball!,"Rec'd. this ball which I ordered as a gift for a 2 yr. old. Came flat with no air! I have no equipment with which to inflate it, and cannot give it as a gift flat. This should have been stated in the description. So, it must go back."
2,Champion Sports Tie Dye Soccer ball size 3,"Frist of all, I have been ordering from Amazon for many years and this is the frist time I have ever written a review. I ordered this soccer ball for Christmas, in a size 3 for my 6 year old daughter. The colors are bright and ture to the photo. This ball is in noway close to a size 3. It is a little bigger then a softball and is the shape of an egg. Needless to say I am very unhappy. Don't waste your money."
1,No quality,"I was excited about this ball. Good price, good color not to get lost.. The stitching is horrible, uneven, and the seams came split. It also says its a size 5 but next to my other size 5s it is small, probably a 4. Not good at all!!!"
1,Ball,This ball isn't a true size 4 I wouldn't recommend this product I was very disappointed with it and would have returned it but it was a gift .
3,Not true to size,My daughter loves this ball. But had I known that the size 4 would have been the size of a 3 - I would haveordered a 5.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased several of these soccer balls for my students to use during recess and P.E. The surface material is very thin, and did not last more than a day without getting completely scratched, faded, and scarred with holes."
1,"Great tye dye, poor choice of ball","Bought this Size 5 ball for my 9 1/2 year old daughter for Easter (2012). Ball comes flat, when pumped up, not a full size 5, much smaller than any one I have ever seen. Oh well, hoped her coach would not notice, after all...it looked good, cool design. Well, after one day of kicking it around, the surface of the ball is peeling away. Very disappointed as daughter loved the ball when it arrived in her basket."
1,Look Elsewhere,"My wife purchased two of these balls for our kids. The only compliment I can give them is that they are colorful.The build quality on these balls is horrible. They aren't spherical -- not even close. They have an overall oblong shape and the occasional protrusion here and there. The seam quality is awful. Some of the stitches are close together, some are far apart. Many of the stitches stick up far enough to be rough to the touch -- a huge no-no on a soccer ball. And no, the balls don't hold air very well. We have to pump ours up regularly.I've been a soccer referee for over half of my life and I've seen some pretty awful soccer balls. These rank among the worst."
1,NOT a size 4,"I needed a replacement size 4 soccer ball for my son, as the cover has become abraded on his current ball. He wanted a unique design to readily tell it from the others on the team and he picked this one. Great design and vivid colors. Although its marked as a size 4 on the ball, it is WAY SMALLER than his and his teammates current size 4 balls when inflated to the maximum pressure listed on the ball. Its definitely going back. Now I have to pay to return it when its not what it was advertised to be."
4,Cute and fun ball!,"This ball was adorable when it arrived, I loved the colors. Unfortunatly I bought it for my dog and she tore it apart in hours. It was fun while it lasted!"
3,great ball,It came in flat. other than that it's a great ball. It was given as a gift. they just had to pump it up
1,Terrible,"We pumped the ball up, and the first day my daughter used it there were cracks along, and between the seems!"
4,"Great looks, okay quality for the money.","I bought this for my 6 year old grandson. He loves the colors. The quality seems to be on par with other soccer balls in that price range. It does come flat, so be prepared to pump it up when you get it."
5,Love it. Great color.,"Great ball, great price. It works well. It came faster than expected in the mail. Very happy with our purchase."
4,Our soccer ball is fine,"My 12-year-old son received this ball for Christmas. It comes flat in the box and has to be inflated. After reading the reviews, I was a little wary as to whether this was a good selection. However, he has had 2 other balls stolen at games, so he wanted something distinctive. It must be hit or miss with this product. We have a size 4 and eight months later, it's fine. He used it for indoor winter and spring soccer practice. He has used it with friends on a artificial turf field for scrimmage. We have had to pump it up a few times because it has gone soft, but it's never gone flat. It's the correct size and we were careful when we inflated it the first time, using a presure gauge to get the right pressure. It is more purple and yellow than the other colors of orange/green, but everyone knows it's his ball which has prevented it from being stolen or lost. The color does scratch off with play. He likes this unusual ball and it has worked out for us."
1,Doesn't hold air,Bought this to look different than all the rest of the balls out there. Well it looks different alright. FLAT! Ball shipped flat and a week after inflating the ball it's FLAT again.Should have zero stars every time you use this ball it must be inflated.I Left it out on the lawn over night and it was still there the next day even the thieves don't want this FLAT ball haha!
1,Ball does not stay inflated,This ball needs to be inflated every few hours....the ball is a little small. Would never buy this ball again.
3,Hellmuth not a good teacher,"Phil Hellmuth is hands down one of the greatest tournament players of all time; however, his ability to effectively communicate and teach in the DVD format leaves a LOT to be desired. If you are a beginning player, you will get a lot out of these DVD's; however, if you are a mid-range to advance player...save your money."
1,This is awful!,"What is happening to this great series??? I LOVE the TB books, and now they go to EVENTING? Please! They were the only racing books out there, Joanna Campbell, where are you?!? I havent read this new one, but I am dissapointed to see Cindy, Mandy, Tor, Sammy, all the greats going...at least I can read the other books over!"
1,To all disatisfied fans (important),dear fellow readers I talked to Joanna Campbell herself and disccovered the current series written by Allison Estes is to completely destroyed the horseracing aspect of it and she can't stop it but Joanna Campbell is starting a series called the Ashleigh series beginng in september so if you want to read a story by her be on the look out P.s. for futher updates just ask
1,What happend here????,"Where did Joanna Campbell and racing go to? I liked Allison E's other book Short Sturrup Club books, but really, I think she should stick to short sturrups! What happend to Samantha? And what happeed to the TB spirt!I've read all the books in the seires and I'm shocked that shey had to end so badly!Come on people! Think TB RACING!"
1,THIS IS A TERRIBLE BOOK! Get rid of Allison Estes!,"Joanna where are you??? Allison Estes is the worst writer I've ever heard of! What happened to Tor and Samantha getting married? And where are Cindy and her friends, and Wonder, Glory, Townsend Princess, and all the others! Even Brad and Lavinia are gone. What's up with that??? I stopped reading the series when Christina grew up. First she was three months old, then three years, and now she's twelve. Talk about your stupid changes! I thought Lavinia was having a baby! What a terrible author. I didn't even like number 24, and by the way, since when is Melanie important???!!!"
3,I think this book was OK,"This book was OK but still I think that Allison Estes is a really bad author. If Melanie promised not to ride any horse a gain, then why did she ride Pirate?!?!?! Where did Cindy go???? I can't believe that such a bad writer is writing this series. The books are so much shorter! Plus, it never says that Caroline dies(Melanie's mom. I got the feeling that it was her because Ashleigh nor Mike had a brother named Will). It never says what happened to Jilly, Linda, Max, Tor, Mandy, Heather, Cindy, Wonder's Champion, March to Glory, Honor Bright, Glory's Joy, Mr. Wonderful, Townsend Princess. . . . . ."
5,great story,"I really loved this book. If I were Melanie, I would probably feel like trash. I can relate to the way Melanie feels when she leaves New York. I think this book was well written with a good plot."
4,I like Pirate a whole lot!!!,"I like Pirate alot, and Melanie's pretty good. I didn't like her in #24, but I sort of like her now. HEY!!! I'm lookin' for an e-pal! If anybody wants to be pals to talk horses (strictly horses) we need to talk. I'm 11 years old, totally insane about horses (I'm like Ashleigh, Cindy, Christina's GOOD side, and Melanie), I want to be a jockey, and if you be my e-pal I'll tell you more. So e-mail me at the adress above."
1,Very Confusing,"This book was good, as long as you hadn't read the other ones in the series. I mean, when Ms. Estes started writing, the books about cindy just disapeared. i mean, who could NOT have noticed that there were more than FIVE books about cindy?? And what about samantha? and Tor? and Yvonne? And Beth? and Jilly? and all the old characters, and the horses? Fleet Goddess, Princess, Mr. Wonderful? Lucky Chance? Please, oh please fix them. they just don't make any more sense...."
2,"whoa, what happened!? ö¿",Good god! I speak for myself and for everyone else who loved the Thoroughbred series. This new person S****. She cannot capture the special feeling you get when you read Thoroughbred. Where's Cindy? I will say though that I do like the fact that Ashleighs old friend Mona is teaching Cristina. Thats more like it. But still. JOANNA PLEASE COME BACK!! YOU RULE!! WE MISS YOU!!
2,Not Very Good!,"Joanna what happend!?!?! How can you let ALISON ESTIES ruin this seris. Its unfair,like many other people said this is the only seris that has HORSE RACING in it! Now that ALISON is writing them they're begining to sound like the SADDLE CLUB series. And I did'nt think that #24 was that bad. But #25 was really bad. And I would like to keep Sammy in Kentuky with Tor. And as for Cindy, where did she go? And what happend to Christina, she sounds like a brat. Where did Honor go? And I hope whoever said that Joanna would write a book on Ashleih is right.Joanna please e-mail me. JOANNA CAMPBELL PLEASE COME BACK!"
1,this book stinks,"actually if i couldda i wouldda given this book a negative 10alison wrote some really good stories in her own series, but how dare she come along and take a successful series that joanna campbell started and destroy it.one other reader mentioned that joanna is going to be back this fall with a asleigh series--HOORRAY.i have kept my mouth shut when karen bentley wrote badly--i truly wanted to give her a chance but not now.i'm sorry joanna that i won't be buying this book any longer--alison has truly ruined it by wanting to bring her own expertise of eventing to it. if she didn't know anything about racing--all she had to do was call keeneland and they wouldda helped her anyway they couldda."
1,This Cant be happening!,Couldnt Joanna Campbell take the series back andstart over from book #23? Christina's attitude is AWFUL! She shouldnt be allowed around those horses. Her mother wouldnt if she had acted like that. Sombody should send Christina over to the Saddle Club Series! Allison Estes has totally ruined the series. Somebody should tell her to go soak her head in a big bowl of kool aid! Can the person who said she talked to Joanna Campbell please email me? I would like to have some updates on the Ashleigh series. and I dont understand why she cant stop it.
1,WHERE DID YOU GO JOANNA???,"These books about Cindy's cousin, Melanie, is a stupid idea. I liked learning about the world of racing with Ashleigh, Mike, Sammy, Tor, Cindy, Max, and all of the others. Changing it to eventing was not a wise choice. We'll get eventing from dinky Saddle Club books. I think Alison Estells should continue her own sereies, and let Joanna Campbell continue writing (I think) the best horse series ever written. I want to find out what happens to Honar Does she go to the Kentucky Derby? Triple Crown? We've only seen up to her second race. AND WHY DID THEY SELL LEGACY! That was stupid to sell Legacy for Sterling. Please come back Joanna. Everyone wants the reputition of Thouroughbred to continue... with RACING THOROUGHBREDS! I'm looking forward to the AShleigh Sereies."
2,Better.................,"I am N-O-T not going to say I am in love with this book. It is in fact a small improvement on the authors part. Melanie is better behaved then Christina, while Christina is still a brat. Wonder's Pride is actually mentioned in this book but none of the other horses are. Cindy is still not mentioned. For those of you who don't know Melaine is Christina's ""cousin"". The next book looks really stupid and I bet it stinks."
2,where did everybody go!,"It was not the best book of TB. Also where is Cindy, Max, Tor, Samatha's baby, Christina's brother or sister, Jilly, and why did Samantha go to Ireland all of a sudden. And where did Honor, Glory, and Glory's Joy go! There are tons of people and horses missing with this new writer, Allison E."
2,I don't get it!,This book is confusing if you've read almost all the Thoroughbred books. First of all it says that Melanie is the daughter of mike's sister. I don't remember them mentioning Mike having any brothers or sisters. And why did Samantha move to Irland? In Samantha's Journey Samantha was going to be a trainer at Whitebrook farm and marry Tor. It's like this new writer has no Idea what TB books are all about. Almost all the old characters just disapeared. I hope someone does something about this soon.
3,What Happened?!?!,"I am a huge fan of Joanna Campbell and the Thoroughbred series, and I have never had reason to complain about her books. But Melanie does not belong in this series! What happened to Cindy, Sammy and the others??? How could Christina and Kevin be thirteen when they were only a year old five books ago?? I hope that this series returns to what it started out to be: racing."
3,At least this was human!,"I feel that this book is alot better than 24, 26, 27, & 28. You know why? Because it is about RACING, NOT ABOUT EVENTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love horses, and sports involving horses, but this is a RACING SERIES!!! By Heidi"
1,It wasn't that good,"This book was good, but only if you haven't read any of the other TB books.Melanie has an accident back where she lives in New York, and her father sends her to live with Ashleigh, Mike, and Christina. Melanie comes and is a complete snob. She did something in New York (I won't say what and ruin it for the people who haven't read it) and swears she won't go near another horse again. Eventually she does get close to horses again.I have written to Joanna Campbell, and she has told me that she is making sure the books get better. I also know another thing, but I won't tell what and ruin it, but it is a good thing!! Feel free to e-mail me, fellow TB fans!"
1,IT WAS THE WORST!,Joanna where are you? Allison is not the best author! It is a horrible book and I hope that Joanna will come back! Where did all the the old charactors go like Wonder and Ashleigh and Cindy! And whatt about Lavina's baby! Did it just die? What is going on Joanna! I refuse to read this series which is such a shame because they were great books!
5,Understandable,"The book indeed does not contain the material I thought it would: I thought I get to know a huge amount of different stochastic processes, maybe even learn how to solve stochastic differential equations. Nevertheless, I have learnt things that were inaccessible to me before (e.g. what's the idea behind a filtration?), therefore I rate the book at 5 stars. A very good and understandable introduction."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I am giving this book two stars based on its usefulness for me. I am wading through the book now, and it's going very slowly.I made the mistake of equating teaching stochastic processes through exercises as meaning that those exercises were application oriented. It turns out that there is very little application in the book at all, so I am having a hard time with it.I just wanted to warn other business academics (and non-mathematicians in general) who might be tempted to make the foray into stochastic processes by way of this book. Despite brief opening remarks in each chapter about where these concepts might be applied, you're pretty much left on your own to imagine how. Plus, you need to realize that it's written for someone who came up through the ranks as a mathematician, not a (albeit quantitatively oriented) business scholar."
5,curco vain,"Excelent book. It has a lot of examples and excersices but the best thing is that all of them are resolved. This is a very important characteristic of this book. You can practice a lot but if you don't have a clue and don't have the help of your teacher maybe you can being losing your time. But no, this book is very different from anothers and it is perfect for people who likes to learn by themself and obviously it is perfect for a text book in a class. One thing in cos about this book is in the part of brownian motion the authors don't much pay attetion to explain the intuative idea behind the brownian motion and this is very sad and bad. The number of pages of this book are short and maybe this is the reason why the authors don't take much time to explain all the thing in a very good sense. I would like that oll the book were written like they.Buy this book without doubt.cheers from Lima Perú"
1,Only for Math majors,"I was hoping to use this for self-study.The only real way to learn is through examples, but thenthey have to be the right level of examples.If you arr a finance guy and wana-be finance quant guy/gal - this book will be of no use."
3,Get a battery backup for your projector!,"This product is necessary for the use of your projector. Obviously! =) Unfortunately it is VERY $$$$$$, and the life of the lamp does not last a long time. When using projectors, the lamp needs to be cooled for a bit before completely shutting down, otherwise the life of the lamp diminishes. This was the case with the lamp that came with the projector that I purchased. It would be a good investment to purchase a computer UPS when using a projector to make sure that the lamp gets ""clean"" and consistent power as well as providing power in situations where you have a sudden blackout. This will give you some time to do a proper shutdown of the projector and also provide power for at least a minute or so to cool down the lamp!"
3,Works for the Price,"The bulb works as expected. It was not one of the cheaper ones. But there was no manufacturer's name, detail or clear instructions."
4,"What can I say, a replacement lamp.","I purchased it as a replacement as the last lamp was at end of life. Nice and bright. A bit of difficulty getting it in and working properly, due to a loose electrical connection on the lamp plug (the part that came with the lamp.) The lamp window was cracked when it arrived, but that doesn't affect the image quality."
4,I LOVE IT,I RUN IT ALL THE TIME. VERRY COST EFFICTIVE WAY TO REDUCE ALLERGENS IN SMALL SPACES. THE FORMER TENET WAS A SMOKER AND THE SENT IS GONE. I ASLO HAVE TWO CATS AND IT'S GREAT FOR DANDER.
2,Fan is making a new noise!,Stick with the larger units for longevity. We have two bigger units and they are both still working perfectly after almost 1 year of constant use. The smaller unit that we purchased at the same time is making a new noise. It sounds like the fan motor bearings may be wearing out.
5,one of the most uplifting live shows caught on tape.,if you like well polished quartet singing with top notched musicians playing while they sing this is the ticket. everybody is playing and singing but the lead singer who has truly earned the name henry;the workhorse'rankin shines on this cd.leave it to jesus.wait on the lord are two favorites the guitarist craig johnson also shares lead vocals and does a uplifting version of walter hawkins washed in the blood. this is one of the best gospel recordings i've heard all year.
1,Lumiscope Undersized Support Truss,"This truss was in no way even close to the sizing guideline. This particulal garment is even too small for a child. I would guess that to get a garment that fits properly, one would have to order three sizes larger than the guideline suggests. The no refund policy makes matters even worse. I elected to toss this garment rather than enter into an argument regarding size. I could not get this garment on past my knees. Read the other reviews of this product, and you will see the biggest issue is fitment. They are just way smaller than advertised, and I am disapointed that Amazon has not acted on this issue. Purely a waste of time, energy, and money. I would not recommend this product."
4,Does the Job,"A little uncomfortable, and your scrotum has the nasty habit of falling out of a slit on the bottom. But for the price, and what it does, it's def worth buying."
4,Good product,"Great Item, does the job. My hip size is 35 and the medium was a good fit. Only problem is the material is kinda cheap and the stitching on some parts came off and had a tear. Had to remove the foam pad on the right side coz my hernia was on the left and 2 of it made it uncomfortable. Like it was crushing my jewels. They should make this where you can remove the foam pads without removing the stitches. But overall it does the job. Just be careful when u sit or squat to do something coz the foam pads move around and it gets misplaced and you'll have to ""re-adjust"" the pads to put pressure on the area where you have the hernia."
2,Not quite right,"The pads are not adjustable at all, so if your hernia does not pop out at the same place the pad is, it won't work for you. For me it will sometimes hold for a while, but then it shifts when I sit down and then it doesn't hold any more. I removed the pad from the other side with scissors as I have a hernia on only one side. That helped a little bit, but it is not reliable. If the pad was a bit lower or could be adjusted I would like this."
2,Truss,Wrong size. It was my own fault they didn't fit and I am not sure it was the right item to get.
2,Not impressed,Elastic velcro strip difficult to keep in place. .Would also have liked ability to remove one of the two supports- for singular hernia.
1,Hernia support? Not in bathroom....,Fits nice but......So trick is have your hernia under presure right? What about when you're using bathroom and sitting on tube? Wear another one ?
4,Did the Trick,"This truss did what it said. Any of these things is going to be uncomfortable as anything to get started, but you get use to it. It allowed me to go through my day without worry and pain from the hernia. It is also very light and breathes well. I would also get a size larger than you think."
5,Relief from Hernia,"I'm a keen golfer and developed an inguinal hernia recently, as it will be at least 2 months before I can get it fixed I tried this support truss. It is great - I wear over cotton jersey boxer briefs and apart from feeling rather warm in Florida weather I have had no discomfort playing golf 3 times a week. After a couple of days I got another so that I could rotate. Sizing is good, I am a lightweight 34 inch waist and bought the medium-large, it is fine. I think that I have been lucky."
3,Support Truss Functionality and Comfort,"Overall these run very small, while they do the job, they are extremely uncomfortable to wear due to the fabric used. They should be lined with a cotton material which would make them feel much more tolerable on the skin. Attaching the elastic bands behind you alone with the Velcro is impossible and you need someone to help the first time.....then leave it attached for it's next use. Access for urination is very difficult and really needs a redesign. You really work up a sweat getting it on and don't drink to much liquid if you're planning on going out and have to use public restrooms. It's obvious that whoever designed it has never wore it. It is overpriced and there must be something else more comfortable that will do the job. Look around before purchasing this item."
5,This is working for me.,"For the record I am a health care professional and know how to research a subject. When I experienced the hernia I spent a week checking out surgical and nonsurgical options. Padded, nonpadded, flatpadded truss, belts, full briefs, etc. This is one of three types that I ordered. I tried each with pads, without pads, over and under my underwear, genitals inside and hanging outside. I am 6 foot 3 inches tall, 220lbs with 44 inch hips. The large fits tight which is what is needed. Over the last 5 months I have ordered a total of 7 so that I can wear them fulltime (24/7) as underwear. I removed both pads, everything hangs out thru the bottom opening, and I wear a pair of briefs over them. I have had no protrusion while wearing this support and now just consider it the new norm for daily wear."
4,Okay product,"This runs small for sure, just buy one size up and you should be fine, works well enough and usually improves my comfort level, and I hope the same for you."
1,"Bought two, got one","I ordered two of these, they shipped one. I sent about three emails and got no replies. The item was good, but I did not get what I ordered."
3,Pain in the hernia,Nice attempt at keeping the hernia in but it doesn't work for mine. My hernia eventually comes out and then is pinched making it sore. With basically a no return policy if you open the package..good luck.
1,Lumiscope,"This product was not quite as I expected as the hernia pads do not appear to be sewn in the correct location compared to other trusses and press the wrong direction. I contacted the manufacturer, Graham Field Health Products, but have not had a suitable reply. I was also surprised to receive this from Amazon as I had ordered it from a different website.Finally the costs were not fully explained as there appears to be a hidden amount of $8.62.The bill reads 2 items at 18.03 = $36.06shipping and handling = $8.19Then the subtotal is $52.87 not $44.25The $52.87 US was converted to CAD at 1.0456 and my card was charged C$55.28.So to say the least I am not satisfied"
4,Help for playing golf tell my surgery!,"This product was very useful I wore it so I could play golf tell I had my Surgery. I wore it for a couple weeks,"
2,These run SMALL !!!,"If you are new to this type of device, you must note that the size designations are not normal and Amazon should provide some guidance in selecting the size. FIRST of all, you must measure your HIP circumference and then cross-reference that to Lumiscope's ""sizes"". EVEN then, I think I'd need one size larger. No surprise - these are quite uncomfortable if improperly sized. I did not give this item the lowest rating because I think the design and construction are good - providing you can guess the correct size."
1,needs work,"I find that the velcro straps could be longer and maybe the pads should be movable,maybe using a velcro system so they can be postioned better,Also the sizing guide should be better."
1,Hernia Briefs,"These briefs run really small, I used the measurement suggested however the briefs and belting would not fit the measurements of my hips."
1,Not Very Good Truss,"None too happy with this unit which is somewhat tight like a corset and has no inserts or rigid components to increase pressure where it's neededBeing made of mostly synthetic material and extensive in size itis uncomfortable and does not 'breathe'. Much happier with the cheaper, compacter but oddly named ""Golden Crown"" model I also reviewedwhich incidentally appears to be made mostly of cotton.Cannot imagine who this unit would really suit unless your protrusionis very minor which I am warned can actually be MORE serious a condition than an obvious abdominal defect like mine.. too much information..?(But I am Not a Doctor, Blah, Blah...)You Mileage May Vary! I tried several types.Amusingly, my Amazon search for ""Truss"" also showed up the author of the book: 'Eats Shoots and Leaves' which made me laugh till my hernia came out then I bought both."
1,Totally Bad,"Seldom am I completely dissatisfied with a product, but that is the case here. This product completly fails as a hernia belt. Heres the list:1. Sizing: Many people mentioned the problem. I ordered a larger size than normal and it's still was too small.2. Support: The pads are too small and fit too low on the body; they do not provide the proper support. The pad positions are not adjustable.3. Material: Spandex and polyester; uncomfortable and hot.4. Design: One must stretch each of the elastic bands behind your back to engage the velcro. Awkward at best and could be a real problem for someone who isn't in the best of health.I could overlook some of these things, but the fact that this cheap Chinese product does not provide hernia support means that the only place for it is in the trash can."
2,"Super tight, Super uncomfortable, Super rediculous looking","I guess you can say these undies help, but only because they cut the circulation off to your pelvic region making you numb to any sensation what-so-ever.Plus they look completely rediculous!Looks, however, do not matter when it comes to relieving hernia pain.They did seem to help a little in that department, but only if you pull the straps very tightly."
2,truss,"I am an 83 year old female, I got the hernia by taking care of my husband who had Parkinsons Disease, now deceased. The truss that I got is for a male first of all, they didn't have one for a female, I guess females shouldn't get a hernia. The truss has two straps that fasten in the back ( front to back) and I can't reach that far, so I have to have someone else to fasten it for me, which doesn't work out too well when I have to go to the bathroom. It doesn't fit too well on my female body. I am at a loss to find a truss for me, I have looked online for a female and have not found one, so that's my story."
1,Mr.,"Bought one of these and it is a very poor quality product & the sizes are not accurate - suggest going with ""Fla Orthopedics"" products for a hernia support. They are very good quality, and work well without the pads.Lumiscope Support Truss, Large"
1,Didnt work for me,This product did not keep my hernia In no matter what I tried. It was the right size but just didn't work at all. I ordered this item from Amazon.
1,Size problems and falls apart,"Sizing was an issue. Couldn't find any sizing information on the order page. Sizes run small, so I ended up with one that was too small. Got a replacement that was the correct size. The waist-band is coming off with less than a week of use. I've repaired it myself, since I don't want to be without the truss waiting for yet another replacement (let alone the hassle of trying to get hold of someone and explaining, etc.). The truss does its job well, it's just falling apart."
2,Not very good,Said it was for waist size 41-46Camw hip size 42-44Could not wearWould not recamend this product to anyone at all
1,my review of the title,"This product is not worth the money. The velcro is not heavy duty, so it won't hold after awhile. The velcro patch is too small, and the belt is too short. Belt should be longer for all models,and velcro should be much wider. Quality of fabric is not great. It starts to unravel after a month. The design is sound, but leaves much to be desired in construction. Be ware."
3,Support truss,"Not quite what I was looking for but it works. Had some problems with the order with first being wrong size sent from what was ordered, second being left side support ordered and support for both sides sent. Used it and it works but is awkward. Be very careful about ordering size larger as they are tight! The jockstrap type works better."
4,Southern Californa Water,"Erie's book is an entertaining read about the history of the Metropolitan Water District and its role in serving a thirsty Southern California. In California, water and politics have always been inseparable. While Professor Erie's book may rankle some individuals, I found it to be a thoroughly researched and objective book. Certainly not dry reading, I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in California water, history, or politics."
5,About Time,"It's about time that someone got beyond the misleading notion that water is simply a morality play. The damage done to developing any rational water policy in California by Chinatown, the movie, and Reisner's Cadillac Desert has been enormous. Eire puts the quest for water for Southern California in a historical and policy-making perspective that goes beyond the literary license taken with the facts that have muddied the politics of water in our state. Unfortunately, Eire isn't interested in a good story as Robert Towne and Reisner were and his book won't get the wide reading it deserves."
4,Gorgeous.,"This is a great piece, though perhaps a tad larger than I was expecting.I was very pleased with the item overall. Thank you."
3,book,"It was for my son, it gave him some information like clipnotes, he really needed the full book to read. But it suited the purpose for what he had to do."
5,Federal Patch Collecting,"A great, hard to find guide, excellent pictures by a expert in Federal Patch collecting......A must own for collectors..."
1,"Scare Tactics Sell Books, But....","Catchy titles and scare tactics are a way to grab the attention of concerned parents, but reduce the quality of this book to the level of a poorly researched popular magazine article. There are more than enough books of this type available; what parents need are well balanced, carefully thought out, science based, and well referenced books that offer guidance and measured recommendations. Suggest that people concerned with ADDHD look elsewhere for help."
5,10 for the heart,"I think this is a very good CD...it will help children in our country who have had to grow up with out moral characters to see what is happening in our country, and to make a difference! i think that Tricia Lowenfield has done a wonderful job with this recording!"
1,Spotlight disaster,"Spotlight Collection 1 still contains cuts, there are interlacing problems on some of the cartoons, others are faded, scratched and dirty. For a collection that supposedly is restored and remastered this is just out of order. Warner Bros. exchange programme is a bad joke played on their customers. Don't waste your money on this load of rubbish!"
1,Mammy two shoes - Where are you?,"""A Mouse in the House"", 1947""Mouse Cleaning"", 1948""The Framed Cat"", 1950""Triplet Trouble"", 1952These classic's are not in collection 1 & 2 which featured Mammy two shoes (probably because they didn't want to add any more EDITED shows to this set!!!!)"
4,Terrific,"I had seen this book elsewhere before I decided to buy it, so I knew that I liked the contents, which are lives of some little known Catholic saints along with others who are better know. The author writes as though he and I were having a private conversation. He informs the reader of the inspirational lives of the saints in the book in a very personal manner. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in ""Saint watching"".The book was advertised as new and it was delivered in pristine condition."
3,This DVD is strange.,It is not exactly what we were thinking it would be. There are no verbal instructions or explanations of the beats--he just does it really slow or really fast.
2,Not for beginners!,"I bought this book as a gift for someone learning the djembe drum. This book is not for someone brand new to the drum. There is no basic instruction on how to slap, beat, or use the drum, just instruction on some various rhythms for songs. It is not useful for someone who needs to understand the various touches and sounds that can be produced on the djembe. It simply jumps into videos of hands hitting specific rhythms. This is not what was expected."
4,Pretty nice mouse,"Not as finely-precise as say, a real gaming mouse, tracking feels a bit ""last-gen"" but it seems solid and reliable. Buttons and wheel feel good. And the design looks slick, silver and black with little HP logo. Not ghetto looking like other cheap mice. For the ultra-low price, this mouse is unbeatable."
5,Must have book,"This is a must have book for all intercessors. It gives those prayer warriors the boundries that we all need. It is not, in any way, limiting but very freeing. This book gave me the ground rules for intercession. I loved it!"
4,This book could save your life!,"There's a lot of misinformation and misunderstandings out there about spiritual warfare, binding and loosing, and all that. What you don't know can kill you! The author painstakingly gives the historical biblical roots of spiritual warfare, starting with Adam and ending with Jesus. He carefully shows where the believer's authorities are and, importantly, where they are not. This level-headed look at a very hot topic today will keep you under God's covering and set you aright in your biblical responsibilities and authorities in conducting spiritual warfare. The focus is where it should be -- on God and on the role model that Jesus provides for us."
5,Worth The Read,This book has great understanding for the intercessor or those that like to take authority. It explains why you need to stay in your given place of authority and why sometimes bad things happens to Christians when they pray.
5,Good reading,"This is a typical John Paul Jackson book. If you like his reading, then you will want to add this one to your library."
1,"Awful, terrible, laughable...","If you are serious about learning dialects, do NOT buy this CD. If you think it would be fun to learn some different dialects to try and want to have a remote chance of fooling anyone, do NOT buy this CD. A high school drama student would have done a superior job. You would be better off learning dialects from the Simpsons or Saturday Night Live. This is not an exaggeration, this is a flat out warning. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't bother,This dialect monologue cd and booklet is a great idea. Unfortunately it is not all that useful. All the monologues are written by one person. The rhythms and the world of each monologue lack cultural authenticity only ever realising a general flavour at best. This is particularly so for the Uk dialects. The other big minus is that all the monologues are spoken by one actor in dialect with varying degrees of success rather than native speakers of each dialect. Again authenticity is compromised. This cd and booklet does not provide good written or spoken samples of the dialects that are contained in it for anyone to study them in any kind of depth. I returned it to Amazon as soon as I listened to a couple of tracks.
3,Just fine,"Material was a little cheap, which is normal for a costume. Did the trick for a 9-year old's Halloween costume!"
3,"Overall a good read, more like Proust than Kundera.","Well written, but too long. Still, Peter Norton covers all of the bases. And I mean *all* of the bases. The book is very well organized and cross-referenced. Hands-on applications in each chapter score big in my world. This book has that, too.I use Windows 98 with version 7 DOS and have found the book to be helpful even here. The basics as well as advanced topics are inside and even a beginning DOS acolyte can dig in and learn something.Maybe it deserves four stars, but I only reserve that for the *really* good books.Anyway, congrats for P.N. A fine job."
5,excellent,"great book, this guy knows his stuff, i wish more people would write books you can read. have been looking for a simple way to use the com dos was the solution. too bad microsoft doesnt include full version in windows anymore. wouuld like to see more on the dos command library and more detailed examples for serial communication"
5,Exellent from the Master.,"If you like seeing what makes things tick, Norton is the Author for you.If you have interest in programming but don't want to jump in with both feet, Try this first. Get this book, open Notepad (as editor), make some batch command files then decide.GREAT BOOK !! FOR ALL INTERESTED IN HIGH SPEED EXECUTION, & MORE.I FEEL THIS IS INVALUABLE TO PRO AND NOVICE ALIKE, ALSO A GREAT REFERENCE FOR FUTURE PROBLEM SOLVING. (a CLASSIC)"
2,Not enough Bang for the buck.,this patch so many have seen is actually not what is really shown. it's not enough bang for the buck because when you buy it you pay for the patch and for the shipping involved. It would have been easier to buy the patch at a studio then buy it online.
2,"It's alright, I guess...","Well, all things considered, you get what you pay for. The sword isn't accurately sized, it's actually about a third of the actual size of the real Zangetsu. As others have said before, it comes with a extremely noticeable ""Made in Pakistan"" stamp right on the side of the blade. The sword is all-in-all, poorly made. You can tell the sword is just stamped out a sheet of metal instead of actually being forged or made, and the blade is painted black, with the silver edge of the blade just being chrome paint over the black. Mine came with a pretty poor paint job, so it looks pretty bad. The sword also comes with a shoddy scabbard which falls apart extremely easily. In conclusion, if you absolutely must get it, you might as well. For $30 you get what you pay for, just don't expect anything spectacular."
4,not a toy,"my 12 year old was looking for a toy sword to play with that was from the bleach game. Instead, a real steel, sharp blade arrived. This is not for kids. The company took the item back promptly."
5,Perfect gift for a fan,I got this as a gift for my brother who is a Bleach fan. He loved the size and the professional look of this blade. He was so happy with his gift he called and thanked me twice and he NEVER calls to say thanks.
5,Made in USA--Highest quality,"That pretty much says it all. Valley Forge only offers the best. If you, like myself, has ever purchased flags not made in the U. S. and then found one made by Valley Forge the difference is astounding. These are great-indoors and out. Worth every penny."
4,Decent Cheap Purifier,"This is a decent cheap air purifier for those with very mild allergies. If you have severe allergies or asthma, do yourself a favor and make an investment in a more expensive unit. I live in a small apartment and have a Sharp Plasmacluster (excellent product) in the bedroom, so I keep this in the living room for a little extra dust removal. I cut a piece of a Honeywell charcoal pre-filter and taped it to the back of the filter to aid in odor removal. It's true that the manufacturer no longer makes replacement filters, but you can buy comparable aftermarket filters online if you look hard enough."
3,Hamilton Beach TruAir,Only good for smaller rooms. Never seems to work well for our med. sized bedroom. Use only for small office. Filter needs to be changed oftem but that could be because we were using it for larger room. If you like white noise then you will like the noise level.
3,I don't know.....,"It seems like it might be doing something, but its pretty loud considering the size of the unit if you're on medium or high. On low it seems like its probably not even doing anything. Don't think I'll purchase a second."
2,Expected more.,"I read the reviews on here and got sooo excited....I was supposed to go get my parents' cat and bring her home and keep her inside. I thought this filter was the answer to my prayers, based on the reviews here.I bought two of them yesterday from Wal-Mart ($47) and brought them home and hooked them up. I did wake up this morning with seemingly less sneezing and happily went on to get the cat. Got home with her...started wheezing. Okay, that could be reflux, or so I thought....until I started sneezing and having itchy eyes. :( Guess they didn't work for me. My husband is off to buy a real HEPA filter."
3,Price,"I have not used this unit yet, but the price on here.. the listing for 79.99 but cut to about 53.00 isnt a savings. I dont know how it is a list price of 79.99, when Hamilton Beach sells it for 39.99. You can buy their ""better"" model, True Air Glow Allergen Reducer model 04385, for 79.99 on here and from Hamilton Beach."
1,THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED!,"The Hamilton Beach 04381 has been discontinued. If you purchase this item, you will NOT be able to buy replacement filters for it."
3,Unobtrusive at low speed,"Hepa filter unit is small, easy to find room for and unobtrusive. Consumer Reports has it rated in the middle of the pack. We find it a little noisy on medium and high speed in a wood-floored, uncarpeted room. The seasonal allergy sufferer in the house is still suffering."
1,HAMILTON BEACH STOPPED MAKING REPLACEMENT FILTERS FOR THIS AIR CLEANER A YEAR AGO!,"Yes, we did very much like this air cleaner -- when it was still usable. But our 04381, and yours, was 'bricked' by its own manufacturer, Hamilton Beach, when it decided many months ago to stop making replacement filters for the 04381. Worse yet, it continues to distribute the TrueAir 04381 to wholesalers at bargain basement prices. The wholesalers supply them to retail sellers like Amazon, who are cynical enough to drop their price on the 04381 a few bucks in the hope of selling out their remaining inventory before word gets out.Shame on you, Hamilton Beach. You too, Amazon."
4,bought this for a cat!,"i bought this to help with my cat's asthma. i can't really detect anything different, but he hasn't been having as many attacks. also, it makes a nice whirring sound that is nice to go to sleep to."
1,Filter replacements no longer available,"We love our True Air, but you can no longer buy the filter replacements! Do not buy this model, they offer a newer version."
3,Didn't reduce sneezing,"We purchased this because my wife had been sneezing a lot, and she blamed it on allergies. This doesn't seem to have reduced her sneezing hardly at all, and it doesn't feel like the air is cleaner (not that I have a specific idea in mind as to what that would feel like).My best guess is that my wife's sneezing is not due to allergies, and so the TrueAir is not to blame for not solving the problem. Never the less, it _didn't_ solve the problem. Hence the mid range score.The noise is quite pleasant on low, and not so pleasant beyond that."
5,great machine,I am going to get another one of these. They work well and it helps a lot with allergies. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Glad I bought this inexpensive machine,"Works great...I smoke downstairs and live in a three story condo.I place this by the door at the top of the stairs and you can't smell smoke anywhere else in the house. Before I got it could smell it all the way to the third floor, for hours!"
4,"Great machine, but...","After purchasing one of these HEPA filter machines, I was impressed with how quiet and effective they were. After my good experience with the first machine, I purchased two more machines.The problem is that these machines do wear out. After about 1 1/2 years of use, my filter machine became noisier and less powerful. Since I use one in my bedroom, I had to swap it out with a newer, quieter machine. Even though these machines wear out, I cannot argue with the price. They are well priced for what they can do. I will purchase more machines."
5,Air Purifiers,I have a lot of allergies and asthma..the area I live in is very dusty ..I was constantly dusting..I bought 2 of these ..placed one in my bedroom and one in the living..within 2 days there was a noticable decrease in the dust on my furniture..Instead of dusting daily I am dusting twice a week..I'm am breathing and sleeping a lot better too..I am considering buying a 3rd unit for my kitchen/dining room..I am more than pleased with the performance of these units..
5,I LOVE MINE!,GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. I RECOMMEND IT FOR PET DANDER AND DUST. IT HELPS ME BREATHE BETTER AT HOME AND I'VE HAD FEWER SINUS INFECTIONS!
4,TrueAir review,Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04381 Allergen Reducer Air CleanerVery quiet. Don't even know that it is there. Meets all needs in cleaning air and quiet.
4,Pretty Good Air Cleaner Hamilton Beach Tru Air 04381,The air cleaner does a pretty good job. It's good for a large room. It does really collect the dirt just like a regular pleated filter does in your central air system. It does not have an ionizer or carbon pre-filter but you can make a carbon pre-filter and place it in front of the allergen filter. It runs 24/7 and there have been no problems. I run it on high and after a while the noise just blends in the background. When I go to sleep I put it on medium and it is quiet. On low you can't even hear it.
3,not as good as i expected,"I purchased two of these for my small apartment, after reading the reviews I thought they would help with my allergies to my girlfriends cats. Well at first I thought they were, then when we started to run the AC it seemed as if they weren't doing a thing.. we turn the AC off when we leave, and I leave the units on. When we come back it seems as if I'm walking into a cat house. I have tried repositioning them, keeping other areas closed off and nothing seems to work. I need to purchase a bigger unit. I will put one of these in the bedroom."
5,Made a big difference,"I am starting to develop allergies and was waking up every couple hours. I decided to try an air purifier, but didn't want to buy the really expesive ones in case it didn't help. I have slept very well ever since buying this one. It's definitely cleaning the air and making a big difference."
4,I am new to air purifier,"It was the first time I buy an airpurifier. It was super easy to setup/get started. I have been using it in the bedroom and I admit I did feel a change in the quality of air I breath. Is it that drastic, I would say not, but I enjoy that fact. The one good use I put it to -My wife travelled with her clothes and some spices in the bag. when she took out the spices they strongly smelled. I put the hampton in the closet for about 8 hrs and closed the closet. The clothing all smelled fresh and ""spice-free"". I was pretty happy with that.I give it 4 cuz I wasnt sure what to expect; it didnt change my life to give it 5 but no flows so far :-)"
4,Excellent air cleaner,Great air cleaner I use it in two rooms and it does a great job especially getting rid of cigarette smoke! A terrific air cleaner but it is a little noisy for the bedroom
5,My girls stopped coughing....,"My girls just coughed and coughed without apparent colds mostly at night and when the got up in the morning. At school they didn't cough hardly at all. The Dr. said he thought the one had allergies. As soon as we filtered the air in their bedroom, they both stopped coughing. The results were immediate the first night they slept in their room. This is one of the best investments we have ever made."
2,Poor,"The fan never worked well (didn't turn freely and was horribly noisy), and it conked out completely a month after the warranty expired."
5,Breath easier,"I bought this product because of a serious smoke allergy. It has helped so much. I still have trouble with the air in my home, but I can tell the difference. I would recommend this product."
4,Seems to work well for me....,I've had the air cleaner system for a few weeks now at first I didn't think it was working but as time has gone by its definitely been picking up the allergens/dust in the air. I have two dogs and knowing that someone can come in my house and not have to deal with all the fun things they bring into the house from outside is wonderful! I really enjoy the product and would recommend it to others for us.
3,Thinking about a return,"I bought this product for my 110 sq ft room that is home to my entire life including the cat's litter box, my laundry, gym clothes and dirty shoes. My room had a general stank and stuffiness to it when I came home at the end of the day that I was hoping to eliminate. Unfortunately, the filter is not a carbon filter so it is not made for eliminating odors.I'm also a severe allergy suffer and have not noticed much difference in my allergies. The unit is definitely working because the filter is full of dust and cat hair, but it certainly hasn't changed my life as an allergy sufferer.I think at this point I'll keep it because it can't be hurting (do your research on which air purifiers emit ozone!!) but I'm going to invest in a smaller unit with a carbon filter to hopefully help with the smell."
3,Quieter than expected,"I bought this unit because other reviewers said it was a good source of white noise, which is what I was looking for to help me sleep. I find it very quiet compared to my last air cleaner, so I am disappointed about that aspect of it. On the other hand, it will be good to bring on trips because it is so small and portable."
2,Not worth $10,"I saw all of the positive reviews: They are WRONG. The fan is miniscule, the filter modest, and the efficacy is almost nil.I saw absolutely no improvement in air quality. Further, I have had six other makes....all were superior to this.Also, they do not make it clear that this does absolutely nothing for odors, since there is no carbon element."
5,Still working well,"We bought this 9 months ago, still working well. We bought a 2nd one shortly after first one. Works well, filters cheaper than most other ones. Is a bit noisey (white noise), but my wife prefers that for sleeping anyway. We both smoke, so it does a good job out in our sunroom we smoke in.Well worth the money we paid for them and the filter cost.We run ours all the time, so they seem to hold up well over the long haul too."
3,Air Cleaner,It's good for a small area. I keep the unit by my stove top. It seems to get the odors out much quicker.
5,Best $50 I've spent in a long time,"I'm a smoker, who doesn't like smoking in my home. But I live in Seattle, and standing on my balcony in the 30 degree rain isn't fun, so I'm forced to smoke in one room of my house; my office. I bought one of those $350 Sharper Image doodads, and for the first month or so it did a great job, but it was not a pleasure to clean, and after a while the casing got so dirty I had to throw it out. You can't clean the casing!This little puppy is great. A fraction of the price, replaceable filters that I can throw out, a casing that washable, and my office smells clean and fresh. Not chemical ozone like the SI device. I highly recommend!"
4,Catchy!,"I just got off a Caribbean cruise. At one point, a fellow passenger was talking about a ""secret"" passageway on the ship (the ship is the ""Voyager of the Seas""--truly an amazing cruise!). Anyway, at the mention of a ""secret,"" my cousin started singing the title track from this CD/show! She said it was the funniest show she'd ever seen, and that she listens to the CD constantly. I had seen the show too, and the CD brings back happy memories each time it's played."
4,Good laughs...,"Some very good laughs, though not memorable tunes or breath taking performances. Down right fun!"
2,Disappointed,"The quality of this lamp was disappointing. The bowl of the lamp is made of what looks like cheap grade plastic. The pole section of the lamp came in three or four parts. One of those parts had a defective thread, so that the section which was supposed to be screwed on top of that one would not screw in straight or even all the way. Overall, the product felt like it was too cheaply made for the price. I returned this product and received a refund."
2,REMOTE CONTROL NON-FUNCTION,"I BOUGHT THIS LAMP PRIMARILY FOR ITS REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTION AS I WAS GOING TO PLACE IT IN A LOCATION FAR FROM THE ENTRANCE DOOR. THE REMOTE CONTROL WORKED FOR 2 DAYS AND FINALLY CONKED OUT. I DID EVERYTHING TO MAKE IT WORK - CHANGED BATTERIES, ETC. BUT NO SUCCESS.ADDESSO - I BOUGHT MANY LAMPS FROM YOU SO PLEASE IF YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ONE, PLEASE! PLEASE SEND ME A WORKING REMOTE. I THREW THE BOX ALREADY SO RETURNING IT WOULD ENTAIL MY BUYING A BOX FOR IT."
5,best knife ever,"I have had knives which dull over time or are very heavy. This knife is so light and chops so well. Everytime someone comes over and uses it, they comment on how great of a knife it is. I want to buy another one because I use it that much. Ceramic is the way to go!"
2,Didn't work for us...,"I followed the exact instruction, sprayed the product 3 times on separate days but the moles still came back right next day.Very disappointing experience, especially because other reviews are glorious.This has nothing to do with the product itself, but I would like to share my experience with Ace Hardware Outlet. I paid a hefty charge for the expedited shipping, and took more than a week to receive the product. My bad though, as so many other reviews indicated the same issue..."
4,Excelent product but...,This is a excelent product but i hace 2 complains:1. Does not work in linux2. Consume too much power for an old laptop
1,System Killer,"When trying to install the software for this device, it pretty much killed my PC. It failed halfway through installation, yet still appeared when my PC restarted. When the Belkin software did run, it would then freeze the computer. Had a Windows 2000 machine which this says it is compatible with, but obviously had some issues. Be wary!I will be requesting a refund."
2,weak,Tried to use this in garage computer with no luck. very weak and slow. Maybe use this in the same room....
4,Good product! Recommend!,Was looking for easy way to connect my son's computer to internet. I'm not computer savvy and once I got my password right for my internet connection it installed with ease.
3,"OK, slightly dissapointed","After reading reviews this and other wireless adapters, I decided to go with this one. The reviews are true enough, I installed then connected the adapter and it connected to the network. My problem is that I have had many disconnections with the internet. I usually just wait a couple of seconds and click retry and it works fine. But this'll happened many times over a sitting. It makes it hard to stay connected to AIM and surf important sites.Notebook: HP pavilion dv2000, downgraded to XP, a little over a year oldPros: Cheap (24.99), worksCons: frequent disconnections, very annoyingTo be fair, I've only used this a couple of hours, I'll update if anything changes."
1,Software freezes computer,The software that comes with this adapter caused my computer to freeze after 10-15 minutes.
1,Perfect,"I bought this so I could add my old computer to my network for my grandson. I ended up giving it to my daughter to use for her laptop.It works like a charm, and my grandson is especially thrilled that he can now take the computer into his room to use."
2,piece of crap,"my advice to you is to never buy from belkin, get linksys instead.This wireless card is a total pain. While my other wireless devices work fine with my linksys router, this belkin wireless card fails. I have to manually connect the device every single time I start my computer; sometimes the connection randomly drops on me; and for whatever reason, the wireless device malfunctions when I plug in other USB devices. What the heck? I've never seen such a crappy wireless device. DO NOT BUY! spend the extra bucks on a decent wireless G adapter."
2,1 out of 3 worked,"Of the three I've bought only one lasted more than a few months. I don't know what happens to them but they just quit working. First they quit until you unplug it and plug it back in so Windows can find it again. After a while that doesn't fix it either.The software is terrible. It quickly leaves you and your computer confused as to what is in control of the device,or rather not in control.Connectivity, when it does work, is erratic. Measures to mitigate what little interference I had was fruitless."
4,Works great but there are occasional disconnections,"After reading all the reviews on usb wireless adapters I found this one very affordable and reliable. I bought it about a month ago and no regrets so far. It's been used very frequently by bringing my old desktop (running on XP) online and didn't annoyingly fail. Sometimes we have seen the signal gets lost and come back for no reason and booted the system once or twice over the course of the use. I couldn't switch to Windows Wireless Utility which I think is a lot better (at least would keep it connected) but didn't spend much time trying yet. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product and recommend, but not highly."
5,ohhh i *like* it,"I've got a toshiba laptop where my internal wifi card failed. I'd gotten a netgear usb card that i'd been using.I'm using the Belkin now. I primarily use Linux. Ubuntu picked up the card right away. While the Netgear usb card regularly lost the connection, the Belkin is awesome! It's stable. It's *fast*. It works flawlessly in Ubuntu. Did I mention that it's fast? Pages load in a fraction of the time the Netgear loaded them.So far, it's been the best $27 I""ve spent in a while."
2,easy to use but week signal reception,"I bought this product for my desktop, which sits in a different room than my wireless router.Pros:1. easy to use. The software installation is quick and easy.2. real plug and playCons:1. little bit bulky. Can plug in USB port, but squeezy if neighboring port is used.2. week signal reception, and frequent network drop because of this. When I put my laptop side-by-side with the desktop, the signal reception of the laptop is excellent, while that of the adapter is very week.3. will not work on USB ports that are not directly wired to system. E.g. when plugged into USB ports on a keyboard, which is connected to desktop through USB, it complains not enough power.Even though the bulk design and USB port issue are overcome-able, I would recommend buying an adapter with better signal reception."
1,A useless piece of junk,"This Wireless USB can't even reach 75 feet from one Gateway XP with 512gb to another. Both computers are in excellent condition and up to date, using a Linksys wireless router. The fastest connection speed? 18kbps. Zoom zoom zoom.Do NOT waste your money on this. Get a brand name instead. I regret making this purchase and have learned a hard lesson."
2,Not very good product...,"We were excited about getting this USB wireless card for our desktop because people kept tripping over the ethernet cord. Unfortunately, the card only worked the first day it was plugged in. After that, the internet began to lag, occasionally drop it's connection, and eventually not work at all. WWEhaven't even had it a month, and we've had to return to sing the cord.I dio not recomend this poduct, and wish I'd gotten a different one to begin with."
2,GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST,hello everyone..this review is on belkin usb wifi adapter. I have used this adapter for over a month. This USB adapter is small and effective only in close ranges to the router. If the router is 40 feet far. signal gets weak and no internet. I am sick of it and a waste product if you are away from router. I cant access internet in my university as the router is somewhere....waste of money...
5,Perfect Bird Feeder Hanger,When this product arrived I was delighted. Not only was it a good price but a stylish way to hang a bird feeder outside my window so my cat can watch the birds.
4,Cool,this product shipped fast and it was easy to use and it stores very simple to. The real works great and it does not feel cheap.
4,English Translation of Chasidic teachings on the Parshah,"Being that it is rare to find an English rtransaltion of a wide variety of Chasidic masters on their teachings of the Parshah, this is a fine book,"
2,Uninspired roland tomfoolery,"Completely forgettable release that I would actually have to re-listen to in order to provide specifics. Just made no impression on me after a number of listens. Not fond of it as I'm into a number of out there things, this just didn't engage me."
4,More Spongebob!!!,"The episode ""Bubble Buddy"" makes this DVD worth owning alone. But all the episodes on this DVD will make you laugh. And it's worth owning because everytime you watch a Spongebob episode, you catch some witty thing you never realized before.The only drawback is not enough special features. This disc has more than the last 2 DVDs released, but I would like to see more ""behind the scenes"" Watching Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, and Rodger Bumpass perform the voices on the Nautical Nonsense DVD was so cool. I would like there to be more of that. I realize that they probably didn't videotape them doing every episode, but I hope they do with any new episodes they make."
5,Now we've got MermaidMan and BarnacleBoy II on DVD!,"If you like to hear the song, ""Loop De Loop"" as much as I do, it's in the episode, ""Your Shoe's Untied"" which is on this DVD. This DVD also contains the double-length episode, ""The Sponge Who Could Fly"" with another cute finale-I will make a replica of the constellation of SpongeBob in that episode by putting glow stars on the ceiling. The episodes, ""MermaidMan and BarnacleBoy II"" and ""The Chaperone"" are also in this DVD. Plus, specially marked copies of this DVD included a free copy of, ""SpongeBob SquarePants' Joke Book."" They should do more SpongeBobDVD promotions-how about some mail order promotions or a DVD available with a free plush toy?"
2,plankton,the sponge who could flyplanktonboating schoolsudsmermaidman and barnacleboy IIthe chaperonebubble buddyyour shoe's untiedpre-hibernation week
3,Lost episode should stay lost,"The lost episode should stay lost. It is long, boring and only partially animated. They should kiel-haul patchy. It is not sponge worthy. The rest of the dvd is ok."
5,Great Product,"If you want a high-quality ceramic baker, this one is great. Cakes brown well without getting too crusty, and it's deeper than other, less expensive products. Plus, it's a pleasure to use because the cherry-red color is really beautiful."
4,"Good music, Bad Video","The problem with this disc is the fact it seems to have been shot in a manner most befitting a highschool talent show; out of focus shots, shaky cameras, random zooming in and out. As well, the resolution of the shots themselves seems to suggest the the entire thing was shot on a cell phone camera. (That is, when viewed on a high def tv- perhaps your experience will be different).That being said, the music is impeccable- 3 masters, handling their instruments with much applomb. Perhaps turning off the picture and listening to it alone will do it most justice.Note: I was at the concert itself, i.e. I am visible in at least 2 shots :)."
2,the coating...,"I agree with the review about the coating, my earrings actually had the coating on the front side so unless I wear them backwards people will only see the coating and not really the rare color swarovsky crystal. Also, that rare color is really hard to coordinate with many outfits. It goes with silver and light gray, that's it. However, I have really loved all the other earrings I've order from Gem Avenue."
4,not bad...,"They didn't come out quite as sparkly as I was expecting but their understated tone actually fits me better, anyway..."
3,Not Splendid or Rare!!!,Well I don't think so!!! The write up seems a bit OTT as well as the two reviews prior to this... Nice yes - splendid - I don't think so....
2,coating,"These earrings have a coating on the back in order to reflect the light(silver/metal coating like a mirror has painted on it.)and give the sparkle. The problem is that the crystal turns and people get to see the silver coating. Doesn't matter which ear I place them in either, it eventually turns on you. I bought a pair of yellow ones and really like them. They do not have the coating on the back of the crystal.I did not return them, but I would not recommend these."
4,The Ancient Kingdoms of Peru,"A first-rate book for those traveling to Peru for the first time. Very factual and easy to read. A bit colorless, but it's a book full of information presented in a straight forward way."
4,Certainly worth buying,"One good thing about this book is that it focuses on greek mythology and only on greek mythology and it doesn't stray far from it....unlike some other books. It covers the birth of the gods, stories of the heroes....but I find the stories of the heroes to be quite incomplete. For example, the Odyssey is a long story, but in order to save some space (for the author seemed to love putting up pictures from ancient jars and pots), the story has been trimmed up in order to fit only about two thirds of the real version. But other than that, it is satisfying, and even includes a rather complicated family tree, but if you don't mind about having pictures of naked headless statues staring up at you, then it is certainly worth buying."
4,Not the one stop VB bible that you would expect,"Overall I thought the book was ok. It occassionally jumps and makes a simple subject confusing, but it does go into detail in several topics. The book is pretty good if you already have any type of programming experience, but I would not recommend it for someone who has never programmed..get a ""Dummies"" book and save Norton's for later."
2,Don't waste your money,"Unless you need work on your typing skills, find another book. The explanations of the code are inadequate to describe the underlying concepts. At many points in the book, a programming technique is introduced via the code examples with no explanation whatsoever. The chapter on linking to 'C' is so poorly written one wonders why they bothered. There are a few nuggets inside of the book, but you'll have to dig and you will need a moderate amount of experience in another language to comprehend the coding examples. Better books are available, such as the ""Using Visual Basic"" series. Serious VB developers should check out Deborah Kurata's ""Doing Objects in Visual Basic 5.0"" or anything by Dan Appleman."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!,"This book is not for beginners. I am 13 years old and just finished learnig HTML. I got bored so decided to learn VB. When I bought this book, I couldt understand everything upto chapter 1. Then I lost it. So, in short, if YOU ARE A BEGINNER TO VB, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY."
5,Excellent Step-by-Step Approach,"Wow! Finally, a book that doesn't try ""to teach"" Illustrator but instead teaches ""how to use"" Illustrator. The difference is so important. This book is a series of step-by-step exercises. You follow the author as he creates some very cool and complex graphics with Illustrator 10. So you learn hands-on. It starts simple with great introductions and gets progressively more challenging. And since the author is a great designer, you learn all his tips and tricks and techniques for using Illustrator. I teach a college class on graphic arts, and this is the only book I'm using for Illustrator. The students love the approach and they stay interested because the graphics are so interesting. Good job!"
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed in the amount of information in this book for the price. I thought that it would be more extensive than it is.
4,Night Light,"This is a very cute nightlight and I love that it has an on/off switch instead of unplugging the whole light to turn it off, it also gives off a great deal of light. The only bad part is that there are 3 different nightlights and you do not get to choose which one you want, it is just the luck of the draw. This is fine b/c I liked all 3 designs, but I was also buying one for my daughter and one for my son so I was hoping that I would not get sent two Minnie's!! However they did send 2 of the same, which happened to be the Mickey and Minnie together."
2,mickey & minnie night light,"Guess sometimes you get what you pay for. Its cute. But, doesn't stay on. The switch is defective somehow. I had to rig mine to get it to stay on. Came with a bulb so I thought that was pretty cool!"
4,mickey mouse plug in night light,"my grand daughter loves all things disney and she won't go to sleep without her minnie mouse night light. i think it's a bit too bright, but it doesn't bother her. considering the low price, this is pretty sturdy. since it won't be handled much it will probably last a long time."
2,A bit faded & NOT actually Mickey Mouse!!!,"I ordered this product under the impression I was receiving a Mickey Mouse night light. When it arrived I was confused as to why Winnie the Pooh & Pigglet were not only the design, but included in the actual name of the night light. I have a two year old and she loves Mickey Mouse! That was the whole reason I chose this night light. She is not familiar at all with Pooh though- in this case I won't go through the hassle of a return for a $5.00 item. I do think the advertising could be more straight forward as the name clearly states ""Mickey Mouse"" night light. Also the product was a bit faded and seemed worn."
2,Cheap Bulb,"The light is cute, and it was mickey mouse like I wanted. This light also got so hot that the bulb went out in an hour. This light was intended for my son's room, but wont work for that if it wont stay lit. The seller was quick though."
3,a little cheesey but cute,It does the trick of lighting but it's no quality Mickey Mouse. For the price it is fine but I held the hope it would be more than a flat picture of Mickey modeled after a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse example. I hoped it might be a small Mickey version that lit from inside.I'm using it in a guest bathroom with all sorts of specialized Mickey Mouse items. It serves the purpose but it by no means is collector quality.
3,Wish I could have picked design,"Although the Mickey night light I received is cute, I was hoping for one with Minnie Mouse. The description does say that products will vary, but the other products I ordered at the same time were Minnie Mouse so I was hoping they would pick up on the theme. But for less than $4 I guess I shouldn't expect too much. But I would rather pay a little more and get to choose which design I want."
2,story telling,I love the Mosquito however this book is about the men and missions flown and not about the airplane. I was wanting more on the airplane. Great book if you are one who likes stories about pilots. I don't. I like data on the aircraft themselves. For me it was a dissapointment.
5,I love Valeria Rossi!!!,This is a great CD. I wish more of her CDs were available on Amazon.com. She's great!
3,"1000 questions, good rationales for answers,","I studied with this book for the NCLEX and found it very helpful. The questions are separate from the answer key which prevented me from sneaking a peek when I was clueless. I would recommend this book for an overall review. If you want specific subject areas, the questions for OB, Peds, etc are spread out all over, and not concentrated in one area. GOOD LUCK FUTURE NURSES!!!!"
2,Don't advertise with CD if there isn't one!,"Although I got this book for a steal, it was advertised with the CD ROM. When it arrived, it didn't have the disk (which I need.) I contacted the seller who I thought may refund my purchase but instead, told me that I could return it. The shipping between us would have cost more than I paid for the book. The book is in decent condition but buyers of these types of books often need the CD ROM so sellers ... PLEASE advertise correctly! The listing said (Book w/CD-ROM)"
5,The best colors ever!,These pencils are the best!They are the perfect texture and they last a long time!
2,TalkItTypeIt,"This product does not seem to work well in the teaching mode. It still, after two weeks of training makes many mistakes and does not seem to understand a majority of spoken items. You have to talk extremely slowly. Would be faster to type it out.I have been so frustrated that I start typing instead and it picks up clicks as words somehow. Not recommended for the price paid."
1,Amazon's tool to select correct part was WRONG,"I used the tool provided by Amazon to make sure I ordered the proper tow hitch. I entered all the information correctly, and this is the hitch it told me to order. When I received it, it did not fit. Amazon didn't reimburse for my having to ship it back, which was very expensive given the products weight. NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
2,Books,Wasn't rhat great but it was okay I expected more chapters than I got. But it wasn't a bad book. I did like it but I had expected more chapters. I hate cliffhangers but I guess that's my fault for buying a collection. Not the whole single book.
1,Book Sucked,"Did not like the book at all and wish i never bought it, stories were stupid, don't waste your money"
5,Nice book,I have enjoyed this book. It is a very nice read. My book came on time and in the perfect condition. I highly recommend it.
2,Damp,"Sorry, a little disappointed. I would have called this book ""Damp"" or ""Moist"" or ""AllMost"" or ""AllMoist"" ....but not ""Wet"". Close but no cigar..."
4,Soaking wet,"Loved it! What a turn-on. Another great new book is ""The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort"" by Erica Black."
3,Vintage Mirror,"The mirror came packaged very well but there were still a few scraped and injuries. I still kept it, just hope it doesnt get worse."
5,This CD makes you homesick for Hawaii.,A beautiful collection of local songs that reminds you of Hawaii (especially if you were raised there). Mellow and relaxing.
3,"""Signature?"" pffffffffffffffffttttt","Fits well, and provided just enough velcro to secure it to dash, although you had to be sparing with it and very strategic where to apply. It claims to be suede-like, but it truly appears more fabric than anything. I was expecting more from their ""Signature Series."" I didn't like the vent cut outs didn't have a finished edge, it was just punched out."
1,Swerve blows clown shoes,These suckers blow so hard. They performed at our high school and everybody was throwing their CD's/T-shirts back to them. They are clown shoes. All they ever had going for them was their big green bus.
2,Mediocre,"I bought this package at the Cingular store. I've never used a Bluetooth accessory before now. I don't particularly like it because the part that sets inside your ear is too far up on the headset itself and I can't put the earhook over my ear and have the actual earpiece in my ear at the same time. It;'s very uncomfortable to me but I got the headset, charger and car charger in a box set all for under $100. Not too bad, but the audio quality isn't that great either. I will keep looking to see if I can find a headset that doesn't require the earhook to stay in place."
1,This is a hanky of a mat!,I have a 36 x 36 shower. This little mat would require you to stand on one foot at a time. Auful. Pass it by!
2,does not hold a candle to their previous work,"I'm as big a fan as it gets ...Voivod tattoo on my leg, have all the promo singles , seen em since '91 live, etc etc. I can't BELIEVE people give this cd 6 stars. This is the worst album by them save for the self titled one in '00. It's really simple: they abandoned the Korgull story line in the lyrics and also tried a new direction musically which the knock out blow of both those heavyweights combined was too much for the old school fans to bear. Notice the departure of Blacky the bassist around this time. He had the right idea."
4,Quirky And At Times Dissonant But Still Good,"This band is quite unique. In almost every song, they come up with a catchy melody or chorus only to devolve into something dissonant with a hard to follow melody or something that goes off into lala land. I don't know how else to describe several of their songs, especially on the first half of the album. I can still hear several of those choruses and melodies now, but when I try to put together the rest of the song, I lose them because they fall apart.Though that could be taken as a sign of bad songwriting, I take it as daring to be unique and different and going their own way. They actually make it sound okay instead of bad. I guess it works this time. Overall, as the last notes of None Of The Above died away, I had a smile on my face. Can't beat that. Not my favorite band, but not bad either. Recommended."
1,What to expect,"I am dispointed that most content of this book is not challenge enough for my sons, one kindergartener and one second grader. It could be better off for pre-schoolers."
1,don't waste your money...,"I am very disappointed in this book. First of all, many of the activities are way too easy for a kindergartener, let alone kids at first, second or even 3 grades. There are some activities that seems to be more difficult but I wouldn't call those ""logic"" activities at all. The content is poorly done. I have a very capable 5 years old child and I have been shopping and buying a lot of the logic or critical thinking workbooks for my child over the years, so I know what is good and what is bad. There are many good critical thinking (logic) workbooks on the market (try criticalthinking.com) and this is hardly one of them. I returned it the next day!"
2,Plot wanders far and wide,"Although the four characters sort of come together briefly at points, there is much bouncing back and forth between their stories and it has way too many details and asides. A very challenging book. And it's pretty crude. I did like the story about the old ugly woman who could turn herself into a cat and a beautiful woman, but that was one short chapter."
1,Crude and vulgar,"So dissappointed. The reason I got this book was because I read Craig Ferguson's ""America On Purpose"" which I absolutely loved. I became a big fan of Craig's.I couldn't wait to get this book because I loved his humor. Well, I couldn't even get very far into ""Between the Bridge and the River"" because it lacked any kind of cohesion and most of all, I could not get past the crudeness and vulgar humor.....or what he calls humor. Where did that come from and why? What a waste of money."
3,Masturbating Ferguson,"Ferguson's weak and annoying attempts at being clever grate. The turn of a phrase fine, but go somewhere with it and stop congratulating yourself on your attempts at wit. If you want real wit, wisdom and cutting-edge character insight, buy Irving Welsh - whom Ferguson is obviously trying to emulate. Nice try."
1,Drudgery,Bakewoman has already said almost everything I wish to say. Reading this book is your punishment for buying it. I also chose to toss it out rather than continue abusing myself.
1,Never Received,"I have never received this item. I accidentally deleted the email confirming my order and have not been able to respond.Please either credit my card or get in touch with the seller.Thanks,Kathy FordSpring Valley, CA"
1,Don't need more White bashing,"Heard his interview with Terri Gross on NPR. She read an excerpt which was probably a paragraph. In that one paragraph, there were several disparaging remarks made about Whites - more or less painting Whites as somewhere between stupid or evil. We get enough of that these days for free - I see no reason to pay for it. I like Craig, or I thought I did....."
4,Fantastic and Entertaining,"His three stories weave together inch by inch, creating a head spinning commentary on religion in America (and elsewhere) that is increasingly addictive as you continue to read.My favorite story line was of George and Claudette, unlikely lovers who break all the rules, including those generally mandated from above, with description and dilogue that makes you feel amorous yourself!"
3,Reminds me of Ferguson's tangential monologues,"America on purpose was quite linear book and it taught me something about Craig Ferguson. This book tells more about his mind works, which is to say oddly. He gives a great deal of time to character development so you really know these people at the end of the book. The trouble I had was the bouncing around, it's like watching a Quinton Terentino film. Though toward the end you can recognize when and why we would cut from one group of characters to the other it still made for a difficult read.On the whole the book does cause one to look at organized religion and its flaws and our place in it. I have no answers for any here as a person's relationship with God is exactly that, their relationship."
5,Wonderful!,I purchased this book and it came to my house quickly and in the same shape it was advertised. I would definitely buy from them again. :)
2,F-Bomb Alert!,"F-bomb alert! Rated R.If you're offended by the fluid use of profanity and stories that frequently refer to the male and female tenders and the usage thereof, this work of interconnected short anecdotes is not for you. I can usually get through the occasional offensive word and situation in order to appreciate the creative art and value of the story, but I found the liberal use of f-bombs distracting and I couldn't get past more than 50 pages.The stories I did get through were amusing and written with Craig's wit, (I am a fan of his late night show), and seemed like they could've been biographical in some nature, perhaps written about people he knew, if not about himself. It's too bad I couldn't make it through, because a PG version could've been just as amusing, but I'll never know."
5,Surprisingly good,"I'm not a huge Craig Ferguson fan (I prefer Conan O'Brien's brand of late night fun), but I have to admit, this novel is outstanding. It is witty, incisive and worldly wise. Ferguson does what many novelists find difficult -- he combines humor with insight to give us a layered and satisfying novel about love and loss, corruption and faith. You will laugh out loud and gain a further appreciation for Ferguson's intelligence along the way. A must read."
5,Suprisingly Good Book,"I bought the book because I love his Late Late Night Show, but was wonderfully thrilled with his writing. The plot was exciting and moved along at a rapid pace, with participants gradualy more and more defined and unpredictably connected. It held my interest throughout, especially once I got the diverse charcters and their relationships straightened out. It was hard to put down. The people were amazing and easy to identify with, as I've had a pretty bizarre life too. The realistic language and actions at times were hilarious. Hopefully there will be more books like this by Mr Ferguson."
4,You love him or you don't,I'm quite impressed with the knowledge and the finesse of his experience and vocabulary. Entertaining read. He's quirky and I love him.
1,Very Disappointing,"I enjoy Mr Fergusons humor and had high hopes when I began this book. In the end, the book was far too long with some funny parts, but not worth the time it took to read.The story revolves around a number of characters whose experiences rarely intersect. Mr Ferguson's writing is riddled with asides that give character backgrounds to the most minor of players. While reading, I hoped they would somehow all come together to affect each other in the end. I was very disappointed in how it actually concluded. I think that if it had not been authored by a celebrity this book would not have been published."
5,Read It Slowly To Savor It,"Wow.Most of us have figured out by now that this guy is a great talk show host, but who knew it was the thing he's second best at?This is one of those books that you have to read slowly because (A) you don't want to miss anything and (B) you don't want it to end. Masterfully intertwined storylines make you think about not only the characters he's created but the things they represent and the issues they struggle with. Philosophy meets irony meets a dark and complex sense of humor, and we get to go along for the ride.This is a great book. A truly great book."
3,Craigs Fantasy Book,"Too confusing, although interesting and well written, due to the great ""Ferguson"" imagination, BUT sometimes hard to follow, as each chapter delves on something new and loses cohesiveness. I had to force myself to continue reading it just because I wanted to finish it and yet have put the book down weeks ago before reading the last 2 chapters. Good book for doctors in psychology to read."
4,Pump works great,"After looking up the pump on the whirlpool site I came to Amazon and found it for 12 dollars compared to the 30 that whirlpool wanted. I bought 2 because in some of the reviews people said the pump only lasted a few months. So far the pump has been fine and they are easy to replace, so if in a few months I have to do it again I have a spare at the ready, and if I don't replace it, well then I have a spare. Still got it cheaper than through whirlpool though."
4,Wash machine repair,The part was as advertised. It was relatively to install and fixed the problem of the leak in the wash machine.
2,mis represented,I returned the pumps after I recieved them and they were not by Whirlpool as stated .I recieved them in very short time and all would have been great if they were by whirlpool as advertised.They looked cheap and low quality.
3,it leaked at first,when it leaked at first i thought my rough install damaged it. Took awhile for it to stop leaking.There is none OEM one sold on here with reported better seal design.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the second time I've ordered this pump and replaced in my washer within a couple of months. The second one blew a month after it was installed. I had to get a new one from the manufacturer and pay the full price. Glad I did, it's still going without any problems."
5,Good product,I was impressed with the speed and efficiency of the seller. The pump installed easily and fit like the original. I have been using it for a moth and have found no issues. Good Job
5,Great fix,My washing machine wasn't draining properly and a quick internet search led me to look at this part. Turns out one of little girl's baby socks had gotten sucked up in it. (Let that be a lesson for those with small kids. put their socks in a mesh bag first to wash). The sock was in this thing and it had cracked which cause the washer not to drain and also leak.This fixed me right up and saved me lots of $$$$$ by doing it myself.
5,Great value!,"Great price, shippping, & product! Best price on product needed. Immediate shipment. Working perfectly! Will use again if parts needed for same type item."
5,"Water leaking from this part, replaced and worked like a jiff","Have a Ultimate Care II, Whirlpool. Took me maybe an hour to install, including the initial pull apart. Undid the fastenings and rotated the outer shell down. Found the leak from the front of the washer emanating from this piece and ordered it from Amazon directly (with prime 2 day). Being the first washer repair I'd done, this site was quite helpful for my washer: [...] . Good stuff out there on YouTube as well. Good luck to all."
4,perfect fit,"product was as described. Perfect fit. if you have any mechanical skills at all, you can change this part in about 15 minutes!"
5,Perfect Fit!,"It fit perfectly where the original pump went, no hassle or modifications!Bought two to have an extra just in case."
4,very good item,Worked fine. It was as described and shipping was normal.I installed it quickly. So far it is working very nicely without any problems.
2,It mainly about Security Risk issues,"As an example, in the chapter on IT Risks and Controls, the only discussion of data integrity is buried in a few lines in a section entitled Security Risk. The examples in the book are mainly about Security issues. Take the subject of data integrity on file transfers. I believe the only mention of the subject outside of Security concerns is a Figure on the OSI Model (Transport layer alone won't detect if a mixture of old and new files are erroneously transfered to downstreams). There is no mention of detection/recovery of skipping/double-posting transactions, error thresholds, data base consistency on no-posts, restart/retry logic, checking for count and amount mismatches, balancing using checkpoints, etc. An auditor I believe should be aware of these types of issues concerning data integrity even in a core concept book."
5,E3 Improves Performance,Finally tried the E3 plugs after reading lots of reviews good and bad. Price came down so sprung for a set for my truck. Works great. Truck runs smoother. Running mileage test now.Overall good product.
1,POOR QUALITY!,"I had them put in my Buick after reading reviews on Amazon that the MPG was great. My old plugs were extremely bad, some with no electrode. I'm not getting great MPG, only average, but of course better than the worn out plugs. Have a 3100 GM motor and am getting 24 MPG average (driving to work) and that is only average for this car. After seeing some other reviews elsewhere of the cheap electrodes falling off in the engine and they are made in China, I really regret having bought them. If they were made in Japan I believe the quality would have been much better-maybe a higher price, but someone is making a killing on these crappy spark plugs. They supposedly have a better design, just not the quality. I will probably buy some NGK spark plugs and replace them, I just do not feel good about the possibility of the electrode falling off on top of the piston-may end up in the rings and then major problems!! Big waste of my money and time.HHH"
2,"Its ok, but not great","The stainless steel was quite tarnished so i returned it. I had a look at them at macy's too, most of them were that way. Even if it was nice and shiny I don't think id buy it. I ended up going with a nice tommy hilfiger one for $20 on special from macys."
4,Solid Product,I have had this product for about two years now and I have no complaints. Well designed and works exactly as I thought it would. I have not noticed any tarnish as others have said.
5,BUY IT ITS WELL WORTH MORE.,JUST LIKE I SAID BUY IT VERY RARE NEVER MIND THE ONE STAR REVIEW THAT REVIEW IS ABOUT AMAZON. SIX STARS
1,Apparently Amazon does not carry this item. Order from someone else !,"Delay delay delay. Ordered on January 24, as of June 21 still have not received it. WHY DOES AMAZON ADVERTISE MERCHANDISE IT DOES NOT CARRY? I have canceled my order, this is just ridiculous."
5,RollerCoaster Computer Game,"I bought this item for my son who is 13 years old. I am very pleased with this product. Not only has he spent hours enjoying himself, but he is learning common sense business practices. He has to calculate how he spends his available funds and how long before he sees a return on each ride. He also enjoys riding the coaster through virtual imagery. I was impressed that this game is so involved. I highly recommend it for kids of all ages."
5,Rollercoaster 3 Makes A Splash!,"Woohoo! Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 was a very goood game! An excellent upgrade from RCT1 and 2, this game included the ability to ride the ride and create fireworks, which was awesome! Also, the game looked much more real and gives you the ability to build more complex and creative rides. Plus, you can create ""peeps"" the RCT3 word for your fair-goers. I had fun with this game and creating new and different rides. Also, it was hysterical to create ""peeps"" in resemblance to people and watch they do. You can also have a park when you have to bend your back over to create a park special to a VIP peep, who's anyone from the president to a baseball slugger. This game was defintely the best of all the RCT games."
2,Poor poor and poor!!,Quality is awful! Don't waste your money this is an old game and can't keep up with the new computer technology wish I could get my money back!! Just awful!!
5,Roller Coaster Tycoon 3,"I little difficult to get used to the controls... however the game's tutorials are very helpful (they just take forever to get through). Once you get the hang of it, it's AWESOME! You can do so much with the ride building and park themes. My husband will spend hours on this game, he loves using his creativity to make awesome amusement parks :)"
4,sweet,"i don't spend much time on it but when i do, i thoroughly enjoy all the new options up from rct 2 (and 1 even).its not hard to adjust to after the old ones, just takes a few minutes of clicking around and playin around"
1,Waste of money!!!!,"My mom got this game and the soaked expansion pack for me and my brother for the summer. We were so excited to play it! The next day we started to install it into our Windows XP. It is a very good computer and since we had no problems installing other games we expected no probs with this one. We were dead wrong. After installing it, we saw all these cool screen shots and we got even more excited to play the game. When the play window popped up, tingles went up my spine and we eagerly clicked it. While we thought it was loading up, after a little bit a window popped up saying some error or something. Anyways, we dicided to click continue. Still no luck. We tried again and again and uninstalling and re-installing the game. Then we looked at the video card it needed and we found out it cost from 50 to $300!!!! WHAT A RIP OFF!!! Buy another game such as Zoo Tycoon 2. That is a far better game and has no complications."
3,Joyce,This one is very disappointing. Some of the scenerios get stuck and do not run.A waste of my money.
1,THIS GAME SUCKS,WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!!.............NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST TWO. WHOEVER DESIGNED THIS GAME SHOULD BE FIRED!!! 1 STAR IS TOO GOOD FOR THIS CRAP!!!!!!!
3,too darn confusing,"i dunno maybe i suck at simulation.never tried any of those games.well first of all u are given me so many options and so many keys to select that its hard enough to remember to what was were.though they have massive in-built tutorial and that made it a bit easier.but still i don't think that hard games should get 5 stars,just coz they are difficult"
1,Beware of Your Computer's Video Card,"I'd love to review this product but we haven't been able to play it. Evidently, although we have Windows XP we do not have a video card that will enable the product to work. Of course, I thought that if the product says it can be run on Windows XP that was all I had to worry about. I'm not a techie and I didn't know anything about video cards. Now I know and I'm $20 in the hole until I spend at least $50 upgrading my video card. Beware!Update: Amazon refunded all of my money for this product when I returned it and explained about the video card problem."
3,"good, but dissapointed","The system requirements for the game are much higher then I think most of the people who play this game have. My computer is good, but it crashes my system all the time. I feel they spent way too much on graphics and the ride cam, and left the old spirit of the game out. Still fun to play though, and the new shops and rides are nice. I really enjoy the sandbox mode to create without restrictions."
2,It doesn't work on my computer,"Ignore the 2 stars markings above, I never actually played the game.This is one game that may actually be worth buying the 3 dollar warranty for. Unless you have a recent, extremely fast windows It probably won't work.In short: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS!!!"
1,What a rip-off...won't work with a computer older than 1 yr,"There is no way to tell if this product is compatible with your graphics card. The software installs in about 30 minutes...and then you get an error that it will not work with your graphics card. We had the required equipment and it still did not run! We were not alone...many friends had the same experience. No one will refund or take back the software...STAY WITH RCT2!!!We downloaded latest graphics drivers, DirectX and still no better....I want my money back"
4,Great. Needs some things too.,"here are some things that mean you've played too much RCT3.1. You wish you brought your brolly and it's not raining2. You are humming ""Rock Like A Dude"" all the time3. You want to visit Kara Oki"
4,Great but needs some things...,"Great.... but not perfect1. One of the scenarios kept saying peeps couldn't get to the rides when they COULD2. If you keep your park alone, peeps will hate it (Ex. park is messy, staff is lazy, rides break down)The good things are...1. You can MAKE a scenario.2. Sandbox Mode is awesome.3. When peeps are bad you can make them drown.Weird things are...1. Staff can quit without being fired2. The peeps say ""Ouch, that smarts!""3. Shops break down4. Peeps can escape from holes without water5. Staff can say ""Wish I'd brought my brolly!"" if it's raining"
3,"It's okay, I guess.","It's defenitaly a good game, but to those who have played RCT 1 & 2, I warn you, this is very different."
2,Bring back the old,"I was very anxious to play this game, since I had been quite enveloped in roller coaster tycoons 1 and 2. However, the game is now made by a different company and that company has taken the wrong approach to it. Atari has made the game 3D with lots of confusing controls and features. The game takes away from the actual building of the park and instead tries to make it more like a video game. For those of you looking for an update on RCT 1 and 2, this is not for you. This may, however, be good for first-timers, but I would recommend getting RCT 2 at a good price."
3,"Big game, Big problems.","You gotta have a mega-machine for this game. My Windows 98 computer met all the system requirements. (It clearly stated it was compatible for Windows 98.) I installed on a dell computer that was massivly powerful. Ahhhhh, a taste of the game. The coaster cam is pretty awesome. The fireworks mixmaster is fun, but is a pain in the butt. First of all, you have to click on a dang fireworks base for every dang fireworks. The peep designer is the worst! You have no resemblance of a real person no matter what you do! I had been playing for a while, something weird had happened. My game was getting very choppy, choppier by the second. This brand new system wouldn't work. Ha! This is possibly the worst game I think I've ever played in my whole entire life!"
5,With the Right Video Card & Memory THIS IS THE BOMB!,"I have been a Roller Coaster Tycoon fan since the beginning, so I was excited to hear that the 3rd was coming out. I did not purchase it in the beginning, because of the reviews I saw. However, as long as you have a 3D video card with at least 64MB and at least 256MB RAM this is the best. I absolutely love this game and it is much better than the previous 2. Download the patch from the website and you will get even more of your favorite features. If you have the video card and the RAM, buy it!"
3,Average,"I am ahuge fan of Rollercozster Tycoon. I had all the expansion packs for Rct and rct 2. IT is a great game. When I played Rollercoaster tycoon 3, I was a bit disappointed. The format is completely different from 1 and 2, making previous experience essentially useless. The 3-d graphics, well, they're good but I don't think they're outstanding. They made the gane completely different, and took away the ""charm"" from 1 an 2. My suggestion is get ROllercoaster Tycoon 2 triple thrill pack. It costs less, and uses much less room in your computer."
2,This is Not Progress,"I suppose the graphics are better, the game is more complicated, and it certainly takes up more room on the hard drive, but this game does not hold a candle to RCT 2, a far more playable, intuitive, and enjoyable game."
4,Very different from RC-2 but riding the rides is GREAT!,"Yes, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 looks VERY different from the first and second versions of the game. Others have addressed some of these major differences and I echo these sentiments.What I will add: If you are sensitive or suffer from motion sickness, be careful when ""riding"" a ride. I literally became quite ill with a migraine! I will say, however, my children LOVED this aspect of the game and can easily spend hours doing so.The peeps can be a little disappointing. They wander around and get lost easily unless you have very SIMPLE paths. I also agree that sandbox is the way to go.But this game is about building rides and the ability to do so in this is a fantastic feature. I think it is a little more challenging and not being able to make tunnels is a little disappointing but making some out of this world roller coasters will make it worth everything for some people.I also have never had any problems running this on my system."
2,PATCH ME PLEASE!!!!!!!,"This game wants to be great. The patch finally came out and it runs pretty good now. One more new patch and all the issues should be resolved. Go buy this one now. If you enjoyed RC 1&2, this one's gonna make you wet your pants."
3,"Fun, but be prepared to save.","RCT 3 is the first Tycoon game I've played. That said, I enjoyed the challenge of strategizing and then orchestrating a park. If you've got the time and patience to think through a park using every inch of space effectively, you can build a huge, entertaining park.The biggest draw back is glitches in the system. My game started cutting out and kicking me out every 20-40 minutes. SO SAVE OFTEN. While fun, it can be really, really frustrating to keep losing your work. This is especially true because even if you go back and rebuild the same things in the same order, you get different feedback, and it takes a long time.Thus, fun if you have patience and save a lot. If you're not one to put up with finicky games, don't bother."
5,Great Game,"This game is great i would really like an expansion pack the levels are somewhat chalenging and is a great game if you like the sim games or enjoy games where you build stuff the coastercam is great and it has awsome graphics i kinda wish it could use ipod/ itune software as the player as it is really annoying to have to put it on two music programs this is a really fun game and it has more options and more capabilitys, just make sure you have TONS of space on your computer for sandbox games and fireworks shows!"
3,A welcome addition,"My son has used the original version of the game for some time. He is now using this version to the latest upgrade and so far, he likes it."
4,A good game,this game is good but it takes some time for it to get fun but other wise it good the grafics are better but if you want a game that you know how to play instantly this isnt the game for you
2,Only Good in the advertisments!,"There are way better games out there than this one. If you're looking for a game where you don't have to keep up the park rating, or manage you're annoying staff, then here are some other games you may be interested in:1. No Limits Rollercoaster Simulator2. Ultimate Ride SimulatorIn these games, you don't have to worry about funds, or anything. Just simply building and riding roller coasters. This game looks really good in the previews, but don't buy it unless you can really like riding roller coasters."
2,HUGE disappointment,"I hate this game. I am 22 years old. I asked for this game for Christmas because I had the first 2 RCT's and I LOVED THEM. This one SUCKS. If I had played it before I asked for it, I would've NEVER asked for it. It's so much different than the other 2. Its not user friendly. It takes FOREVER to load ( I have a new comp so that isn't the prob ) and it slows your computer down if you play it for too long. The objectives suck compared to the other 2 RCT's. I think the major problem was that the strayed too much from what made it so much fun in the first place: ORIGINALITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you haven't played the 1st 2 you MIGHT like this one, if you have, then don't waste your money!"
1,Very frustrating!,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer who said the interface is annoying. Yes, the graphics are nice, but this game isn't nearly as much fun as previous versions. Everything requires multiple clicks, scrolling, etc. I found the whole experience VERY tedious and no fun at all.I didn't experience any major bugs except that the fireworks displays didn't start automatically. I finally gave up and deleted them from the park. There could be something I failed to set properly, but it takes a ridiculous amount of time to figure what the heck the cartoonish buttons mean.Don't waste your money if you are a RTC fanatic. You'll be disappointed for sure."
2,Disappointment,"I am a 30 something mom and play all the Sims and RollerCoaster games for years. Yes I even play TSO! I am HOLLIDAY in AV, TC and DC.I was HIGHLY disappointed in Atari's version of RCT3. It's a shame that it wasn't done by Chris Sawyer and that his company gave the rights away to have someone else destroy his legacy of RCT.I gave it a 2 for the Fireworks and Onboard Camera which the effects are really cool. Unfortunately, those are the only 2 highlights.When I first opened the box, I knew I was in trouble since the game is only 1 CD...Sims2 is 4! This is nothing like Sims2 but they were hoping with the 3-D effects.Maybe it's just me and I am used to the other RCT versions but this one is tough to make a smooth transition of building and playing your RCT empire.Save your money and wait for it to fall in price. Forty is too much to pay."
3,repetitive game,"This game is ok, get really repetitive after a while not much more to the game then doing the same thing each level. I thought this one came with all three game the water and zoo one but it just roller coaster tycoon 3 so it ok it you dont mind doing the same thing"
3,Great game if your computer can handle it.,"This game is alot of fun. However I found that getting it to work properly with my system caused me alot of trouble. I am an advanced computer user, with a system that I built specifically for gaming. This system is not connected to the Internet, which led to alot of my heartache. Also, although I had a top of the line video card that could run all of my other games. I had to purchase another card and install it, so that this game would stop crashing my system. I love the game, but could have lived without the hassle that came with installing it."
4,"The demo, a preview of what's to come.","I've played the demo level, and despite some MAJOR graphical glitches, it was amazingly fun, and increadibly well layed-out, the engin is wonderful, and now you can go and ride the coasters you've built instead of just watching it from above. RCT3 has everything in the first two games, plus 3D graphics (of course), a million new features, a [rear-end]-load of new roller coaseter types and a new and improved GUI."
4,New,"They game showed up at my house almost as it had come out of the factory that day, new and well packaged."
3,Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 & Addon,"I didn't like it as much as the previous 2 games of this genru. The graphics are great, but the micromanagement is a bit overwhelming. With the addon, you are very limited with using water in rides, as you have to have a swimming pool to enter and exit with. It is great that you can build/download others custom made rides. For the price, it is about average. Stick with the last incarnation, it was better in my opinion."
1,Too many crashes.... not the coasters !!!!,"If the coasters crashed as often as this game crashes.... no one would ever want to play it. This game has bugs and they should have worked them out before they released it. We were running it on a new computer with great graphics and sound and it still froze up after playing it for short amounts of time... sometimes less than 30 minutes. I'd stick with RCT2 until they fix all the problems with this ""NEW IMPROVED"" version of a great old game."
2,Buyer Beware!!!!!,"My son was given this as a gift from his grandmother. He has every other Rollercoaster Tycoon thing there is, but THIS one would not install. The CD code was wrong. I finally resolved this through the Atari Tech Support site. However, the tech support guy told me that the majority of the people who buy this will not have the appropriate video card. So my advice is to read the system requirements very carefully and do not assume that because you can run the others, that you'll be able to play this one. - Now that my son has it installed, he is having a good time. Hopefully it won't crash....only time will tell."
2,"looks nice, but same basic game as rt2.","don't get me wrong, if you didn't play rt2 until you were sick of it, then this is a great game. good graphics, great camera work, many of the same features that made the 2nd one sooo popular. but that is my issue with it, sure there are new coasters, and sure, it has better graphics, but at it's root, it is the exact same game. there are no new challenges. and after beating the 2nd one so many times, i was able to breeze through without being challenged at all."
2,Going back to RCT 2!,"The newest version of Roller Coaster Tycoon is a disappointment. I more than meet the system requirements, yet the game takes forever to load, if it does at all, and often stutters during play. I also have to change the screen resolution on my laptop before loading.I got this game for Christmas, and decided to give it a couple of weeks worth of play to get used to the new aspects of the game. I agree with most of the complaints in the other reviews here. It's fun to build the rides and ride them, but if I want to enjoy the creation of a thriving theme park, then I have to go back to RCT 2. I'd almost rather play the original if I had to choose between 1 and 3!"
5,amazing game,"this game was really amazing. the new coaster cam and the peeps more then make up for the numerus bugs(there are alot though).and being able to import mp3s into the game is really cool, not to mention the fireworks which is i think the most amazing part of the game. plus you can finaly import tracks from rct 1 and 2 which is really fun. but before you buy MAKE SURE YOUR COMPUTER CAN RUN THE GAME becuse it needs i relatively new video card and alot of memory. overall i highly recemend this game and was not the lest bit disapointed like some other poeple."
3,"Average, at best.","My daughter and I are big fans of the original Roller Coaster Tycoon game/expansion packs. We were so excited about this release, that we actually had it marked on our calendar! I was very impressed with the graphics and on-ride cams, however both of us liked the original Roller Coaster Tycoon better, and wish the on-ride cam feature was available for the originals, as they are much better, she is already back to playing the originals. I used to play the original RCT2 for hours, this game loses my interest quickly... the fireworks were too hard to figure out except for the demo they give you, the rides are boring after a while and the game constantly "" locks up "". So, this game is average ( 3 stars ) at best. You can buy it for the day/night sequence, animated characters, and best of all on-ride cam, but after that you will be back to the original."
1,No Fun if you arent an expert,"I been playing rolling coaster tycoon for a long time. The game is so complicated that it took me an hour to find the zoom button. It crashes which makes it even awful. This isn't easy as rct 1 or 2 , so i wouldn't recommend it for kids."
4,okay but good,"I love how cheap this game is and the fact that it is actually good is a bonus, I did have one problem and its that it takes forever to get to my place, if this game as shipped faster I would have rated 5 $t& but its not"
2,"tut, tut","when i got it i thought there would be much more options than roller coaster tycoon 2 (which i also have, along with the first one). you CAN'T build underground or make tunnels and there's ONLY 4 THEMES!!! (the previous ones had about 10 each). Riding your own ride is cool, along with the endless music possibilities (that you put on it from your MP3 player) and the enourmous fireworks. if i were you i would DEFINATELY wait a couple of months. 3 words for you: BUGS, BUGS, BUGS!!!!! IT DROVE ME CRAZY!!! AAAAAAAAAHH!!!!! still, i suppose the graphics are nice."
3,New interface every time,"In RCT 2 and RCT 3, both time the developers have changed the controls. They did include a tutorial, but for those of us who have played 1 and 2, we can't just jump in and start playing. It has nice new features, but their continuous fiddling with the controls makes it something you cant just pick up and start having fun with. It's probably worth the money, but it takes a while to learn how to do simple things, like change the camera angle."
2,Buyer Beware!! Prepare for heartache!,"Like many other rollercoaster tycoon fanatics, I was looking forward to the new version of this game. Unfortunately, my problems started as soon as I purchased the game. Upon attempting to install the game, Atari/Frontier provided an invalid cd-key. I spent over an hour typing and re-typing the cd-key that came with the game, and it actually did not work. I thought I was going crazy or blind! Unbelievable quality control--Thanks Atari. Fortunately, the good people at Target allowed me to exchange the game.I currently have the game installed and barely working. Playing the game is very frustrating because it is slow (add a couple of coasters, food stands, a few hundred people) and full of bugs. Let me say that again. The game is full of bugs and crashes alot!Do not believe the system recommendations on the box. You need to upgrade to the lastest, fastest possible machine on the market to sort of play the game. Did I mention that the game is full of bugs?"
2,"The Good, Bad, and Ugly....","The Good - Graphics look sharp, lots of extra themed items that look good, fireworks, import your own music, ride your rides.The Bad - The controls are clumsy and seem backward especially if you have play RCT1 or RCT2, lots of the scenery walls and things do not line up mesh with each other, impossible to create a ride inside of a building.The Ugly - The terrain application is HORRIBLE, no more tunnel, no more rides or paths underground, the terrain is no longer broken up in grids that can be raised and lowered, no when you do that work it pulls all of the land and looks like crap.You will be diappointed in this game if you are expecting anything like RCT1 or RCT2, dont waste your money."
4,Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 compared to Rollercoaster Tycoon 1,"I was a big fan of the original Rollercoaster Tycoon, but when I saw this, I thought that I would try it, so I got it, installed it and launched it. Right away I noticed the clean and easy to navigate interface so I immediately went to sandbox mode and the game play, especially the Coaster Cam, is much better than the original, I really recommend getting this game."
4,"Very Fun, But Has Problems","Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is a great game with great features, and it is very fun. I enjoy playing it a lot.BUT, some of the controls are hard to use, and the instruction manual doesn't help much. The staff management is annoying, but you get used to it. Also, on some computers, it is slow. You need lots of memory, horsepower, etc. Also, difficult to learn at first.Still, the game itself is fun, without the several bugs. Not suitable for very little kids.4 stars for kids 10 and up"
4,Fun Yet Limited,Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is a very fun and is enjoyable for anyone. The onlytwo down sides are that you have limitations to height and you have to buythe expansion pack Splash to have the good water rides and Wild to have zoos.But over all it's very fun.Van age 11
5,bugs but FUN!!!!!!!!,Roller Coaster Tycoon is SOOOOOOOOOO FUUUN!!!!!!!!!!!! you can build Roller Coasters and Build parks I LOVE the woodon Coaster cuz you can build it better PS if you want to no more write a coment!!! PS you can make your peeps
5,"Mommy of Teagan ""the rollercoaster nut""",My son just turned 5 and is obsessed with rollercoasters. He couldn't wait to get roller coaster tycoon 3.(he has one and two also). He definitely wasn't disappointed. He loves that the game allows you to create an amusement park as well as the people that visit the park. It is not a game for children that are not computer savy but great for older children as well. I love it because it is not just a game but encourages him to use his imagination.Thumbs up.
4,Great Game,"This game is really funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. The graphics are good.but if game is left on awhile the people and building and scenery get messed up, like the prople heads look like they are at there feet. The best thing about this game is that you can create your own people, to enjoy the park. When I'd tried to make custom charecters, befor I updated the game, it always froze. But after you update it is fine. After you update the game there are really cool new features, like making waterfalls,new rollercoasters, and new scenery items. A really good game when you get all the bugs out."
3,Not sure if I'd get this game just yet,"Well... I had bought this game, but hadn't opened it yet when I read all the reviews on here up until that point. From the looks of things, I have seen MANY complaints of games crashing, video pausing and the like. This being my dad's computer, I am not willing to take that risk until I hear that Atari has fixed these bugs and whatnot. So I gave this game 3 stars because in theory, it LOOKS and SOUNDS like a great game, based on screenshots and videos. If they could just get the game to work right, we'd be all set!I went out this morning and exchanged my unopened RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 game for RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Triple Thrill pack. I've heard THAT was worth the money."
1,Memory Gobbler !!,"Aggghhh! I can't believe my XP can't handle it. The game crashes, even with the smallest of rollercoasters built. Any more than 20 people in the park and it packs up. Forget the scenarios: They've already got too much in them for my PC to cope with. I havn't given this game a proper fun rating because I really don't have much idea how it plays yet. I havn't had much chance.Luckily, I'll be getting a top of the range PC early next year. My ones got jittery of late anyway. So, hopefully, I'll be able to give a proper review soon. I'm hopeful, since many reviwers here have got it working long enough to assess it in detail."
3,An underrated adventure story.,"Countdown, an early directorial effort by the legendary Robert Altman, is a solid little adventure story that is much better than most critics would have you believe. Top billed Robert Duvall and James Caan are astronauts preparing for a flight to the moon. They must deal with intense training, the inherent hazards of the mission and the concerns of their families. The plot is a familiar one and the attendant melodrama is old hat, yet this film, by virtue of its visual appeal and deliberate pacing, manages to build quite a head of steam before the final fadeout. Altman uses the panavision screen effectively, and the special effects are good for their time. Look for many familiar faces in the cast, including Ted Knight and Charles Aidman."
4,A pretty good under rated movie.,"I remember having a comic book based on this movie, but, I never got to see it when it was released.Its been a long wait to see this movie, but, it was worth it. If you want to see an alternate story of the race to the moon, then this is the movie for you."
2,Molasses Cookies..more like MollasASS,HI! I recently purchased a package of your molasses cookies and it made me feel like a piece of ASS
2,Soggy trip,"Shot in 1998, this is at heart an hour-long advertisement for the service and not as scenic as you might expect; it rains for most of the five-day tour. Still, for those of us with neither the money nor the time for such luxury (champagne instead of tea at 4 p.m.) a little escapism can be a good thing--and the price is right."
5,works for me,I have used this pad eye previously and it was easy to install and use. I use it as a temporary cleat on my boat and with a swivel hook use it for docking.
5,Short Sweet And To The Point,"If you know nothing about ""how"" a podcast is made get this book, even if you don't plain to be a podcaster (I do tho!?) This book will give you a really good idea as to what goes into and what it takes to make a podcast.Plus its a really easy read, and at time funny.Podcasting For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))"
4,Very helpful,I received this book in a very timely manner and it was in very good condition and bought for a fair price.
2,Not Worth it,"Although it is convenient to use, the sound is too tinny for me to enjoy. It's much better to use an iPod with a transmitter to an FM station on a standard issue boom box."
4,The BEST!,"This camcorder is wonderful, anyone who buys it will love it I'm sure. Your fingers soon become familiar to the controls.It is also a good price for its great quality. I highly reccomend this to anyone who is just starting Filming."
3,Disappointed in SAnta,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son who loves trucks, but it's smaller than I expected and the Remote conrol is attached to the truck with a wire , making less than thrilling when you're always tripping on it and tangling it up in something while following it around from two feet away. I was disappointed since this was supposed to the big big Santa gift this Xmas. My son was, too; he remarked that Santa got him a truck he didn't like. Note the measurements and the cord!"
1,Junk,"My two year old son wanted this after getting some Christmas money. It is a total waste of money and has not been touched in many months. It will go in the garbage soon. It is difficult to get out of the box, disappointing to play with, and totally falls apart just sitting in the toy box. Save your money and buy something else."
3,"More direct port, less sale pitch.","The information available in this book was good overall, and explained Nitrous setup well enough. There was a lack of in depth Direct port setups. Any information and opinion regarding the benefits of certain component designs have to be taking with caution however. Immediately following any cons of a certain component design is immediately followed by the shear ""awesomeness"" of the authors company's product.All together 3/5 due to the quality of the info available. I would NOT solely rely on this book combined with internet research alone, BUT I'd definitely pair this book with Corky Bells Maximum Boost, as well as Jeff Hatman's Nitrous Oxide Performance Handbook and general internet research."
1,Simply a treatise in self-promotion!,"This book was a waste of time, since the author writes entirely about his own products, and uses fear tactics to scare you away from other manufacturers. Stay away from books that are this one sided. A less biased view would make this book more credible."
2,"Moderately useful for beginners, too much time wasted on selling his own nitrous products","There is some moderately useful information for beginners here, but it becomes extremely tiresome reading about the purported superiority of this man's nitrous products vs. the rest of the market. Even if it were true, it's unnecessary to cram the sentiment into every paragraph. There are also some factual liberties taken in the ""turbo vs. nitrous"" section which I found to be rather curious and unnecessary..."
1,Disapointing,"This is an out of date product manual/brochure for the Wizards of Nos company. If you want more information about the Wizards of NOS company, the website is probably more up to date. If you want more information about NOS this in not the book you are looking for. Either way, avoid at all costs."
2,The Nitrous Oxide High Performance Manual,"I recently purchased & read ""The Nitrous Oxide High Performance Manual"" by this author. It is not the book that is in the picture above.I found the book to be very basic in information & slanted more towards the import market. The author is from the UK & provides very little information on systems available in the United States. His constant touting of his own systems superiority over other designs quickly becomes tiresome.If you have very little knowledge of N2O and are just beginning to educate yourself, you will probably find the book useful. If you're looking for more detailed, unbiased information, (especially for American V-8 engines) than this is not the book for you."
1,almost useless for practical application!,Almost useless for practical application! I was looking for proper jetting for my nitrous. This book talks a lot but didn't help me at all. :-(
4,I like smoke 'n lightnin'!!!,"You hear Steppenwolf these days next to Metallica and Motorhead and it's kinda hard to say their name and ""heavy metal"" in the same breath. But so what? John Kay's delivered the goods for nigh on thirty-two years now and most of it's goods worth hearing. There's a few duff tunes in this collection, especially ""Monster,"" a political anthem in 1970 that sounds awfully dated now. But ""Ride With Me,"" ""Rock Me,"" ""Jupiter Child,"" ""Snowblind Friend,"" ""Sookie Sookie"" and, but of course,""Born To Be Wild,"" The Pusher"" and ""Magic Carpet Ride"".........all there, all good, all smokin'. Good deal!"
2,RETURNED THIS FOR MY MONEY BACK,"Get a full 8 hours of laptop run time per charge? Yea right. Try more like 1.25 hours.I have an IBM Thinkpad. I have 2 IBM batteries, and they usually only last 45-60 minutes on the airplane. I usually consume a lot of energy with the programs I run, so this is not suprising. I got tired of running out of juice, on my 3 hour flights from Orlando to Austin so I decided to purchase this APC Battery.On my first flight with my newly purchased battery I went through one IBM battery and plugged my fully charged APC battery. The APC battery soon drained in about only 1.25 hours. In short, the APC battery adds about another 1.25 hours of life, that is far shorter than what the company claims. It only has slightly more power than my IBM batteries.I actually ended up returning it for my money back and bought a less expensive and smaller dimensioned Battery Geek battery pack and now I'm getting approximately 6 hours of run time per charge on my ThinkPad."
2,Don't buy this if you have a Dell D610,"I read a favorable review on this item at PC Magazine. I checked the website and saw that it was listed as compatible with the Dell Latitude 600 series. I have DEll Latitude 610 so I went ahead and bought it. The UPB80 only delivered an extra 2 hours of battery life. I called APC and got a human being on the phone who quickly figured out that the D610 does not work with the UPB80, but the D600 does. I think their website should have been a little clearer. While the product didn't meet my needs, the quality of the battery, user manual and tech support was very good.I bought the unit online from CompUSA, but returned it to a CompUSA store and they took it back and even reimbursed the shipping. I'll definitely buy from them again.I ended up buying a battery from BatteryGeek, the BG 15-21-130 and it works great. I was able to work on my computer during the entire flight back from Germany to the USA."
3,Tony Shahloub,The movie wasn't too bad. Was expecting it to be a bit more exciting. Tony Shahloub is a great actor and his wife Brooke Adams isn't to bad.
4,Easy Read,"Fletcher leads the reader through the value of keeping a writer's notebook in his easy read Breathing In, Breathing Out. He offers valuable insights, experiences and ideas as to how to begin, keep, and find inspiration for a writer's notebook. Although this book does not lay out practical applications for the classroom, it does speak easily to those who like to write."
3,simple basic reminders,"i already keep several writing journals in various locations. They all come in handy at inconvient times, driving, showering sleeping and hiking, but gratly needed in case my brain is poor at recall. Much is common sense as writers should already be noticing the world aroud them and all that detail has to offer. our writing group has selected this book to help jog our memories for the basic simple reminders that are important and those which are not. A great read for a beginning writer. Take notes along the way, don't be afraid to underline and make notes on the edge of the pages as you read. Enjoy the exercises."
3,"Breathing In, Breathing Out","Breathing In, Breathing Out was an exceptional book. For those who love to write, and who are interested in keeping a notebook of their writing, it would be wise for them to skim through it. Author Ralph Fletcher has many good things to say about writing in general. Fletcher has a very different style of writing. As the book progresses, I found it more and more enjoyable. Although I would not say that this book is a ""lively page-turner that you can't possibly put down"", it is not all that bad. If I were to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a 7."
1,Useless,This thing is useless. When fully extended it shakes uncontrollably and dos not collect cob webs as advertised. Not recommended
5,Leader of the Pack in Biz Design,"Since the very first Macintosh computer was used for desktop design, John McWade has lead the industry showing how to actually design using desktop tools. He's the best; his stuff is real world; this book is excellent as is his 1st book and very popular magazine, Before & After. A must-have for your design library."
5,a must-read for cancer patients!,"brenda's story proves that although the journey may be long and painful, not to mention scary, there is hope that a cancer diagnosis is not necessarily a death sentence.and that there can be laughter and joy along the way.as a cancer survivor, i also see a testament to choosing the most aggressive treatment available, even if it means ostomy, scars, lost body parts or months of chemo baldness and discomfort. compare brenda's outcome to the celebrity recently in the news.and these important messages are delivered in a bright, friendly, easy-to-read conversational style that keeps you glued to the book until the last page.you will laugh out loud, and you will cry. and then you will want your family and friends and every cancer patient you know to read it."
3,Overpriced and poor live recording,"If you REALLy want to get a few of the songs on this album, download them from iTunes, where you can get the partial album for a fraction of what it costs here. However, I found the live recording to not really help the band much. Having loved their ""No Cities Left"" album, I found myself wondering what ever happened to them in here.I don't know if they are just not a good live band (I have my doubts having seen an incredible video of them performing in Amsterdam in 2005), but the recording on this album is simply too poor by any standards, and most definitely not worth the price charged for the new album."
3,Pops very own version of Smile,"This notorious third Vamp album isn't a million miles away from previous offerings. One feels the reason that MCA refused to release the record, was probably due to the poor chart positions of the first two singles, predicting the album would fair the same way.To be honest, it does sound a little tired, with TV sounding like their running out of ideas, wanting to evolve the bands sound, but undecided in which direction to proceed. If they'd taken a 6-month break, they may have returned with a fresher sound (although record company pressure probably wouldn't have allowed it).It looks like Nick Sayer, the guitarist & main songwriter in the band quit the music industry completely after TV split, which is a real shame.So in conclusion, TV's first two albums ""Pop Art"" & ""Velveteen"" are outstanding, but this records fall a little short, but still a nice little record."
3,tub time,"The kids like it in the tub. Just large ,thick stickers. Costs alittle too much for what you get but I am just the adult."
1,ehh,Didint love these and my 20 month old could have cared less about them. They look cheap and well.... not very attactive.
5,Love it,The kids love these bath toys and they stick to the walls and bathtub well. And the bags are great to store other bath toys in too!
3,Work well in the tub,"These stick to the tub and tile walls perfectly, they have stayed on over 24 hours before. So they work well and they are described/pictured correctly. They only got three stars because my daughter got bored with them pretty quickly, she plays with the city ones much more."
4,great bath toy,"My graddaughter loves to play with these shapes in the tub. they are very durable, and wash well. She like how the stick yto the tub and tub wall. Lot of fun!"
3,Beach stickers,"Not really worth the money. Colors were dull. Didn't hold my 2 year old granddaughter's attention. She preferred her alphabet letter stickers to this set. Should have lots of different, colorful fish."
1,Attitude Tee,This shirt is fairly well made. The size (small)was not true-to small for my little one. The neck hole was far to small-could not even get it over her head. Consider a size up (?)
5,Well made dog tshirt,"This t-shirt is well made, and my dog just loves it! Tank is one of those picky dogs that doesn't really feel confortable dressed, but with this one, the magic just appeared! Also, you can wash it over and over, and the color doesn't change!"
2,Diluted dyed leather,"This product looked very nice when it arrived. I bought this for a friend whose son suffers from MS. The size was perfect and the compartments were great. However, after 2 months the burgundy leather fanny pack's color had worn off and what was left were white streaks throughout the outside of the pack. Not a great product."
4,"Interesting, but incomplete...wish it had been longer & more detailed","The film deals with the last day Maud's is open after being in business for 23 years. I enjoyed seeing the various patrons reminisce about their younger days at Maud's, but I wish more detail could have gone into the history behind lesbian bars, their huge impact during the repressive 1940s and 1950s, and how brave these women were to defy authority and risk arrest by patronizing these places. I would have liked this documentary to be longer, with the regulars going into more detail about how the bars affected their lives, problems they encountered, etc. It seemed people were sad but accepting about Maud's closing, indicating that social changes dictated its eventual demise."
1,The scent of this product is urine-like and unpleasant.,The gel hold is what you would expect from any similar product. But the scent of this gel is awful and you will need another product just to mask the stench from using this on your hair.
5,What I Expected,Purchased for my childrens' Tae Kwon Do uniforms. These see to be very good quality. The dry cleaner had no problem sewing them on.
1,Defectuoso,"Desafortunadamente el estuche del LP venía con un agujero, lo cual no me agradó para nada. El disco está en muy buenas condiciones, parece nuevo, pero mis dudas son con el estuche que venía con un hueco hecho con una máquina."
2,Dislike,"I really had great hopes for this book but was terribly, terribly disappointed to say the least. I found more than a few incorrect answers which only leaves me to wonder how much more is incorrect. I just cannot study from it with that in mind. What a terrible waste of money."
1,Is amazon intentionally picking movies with bad morals?,"This is not a pg movie as said, I give this an R rating for nudity I did not want to see. I see a trend with Amazon picking bad movies with prime movies that are communistic in slant."
1,Was not the correct item,This was only 1 the 19 modules on a DVD set which I was under the impression I was purchasing the entire set. They had put a sticker over the ISBN number with the advertised product's ISBN number. Should have made it clear on the ad to exactly what was being sold.
3,Smaller than origanlly thought,Its the exact game but somewhat smaller. This should entertain my brother for hours keeping him out of trouble and bordum.
4,A great find!,"If you couldn't get enough of Knust in the original Fever Tree albums, this CD is for you! Most of the songs are written by Michael and feature a lot of great guitar work. Robbie Parrish is excellent on percussion. Pat Brennan offers a brighter sound for Fever Tree and does a good job. The music is straight up rock, with a few funk rythyms here and there. The sound quality is excellent, especially when you consider the equipment used in the recording. A great mastering to CD gives the music alot of presence. The liner notes provide additional insight into Michael's experience with Fever Tree. Hats off to Shroom Productions for dusting off this gem and putting it here for us!"
2,i was disappointed.,"i was disappointed in the performance given. to me, the reunion band sounds like any typical bar band with a better than average guitarist. most of the material is new, which is fine. the two older fever tree tunes are butchered beyond recognition. but this is typical of reunion bands as they usually hack their old songs up. i guess i was expecting more heavier/atmospheric sounds like their brillant ""another time"" release. i was looking for more emphasis on keyboard. buy this with minimal expectations. better yet, get it from your local library."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"Purchased April 14, 2011. No longer working as of August 15, 2011. Would not purchase this product again from this seller. Would not recommend to friend. Buyer beware."
5,Great fuel!,This gel is the only fuel I buy. It burns nicely and there is no odor or smell from them.
5,Awesome,Product came in time as stated. Fits perfectly with my new fireplace and was a bargain buying it by the case. Will recommend and I will purchase again when needed.
5,Canned fuel,"Great product. Seems like it doesn't really last the full 3-4 hours though. Won't b urn until empty, but you can add the leftover to the next can you open."
2,Real Flame Gel Fuel,Only last for an hour an hour and a half at very best. Had we realized how many cans we would go through we would not have bought the fire pot that used this product in the first place. We bought 2 of the fire pots and therefore it takes at least 8 gels for about three hours and that is a lot of money burnt very quickly away.
3,More fumes than I remember,This purchase produced more odor and fumes than I ever remember from gel fuel before. I ended up opening windows and adding ventilation.
1,Not as before,"I have used this brand before, but this new batch that I just received gives off an odor, and the fumes burn my eyes. I see that this kind of product cannot be returned, so I guess I am stuck with it. I guess I'll have to open the windows (which defeats the purpose)to help with the fumes."
5,Sunjel Clean Burning Alcohol Gel,"Possibly the best alcohol gel on the market. Sure, all of them emit a bit of an odor. So does an artificial log. So does real firewood (though most people would agree that real wood smells good). For my tiny house that doesn't have a ""real"" fireplace, this is the closest I can get to enjoying a fire in the hearth. The warmth is minimal (I only use 2 cans at a time) but the crackling noise and leaping flames are wonderful. It instantly puts me into a cozy, relaxed mood. I've tried other gels and this one is my favorite."
2,"Burns well, but.....",Wow! Burns well but smells horrible! Anyone think of putting in a scent for this stuff? Stuff gives the entire family headaches! But it does put out lots of heat.
2,Not so odorless,"Does the job well in our ventless fireplace . They do last almost three hours and the flame does crakel and look real. However, they really dont produce heat ( not even a little) and they do have a slight alcohol chemical scent when used in a small room or with doors and windows closed."
3,Bad oder when burning,"The price was right, but the product omits a foul oder. The first night I used it we all got headaches from the smell. Unfortuatly returns are not accepted so stuck with the product. After writing review I realized you need to shake can up before use, this helps the odor problem. Not as good as others I used but not as bad as first thought."
3,Doesn't fit my firepot.,"Just be sure to measure first, as you are not allowed to return it. What a waste of money. My fault for not measuring first."
4,Pretty good fuel,"I have a fake fireplace that uses these and they work pretty well. There is sometimes some black hard stuff that accumulates and sometimes the whole can won't burn all the way, but I like the extra heat that generates from using these."
5,Gel Fuel is great,"I purchased my gel fuel fireplace two years ago. Last year, I bought a case of Sunjel (red label). This time, I bought Real Flame. Both are great. I love the crackle sounds and the ease of use. Just rip off the label, pop the top off and light. No mess, no cleanup, no gas smell. The Real Flame smells a little more alcohol-ish before you light it, but once it's lit, there's no smell at all. Great stuff."
3,No Odor?,"I had bought a gelfuel fireplace kit.I used it as the lower center of an entertainment center.Checking the reviews online,Sunjel seemed to be the better fuel.So I ordered a case of 24 cans.Right on the can It says 3 to 6 fires in a knew fireplace before the smell will go away.Didn't work.There was black soot forming on the ceramic logs and the odor from the cans was too much.For a product thats suppose to be so clean burning It was horrible.I then decided to move the logs away from the flames.It worked.As long as the flames don't contact the logs theres no odor."
1,cans leak,"Works ok, although it does have some odor that doesn't smell healthy, so I open the window which defeats the purpose to some extent. I have a gripe though. About 6 months after the manufacture date, the cans start leaking. I wrote the manufacturer and they said this is to be expected. I said ""what? that's not right, I have 2 leaky cases"" they never wrote back. I would say that's poor product, and amazingly poor customer service."
2,Nice while it lasts,"These are awesome while they last. Nice and warm, crackling, limited odor, but, they only last around 3 hours or less. NOT very economic."
5,fuel gel,Great product for the best price. We use this in our fireplace for the ambiance and to roast marshmellows. Grandkids enjoy this.
2,Not strong enough,Barely gives a flame more than 4 inches high and 2 inches wide. Lasts about 2.5 hours gives out an orange flame and occasional crackle.
3,Gotta have fire,"Granted, it's as close to a real, vented fireplace as you can get. It gets the job done for warmth. But, after a while I've had enough of the fuel odor. Don't know if they are all the same."
5,Fireplace Gel,This product was purchased to replace previous items which had been used up. The gel burns as advertised and the sound of a crackling fire are a bonus. We priced the same product from the manufacturer and the Amazon price was quite a bit lower. We are very satisfied with this product.
3,Nice product,"This is a good product just a little messy. The label on the outside of the can burns and creates a mess around the flame area. We have had other Gel Flame products and not had this problem. They do heat the room very well. Each can burns about 2 1/2 hrs, but does not burn completely."
5,Awesome company,Not only were they lowest priced but they got them to me within 4 days. Just before the cold front came through. Thanks
5,One thing to do,I'm impressed with this product. It lives up to advertised claims and makes a surprisingly realistic fire. But one more thing is necessary before lighting: remove the paper wrapping from the cans! After about an hour and a half the paper began to shrivel and smolder around the top of the can. Pieces flared up and fell into can causing unpleasant odor and ruining what was left of the gel.
3,"Nice, but small flame","These work pretty well, but the flame is very small and this stuff goes FAST, so if you like to have a fire going alot your going to spend some cash."
1,Stinko!,"Wow... We never realized there would be such a difference, but we cannot use this stuff. We have always used a different gel, Sunjel; and we are definitely going back to it.Real Flame stunk so bad that we had to open the windows... and it lingered on and on and on. We only put two in, as usual...and managed to get the labels off, too. I'm not kidding... the odor was suffocating. We're using it in our outdoor fire pit until it's gone; and I'm placing an order today for Sunjel. Sorry Real Flame."
3,Nice to impress company...not an everyday item,"These are nice to thrown in your fireplace when you have some company over to impress. They give off a decent amount of heat and they look real nice when they are burning. However, there are some downsides to them as well:- Price: these things are pretty damn pricey.- odor: they have a pretty strong chemical odor so you won't want to sit right near them.The advertised burn time is more or less accurate (2.5-3 hours.)"
4,Good Heat from a litle can!,"This is a great product! It does what it's advertised to do and works well in our gel can fire place. I gave it only 4 stars, however, because I really think the price is pretty high and I wish there was a way to make the gel smell better. When first lit, it smells like what it is, basically a can of sterno. After it gets going the smell dissapates, but it would be nice if they could make it smell a little like cinnamon, or pine, etc. It crackles like a real fire, though, and that's nice. It heats our whole living room with 2 cans. 3 cans put off a lot of heat, sometimes too much, but we try to stick to 2, because of the expense."
4,work well,We decided to go with a gel fire system instead of converting our fake fireplace into a gas one. The gel fuel lasts about 3 hours and the crackling sound adds to the realistic sense of the fire. They do tend to have a bit of an odor at the end of the can.
5,Quality product - last long,"I have tried the cheaper fuels. Real flame is the real thing. Well made, burns well & lasts long. My wife saved money on the first four or five cases. She bought the cheaper brands. This case was a name brand & a bit more in cost. She has been obviously happier with this product. Try them all but in the end you will like Real Flame Gel Fuel."
3,Way too expensive!!!,"The gel fireplace we bought holds three cans at a time and makes for a nice crackling fire. However, burning three cans at once equates to approximately $8+ (approximately $2.65 per can, not including sales tax, if applicable) for 2.5 hours of burning. When we bought the fireplace, the gel was much cheaper and having a nice fire was more affordable. We are looking for alternatives such as burning one can at a time, sometimes combined with candles, to eliminate the high cost. If the cost goes up any more, we will stop buying because it's not worth it.The cost of the gel is certainly something to consider before you buy a gel fireplace."
2,Smells!,"The smell is bad but the burning of my eyes and the fact that it turns my white fireplace black is the deciding factor that I would not buy anymore. No soot, no smell, I don't think so."
4,A nice substitute to a gas or wood fire,"Pros: Open, light, enjoyCons: At the current rate, 30x more expensive than natural gas per hour.We bought these for our gel fire place, which was $500 cheaper than a gas unit, and was up and running in an hour. They make a nice crackling sound and have a realistic looking flame. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there is a slight odor when you use them."
3,not odorless,It is supposed to be oderless yet there is a metal smell and sometimes a very strong burnt smell especially towards the end and if you don't shake the cans really really well it doesn't completely burn everything which is a waste of money.
1,CANNOT BE RETURNED via AMAZON and REAL FLAME POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,DO NOT order this product for the Restoration Hardware laguna table. When I received the shipment the instructions seemed off since it said not to pour out of the cans. The cans will not fit in my table. Come to find out I can not ship this item back because Amazon is labeling it a hazardous material. Amazon's website directs me to the manufacturer who will not help me out because I ordered via Amazon. Real Flame is telling me I need a 8 pack of bottles instead. What a mess!!
3,Real Flame fireplace gel,Cannot rate this product because I haven't needed to use it yet as the weather has been so good here in Fl. But my order was all sent as published or sooner.
2,"Does not fit Firepot with 2 3/4"" opening.","The price is not an incentive for this item!I will have to either buy the insert/cup for the firepot, or buy other containers that fit it.So, if you are looking for just gel, it is ok, but otherwise buy a different product."
2,Great Fire - Terrible Smell,"Like many others I am pleased with the fire the fuel provides, but the scent is so strong I have to open my windows to vent the chemical stench out of the house (defeating the purpose of providing heat)"
1,Save your money,"Unfortunately, this product has a strong odor that permeates throughout the house and is unusable. Amazon is great. They refunded my money in 24 hours. I would not recommend this product."
2,Odor gives me a headache,"I bought a Real Flame Log Kit and Gel. In advertisements and reviews the manufacturer claimed that it is clean burning and there is no odor, but there is actually a strong odor. Says on the can ""use only in a well ventilated area."" The odor gave me a headache and I had to open the windows. It's ironic for a fireplace. I wonder if there is a genuine clean burning alternative..."
3,Horrible odor,"I love the concept of this as it looks and feels like a real fire but the odor is terrible. I have to make sure the windows are open when I burn them and it is worse when they burn out. Kind of defeats the purppose if you have to let the cold air in to light them, or use them when it is warm enough to open the windows. Lighting 2 or 3 at a time gives the best effect and warmth, but the odor is so strong we can't stand it so we stick to one can at a time. I do like the crackling sound it makes, sounds like a real fire. Wish they could come up with something that doesn't have an odor, or scented with something."
1,Strongest Odor Fuel Ever,"The first thing I noticed was the color of this gel fuel; it is orange/red instead of the clear to which I am accustomed.The second thing I noticed was the excessive odor from the burning fuel. I normally have a bit of smell when burning three gel fuels at a time, but just one of these cans emits more smell than three of another brand.This fuel is far to strong smelling to use indoors. One lit can is uncomfortable, three will almost certainly give you a headache.I do not recommend this fuel for indoor use."
4,Manufactured almost a year ago????,"My husband and I always use the Real Flame Gel Fuel for our fireplace. However last year we ordered from another website. This year, I found a great deal on Amazon so I went ahead and ordered. The package just arrived and the date stamped on the fuel gel lid is December 2011. Upon doing research online, this get should be used within a year of the manufacturing date for best results. It is September 2012 so why is this company sending out gel that was manufactured almost a year ago? The one we ordered last year from another website with decent prices was dated October 2011 which gave us plenty of time to use. It doesn't get cold here where we live until November/December. We are still going to use it and hope it still performs well even into 2013. However, I think we will be going back to the other website to order from now on."
1,Not for the Soho Stainless Steel Hanging Fireplace: Make sure you buy the right fuel.,"Not for Soho Wall Mount Stainless Steel Fireplace. When I purchased the fireplace, Amazon showed, ""Frequently Bought Together,"" but it is the wrong fuel. Gel and liquid bio-ethanol cannot be used interchangeably. I just went to the website and downloaded the manufacturer's instructions. Can't return fuel to Amazon. Wasted $92 on product, shipping, and handling. Wish I spent the money on going to the store to buy this."
5,the greatest sci fi parody of all,"this is the only parody that could pass for a real 50's thriller. the bad reviews of the dvd are a bit harsh on the new dvd version. it is a hoot, and the extras are very cool."
3,Outdated,"Book provided a good introduction to transnational considerations and focused on the uniqueness of each country's heritage and culture, but was outdated. Treatment of FCPA risks was very understated."
2,Not a good substitute for common sense,"There are decent country references to cultural norms, yet, as I read it, I couldn't help but think that it was common sense. It may take the mystery out of international conversations, but most international-savvy business people will find this a tedious read."
5,photos are good enough to frame and I did.,I bought this book 25 years ago and the photos are unbelievable. Great art of the glam Hollywood at its height. One copy I used to remove the photos to frame them. Book is very hard to find.
3,Melveen is a true Hawaiian treasure,Been a fan on Molokai's Melveen Leed for decades. This recordingis interesting. I believe it was recorded in Tahiti where she lived for 5 years. She does a couple of songs in French on thisone. I heard she's in the recording studio doing a Jazz album and another one of Hawaiian Traditional Music.Here's an artist that is fenomenal on stage but totally unknownoutside Hawaii. This versatile performer has the stage presenceof a Hawaiian Shirley Bassey and the sophistication on a Nancy Wilson.
4,Great toaster,"Great quality toaster, great price. I think the heating element could be faster but other than that no complaints.UPDATE: 3 years old and going strong, I'm extremely happy with this toaster."
1,Not so good.,"I bought it for my nephew, so that he can find it interesting, but unfortunately we did not like it much, lot of hype. The picture quality is not so good.These guys could have added lot of cad-cam animation and made us understand better than the shaky pictures and old films.Definitely not worth buying. Please stay clear."
5,Well worth watching,"Very entertaining, even my wife watched it with me! Would love to find other DVD like this. Hours of great entertainment."
3,I WAS ROBBED(sort of)!,"I was so excited to see this album in a CD format. Unfortunately, it was not the same as the original. Firstly, the track 'Wagon Wheels' was omitted from this version. Secondly, the orginal liner notes, dating from the time of this recording(1956) have also been omitted, instead opting for a history of the band. Rather disappointed, I must say."
4,Good Album,"It's great that these tracks are available on CD. I know another reviewer is more familiar with the original release, which I am not, but think the audio remastering is good. The Dorsey's sound good and have great arrangements. I enjoyed this CD."
5,Great Story Idea!,I was very impressed with this book. It is the story of a little snowman who could not sleep and what his snow-parents do to help him. What a cute idea for a story.The illustrations are absolutely adorable; the book is very well constructed and the storyline unique and original. All in all a wonderful book that should lit up any child's eyes with reading or listening to enjoyment. I recommend this one.
2,Poorly written and soulless,"This book is poorly written. Worse, Nichols is not able to describe what events in the book mean to history in general or to Franklin Pierce in particular. I found myself frequently consulting the internet to find out what the social subtext was for events that the author describes in unnecessarily extensive, yet unhelpful detail."
2,"Poorly written, repetitive","Too bad that this is the one book out there on a very important topic. The authors repeat themselves, contradict themselves, and blow up the material--enough for a good article--into a fat book. That said, the book can be helpful. Just be prepared to skim through. You really don't need to read the same few ideas over, and over, and over, and over again."
5,Tae Kwan Do Chung Do Kwan Basic Teachniques,This DVD clearly demonstrates the fundamentals of this sport. I was impressed with the presentation and recommend it as the best I have seen.
2,Very Basic,This will only help if you have been training taekwondo for a month.Nothing your master can`t teach you.
4,Tae Kwon Do,Haven't viewed the dvd yet since I am giving it to my son for Christmas but was happy with quick delivery.
4,Great for Children,"I remember watching this video when I was first learning to count, 3 yrs old or so, and it has stayed with me ever since. Something about it is very affecting, ezpecially for small children, and it has a kind of haunting quality that stay with you for a long time.This isn't a masterpiece of children's entertainment, but it is quirky and fun, great especially for small children."
1,Sheet ripped right after being purchased.,"I love the pattern on this sheet, and it matches my son's room perfectly. However, the quality is awful! It ripped all around the sheet right after being washed for the 1st time. All we were doing is putting it on a standard crib mattress, but it still shredded. I would NOT recommend purchasing this item. Too bad, because I do love the looks of it."
1,mine ripped too!,My son's room is a sports theme and I thought this sheet would fit right in. What I didn't know is it would rip as soon as I tried putting in on a standard size crip matress. Its too small and the quality is not the best. I now use it at his daycare for his portacrib.
2,Cute but poor quality,"Although the sheet is really cute and completes the All-Stars ensemble, the quality is definitely lacking so I have to give it only 2 stars. The sheet is too tight for our standard crib mattress (especially with a mattress pad in place). The sheet ripped at 4-5 different places along the elastic band. As one reviewer wrote, perhaps hang drying is the solution (and should be done before the very FIRST use). The manufacturer was to skimpy with fabric allowances...very disappointing. Oh well, I hand stitched the rips and still use it just so the crib looks good :-)"
4,"spys yesterday, spys today!","looking at this movie reveals the reality of this world. that in every organization, corporation and government spys still and will exist forever that's how we defeat each other.spying is stealing information to undermind your opponent or competition. it's in all religion I believe. this old film displayed the example set forth."
3,"Not original, but great vocals","This is a release by more ""modern"" Duprees from recent years. Even though it's not the vintage group it's still a pretty good holiday disc!"
5,good,i have bipolar disorder. i can tell it helps me to clear my mind and listen better. mental power is good
4,'Ghetto Love',"I love tyrese's cd alter ego. the 1st cd (the slow jams) is all that. I just dont understand the negative feedback. i bought this cd in feb. and havent taken it out of the cd player in my truck yet. I listen to it everyday. Tyrese is 'ghetto' as hell but it works for him and he really puts it down on these songs. He has a beautiful voice. Now i havent listened to the rap cd yet but i never saw tyrese as a rapper anyway and to be honest i dont care to listen to it. A few of the songs could be a little bit better but im a 'die hard' lover of his voice so it does it for me. I rate this cd a 4, for the first cd alone."
1,tyrese alter ego,"I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A HIT BUT THERE IS ONLY ENOUGH HITS ON THIS TO COUNT ON ONE HAND. SO, SAD! JUST BUY THE ONES YOU LIKE CAUSE IT WILL ONLY DISAPPOINT ANY OTHER WAY!"
2,R & B is good but rap is not 2.5 stars,Tyrese is not Queen Latifah. He can't do both rapping and singing. The R & B cd is a good cd but his rap cd is horrible. He is no good at rapping. He needs to stick to singing.
3,No need to be rapper... Stay a singer,"I would have to say that I am not the biggest Tyrese fan but the brother is sexy. I really love the first CD in this double CD. The first definitely showcases his smooth R&B tone. However, when you pop in that second CD the mood gets instantly ruined. I am not sure who told him he should attempt a rap career but they LIED!!! All in all I like the CD would recommend if you appreciate R&B. I am on the fence between a 3 and 4 star rating."
5,Stick to R&B!,"Tyreese will always get 5 stars from me when it comes to singing. However, the last thing we need is another rapper out there rapping about the same thing. Tyreese has a sexy, sensual, and pleasant singing voice that's very pleasing to the ears, but with the rapping it just sounds like he's trying too hard to prove that he can rap. Then again, this review may be a little biased because I'm not used to that side of Tyreese. I just don't see him in that light, as a lyricist instead of a vocalist. I'm sorry, Tyreese will always be a singer/actor and not a rapper to me. I think that's why he made it a double disc set because he knew that everyone would just buy the R & B disc, but nobody would buy the rap disc."
4,Can't go wrong with this product,"This GPS is my first purchase and it has been great so far. I've taken it on at least one very long road trip. It knows all the small back roads and street names, which I was impressed with.Pros:Great PriceVery Detailed and clear directions you won't get lostGPS tells exactly when and where to turnEasy installation, takes less than a minuteCons:Battery Life, won't last for more than an hour (needs to be plugged in)POI's limited, (Some schools, Airports, Gas stations, Banks, some Hotels, restaurants etc.) Has a lot but more is betterProcesses really slow when too much information is loadedDoesn't tell you which routes require tolls"
3,"It Does the Job, But.......","A friend owns this model and I had the opportunity to see it in operation. I was impressed. I researched other models with the 4.3 inch screen, and thought them reasonably similar. When I saw the great price, I couldnt resist. My only criticisms are that there appears to be no ability to swap US maps for Europe maps, and more importantly that the US maps are out of date. They claim to be from 2006, but that probably means much data was updated prior to 2005. As a result, for instance, a recent trip found us getting off the express lanes on I271 near Cleveland as directed, only to follow the express lanes in the ""local"" lanes for the next 20 or so miles! A map update is promied for ""early 2008"", but it hasn't appeared as of May."
5,jth,Worked great from the onset of use. Would be better if it had an instruction booklet with it instead of having only CD rom for learning about the use and features. Would purchase again.
4,"So Far, So Good","I've only had the Megellan 4000 GPS for about 6 weeks & so far, it's been pretty acurate.My only concern with the Megellan 4000 is that it will sometimes guide you down side streets to get you to your destination. Maybe it's giving me the shortest distance. But with all of the stop signs located on side streets, it's a little time consuming. Other than that, I am quite satisfied with my purchase."
4,Useful little gadget,"I bought this GPS mainly because of the larger screen this model provides compared to the other ones. Using the gadget and maneuvering between the menus are quite simple - nothing too complicated. I like how they have a trip planner (to save destinations and use them later) and there are countless destinations as POIs also. However, the biggest bother for me was when I noticed that upon start up, it took a while to realize where I was exactly and re-calculate position and route to take.Pros:-easy to use menus-lots of POI's (although they may need to be updated)-trip planner to save multiple destinations-price for the modelCons:-took a while to locate position upon start up (up to 30 secs at times)-does not have text-to-speech capability-sometimes takes less popular roads, even though I'd prefer themAll in all, I get what I paid for. It comes in very handy when I need it and the cons takes some getting used to, but great product in the end."
3,Outdated Maps,I have had the Magellan Maestro 4000 for 2 weeks & have found that the mapping is not accurate & very outdated. I hope that Magellan will offer an updated mapping for this unite. Dick
4,Magellan Maestro 4000,"Good product. However, 4040 or 4050 would be better considering only a slight price difference."
2,Not worth the hassle,"We purchased this product. It took 7 days just to get an email back. We put it on our credit card. One day it would say pending, then another day it would be gone. I called multiple times on the issue and they said it was the distributions department that is holding it up. Let me call them and get back to you. Then I would hear nothing for about a week. After 3 weeks we called and canceled the product. We were told we would not be charged. Then we see the charge on our credit card. They sent it out anyway. So we called and they said to deny the package and then it would take 7-10 days to refund our money. We denied the package and then it took another 2 weeks because they never updated the shipping info so they had no clue where the package was. Not sure how the product works but I would never purchase from Ritz Camera again."
2,Dangerous to Use,"The wire connection of Magellan Masetro 4000 to cigarette lighter socket is unreliable, giving shaky quality of map video. While driving, I had to repeatedly shut it down, so that the location on where I was driving can be restored. After so many attempts to make it useful, I just finally gave up, and relied on good ole Mapquest."
4,Satisfied customer,The Magellan Maestro 4000 is an excellant product. Extremely accurate and user friendly. Had a damaged instruction CD on arrival and Amazon replaced it within 12 hours. You can not beat that.
2,"terrible item , easily confused",I bought the Magellan. I took it from my house to college. A 4 hour trip. Except it kept wanting me to go a way that is 7 hours. Further in the the middle of the trip it got lost and changed time to arrival and miles to next action.
2,Nice display but not many features,I had a cheap $99 Garmin and I'm switching back to it. The display is great on this model but the features are lacking.
3,"Good Features, but Poor Upgrades","I purchased two of these units on a special purchase during the 2008 holiday season. One was for my wife. While the map is easy to read and the large screen is more than appreciated, I'm very disappointed in the available updates. Magellan offers only an annual update that costs nearly as much to download as the GPS, itself, cost me. The Magellan branded POI files are very skimpy and I have yet to find any POI (point of interest) files compatible with the Maestro product line. If you want basic navigation and plan on using this on established roadways, entering custom addresses wherever you go, then you will be satisfied. If you want the most current maps and POI directories, you might want to shop around."
3,Expensive but Cheap,I bought one of these and the first time the screen went out and then when I finally got my GPS back two weeks later I had to send it right back in because the power cord port on the side of the GPS had fallen right in when I had plugged it in but if they can get their design togather it will be a five star machine I would recommend the smaller version its cheaper and I have had less problems with it in 3 years than I have had with the 4000 in 2 months
3,Update Problems!,"Got my 4000 a few months ago. Works great so far but you should check the route it has chosen before you head out. On one occassion it took me the long way, which could have been the fastest based upon speed limits. When I tried to update I got a ""file error, cold boot and retry"". Followed all directions, tried on two different computers and still the same. Called tech support and no luck. I suggested they have a center where you could send the unit for updates and that they could charge for the service. Still trying to update, no luck. My thought is to send the unit back for warrenty repair as it will not update. Let them figure out the problem."
4,Maestro 4000,"I like the maps and colors and the POI for next exit feature. I would like to see more info like altitude and an easier interface for trip computer numbers like avg mph, moving avg, elapsed time, stopped time, max speed etc.Overall a good product for the money."
4,Magellan Maestro 4000 GPS,"This is my first GPS navigator so I don't have anything else to compare it to. This is a very nice product, easy setup, easy interface, nice bright screen in daylight. Really like the auto-night feature where it switches the screen colors to black/green. Only disappointment is the short battery life if used unplugged. It seems like 1.5 to 2 hours is all it will do without a recharge or running off the cigarette lighter. The windshield mount suction cup bracket works well although it is a little bulky. Something smaller/slimmer would be nice. Overall very pleased with this GPS."
2,"good product, very disappointed with amazon","We ordered this Magellan maestro 4000 GPS for our Christmas travel. Delivery was fast. However the ""NEW"" unit we received turned out to be a demo unit, which goes into demonstration mode (playing commercial type of introduction video) automatically even during driving, our Christmas trips almost ruined by this. Thinking maybe we missed some important instruction, called Magellan CS and they confirmed it's a store demo unit.Contacted Amazon, and exchanged. The second unit has exactly the same issue. What a dissapointment."
4,Magellan Maestro 4000,"This product worked extremely well on my first trip without using mapquest info, however, two things have not worked well with this,1.) this does not work in Hawaii2.) when we were in Michigan, we couldn't get to the University of Michigan's Gymnastics center (the coach had to come and get us from their stadium).Other than that it worked well everywhere as long as it was around the area in which we were staying."
1,Unit dies after a year...do not buy Magellan!,"This product worked fine for just over a year, and then died on me. I checked Magellan's website and they won't repair it. So this product is a scam, as apparently it is supposed to die after a year, so you'll buy a new one!Terrible, terrible product. I recommend finding a different brand than Magellan when you buy a GPS navigator! I can't recommend any, personally, as I haven't bought any others yet."
4,Maggie Mae,"Maggie Mae as we call her did the job quite well. The directions were great and I love the little ding that is given when you should be makeing a turn. We have use Maggie on 3 trips so far and arrived successfully. I like that it is very easy to attach to our windshield and them remove when we stop. Keying the directions is very easy, the screen is easy to see, and the voice is loud enough to hear."
3,"Good for the Price, Could be Better","This is a good product with some nice features. The good; It comes with almost every thing you need. It does not come with an SD card to save address or perform updates. The Maps are hit and miss. I could not find an address that has been there since 1972. I can understand 2007, but 1972. Traffic Alert does not work. Also it will take you up to mile out of your way to get to some destinations. Over all good product for Amazon's price."
4,Maestro 4000,"I have not had a problem with this product. It has met all my expectations. The only downside that I could see is that they could update their maps. I know of at least two places in my state where the road has changed at least 3 years ago and they are not reflected on the unit. Seeing as I just purchased this, the maps would be up to date."
4,Great Buy,I've used this GPS system on three trips since I made the purchase and I must say that I'm overall pleased with nearly every aspect of the Magellan Maestro 4000. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5-star review is that it didn't blow my mind entirely and I reserve that rating for products that blow my mind.
1,Prada Makeup Bag was a Fake (in my opinion),"I received this Prada Makeup bag as a gift after putting it on my Amazon wish list. When I received it, it looked to me to be clearly a fake (since I have owned an authentic one before). I took it to the Prada store in Beverly Hills to have the authentication card examined. And they said that they have no way of verifying a card that's not from their own store. So really, an authentication card means nothing if Prada themselves can't verify it. However, they examined the bag and agreed that it didn't look authentic in their opinion. The Prada logo had sharp edges on the bolts. And the inside leather tag was crooked and smudged. And didn't resemble the normal tags that come with that bag. Also the material was similar by stiffer than the real bags. However, since real ones are $135, you may not care."
5,"Fabulous, good looking keyboard","As I type this review, I am using this keyboard. Overall it is a great standard keyboard...here are the ups and downs.Pros+ GREAT color scheme, handsome two-tone+ Keys are very quiet+ Has the two outstanding keyboard qualities: Large backspace key, separate numpad & Arrow keys+ One of the smaller keyboards, fits on my small desk+ Handy mute buttonCons+ Rarely annoying sleep button+ Small F-keys"
3,HP P2358AA Keyboard,"I had this keyboard a couple years. Great keyboard. However the characters rubbed off some of the keys.Would never buy again, so now I have a Saitek Eclipse II with the keys lit up by leds."
3,"Unfocused, but mildly amusing.","""It does not lather, nor does it clean."" So goes the unfilled promise both of Harry Crews' novel and the product its ""Soaps For Life"" employees hock from door to door. From its slapslick moments, to its hairpin plot turns and half-realised themes Crews never manages to fully explore his territory, never makes his characters likeable or hateable enough for the reader to buy into their predicaments. Unfortunately, we are left with a shoddy soft-sell. Mr. Crews never gets us to sit down at our kitchen table and buy into his prose. He shys away at the door and tumbles off down the block."
3,Pretty good,"""Mulching"" is a fairy tale turned upside-down. Hickum Looney is a lonely salesman who seems to know of nothing but work. He sells soap and other soap-like products for a big company that is micromanaged (absolutely) by a completely deranged, cleft-lipped midget with a nasty violent streak. This is a hallucinogenic parody about corporate life and soaring corporate greed. The plot itself makes very little sense and the book suffers from a surplus of dialogue that is sometimes as painful as it is unnecessary."
3,One of the better ones,"I don't see how others can put this book down so much, it's definetly one of his better books. Although, yes, I have to admit it does slow down a bit and the characters aren't as defined, almost as if Harry got lazy around the middle. But I would definetely recommend this book to people who like the ethical kind of graphic expose' books."
2,a rushed work to say the least...,"The Mulching of America is almost a lot of things- almost a great allegory for blind allegiance (religious, political or otherwise), almost a brilliant satire on corporate America and almost an engrossing page turner... but because it is only almost all of those things it falls far short of being anything great- especially for Harry Crews. Initially the strong premise and requisite eccentric characters draw you in but the plot of the novel never comes into complete fruition and the reader is left unfulfilled and sorely disappointed to the point of frustration.Worth the read? Yes (I give it 2.5 stars actually), just prepare yourself for abject disappointment in the end."
2,A poor showing from Crews,"I LOVE some of Harry Crews' work so this came as a real disappointment. It seems designed to work as a sort of anti-establishment fable, and some of the characters are typical of Crews' better work. But this book lacks the heart and the careful plotting of the better books. It's almost as if this is self-parody, a kind of Harry Crews-meets-Soylent Green. I don't suggest this unless you are a committed fan!"
3,Start elsewhere,"If you're new to Harry Crews, don't start here. This book is rather uninspired and nowhere close to the high quality of Crews' other, earlier works. If you're curious about this unique writer's work, start with A Feast of Snakes. It's unarguably his finest work of fiction. His memoir, A Childhood: A Biography of a Place, is among the best works of creative nonfiction written in and about the South. A must read."
5,"Passed the test, thanks to the book.","The book is very comprehensive, and allowed me to breeze through the exam in 45 minutes. The questions in the exam is very similar. I definitely recommend this book for people who already have a working knowledge of SQL/ PLSQL. One problem I did have was the way in which the Sybex test questions are formatted: The little windows with the scrollbars make hugh chunks of code reallt hard to read. My suggestion is to use this as a study guide, but take the test at a prometric center, as they have a easier to use interface."
3,Good Reference,"The book cover all the Oracle objectives exam, but it does not dig into the interesting/hard topics. Too many pages are dedicated to references stuff like single row and group functions which are not so deeply asked in the real exam. The exams included in the CDrom are not to tide to the Books material and go beyond exam objectives, watch out because these questions can mislead you on how well you are prepared for the exam.I recommend using Self Test Software as well with this book and the one from Oracle Press."
2,"Good Paper book, Bad eBook","I recommend the book. It's a good training/reference book. But, don't by the book if you plan to use the eBook, which I did. It has some form of protection that is only compatible with a much earlier version of Adobe Reader, plus it requires the installation of other security software. I didn't know that and now I get errors every time I open Adobe Reader. When I called the publisher, they recommend I remove the current version of Adobe Reader and install the older version of Reader. Not going to happen."
2,You won't pass the 1Z0-007 exam with just this book.,"I just passed 1Z0-007 a few hours ago making 90% (47 of 52) first try. Trust me, If I ONLY studied this book, I would have failed. This book has so many mistakes that it will make you go crazy. It's completely outdated. It doesn't have the current exam objectives. The wording and content placement of this book is terrible. I should have bought the oracle 9i OCP: sql studyguide by Oracle Press.Get the Self Test Software. It will save you a retake.I'm studying Oracle's 10g PL/SQL book and Self Test for the next test.I can't wait to be an OCA!"
4,Would recommend this book for 1z0-007 exam,"I used this book to pass the Introduction to Oracle 9i: Sql 1z0-007 certification test. The fundamentals presented in this book were instrumental in getting me through (49/52).The tests and the flashcards on the cd were very helpful.Having said that...1. There are a few errors in the book ...nothing serious but go through the errata on the book site before you start studying.2. This book should be supplemented by a reference book and/or self test software to better benefit from it.Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to pass 1z0-007 and then some."
3,Please help Me Guys,"Hello I am Tulasiraj ,I am doing my PL/SqL course now i am going to write oracle 9i examif any body has current this month model question please send me .thanku"
3,Good but incomplete for the certification,its a good book for start using oracle 9i sql features but if you are trying to get a OCP o OCA certification you must think againand choose the oracle press version of this book
5,One of a kind,"Oldies, but goodies, what can I say. You have to be there. My wonderful sister and brother-in-law introduced me to this CD. Get it when you can."
5,The Best,"This album makes me cry everytime I listen to it. It also brings back the memories of seeing them in concert. They were awesome live as well. Sadly, Robert Beaumont passed away before he could create more of this soulful music. (i'm sorry to this day that i didn't accept his lei after we saw them at conroy bowl)Buy this album. It will make you feel like you are gliding like the titular seabird on the wind."
2,will probably break down in 3 years,"While they may rightly claim that the light bulb will last for long time and that it takes very little electricity, but you still won't save any money. This is because the ballast would likely go bad in 2-3 years, as it happened to mine. The ballast cost around $70.Other than that the white light is great as it should be."
1,Review of Ott Lamp,"While the lamp was received very quickly, it didn't work and my attempt to contact the customer service dept at the company went unanswered. I was unable to disassemble the lamp in order to ship it back in its original container as the directions said (that's how good the lamp goes together and 'stays' together, so I had to get someone to help disassemble the lamp - an electrician to fix the wires in the base (which is why the lamp wasn't working in the first place) and then I could reassemble to parts. That shouldn't have happened and the company should have contacted me when I sent them an email to the address specified in the instructions. What a waste of money and time! As always, you get what you pay for! No bargain here."
4,My greatest sewing lamp,This is truly a terrific lamp. I am extremely pleased and I got a very good price.
2,Skip,"I like shoot videos but you can get most of them for free on You Tube. The problem with the set is volume. The background music is loud but some interviews are barely audible. The bonus matches aren't really worth the trouble and Sandman-Jake Roberts match is not really a match. The other two are good though. The video, Forever Hardcore, is 100% better then this set. Get that instead of this film."
1,Life in...what...i just wasted my time watching this!?,"This was boring, and has no value at all to anyone with any sense, however, i suppose for those of you who still believe that ""Hulkamania"" was created b/c of his skills in the ring as a wrestler, opposed to his 'skills' as an actor and the skills of those marketing and promoting him, then hey, you'll enjoy this dvd...but for those of us smart enough to have seen all those punches thrown to the air,those of us that know what happened in KA on may13,99 everyone who remembers oct.5,97 and nov.05 june22,23,24,2007 dates i could continue with as far back as time, and far forward to date!! to fans w/ that knowlege-this dvd is a waste of your money!! beyond the mat however is actually a pretty good one, wish it would've ran longer but other than that it's a good one!!"
3,The Badlanders,"Good Film, and I really enjoyed Borgnine's performance,it was a bit long but I really like the story and the actors."
3,Nice Movie,"It would have helped if I had known that it lacked Subtitles & Closed Captions. So, it cannot be reccomended for elders as the dialogue tends to be indistinque. The film was well acted."
4,Egyptian Slumdog,"A subtitled foray into the hustle and bustle of modern day Cairo with elements of morality, fundamentalism, romance and adolescent angst. Appealing characters that reminded me very much of Slumdog Millionaire."
2,"Entertaining, but ...","It is a good book for entertainment but cant said to be a good literature. It may even be in the category of ""children sf books"". For teenagers I would highly recommend but for adult sf lovers no need to read."
4,Excellent treatment of familiar territory.,"This story harkens to the ""Horatio Hornblower"" novels as much as Robert Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers."" A well-executed read that should be a good introduction to the genre for young readers. If you want to give the gift of science fiction to a young reader, this book or ""Star Voyager Academy"" is an excellent start. I enjoyed this book for no other reason than it was not a dark and depressing future. That vision, unfortunately, comes in the third book of this series."
4,Good Space Opera!,"Fortchen's second installment in the ""Star Voyager Academy"" series is a good one!This isn't high art, but this relatively short book will certainly entertain the reader.I look forward to the next volume."
2,"Clear writing, disappointing and juvenille plot","Not having read the first book, I can't say if this sequel was better or worse than the first. However, as a standalone novel, I was disappointed by this book. The plot was juvenille. In the end, I did not care about the characters or their plight."
2,Luke warm,"I had hign hopes for this book but the more I read the more I was disappointed. I realized this was a book more suited for 1960's hippies than the contemporary theologian. His theology is a mile wide and 1/2"" deep."
3,Glad I Got this one,"I got this for my son who is only 4 1/2 and he hasn't opened it yet since it's for x-mas. Anyway, I know he will love it, he's into dinasours and dragon phase and has a great imagination so I know he will love this one. Though I think the flaming tongue will probably break off pretty easily because it appears to be fragile and I know my son may be a bet rough with it. However the detail and paint on this toy was done very well. If your child has a good imagaination and love dragons then I'm sure he/she will like this very much."
1,Not what was advertised by Cloud 9 Books Inc.,"I ordered this book ""New"" from Cloud 9 Books Inc. as a gift for a friend, paying the new price. When I received it (late) it was obviously not new. They had whited out where someone's name had been. I will not order from them again. This is more a review of the book company, not the book."
2,Mediocre tale,"Curzon himself was no prize, surely one of the most vainglorious men ever to walk the earth, and his position as Viceroy of India fairly turned his head. His first wife, the American heiress Mary, died too soon and had she lived a bit longer her influence might have prevented her three daughters from going on in the profligate way they did. Or is that mere sentimentality? Whatever it is, it's the crux of Anne de Courcy's listless group biography.The author's research, while it makes for pleasant reading, hasn't uncovered anything really new about the three unpleasant Curzon sisters. The reader ultimately feels sympathy for the UK novelist Elinor Glyn, who wrote ""It,"" with whom Curzon dallied after Mary died and whom he betrayed as cavalierly as he served the people of India.I suppose there are readers who like Diana Mitford and who will be interested in the other women in her husband's brutish life. They will lap this up like lackeys."
3,Triple trouble,"This is a sound biography on the Curzon sisters and a superior work to de Courcy's biography on Diana Mitford, Oswald Mosley's second wife. Mosley features frequently in this account of Lord Curzon's three daughters and his involvement with all three sisters is sure to raise eyebrows.The book reads easily and it does provide a fascinating insight into the glamour filled days of 1930s London. Contrasting with the parties, lunches and extravagance is the political evolution of Mosley and his wife. Their shift from the Conservatives to Labour and finally to the British Union of Fascists highlights the problems faced by working class Britons during the depression.Although not as well written or researched as Robert Skidelsky's biography on Mosley, this is a nice introduction to the world of the British aristocracy in the 1930s."
5,what were they thinking,"Having read over and over again about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, I was curious about who their peers were. Here is a book that presents a group of ""wannabees"" who clearly had the potential to do so much more with their lives but fell short. I found pity for the daughters who lost their loving mother. Living unfocused lives these sisters squandered themselves. This book deserves to be screened. Anyone interested in the lives of the British uppercrust will have a delicious treat."
1,Does Not Work,I downloaded the game off of Amazon and when I attempt to run the game it asks me to insert a disk... Great job modern technology thank you for stealing my money..
3,Tojan/Backdoor,"I have previously played ""Rollercoaster Tycoon 2"" but recently lost the disc copy I had, and decided that so I wouldn't lose the disc I would try Amazon's game downloader when attempting to run/install this program my AVG pop's up with the a message of the file containing a Trojan/Backdoor virus and was wondering if there was any way of fixing things. I am giving this three stars because Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is a very fun game for people who enjoy constructing and running there own businesses, but until the virus issue is resolved this will only get 3 stars..."
4,Game was good-service could have been better,"Though I did receive the game just as I ordered, it took longer than it should have to arrive at my house. It surpassed the last day of the range I was supposed to expect. I think I got it 2 or 3 days after that, actually."
3,RCT Triple Thrill Pack,"let me guess, another combination of the 1st three games right? well, im not sure but i would say thats the way its gonna be. they have zero information on the game as of now. On the Amazon sales rank list, its 2091st. so lets stay away from this one. I have RCT 2 an i think its great but this is just a different combonation of a couple of the RCT games, nothin new. I give this 3 stars because i think we all know whats coming."
1,old outdated pc game,"the whole idea behind this is to make your own park. But the music and sounds effect for hours will drive you crazy, and there are no settings to turn off all the sounds of the game. Over all it is old and outdated."
1,Symetric but fun,"RCT2 incluye ya a RCT1 con sus expansiones, pero este pack incluye eso y 2 expansiones con cientos de atracciones, tiendas, escenarios y cosas para personalizar tu parque tematico, pero esta vez la variante seran la epoca y el lugar."
4,Great Game,I played this game years ago and had tons of fun. it's a great game and any tycoon fan would LOVE this game.
5,Great game,"You'd think that there's not much more that could be added to the first Roller Coaster Tycoon, but this game did not fail in impressing. New ideas for parks as well as themes and goals are imaginative and fun. Definately recommend this product."
5,Worth it,"I had the original Roller Coaster Tycoon a long time ago, and wanted to try this one. Most of it seems the same, bit better graphics. The great things are that the challenges are a system of easy, med, hard and the hard is very challenging. Also, a bunch of extra and different rides and shops."
3,Good Buy for 3 Bucks,Its an old game but its pretty good for 3 dollars. I love that you can play this just about a billion different ways.
1,Does not work on all Windows 7 computers,"A lot of people, including me, are having major issues getting this to work on windows 7. Be aware of this before you buy it and also be aware that there are no refunds. So if it doesn't work out on your computer you're out $10. I am very angry that I can't get my money back and am never buying software from amazon again."
2,"Great offer, but.....","Interesting that nobody's mentioned this.. After install, it says you must insert the CD rom. Being a download, obviously this is impossible. What gives?"
5,Roller Coaster Tycoon 2,I used this game as part of a summer enrichment program on Simple Machines and Roller Coasters.The students who played it loved it.I am a middle school teacer who has taught for 37 years (18 in Boston and 19 in Florida.
2,Not a fan,It is not like the the old rollercoaster tycoon and is a bit complicated. The food stands and rollercoasters do not have the design and the game has a lot of limits on how to build your coaster. I think It could just be me and not playing the game enough. I got bored with this game.
1,Disappointing graphic,"Our family has been a Roller Coaster Tycoon family from waaay back. We had many of its incarnations. Our son wanted to play on his laptop. We thought the easiest thing would be to order from Amazon and have it sent directly to his laptop. The picture is small and does not come close to filling the screen. So, it is really a waste."
5,Always been a RCT fan,"So I thoroughly enjoyed getting this again. While my eyes were literally shocked because it is the old school graphics still, my wallet was extremely happy in that it only cost 10 for all 3 games. Download was quick on my 10g connection and it's the only game installed on my computer other than WoW. So I like it.Perfect for any RCT fan."
3,It is fun for light gaming,"I am a huge fan of this series and played for years. Then I decided to create a massively huge and intense park. I chose the biggest map available and divided them into nine sections. When I started the third section of the park, the park's path got too complex for the AI to handle, and the guests would walk and behave strangely. So I realized that this cannot be fixed and it does not worth to develop the park further at that point. It was a very depressing experience."
5,One of my fav's,I remember playing it for the first time. One of my favorite games of all time.I would have easily paid 20 dollars for this. At ten you really can't go wrong. BUY IT.
3,Simple and time killing,Not a bad game but not a thriller. If you are bored and just want to kill some time then this is definitely the game for you.
4,Roller Coaster Tycoon II - version two of the classic,The original was perfect. This one is slightly better. One of the best PC strategy games ever. My son and I have been playing it for years.
4,Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 Triple Trill Pack,I boaght this for my 8 year old daughter and I can't seem to get her off her laptop for anything. This game is actually alot of fun for the both of us because she enjoys making rides for me since I am a big Roller Coaster Freak. I would recommend this game if asked.
1,does not work,This does not work on the computer. I cannot find a patch to get my game to work on my computer.
3,"Outdated Graphics, but fun game","I really forgot how old and outdated the graphics are in this game, but i loved playing it as a kid, so i went for it. It is fun, but the visuals are a bit clunky."
1,Why?,I downloaded this because I love the first one. It didn't install into my computer. SO I can't really review the game. I contacted Atari more then six times and got no response from them. SO I have given up on trying to buy this since Atari seems to have given up on its customers. Thank God Amazon has a great customer service. They refunded my money with no questions or anything just gave it back. Thanks amazon EPIC FAIL ON ATARIS END
4,"Ahh, Nostalgia","While I prefer RCT-1, Rollercoaster Tycoon is a fair follow-up. There is enough variety in rides and stalls to keep you occupied in each scenario- to a point. (Thus the 4-stars) True, RCT2 is fun for a few hours, the game requires you to play the same scenarios over again with increasing difficulty and slight modification to the ""accomplished"" requirements. A little repetitive, but fun all the same."
2,Download doesn't work like cd,"I downloaded this and it seemed to work fine, but about half way through each game - it would stop adding or subtracting money so no way to win scenarios with funds involved."
5,Awesome!,I got addicted to this game again! Used to play it a lot when I was 12 and now I'm 21 and I still love it!
5,Fun game.,"I played the first game for many years before mastering it. This game is of course similar to the first but with new designs, challenges and difficulties."
4,happy with purchase,"It should have come with the camera. Great case, practical and small. Just the quality of the leather is not too good"
5,Highly Recommended!,"Once upon a time in the halls of academia, being a college graduate was enough. But now, corporations need their employees to have a more intense, ongoing academic and technical education, so they provide it themselves via corporate universities. Mark Allen and other experts from ten corporate universities, academic institutions and consultancies contributed chapters to The Corporate University Handbook, a practical, behind-the-scenes manual about designing and managing a corporate university. The goal goes beyond education: corporate universities must train employees and help corporations excel and prosper. This thorough, yet conversational, examination includes best practices, source notes and programs offered by specific companies including Motorola, Toyota, Sun Microsystems and Charles Schwab, in the U.S. and elsewhere. We from getAbstract assign this insightful book as an authoritative homework seminar for corporate university planners or managers."
1,Disappointing,"Sandra Lee Gupton could have written many useful pointers and tips in her book, but it was lost in all of the wordiness and citations. It was written as though it were a research paper or thesis. The ""Pointers for the Principal"" were handy, but otherwise I found it to be terribly disappointing."
5,For those who want to be in love forever,"From the book: ""As you persevere, resolving never to give up, you begin to see that there is a sweetness growing within you that surpasses everything you have ever dreamed of--a communion with the Divine that nothing can touch . . ."""
5,Profoundly Simple; How to love the God within.,"Daya Mata, president of Self-Realization Fellowship, gives the reader the clearest and simplest guide to knowing divine love.

It is the type of gift that one will never be tired of using, as a daily inspirational motivator and guide to a more complete and fulfilling life in the spirit.In this most difficult of human quests, Daya Mata immediate takes the reader directly to the method of success."
5,Bet on this one,This book probably will be as readable as his Kennan book. Russell writes clearly and edits relentlessly.
4,Almost perfect nametags!,"The nametags were great for our 45th class reunion. It was easy to assemble our information into them, but the fact that they were not clear and had a texture to them, made it hard to read what was inside. The description did not state that they were ""frosted"", but that they were white, which was misleading."
3,Brain Teaser,"This board game makes you think. But some of the ""30 second mysteries"" are so ""off the wall"", no one would think of them. Was very simple to play, but not worth the money. Not what I thought it was. Disappointed in the game."
4,History Of HipHop,"This is how it all started...that what HIP HOP was all about...the elements were the key to keep this movement growing...GRAFFITI and Breakdancing is focused in this DVD.As a graffiti writer i found it very iteresting...and shows once again a truth that its deined nowdays...Hip Hop was not only a Black thing...but a all race thing:black(lee etc) white(iz the wiz etc..), italians(Seen,dondi etc..) latins(rock steady, crazy legs etc..).Amust for all graffiti fans"
5,History,This is a must have video...I was about twelve or thirteen when this was released...I was only able to catch a glimpse of it on PBS when it was first aired twenty years ago. Coming from a kid who was into breakdancing and graffiti...I highly recommend it!
3,missing the marks,"Having only recently become interested in graffiti, I purchased this collection in hopes of seeing graffiti being created firsthand. While there is a short segment with the artist SEEN and one with CAP I was a bit disappointed in not seeing more work being done first hand. On the bonus disc IZ does a quick piece, but nothing wildstyle. The documetary is very well made and is a useful piece of history, I was just hoping to learn more about how graffiti is physically made than its history and thoughts of then current practitioners. Buy it for a bit of history and to see the trains rolling all pieced up. Maybe someone will do a documentary on the freights and have more shots of pieces being created rather than just filming already existing work."
1,Oh well,"I wasted my money, because I need to find something different. I spent a long time researching online, trying to find what would be appropriate for me. I needed something for running that was somewhat water resistant. My complaints are: 1) the iPod does NOT fit properly in the case. The plastic scratched my iPod, and the round hole for accessing the wheel never ever aligns properly. 2) The material has ripped, the neoprine parts are stretched out and broken down 3) my arm is so small, the arm cuff doesn't fit right, no matter how I align the arm band (there isn't enough velcro on it) 4) they totally designed it badly, so it flops around on my arm too much, even if the armband did fit right. I look at this thing now and can think of ten different ways to improve it. I guess I have to get back out there and find something that works better."
5,This is a replacement,This is a replacement Sportsuit. I hope we get the years of use from this one that we got from the first one. It lasted years.
3,A surprising error,"I haven't finished the book yet. In a discussion of the novel's characters' names (p 155) the authors three times identify Victor Frankenstein's father as ""Adolphus,"" when it is in fact ""Alphonse."" A very minor error, you might say. In fact the matter of names and language is not a trivial aspect of the novel, as the Hooblers themselves argue. The name Mary Shelley invents for Victor's father reflects a hybrid nationality that comes up repeatedly throughout the story (e.g. Victor is ""by birth a Genevese"" who was born in Naples, Italy and educated in Bavaria). ""Adolphus Frankenstein"" sounds just German. ""Alphonse Frankenstein"" suggests an amalgam of origins--not unlike the Creature?"
3,"Informative, but not particularly profound","This book gives an interesting biography of Mary Shelley and of the people who were closest to her. The authors do a good job, in my opinion, of making a correlation between Mary and Frankenstein's monster (both of them lonely outsiders), but they stretch credibility a bit with their theory of a curse. They bring up this theory of a curse in the introduction, but they never really follow through with it and elaborate on it in any detail. They bring it up repeatedly, even suggesting that the death that surrounded Mary was somehow caused by the book, but they never provide any evidence for this idea."
5,More Beautiful Than the Picture!,"The picture just does not do this stainless steel justice! Each place setting is truly a work of art. The feel of each piece in your hand is just right. It's neither too heavy, nor too light.I was perusing Amazon for some nice flatware for my daughter and her husband when I came upon this amazing bargain. Her husband is almost through building her a beautiful home in 20 acres of lush woods and they're total country folks. (The house has a big front porch and back porch). Her husband is an avid duck hunter, so the game bird motif is perfect. I never have thought I could afford such a nice set as this, and I am overjoyed with both the price and the high quality.If you're looking for a unique set of flatware, definitely buy this set!"
5,Wonderful set,"A great set. I love the different birds on each piece. They are a very nice weight and silky feeling finish. Very high quality set, but I cannot find serving pieces. If that is important to you, I don't know that I would recommend it."
1,Only because I couldn't go any lower,"This book was not good. It sounded like the ramblings of a 17 year old girl. It was terrible, I just wasn't feeling it. And I am very disappointed because I got this book on the strength of the reviews, they must have been her cousins or something, because I just don't understand how they could give this mess more than two stars (and I am being very generous with 2)."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"And don't buy a book based on good reviews by readers. I gave the author two stars for her effort but for me this book was a big disappointment. I forced myself to finish it to find out why so many here thought it was great. It was nothing more than the story of a woman bouncing from man to man and job to job, doing almost anything for money. The characters were too vague."
2,I shoulda seen it comin,I shoulda seen it coming Not really a good story predictable plot.could have bee a lot better written.too much sexual and not enough of the real story.
5,Head banger,This author keeps your head spinning. I love Zsaset's attitude and character. She reminds me of so many ladies in the world graving a ganster.A MUST READ!!
4,Slick,I bought this item after looking for a Digital watch. The display is awesome when the function/mose key is pressed. Its a little bit heavy but thats no major flaw. The other thing in the day the display can be obscur.
2,K Cole watch,"This watch is heavy, some may like that . The display is very dim even with the illumination , and the viewing angle is narrow you have to hold it just right to read it . To much work just to see the time ,like while driving or such. I was lured by the large display with all the info on screen at the same time (time,date,ect.) but the con's out weighted the pro's"
3,Fathers day gift,"I havent given it to him yet will let you know how he likes it, but it looks to be a really nice and durable watch."
4,claude is good,I frankly thought this would be another amaturish goody two shoes success book but this Claude guy has something special. I bought the book and listened to the narration tapes in the car and then I called with the free mentoring gift certificate included. I don't know too many authors so it was real thrill to be able to speak with a real author millionaire.I love the 10 rules of success and have them on my desk. and I use them to motivate me every day.Good Stuff- Debby
5,very motivational !,I found this book to be a pleasure to read from the first page. The narative tapes by Mr. Diamond tapes great for my Dad who has sight problems and loves books.The story seems to weave around a self pitying character named Ralph who discovers the secrets of success fromThe Mentor Max while jetting all around the world meeting other millionaires .Good valueJoe
3,Apt title,"Well, there's certainly truth in advertising here. These boogies are endless, but they're pretty good, too, for all their length. This isn't prime Hooker, not even close, but it's nice music of Hooker boogying with a bunch of (mostly) rock musicians. Not bad, for what it is, but there's a ton of better John Lee Hooker out there. Five stars? Give me a break."
3,Where the other tracks go?,"be aware that the BGO release omits 4 tracks, about 23 minutes, while the MCA release has all 11 tracks.Missing tracks include the House Rent Boogie (later covered by George Thorogood), Standin' At The Crossroads, Doin' The Shout, A Sheep Out On The Foam."
1,Beware! This is a paperback edition,"The content of the book is excellent. The paperback format is attrocious.The cover on most decent paperbacks contains a crease front and back near the binding to assist in opening. This does not. No matter how carefully you try, when you open the book the cover cracks unevenly. The book won't stay open so it is difficult to play the examples given. I am not sure the book will hold together by the time it takes to complete it. This binding is something you might expect on a cheap $1 paperback not one that costs a $100.Whoever is responsible for this at Prentice-Hall ought to be drawn and quartered."
4,Cord,This 10-foot cord works perfect for my daughter's needs with her guitar! She has no complaints! it's long enough for use.
3,It works ok,The cable seems to work ok and looks ok but it's very light and seems a little cheap because of that. I don't imagine it's shielded very well so I'll plan on just using it at home. I have been having noise issues with my cables on stage so even though I bought this to use there I decided to pick up a premium cable for the stage. I hope this helps.
3,Rather boring...,"I'm afraid I lack appreciation for this product (whether it truly deserves it or not). I fear I would thus be biased in rating it anything under 3 stars. However... it truly is a boring and not very enriching read. I had to purchase it for a class and have certainly had to force myself to read through a number of the selections already. Furthermore, [and I'm sure some philosophers would disagree with me here, but as for me...] The topic matter and arguments both lack real, practical applications and use (unnecessarily so) overly-technical terms and such, all of which make reading this incredibly tiresome and difficult."
4,Doesn't fit the 1500,The Amazon webpage says this will fit the 2006 Dodge ram 1500. Not true. It will fit the 2500 and 3500 models only. Otherwise it looks very well built like other Reese products too bad I had to return it.
3,Small Cabbage Patch Dolls Short on Value,These are surely cute but they didnt last a full day in my home. The pieces are very tiny. If they are dropped they are gone! These would be good for a collector. Not practical to play with.
5,Customer Review of Hermit Songs,What a fabulous collection of music by Samuel Barber. Stella Black is at her absolute best in the Hermit Songs. She sings with great sensitivity and her commitment to the music comes through. This CD on which Ms. Black memorializes many of the songs by Sam Barber should be in every collection of those who appreciate Barber's vocal music. He is a renowned American composer of classical music. You will not be disappointed if you buy this CD.
5,memories of 1970's hawaii,Gives me back so many memories I had growing up with friends who were also big fans of the music and of spending time there in the 70's when life in general was mellower all the way around. All the locals know this is true. Miss Mackey Ferry a great deal and listening to his songs sometimes makes me cry.....for his passing and for the fond memories of my youth.
5,Fantastic CD,"I loved Kalapana when I was growing up in Hawaii , but since moving to the states I stoped listening to them . I went back home for a visit and since returning back to Georgia I got homesick and decided to buy this CD. I love it and love every song on it..."
4,Sea Horse,"This book was fun to read at times, though it did start to drag and get a little dull at times. The story tells of Lisa and her parents visiting the island of San Marco for New Years. Lisa starts the horseback riding program there only to fall off twice and start to doubt her riding ability. Carole thought that anything to do with horses was fun, but training Starlight seems more like work, and finds that it would be more fun if her friends were there. Stevie wants to find the perfect gown for a New Year's party at Phil's school. She has a terrible time trying to find the perfect one only to find out that it's not formal at all! The book was fun for any reader who enjoys the saddle club as much as I do. The series is great, it teaches you a lot, and stimulates into human behavior as well as a horses'. Highy reccommended."
3,waste of $,"this item is decent for a newborn, but i would suggest to just use the footed sleepers, you will be swaddling the baby anyways so the bulky-ness of this is really not a useful item."
1,OUTRAGEOUS PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!,"My daughter has been using a sleep sack since she was two weeks old. It is great, I wouldn't use aything else. We purchase ours from Walmart ($8.00) We've had a hard time finding since, so we bought larger fleece sleep sacks and cut the arms off. (From ToysRUs on sale for $9)"
1,Nightmare for Me!,"This blanket seemed great, until one evening, when I found my six month old gaging on a metal piece which came off the zipper of the sleep blanket. I haven't heard of anyone else reporting this problem. Perhaps the blanket I had was just the lemon in the batch. But still, this lemon could have had serious implications for my infant. So, needless to say I am switching to a sleep blanket with a safer design."
5,Convenient and safe,"I love this sleep blanket. I have had many different brands and this one is by far the better. The sleepsack zippers from the top down. This is great because the other brands do the opposite (zip from the bottom up like all other clothes). This prevents the zipper handle from rubbing and jabbing into baby's face. This was the problem that I have had with the other sleepsacks. They are a little pricey, I would recommend pricing them out at different stores. I bought mine for $12.99. They also come in larger sizes. My 5 month old is wearing size 6-12 months and has plenty of leg room. There are even larger available, but I doubt my little one would care for it once she is mobile."
3,Zippers Are Terrible,"These sleep sacks are fine, but the zippers are terrible. They are very stiff and seem to bunch up near the top, so the zipper is always in baby's face. I prefer the Lullabags - zipper is at the bottom so no bunching and makes it easier for diaper changes."
3,Way overpriced,"(...) As first I loved it and my baby did too so I went and bought another. Now, my baby is 2 1/2 months and both zippers have broken. On one, I seriously had to rip my screaming baby out of it because he was stuck. (...) there should be a decent enough zipper attached. I honestly don't know if I will purchase the next size all because of the zippers."
1,"Would have rated it 5 stars, but...",I absolutely loved this sleep sack until today. I put my baby in it before a nap and when I zipped it the entire zipper pull fell off the end. I was unable to get it back on and I couldn't pull the zipper apart. I had to have my husband come home from work to help me cut the fabric to remove it from my baby (impossible to safely do alone).
4,Does what it claims to do...,I was looking for video of the 155mm Long Tom and it is shown in this collection albeit briefly. Quality of the video is good.
2,Poor quality,The quality of this product is very poor. The cotton storage bag is practically see-thru or very thin. This is comparable to a king size pillow case with less than 150 thread count if you know what I mean.
5,Great French Text,"The French Experience is a great book for a beginner's course in French. The grammar is logically presented, the student learns expressions that are in current use in France, the cultural sections are state-of-the-art, and the coversational examples are right on. In short, the book is ideal for teaching students who are going to have to speak French as soon as possible. Like many British products of this type, it is a well-thought out guide that is extremely useful."
4,Easy to use,"Not much to say about printer address labels, other than they are easy to use and don't appear to stick in the printer, as past products have been know to do."
5,Imaginative and very creative; a new and refreshing sound,"These guys have broken out of the mold and created what I consider a new and refreshingly artistic nitch in the music world. A tasteful blend of folk, rock, jazz, and country that's really hard to force into any one category. Their roots on the rural Eastern Shore of Maryland, coupled with the completly different 20+ years in NYC brings a certain ""down to earth sophistication"" that is truly unique. Do yourself a favor; buy this album, shut out the stress of the 9-5 for awhile, and escape into their world. You'll be glad you did!"
4,Excallent read for young ones !!,This is one of the best books out there for the young school going children to start their journey to reach the cosmic quandaries.I bought it for my nephews(8 years old and 12 years old). I just hope anyone of them would be motivated to be an astronomer after reading this.......
5,Most amazing book you'll ever read,"I have never, and I mean never, had my mind blown as much as when I read (still reading, will never stop reading) this book. I can't believe the pictures in this book. You think you've seen everything insane and out of this world there is to see and then you open this up. Ever seen one galaxy side-swipe another galaxy? The images in this book will change you, you will never be the same. I feel so small yet I feel like I'm part of this insane monster of a grand scheme. The descriptions are fantastic, you need no prior astronomy/science education to totally immerse yourself in the cosmos. Starting from earth and reaching out to as far as we have gone this book reads as if you are the explorer aboard your space craft taking it all in for yourself. There isn't a dull second during this read. Every paragraph will make your mouth drop. Realize the creature around you that is your Universe."
3,Del Works With Tom Petty And Jeff Lynne With Predictable Results.,"Del Shannon first burst into the charts in the early 1960s with hits including Runnaway, Hats Of To Larry and the fantastic, Little Town Flirt.This album was recorded in 1990, just before his untimely death, and was finally released in 1991.My copy from that year has the 11 original tracks, that is Walk Away to Lets Dance.With a strong, confident voice, plus input from Petty and Lynne, this has a feel good sound, all of which makes his loss the sadder."
4,A Thankgiving Gift from Grandpa,This is a great book to give and to read to your small Grandchildren when they come for Thanksgiving dinner.
3,A little dated,The sentiment is nice but I felt it was like I was back in the early 70's. I felt it was not entertaining enough to keep the interest of my grandchildren.
5,What is your child thankful for? Read & find out!,"This is one of those special books that involve your children and actually makes them think about what are they thankful. For me Thanksgiving is a holiday where family and friends gather around a table full of wonderful food and this is where this book starts. I like that book includes different families and that it doesn't focus on the 1st Thanksgiving, but about things that each child is thankful for. Parents who love them no matter their actions, for books, cats, dogs, bright sunny days, friends and lollipops!What a wonderful book that should also get everyone talking about what they are thankful for!"
2,No flow,This book is a little hard to read aloud because it has no flow. Nothing throws a wrench in story time like a book with no chorus! I wasn't impressed with the list of things to be thankful for either.
5,Thanksgiving Is for Giving Thanks,cute book. My daughter wanted it to use in the class room when she starts teaching.
3,Nice book for Thanksgiving!,"This is a very cute Thanksgiving book. My boys (ages 3 & 6) do seem to enjoy it and do tell me what they are thankful for, after seeing some of the things in the book. It was a bit shorter than I expected though, but otherwise a nice book."
3,Over hyped,I know I will get the negatives but it must be said. This album is over hyped and her first EP is much greater. She is definantly talented as a emcee but there are some week points. It is still a good album but it is not as good as everyone sais it is.To get to affended because this is my honest openion.
3,"No, she isn't what you'd expect","I expected alot more from here. As a rapper. However, as a poet, her words are beautiful and clever. But, it sounds like she is just reading poetry. She doesn't really flow with the music. Dare I say it... it sounds akward for both the listener and Jean? Yes, I said it. Her words are amazing and poetic, but am I supposed to believe she is hard-core? I disagree with the Amazon.com review, Gangsta Boo does not have her dumbed down lyrics. Gangsta Boo, in my opinion, can out rap Jean. I mean, Jean would sit down and cry the way Boo would rip her a new one. It just sounds akward. Basically it's just like her reading poetry over lame beats. Sorry, Jean. You're beautiful as is your poetic vision, but I don't think rap is your fotre'. I would much rather enjoy reading your lyrics than hearing them. I recommend Gangsta Boo (Both Worlds *69) to this CD."
5,Some people don't like smart girls...,"Smart female rappers? Forget it. Smart female rappers who aren't materialistic, don't show their ass, or make their careers off of their gun-toting all-male cliques? Really forget it. Still, there's always going to be those music fans who'll revel in the fresh, biting rhymes of an underground rapper (or, for my part, even an aboveground rapper, as long as the fresh and biting part is still there). ""This Week"" is consistent with Jean Grae's last release, ""The Bootleg..."" but more well-rounded, and with better production. The style, as usual, is very New York, but it doesn't bother me in the least.To Jean Grae: Date me. I'm 28, look 18, white as hell, and can change my weight at will. Click on my e-mail address through Amazon. Gangsta Boo might be in my CD collection, and Trina might be on my wall, but you're in my heart."
