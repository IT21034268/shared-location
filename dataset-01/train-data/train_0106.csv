2,Cumbersome,"The book starts off well but begins to drag at the half-way mark and is a struggle to finish. Overall, the story is far-fetched, particularly the involvement of the TV reporter. That would not happen in the real world."
5,Jack Reacher,At his finest Child paints a vivid taut story with the sexy a Reacher in charge. The motion an logic of the Teacher story are captivating
2,Easily one of the worst books I've read in a nice long time,"I read the 1 and 2 star reviews before purchasing, and thought that I was well prepared for any potential disappointment. NOPE! There are pointless conversations, information is revealed by having Reacher explain very basic concepts to people who SHOULD already know these things, everybody ever said nothing - and these are just the stylistic concerns. There's the plot itself - never mind who pays for parking, who befriends an ex-sniper and goes to the range with him for years and pretends to be a s***ty shot in the random event his crazy ass sniper ways might be of use later??I gave the book two stars because I *was* entertained - it's just that my entertainment consisted of passing the book back and forth with my partner while we both screamed at the top of our lungs how bad it is, and drank waaaaaaaaay too much vodka for every time someone said nothing."
3,A breakneck pace for 450 pages....,"But the last fifty are terrible.Reacher's character is defined by his relentless forward motion. You can see how his adversaries make mistakes. He's always coming at them. They are frustrated, angry, confused, and trying to catch up.That makes Reacher a great character to follow. The plot twists and turns inventively. The prose style is clean and efficient.But then the author has to set up a conventional slambang thriller ending, and forces his characters to make one preposterous decision after another. You may wince. You may cringe. What had been a novel turns into a puppet show.If you can't entirely suspend logic and common sense, you may reach the end of 'One Shot' as annoyed as I was."
5,Love Jack Reacher,Lee Child's recurring character Jack Reacher is such an interesting guy and the stories are great fun to listen to.I was really irked to see that Tom Cruise was cast to play him in the movie...being a bigger than average man is part of Reacher's charm
3,One shot,This was an easy read. Enjoyed the story. Would recommend this book to almost anyone. Narration was off at times though.
4,thinking mans jack reacher,I enjoyed this book because I was able to think along with jack and work my way though the story.Not as violent as other books of his .
5,One Shot,"As always, Lee Child outdoes himself, this is a great story with an excellent and twisted plot. It was interesting to meet some of his old flames and not so good friends. The legend lives on in Indiana, snipers and DA's and cops, not to forget the rookie lawyer.What I cannot understand is how Tom Cruise could be hired to act as Reacher in the movie? I mean how high are his built up shoes going to be?However that knowledge does not detract from the excellent plot at all.Look forward to the next in the series Lee!"
4,That was fun,Very cool change of pace as far as plots are concerned. There was an element of something missing there but all in all still a worthy story!
4,Pretty Good,Jack Reacher can reason the reason out of reason. The guy's incredible. I'm anxious to see the movie now. Good read.
4,One Shot,I found it very entertaining and it flowed quite well. I will read another just to see if I really like the character and writer.
4,Love the reacher series,Great stories! They are always written in a way that are thought provoking and make you think. They always come up with a twist.
5,Jack Teacher One shot.,A Can't put it down book.John Trvolta should play the part.I have been following Jacks adventures for a long time.
4,Much better than the movie!,Very quick read....in the same vein as the other Reacher novels....much better plot than the movie....would highly recommend it to all Lee Child/Jack Reacher fans.
3,Obtuse Plot but Good Summer Read,"Jack reacher works his way through the plots twists and turns looking for what really happened in what at first glance is an open and shut case. I didn't know the Army's Criminal Investigative Division was the breeding ground for semi-superhuman heros but if the author says so it's OK by me. I think of them as E-7's and WO's trying, without much success, to find stolen PC's at Camp Swampy. The hero takes more punishment than any 5 people could stand but still comes back kicking. A nest of Russian former Gulag inmates are his nemises and they are almost, I say almost, up to Jack's level of stoic accomplishment."
3,One Shot,"This book is alright, but not as good as the others. And I don,t think Tom Tom Cruise Cruise Will be a good Reacher.He is way to small small to ply Reacher."
3,So?...,"One of the recurring criticisms of the epic Beowulf is that it is just almost all about killing nasty bad evil things. It isn't, but the belief that an artist should not be praised for what he leaves out about the human condition was reasonably accepted. Until at least about 1962. An elderly reader might ask then, of a story that stresses repeated attention to descriptions of roadways:Reader: So after all of that, you do not at least say good-by to the fourteen year ago flame in your life who reappeared and risked her career for you, and more, and who you took a shower and got a hair cut for?Reacher: ""Reacher said nothing.""Volume 11 of the Reacher novels: Jack Reacher takes the Greyhound to Berkeley."
3,Reacher the Walking Wonder,Unbelievable but fun as Jack cures the evils of the world while on shanks mare. I think he did drive a vehicle at some point in the tale.
4,Good book,"Liked it, good book. Started out a bit slowly but later picked up. Need 7 more words to finish this review"
5,Jack Reacher at his best.,"Lee Child is great in this book. Jack Reacher is at his best in solving the ""crime"" and in defeating his nemises. It has all the elements that Jack Reacher seems to be capable:critical thinking, physical prowess, interpersonal relations and a search for Justice.I highly recommend this book as well as the movie"
4,Good read,"Typical Jack Reacher. Super smart, super tough, solves the crime/problem, gets the girl, then moves on to the next destination via bus. A number of scenes from the ""Jack Reacher"" film closely resemblance to book, but, as you'd expect, there are significant divergences also. Worth picking up."
4,Fast-paced and fun read,"Loved this book for a quick, fast-paced read. First time reading a Lee Child book and now I want to read more!"
4,Great work!,"Another Reacher read as I work my way through them. I loved this one, it was a great story, very entertaining. The characters are all great, I love that Child brought back someone from Reacher's past, sometimes I don't like how he falls into bed with every girl, but this time it made sense. There were some typos in the text, wish they would fix those. After a disappointing read on the last novel (Echo Burning), Reacher is back!!"
5,Jack Teacher One Shot A Novel,I read everything written by Lee Child....can't wait for the next one..Love Jack Reacher will have to see the movie
4,good story,Very good book. I am waiting to see what Tom Cruise does as Jack Reacher in the movie version. Exciting as usual
5,A great book.....,"....turned into an AWESOME movie. People if you like Lee Child's writing, you should love the new ""Jack Reacher"" movie!"
4,Better Than the Movie,"I'm a Reacher fan and have read most of Lee Child's novels. I like the Reacher character, but was disappointed to see 5' 7"" Tom Cruise try to play Reacher in the movie."
4,one shot,Really liked Jack Reacher. Will read more of the Reacher novels. Never knew how he figures out the crime solutions.
4,Compelling read,I rate this one of Lee's better stories. The plot is good and the way he leads you along into the truth of what is happening is tantalising.This is also the one that's the first movie from the series. Unsure about Cruise as Jack though. Doesn't fit in my minds eye with the description of Reacher we all know.Time will tell.
1,Unreadable,"I found this book at the airport, and since I enjoy Ludlum-type thrillers I decided to give this a shot. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get through the first chapter. I found Child's writing to be downright atrocious. Choppy sentences, and repetitive descriptions may work in children's books, but made this book unreadable for me. Maybe it gets better, but I was just not willing to put in the time wincing through poorly written sentences to find out. Next time I'll stick to the real thing and read a Ludlum book."
1,"Lee Child should have ""...said nothing""","I'm halfway through listening to this audiobook and have lost count of the number of times Lee Child writes ""[Character's name] said nothing"". This may seem trivial but, after the 50th use of this needless phrase, you'll be at your wits end too. Any editor worth his/her weight would have cut out 90% of these phrases as they are amateurish and add nothing to the book. You could practically turn these phrases into a drinking game - drink anytime you hear the phrase - guaranteed good times for all!"
4,Good airport novel,"Child's prose style is taut, thus very well suited to the Mysterious Hero theme of the Jack Reacher novels. To call his characters ""cardboard"" would, frankly, be insulting to cardboard, but he writes well enough that you can overlook this.*One Shot* is interesting from the start, and part of that interest is the intricate -- though unlikely -- plot. However, the plot abruptly shifts direction at a certain point in the novel. If you think about it afterwards, you realize that it doesn't make much sense. Or any sense at all, actually.So my recommendation is to read *One Shot*, enjoy it for the nice crisp writing, and don't think about it very much afterwards."
4,An Advanced Book,"This book requires that you can already work with FormZ and seems to be intended for people who are using FormZ to create models to be animated with 3DS or Electric Image. FormZ was at version 3 when this book was written (1999). The approach seems to be that of a person who makes a living building models destined for an animation production environment.The book starts with a heady discussion called ""Digital Production Pipeline and 3D Modeling Process"" and continues in the vein of managing workflow for several chapters.It then progresses to chapters containing ""Exercises"" which are follow along tutorial-style and include such things as engine exhaust nozzles, auto wheels and tires, auto interiors, and a human hand. The exercises show lots of techniques for using FormZ to its fullest, particularly when modeling surface meshes."
1,What a waste of time!,"Too basic! I expected at least more of an intermediate level. Complete waste of time! I'd strongly recommend ""Inside FormZ"" instead."
4,Different is good.,"Okay, I grant this movie is uneven. However, when it does hit, it is scream out loud funny. And the last third of it is unlike anything I've ever seen before - so that scores big points for keeping it interesting. Can't wait to see what these guys do next!"
4,"Finally, An Original Romantic Comedy","It's been a long time coming, but romantic comedies finally have the hope of seeming new and original. I had wanted to see this movie for a long time, and when I finally did, I wasn't at all dissapointed. This film was scalded by bad reviews and low box office take. Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz make a great team. McGregor is an extremly talented actor and he makes a great comic actor! One of the best scenes is where he tries making a ransom call, but has to keep starting over because he messes up! This movie has everything: great direction, good actors, a great story, and puts more than a few more than welcome kinks into the romantic comedy formula, which is turned upside down! This film is underrated and if you've heard all the reviews simply see the film for yourself. And even if you don't like it, it's not a bad Friday night video rental. Check it out."
4,not an ordinary movie,"i didnt really get the angel part..thought it was kinda stupid, but the romantic parts of the movie were what made the movie what is was"
3,More Than Ordinary,"A Life Less Ordinary is one of the more inventive road movies to come down the pike in the last couple of years. It's post-modern and chic and has a soundtrack full of digable cuts. And while it lacks the slick cleverness of director Danny Boyle's other two films--Shallow Grave and Trainspotting--the dopey charm of the two leads makes up for it. There's a certain freshness about the film which allows for a lot of unexpected and sometimes oddly played scenes. One that works the best takes place in a Karaoke cowboy bar. Robert (Mac) is called up to sing a ditty and before you know it Celine (Diaz) and he are tripping the light fanastic in gaudy, hipster duds. It's a killer touch.McGregor brings a witty sheepishness to his role, and Diaz is his perfect antithesis--wealthy, streetwise, and brash. The combination makes A Life Less Ordinary solid and entertaining."
5,Love it!,"This movie was highly enjoyable. Why it was trashed by the critics is anyone's guess. I am so glad I ignored all the bad reviews, cause this is a great movie that I completely fell in love with."
2,Just Dumb!,How this one rated 4+ stars is beyond comprehension. I kept watching thinking it must get better -- well it didn't.
2,What Should Have Been Expected,"Imagine attempting to expand/extrapolate the absolutely trite monologue that opens TRAINSPOTTING into anything other than a glossy picaresque punk romp. Impocerous! There's nothing in/to Boyle, yet, & may never be. Who can say? Diaz IS lovely/charming here, & the attempt is generally sweet, well-meant, but the script is atrocious, sophomoric. A sort of meta-Coens movie minus the brothers' wordy dazzle & deep love for & knowledge of the history of movies. Unfortunate, but there will be more of this sort of thing?"
1,An absolutely awful film!,"of all the bad films I have ever seen this is the worst. The plot is the kind that makes you muddled and dissatisfied. if Cameron Diaz had had a more interesting part I would have said that she played it well, but she had the most boring part ever! By the end of the film I was almost asleep. Although I feel that this would have been a good film if they told you just a little bit about what is going on, I would not reccomend this film to anyone except people who like films that make you feel as if you must have missed a vital line!"
4,Great acting. 16th april 2004.,Hard to explain it but i loved it. There are better films though. The actors were great for there parts thats one thing.
2,A life retarded,"Some parts were good, but it's a movie that you regret wasting part of your life watching. Don't bother..."
1,The worst movie I have seen in my life,"I'm glad I can review it, if only to warn people never to watch this piece of complete and utter garbage. It took me a long time to be able to watch any movie that had either Diaz or MacGregor in it after this one, merely because of how much it stunk.Its a shame I can only go as low as one star, it deserves a lot less than that. It's boring, hard to follow, completely stupid and I'm still not quite certain what exactly happened at the end. Sitting and staring at a blank wall for two hours would be more interesting than this movie, so as a warning, DON'T BUY OR EVEN WATCH IT!!"
2,"""A life very weird""","This is one of those movies that will confuse and befuddle you. Just when you think you are catching on, it changes style and tempo. It wouldn't be that bad a road movie if they cut out the angelic interference and made it a straight character film. Cameron Diaz does a good job playing the spoiled rich witch, and Ewan McGregor does ok as the down on his luck janitor. To make a long story short he ends up kidnapping her (or is it the other way around?) And of course they fall in love at the end. The plot takes on a weird supernatural angle with two angels that try to help the two along in their rocky road to romance. And gets weirder with a drunken hallucination karioke scene. You won't know whether you're coming or going with this movie. Although, after all this I have to say that there were some funny moments that will make you laugh, you'll just wish they ended up in a better film."
5,One of my favorite Ewan movies!,"By far one of my favorite ewan flicks. It's something my friends and I always pull out at parties and quote amongst ourselves. Overall it's just an amazingly fun, cute, quirky movie and is definetely worth a few dozen watches!"
2,Let down...,"From the giddy heights of Trainspotting, Danny Boyle stooped to this. A fairly average romantic comedy with twists. The acting is ok, the script is fairly ordinary. The normally inventive camerawork seems strained, as if Boyle felt pressured to add ""original"" touches to the film that didnt work with them in. It wasnt a bad movie, it just wasnt that great. I really wanted to watch the entire thing but walked out 3/4 of the way through..I just felt i had better things to do. you may do also.."
1,A Quentin Tarantino rip-off at its absolute worst,"This movie is completely irrelevant. I can't even call it a ""bad"" movie because that implies some sort of campy quality that could be appealing. This movie has zero appeal. In fact, I think it should be obliterated. This saddens me, as I am a huge fan of Ewan McGregor and the directing/screenwriting team who created Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. Why did they put wonderful actors like Ian Holm, Stanley Tucci, Tony Shalhoub, and even Holly Hunter through the embarrassment of appearing in this dud? This movie has characters we care nothing about, is pointlessly derivative, plotless, and ends up putting the viewer through a great deal of pain for daring to watch."
1,Are you kidding??,"Anyone who thinks kidnapping at gunpoint can form the foundation for a serious true-love relationship has some issues they need to work on. This film has no plot to speak of and gives you no reason to care what happens to the characters or their made-just-outside-Hollywood relationship. That said, the acting is pretty good and the schtick with the angels concerned about their medical costs is funny. This movie had everything going for it and there are a lot of good scenes. The poor overall rating is not the fault of the cast or the writers. The basic concept is highly shopworn and the casual treatment of violence, class, sexuality, and power fails to achieve the biting edge that I've come expect from these wacky cynical GenX semi-indie postmodern comedies."
5,A Must-See!,"This is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen! Caneron Diaz and Ewan McGregor work great together! It's a really funny movie, you'll be laughing practically from beginning to end. This is definitely one you want to watch over and over again.My favorite!!"
5,Boyle salutes Capra,"While I really enjoyed Danny Boyles two previous films, I found Life Less Ordinary to be a great step towards breaking new ground. Boyle doged directing Alien 4 to participate in this project, and after seeing it I'm glad he did. It's roughly the same premise as It's a wonderful life, Angels need to set mortals straight, the execution however bends the rules and twists the story in ways that any viewer capable of higher brain functions and sick of any indie film getting by on four people in a car goes somewhere where someone gets killed will love the whole higher pwers, dark comedy, true love is never perfect humm this film has. Everyone is great, Ian holm and Stanley Tucci make great villans and Ewan McGregor and Cameron Diaz are so over the top that the film actually works. Give it a try."
4,Serendipity,"One of the most pleasant experiences in life, if you are a fan of movies, is to run across a film you cannot categorize, yet enjoy immensely, in fact all the more, for this quirk. Such a flick is ""A Life Less Ordinary."" The first time I saw it, I couldn't decide if I loved it or hated it. The second time I fell in love with it. The more times I see it, the more head over heels I become. Like the film itself, I would have to term this serendipity. Oh, that Hollywood, and everywhere films are made, would make more films that leave a smile on my face and wonderment at the serendipitousness (how's that for a word?) of life itself. How clever is God and His angels in their execution of imagination. Bravo!"
5,An unexpectedly good film :),"Honestly, I'm not a huge Cameron Diaz fan, so I really expected to watch for 10 minutes and then look for something else.This is honestly a really entertaining movie. I wouldn't call it 'the best' or anything, but if you are looking for something entertaining to burn an hour and a half of your time, this is perfect."
4,fun movie,"I first read a review of this film, when it was coming out in theaters, and I was intrigued at the concept. It wasn't until a couple of years later I that I rented the VHS and was greatly entertained. Not only is it a refreshing new idea of kidnapper/victim in a comedic slant; but playing the lead role was the up and coming Ewen MacGregor, who's talent at the time, was just being discovered. With venerable actors as Ian Holm and Holy Hunter, it was a treat to watch. It has the ""independent"" feel to a film, and delivers a refreshing new story with wonderful results. ... a great late night movie with that special friend. Enjoy!"
4,I was surprised but I liked it,"When the movie started I was ok what did I just rent but after the whole angel thing..it was actually good. I thought Cameron Diaz did a great job in this film. I have never seen that Edwin guy in any films and he is just as good. I loved the way they interacted together. Holly Hunter also did a great job being a ""bad"" angel while she was on the earth. Get this movie you will not be disappointed."
1,What the heck happened?,"Only goes to show, you can have very talented actors, a good script but if there is no chemistry between the two romantic leads you got one big goose egg on your face movie. Too bad."
2,bizaare movie,"This film never really knows where its going and to be honest it is a pretty terrible movie, although it is slightly saved by two good performances from Cameron Diaz and Ewan McGregor."
3,A film thats very Ordinary,"I'm affraid I have to disagree with the majority of people reviewing this film, but then hey - variety is the spice of life!! This film is a half hearted cross between Pretty Woman (though not as endearing), and Sleepless in Seatle (without the comedy). As a film to watch at home, its worth a hire, but theres no way that I would part with my money to actually buy this film. Cameron Diaz is as usual stunning, but Ewan McGregor shows none of the charm that made him great in Trainspotting.Watch it = yes Buy it = NO NO NO"
3,"not as cool as ""trainspotting""","When I bought ""Life less ordinary"" I expected something like ""Trainspotting"" (another movie by Danny Boyle). That's why I got the movie in the first place. However, it seems to fall way below ""Trainspotting"" in its plot. (Maybe girls and more romantic guys then me will think different though). That's why I gave it 3 stars - out of disappointment."
5,Awesome Media Player,"I was looking for an MP3 player the oter day and then I saw this one I was amazed once I saw all the features and I immediately bought it and once I got it I didnt regret my purchase. It surpasses the overestimated Ipod by a longshot. This MP3 plays MP4's and MP3's. It can view JPEG's and has some games loaded on it. The MP4's are of really good quality. They are not the best quality, but they are well above average. Another good thing about this MP3 is that the computer recognizes it as a mass storage device. Overall this MP3 player is a great buy."
3,Instructions worse than useless.,I spent some time researching before I purchased the YP-T8Z no where in the reviews was it mentioned that the instructions were written by sadists. After a couple of weeks of trial and error I am able to download pictures and some music. I am unable to get it to play music purchased over the internet and the instruction book has no info at all on that area.The player looks and feels nice. The music sounds very nice. Pictures are great.However the lack of any reasonable instructions make this a very very frustrating piece of equiptment.
2,"Instruction and software, worth a shiiittttt ..... ....","the device itself is very nice and packs interesting features,. The accompanying instructions and software, I bet that the peoples who developped it were working out of their backyard. It's simply worth a shiiitttt."
4,Needs better accessories,"Once you throw away the earphones, the manual and the lanyard, (replace the phones with something decent like Pro35s), it is a wonderful device. I would have given it 5 stars except for that. I listen to audio books while working out and it is so superior to CDs in its simplicity of use and compact size. Press one button to start, pause and stop, then start again where you left off... no CDs or batteries to change. Plays for 20 hours on one charge. I even found where to download books for free on the Internet. Get rid of your portable CD player and get into one of these."
4,Samsung MP3 Player,"I like the sleek and elegant design of this player. With the ability to play MP3s, listen to radio with many presets, view limited video and pictures and text files along with being a digital voice recorder, this model has many features for the price. My only real complaint is not with the player itself but with the file management software that comes with it. I have two Apple iPods but use them predominantly for podcasts. The Samsung media software does not aggregate many different media elements into one central location like iTunes does. I found it very difficult to find and download podcasts for this player. The sound quality is as good as Apple if not better, and for music, it may be just great. Due to this limitation of the software, I did not get as much enjoyment as others might. For me, it is an expensive digital voice recorder and FM radio. I did give it four stars because it has great potential and looks and sounds nice."
5,Super collection,"So much great music on these discs, so little time! Wonderful to hear the Medea excerpt sung by someone other than Callas (though I am a big fan). And sung magnificently to boot. Bravo!"
3,OK,"This book is an Ok book more work could have been done to pump up the tension. The characters had no feeling and where just rushed into the story. I enjoyed the action parts of the books which were well written but the parts in between were somewhat dry and boring.The book is about A P.I Hugh Merryck who is sent on a mission to find a man who could clear a past British ambassadors as a traitor. A very political book about west germany , FDR and Cia working in conjunction with British . Hugh Merryck looks for Otto Krasner and this finds him in New york by some luck and he falls in love with Krasner`s daughter .The book could have been more descriptive at times that is why i give it a three."
3,Hard knocks,In general I have found that Zoe Sharp's books a little too tough for me. Hard Knocks is no exception to that opinion.Linda Sheean
3,Overpriced,These tomatoes are fine. But they are also available in your standard grocery store (such as ShopRite) for $0.75 to $1.25
5,Classic Hagar '70s shot,"I first got this disc back in '89 and still think of it as one of Sammy's best. Chunky guitar rock like it ought to be. Sammy's music has always ranged from the rock anthem to the deep. Whether he's partying the night away with 'Turn up the music' or getting ready for the apocolypse in 'Crack in the world' Sammy's always done it with style and grace. This may not be the style that made Sammy hugely popular, but it is the sound that makes him a true legendary rocker. He may never be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, but he should be."

4,Beginner's book on quantum physics,A great book for beginners and enthusiasts on the subject of quantum physics/theory. Mr. Wolf provides clear well thought out examples of the various theories which support parallel universes and the implications they may have on this one. He also provides a brief description of the history of our understanding of the quantum world. This book is a must read for anyone who find themselves thinking just a bit differently than everyone else
3,A hard read for the general public,"I attempted to read this book about ten years ago and found it extremely complicated and hard to follow. I bought it again few weeks ago expecting that after all these years, and a couple of other books I have read on the topic could find it easier to read this time; however, it seemed as complicated and boring as the first time. Maybe someone with a strong science background would find it interesting. For anyone just wanting to understand the theory and it's implications it is definitely a hard read."
2,[Junky] book needs improvement,"I recently started reading books on theoretical phycics, so I am no expert in the field. Nevertheless I found the book quite intersting at times but it has one major flaw that is inexcusable: no illustrations. I guess the writer was purposely trying to confuse his readers; I mean, some parts were very easy to understand, written in layman's terms and giving good examples. However, there are parts in the book that NEEDED drawings. Also, the book tends to talk in circles."
1,"Can you say ""D-U-M-B-E-D D-O-W-N""?","I'm not surprised people are complaining there are no illustrations here. Perhaps it should come with pictures you can color in yourself and a complementary box of crayons. If we assume, however, for the sake of argument, that this is intended as a children's book, it is nevertheless a very poor children's book. (Very many authors, among them Lewis Carroll, E. B. White, and C. S. Lewis, have shown that it is possible to write for children and still write supremely well.)"
2,"Fair, but not for serious study","What this book attempts to do is describe why parallel universes could exist and the implications of those parallel universes. Not only one parallel universe but many, many parallel universes each of which interacts with your present. Most people would have no problem reading this book and coming away with an understanding of why the theory of parallel universes exists. That is the end of the value of this book... you know about the experiment that was the basis for the theory and how the theory explains that experiment.The remainder of the book is poorly written and hard to follow. The theoretical underpinnings are put forward and contradicted at various points.For those who want a very basic introduction, not about the theory of parallel universes, but about the experiment that started it all, this is as good an introduction as any other book that I have read. Not a read for someone who is actually trying to understand the theory and it's implications."
4,Not as smelly as the name suggests,"Actor Ann Magnuson and gonzo musician Kramer teamed up to provide some of the most hilarious and original music of the 90s. Found sounds, manipulated tapes, pop culture references, and readings of what sound like Magnuson's dreams float over the pot-stoked mayhem of Kramer's music, which ranges from the shimmeringly beautiful and trancelike ""Psychedelic Sewing Room"" to the hilarious and manic cover of Roky Erikson's ""Splash 1."" Chock full of idiosyncracy, humor, and a whimsical irony leavened with just enough earnestness to keep you from dismissing it as a joke."
5,2 stone-cold classics: the drum; too much sleep,"adam and eve in the garden of eden, under the influence of hard apple cider, this is psych-O-delic afterglow music. if there were any justice at all, The Drum and Too Much Sleep woulda been Top Ten AM radio hits. if you love Galaxie 500, then ask ol' Santa to stuff this bad boy in yer stocking."
1,Just to see whether I liked it,"Heard Aida long ago, except the march and ""Celeste Aida"", I remembered not liking it at all. But it's so popular, I thought I'd give it another try. Got this DVD for about $3 - paid too much. The entire disc is 80 minutes - didn't finish it, so don't know how much of that is commentary. Hated every note. Worst singing I ever heard outside a church. Colors and photography were beautiful."

2,It Stinks,"Seed of chucky soundtrack only has one good thing on it and It's Chucky singing any song on the soundtrack of cource I wouldn't know if even he does because I've never listened to the soundtrack I would but amazon won't let me or anyone else. Oh and if Jennifer tilley or if any of the charecter are drunk singing on the CD go them! So that's why It's my pleasure to say Buy the dvd, rent the dvd, go visit the web site then if your still up to it Buy the soundtrack so you can have triple the Chucky all you want.-stephanie Boal NJ"
2,Not made for a true sportsman,This watch is advertized with a stainless steel bezel and a mineral crystal. NOT TRUE They are both made of plastic. Bug spray such as Deep woods off or Cutter will disolve the crystal and bezel leaving you with a milky crystal and disolved bezel. This isn't a good watch for the outdoorsman or Ironman unless you work out indoors on a treadmill.I found out the hard way but still within 2 weeks of recieving it so Amazon returned it for credit. Thank you Amazon for the credit.(Update to review)Amazon has now changed the description to more accurately describe the watch.
2,Wrong product shown,We ordered these and they were made out of zinc although the photo shows nylon. The nylon version works great.
4,In Africa Hunting Adventures in the Big Game Country,A very entertaining and historically interesting African hunting book circa 1910. Different because it is by a writer who hunts instead of a hunter who writes. The only disappointment is that the many illustrations referred to in the text are not shown.
4,Good hunting history book,"This was an interesting book of how hunting was back when people had time to hunt in Africa.The author goes all over Africa, walking, riding trains, and even a horse cart and finally a car.If you want to read a book about hunting as it used to be in Africa, a hunt that took a long time, many animals, this is a good book to read.If you are not interested in hunting, then I would not suggest this book. It is a book about hunting."
4,Good read,"I hadn't read the previous book in the set but after reading this one it makes me want to find it. The characters (especially Sandy) have that gritty quality that makes them seem more real. They're not all smiles and love. The way that the author includes a bit of future history at the end (Aku the Great, etc. et al) and leaves Sandy out of it was an interesting twist. Just goes to show no matter how much you do, if you're not a favorite with the higher ups you don't get any credit. If the first is anything like this one then I'm sure to like it."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as a Name to Conjure With",Continuing adventures of a new gang of four. Poor editing makes for a somewhat disjointed read. Sets up a third book.
1,very poor,"This order that, I was sent was incompete all the items isn't here the items are not the same as the picture on screen when Iordered. The swimwear top is made for a baby weighing about 5lbs.no beach bag ,hat doesn't match swimwear like it showningin picture no beach shoes either."
1,DO NOT ORDER!,"There is obviously a problem with this item as I have just received it and like the other reviewers found that there is NO duffle bag, NO beach bag and NO changing mat all of which were cute items that I could have used after my daughter outgrew the swimwear. Also the hat is NOT the cute matching swim pattern it is plain pink. Altogether a very disappointing experience from amazon.com I thought their quality control would have been higher.. I am hoping that someone from amazon will contact me about the missing items and check into their supplier and either change the picture/contents of this item or discontinue it. I shop a lot online and have never felt duped before now, I did not expect a problem like this to get by amazon.com"
5,A Gothic Masterpiece,"There is no other word to describe this magnificent beautifully built album. Each and every song is a COF classic. This was the first Black Metal album I have ever heard, so I guess you could tell how I fell for it, and for COF. No esteemed Black Metal fan can have this album missing out of his list.One by one the songs unravel, revealing a full and vibrant Black Metal style with kickass guitars, killer drumming (it's a shame Nicholas left after this album), sepulchered voices by the one and only Dani Filth- plus bedazzling opera singing, organs, and violins- making this album thier gothiest one. A TRUE GOTHIC MASTERPIECE!!"
3,It suffers in the studio,"Cradle of Filth are the type of band that I really WANT to like. They have a style that is potentially unbeatable. But, that style needs to be augmented with great songwriting. In this area, Cradle of Filth is good, but not amazing. The drums also were absolutely butchered in the production. Nick Barker is a fantastic drummer, but sound-wise this was a disaster. Nevertheless it is a great listen if you're into this kind of stuff. You will enjoy it."
5,There is no beast without cruelty,"This is by far the best Cradle of Filth album I have ever heard. Dani's screeching is not what it used to be, but the guitars and keyboards along with the female vocals make Cruelty one of the best albums of the year."
3,decent...,"I can't possibly imagine what could make someone think that this is black metal or that this can seriously compete with Emperor and Opeth. It is a pretty good piece of metal, however the vocals are exaggerated to the point where its pretty much comical. Sounds like they carted in all of Santa's elves to do the singing. The main problem here though is that this tries way to hard to be ""evil"" but comes off as cheesy most of the time. The little notes below the photo of each group member in the booklet and the short spoken word segments throughout a few of the songs didn't give any sense of demonic presence or whatever they were striving for. If you want some real black metal then I'm sure Ihsahn and his band could be of a greater service then these guys. Hopefully you know which band Ihsahn is from however."
1,sellout,"why do these guys think they need a perfect production and a pop sound? Everything about this just sucks.I don't understand how anyone can appreciate the vocals. What about bands like satyricon? the vocalist from abigor and summoning is terrific. CoF were so great back in the Principle Of Evil Made Flesh days. this isn't black metal, that's for sure. If you want black metal, look at Satyricon, Emperor (In the nightside eclipse), abigor, or dissection."
1,__ D I T C H W A T E R !,"""Tales from the Crypt?"" Is that little skeleton the one singing in this band? This band has excellent musicians but the ""yappedy yap chihuahua "" sounding singer RUINS the whole CD. This album is badder than a Dirt Devil, Eureka, Hoover, Regina, Royal Maid....you get the picture."
2,Can't help sucking,"Cradle of Filth just can't help sucking. It's in their blood.Anyway, the beginning of the second song on this album is awesome. The rest suck butt.By the way, the song Sodomy and Lust is a cover from the band Sodom. (Sodom is much better than Cradle of Filth.)"
5,deliciously grim and raging evil!!!,"one of their 2 best albums, the other being V-empire. No, COF are not blackmetal nor did they ever claim to be and its embarassing to hear a metal fan state otherwise."
3,Enjoyable up to a point,"CoF sure can play - I love the ""bonus"" CD on which they cover material from other bands. And the closing techno thingie is truly comic. The main CD which tells the story of E Bathory is fine for a couple of runs through, then wears thin."
4,I would like to see more lesbian vampires....,"Usually I side with the purists who diss trendy wannabe music. Although on a global scale there's no way you could call this trendy, within the arena of black metal, well maybe. But, damn, there is just no one like Cradle of Filth. I especially love them in terms of imagery, atmosphere, and other intangibles. The only thing that gets me sometimes are those darn vocals. Egad! Just downright chilling sometimes. But it's the trademark of Cradle. And in comparison to other albums, I like this one the best. It's the most listenable for sure. So call be a bandwagon jumper."
2,"Filth, they've betrayed Black Metal Roots","they started as an Original black metal band with ""theprinciple of evil... but after that album, It was pretty clear Cradleof filth were going to turn to gothic. True black metal (bands like Immortal, old Satyricon, Graveland, Gontyna Kry, Ulver or Dissection) achieves a fearsome and ghoulish atmosphere, unlike this girlsih pretty dance. Dani's vocals are getting even more high pitched, unlike immortal's fierce growl, and looking at his present outfit he could as well be Marilyn manson. Traditional Black metal reminds you of the cold dark winter landscapes of norway and the mighty battles fought there, this reminds you of a broken dishwasher. Definitely I wouldn't call this Black Metal"
1,I Hate This Band!,"Cradle Of Filth is Filthy indeed! They can't play their instruments. The guitars don't even sound good, like rain falling down hard, and are neither heavy nor melodic. And that screeching is just awful! And why all the degrading of woman(I'm a guy)? Plus the imagery is gross! This is NOT heavy metal. Or music. Avoid this CD at all costs!"
1,Worlds worst video card ever,"My company purchased 9 machines with this exact card in them 18 months ago. Today I finished replacing number 7 of the original nine. For the last 3 months we have lost one every other week. To top it off, these machines have never seen 1 game. They are being used SOLELY as a print server.STAY AWAY FROM THIS CARD, STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!!"
5,Another Good Read,Maugham is a master of the easy read. His novels flow so easily but have an emotional bite. Once again he writes of the frail human condition but the protaganist tries to overcome her weaknesses. There are valid ideals in Maugham's novels that propel the reader to cheer for the opppressed. This book is no exception. Don't expect to be uplifted but you will be able to relate to the situation of Kitty. Well worth the time!
1,People who prefer not to edit,"This book is so full of typos and grammatical errors that it is unreadable. Period. I returned the book. Somebody, pay attention to what your product is!!"
5,Touching Tale,"A touching tale of love (or false love) and betrayal (adultery). The principal character, Kitty is flawed but grows in the story. We experience her revelations and development, and that is main-spring of this tale set in Hong Kong and China. It is all very credible. Maugham is simple and persuasive with his characters and narrative. There are no tricks or unnecessary meanderings.Maugham is the consummate story-teller. Story-telling, I feel has become a forgotten art and is becoming under-rated. Somerset Maugham has survived. Other authors peaked during his lifetime, but are becoming forgotten (like James Joyce or William Faulkner); except by esoteric college professors. Maugham has out-lasted many of his contemporaries."
4,Heartbreaking!,"The story begins with the very unlikable Kitty Fane. She is selfish, vain, and is bored with her husband. After an adulterous affair, Kitty travels with her husband to an area stricken by cholera.Kitty begins to work in the nearby convent while the nuns nurse those stricken with the disease. During this time, Kitty attempts to repair her broken marriage. Just when she begins to make amends, tragedy strikes. Kitty is left alone to face her demons.I enjoyed watching Kitty's character evolve throughout the story. I first noticed the change when she began embracing the orphans in her care instead of being repulsed by them. She begins to understand that, in the face of so much suffering, her problems are very small. Kitty begins to empathize with others and make better choices. In the end, Kitty is stronger than she realizes and her tragedy is really the beginning of a new life.I was captivated from the first page to the last."
3,I Liked the Movie Better...,"This is one of those books that is probably rated better if you haven't seen the movie with Edward Norton Jr. and Naomi Watts. The writing is effective but the problem was that I preferred the storyline of the movie over the book. Still, it's worth a read even if you have seen the movie because it fills the characters out nicely. The book portrays Kitty Fane's character more fully than others and seems to be written partly from her viewpoint.That being said, I adore the movie!The Painted Veil"
4,Movies vs. Novel,"I recently saw the 1930's original with greta garbo which is a must see for anyone reading this book. Still, the ending is quite different from the book. The newer version also doesnt include a reunion with her father. Both films fall short of this. I have to say that the Razors Edge on film was more faithful to the book. I guess directors in film dont like to see adaptations completely true to the novel."
2,Not a Good Book,"I found the story uninteresting and for the most part uneventful. The Painted Veil is about a one-dimensional, self-absorbed woman. She has an affair with man just like herself. She is married to a simple, self-restrained man who could prove interesting in the story but the writing stays with this boring woman. She has a few experiences that seem to change her and makes her aware that other people in the world exist and have feelings beside her.But alas, she proves to be the same self absorbed woman that she always was but with her new realization she now feels bad about it."
4,Can't wait to see the movie!,Very interesting and enjoyable book to read. Can't wait to see the movie that's coming out this month!!
3,Perhaps I was spoiled having read other Maugham work first,"Maugham's prose is often beautifully facile and his subtle efforts to place his characters carefully into scenes are often brilliant. Such is the case here, at least for the first 3rd of the book. The author invested a great deal of time and effort into developing the characters and plot. I can't escape feeling that 3/4 of the way through this story, Maugham found some distraction that he preferred to finishing this novel and simply dashed off an ending to free up his time and attention.That said, I admit to possibly being spoiled having read The Razor's Edge first.And I would still encourage readers to pick up The Painted Veil.Afterall, my opinion is just that...my opinion!"
2,A stained jewel,I bought this book 40 years ago. I loved it then and still enjoy reading it.It's a wonderfully written book.Now that I've just bought the Kindle Reader I wanted to have it in my Kindle collection at my disposal.To my dismay the Kindle edition has many typographic errors. Most of the comments by the nuns in French are ill copied.There are besides numerous mistakes in English.A simple ortographic revision with a text processor would have sufficed to correct them.I don't think it's fair to charge for a faulty product.
3,Sometimes the movie is better...,"Somerset Maugham wrote from a particular period, and his work clearly revealed bruised and conflicted emotion within the scope of his plots. Nonetheless, compared to the movie (featuring Edward Norton as Walter, the epidemiologist), there is a more even-handed treatment of the marital issues between Kitty and Walter. The movie ended with Kitty's new-founded, mature love for her husband that lent this character dignity, which the book fails to do. Maugham's ""Painted Veil"" doesn't flesh out human foibles so much as it harshly indicts sheltered, young women of the wealthy class who were socialized to view their role in life through romanticized notions of marriage and childbearing. ""The Painted Veil"" is a ""period book,"" lucidly written and solidly plotted. Yet the movie brings to life the horrifying backdrop of cholera and the believable, dramatic transformation of its main characters."
1,ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS,"ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!!!"
1,camera review,"This camera didnt last more than a day, bought it for my 11year old daugter, she plugged it into computer to download pictures and the camera started smoking and will not turn back on!! It was a total waste of money, very dissapointed, just glad it didnt screw my computer up!!!"
1,Not a good camera,"I bought this camera as a christmas gift for my boyfriend. The camera takes wonderful pictures, but it only takes 3-4 pictures at a time before it needs new batteries. We bought a new box of brand name batteries thinking we just had some previously used batteries, but the same thing happened! We even tried different brands, but nothing helped. Rechargable batteries were even worse. We are in the process of contacting the manufacturer to see what can be done about this problem.Bottom line: Don't buy this camera unless you have a lot of money to throw away on batteries."
2,bad and different Russ Meyer's films,"Wild Gals is the worst film Meyer did by far. Unwatchable. Blacksnake is not bad, just completely different from the average Russ Meyer film. Doesn't look like any other of his films."
5,"Fantastic recipe book, with many extras.","What a great recipe book. Not only does it have an astounding variety of wonderful recipes, but the pictures and other content accompanying them are entertaining as well.30~ years ago, around the time that this came out, my dad's ex-wife Marta bought him a copy. He treasured it, not only for sentimental reasons, but for the book itself. Some time in the past year, it was stolen from us, presumably by one of our roommates.He was disappointed by losing it, Father's Day is rolling around, and I love a good oceanic meal, so this was an obvious choice for a gift!He hates it when we kids spend a lot of money on him, but this was more than low enough to please him. I paid $12 for an absolutely flawless copy of this book. The only damage was inflicted by me; I made a tiny tear in the book sleeve when I was putting it back in its packaging.I can't wait to give it to him, and until then, it makes for great skimming material."
3,not to bad,good book pretty fast delivery only problem it didnt come with a jacket but its not that big of a deal cant beat the price paid for the book.
1,EMPTY NOT FULFILLING LIKE HER OTHER CD'S,"TRY ""18 HEARTBREAKING SONGS"" OR ""THE BEST OF TIMI YURO "" THIS COMPILATION DOES NOT COMPARE TO SHOWCASING HER REAL TALENT AND WONDERFUL VOICE. GREAT CD PHOTO THATS ABOUT IT:(("
3,Rather Dissapointing,"I bought this video because I wanted to see Tom Sizemore in a starring role (apart from the ""Relic""). Though both stars are known for their abilities, they seemed like guests in the film. Awkward acting, and poor directing. The ending is very good, at least we have some reactions from the cast, bun in conclusion, I wouldn't judge TS by this movie. He is a lot more than he seems to be in this one. Definitely recommended for his fans, truly handsome and with lots of sensual scenes."
2,Very Poor Quality Marvin,"Of course Marvin is one of the greatest R&B artists of all time, and his fans will likely be happy to have any of his music on video. I have hundreds of music videos from the 70's, 80,s and 90's I have collected over the years by countless artists. However, I have purchased several DVD concerts and find most of them to be of very poor quality in video and sound. This one is no different. It seems that the producers are just throwing any video concert into the market without caring about the quality, just to make a dollar. The result is ""music lovers"" are repeated being burned by lousy quality concerts of their favorite artists. If you are not going to remaster the video for the current techology, then its a waste of money."
3,Strictly for beginners,"All potential readers be warned: this book is only suitable for very early beginners, people starting from absolute scratch on the topic. It is very clear and concise (I read it in a single afternoon) but you are not going to find in-depth discussion of anything. Also I'd like to make it clear that the book talks about ALM in banks only (no insurance companies, pension funds, endowments etc).So, if you are very ignorant but curious, this book is for you (possibly buy it used, it's not cheap). If you already know the basics of ALM, my advice is to buy something else."
4,"Cool Phone, great features but a few minor setbacks",if you are really into thin phones.. this is the one for you (thinner than razor) but you'll have to sacrifice functions such as short batt life (approx 36hrs on standby w/ a few calls)and soft speakerphone volume...and for some you have to get used to the keypad.
2,"Nice phone, but flat keypad is a pain to use","I just got this phone a few days ago to replace my broken SonyEricsson Z520a. I'm attracted to this Samsung because of the thin form factor and pretty impressive spec.But the first time I used it, I was totally disappointed. My biggest complaint is the flat keypad. The keypad doesn't give you enough tactile feedback when you press it. And for some reasons some keys are harder to press than the others. This really annoys me since I text message a lot.Other than the keypad, this is a very nice phone. The screen is high resolution (320 x 240) and very bright. IMHO the user interface is not as intuitive as Sony Ericsson's.I tried Bluetooth on this phone and was able to transfer my phonebook from my laptop without a hitch.But for me, the keypad is the killer. That's the reason I rated it 2 stars. This phone is going back to Amazon for sure."
4,Success is entertainment,"Fred Astaire is at his best again. It is only the story of successful ambition, a success based on nothing but hard work and willpower. This film is made very attractive by the side-kick of a brother Fred Astaire has in the film, and all the funny situations the couple creates and gets entangled in. The fight for success is transformed into some kind of adventure full of fun and pleasurable moments.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
3,second chorus,"If you're looking for a classic Astaire and Rogers movie this is not it. But there is something here worth hearing and seeing.This is one of those swing era films that can be of real interest to someone who loves the music and musicians of that time. In this movie Astaire and Burgess Meredith are dueling trumpet players. The sound track has the trumpet playing of Billy Butterfield and Bobby Hackett. Also there is the best band of the era, Artie Shaw.This can be a very rewarding film, if you look and listen for what it really has to offer."
2,Skip this movie.,"Bad. The songs are only okay, and the dances are pretty bad for Fred Astaire. Astaire later said it was the worst movie he ever made. I agree with him 100 percent."
2,Simply sad,"I usually love Fred Astaire movies eventough they are lacking the the plot area, but this one is the worst. The only memorable song is ""Would You Like to be the Love of My Life"", the dancing isn't anything to rave about (infact there isn't much), and the quality of the picture itself is poor. When the movie ends you sit there thinking ""what was that?"" IF you want to see a Fred Astaire film see Top Hat or Easter Parade, but not this, it is depressingly bad."
4,enjoyed reading this with my 7 year old,"My 7 yr old and I are studying Ancient Greece, and I came upon this book in the library. It is a story about a 13 year old boy in Ancient Greece and how he winds up participating in the Olympics. It's a fiction story, but it includes a lot of information about the Olympic Games and their history. It was very enjoyable and informative reading."
3,Ok I guess,"It is a cover,and it is cheap enough. But there is no kind of door on it, and there's no really good place to put the lights required for a desert animal without melting plastic."
4,Coding made simple,"Since I switched to Linux, finding a good IDE was hard. Until I found this. If you know your way around a programming language, then I recommened this. It will make your coding projects abit easier to manage and faster to do."
3,Go Ahead and look back,"I am a NATALIE COLE fanatic. I have al of her albums in both CD and LP form, save for a few. So of course I alredy love the album, but from a non-natlie cole fan, they might be dissapionted. My favorite song is a ballard, entititled ""Paradsie"" the second track. It reaslly captures Natalie's sooth and refine vocals. The title track ""Dont look back"" was also another great track with a more R&B/pop type theme. ""Cole-Blooded"" is a song where natalie tries to dapple in the rock type pop and somewhat suceeds. The cd has good pionts and some non-natalie cole fans would like it but this is not one of her best."
4,Pocket Edge Knife fits my lifestyle,"Since I am outdoor often, you never know when you need a pocket knife like this. The serrated edge gives me the cut I need when I am doing various yard work or on carpentry projects. I am usually the one that is being asked if I have my pocket knife with me with a house project is going on at my son-in-law's house. His birthday is coming up and this will be an item I purchase for him. You can rely on Gerber products."
3,Not crazy about it...,Nice sharp knife but it is a pain to get open and close. Whether you use tab or studs it is still difficult. Closing is also a challenge. I like a good frame lock but this is difficult to disengage. I ended up buying a knife to replace this.
1,Stiff mechanism and poor ergonomics,"This blade just doesn't feel comfortable in the hand, and the mechanics are such that you have to apply pressure to the thumbstud at an odd angle to get the blade to open. Even then, the mechanism sticks more than you'd expect on a fresh out of the box knife.I switched to a Gerber Instant, and it was a much better designed product, which opened when force was applied at a natural angle along the line of my thumb."
5,great safety features,"Very handy, good size and easy to lock and unlock. My husband delivers packages and sometimes must open them...this was a good one for him!"
3,gerber knife,"semplice, discreto, buona brunitura,comodo da trasportare grazie al clip, piccolo ma tagliente.tutto ok ma forse prezzo un po' eccessivo per le dimensioni piccole"
3,Do Some Research,"First off, this knife was (mostly) worth the $20. The blade was razor sharp straight out of the box, the finish and grip handles were perfect, etc. That said, THIS KNIFE IS TINY! Both the blade and handle are just big enough for my hand to wrap around with little room left, and I have small, stubby sausage fingers. This knife will work well for cutting small objects, frightening tweakers that are too methed out of their minds to notice how small this sumbitch is, and for (eventually) opening the box on your new knifethat will hopefully be bigger than this one."
5,best metal band the in world,got this cd 2 months ago its out of control funny the fast beats crazy sh#t they say its awesome i would give it 100 stars if i could get this cd you will love it one more thing give it to your mom for mothers day
4,The Best,I had the pleasure of having both Professor Broom and Dr. Dozier while in school. Great book for the topic.
5,person who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge and survived...,"Tuli Kupferberg's first solo release with side one of Tuli & Friends... ""an album of Popular Poetry, Pop Poetry. Real Advertisements. As they appeared in newspapers, magazines, in direct mail, a company info bulletin, as a schoolroom flyer. No word has been added. Parts of some have been repeated. Parts of some omitted. But these are the very texts. These are for real!"""
4,Great family card game!,"We got this for our 7 and 8 year old boys for Christmas, and it's a great game! They had a lot of fun playing it, and it's a neat little concept. As an adult I would prefer a little more to it, but for children it's just right. I'd also prefer more cards so the game lasts a little longer. We played a full game in about 15 minutes, which is fine, but a longer game would have been better."
3,unimpressed,I was hoping for a much easier game to play with my kids. It sounded interesting enough and I thought it would be a good choice but the instructions (to me) are not the greatest written and I don't really understand what to do.
5,This game is great,Though it is complicated game to learn it is tons of fun. The only downside is there are tons of rules to remember. But after you've played it enough you kind of master the game and you learn strategies that can help you win. It is great fun.
4,Fun game,This is a fun game but has a lot of complicated instructions. Even with 3 adults it was hard for us to figure it out. We still haven't got it all the way. We also are disappointed that we can't make potions.
5,my favorite!,"I am old-fashioned, so I love the fact that Charms offers a whole box of the original flavored Blow Pops. This is one of the small things in life that make me very happy!"
2,Boring!!!,I found myself wondering if this book was ever going to end. I was more than half done when I stopped to consider not finishing it at all. Maybe because it was a series and this was the first I read but I didn't feel connected to anyone in the book. I found the pace extremely slow and the police characters depressed and depressing. This was not a fun read for me.
3,Gore galore,"Fifth Woman is a gripping read, and Kurt Wallender is a surprisingly sympathetic protagonist. Mankell does a good job of placing the characters in a clearly drawn milieu that does recall the Sjowall/Wahloo Martin Beck mysteries of the 1960s and 1970s.To me, however, the book just seems too violent and vivid to be a really good police procedural. The serial killings at the center of the plot are barbaric and complicated; they remind me of the movie ""Seven"" in their stagy nature.Those incongruities aside, I found the book to be an intelligent and absorbing thriller. You will certainly impress your friends by carrying this book around in your briefcase."
3,"good story, characters are under-developed....","Like ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" lots of details in the writing, but unlike that successful novel, not enough details in the characters. I really found myself unable to get inside the main character's head. The writing seems a tad rudimentary. The author lacks the skill to develop relationships between the characters. For these reasons, I found myself unable to commit to the book, even though the story had a lot of promise."
5,great writer,"You get so much out of the Kurt Wallander series. Henning Mankells writing is tip top, his characterisations are superb, in Kurt you see a man whose life has been ruled and in a way destroyed by his successful career as a detective. You see the what ifs of the man and you also see why he does what he does. This is dark, scandanavian crime writing at it's best, and i love it. I think if you like ian rankin then you'll love henning mankell"
5,Masterpiece,"Again and again Henning Mankell gives us a masterpiece. His terrific novels are not for the thrill-seekers and people with short attention span. His plots unrevel slowly and sometimes painstakingly, as I would imagine real investigations do.There are blind alleys and insecurities, and detectives are tired and occassionaly cranky. He is not only an exceptional mystery writer, but his astute assessment of our troubled times have accuracy of so-called serious novelists. Mr. Mankell manages the improbable, he excites and depresses us in the same time. Quite a feat for a mere scribbler of crime books."
3,Not My Favorite Wallander,"I generally very much enjoy the Wallander Mysteries, but must admit that this one left me cold. While a certain degree of Nordic stoicism is expected, the chilly atmosphere conjured up in this novel made reading a bit of a slog, despite a murder placed here and there throughout.Fans of the Wallander stories should read it because even a bad Wallander is OK and nobody wants to skip the chronological order of these novels. However, those who've never read any of this series are recommended not to start with this one."
3,Fifth Woman has suspense but lacks punch,"Master writer but even the title seemed a bit obscure. I gobbled up every word but at the end there was something missing. Was that something sex, violence, voice, the tone? I'm almost 63 and am sometimes forgetful but there was a certain forgettable quality to this book. I would call it well writen, creative, interesting yet there was a missing POWer. Once as a juror, I listened at the end of a trial as the prosecuter explained that he can't give every detail or evidence proved like in a drama. It was something like that with Fifth. The main character is smart enough, certainly ""real"" enough but I just didn't seem to care enough. It was sad when he loses someone close to him but I didn't get teary and neither did the m.c. in my opinion. Of course he was preoccupied with a serial killer but...I seem to be rambling so I'm going to stop but the biggest mystery to me was why the clever characters and plot just didn't really get to me."
3,I love Wallender....but too long....,"I'm a fan of Henning Mankell. I think The Dogs of Riga is a great crime novel. The Fifth Woman carries on the Wallender tradition but unlike The Dogs which is tight and fast paced, The Fifth Woman is long winded. It's a 100 pages too long. As much as Skane needs Wallender, Mankell needs a better editor to cut the fat."
2,Dull...,"I stumbled across this after I was enthralled with the brilliant The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, so I thought I'd give another Swedish mystery/thriller a try. I wanted to like it, the set up is intriguing. But it is just too dull. After about halfway through I just couldn't pick it up anymore. the author writes everything so matter-of-factly that all drama or tension is filtered out completely. Also the book is far too long. I'll just read something else while biding my time until Girl Who Played With Fire comes out."
2,The Fifth Woman,I will not purchase any more books by this author. The author jumped around too much and went into too much detail on things that really didnt matter to the reader. The story was dragged out to much. The plot was interesting and could have been a great book if written better.
2,Did NOT Enjoy,"Was I reading the same book as those who described this mystery as a 'gripping thriller'? There was nothing gripping or thrilling about this book. I did not think the character of Kurt Wallander was developed at all and so I did not feel I understood him or liked him. But in fairness this is the first Kurt Wallander mystery I have read and so perhaps his character was developed earlier in the series. However, it was an effort to finish this 400+ page book. No surprises at all in the end, in fact I kept saying to myself 'why don't the detectives figure that out?'. I did not like the style of writing and found it very choppy. I was fed up hearing about the rain, it was raining, it was going to rain, would it rain. I am amazed at all the five star reviews."
2,Plodding procedural-- the Detective is pooped and so am I,"Detective Kurt Wallander is professionally cautious and thoughtful (dull), personally abrupt, a bit on the insensitive side. Wallander struggles to accept his father's death, and wonders if he can build a new life for himself, maybe remarry, maybe buy a house and a dog. He philosophizes a bit about the apparent rise of violent crime in Sweden. It crosses his mind more than once to give up police work.This is probably more realistic than many detective stories, because there's no Sherlockian detection going on-- just a roomful of cops going over a collection of facts they've gone over more than once already. They're tired. They haven't had any sleep. You really feel their fatigue. And it takes the cops forever to notice clues, long after Mankell has revealed them to the reader. I wanted to scream, ""Open the drawer!!! Would you look in the freakin' desk drawer!!!"" and the like."
2,the fifth woman,I did not enjoy this book as much as some of the others such as the White Lioness for instance.
3,Interesting mystery but too long and plodding at times,This is a well-crafted mystery with a good plot that keeps the suspense up. Unfortunately the writing is pretty average which makes it a very tough read. There is a lot of unnecessarily repetitive text which adds to the length of the book. Somehow I managed to complete it and that's when I discovered that this was an English translation of the original Swedish version. That probably explains why in spite of a good plot this book failed to deliver completely.
2,Forget it!,"I found this ponderous at times - I wish it had been shorter and more suspenseful.Mankell includes extraneous details that furthers neither the plot nor the characters. At times I wondered if Ireally cared about the characters - it seemed as if there was not a lot happening in the so called mysteryand not a lot happening in Wallender's life - it would have helped if Mankell had keptWallender worried about his lady love and if we heard more from his daughter. Itseemed occasionally we would hear about them but they weren't important enoughto Wallender - and I know he was thinking about the investigation - but suspenseis crucial I think in mysteries and I didn't think the suspense was well sustained.Frankly, this was too long for what happens in the plot and the characters' lives; Mankellseems to have padded out his book to sell it for more $$."
4,Great storyteller,It seems to me that the stories move faster as newer ones are published. As long as they keep improving I shall keep reading them.
2,Builds you up to a big fizzle,"The book itself is alright, if you dont mind the author's bland, verbose, and tedious writing. But be prepared for a big letdown because the ending of the book is one of the worst I've ever read. I wish someone had warned me, so I'm warning others. I like the characters, but the book doesnt flow fast at all and it really fizzles in the end with no climax, and it was a big dissappointment."
2,Kind of disappointed,"Reading these two novels was like watching two lousy chess games by a low IQ player cursing all the time with dirty words and tough talks. Very bad scenarios with stupid and unprofessional characters in pretentious and inplaucible plots. Rucka should change his main character's occupation since he was not capable in the protection business at all, and talking tough with lot of ""fucks"" or ""fuckings"" won't help these characters a bit. The stupidity of these pathetic roles sometimes even caused anger and frustration during reading. Making two SAS teams hiring by a divorced US couple was even ridiculous, and the development of the sequel and its ending were neither believable nor logical. Almost all of the characters in these two books were either stupid or unprofessional. Rucka should improve himself first to write his specified profession stories. Very disappointed and hated to be fooled by the blind praises"
4,"Initially offputting, ultimately rewarding","I found _Human Voices_ harder to ""get into"" than the other four Fitzgerald novels I've read. And it seemed to have more stock characters. However, it ends more convincingly (less abruptly) than some of her other novels. Having survived wading through the acronyms, I came away feeling that there is more substance in this novel than there seemed to be while I was reading it. Almost by the way, it provides a compelling portrait of life in London early in the war and insight into how the English held on as they expected a Nazi invasion during 1940. Fitzgerald has a great gift for making human foibles simultaneously funny and touching."
1,Pointless.,"This book was just pathetic. I did not care about the characters. They were one dimensional and revealed nothing. This book seemed like a rough draft, and ended abruptly killing off a character for no reason. Completely pointless. I would give it zero stars if I could."
1,A disappointment,"The only reason I forced myself to plow through this book to the end (after having started it for the second time), was because of the glowing reviews, and because I had bought it and didn't want to waste my money. With the exception of a few clever phrases, it lacks all of the qualities which make for a good novel: character development, continuity, tension, plot. The overuse of acronyms is disruptive, and the typeface is difficult to read. The best thing about this book is that it's blessedly short."
5,I love Nouwen's writing....,"His writing is easy to read and understand, and he seems to be able to put his experiences and things he has learned in ways that i can relate to! I've read several of his books and never fail to be blessed by them."
2,Disappointed,I am a fan of Henri Nouwens writings and to me it was obvious this wasn't put together by him. It just didn't have Mr. Nouwens touch.
2,For conoisseurs only!,"As a non native English speaker and a former student in languages, I consider myself a pretty good speller. But I know that some people find English spelling really frightening. Unfortunately this is not a book for them.It is for people who master well enough the language and can make distinctions between various forms and spellings of English. Even those who think they are excellent at spelling, can still take a look at some of the exercises. You might find out that there are still words you don't know how to write them correctly.And for those of you who still have a long way to go to master the English language, get a good grammar book and don't worry too much: Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Emily Dickinson had similar problems, just to name a few personalities."
4,Great for everyone,"This book is great for everyone from the beginner to the seasoned sales forecaster.I browse it every now and again to remind myself that there are fundamentals to this business, and we know how costly veering from those can be.It's a fast read, and I highly recommend it to those doing site selection."
3,The Site Book,"The statement in another's review and in the content of the book:""A software package is offered for sale that provides templates and performs calculations..."" is not true. Tangram Corporation who used to sell the ""model"" no longer exists and I couldn't find the file anywhere when I searched for it online. The other reviewer's statement: ""However, if you are handy with Excel, you should be able to recreate the template/calculations within a few hours. "" may be true, but what is your time worth? If the model is worth re-creating, great!, but in this digital age, a web address for a download in ""the next edition"" would be really helpful. The book is a little dated but OK for a quick survey for the real estate professional (read broker or real estate manager, not necessarily research professional) who wants a quick list of top-of-mind location concepts."
1,Disappointed,"From an investor's viewpoint the book offers very little. At most you pickup some buzz words when marketing property. Very small book and can easily be read in one evening. There's a big void for this information and I haven't been able to find any published books to help me. If you know of any excellent books, please let me know by commenting.The book discusses a lot of terminology, but doesn't tell you how to do your own demorgraphic reports and give you any templates on how to prepare facts sheets that for marketing your property."
4,Etro Bath Gel,Tried this for the first time when I was staying at the Eden Hotel in Rome and got hooked. The fragrance from the gel lingers and often I don't need to put perfume after the shower. It smells fresh and I've had many people ask me what fragrance I was using as they find it unique and very nice.
1,Popper?,"Popper rules the Amazon roost. Nonetheless, Popper is guilty of willful misreadings.Intellectual dishonesty ought to be a capital offence in the ""Open Society""..."
4,It's all I need,"A register machine that allow me to control my stock (until 1200 items) and receivables, easy to install and use. Share data with my computer and for a realy affordable price. I definitively recomend to a small to medium business store! The weak point is that no adhere to fiscal rules in Brazil but no other made outside the country adheres too, exept the ones made here. Your use in Brazil is restricted to companies registered to pay govern taxes by estimatives (""Simples""). My overall evaluation is such a very good product."
4,Mr. Palfrey of Westminster,"This is a rather low-key spy/counter espionage series, but very enjoyable. No gun fights or bloody battles, just a thoughtful approach and success. We enjoyed it very much and look forward to more of Mr. Palfrey."
4,Good Series,I'd never heard of this series before. I was pleasantly pleased. It held my interest and is non violent.
2,Low Budget,"This is a low budget mystery non-thriller. On the positive side, there's no sex or violence. Indeed, there isn't much action to speak of at all. The plots involve little more than the tedious succession of characters that, at the end, turn out to be someone else. Try reconstructing the plot after you've seen it crash into its inevitably boring climax.The photography is wretched, with many face shots almost into the nostrils and lots of traffic scenes to pad out the required time. A little white spot appears in the upper right hand corner of the screen for several minutes at a time. I don't blame the photographers for that, however. That would require ingenuity.The hero is barely more than a faceless bureaucrat, his sidekick might be a zombie (and how about that wig!), and the comic relief focuses on an office worker who doesn't work much! Music? Was there any? The directing is strictly on the amateur side. In short, save your money or watch Frost, Morse, and Gently over again."
1,Mr Pelfrey in Westminster,"I like British minsteries, but cannot recommend this series. It is long winded and slow and very crude. Don't waste your money!"
2,A Legal Thriller That Doesn't Focus On The Issues.,"""The Chamber"" is a poorly written thriller thatpretends to be serious. The plot is so small, that it's bloated to thepoint where it uses the subject of racism as nothing but the elements of entertainment. This film doesn't show racism for what it is, sure it shows the KKK as criminal, secret and venomous, but those have always been it's selling points. ""The Chamber"" would work better if it tossed away racism because it doesn't make it into an issue here, only into a form of entertainment like the entertainment we get off of Rambo or a Schwarzennegger flick. How disappointing that instead of raising real thought-provoking issues, ""The Chamber"" is just boring and uninteresting. And to think that idiot John Grisham actually wants to take Oliver Stone to court over a great movie that does raise issues and serves as a satire of society: ""Natural Born Killers."""
4,Passable.,This film is really only good for two things.1. Chris O'Donnell appears without his shirt on for one scene2. Faye Dunaway plays a crazy drunk (ultimate camp!)
3,What Is Justice? What Is Evil?,"There are few clearcut issues in life, and Grisham explores so many gray areas in The Chamber. Can a truly evil man be remorseful and transformed? Is justice sometimes inappropriate, too harsh or excessive? Gene Hackman gives a tremendous portrayal as a racist slimeball sentenced to the gas chamber for a horrific hate bombing in the 60's, where Jewish twin boys were blown to bits. The movie describes all the legal maneuvering to keep him from his date with the executioner. Is Hackman a changed man? Does he regret his actions? Is he remorseful? Is he foolishly and blindly protecting someone? Is it in society's best interest to kill him some 30 years after his crime? These are the moral questions that swirl around inside the Chamber. The answers are up to you........"
4,Great book. . . great movie,"Seldom does the movie compares with the book, but in this one it does. It shows how our society has changed and the impact it has on people like the character in this movie. It shows how the political-correctness aspect of how we think and do things has an impact on our lives. I actually felt sorry for this racist murderer, but realize, that he was a product of a society, at that time, condonned such things and incouraaged them, only to do a flip-flop that left some, like the character on death-row wondering: What the hell happened?"
2,what was the screen writer thiinking,"Of all the movies made from John G books this was the only one I did not like.First it was the one book John G wrote that dragged as I read itand two the screen writer changed so much stuff,it lost the things John G was trying to say.In hind sit the screen writer should have sat on the main charactors lap during the last scene"
3,Very good plot.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, if nothing else, to the movie. Al Pacino is great, and when Adam Cayhall shoots down all the monsters from mars, let me tell ya, you could watch it over and over again. I don't want to give away any secrets, but the highspeed eighteen wheeler chases across a busy highway in on coming traffic.... that takes you buy the throat and swings ya around, squeezing harder and harder and never letting go until it snaps, and your head falls down onto your chest, (because theres nothing holding it of course!) and snaps your collarbone with it... it splinters into many peices within your body. Anyway... I just would like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, and In my opinion, this was the best war movie yet."
2,The Chamber Pot,"I would advise anyone who plans to read Grisham's spell-binding book, The Chamber, to see the movie first. Then read the first rate book. The actors were all fine. Worth watching Chris O'Donnell. But, it was hard to believe how the screenwriter mangled the story. And the casting. . .did they really expect anyone to believe Faye Dunaway as Adam's aunt. Please. She could have played his grandmother, who wasn't in the book but what difference does that make? The story was so convoluted, I half expected the governor to give the (not nearly skinny enough)Gene Hackman a Stay of Execution. Not a totally bad movie; but very disappointing."
3,a good yarn,"I liked the mystery and I stayed interested. However, I wish there were more clues to the perp while reading. The guilty party, in my opinion, came out of the blue. I liked the writing style and grammar. I didn't have to go running to a dictionary with each page. Overall, I enjoyed the mystery."
5,One of the best in the series,"This book is perhaps the best of the series. You start off with the introduction of Janessa into the series, Toby's love child that he was unaware of. AFter exploring how the family deals with its new-found child, and the culture shock involved, you have a Hot Story...The Chicago Fire of 1871.This novel's portrayal of the Great Fire is tremendous. One gets the adrenaline and fear of what a massive fire can do just by reading this book. It is a rush and hard to put down.Definitely recommended."
5,Good Book,One of the most interesting novels in the Toby Holt era of the series. I loved all the details and really learned a lot about the Chicago fire. It's interesting to note that this is the first one not written by Noel B. Gerson because he had died recently
1,Not for fans of their first 2 albums.,"If you were a fan of the first two albums of this band and were expecting more of the same on this album, let me save you time, money, and disappointment. This incarnation of the band bears almost no resemblence to what came before.The band retooled their sound for this album and jettisoned the sociopolitical fare for more standard r&b; fare and the result is something foreign to their former sound.Now, that wouldn't make this a bad album. post-funk synth r&b; was dominating the landscape at the time and this was clearly an effort to stay relevant at a time dominated by Al B. Sure, Keith Sweat, etc.What makes this a bad album is the quality fo the songs. There's not a single song on this album that sounds good, and that's before all the cheesy synth-funk aged it. If you listen to this album without ever having heard any other Bus Boys music it would still strike you as a horrible, horrible mistake."

4,A bargain!,"I enjoy this disc. The soprano is awful and the chorus could be a little more prominent in the Coronation Scene but overall it is a very solid performance. The bass portraying Boris is outstanding, especially in the death scene. The tenor singing Dmitri is also good. (I think both are Russians.) The work by the orchestra and the sound quality of the disc are both fine. For those who only need 73 minutes of BG in their CD collection, this version will fill the bill."
1,Hard to use,It doesn't come with any instructions. I have Windows 7 and the software that comes with it won't sync with the Palm. I have been trying to find out what kind of SD card I can use in it. The SD card I purchased won't register.
2,"Compared to V, it bites.","Sorry. This device ain't all that. The V was a breakthrough device and while Palm has gone a long way to improving the display, adding some smart features (instant clock thingie, vibrating alarm, etc.), it just can't live up to its marketing. The OS doesn't support the SD in any useful way, as do no applications. You don't get more for your money, you just get disappointed. It's faster and has better battery life, but come on--the new iPaq device is a complete stunner and so is the Handspring Treo. What's up in Santa Clara boys?"
2,PalmOne,"This Palm is not color screen. The screen is not bright enough. There is no bluetooth nor infrared, only cable. I'm not very happy with this item."
1,A total disappointment - I threw it away,"This product never worked properly, had limited functionality, and isn't even worth the discount price it's now available at."
2,So Where's the Stylus,"Purchased from Amazon 2001 in Florida. My Palm m505 arrived shortly after I ordered it, however there was no stylus as advertised and the software was pirated from the original on a used CD in a dirty case - did you think I wouldn't notice the ""M505 driver"" handwritten across the CD in magic marker? Also this Palm arrived dead as a doornail and had to be recharged. So nice of you to send the cradle you promised. Now I'm off to buy a stylus and a manual, since the software contains nothing in the way of startup and care instructions for this thing."
5,Palm m500 - One Hot Item !,Can't say how much much back and forth thinking about Palm OS and Vx vs. Pocket PC (and Microsoft's Win CE)I've done in the last year. I'm so glad I waited. The day I finally decided that the market momentum that Palm had was more important than the technological gains that MS had via CE (and the fact that it bothered me that memory/processor comarisons between the two devices were often presented by the press as an apples > apples comparison - when it of course wasn't). The day I decided to go with a Palm Vx - I discovered that Palm was introducing the m500 and m505. I changed my order and am now awaiting the m500. Best of all possible worlds (with msWord/Excel and SD/MMC expansion card functionality).
3,Check your palm for faults,"I recently bought and then returned a palm m500. I have beenusing palm Vx for almost three years. I decided to upgrade tom500 but I was dissapointed when I received my m500. I thought it would be as problem-free as Vx but I was wrong. The biggest problem I had with m500 was its digitizer. My recommendation for those who plan to buy palm is to check it to make sure it functions properly. If you can afford, buy a Clie which has a lot more features than any palm out there can have."
4,Thin and neat,"I had a perfectly good IIIxe running Palm OS 3.5, but it was so bulky. This fits better into a shirt pocket (although it is still just a bit big for this) and is therefore more portable for me. The recent price reductions have made this a real bargain!"
1,Poor Quality Control,Should have gave more thought to ordering this unit after reading other reviews. Unfortunately I got a dud and had to return it. Not going to try again! Would not charge or power up.
1,Not what it is cracked up to be,"I bought this item for my fiance for his work with his club. As far as the handheld itself, it is just ok, however, I am supposed to be able to connect to my laptop to work on it as well and transfer data to the handheld, but that is what does not work. I have Windows 7, and the two programs dont mesh. After some more research, I ended up buying an infrared so that the 2 will comminucate, but that does not work either. And the keyboard accessory that I also bought to go with it does not work either...Will be returning EVERYTHING and getting a tablet...."
2,Old Model,Product was outdated but customer service was great. They repaired my old unit and sent me a credit for the difference.
1,Items missing!!!,"No cradle was provided with this product; consequently, we could not sinc with the computer! No cradle is available, and the company does not answer phone messages. Such a loss of money!"
3,Palm One m 500 Handheld,"This Palm is OK, but not as great as a more expensive higher end, like M515 product. When using the Palm SD Scrabble card in this level of Palm, the board does not display like the real Scrabble Board. It works, but one must consult the info Legend for which characters represent the tiles for Triple Word, Double Word, Double Letter, etc. It is OK and the best that could happen in a non color setting. But the M515 Color works better because it will display the actual Scrabble Board."
2,Stick with the Vx: m500 Not Compatible,"This is a very nice unit... a Vx with added storage capacity. At least it LOOKS like a Vx, but in fact Palm has changed it just enough so that the accessories and peripherals from the V-series don't fit. Jackets, stylos, cradles, etc. will have to be bought new (some of which are only now coming out). Worse (for me)... I only discovered after buying it that the m500 series uses a (faster) USB cradle which does not work for Windows 95 or NT users. You have to buy an extra (slower) cable/cradle. This planned obsolescence is disappointing."
1,Palm Products not up to par any longer.,"Bought this Palm 13 months ago and this weekend it stopped working. Customer service informed me that they are strictly enforcing their one year ( or 365 days as it's spelled out) warranty. They are more than willing to fix this unit for a whopping One Hundred dollars. Wow.Based on that and better products out there (also available from Amazon) I've begun to research these better options.I would not recommend any of the palm line, unless you are willing to pay twice for it."
2,It worked fine.... for about one and half months,"I purchased refurbshed version of this PDA from one of the marketplace seller, and I thought it was a good deal. Well,,, I have to admit that the PDA itself is awesome (very thin, light weight, palm os, reasonable memory, expansion slot, etc). However, the hotsync function suddenly failed after one and half of use. In my opinion, this pda doesn't worth a thing without the hoysync- writing schedule directly from PDA is one of the most annoying things EVER! ...P.S. those who are having the same problem, this might help.=>"
4,Good product,The Palm m500 is easy to learn and easy to use. The display quality is good and the battery lasts quite a long time between charges. A good black and white option.
2,light and sync problems,"I need a device to maintain appointments that is smaller than my laptop. That was the only reason I bought a used Palm M500 to determine if it met that need. There are three problems, all serious, that prevents the M500 from satisfying the task for which I bought it. The backlight is useless and I cannot sync to my computer. I also bought a rollup keyboard that cannot be used because of, I believe, there is a Windows 7 lack of compatibility. I am now investigating investing in an android phone as a schedule maintenance device. It would seem that the phone can do as much, or more than a PDA and cost less."
1,Renew Electronics M500,"This item was defective upon receipt. Followed the instructions to give a full charge of 4 hour minimum and the screen would not display properly. Upon request I have been sent a postage pre-paid return label and will be returning it for a full refund. Item indicates on back that it was ""Assembled in China"". I still have a working M500 that I bought in 2001 and it was ""Assembled in USA"".Do the math!"
4,"works well, I just liked the original palm better, simpler and just what I needed.","This palm has given me time to learn. More functions I don't need, but it is the only palm available for me just to keep track of appointments and addresses and phone numbers. Could use a back light for when it is darker but other wise works well."
1,PalmOne m500,"The PalmOne m500 I purchased in Sept 2010,has no backup due to it is way to old and out of date. I could not get this unit to work. Look out for older models."
3,Palm M500,We had a Zire 21 and just now up graded to the Palm M500. We bought it from Gamzi Digital and they were very helpful in helping us download the needed software. They even called us back to see if we had any problems.
5,M500-Buy it!,"This is the first PDA I have owned. I didn't think I would have much use for one, and then found out about ebooks. Now that I have it, I find I use the organizer aspect of the M500 more than the ebook. The unit is nice and small, yet the display is easy to read. I read a lot of reviews prior to purchase, and decided I would have to just jump in. I'm glad I got the Palm versus others I read about. It seems like a superior product, and the company is topnotch. I use it both at work and home, and I have yet to tap into all the great things it will do. For those of you who wonder if you really NEED one, well, you don't. But they are sure nice to have. Now I just need to find the perfect case....."
4,Palm m500,"The Palm m500 is great. The reason I got it was for reading ebooks on the go. I've looked online for the cheapest ebook reader and this is it. It is pretty old, but very reliable. It doesn't have many applications, but you can download a few online. I would recommend this product to anyone. If you intend on buying this though, I would also recommend you buy a hard case for it too. I dropped my Palm m500 not too long ago for the first time and, when I picked it up, it had several vertical lines spaced out on the screen. I definitely intend on getting another one though. This time with a hard case."
4,Solid Workhorse,"Basic PDA that has done what I needed it to do for many, many years (thought for sure I got it pre-2000s but Wikipedia suggests post-2001). If your needs are more utilitarian and you don't feel the need to buy the ""Latest Greatest"" every year or so, this puppy will do for you. I've got a handful of apps on it but would still consider it useful even without them. Get the ""Kensington PDA Protector Hard Case Blue Ice Designed for Palm Vm505 M500"" for it!"
4,Does everything I need it to do,"I bought this to help me do inventory at work, as well as to help keep track of my food orders from different providers, and so far I am very pleased with the machine. It does everything I need it to do and more. I was able to download a spreadsheet program that makes doing my inventory very easy."
4,Hard to find but worth the wait,I bought this to use with a program for truck parts. It works great with it.
1,Horrible hot sync; dead battery in 1 year.,"I think most of those who have given this palm a one star or who wish to give it a negative star have summed it up correctly. The palm does not consistently sync. After 1 year of use, mine was dead as a doornail unless it was attached to the charger. Hence, I've not used it in a while.Does that mean it's time to spend $40 on a battery? Is it really worth it? Not! Mine's in mint condition, and I'll take what I can get for it on Ebay. Time for a reliable PDA."
4,Good Stuff Menard,"This hand held thermal unit is great and if you want to look like a Star Trek crew member, I suggest you buy it. You can store all your giganton information unit, all you need is a DSV modem which is an infra-red pattern. This also comes with a calculator, daily time sheet, 200 language selections, time, weather in 64 countries, web access, clip-board, cell phone gigatizer, daily planning book, and other receptive data bases that have little or no use."
1,Palm m500 - Be Aware,"I purchased a Palm m500 from another retailer, and was unable to sync the unit to my pc. After several calls and 15 days, I was finally told by palm support that my unit was defective. They advised me to return it to the store for a replacement, or to send the unit and cradle to Palm for a replacement. The store no longer carried that product, and upon further investigation and direct questioning, tech support at Palm then revealed to me that I would only receive a refurbished unit from them. It would appear that there is a known problem with the Palm m500, as Palm support has advised me they no longer make this unit, and all the stores that I have contacted will no longer be carrying this particular unit."
1,Would you trust your most important data to this?,"I owned a terrific Palm V which I dropped and destroyed by accident. Then I bought an m500. What a mistake. It has been nothing but problems.I had the same problems as everybody else with the USB cradle not Hotsynching. I tried resetting the handheld several times and eventually it came back on. But what a royal pain. Also, the battery has been a problem too. For two weeks I couldn't get a charge to hold. Again, hard resetting it over an over helped.This device cost far too much to behave this way. Tech support was limited and not helpful. I won't buy another Palm device."
2,Mixed bag; one bad one and one good one,"My wife has a palm m500 that she likes, I have a palm m500 that works so inconsistently I am looking for something else. My wife's will not sync with the computer, so I had the computer looked at and tuned up by the computer doctor. That did not help. We received a court document saying we could change out the sync modules, but we had to have the receipt proving we bought the palm. OF course, they had our warranty certification and address, but that was not good enough. Overall, My wife is decently happy with hers, but with all the problems we have had, I would never buy another Palm. Oh, the 90 day warranty is not too great either. I assume that the the Palm people have little trust in their product or they would offer a year warranty. I'm sure the 25 dollars they charge for service after the 90 day warranty is a major profit center for them. After thinking about this some more, I not only won't buy from them, I hope they go out of business."
2,Good but unsupported device,"I have been unable to install software to synchronize my m500 with my Intel-architecture PC that runs Windows Vista. Without synchronization, the device is not very useful."
1,Review of Palm,This product is useless because there are no drivers for Windows 7. Why would anyone sell a produt that cqannot be used with the current versions of Windows. I wish I had never purchased it or I wish I could find a driver that will work with 64 bit technology.
2,Sub standaard,Terrible time syncing with Outlook folders. No longer supported by Palm Tech support. What's a fella to do. I have already purchased a Z22 to replace this one. I wish it weighed more so I sould use it as a boat anchor.
1,No Mail-in rebate recieved,Very disappointed to find no mail-in rebate enclosed for the free Palm M105 that was advertised to go with the M500
1,frustrated,"I just received the Palm m500 a few days ago. I bought it as a gift for my mother. I've downloaded the proper info, charged it, and now I've spent over 30 min. trying to set the date and time. It shouldn't be this hard, but it wont read the stylus (which came with the set.) The unit just keeps beeping and beeping as if I've done something wrong. Since I can't get it to work, how on earth is my mother? This item will be returned as I cannot get it to work. What a waste of time and money."
1,Links to 7?,"The palm 500 may be good, I was replaceing my Z22 I really liked, but didn't want a new one. I have transitioned mostly to Blackberry, but wished to maintain my Palm data.At this point, I have not been able to get it to work in Windows 7. 62 bucks down the tube."
4,M500,"The M500 does what the specs say it will do except the Palm update to fix the back-lighting problem does not seem to work. The Renew Electronics tech support lady, Lynne, gets 5+ stars for her help."
3,Palm,"Not too satisfied with the palm. Looks nice, however I was looking for something to replace my appointment calendar. I wanted to be able to set appointment dates, then hear an alarm when the appointment was near. Disappointed. Not what I expected at all."
1,Serious design flaw and Palm knows it.,"I have had to replace my M500 4 times since I purchased it less than 6 months ago. The electrostatic discharge problem, acknowledged on the Palm website as a design flaw, has not been remedied by the ""enhanced"" cradle. Most importantly Palm has not done the right thing, refund the cost or replace the PDA with a working alternative model. Terrible policy, terrible product. Caveat emptor and check out the Sony's."
3,Useful but got old fast,While I can't say that I love this product I WILL say that it pretty much gets the job done.
3,I love the concept of the PDA but........,"I have purchased 2 Palm PDA's (Palm 500 & Palm T/X) and they both have not been able to hold up.That is, after a couple of years of moderate use, the sensors in the screen at the perimeter give out and I can nolonger use the device. I will not give up. It is 2011, some company should have a PDA that willhold up to moderate to extreme usage. For me it is like reading a book, you can take it anywhere and absorb youself ina game and more. I will search and find the technology that is for me."
1,disappointed,I like the Palm Pilot but I am locked out & need a contact number or instruction manual to enter my password again.I returned the Palm Pilot to Mr.Sporn Israel with the promise that he would replace it with a new one if I mailed the one I couldn't get to work.Now I am having a problem getting him to live up to that promise. I ordered a different from another company & would like a refund for the Palm 500 that I sent back to him.
2,PalmOne,"The display is very dark even with the backlight on. Otherwise, I am sure it is fine. I sent it back."
3,Can't get alarm or email to work,"PalmOne m500 HandheldNo matter what I've tried, I can't for the life of me get the alarm to work. Also I cannot get my email to work either."
1,Palm m500--bad product!,This palm m500 has never even turned on. I tried to talk to a palm service rep but he barely spoke english and kept wanting me to upgrade to a more expensive model. I even bought a new battery for it. What an incredible waste of my money. I don't ever plan on purchasing any other palm devices.
1,Call Palm B4 you buy,Dont buy!!!!!! They stopped making this unit in 2006. Call Palm and ask for your self.Phone: 866-935-72567Cant even get a battery if you need a spare.
4,No complaints,"So far the Pilot is great. Still learning it at this point, but the interface is intuitive. It does exactly what was claimed and is perfect for my needs."
1,A complete Waste,This purchase was a total waste of money and time. And the 10-day turn around period for returning did not allow enough time to complete the many attempts with the Best Buy Geek squad as well as my own efforts to load the program onto my computer. We all really tried and it took a lot of time fitting in with a very busy work schedule.I am done with your services unless an extended return time can be offered/provided.Barbara McClamma
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, SHE LOVED IT BUT HAD TOSEND IT BACK BECAUSE IT WORKED TWO DAYS. I LIKE THE FEATURES BUTNOT SURE HOW LONG THE REPLACEMENT WILL LAST. THE SCREEN STOPPEDWORKING WITH THE STYLUS. BOUGHT THUMBOARD, WORKED ONE DAY AND QUIT."
2,"Good while it lasted, but it is time to let go","Carried me for almost ten years, with just a few crashes and technical problems and at reasonable expense. I bought a third at the end of the life of my second one and quickly realized that the technological world had passed the Palm Pilot by. It had always been a hassle to synchronize the device in its cradle, although it made me feel wonderfully productive when the process of ""synching"" noted all the additions, deletions and edits to my time and tasks.If all you want is an electronic calendar, with a good task tracker, this will suffice. But support and replacements will be progressively harder to come by and expect dismissive glances from Crackberry users."
1,won't work on 64 bit vista,"The supplier of this products tells me that this is an old ad above. That it no longer comes with a hotsync cradle and you can't use it with 64 bit Vista. That none of the Palm products will work with 64 Vista if you have to use the connection cord so I had to send mine back although the supplier said he would credit my account thro Amazon, I am still out the postal fees both ways."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I purchased this item as a Christmas present back in September 2010. I purchased it as a new item, but as others have also stated, when the recipient tried to use it, it did not come with any of the software that a new Palm would come with. Its software was dated 2001 and was not compatible with Windows Vista (though it did work with XP). The docking station was broken right out of the box. It did not come with an operating manual.For those of you who got screwed over like me, I offer the following resources to see if you can rehabilitate your product.Here are the items the Palm should come with: [...]Here is the handbook: [...]Here is the location for software support: [...]Since I am outside Amazon's 90-day guarantee, it looks like I'm going to have to eat the cost on this one. If anyone else orders one, make sure you have EVERYTHING in those pictures."
1,My review,"The device I ordered did not work. Rather than ordering a replacement, I went on line to look at reviews of similar Palm models. A number contained the same symptoms mine had, so I returned it to the seller. It was a discontinued model, so no surprise there.I was impressed with the attitude of the seller, who simply asked me to return the item and my refund was credited within 24 hours."
1,No support available,"If you are running Windows 7, DO NOT PURCHASE this product. No support available as it is a product no longer supported by Palm. I have tried every resource I could find to resolve my Hot Sync issues with no luck. Really made a mistake by purchasing this item."
5,HELLO WAKE UP!!! THIS IS NOT A SMART PHONE PEOPLE!,"To all the people in the last... lets see... 6 years, reviewing this product and bombing it with one star.This is outdated technology. What do you expect. Wake up"
2,"Great design, poor quality","The M500 is compact, attractively designed PDA with all the great Palm features. However, when it comes to reliability it is less than satisfactory. I bought my M500 in August 2001 and have had 3 replacement units since then and now the 4th replacment unit is failing. Palm Support (after you get by the $.../call threat) has been good, but who needs the inconvenience of the lost time while obtaining and setting up a replacement unit and the frustration of not being able to count on you PDA when you need it? Problems have included locking up, screen turning cloudy, touch screen frequently losing allignment, and battery completely and mysteriously discharging right after recharge. It is also a challenge to initially set up Hotsynch with Windows XP.If the M500 was dependable, it would deserve 5 stars but based on the number of units I've gone through, 2 stars is probably too generous."
3,worth the price,"This is not a fantastic DVD - the director perhaps likes POWER POINT PRESENTATIONS too much for my taste. The pianist is very good, but, and I really hope I am wrong, he seemed to be exhausted - and wasn't at his best playing Chopin. My personal oppinion is that everything is worth - every work is the best one could perform at that time - every note comes from the heart. But (another but....sorry....) this is not a super performance. You can have it to study the music. And that's always worth."
5,brilliant collection of real folk tales,"A fantastic collection with beautiful and horrific illustrations of little-known Grimm's fairy tales in their original, earliest, uncensored versions (for instance, revealing Rapunzel's pregnancy, Princess Furball's sexually abusive father, the true gore and violence of The Juniper Tree and Cinderella). A great collection for both adults and older children as the violence, darkness, and danger add not only a greater level of entertainment and imagination, but also of psychological importance in its deeper look into the depths of human psychology and experience. Grade: A"
3,Incomplete.,"I've got the original 1998 paperback black cover release & apparently no additional stories were added to this reprint.It was great for it's time, but there are enough dark stories missing to have merited a sequel, & since there is no volume 2, I suggest you get ""The Complete Brothers Grimm Fairy Tales"" instead.Sarah Williams' comment about Allerleirauh is also accurate."
3,Albanian standard dictionary,"It's good for basics, worth the $$ if that's all your looking for.But, Not as comprehensive as I would have liked:("
1,1 Star here for Price - Remastered CD Again in Print!,"This might be the best POCO release ever. For many years it was almost impossible to find in a new CD format. This drove prices to near ridiculous levels. As the market will bear, I suspect. Now, finally, you can find this as part of a combo release remastered CD set - Under the Gun & Blue and Gray released by BGO records for under $20. Available now on Amazon as an imported CD. For those folks gouging in order to make a buck, your prices have just gone down."
2,watery...,"After reading all the good reviews, I thought this was going to be awesome cheese sauce, it isn't. It has no thickness to it at all when heated up. I mean it's about as thick as water. Absolutely terrible for nachos."
5,Great taste--a little thin for me for,"I gave this 5 stars as a great nacho cheese sauce base because it tastes great. (It's a little thin for me since I don't squirt it from a pump.) At $19.98 for a dozen 15 oz cans, you couldn't make a more tasty base so cheaply. I add some corn starch and heat it in the microwave (stirring every 15 seconds) to thicken it up. I also add a few slices of processed cheeze to richen it up. That's just my preference."
5,An honest account of the Penitente religion,"This book is based on a thorough study of the Penitente religion. After reading the significant analysis given, many myths and absurdities of the Penitente religion and practices were clarified for me. The Penitentes, a religious group, that have been falsely persecuted for decades have finally been accurately represented. The contribution of this research is extremely significant for all of society especially anyone interested in knowing more about religious studies or New Mexico's history."
2,Misleading,"The title of this book leads one to assume that this work was published as a follow up to Fit For Life, a great book. The problem is this book was written prior to Fit For Life. There is nothing new in this cookbook. I am beginning to believe that Fit For Life was a ""one hit wonder."""
5,I lost 30 pounds effortlessly and I'm healthier than ever.,"This book helped me to drop 30 pounds in less than 6 weeks. I feel alive again. I've never felt this good. Not only did I take the weight off, but I also lost my asthma and chronic fatigue. Thank you Marilyn Diamond."
3,It's o.k.,"This book is just o.k. I read the ""Fit For Life"" book and loved it. I thought this book would be equally good, but it isn't really all that."
2,Everything falls out!,"My three year old son wanted a case for all of his cars, and although this case holds a lot it is very difficult to use. He has a hard time opening and closing the case and the plastic road pad came off almost immediately. The cars also fall out when you wheel the case around and then open it again. I think he finds it very frustrating, but he does seem to enjoy putting the cars in and out. I'm looking for a better case."
2,Hot Wheels Take Along,"I bought this for my son couple years ago. It does hold alot of cars and is a good idea but the flap broke instantly and when you try to wheel it around, the cars all fall out!"
1,Poor product,"I bought this toy at Toys""R""Us for the same price as it's being sold here. After we got all the cars in we had a hard time closing the case because the cars fall out. The slots in the case are too small overall to fit most of our Hot Wheels cars and it won't hold the semi's at all. My son does enjoy this product but I personally think it could have been better constructed. Matel could have done some testing before releasing such a shoddy product. I feel the clear car cases are a lot more sturdy and the sizes of the slots are better. I'm not sure; however, if they are made by Matel."
2,not durable at all,This concept is a good idea but this product is not made well enough to hold up for active children. My 3 1/2 yr. old can't fit alot of his cars into it because the spaces are too small. The case itself doesn't stay closed and the plastic road looking piece doesn't stay attached. The wheels are bar that pulls out are durable but what good do they do you when the whole thing won't stay closed. The only thing my son thinks is fun about it is putting them in and taking them out (the ones that fit). The educational value is organization and responsibility to pick up after themselves.
5,Ripples of Greatness,"Wouldn't you love to hear Bach play his Toccatta and Fugue in Dm? Well, we can't. But we can hear the late, great Sergey Rachmaninov struttin' his stuff, playing his famous Prelude in C#m, Op. 3 No. 2. Yeah, it's taken from an old tape, but it's clear enough to be amazing. I, for one, was a little suprised to hear dynamics in his interpretation that one doesn't often hear in the performance of that piece. An historic recording certainly worth having in your audio library."
3,"Showing its Age, 1951","I hadn't realized the first edition was in 1951 before I bought it. Drawings are too small. Text is definitely from another era. All B&W illio. More accessible than Goldfinger's Anatomy. But if this is all you can afford, used, then buy it."
5,Best overall anatomy book I own,"Not too dense, easy to carry in your bag. Just a wealth of good stuff I am always using to practice and expand my anatomy knowledge. It's really good about breaking down the construction of anatomy (similar to Constructive Anatomy which is also great) and uses great examples to help you understand anatomical structure. It also has plenty of detailed visuals when you want to get a very in depth understanding of bone/muscle groups. Of the half a dozen anatomy books I own, this one would be the best to sum up the subject."
5,Great anatomy book!,"Atlas of Human Anatomy For the Artist is an excellent book. I found it in a college library and after borrowing it for two weeks, I knew I had to buy my own copy. It is very thorough on the subject of human anatomy and goes into specifics regarding the differences in gender,age, and body mass. I read alot of anatomy books and have not come across too many willing to go beyond the ideal body type. I found it especially helpful that this book provides detailed drawings and photographs of the figure; some books only have rough sketches which are not very helpful. This book is not just for those who want to draw the figure; those who model the figure in 3D applications will also find it useful. Atlas of Human Anatomy For the Artist is not the only anatomy book an artist or animator will need, but it is an excellent addition to their personal library."
5,Great quick referance for drawing .,"Mostly focusing on bone, and muscle structure this guide is excellent for finding what you need quickly. Easy to use but detailed I can usually find what I'm looking for in a couple seconds."
3,Pretty Good for the Price,This book is a cheap and good reference for beginning figure drawers. The diagrams are fairly clear but some of the hand-drawn references get confusing.
5,Simplicity of form,Peck manages to breakdown scientific understanding of the human form into simple graphic shapes. Up there with Andrew Loomis's work.
3,"Good, But not Great","This is an okay anatomical reference book, it does a good job covering skeletal construction and isolated body parts but I found it lacking in the areas of musculature and the human form as a whole. While not without merit, there are better references out there."
2,There are much better books available,"As an artist looking to enhance my skill set I was looking for a book that would bridge the gap. This book however, fell pretty flat. For one the majority (over 60%) of the diagrams are very lack luster and rudimentary pencil sketches that will not help anyone with even a remote drawing ability. It doesn't help anyone who wishes to see how the muscle groups and joint actually move either. I would suggest you pay a little more money and get the professional anatomy books that are available."
5,excellent book,"An excellent textbook for engineers, and a necessary reference for Matlab toolbox (System Identification)."
2,Poorly written book for the engineer. Might be useful for a mathemtician,"Let me be the first to slam this book as having little practical use. The author uses a very unconventional, inconsistent notation that renders this book virtually unreadable. This is coming from somebody who has taken various courses in probability/stochastic processes, system dynamics, controls, and Kalman filtering.The ""theory"" part in the title is dead on, but what about the ""for the user"" part? What user is this referring to, an ivory tower professor? Most of the problems at the end of each chapter begin with ""prove"", which in my opinion makes this a math book and not an engineering text. A practical example never surfaces in the text."
4,A Complete Text for System Identification,"This book is very through in presenting methods of system identification...mathematically. However as with most good mathematical oriented books there are not a lot of practical design type problems. One other mark aginst the book is that similar notation is used for different topics, which can sometimes be a bit confusing. One thing I might recommend, to a potential buyer is that you take a course in random process, and possess a through understanding of signals and transforms. All in all though if a little more meat in terms of practicality were added I'd rate this book a five."
3,Notational Inconsistency killed this book,"I have two system identification books on my table right now: One is by Prof Ljung and the other is 'Time Series: Theory and Methods' by Profs. Brockwell and Davis, and I must say that I refer to the latter much more often than the former. The primary reason for this is that Prof. Ljung's book uses notation very inconsistently. This makes for very difficult reading. On the other hand 'Time Series: T&M;' is consistent and an excellent resource. Both books are of an advanced nature, suitable for graduate students. Again, 'Time Series T&M;' is more rigorous.Nonetheless, if you plan on using Matlab's Sys Id toolbox, I would recommend Prof. Ljung's book. He wrote the toolbox, and he refers heavily in the Matlab documentation to the book."
1,Expensive,there is a very cheap of the very same version of this master piece which for some reason amazon does not bring on! maybe because its cheaper. check this ISBN and save your bucks: 0138816409
5,i really like it. All the songs are awsome!,Musical Youth is a very old album but the music is awsome. I have been wanting to buy this cd for a very long time and i have gonne to every music store and no one had it. A month ago i ordered it from amazon.com and i have been listening to it over and over. I like the songs very much
4,Simple Wooden Lamp,"This gift for my grandson is a simple old fashioned wooden single bulb lamp. The colors are bold and the quality is good. Mine came with the shade damaged, but the seller could not provide a replacement only a refund. Too bad!Amazon did send an email stating they would provide a refund on the item."
3,love the product - but don't buy for this price!,I could not find these in stores for the longest time. As soon as I broke down and paid this price they started appearing everywhere - for no shipping and cheaper to begin with! I still love the candy but would never pay this price again.
3,good product but expensive,very expensive for the amount you get - found it at rite aid for half the price of amazon
3,Smell?,"I love how gentle this soaps is and I was looking forward to making baby soap and hand soap and shampoo etc. When I used it I noticed that it had a weird smell when I mixed it with anything. My husband told me the dish soap I made smelled like mold. I only added lemon juice and lemon essential oil but it did not mix well with the ""unscented"" castile soap. I don't know if this is just my husband and I who have this problem, but I do not care for the smell of this soap."
5,A boy and his dog.,I love this book! An amazing story of the bond between a boy and his dog! I would highly recommend this book to any animal lovers or anyone looks for a great adventure.
5,Old Yeller Review,I liked Old Yeller because it is about a young boy whosedad goes away leaves him in charge. He has his work cut out for him and then this dog comes along. At first they dont get along but then the dog saves his brothers life.The worst part of the book is when the wild boars catch the dog and slashed his side open. The slash in his side revealed his enternal organs. This leaves him two choices either patch him up or kill him.The setting is the most illustrated part of this book. It makes you feel as if you are out west killng and growing what you eat.The description of the wild life is so realistic it seems to walk out of the book.
5,A Classic,"This is a story I never grow tired of reading. It's about a boy named Travis who has to look after his mom and little brother while his father is away. It's about the big yellow dog that Travis resents at first, then grows to love, then loses in tragedy. It is a compelling story that I enjoyed very much."
5,It Warms the Heart,"I read this when i was younger and loved it! It's a great book about a dog, Old Yeller, and a pioneer family.Old Yeller is a stray with one ear almost no tail at all.He really takes to Travis, and boy, oh boy do they have adventures!It's really a must-read for all ages!"
3,Sad but good,"Old yeller was sad but it was a wonderful story. Very well written, and a great story. I loved it."
5,CGE Student Review,"I give Old Yeller five stars. The author of this book is Fred Gipson. Fred Gipson didn't write any other books but if he did Old Yeller would be my favorite book. This book is non fiction. The book theme is never get too attached with your dog you never know what's going to happen.The author's writing style is sad but still interesting it also makes you want to turn the page as soon as possible. The main characters are little Arlis, Travis, mama, and my favorite character is Travis.In the book the main characters live in Texas and they live in a little cabin type house like back in the olden days. The most exciting part to me was when Travis was about to be killed by hogs then old yeller came in and saved him. But can Travis save Old Yeller?I recommend this book to people who like to read sad but still scary at the same time. This book will put you on the edge of your seat. I like this book because it is interesting but sad at the same time."
4,Old Yeller,"The novel Old Yeller is the best story I've ever read in my life. I have read a lot of books and this one I really like .My favorite scene is when Old Yeller attacks the bear because she was going to attack little Allis for not letting her baby free. I picked this part because you could tell Old yeller really likes the Travis family. I wouldn't change anything in this book .I like the way he's written in his own words. I couldn't have written it better than him, because he has more experience then me. I recommend it to my friends because it's a really good book and it interesting but some parts are sad and funny. I really got into it."
4,I found this book very exciting.,I liked this book because it had action. It was never boring at any point. It teaches you that things that you don't like at the beginning you may like later.
5,Just as good the second time around.,"I first read this book when I was in the fifth grade, and it touched my heart then. I just re-read it before giving it to my 10-year old daughter to read. It touched my heart again as I got reacquainted with the boy and his big yeller dog."
5,The best book ever,This book was really good I sure liked it. it really is interesting and inspiring. I loved it so much that I'm going to write a book like it without it being it.
4,I really enjoyed the book Old Yeller.,I really enjoyed the book Old Yeller. Some of the words I couldn't understand but I still liked the book. I thought it was an interesting book about a boy and his dog. The book starts off when Travis finds a stray dog stealing his food.Travis dislikes this dog but then he gains great friendship with his dog Old Yeller. Travis and Old Yeller have many adventures out in the woods together. I would recommend this book to anyone who is adventurous like me.
5,Where the Red Fern Grows,"This book, oh my gosh, is the most saddest, most inspiring, wonderful, thrilling, heartbreaking, incredible, better than Old Yeller, action packed book I have read, it will and always be my favorite book ever in my entire life. (ok, now onto about the story) This is a book about a young boy who has these two gorgeous redbone coon hounds, Old Dan and Little Ann. They go on many exiting adventures and one day end up winning the coon hunring championship. After that, there is a heartbreaking scene. So my advice is, if you don't want your heart to be filled with sadness, exitement and love, then it's time to look for a different book. - Caitlyn"
5,A Good Book,"The book I read was Old Yeller. It was sad in some parts and happy in others, it also had laughter in it. The saddest part in the book was at the end. This is one of the best books I've read. I would recomend it to anyone who likes dogs. I gave this book a rating of 5 stars because in my eyes it was a good book."
1,scott's reveiw,"when old yeller first came to the farm travis wanted to kill him but when he had to it was like shooting at a famiy member. From the moment old yeller showed up travis didn't like him for 2 reasons. 1 he didn't want a dog and 2 because he had stolen all their winter meat. As, time when travis hated that dog more and mor and more untill old yeller saved little arliss from an angry bear from then on travis and old yeller were inseperatable untill the day old yellers former owner come in looking for his dog bt they make a deal and the family ges to keep old yeller. but, wonce travis and old yeller go out to lable hogs travis urts his leg and old yeller almost dies and just as their getting better 2 mad cows show up and old yeller gets hydroprbia. i think that this is a great book."
3,Old Yeller is an Okay Book,"Old Yeller is a great book for younder kids. However, for an eighth grader, the book sucks. The best part is the bull fighting part. The worst part is when the dog dies."
4,A thrilling book that will keep you at the edge of your seat,This is a touching story of a yourng boy about to become a man. He's fater has to leave him to get some money. The part where there was the bear really was thrilling.The bull fight was a real scry part that kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. What really kept me reading was the thought that it could happen to anyone. I think this is a good book to read. THis book was real sad and it made me cry. I hope you would llike to read this too.
3,Classic Tail,"Timeless classic of a boy and his dog coming of age together. The unfortunate truth about getting a dog is that you are obtaining a best friend, a near family member whom you will inevitably outlive, perhaps that is their purpose. This is the story of this happening on the Texas frontier."
3,Famous old dogs,"One of the most unique traits of American culture is the emphasis given to the bonds between dogs and humans, specifically boys or young men. Examples of this include Lassie, Benji, Where the Red Fern Grows, Call of the Wild, and this classic from the mid 20th century: Old Yeller. Set in farm country, the story revolves around a 14 year old boy who is left alone with his mom and younger brother for a year while the father is of getting money driving cattle. Our protagonist encounters a big yellow dog that is adopted by the family. Old Yeller, as the dog is called, soon proves his worth and becomes an integral part of the family. Tragically, the book ends with our protagonist having to kill Old Yeller after the dog gets into a deadly fight with a rabid wolf. But like other children stories, this one has a happy ending as the family adopts Old Yeller's progeny. Overall, the book takes under 2 hours to read, and is quite enjoyable."
5,the classic tearjerker,"Old Yeller is a must read for all ages. I never read it until age 46 and I could not put it down. It shows the love of a complete family for the animals ranging from a beloved cow, Spot, to the big ""yeller dog"" Also is shows the love of the family!!! I enjoyed the animal encounters-the vivid depictions of wolves and wild pigs. This is a definiate read for someone who wants to see frontier life and people who lived it. Boys as well as girls will appreciate this tale!!!"
2,Yorktown,The movie would have been better if you could see what was going on. the whole movie is so dark. I have been to yorktown and was wanting to see places I got to walk around in.
1,You must be joking,"if you gave this film more than a 2. It screams amateur. The acting is bad, its recorded like a soap opera, there is no tension, the dialogue is silly, and the reveal toward the end is idiotic. The killer (the one that spoke) was just not believable. He should've followed the lead of the other guy and kept his mouth shut. The reason given as to why the killings are happening doesn't carry the weight of the film by any means. Why the second guy turns on the first one is never addressed. Its just poorly done and the generous reviews must be from people connected with the project. I can't imagine any self respecting horrorphile being satisfied with this. Sorry to burst any bubbles."
2,don't you laugh at cc HA,"don't you dare laugh at cc HA. she's the baddest, most beautifullest homicide detective since angelina jolie disgraced the police force by getting knocked up by the serial killer she was investigating in ""taking lives"". spooks of the forest, serial killers or jealous girlfriends don't stand a chance against detective cc HA. and when the case is finally solved, you better believe HA is gonna have the last laugh!"
5,A quest where a young boy will let his courage shine!!!!!,"Rowan is not the typical son of Rin.He is not strong, intelligent or courageous.He is a poor swimmer, small and boney.His mother, Jillian has no faith in him, and loves her younger daughter more, because of her strenghth and happiness that brightens those days which Rowan blackens.Rowan is unloved, unwanted, a nothing among the strong and witty children of Rin.His mother is beautiful and strong, and each day thinks of how unwanted he will grow up to be.But one day, the witch Sheba sends seven chosen ones from the village of Rin, to the looming mountains, to defeat the evil dragon, and Rowan, is one of them.Read this charming story about finding the courage, that you never knew existed."
5,an excellent piece of fiction,"when i read this, i couldn't put it down. Emily rodda carefully twists the storyline and lets your think a bit about what will happen next. Story of a young ""skinny rabbit"" boy, who has to save his village. the boy takes on the challenge and shows all the villagers that even he should not be overlooked. sequels: rowan and the travellers rowan and the keeper of the crystal both excellent reads as welli loved the cryptic rhymes in the books that were unfolded as the stories progressed"
2,My review,"I was deeply disappointed in this book. After hearing so many raving reviews, I decided to borrow it from the library. About two pages into it, I knew I didn't like it.The plot was predictable. Rowan sets out to do something, the others fail, only Rowan can do it...I myself did not enjoy this book. Only good thing was that one of the characters had my name. :DBut then again, I am a slightly older reader. Perhaps it would have been more enjoyable had I been younger. One can never tell...Hope this helped.~Togo Fan"
2,*Yawn*,"A dragon that lives on top of a mountain. A witch/wise woman who makes herbal remedies and resides in a hut at the edge of the village. Big, scary spiders in a forest. A swamp filled with phantoms. A shepherd boy turned hero.Where have I read all this before?There's nothing wrong with using familiar concepts to tell a story. After all, Tolkien borrowed heavily from old and middle English writing, and Hogwarts is situated next to a forest full of spiders. However, when a story consists of nothing except rehashed elements, and the characters are only marginally engaging, it has problems. Add to that the fact that you can correctly predict most of the plot after reading the first few chapters, and you have something less than a worthwhile book. The fact that it's geared toward a young age group does not excuse a lack of creativity."
1,Rowan of Rin,I have read the Deltora Quest series and Rowan of Rin doesn't stand a chance against it. I thought this was very slow and boring. I would not buy this book. Read Deltora Quest-it's much better.
2,Where's The Mix?,"This was a very disappointing album. Disc One is a so called ""mix"" of funk/rare songs, but the blends are simplistic at best. Some songs seem more like a fade out than a blend meaning ""beat to beat"". In addition, these songs had very little commonality between them at all. Not that that is a necessity but a mixing Striplin's ""Can't Turn Me Away"" into Ripperton's ""Lovin You"" just doesn't make any sense. Maybe I totally missed the concept he was trying to convey. Maybe I should read the liner notes, but I don't think that will change my perspective. I bought this for the mixed version with the hopes that there was some creativity or thematic approach taken. Because I and most music (funk/R&B) aficionados already have most of these songs anyway, Disc Two is useless to me. I'll only keep this because I don't have the Striplin cut. But once that album becomes available, Blueprint becomes a frisbee headed to my friend in Alabama. Keep funkin!"
4,FUNK CLASSICS,"If you love REAL SOUL & FUNK music this CD is definitely for you. I fell i love with this CD at a party and had to buy it for my collection. It doesn't really mix the old school jams together but, is a complete collection of all your favorites."
1,"JUNK, utter junk","This hard case is cheap, cheesy plastic with velco to fasten your PDA to the interior. It is inconceivable that this is a PalmOne product but the sad fact is that it is indeed. Avoid, avoid, avoid. I returned mine to the store from whence it came and the return was accepted despite the opened bubble pack."
1,Not for the Zire 31,"I also have problems with the paint coming off the case. Also, the case is really intended for the Zire 21, where the power cable and the USB connection are off the top edge of the PDA: The case hinges at the top, flipping open like a Star Trek communicator, so access to these ports is easy.This is NOT for the Zire 31: Palm added a Secure Digital card slot and a headphone socket to the 31, and there apparently was not enough room for the power and USB connector as well, not to mention the infared sensor, on the top edge. On the 31, power and USB are imbedded along the left edge, and there's a white rubber cover attached to the case to cover those holes when they're not in use. The PDA is attached to the case by applying adhesive velcro strips to the case and PDA, and the sides of the case are too high when the case is open to permit plugging these into the PDA without physically pulling the PDA partially off the velcro.Still looking for some protection for a really good PDA."
2,Poorly Designed Case,"This case is poorly designed. The Zire 72 supports MP3 but the only way to use that with this case is either to open the case or to drill a hole in the top to insert the headphone jack.There are no holes for charging or synching. You have to remove the unit from the case.The case has adhesive velcro to attach the device to the case. You have to cut it in two before you install it so the serial number is visible.All in all, this appears to be a cheap third party case that is sold under the brand name."
4,brittish blues of john mayall school,"This is one of my old favorites! The lyrics are not the best part of it (looks like mr. Dunbar or whoever wrote the lyrics was pissed with his girlfriend), but the music effort is very good. Borrowed introduction from JS Bach's Fantasia is totally unexpected, but fits right into the blues. Victor Brox's voice (he later sang Caiafas on JC Superstar 2LP with Ian Gillan) is one of the few low voices found in pop music, and though he is not doing much singing here, at least, this is Brittish blues with somebody who has voice (heh, heh). Somewhat monotonous toward the end, but overall very interesting."
3,Short?,"It may be my fault that I thought this was an interpretation, or an overview or something like that. It is the letter in the raw- somewhat disappointing...."
2,This book was written over 100 yerars ago,"This book was written over 100 yerars ago, therefore I feel defrauded by amazon. It is so time worn that in places it is actually funny. It covers material outdated so it is more like a history lesson on thoughts of the unconscious mind."
1,Night Light Ruptured,"I had 4 of these nightlights in my house, all the same model. My model was 71352 but is exactly the same as shown here on Amazon. Two came with UL stickers and two did not. They are 120V / 60Hz and 0.3W. This morning before I left for work I smelled something ""HOT"" in the house, like something was melted. We looked all over and didn't notice anything unusual. We went to work, and when I came home I noticed one of the nightlights was not working. From a distance, the lens where the light would normally shine through looked black. Upon closer inspection I discovered the nightlight had ruptured, had black stuff on it and smelled burned or hot. I unplugged it and the electrical outlet was also a little blackened. This nightlight did not have the UL sticker on it. I'm very upset because this could have started a fire and burned my house down! I unplugged the rest and will never use them again."
1,Dangerous and Scary - Caution Do not buy!,"Exact same result as the other review written. Placed this night lite in our bathroom. Came home from work and the AmertTac 71352 had literally exploded. I discovered the lense on the floor. It had blown off the night lite unit which remained plugged into the outlet, and there was black residue covering my bathroom vanity top. The unit was black and clearly burned while the smell of the melted nightlite remained in the bathroom.We are very disturbed that this occurred. This night lite by AmerTac is clearly a fire hazard. It is apparent that this is a trend with this item and not just a bad unit. The thought of this lite starting a fire in my baby's bedroom still haunts me."
1,two of four dead in first year,"I purchased four AmerTac 71352 night lights that appear to be identical with current model. One quit real soon. After about a year, another produce so little light it was tough to see even at night. Some have reported these devices smoke / burn; Maury at AmerTac says 71352 is not on recall list for fires or like."
4,Bringing Words to Life,Bringing Words to Life was a great resource in teaching vocabulary development to school age children. The most important item that was helpful to me was identifying the vocabulary tiers. It was very helpful in developing vocabulary lessons.
3,If I had world enough and time...,"I think the ideas here are sound, but as I read I imagine a team of writers working together and spending many hours devising lessons. Working teachers don't have that much time. It is generally a bad sign when the positive reviews on the back cover of the book are from PhDs. Quite often these people have never actually used the book with students."
4,Vocabulary Venture,Bringing Words to Life: Robust Vocabulary Instruction was a wonderful book that provided several helpful and useful ideas. It expanded on ideas I have already been using with my children and outlined reasons why some of my ideas may not have been successful in the past. The only complaint that I had was that some of the chapters tended to be a little lengthy and made reading somewhat difficult at times. But overall I enjoyed the book and the discussions it provoked in our book study group.I would recommend it to teachers and others involved in the vocabulary development of children.
4,Bringing Words to Life,This book does a great job of explaining the whys and hows of teaching vocabulary to children. It is a great read for teachers of any grade level or subject area. It is not a very exciting read for those outside of educational professions.
3,Good Resource,"I thought this book was informative and loaded with ideas. I teach First Grade and I would reccommend it to other teachers, although I felt it was geared for upper grades."
1,Not my cup of tea!,"I had to get this book for a class, and I hated it. It is meant specifically for teachers with a background in reading strategies, and not for the general spectrum of application I was hoping for. It might be useful for the right teacher, but it was not for me."
4,easy read with quick interventions for vocabulary instruction,"I read this for a graduate class and found it to be a quick, easy read. The authors give you simple ways to enhance your vocabulary instruction. I would recommend this book to teachers at all levels but especially those working 3rd grade and above."
3,Bringing Words to Life,"While I appreciated the premise of the research outlined in this book, and have no doubt the approach recommended would be effective, I question the practicality for application in a classroom. It seems that it would take a considerable amount of planning and cumbersome documentation particularly with younger children or multiage classes. I plan to try to implement some of the suggestions and like the idea of working to help children establish their own definitions, moving away from traditional dictionary definitions that are only confusing for young students."
4,Bringing Words to Life,"Bringing Words ot Life is a great resource book for teachers. It is packed with great ideas, researched based instructional strategies, and even a few games. The most important point, I felt was your love for language is contagious. Your students will see how much you love words and through modeling and having a word enriched environment they will also have a love of language."
2,I really wanted to like it...,"After hearing ""Beautiful"" on the radio and really loving it, I decided to buy the entire cd thinking, ""Hey, if I like at least one song on the cd this much, I know I'll find something else I like.""Hmmm...I was wrong. A large majority of the songs sound pretty much the same (NOT like ""Beautiful"" either). Like I said, I bought it with a completely open mind, and this cd fell flat, very flat. And it wasn't just the music I didn't like, the lyrics were equally as bad. I found myself sitting in the car suffering through most of the songs, and finally had to turn it off completely so I could enjoy the drive.Don't waste your money. Borrow this one from a friend before you invest the $12."
3,Strong Release; Not As Good As These Reviewers Say,"Joydrop's Metasexual is a strong debut. However, reading the customer comments on Amazon one is lead to believe that this album is somehow earthshattering. The main page has all 5-star reviews!I didn't find this release quite that good. The track ""Beautiful"" is very much a stand-out track. The remaining tracks are mostly a Garbage-like sound with a definite Canadian Alanis Morissette influence.As Salon wrote recently, Musicians make much better actors than do actors of musicians. I predict a short run for Tara's pop music experiment; at least as a post-industrial vocal-vixen."
5,Joydrop offers a promising debut,"This cd is fantastic. Tara Slone has a great voice and the electronic edge of the music can be both catchy and dramatic. The single, ""Beautiful"", is the height of the album, exploding with power-pop goodness. While much of the material may remind you of Luscious jackson, or garbage, or even Ani DiFranco, the album itself still teems with originality."
3,they don't sound that much like garbage,"joydrop have added a few innovations to their album that pretty much define their own sound. i must admit that at time they have a bit of a ""garbage"" feel to them but it's a glaring aspect of their music that sticks out. tara is a very good vocalist and she has a style all her own. ""beautiful"" is just what is says. a good hard rock alternative song with great riffs in the chorus and cool transitions in between. the rest of the album goes in a bit of a lighter direction but they do just fine with that style as well. the drum loops and electronic elements really add to the feel of the album as well."
3,decent...not great,"this cd has one great song (beautiful) but when you get past that, it is just average. if you are looking for good chick rock, check out elastica."
4,un-expected easy listening,"It is not a bad CD, just not what I expected it to be. #'s 1, 2, 3, and 5 have noce bouncing beats but the rest of the CD is kind of a bore if you're not used to it. I would recamend this CD to anyone who likes the softer side of alternative because it's not worth much else."
4,Musical cliches - DONE WELL!,"Apart from ""Beautiful"", which comes very little short of being alternative rock brilliance, Joydrop presents a CD full of song stylings, riffs, and beats that do very little to separate themselves from the rest of the pack. However, the great thing about the CD is that Joydrop mixes up these cliches into a sound very well worth listening to and does them well as if mocking its predecessors. Reminiscent of Teri Nunn and Berlin. Check it out!"
5,Memories of Actual songs played at the Fabulous Playboy Clubs,"I remember going to the New York Playboy Club at 59th Street and lsitened to these Great artists, The Club is gone know but if you ever been to and want to revist some Great times Listen to these Great songs Long Ago."
2,Good Title,Opening the book and forcing myself to read its content didn't bring me very far. It seemed to me like a mere preparation for writing a book.
2,Only for the die hard fan,"If you are a die hard 'zilla fan who enjoys campiness in monster movies (like me), you'll enjoy this. I would've liked to have given it higher than 2 stars but I'm sure most people will hate it. Gigan keeps this film together. Without him, one of my favorite monsters, the movie would have done even worse. The recycled footage from Godzilla vs. Gigan and Destroy All Monsters (a must have) will annoy some. Basically, if you are a collector of sci-fi and monster movies you will get this movie no matter how bad you know it is, but if you are just delving into Godzilla, I recomend Destroy All Monsters, Terror of Mechagodzilla, or the original Godzilla: King of Monsters."
5,Thank you now release the last two,finally Godzilla Vs Megalon has been released ive been waiting for this to come out on DVD for years now all we need is Godzilla 1985 and Godzilla Vs Biollante!
4,Not bad,I like Godzilla movies and had been waiting forever for this one. Not too bad... typical 70's Zilla action with all the cheesy stuff I've come to expect (which was half the charm of those movies from that era).
3,Cheesey Kaiju fun!,"This is a highly entertaining film, even though by Godzilla standards it is one of the cheesiest! But the cheesiness makes for an entertaining experience! While not at all scary or preachy like the original Godzilla(1956), it has its moments! The dubbing is awful.......thankfully! It only adds to the entertainment! However, the kid's voice gets on my nerves! Godzilla is a hollow shadow of himself in this film. Even Anguiras is scarier! However, the redeeming point that saves the whole film and makes it a gem is the final battle scene! Hilarious! In the red corner, weighing in at well over 1,000 tons, Godzilla and Jet Jaguar! In the blue corner, from the farthest reaches of evil, the tag team champions, Megalon and Gigan! LOL Let's get ready to rumble! I won't say what happens but the big fight is really funny! Worth the price of the tape. Buy this if you like Kaiju( Japanese giant monster ) movies, or if you want a good laugh, but be warned! It's not for everyone!"
4,Megalon - Save Seatopia!,"I was thrilled that this feature in the Godzilla genre finally became available. The VHS copy I had was purchased as part of a two part tape - a horrible copy at best. The reworked disc is clear and it is great to be able to see it in Japanese as well. One of the most campy of the Godzilla movies - check out Gigan, Godzilla's Revenge and Destroy all Monsters to finish out this period - I promise you'll love them. The price is great, if you don't have a good copy or if by chance you are new to Godzilla flicks - add this to your collection."
1,still coming out?,Looks like this has gone from a pushed back release date...to no release date...and nobody here or on the web seems to have any idea if this is even coming out. Dissapointing to say the least.
3,Jet Jaguar go away!,"Probably the worst of all the Godzilla films but still fair for it's genre. The main botch? Focusing too much attention on the inferior Jet Jaguar. A character too cheesy even for a Godzilla film! Other than that, some pretty good fight scenes although they could have come up with something better than those awful silver toga wearing aliens. Blah"
4,Godzilla vs Megalon,I haven't seen this movie since I was a Kid. It was Fun to watch it again and it was how I remembered it. A fun Godzilla movie.
2,Godzilla vs Roach,This G flick was very bad next to godzilla vs Gigan.First offA giant Roach appears underground from septorians or whatever there called and started recking hell.You got Jet Jaguar anultraman reject very bad idea that fights the roach also.You got Gigan appearing out of no where and fighting both jet idiot and godzilla and duo to the finish.Basically this Godzilla movie sucks comparing to the others.Not to be harsh on this movie butits not good at all.
1,"Godzilla fights some monsters. (that's the plot, folks)","So the new Godzilla film had no plot, eh? Are you telling me this waste of time is what's meant by a plot? It's all just another aliens V humans and alien monsters V earth monsters. Gigan is still as uninspiring as ever, Jet Jaguar is the most dire monster ever in a Godzilla film and would be more at home in some execremental cartoon. Ghidorah seems to have been thrown in, just to keep the viewer's interest in this film, but his costume is showing its age. Half of this film just seems to be made up of stock footage from older Godzilla outings.An utter waste of time. I suppose this is what happens to every series when it runs out of steam. The producers aim it at their only remaining hope for an audience - undemanding kids. But to be honest even they'll be bored by this one."
1,THE worst Godzilla movie ever made!!,This movie is incredibly daffy. Godzilla teams up with robot Jet Jaguar to defeat Megalon and Gigan in the silliest battle yet caught on film.
2,The Second worst Godzilla Movie there is,I though Godzilla's Revenge was bad but this is pathiatic. This stinks. The only time that you see Godzilla is when the big fight comes and I couldn't say the big fight was really a fight I meen I've seen a lot better ones
4,Godzilla vs. Megalon,"I think it was not one of Godzilla's better films, but it still had the same story. Underground people want revenge on the earth. They then, unleash Megalon, a giant bettle with drills for hands, and it can also fly. Along with gigan, a giant birdlike monster, the two monsters start destoying everything. Then a sciencist's machine, Jet Jaguar grows to the size of the two giant deamons, and begins to fight them. Godzilla, soon joins the fight, and helps the giant version of Jet Jaguar. With the power of Godzilla's fire breath and Jet Jaguar's laser beams, they are able to defeat Megalon and Gigan. The earth is safe once more. I don't know way it's called Godzilla vs. Megalon, because Godzilla mostly fights Gigan in the movie. The film also borrows scenes from the preveous film Godzilla vs. Gigan, with the two monsters fighting the same battle. Nevertheless, it was an ok film, and is part of the Godzilla cult."
3,Big Coackroach vs. Ultraman reject and Godzilla,"I was a little dissapointed when I saw this movie because I was expecting alot more action than what it gave.As for the special effects they were pretty good for it's atleast to me.It's not as bad as what other people,but still only for hardcore G-movie collecters. Also Megalon has to one of cheesiest monsters yet.It also brings back Gigan."
2,This movie is extremely cheesy!!,"This movie is quite bad. Incredebly brain numbing bad!! Okay, Okay, I don`t think it`s quite that bad but it still isn`t that good. I don`t find the plot intresting at all and Jet Jaguar is an idiot!!! Plus in the end, Gigan flys away instead of dying. Godzilla also looks like a machine. I also really hate on how Jet Jaguar and Godzilla are friends. I mean, they`re always handshaking and doing stuff like that. I would rate this movie a one except for Godzilla`s dropkick scene that`s 100% Godzilla stlye. Otherwise, this movie stinks."
3,Second Best.,"Summary: Godzilla and a robot pal versus Gigan and a monster sent from the undersea kingdom of Seatopia.Almost as good as the previous film, ""Godzilla Vs. Gigan"". Above average monster effects and music help make this a stand-out of the Godzilla series.Next is ""Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla""."
3,Godzilla vs Megalon Update,"SciFi Japan is reporting that a bare bones edition (DVD not Blu Ray) will be released Aug 14, 2012. Media Blasters and Toho are still in negotiations over the content of the Blu Ray edition, so it will eventually be released. As to when is anybodies guess, but I will wait for the Blu Ray edition since I hate double dipping DVD's"
1,1 star? That's over-generous.,"It's quite unbelievable and frankly downright infuriating that potentially excellent films such as Rodan, the sixties Ghidrah and the original Godzilla film have never been released on video in the UK, and yet rubbish like this is staring out from every 'sf/fantasy' shelf in every video shop around.The plot, which to be honest isn't even up to the standard of the one in that wretched 1998 film, involves a race of aliens who are attempting to take over the earth with the help of their alien monsters. Well there's original.Once more Godzilla is called into action, along with Jet Jaguar, who has the dubious honour of being the most pathetic, uninspiring, yawnsome creation I've ever come across in a monster movie. The effects are pretty feeble, the fighting is nothing new or exciting and it all becomes very tedious.No wonder some people hate suitmation films if they can only judge them by watching trash like this."
3,Godzilla vs. Megalon,It was somewhat of a disappoint for my nephew and myself. We thought we were ordering a new godzilla movie since the release date was 2012. Here it was a rerelease of an older one.
1,One of the Worst,"This movie was simply bad. First of all, they used a lot of scenes from other movies and second of all, it was cheaply made. This movie and the smog monster has to be considered the worst Godzilla flicks of all. I would have to say that kids would probably like this movie, though."
1,Yuk,"With this movie, the Godzilla series hits bottom. The monsters in this movie are the worst ever. The model work that isn't stock footage is laughable. The battle choreography is unimaginative. The plot is awful. The script is even worse. The characters have about as much depth as the screen their shown on. Adding more insult and injury to a movie already brimming with both, Godzilla looks like something out of Sesame Street! It's not quite as tedious and stock-footage driven as Godzilla's Revenge, but it's a lot worse in all other respects. The campy humour may keep some engaged for the first few minutes, but by the end, the only way to maintain sanity is pondering how to murder Jun Fukuda."
1,a bad xerox copy,"This item is a xeroxed copy of the book. I don't think this would necessarily be a bad thing, but it is illegible. It more like a copy of a copy of a copy"
2,Initial Drive Looks Promising But Lacks Essentials.,"Initially, the Iomega CD-RW/DVD-ROM + 7-IN-1 seems to be a deal for its price. But once you get it out of its package trouble begins. While it offers compatibility with Mac OS X according to the packaging, it is not compatible with the system, and despite numerous attempts to get it to work properly, all I could do is burn CD-RW and not watch DVD's unless they were ripped onto the harddrive.As it is USB interface, it is slow, very slow.In addition, I own several flash cards of various sizes and not a single one would fit in any of the card ports this drive offers.If you are a pc user, then you might get it. If you are a Macintosh user, you would be better off buying a firewire based drive that is more compatiable and much more fast."
4,Bluetooth,"Not compatible w/ my Nokia N90. this product was displayed w/ the Nokia N90, but is not even compatible. pls change your picture as this is not the correct match.i kept the product anyway and just gave it to my dad.overall, svc was prompt and the item works. would still recommend.pls audit your Phone and Bluetooth compatibility. thanks"
2,How long have these been on the shelves?,"My son wanted to be Albert Einstein for Halloween (2006). The ""Einstein Heroes in History Kit"" seemed like a good way to get started on his costume. It contained a white wig and mustache. The wig was fine, but the glue on the mustache had dried up completely, leaving a flaky yellow residue on the back. Well, what's an Einstein costume without a mustache? I bought some eyelash glue ($4.50 for a little bottle), thinking that would solve the problem, but the strong smell wasn't exactly a hit with my 11 year old, and he ended up getting a big red mark over his lip when I tried to apply it. He had to wear a sign that said ""I'm Albert Einstein"" when he went trick-or-treating. I wore a wild brown wig and a sign that said ""I'm Einstein's mother"" when I gave out candy."
4,Einstein wig and moustache,"Had to use extra eyelash glue for the moustache, but otherwise it was a big hit!"
3,Functional,"This looked like a wig for a Golden Girl more than an Einstein wig. It was curly and shiny white. After a lot of brushing out, we got it close enough for our costume purposes."
2,Does not look like package picture.,Its a good wig. It just doesn't look anything like the picture on the package. It is basically a bright white curly clown wig.
4,Albert Einstein Costume Kit,We used this for our Christmas program. It isn't the highest quality but for the price it was perfect. I was impressed that the mustache stayed on our little actor even when she was playing with it.
2,Kinda awful,"I was very disappointed in this product, especially the mustache. It looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It's actually a tiny little rectangle with sparse fuzz on it. The wig is really curly, again the product photo was misleading."
2,"Good text, no links","There are several versions of Wesley's ""Sermons on Several Occasions"" on Kindle; I opted for this one because it was cheapest. However, there is no table of contents or any linked list to the sermons themselves. Since one typically does not read this sort of book cover to cover, but rather uses it as a reference, the absence of such a list is glaring. I returned it and went for a more expensive edition."
4,this was a really good movie,This movie was very creative the writer of this movie must have took alot of time to plan it out and to think how it was going to be made this was a really a interesting movie.
5,Great movie,"Great dealer, fast shipping, adorable movie. I have seen this movie, but it has been a while. It was just as cute as I remembered it was!"
5,So much fun! Great for the family library!,Read the book as a kid an enjoyed it. Have not seen the movie in over 10 years. Upgraded an old VHS copy to DVD for our family collection. Our kids - now adults - all lovesd seeing this again! We laughed so much! Bring on the popcorn!
3,"Not what we were expecting, but nice",This wasn't quite what we were looking for on a night with the grandkids but they tolerated it well. Would have hoped there had been an indication of the target age of the audience.
5,Still one of my favorites,"I loved this book as a child and the movie lived up to that experience. John Goodman is deliciously bad and ""House"" is, as always, wonderful. I used to imagine the Borrowers living in my home and this movie brought my childhood imagination to life."
2,"Not the Borrowers, but...","The only way to enjoy this film is if you haven't read the wonderful books by Mary Norton. The characters share the size, but few of the memorable traits of Pod, Homily, and Arrietty, the wonderful family that lives under the kitchen. This adaptation is more of a cross between MOUSE HUNT, HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS, and HOME ALONE than anything in THE BORROWERS books. I was very disappointed, and could not get involved in the story. For little kids only, although you should really read them the books and skip the film."
3,"movie version of ""The Borrowers""","Fun for our granddaughter, but not true to the book. I prefer the books."
5,family fare,Arrival was prompt. The movie was a great add to my collection and Brought back the memories from reading the book.
4,"Credible FX, Nice Movie","When this first came out, a decade ago, I thought it was the best job I had seen of making people look miniature. This showed how far technology had come in films and now, of course, we see a lot more amazing special effects.It was fun to view how these ""borrowers"" move about, using ordinary household items to propel themselves around a normal-sized house. It's all pretty ingenious.John Goodman plays a cartoon-like role, a role that is generally funny to watch. The cast has a mixture of American and English actors, with a setting of 1940s Britain. I first saw this on VHS and then later on DVD, which was improvement not only video-wise, but audio, too, as it somehow went from mono to surround sound.This might be considered a kids movie but a lot of the humor is more adult-oriented."
3,Good family entertainment,"This is a cute tale that's good family entertainment. The special effects are very good, and the acting is top-notch."
1,Too scary for childen!,"I read the book ""The Borrowers"" as a young girl and was delighted to find this movie. But this movie scared me big time, it freeked me out even more than the Harry Potter movies! it was scarier and creapier.It is not a bit like the wonderful book by Mary Norton,(with the exeption of the title and the Borrower's names)and was also a BIG disapintment. The charitors are lame, and so is the storyline. The book was funny and great, and even appriate for 2 year olds, But this movie is nothing but SAD,SCARY, AND DISAPINTING, not appopiate for children."
1,The Borrowers,I really liked this movie. I thought it was very funny. It also had 2 cast members who where later in the 2nd Harry Potter movie. Tom Felton (a very young Tom) and the guy who played Mr. Weasley. He was the exterminator. There was one part that I thought was falling down funny. I won't say what it was but it had to do with Tom Felton. He must have been about 7 or 8 years old in this movie. His name was Peagreen Clock.
4,Great family viewing!,A great movie to watch with the family! John Goodman was a great villain and made the movie hilarious! Good Stuff!
1,A girly voice and horrible lyrics,"Thankfully the sales figures show that this album has well and truly tanked. When I heard Paulatics for the first time I couldn't believe how bad it was. It was a cacophony of high-pitched, breathy whining, veering all over the place in the worst melody I've ever heard. Corey should stop writing his own stuff too cause his lyrics are terrible. The rhymes are excruciating enough to make any English teacher want to shoot him. From all the five star reviews he's gotten I can only conclude that all 20 of his fans have joined Amazon under 10 different e-mail addresses so they can leave more ridiculously inflated praise for him."
1,Corey Clark's debut release a FLOP!,Ok don't get my wrong Corey Clark is talented and can sing well but as mentioned above several of his tracks are overproduced and he sounds like a girl in some of them. Many of them are forgetable and some of them are incredibly inappropriate! I would recommend Justin Guarini's CD to anyone before I'd let them listen to Corey's. Don't get me wrong though Corey Clark has some talent it is just not shown on this album.
4,Surprising! A good listen.,"I didn't think I would like the cd as much as I do. Kanye West said this guy is for real talent-wise, so I decided to give it a listen. It is a very good balance of r&b, soul, and hip-hop. He didn't have to rely so much on controversy to sell a cd. This music stands alone and is quite good. The songs have excellent vocals, nice harmonies. One of those cd's you put in the player and just dance to."
1,Definintely a waste of money,"I should have known better than to waste my time on a cd by an Idol castoff/felon. Perhaps if he spent more time on the music and less time seeking cheap publicity it would have been a better effort. As a musician, it makes me cringe. The lyrics are trite, the dance tracks are overdone, his upper register on ballads is apalling.When i saw that he was trying to build a singing career by slagging off Paula Abdul and American Idol, rather than on the strength of his musical ability, I had a feeling that this effort would be useless. I was right...His 15 minutes of fame are over...time to slither back under the rock"
1,ANOTHER HORRIBLE IDOL OFFERING,"I can't believe this guy! I listened to this travesty at the Music Store where I work. It is truly horrible. He sounds like a cross between Michael Jackson and Dolly Parton. It makes you wonder how these kids are getting these record deals. God only knows. What I can tell you is this: At the music store where I work, we haven't sold one single product of his. Another thing, he looks like a pimp on the cover of the CD. I truly believe this guy will step on anyone or do anything to get what he wants. If you want class and good music, skip this one......why ANYONE would want to support this guy and his lame music is beyond my grasp and comprehension."
1,Avoid like the plague,This guy is a complete joke. Don't buy into the hype of that snoozefest American Idol. Support real talent.
1,The worst Amercian Idol CD I own,"As a fan of the Amercian Idol who favor in R&B, I had some hopes for Clark's CD, sadly my hopes were destroyed with this CD. Clark's voice is falestto which should have worked wonders on his cover of Debarge's All This Love,surpsinsgly it sounds horrible. The only song worth anything is his duet with Sarah Stokes (Makin The Band). One would think that if a CD has high profile superstar featured guest spots from the Black Eyed Peas, NE-Yo and Scott Storch it could be reedmed, sadly it isn't."
1,Isn't there a zero stars,"Okay...look at the cover...it should tell you one thing...take your time...as obvious as can be. Corey, you do not have to turn your back on American Idol, we have turned our back on you. Do not waste your money on this piece of trash. It would be better to light a match to your money. Weak attempt at fame and Corey's 15 minutes ran out years ago. Did he ever really have 15 minutes?"
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"Corey Clark's CD is a complete waste of time and money. The fact that he had to resort to making up lies and ruining peoples' reputations shows the kind of person he is and what lengths he'll go to for fame and money. Not to mention the fact that he cannot sing and hurts my eyes. Better luck next time, kid."
5,Excellent CD!!!!,"I loved every bit of the CD! His voice reminds me of DeBarge back in the day.... and It's so refreshing to hear someone that hits every note so well!!! His voice alone makes the CD very unique, I wish the best for this professional talent and I hope to hear more from Corey's God-Given talent! If people wouldn't get so caught up with the media and listened to the CD first hand opinions would change....This is a CD review NOT a news media review. Keep your head up Corey!!"
1,Monotonous...,"I had to force myself to listen to this dreadful piece of nonsense. It is one of the worst CD's i have heard all year, almost every track feels like a copy of something that Justin Timberlake and his like would come up with, but anyone else attempting it would achieve better results. That 'Paulatics' song is particularly ghastly, and the lyrics to it are appalling. It is quite clear that this man has no talent seeing as he has had to resort to slander in order to generate publicity for himself. I would highly recommend that you do not purchase this CD, your money would be better spent elsewhere."
1,"EXPLOITATION, THAT IS WHAT THIS CD IS!","What person in their right mind would buy into this type of exploitation, done by a felon and well known-liar?? I listened to this horrible collection at a used CD place because I wanted to see if there was anything at least palatable about his product? With songs like ""Feenie""....what the heck is this all about you wonder??? Please don't waste your time. The extremely distateful ""Paulatics"" is an example of this guy desperately needing some lessons in the ""depth perception"" department because he can't see the forest for the trees and is proof positive he is only using this as a step toward his 15 minutes of fame. The CD cover itself should tell you that he is no better than the ""pimps"" down on lower ""Broad"". And if that doesn't convince you, check the Billboard charts and the rest of the music charts where this CD is sinking faster than you can say ""Paulatics"". And all the phony five star reviews received here cannot change that fact!!"
1,Not worth a PENNY,"Corey Clark can NOT SING,..well...he can run his mouth good but that is not music. This has to be one of the worst cd's I have heard in a long time."
1,Corey Clark is AWFUL,"Wow, do you really want to waist your money on this liar? Yeah, Corey Clark deserves to fall off the face of the Earth. ""Fallen Idol"", hmmmm right ok, PAULA ABDUL IS FABULOUS AND COREY CLARK CAN GO DIE"
1,why oh why did I listen,"A co-worker had come and was talking to me about American Idol, and the issue with Corey Clark and Paula Abdul. Curious, I looked up the album and decided to listen to the songs. My co-worker and I both just sat and stared at the computer wondering how anyone could give it 3,4,or 5 stars unless you are a Michael Jackson fan and have been waiting for his new album. Corey's pitch is too high and annoying. Thankfully I did not purchase this album, I only wish that I had not listened to begin with."
1,This dude is REALLY sad.,He reminds me of a bufflao wing that Ruben Studdard ate the meat off of and threw in the garbage.
1,Not a good debut for Corey Clark...,"Honestly, I bought this CD mostly because of the amount of airtime he's received on TV recently. I don't really care about the Abdul thing, whether it's true or not, it's impossible to really tell. But, I bought this just to see if Corey actually has the talent to back up his TV coverage. He doesn't. This album is horrible, and every song feels like it's either ripping off another song entirely or it's meant for filler. For someone to take that long to release an album filled with garbage...it's very interesting.Basically, after listening to Corey's debut, I can say that whether he slept with Abdul or not, he's talentless and it doesn't really matter. Paula was crazy if she actually thought he was good. I'd say skip this album and go back to listening to your other stuff, because Corey most likely ripped it off already. Only one question really remains: who in their right mind signed this brat?"
5,Sensational,In mt life time there are few and far in between where you can hear an artist who can truly bring it to your heart. This artist can do that. He has genuine feelings that come across in his music. The clearity of his voice is haunting. The riffs are clear and precise. The background vocals are right on the money. I would not be suprised to see this cd hit the top 10. I for one recommend this to anyone who is serious about music
5,"If you're judging upon music, than this is a no brainer!",Simply amazing! One of the most diversified albums i've heard in years! YOu Should buy this album! period! Great job!
5,Hit CD,This cd has got to be the best I've heard in a long time. It has hit after hit after hit. When you buy this cd ( and I recommend that you do)You won't be disappointed. You can dance all day or just mellow out to the ballads. This guy is hot hot hot. What a powerful and soulful voice. The feeling that just crys out to you in each song is incredible! I have yet to be able to pick a favorite. There are just too many good ones to choose from. I highly recommend this to everyone!
1,I THOROUGHLY AGREE.....TRULY A DISASTER,"Mr. Clark's voice is whiny, pitchy going sharp and flat on most of the songs. Who gave this guy a record deal??? What were they thinking?? No way did I buy this. I just listened to it out of curiosity at the Blockbuster store which allows you to listen to the CDs before you purchase them to see if you like them. The production is terrible and the vocals.....well....I've heard hyenas who sound better than Clark does. I think he's just trying to cash in using any exploitative means possible and yes I am talking about the Paula Abdul scandal. The song ""Paulatics"" is in very poor taste which also goes for the rest of the CD. I feel very, very, sorry for people who are being taken in by this no talent scam artist."
1,Awful,I thought this cd was lifeless and boring. His voice was flat through most of the songs on this CD. The worst CD I've heard in a while. Paula forever!
5,Delightful suprise!,"What can I say Corey has the vocal skills! Ever since that season in American Idol I was routing for him all the way but unfortunately he got kicked off. But in the end I don't think that really mattered because now he's doing his own thing with the likes of music producer Scott Storch who has produced big records for 50 Cent and Beyonce. I must say this album has me very impressed every song has it's own agenda there's really good production behind this debut and Corey's vocals to match are like bread and butter. I definetely recommend this to album to anyone that can appreciate good R&B you won't be dissapointed!!! Notable favorites are Cherry on Top, That's My Girl, Lights Out, All This Love, Chance to Dance, So Many Questions, dang! the whole album is good!"
1,F- for this CD? How about a big fat ZERO???,This CD has flopped big-time. It has nothing to do with hate. It is just pure fact. Look at the amount of used CDs here on Amazon on sale for $1.58!! What artist with a new release has used CDs going for a dollar??? That ought to confirm that this CD has been a total disaster!! I hope this teaches Clark a lesson......don't step on people on your way up because they're the same ones you'll meet on your way down.
2,This Pretty Boy Needs to Chill and Get His Mind Together,"Look, Corey Clark is an attractive guy, alright? But he's not that attractive that I'd go out and buy his album. I actually forgot that he had an album come out this summer. The other day I was listening to Paula Abdul's ""Forever Your Girl"" CD and I was like, ""Oh, yeah! Corey Clark!"" Let me tell you something: this CD is wack! There's nothing unique about it and it's boring. I thought Corey sounded great on American Idol, but on this CD it's like he's singing underneath his breath and there's no emotion. The only song I like is ""All This Love"" and that's because I love the original by El Debarge. In fact, on that song Corey sounds similar to El, but he (Corey) sounds way off key, like he was bored or something. Like I said before, Corey is hot, but I would never pay $1.40 for his CD. For $1.40 I could buy 2 bags of onion rings, Gummi Savers, and a Slim Jim! Anyway, Corey's days of getting over are finished and good looks don't last forever."
1,A COMPLETE FIASCO,"This is a complete fiasco. Its not even music, just noise. I've heard better sounds coming from my garbage disposal. No wonder it flopped!"
2,For the price of $1.59?? Not bad for a CD that was just released!!,"I had high expectations for this CD which only proves that one should not hold high expectations in the music world today because of the let down that follows. With songs by the titles of ""Feenin"" (whatever the heck that is....) its no wonder this CD is being sold at used marketplaces for $1.00. I agree, the bottom line is the music. And in this case, it is overall bland with no distinctive quality either vocally or production-wise. If you want to buy it the only place I've seen it available is here on Amazon and the used sellers for $1.59. Not bad for a CD that was just released."
1,ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS IN MUSIC HISTORY!,"This CD is very lame. If its so good, why was he dropped from his record label? Why has the CD sunk lower than Justin Guarini's? I thought Guarini was bad but this guy is in for some big disappointments. And not because of the ""Paula"" thing. Who cares about that nonsense??? The matter of fact is the music. Is it good or not? These lyrics are banal and trite and the melodies and production values are downright overproduced and mawkish. Add to this an unimpressive voice with a CD cover that reminds one of....oh, never mind....forget Corey Clark."
4,I Just So Happen to LIKE Corey Clark!!,"Contrary to popular belief, I like this album. I'm not saying that its the greatest of all time or anything, but is very soothing to the ears. the music is very nice and goes well with Corey's falsetto. Generally, I have a 3-song rule in regard to whether i should keep a Cd or not and fortunately, i like most of the songs on this Cd. In spite of the Corey-Paula controversy, ""Paulatics"" is one of my favorites on this cd. I thought Corey's version of ""All This Love"" was superb to say the least. If u are in need of hearing some smooth grooves, i highly recommend Corey Clark!"
2,Nothing but fake reviews on this album,"I heard parts of this album and it's nothing special - pretty mundane and uninteresting all the way through, certainly not something I'd pay for. The most hilarious thing associated with Corey Clark's album are the dozens of five star ratings here on Amazon, all sounding amazingly similar, even using the same vocabulary over and over again. Also, click on the ""see my other reviews"" links for all these fake reviews and you'll notice this is the only album they've ever reviewed. Very very lame. It tells you something about the album, the fact that Corey Clark has to get everyone he knows to post fake reviews. It can't stand on it's own - it basically sucks, but all the fake reviews are hilarious, you've got to read every one that gives it a five star rating. Sounds like the same person wrote all of them. Corey Clark is ""so refreshing"" and ""hits every note"" and the ""harmonies are AMAZING!"" and he's the ""second coming of Michael Jackson!!!"" Hilarious stuff."
2,So So Album,"Okay. Nevermind the ongoing debate over whether you like Corey Clark as a person or not. I am a fan of the show and therefore buy all the CD's that the contestants release. I like some of them, I dislike some of them and so it goes.I bought this album with an open mind. I actually wanted to like it. I have to agree with the people that say that the songs sound largely the same. He has a great voice, however, the music is not that great. The majority of the tracks have the same beat with different words. I was very disappointed.That said .. I will buy any follow up CD that Corey puts out and hope I like it better. Whomever produces the CD should taylor songs to Corey's strengths and vocal style. They just fell short this time."
3,Good CD,"I like most of the songs on this cd, which is more than I can say for some established artists who have new cds out this year. It has good song writing, and Corey Clark's vocal skills are well displayed. The only problem I have with this album is that a few of songs sound alike. The words are different, but the beat is the same. Maybe now that he has a cd out, Clark can get the attention of more talented producers. I am disappointed that he's not getting any airplay here in Detroit. The majority of the songs on this cd are good enough to be in heavy rotation. Most of the songs are as good if not better than most of what's heard on radio now. Clark reminds me alot of El Debarge in look and in sound. I was disappointed that he went for an obvious remake of a Debarge classic. That's my honest review of this cd. I hope that others will be as honest and not use a review as a forum to take sides between Clark and Paula Abdul. I bought the cd, I don't intend to sell it."
2,Corey Clark - American Idol Contestant,I am disappointed in Corey Clark's new CD. Corey Clark is a very talented artist. This CD does not do his voice justice. When he performed on the American Idol Show I thought his voice was amazing. His choice of songs on the show were great. His voice does not come through very well on this CD. I hope that he will continue to make music and sing songs that will show off his voice. The CD itself was done very nice.
1,A WASTE OF MONEY,"Someone gave me this album, I would not have bought it, but listened to it. It is simply horrible. I support Corey in his effort to clear the air with AI so that does not play in it- I agree with him totally on that- but this is a terrible album- why not just throw your money out the window? That is basically what you are doing because you won't be hearing it more than twice because it is unlistenable- awful. I am going to use the CD case as an ashtray because I hate not to get some value out of it."
1,sad joke really screw this clown,abnother american idol reject who had his 15 minutes of fame and is now a hasbeen.
2,"Could have been a updated version of Debarge, but................","Dude decided to air dirty laundry, bring down a established 80's pop star who judges the number one show in America. Dummy!"
1,I AGREE WITH THE ONE STAR REVIEWS,"Folks, this young man is another example of ""exploitation"" in the music business. This CD is a prime example of this. Please do not buy into this kind of titillation in the music business; I for one will not endorse Corey Clark in any of his undertakings. He is a bad example for young people today and the lyrics on this CD more than confirm that fact. Who ever thought to give him a record deal anyhow? If you want wholesome, decent, music, look elsewhere. You will not find it on this CD. Don't buy into this propoganda of exploitation and evil!"
2,Every song sounds the same...,"Every song on this CD seems to sound the same. It's like 15 tracks of the exact same song writing formula. There's a few songs that I liked, but nothing I plan to run back to anytime soon. Corey has such a great ability with his voice - to sing in a wide range, which makes me wonder why the heck he sounds like a woman on every song. He always had that great high register, yes, but he wasn't ONLY the high register on American Idol. This CD is very boring."
1,No Wonder Its On Sale for $2.95 Used,"$2.95 for Corey's CD...used....here on Amazon? No wonder, given the likes of the mediocrity displayed therein. The reviewer below failed to mention the ruckus Corey recently caused at a restaraunt. And if his CD has failed to chart, its because #1) His motives are apparent and indeed He is an opportunist, #2) He is not being promoted because of his reputation and because the CD is poor quality with stupid songs that only appeal to the lust-filled, oversexed crowd! Corey's 15 minutes of fame are over!! Accept it and move on!!"
1,A Good Dollar Rental,"If I rented ""Bangkok Adrenaline"" for a dollar, I would say I got my money's worth. True, some of the fighting is entertaining.... mostly, the acrobatic antics of the kid who does parkour are the high points of the movie... but the story languishes, and the copious humor is sophomoric. PS: If you care, the girl does NOT dress like she dresses on the DVD cover. Pick up District B13 or the original Ong Bak instead."
2,Dissapointing,I throught this would of been an awesome movie turned out to be one of the worst movies ever Dmx didn't do much and to be honest i just wanted to turn the film off. C'mon guys get your stuff together and get back to making real action films
1,One star may be a gift,"I really like Kris Kristofferson but he was old, fat and slow and all the actoring was bad. The lines sounded trite and sounded as if they were being read. It hurts me not to give Kris 5 stars but as policemen they were so over the top it seemed like a high school play. The black cop who also is normally great shot and killed everyone he met with no punity. The dark photography helped the movie since it hid the poor photography. SORRY"
2,Only 10 pages of coloring,"This is fun and great idea for toddler who can't color very well. But it's very costly since there are only about 10 special made pages that the invisible pen can drew on. Once your toddler is done with those 10 pages, then this book and pen is useless."
3,Misleading Advertisement,"I ordered this product because it said the product was Betsey Johnson by Betsey Johnson for Women. Set-eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 oz & BODY LOTION 6.7 oz. When I received the product, it was actually the parfum spray and SHOWER GEL. I was very disappointed that it was the SHOWER GEL and not the BODY LOTION as advertised. Since I love this perfume, I decided to keep it since it is scarce these days. I now have to track down the lotion."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"This movie has nothing to offer - it's not funny, not entertaining and not action packed. The only reason to watch it would be to see the three lead women nude - they aren't even topless!!! The idiot director, writer producer who made this pile of garbage needs to have his head examined - it's against the laws of nature and man to have three nice looking women and not have them take their clothes off. The movie is a complete waste of time - do not watch it."
2,An unfunny comedy,"If you like watching young women beat the crap out of men for being rude (!) you might enjoy this. Otherwise, there's no real point in watching this. Don't expect any big laughs or any exciting moments. The sound is badly synchronised with the actors' lip movements. I don't know if this is supposed to be funny, like a parody of dubbed ninja movies from Asia.It would be fun to see such a film with reversed gender roles some time. Three young men assaulting middle-aged women for not showing them proper respect. Not because I enjoy watching women getting beat up, but to see the reaction from society. For some reason, women's violence against men is more hilarious than vice versa. Often, like here, it's even justified.I almost forgot. Are you thinking of buying this movie because the three gorgeous girls work part-time as strippers? Don't. They're not even topless."
2,Not as good as I thought It would Be,Not much of a movie at all. I only purchased it to see Michael Pare' and he is wonderful in it.Too bad the movies isn't..
4,"Pretty decent, much better than Cheerleader Ninjas","April, Courtney and Monica are students by day, go-go dancers and ninjas by night.It is what it is, a cute parody of action and exploitation films. The girls are sexy, the plot is silly, the nudity is brief (and does not involve the 3 main girls).George Takei's performance as their sensei is particularly good.Ninja Cheerleaders is fun and light and just the thing if that's what you're looking for.Watch out for the similarly named Cheerleader Ninjas, which is not nearly as good."
1,Keep looking for it...,"I've enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's writing in the past, but this story is poorly written, poorly edited and extremely shallow. I couldn't help but think that Ford was just cranking out a story to meet a deadline. There's no depth of character in any of the main figures. The story line seems to serve no purpose other than to connect the over abundant and graphic sex scenes, some of which are extremely brutal. If your looking for a good story with believable characters...keep looking for it."
2,Disappointing,"Given that I enjoy Mr. Ford's essay collections and other writings, I was really looking forward to this book. I won't recap the plot here, since other reviewers have done a good job of that.As other reviewers have pointed out, it's an easy read, a ""beach book,"" as it were. But in the end, I found the story contrived and unrealistic, the characters without much depth, and the writing clunky and mechanical. It wasn't completely unenjoyable, but I would have expected better from such an experienced and prolific writer as Mr. Ford.He does create a good sense of the story's setting and location, and I rather liked Simon, the eldest member of the cast. The erotic passages are well-written but their explicitness seems very out of place. Overall, Ford has a tendency to use 10 words when half that number would suffice."
2,Could Have Been So Great,"Although I read the entire book, I found it more depressing than enjoyable. I enjoy gay and lesbian fiction, but there was so much unnecessary sex in this book that it took away from the actual story line.The scenes with Pete Thayer, a blatant homophobe who harbors homosexual tendencies, were especially explicit and, in some cases, disgusting, and I felt they did nothing to explain his beliefs and his character.There are lots of good fiction books out there dealing with gay men, but LOOKING FOR IT isn't one of them."
3,Baldwin's book is a concise christian oriented commentary.,"Baldwin's book is a concise christian oriented commentary on the Book of Samuel. Baldwin's book is for the reader who wants a quick reference to better understand the Book of Samuel 1 & 2. However, the academic may become a little perturb when reading the book because Baldwin on occasion proselytizes. Baldwin undoubtedly has a firm understanding of not only the Book of Samuel, but also the bible in general. I would recommend the book to anyone who is attempting to quickly understand some of subtleties contained in the Book of Samuel, however, I am sure there are more thorough commentaries published for the more serious of mind."
3,1&2 Samuel : An introduction and commentary,"Good analysis, but due to its publication date doesn't include upto date historical and archaeological information"
1,So bad I skipped to the end sequence.,"Going by the title, I decided to watch this flick thinking it would be good for a laugh. The only shot I saw that did make me laugh was the first shot of the gigantic shark's fin as it passed the ship. It wasn't well rendered which made it more laughable. I'm amazed that someone thought this film was good enough to produce and feed to the public. The lead actor was terrible, way too hyped up and over-the-top, like maybe he'd consumed a dozen Red Bull drinks all at once. The CG effects were 2nd or 3rd rate at best. After the first 15 or so minutes of viewing, I started skipping ahead until I arrived at the end sequence, for the final battle between the shark and croc. If you want to watch a really bad B or maybe C film, this is a good example."
4,"Insane, and very entertaining.","This standalone sequel to ""Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus"" is insane. It's got ridiculous characters, awful special effects (although there are some scenes where the crocodile looks pretty good) and some of the most absurd giant monster scenes I've ever seen. If you're looking for quality or big budget filmmaking, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for some cheesy low budget monster madness, ""Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus"" pulls no punches and provides it in spades."
3,Hope The Asylum steps up their game,"Okay, I like The Asylum's giant monster mash, but this is a couple steps backwards from MSVGO or Mega Piranha. The film fumbles on it's own internal logic, we don't have any titillation and our hero is the actor formerly know as Urkel. The Asylum need to step up their game, as Roger Corman is hot on their trail with Sharktopus."
1,"Edward D. Wood, Jr. ..... Step Aside","My 8-yr. old son rented this DVD, with my (unwitting) wife's permission. We watched it to the bitter end (I didn't want to crush my son's feelings).This was the single-most awful movie-watching experience I have ever had; I had to bite my lip to keep from constantly laughing.The script, the special effects, the action, the acting, the dialogue (I could go on) were about as bottom-of-the-barrel as you can get.Watching this movie made me think back on other movies that I thought were crap; this movie makes one realize how bad ""bad"" can really be.If more than 50,000 was spent making this movie I'd be in shock.The characters went from Africa to Miami, then Orlando, then Aruba, Hawaii, etc. as if they were hop-scotching on sidewalk sections (do the directors understand the concept of geography).If you're thinking of buying this turd, you have my sympathies"
3,URKEL ROCKS THE BOAT,"Jaleel ""Urkel"" White an action hero?!!!That alone should prepare you for what to expect in this latest Z movie from The Asylum: cheesy effects, inane dialogue, bad acting and horrible direction---and it's an enjoyable hoot!The franchise is obviously growing: Mega Shark vs. Squidosaurus? Mega Shark vs. Giant Jellyfish? Moby Dickosaurus? The possibilities are endless.But keep em cheap!"
3,Urkel joins the Navy,"Ah another cataclysmic clash of the titans from our old pals at ""the Asylum."" An almost direct sequel to the immortal Mega-Shark Versus Giant Octopus (No Deborah Gibson this go-round), Mega-shark versus Crocosaurus builds itself up to be one of those old time monster vs. monster vs. Earth movies from years gone by. Much like its predecessors (Godzilla vs. King Kong or Wolf-man vs. Dracula) the movie shies away from giving a truly definitive victor. The 3-star review I award is based on comparison with other Asylum movies as they truly are an art-form onto themselves. For an Asylum movie this one is pretty good. Long looks at the title creature-stars, decent performances from the cast,and the usual goofiness from extremely loose scripting and general absurdity. So three stars it is. Here's hoping that the end of credits scene might lead to another Mega-shark sequel."
3,Decent Monster Mash,"Mega Shark vs. Crocosaurus (say that 3 times fast) is a SyFy channel orginal movie, and I'd say it's one of the better ones. Although, that's not really saying much. We all watch these movies hoping that one day there will be one that's as good cheesy fun as we hope it will be, but more often than not SyFy channel originals are average at best. Anyway, I was really impressed by the giant crocodile in this movie. It looks great even though it's CGI and it causes a lot of destruction, even destroying buildings. The shark didn't impress me that much, though. It doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, and it just didn't look great to me. There is fun to be had while watching Mega Shark vs. Crocosaurus, but not as much fun as Mega Python vs. Gatoroid, which just premiered last week on the SyFy Channel and doesn't have a DVD release date scheduled yet."
1,Outrageous,"No level of low budget can be used as excused for such a blatantly mean enterprise. Everybopdy involved in this novelty should be sued, hehe, so atrociously bad it is,. Not ""so bad it's good"". No, just bad, kind of ""worst movie of all time ""bad.It's terribly edited, terribly acted. Let's not even talk about the ""un"" special effects"". And there are people who say this is good, because you get what you expect. No. It's simply a mean spirited movie."
4,Life on the Prarie,"I would recommend this book to girls in the fifth or sixth grade. I would recommend this book to girls in the fifth or sixth grade because this is mostly a girl book and I think boys would get board during a book. Also, I think fifth or sixth graders would like this book because this is a cute book and it is cool to learn how people lived back then, then compare it to the life we live now. The author put in really descriptive words that could paint a picture in my head and feel like I was in the story. If you read this book, you would want to read the next book because you want to see what happens next. If you don't like one book, you'll probably like the next one because the story is an adventure for you every time and, the book matures as you read more of the series. I would give this book a four (4) star."
4,The Little House on the Prairie,"I am a sixth grader. I chose to read this book because when you look at the cover you can see what the book was about I loved the way the author ""Laura Ingalls Wilder"" explained what was going on in her own words. The main characters in the book are Laura, Pa, Ma, Mary and Baby Carrie .On the second or third page of the book there was a timeline that determined the people in the Ingalls family. On their voyage through the old country times they run along many troublesome times, they get through them. In the book there are Indians and they moving through different territories every year. The reason I would give this book 4 stars is because I like adventures and old books like this. There is a whole series of this book. I've read the first, second, and third. These were many reasons why I chose this book to read. I think you should read it too !!!!!"
3,I liked this book because ...,"I liked this book because it made me feel the heat and cold of the seasons. I also liked the hardships they over come like wolves, indians, and disease. My favorite charecther is Laura because she is stubborn like my sister. I also like Laura because she grew up to write books almost like a diary of her child hood. I would recommend this book."
2,Little House on the Prarie Unabridged CD,"I purchased this CD for my grandchildren to listen to while riding in the car. Since they travel a lot, they usually make very good use of cd's. They could hardly hear it and listened to it for only a short time. Because it was mailed directly to them it is difficult to return. I will never try a LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE CD AGAIN."
1,disappointed,"I was disappointed in the color edition of Little House on the Prairie. It was too small, the coated pages were unpleasant to the touch, and the color obscured the lovely black and white drawings."
4,Not as good as the first one,"This book gives a very realistic view of a young white girl living in the time and place that she did. Laura and her family were, at times, kind of racist against the native Americans. When I first read this book, I was very dissapointed at that but now I realized that Laura was just a very ignorant girl who has been taught to fear them. So if you read this book, you should understand that these people lived in a very different world from us, not just in terms of electricity and modern inventions, but also socially. Anyway, apart from being slihjtly racist, I just don't like this book as much as Little House in the Big Woods but it's still pretty good for young kids."
3,"It's okay, would have prefered a different ""voice""","We love these books and have read them many times. As this seems to be the only offeringof CD's available I would definitely reccomend them. But as to the reader..Cherry Jones, wehad a very hard time finishing it. Her ""childrens"" voice is very grating and not realisticand her singing...oy vey!"
3,If only a different voice,"I LOVE this series and was so happy to find the audio cd at the library. However, the reader has that distinctively kiddie lit voice that sounds like it should be reading Ramona the Pest, not Laura Ingalls.I am still looking for a dramatized version of Big Woods and Little House that I heard on an LP from a college library. It featured Sarah Jessica Parker, when she was very young, as the voice of Laura, and was SO true to the style of speaking--and Pa's voice was fabulous.We actually couldn't finish this cd read by Cherry Jones, because of the speaking voice. Sorry!"
3,Not as good as previous version,"I teach 5th grade and I purchased these books to complete my class set of these books. This new version is missing all of the wonderful sketches that made Laura's books famous. Why? The font is also smaller and the page numbers are different, making it difficult for the kids with this version to follow along. I'm most upset though at the lack of the illustrations that children have come to love since Laura wrote these books. Disappointing. Get the older version (without the photograph on the cover) if you can get it."
4,Great Story,It was a great book I loved all the details and I also liked how realistic it sounded. I personaly think it is a great book for girls and boys. It is a book for people who like adventure stories.
5,Great stuff that will make you think,"This book is very simple and interesting. The need to pull up roots and travel to an unsafe destination, to build a house and barn, to trade furs for seeds, and then pull up roots again based on a rumor seems a very sinister backdrop to the pleasant life of two young girls. This book helps me understand better the american roots of religion, independence and the right to keep and bare arms. It also is a snapshot on how the white people pushed the indians to acts of desperation and how the indian ""problem"" was understood by the white settlers. All this, plus a very pleasant read for young children who are strangers to hardship and sacrifice. Great stuff. How america has changed in one hundred years!"
1,a sure cure for insomnia,"in 4th grade I unfourtunetly had to read this book and let me tell you, I have sleeping problems and this has been the only book that LITERALLY caused me to fall asleep."
2,"Not Exciting, not thrilling, just an OK Book","Though from the descripition it seems amazingly boring, but it is kind of charming in an offbeat way. It describes the Ingalls family going out west (to Kansas, to be specific) and settle there because the Big Woods was getting too crowded. I thought it as OK, but there was no thrilling or excciting bits, or parts when the plot suddenly turned dark.I recommend this book only to kids under the age of eight and kids who have not read the Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl series. For lovers of fantasy, mystery, magic or science-fiction, you must turn elsewhere for a good read."
1,Boring,I think this book was very borring because it explains things that arn't very intresting. There was a whole chapter on how Pa built a chair! I don't recamend it to any reader
4,my all time favorite!,"I purchased this CD so that my fourth-graders could listen to this while they were following along in their book. It is great! This is one of my all time favorite Laura Ingalls books in her series, so was glad to see Amazon had it on CD."
3,Recommended with reservations,"I loved this series of books as a child and read them countless times. I am amazed at how many things I still remember from them, particularly the portions describing how things were done or made. This particular book was one of my least favorite since it is a bit slow. In addition, I was uncomfortable with the depiction of Native Americans even as a child. I am currently reading this book to my 4 1/2 year old, since we recently drove out to Colorado and have been able to compare some of what we saw to the descriptions of the landscape in the book. I have been skipping at least some portions of chapters such as the one on building a door. I have also edited (ok censored) some of the negative comments about Native Americans. Its hard not to convey some of the negativity though, so I'll be looking for a book or 2 to show us a different perspective."
3,"""It has a good beat and you can dance to it!""","Maybe I'm being a bit facetious with my title, but for what it is, this is an enjoyable CD. Of course any time you put together this wide of an array of performances you're going to end up with some chaff among the wheat and while there are a couple of less than brilliant recordings here - Ahronovitch's ""Anitra's Dance"" is not exactly seductive or splashy, though is is well recorded - the vast majority of selections are more than adequately done. At its ridiculously low price this is easily recommendable, especially to newcomers to classical music. They might find out how much fun it can be!"
3,Nice book but not good enough,"Hi, I think this book is interesting. It talks about a girl wanting to know more about Cuba, and how she gets involved in their family tradition of having a 15th years old birthday in which in Spanish they call it ""Quinceanos"".The book is interesting but not as good as others.Personally I like to read Harry Potter more than any other books. I read Cuba 15 just to try it but wasn't that good as i expected.Bye."
2,Never ending book,I wouldn't reccomend Cuba 15. I often found myself skipping paragraphs and getting bored while reading. It included unescessary events and dragged on for forever. The ending was dissapointing and abrupt. I was let down by this book.
4,Cuba 15 is a hit with a former quiceanera,"Having had the traditional quince party, it brought back memories. Quiceaneras celebrations in 2010 are much different. I had a traditional quince, but with all the hassles no less. A fun read, specially if you are a ""Cuban."""
1,joeytheghost,"When this book gets down to a price that makes it viable as kindling for my fire place, I will buy it.Written by a certifiable nut case for other ""Christians"" who confuse Christ with fascism...Quality of binding and paper quality is all that I can think of to recommend it."
1,Brang It!,"(...)His latest tome, however, is rather uninteresting. It's filled with the same type of generic, pre-written Q and As that the erstwhile televangelist fields from gushing audience members on his show, (...) 700 Club! If you're looking for predictable answers to life's probing questions from a multi-millionaire preacher who claims that God speaks directly through him, then this is the book for you."
5,Biblical answers to everyday dilemmas,"This book is valuable to anyone who wonders what God's word says about everyday problems and situations. In this book, Dr. Robertson shares with the reader his wealth of knowledge on many subjects. He covers marriage, family, health, finance and many other subjects with not just Biblical wisdom but also with common sense, 21st century revelance. I would recommend this book for anyone, not just as a ""once read"" but as a handbook one can refer to again and again."
4,Great textbook,"It certainly helps one understand much better how to work with children and provide techniques. However, I think it is because I used this with my Child Therapy class in graduate school so I can utilize this book to its fullest potential. If you're just reading it, it might be hard to practice some of the techniques because it might be as obvious. It's not the best written piece but the author is definitely knowledgeable."
3,Helpful,Great if your looking for someone's opinion on art to build rapport and get to know a child during therapy. No data given to prove its effectiveness but tons of examples of using it effectively.
4,Was Shaw gay?,"Was Shaw gay? Dr. Peters builds a convincing argument that he probably was and that he used his vast intellect to erect every possible defense against his homosexual leanings ever coming to sustained expression. I thought I knew Shaw but I will never again look at him again now that I have read this provocative volume. I am giving it only 4 stars, however, because even my interest (and I am a fan of Shaw) could not be sustained for the entire length of this discussion of Shaw's romances/flirtations/avoidances."
1,Does not work with Apple iPod,"My PC freezes when I plug my iPod USB cable into the CBU2U USB 2.0 PC card, and I have to power cycle it. Other devices work fine, such as a Microsoft optical mouse, and a Sony digital camera. My PC is a Dell Inspiron 2500 with 384 MB RAM, 10 GB hard drive (2 GB free), and Windows XP Pro SP2 with all Windows updates. The CBU2U is using the standard XP driver. I sent e-mail to technical support and did not get a response."
5,Let Santo and Johnny steel you away!,"You will love this CD. You will play it over and over again. Santo Farina and Johnny Farina are brothers born in Brooklyn, New York. The first tune on this CD is their first national hit ""Sleepwalk"". Here you will hear how well Santo and Johnny have mastered the steel guitar. You have hear ""Sleepwalk"" probably in a movie a time or two. It also sounds like ""beach music"". Sounds great on your tv set if you own a Playstation One to play it on. You can play this CD while you are in the bathtub for relaxation. It also sounds great for a party.Other good tunes that sound moody by Santo & Johnny are: Tear Drop, Summertime, Twistin' Bells, I'll Remember (In The Still of the Night), Over The Rainbow, Venus, Deep Purple, Blue Moon, Tenderly.There are 24 tunes in all and many of them recorded in ""Stereo"". This is the very best of Santo & Johnny."
4,Santo and Jonny review,I like the music fine. However it isn't a GOLD as the AMAZON advertisement states. I would rather have had a GOLD copy.
4,Santo & Johnny were not asleep!,"I Ordered The Santo and Johnny CD because ""Sleepwalk"" wasso Good! I found the album to be a full Musical Spectrum ofSteel Gutar Instrumentals, Some Standards and Originals.To me ""Teardrop"" Was a great follow up. I enjoy listeningto the CD and Reccomend it to all Santo and Johnny Fans.Even if your not, you will be...DougFrom Riverside Ca."
4,Santo and Johnny,Excellent album but disappointed in title track - Sleepwalk. The start of the track seems too abrupt like the first intro note has been missed or interfered with. My favourite track on this CD is Venus. It is a pity that these two brothers and their sister did not record and write more music.The Best of Santo & Johnny
5,Sleep Walk,Love this album...these guys werereally great...if you can deal withtremedously cool instrumental music...you will love this! Slide guitarmusic..like it has never been playedthen or now!
2,Nostalgia isn't what it used to be,"The only reason I bought the CD was for Sleepwalk. That's the only legitimate top 10 hit on the CD (at least for Santo and Johnny). The rest of the songs are ok, but pretty much a repetition of the same sound."
1,Rough beginnings,"This Cd is like the Beatles with Tony Sheridan. It's a VERY early version of a band that would become great.Ratcity in Blue is a better idea of how these guys are, as is Live at Last. I would definately skip this one, unless you want to have all their albums."
2,A let down,"I was disappointed in this book, it remind of the old ""5000 Guitar Grips"" books with lots of raw info, but nothing on usage. I think there is a lot of info buried in the book, but there really isn't any examples to help the reader understand how to apply. I think if the author would take book and add some examples showing application the book would be great, but without it it's going to collect dust for most."
1,MTV: Music for the Numb,"The mixing is horrible, no skills at all. The songs are all pop which have the INC. next to them. Phuck MTV. Come on people, open your ears and listen to music that gives life not depression. -Dj NuYorikan Seoul"
4,So helpful!,"This book is great for anyone new at drawing flats and specs, or if you have been in the industry for years, it is a great brush up. I have also taken a class by one of the authors and she made flats easy...just the way the book does it!"
5,Excellent Resource for those with patterndrafting experience,"The Spec Manual is an excellent resource guide for fashion students and designers looking for reference. The book includes accompanying CD that contains about 2/3s of the flats and models in digital format, including grid paper and spec sheet samples. The book includes sections for men, women, and children, and has most of your basic spec sheets laid out for everyday clothing like pants and skirts as well as shirts and jackets. The tables and charts are helpful for those starting to understand the relationship of the fit clothing to making and how to quantify it to spec sheets, although it is a reference manual not a step by step instruction so further understanding or education is required that you won't find in the book that you would find in a patternmaking book."
1,Cans were dented,"For some reason, you took the cans out of the plastic wrap provided by the manufacturer and put them in a box where they knocked against each other and were damaged."
2,Poor selection of highlights,"Surely, if one is making a selection of highlights from Macbeth, especially if the recording includes the controversial Sylvia Sass, it goes without saying that the sleepwalking scene should be included. Yet this recording omits it! Instead one in treated to nearly half an hour of purely orchestral music (overture, the dance of the witches, etc etc), with minimal exposure to Sass, Cappuccilli and Christoff. The bits that are there, are good, but the interminable filling-in music makes this a very disappointing CD.The other recording of highlights where Sass also sings the part of Lady Macbeth, conducted by Previtali, is a far better buy."
5,a book that truley takes you soaring,this book truley takes you soaring from colorful beauty to ugly beasty hag!!! 5 stars to grame base!!!
4,Base's Masterpiece,While Graeme Base has recieved much acclaim over other books like Animalia this is really the greatest thing he's written. The book is loaded with Australian humor that must be read several times for the jokes to be understood. The book is divided into 3 sections chronicling 3 famous serpentologists(someone who studies dragons). Each section has 4 letters written by that serpentologist with a massive picture of the dragon in question. There is two reasons why I haven't given this 5 stars. One because it should be formatted less as a story and more factual and two because the 18 dollar price tag is outrageous. Base should really write more about this subject because he's really in his element here.NOTE: While this is considered a 'picture book' it is not for anyone under 10 years old(and not many 10 year olds will get it either).
4,Certainly the best of the series.,"(Previous entry ""Godzilla Vs. the Smog Monster"")Summary: Godzilla and Angilas must save the Earth from Ghidrah and Gigan.By far the best Godzilla movie ever made. Excellent monster effects, musical score, and above average script and acting help make this Godzilla's finest film to date.Next is ""Godzilla Vs. Megalon""."
2,"Bad, but not agonizing","Godzilla vs. Gigan isn't a good Godzilla movie by any stretch of the imagination. It isn't even an OK Godzilla movie. But having been made a few years after the horrific Godzilla's Revenge and immediatly before the insipid Godzilla vs. Megalon, it comes across as a breath of breathable, if not fresh, air. The plot is standard for the time and fairly unimaginative, and the characters are truly awful. The monster action is at least fairly entertaining, but the only really good part is Akira Ifukube's score, the hearing of which can cause you to forgive a lot of the movie's sins. The final fight scene, unfortunatley, is the worst bit of the monster action, being too slow and dull to really stir anything. Bottom line: watch it, but only if there are no better Godzilla movies available."
2,Not too good,"I am the biggest G fan in the world, but this one just stinks. Megalon, G's Revenge and Spacegodzilla are worse, but not by much. The economy in Japan at the time was horrible, so little money was used to make the 70's G movies. Stock footage was used also. Of course for all Godzilla fans, there are cool cheesy action sequences, and Gigan was a nice creation, but the story and overall production of the film was not good at all. And Godzilla actually speaks!"
1,Two thumbs Down!,Gigan was good but the toy on strings Ghidrah and the aliens and guy drawing pokadot monster thing was stupid! And also....Godzilla talks? Give me a break! It sounded like some old guy mumbling.
3,"Okay, but not great.","Hello, its me DC. Well, this was a really dissapointing movie and though Gigan was a really cool monster and one of my favorites in the whole series, the movie had too much stock footage. I think the movie was poorly made and probably on a low budget. This isn't a movie I would recommend but it is an okay movie."
2,Stock Footage War!,"Space cockroaches, Gigan, King Ghidorah, Godzilla, Angilas and over 30 minutes of stock footage crap! This movie is so low budget that I don`t know how I give it 2 stars! What this movie is worth is crap but its still cool and worth watching. P.S. The talking of the monsters is bull crap!"
3,SPIFFY MONSTER EXTRAVAGANZA,"This is perhaps one of the best of Toho's original series. Once again aliens are trying to conquer earth using Gigan and King Ghidorah as weapons. This draws Godzilla and Anguirus from Monster Island to protect earth. When the four creatures meet, a great monster battle takes place. Gigan is an impressive creation and the return of Ghidorah makes the movie cooler. This movie has a fairly good plot with few boring parts and little action. The monster scenes are definitely worth watching. It's pretty funny how every time Gigan takes off into the air to attack, he gets hit with the atomic ray. Seeing the monsters talk is weird, but cool. It show s something of Godzilla and Anguirus's attitude towards eachother. Pretty cool. Gigan returns in the next movie: GODZILLA VS MEGALON."
1,I bet even Godzilla thinks Gigan is boring.,"Cockroach-people intend to invade the earth with the help of Gigan but are stopped by Godzilla and that Ankylosaur thing. In both of the films I've seen that contain Gigan, he never comes across as anything more than just 'another monster'. Godzilla and friend talk in silly cartoon voices and Ghidorah (looking very unwell) is thrown in for no better reason than to help the film sell. Moments of good humour early on don't justify this plotless drivel."
5,The Godzilla series list.,"HERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE GODZILLA FILMS FOR YOUNG FANS.....#1 GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS (GOJIRA)#2 GODZILLA RAIDS AGAIN#3 KING KONG VS. GODZILLA#4 MOTHRA VS.

2,Godzilla comes back in a weak adventure,"Well,the film has 2 good things:1) Gigan is a cool monster, and 2)Angilas is used in here for a time,and I like him.Besides that,the movie is pretty bad,from Godzilla talking(no,I am not making this up ),Ghidora looking stiff,and the stock footage."
4,One of the best !!,"This is better that it has plot, compared to Godzilla vs. Megalon. Gigan is a better monster but he was a coward and let Godzilla beat him up."
3,"Good, but could have been better.",This isn't classic Godzilla by any means but it does have it's moments. It's main error is letting Godzilla speak! (why?) The beginning is a bit slow but it picks up to deliver a great ending with lots of destruction and general mayhem.
2,Godzilla speaks (!!) in this mediocre adventure.,"Aliens dispach Gigan (a really cool bird ceature with a buzzsaw on his belly) and King Ghidorah (looking really stiff) to conquer Earth. They knock down alought og building. But naturaly Godzilla isn't very happy about this. He gets with his buddy Angilas, has a bizare syntheiser conversation with Angilas, and then ingages in a bloody battle with Gigan and Ghidrah. Same old stuff"
3,"Stock Footage, Talking Monsters, Exploding Minitures and Four Giant Monster Battling","Although Godzilla and Angilas both talk in two infamous scenes and this movie has the biggest overuse of stock footage since GODZILLA`S REVENGE, I think the final battle between Godzilla and Angilas and Gigan and Ghidora made up for it. I watch this movie alot."
3,better than I remembered,"Not a bad entry into the Godzilla series. Yes much of the city destruction is stock footage, but while you're watching the movie who cares. It does lose a whole star just because hearing Godzilla speak is painful. The plot is recycled alien invasion with an anti pollution moral but the real reason you watch Godzilla vs Gigan is for the fight between monsters and this one is pretty good. Godzilla gets roughed up bad and anguirus is no help at all. King Ghidora is great as usual and Gigan is a tough foe. The bottom line is that it's an entertaining movie that any Godzilla lover will enjoy."
5,"Money, Money, Money","In an effort to crush the resistant and annoying Gauls of Asterix's village, a young Roman comes up with a new plan of attack. In order to make the village come to heel, he decides to show them the benefits of Roman civilisation. Obelix starts selling menhirs to the Romans, and enjoys huge wealth and success. Soon, competition is breeding and jealousies erupt.This story is a great lesson on money, its corrupting influence, and also friendship. Even though there is this serious element to the story, you will also be having a good laugh, too. It is a great story, as per usual with Asterix and friends."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"An economics and trade spoof. A young adviser of Caesar suggests trying an economic tactic to stymie the Gauls, as all the various military methods have been utter failures.This leads to intense and useless competition in Menhir production, and Obelix gaining some financial prestige. No time to hunt boar means no fun, though."
4,fun fun album!!!,... brilliant buy/ the songs are quiet catchy and the album has an easy feel to it .i like this one .
2,Expected more,This tool is supposedly rated to 300ft-lbs but it feels more like 150 even with a little dwell. Pretty disappointed considering dewalts reputation for quality.
4,Liked it so well I bought one for my brother,Works very well for what I use it for. The forward and reverse is tricky but handy when you get used to it.
3,dewalt 1/2 impact socket release,terrible. try getting a socket off. with DRY hands impossible. had to knock it off with wrench.. i took my small grinder and ground down the detent nob. amazing that this could leave the factory this way.of course i am sure this was the ONLY 1/2 dewalt that has this defect ALL the rest are fine!
3,Good tool,"Good tool, quite powerful. I use it a lot when I work on my truck.Well built, rugged and strong.Battery life is great.However it is very noisy (need hearing protection), has no brake, very heavy and is not as powerful as expected.The socket attachement is not practical at all."
5,Great Impact Wrench,"Works great, powered off my lug nuts like a pro, unlike some of the other cordless impact wrenches I first tried... Highly recommended!"
4,DeWalt Fan,"This item was purchased for my husband. Every tool he owns is DeWalt. Before purchasing a cordless impact he looked at several brands. After reading up on different cordless impacts he found the DeWalt DW059K-2 to be the best on the market in his opinion. This product seems to have the most ft lbs of torque then any other cordless model, and that is what he was looking for. Thanks DeWalt!"
4,What I expected and more,"I purchased this CD soley for one track, ""Master Jack"", which I had been searching for over a number of years. I was impressed with the quality of that particular song, but equally impressed with all others on the CD. The sound quality is quite good, and there were songs that I had all but forgotten, thus it is an incredible nostalgia compilation."
3,Excellent song selection but...,"This 2-disc set offers an awesome selection of '60's tunes, some of which you just don't find on other compilations. How often do you see ""Master Jack"" (Four Jacks and a Jill), ""And Suddenly"" (The Cherry People), and ""Apricot Brandy"" (Rhinoceros) on any CD? I had totally forgotten about these songs, mainly because they aren't usually played on oldies stations, and when I heard them again on this CD I was happily reminded of them. Unfortunately, the sound quality is awful, especially considering the year of release. The CD was issued in 1999 and remastering was not uncommon for that time period. The label just got lazy and cheap. I would still highly recommend this compilation for the song selection but deduct two stars for sound."
3,"Great, except you can't use it outside!","I love this little pc. I really do. It's been great in most every way, BUT I think, as another reviewer succinctly stated, that the screen needs to be VISIBLE OUTSIDE. Supposedly, there is an adjustment to accomodate for outside visibility, but as far as I can (barely) see, even with contrast adjusted to the max, outside usage is virtually impossible. In my opinion, this is an unacceptable limitation for a device whose very function is meant to accomodate usage in different environments. Also, sure would be nice if it had a simple ""back"" button. I do appreciate the flexibility and interfacing capabilities with the Word and Excel. This is precisely why I bought the thing. It also seems to me that HP should have included the metal cover that is considered an accessory for the Jornada instead of the cheesy pouch that doesn't actually cover the pc. Guess they may have had these left over from another product and thought they'd stick it in with the Jornada."
5,Very nice,The lavender smells good...IMHO. It is in small beads that help with speeding up the melting process when adding to already melted wax. It comes in a box with six individual one lbs bags. As I wrote...very nice.
4,Therabath Refill Paraffin Wax - Scent Free,"Skin feels soft after use, and there is no odor to compete with other products and perfume."
5,THe Price is Right,"With the free super saver shipping from Amazon, this price is a steal. It seems to be good quality and it retains its aroma for a good long while. I use it on tired hands: instant relief of my clients' aches and soreness!"
5,Perfect,"I purchased this wax to put into a paraffin bath and I must say it is a very good wax. Not strong at all although it has a slight touch of the lavender. I was hesitant at first because of the scent, but I must say it is very mild. Melted very quick in my paraffin bath, and peels very easily when removed. Great product."
2,There is no Lavender scent as advertised,"Simply as title, no lavender scent for this product. Why is the seller mentioned that in the description?"
4,Overall good product,"Overall I like the wax. However, I bought this wax for the lavender scent which is great but I also bought it as it showed to be wax pellets vs a big block of wax. When it arrived they were all ""melted"" together and each bag was just a big lump of wax. Disappointed it wasn't the wax pellets I wanted. I'll be buying a different brand next time."
2,Therabath Lavender Refill Paraffin,"The fragrance of this product is not even remotely anything like lavender. It was difficult to use,as it arrived caked solid, not in pellets as pictured."
4,Pretty much perfect,"When your working, scissors and punch are the main tools you need. Scissors are great, they work just as well as any others. My blade got stuck in the punch, not sure how that happened might've dropped it idk. But nonetheless it works very well. I don't really use the stripper or little LED but i guess it's nice to have. And the holster is fantastic, I like having all my tools right where I know they are. At first it's hard to get the sharpie out or the mag light but it'll loosen up a little. Great stuff"
3,Pleasant but unmoving,"I've been a fan of David Sylvian for years and have found his work very fresh and quite off the beaten path. I stopped listening to him for some time ago and wantedto catch up with where I left off some years ago with this CD.Although I found it pleasing, I was not moved by this body of work. I found it to be rather tiresome. It's as if he had painted himself in a corner and his work had just startedto sound bleak for the sake of being so. In other words this album is in a rut.Something has been lost...Either I've lost the ear for Sylvian's work or he's truly fallen into an artist trap"
4,"Excellent, but underuses Frisell and Ribot","A return to form for Sylvian after the somewhat amelodic ""The First Day."" Guest performers Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell could have been used more. The writing is strong, however, and the album sits just under ""Secrets of the Beehive"" and ""Rain Tree Crow"" as Sylvian's best work. Roughly on par with ""Gone To Earth."" 'Darkest Dreaming' is one of Sylvian's most beautiful songs - performed entirely by himself. A way forward perhaps?"
4,What is this guy talking about?,"Yo, major Sylvian-head. This guy is seriously heavy, but what is he talking about? Out!"
2,This cd lacks the magic of earlier sylvian works,"On the surface this disc might appear to be sylvian's masterpiece. I have read recent reviews that make this claim. Nothing could be further from the truth. Several songs alphabet angel, god man, krishna blue, cafe europa, are just plain duds. The good songs pollen path , dobro #2 and thalhiem can't make up for the blandness that surrounds them. Also, I don't want to hear sylvian imitate tom waits and sade in the same song (Midnight Sun)or miles davis in another (all my mothers's names). Brilliant trees, Gone to Earth and the Rain Tree Crow Disc are all masterworks from an unusually gifted man. Dead Bee's is just plain dull. Maybe he has choosen the wrong guitarists. Could fripp have saved this lackluster event? Maybe it just took too long to make. Better luck next time. But will we have to wait till 2010? A huge D.S. Fan"
1,Not All That I Had Hoped For,"I must admit that I am a bit disappointed. There aren't really any new musical ideas here and some tracks seemed a bit derivative. I also found such a blatantly commercial use of spirituality unappealing...Even though it might have been to a lesser extent that, say, a Madonna, it was a turn-off."
3,Not as good as 'Secrets of the Beehive',"So far, my experience with David Sylvian's music had been 100% satisfying: having heard some of his work with Japan and his outstanding 'Secrets of the Beehive', I figured that this album would be just as good. Well, I was wrong. In spite of some great musical moments (such as the opening ""I Surrender"") this album doesn't get to the level that 'Secrets...' does. It ocasionally departs from that 'mystical' musical path where Sylvian is so good at, to explore other forms, or maybe it is that so far I still cannot get over the change, but I wouldn't recommended for those uninitiated to Sylvian's work."
3,Not his best offering but still worthy of a hearing,"His Krishna Blue and Cafe Europa a much more pop sounding than previous material, but some may find that refreshing. You may do better to go back to his earlier works or try ""Approaching Silence if you want a more ambient sound."
4,"Good, but not as much as I expected","After so many years, we all expected a very good work from David Sylvian. And ""Dead Bees"" is, of course, very good. Elegant music, fluid and mesmeric atmospheres...but I would have liked somethimg more daring and adventurous, as it was the excellent - and underrated - Sylvian's album with Robert Fripp, ""The First Day"". There was a healthy tension in that work, while ""Dead Bees"" seems too languid and evanescent to be truly satisfying and memorable."
2,no weatherbox here...,"I'm afraid i must disagree with those ...[deleted by Amazon.com without poster's permission]... that see much 'gone to earth' or 'secrets of the beehive' influence here. It strikes me as much more bluesy, Rain-Tree-Crow-esque, primarily because guitarist Marc Ribot is no Robert Fripp, or even a David Torn or Phil Palmer. Indeed, Ribot almost spoils the work for me, his horrible little yuppie-jazz flourishes on 'I Surrender' and crude, clichéd soloing on 'Midnight Sun' being the most obvious crimes. This is decent music, and decent Sylvian in Rain Tree Crow mode, but anyone looking for Weatherbox-era music will almost certainly be disappointed."
5,Sylvian fans will not be disappointed.,"Dead Bees On A Cake features 14 new tracks, and blends the deft lyricism of Sylvian's solo work with the sound of Rain Tree Crow. A bit of a blues influence is present as well. The tracks are mostly excellent, though a few of the later songs are a bit too ""deep"" for my tastes. Still - it's a must-have."
5,Leave me alone with this CD...,"I have been a Sylvian fan since forever, but he has exceeded even my very high expectations with this offering. I am only reviewing this now, after I've given it more than a year of listening. It takes time to age on you. I guess not everybody will like this, but if they all would, that would be strange indeed. ""Dead Bees on a Cake"" has become one of my all-time favourites, alongside Brian Eno's ""Ambient 4"" and ""Apollo Atmospheres Soundtrack"", Joy Division's ""Closer"", and just a couple of others. Definitely something to bring along to a desert island, or to listen to on a deathbed. Strong words indeed, but that's what it does to me."
2,"layering: 10, connection: 0","Personally and speaking only for myself, it's all very well made, he knows his little tweaks and fiddles by now, and I'm sure his guest musicians were all on his wavelength. But by gawd, what a crashing bore - there seems to be no sense of emotion here, just lovely little droning ditties to package the new-found emotional centering in. It seems like Sylvian keeps getting more and more interested in making perfect little soundscapes as a means to an end, instead of using the 'scapes as a means for connection to a listener. It is terribly dissapointing from the person who (helped) craft(ed) pieces like Blackwater, Heartbeat, the whole Beehive album, etc. He's turned into the Steely Dan of the Eno set."
4,just discovered Sylvian,"What a voice! ""Dead Bees on a Cake"" is my first David Sylvian experience and I am excited, intrigued and often smiling as I listen. It feels like walking out late at night, under a full moon, observing the sights and sounds - only put to music. I'm still getting to know these songs and feeling so pleased to have found out about him. Experienced Sylvian listeners out there, pls email me about what of his I should explore next!"
2,Bland,Dull music from one of my favorites. It doesn't contain any memorable songs; they just seep and ooze one into another. I've played this three times and have given up. Very uninspired. Too bad.
3,"Fine album, even if something is missing","Dead bees on a cake is not probably a masterpiece of Sylvian's production like Secrets of the Beehive or like Gone to earth even if I've appreciated very much I surrender and expecially Darkest Dreaming, one of the best pieces of contemporary music and something really delightful and inspired. But in the core of this album what lacks is the presence of a unique music design."
3,An uneven project,"There are a few splendid songs on this disc. Among them are I Surrender, Thalhiem, Cafe Europa and Dobro #1. The bad thing is that there are too many weak moments in between, and two awful tracks, number 10 and 11. Secrets of the Beehive must surely remain his masterpiece, forever."
3,"Fine album, but previous ones are better","I'm a Sylvian fan for a long time already. I think the first few solo albums are still the best. The atmosphere on these is great and exciting and not at all boring. This new album is OK (exept for track 10 and 11 !!), but it's not that new or exciting. It's Sylvian in automatic gear and suffering from real inspiration. Perhaps he should start to call his old Japan pals and start playing together again."
5,maybe better than the previous ones,"though my fav.song of Sylvian is ""forbidden colours"" in Secrets of the beehive & ""nostalgia"" in brillant tree,overall this latest album is of even better quality than both of them. i'm so glad."
2,After more than ten years is this all he can come up with?,"I was very disappointed with David's new release. After his last album, which is my favourite album of all time, I have been finding it very difficult listening these last few weeks since release. After hearing I Surrender, I was very excited at the prospect of hearing more as soon as possible. But now that I've had the opportunity to live with the album now for several weeks, I'm still not finding it very accessable. I hope to persist."
1,wrong edition - American insted of British,"I received an American edition of the Wilde DVD - which is incompatible with our Danish DVD machines. Usually, when I order from Amazon.uk I get the British edition which causes no problem - I don't know what happened this time?Anne SchytteGrammar school teacher"
3,"Factual, Lackluster, Though With An Enjoyably Bad Poem About Cremation Nicely Sneaked In","Factual and lackluster about sums up this Oscar Wilde biopic. The story of Wilde's superstar life during the height of his fame in 1890's London and his tragic, albeit self-authored fall from celebrity (largely as a result of poorly-placed trust in others) would seemingly provide a great story on a silver platter (hmm, a Salome reference, mebbe?) but the makers of this movie managed to squander the material and turn out an uninspiring, forgettable yawner. There was little deviation from acknowledged facts regarding Wilde's private life, and that is in the film's favor, but how a story of betrayal, forbidden love, celebrity, blackmail, and the OJ trial of its day came out as a slow-moving piece of forgotten 1990's cinema is baffling."
3,OSCAR DESERVED BETTER,"WILDE(1997) is a superficial account on Oscar Wilde`s life. Stephen Fry lacks his cynisisem, but JUDE LAW excells as Bosie."
4,Wild About Wilde,"Before I saw this movie I really had no idea just how awesome Oscar Wilde was. I knew he was a homosexual, and I knew he was a writer. When I saw the movie the first time I was somewhat shocked by the love scenes; I didn't expect them to emerge quite so quickly or to continue so far into the film. But upon seeing the movie again, I was able to focus more on the deeper themes of the story. As other reviewers have said, the film is perfectly cast: Fry as Wilde, Law as Bosie, Ehle as Constance. I found the Victorian politics very interesting, and the movie was quite educational. The only thing I really didn't like was the fact that they focused more on Wilde's love/sex life than his life as a writer. Overall, though, it was enjoyable, and I am now a huge fan of Oscar. I kissed his tombstone in Paris!""It is the spectator, and not life, which art really mirrors."""
5,Boise vs. Robert Ross,"I am a long-time student of Oscar Wilde, and thought this movie did an excellent job of portraying Oscar's story and characterization. By far the most wondrous thing in it, though, was the tension between Robbie Ross and Lord Alfred. I thought this was SO true to life!!!"
5,Treasured and hard to find this item almost anywhere,"I have, without success, been looking for this note while movie for a number of years to no avail.The acting is awesome along with that the movie is based on historical facts.First rate service, thank you and at reasonable price."
4,A Reliable Version,"Brian Gilbert's ""Wilde"" stands as a realiable version of the Irish writer's later years. Wilde's relationship with Alfred Douglas, Robert Ross, his wife Constance and many other characters is consistent, and agrees with reports left by contemporaries who knew well Oscar Wilde and his circle. Good performances by Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Michael Sheen and Tom Wilkinson. The latter, as the marquis of Queensberry, is outstanding - although portraying such a clichéed character is obviously a much easier task than, say, the ambiguity of Wilde himself or the never too well explained behaviour of Constance Wilde. Art direction is superb and manages to take us into the very rooms where action takes place in a most natural manner. Vanessa Redgrave makes a short apparition, though she fails to capture Wilde's mother eccentricities properly, as well as the influence she had on her son's life."
4,wilde,"Wilde coming to terms with his new found sexual identity. Of his homosexuality, forced him to juggled his marriage,fatherhood,obsessive love,responsibility with lord Alfred Douglas."
4,Flakey,A good tasting biscuit but pretty messy to eat. Has a nice lemon flavor and serves as a good light snack.
1,Not at all what I thought,"So Amazon suggested this as an alternative to Crawford Garibaldi biscuits. Being how I am in search of a suitable replacement for the old Sunshine raisin biscuits, I figured I'd give 'em a try. What a mistake. Not only they are nothing like the Sunshines, they are nothing like the Garibaldis either. The pictures on the package are quite misleading, suggesting that there is actual fruit to be found inside the biscuits. Not so. Yeah, there's a couple of raisin specks in each biscuit, but if you didn't already know that you'd be hard-pressed to figure out what kind of fruit it was supposed to represent. On the upside? Well, the dog likes them. So I won't bother to return them as she is a good dog and deserving of things that she thinks are a treat. You probably won't find them very treat-like unless you long for dried out wafers with vaguely representational fruit-specks in them. Get the Garibaldis instead.Crawfords Garibaldi Biscuits 100g (case of 12)"
2,Not as good as the Sunshine/Sunbeam ones,I am disapointed in these. I thought they would be more like the Sunbeam/Sunshine Brand my Grandma used to buy but they don't compare at all.
4,Very well researched,"Just a note on the review by the person who said 2 Timothy 3:14 would defeat this whole book. Ignore his comments, it is obvious that he didn't read the book. There is a whole, very in depth chapter on that verse and why it does not mean ""sola scriptura.""Otherwise, if you are interested in the early history of the Bible, and the Christian faith, and why sola scriptura should be regarded as a ""new gospel,"" there is well documented information for you here."
1,Look no further,"You need look no further than 2 Timothy 3:14 to refute the entire premise of the book: ""the holy Scriptures, are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.""This seems to have escaped the authors, who like to give credit for this truth to Protestants, thanks, but it's God's Word not an organized religion's theory---perhaps there's no desire to engage in that losing battle, attacking God's Word rather than a group of mere humans.It's irresponsible to not address that basic issue, but then, the book would end after one sentence--wouldn't it?? Instead I recommend the Gospel According to Rome by McCarthy much more balanced, rather than human opinion, he merely quotes God..."
1,Lots of words BUT NO UNDERSTANDING,"Sungensis (""Bible Bob""- his designation)is a great example of two things: 1. How to go through Seminary and just memorize a bunch of facts without understanding what you were supposed to learn (like Scott Hahn, Martin Grodi, etc.). 2. How to build a false picture of your opponents argument, refute it and then claim victory over some thing that your opponent doesn't believe. To anyone who wants to read a lot of words about some fictious belief of the Protestants then waste your time and read Bible Bob's book. If anything, it will be a great door stop. I don't recommend this mistreatment of Sola Scriptura to anyone. It is a joke."
1,The RCC embraces false tradition that contradicts scripture,"Here is where the entire book falls flat..BOTH Catholic and Protestant Bibles contain a common set ofbooks between them, that they BOTH consider the inspired,infallible Word of the Living God.Any tradition that goes against what is said in that commonset of books is a FALSE tradition.Only one example is needed to demonstrate my point:The RCC claims Mary was sinless, when in fact there is overwealming scriptural evidence against such a claim as ALLare stained with original sin and no one can be justified byMosiac Law.This is why the RCC had to invent ""Immaculate Conception"" toclaim that Mary was created in the womb by God, just like Hehad done with Jesus.That's a rather large ommission, and goes against EVERYTHINGtaught in the scriptures BOTH Catholics and Protestantshold dear.Scriptures trump Tradition.End of story... this half page of commentary refutes all 600+ pages of this paper pompus weight..."
2,The Roman Catholic PR engine is hard at work here...,"Not one arguemnt in this book demonstrates a valid refutation of the authority of Scripture. Also, if everthing is validated against the canon of Scripture, what are you adding by calling Patristics and Pope's equal to Jesus? Bizarre and controlling stuff man, bizarre. After reading the online reviews I expected to have my faith challenged as a converted Catholic. I became a Christian after being Roman Catholic for over 32 years. Roman Catholocism is still an ""ism"" and really shows that in this counter reformation publication. How is it that the Word's of our Lord are not enough for these people? Clearly Christian and Roman Catholic are two very different things..."
2,debate settled,"Dear Friends, Just show us that the Pope is perfect..... If that can be done there is no reason for anymore lengthy books!"
2,Quality not as expected,I was expecting the paper and the quality of the print to be better than it was. It was more of a cheap reproduction.
4,good job explaining mafia's role in society,"I think this book does one thing very well - explain just how penetrating an influence the mafia have in so many aspects of Japanese society. In New York you would have to go looking for mafiosos in their lairs but walk into any decent hotel in Osaka or Kobe and you'll find 2 in the lobby; their business tentacles are in everything, not just sanitation & construction. While the fed government here has worked zealously (probably too zealously) to reduce the Italian mob to a few unglamorous rackets, it seems like every major real estate deal in jpn as some concealed mafia presence; even the gov't employs them for various unseemly tasks. I think whiting does a lot to unravel part of this mystery -- at least why the yakuza, who had been around for some time, flourished and became so visible. It's gross that the US helped."
3,Interesting subject presented in a booooring manner.,"This writer's style is BORING. It's as well written as one of those ""encyclopedia of serial killers"" books you always see for a buck in the bargain bin, but minus the typos those books usually contain. It's almost to boring to be a bathroom book... ALMOST. At least the subject is interesting. Tokyo Vice is a much better book, despite the author trying to convince you how cool he is every page. Get Tokyo Vice instead."
5,insightful and fascinating,"The author draws convincing connections between the US occupation and the corruption in the Japanese business/political world. Some of the things that the author discusses are crucial to a full understanding of modern Japanese history, but you will not find them in ""official"" American or Japanese sources. Examples: US occupation rationing system giving yakuza their black market niche in all goods; Americans getting wealthy by illegal means during the occupation; and much info on minority-status Koreans in Japan and their relations with both North and South Korea. This is an excellent book."
4,Fascinating,"The Hutterites are a small group of Christians practicing a communal life style. This DVD is an introduction to their way of life and as such is a rare treat. The DVD is a bit dated, but offers a fascinating introduction to the religious group."
1,Do not waste your money,I first watch American colony : meet the Hutterites it was good but this was not. You can get more out American colony : meet the Hutterites on Amazon Instant Video.
4,A Grateful Recipient,"I see that the reissue date of the CD is 1993, however, I know that I've attempted to obtain this album many times within the last few years. I did communicate with many fans both in the USA and in Europe and could only find used copies of the LP. The acoustic side is my favorite. The liner notes provide great insight and every song is a classic. However, in spite of the remastering, there is distortion from the bass on The Enchanted Gypsy. That's why I gave it four stars. I'm still forever grateful. Thank You !"
3,Old memories,"I remembered this album differently. I guess it was the times. I still find it relaxing to listen to, which is why I bought it. I used to have the boxed record set."
4,SEEK OUT THE COLLECTORS CHOICE ISSUE,There are plenty of reviews detailing the fabulous tunes found upon this disc. No home is complete without it. BGO issued a mono version of this CD and followed it with a slightly better sounding stereo version. Collectors Choice has since released a superior (stereo) disc. It sounds like someone finally located the master tapes. Pick up a copy. Your ears will thank you.
5,A Poetry Feast,"Nobody writes lyrics like Donovan. Whether it's a complex, brooding ballad or a simple little ditty, his extraordinary and very original imagination comes bursting forth like (you guessed it) a flower in a garden. Listening to this CD after not having heard the album for about 2 decades was a very satisfying experience. Whether he's performing with a diverse group of musicians or just singing with a solo guitar, Donovan emerges as a strong performer who stands up very well to the test of time."
1,Gift From a Flower to a Garden,"I first started listening to the second half (FOR LITTLE ONES)in the late sixties and haven't heard it 25 yrs.I am nuts about this section of this double album.Donovan is so descriptive that I can see what he writes of. They conjure up images and make me think. I've never gotten tired of these songs. they are truly timeless. The words are excellently chosen. I am familiar with the first song of the first section of this double album (WEAR YOUR LOVE LIKE HEAVEN) i like it because of the colours he paints and the nice thoughts he evokes. I have not listened to the rest of the first section much cause i can't get enough of the 2nd section. I'm gonna buy one for my bro' who turned me on to FOR LITTLE ONES in '68. I wore out two albums. Sincerely, Lou."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR . THIS IS A RIP OFF.,"This was advertised as a double album. The case states it is a double album. IT IS NOT. There was only a single CD Disc 1. The 'liner notes' are abysmal. It is virtually impossible to read them even with a magnifying glass. A REALLY CHEAP, SHODDY, AND DECEPTIVELY ADVERTISED PRODUCT."
4,"I have been looking for ""For Little Ones"" for years","I am not generally a huge Donovan fan. But, my mom has this scratchy album called ""For Little Ones"", which is the second album of this set, that has always been ambrosia for me. These are some of the best lullabies and folk sonnets I have ever heard. Donovan has a gift for creating such lovely images with perfection of phrase. That scratchy old record has been dubbed to tape a thousand times, and the tape gets listened to until you can only hear tape hiss. It will be a real treat to hear them in CD quality. And a treasure that I just can't wait to share with my mom. Now that's Magic!"
5,Donovan Does It Again,"One of the first pop two-disc box sets is now on one CD. The title refers to Donovan as the ""prince of flower power"", the ""Garden"" being his fans. A must for both young and old. Donovan wrote the liner notes (the first half of the disc's lyrics are very small, being copied from the LP sleeve. The ""Songs For Little Ones"" half begins with the wailing of Donovan's son (probably Donovan Leitch Jr. who was born around the time). Like many of his tunes they are simple and childlike. He even pays tribute to his mentor Derroll Adams in the last song ""Epistle to Derroll"".It should be noticed there are many references to sea and aquatic life (a recurring Donovan theme) so this is the perfect album for a summer's day!"
5,Beautiful Songs,"I got the single album of the first 10 songs around 1967-68. The songs are simple and pure and relaxing. Many of them stuck with me for all these years. Since my record player is long gone (but not the best albums), I decided to get this cd. I had never heard the last 10 songs, save for those that made it to greatest hits compilations. I agree with other reviewers that these are exceptional, bringing the listener to a long forgotton sea shore on the British Isles. I highly recommend the Hurdy Gurdy Man cd - my favorite Donovan song is the last - ""Teas""."
5,Gift from a flower to a garden,Anyone who came of age in the late nineteen sixties would remember and love this album. Great tunes and lyrics. Donovan is a poet.
2,A Rip from the Big Yin,"Save your bucks, buckos...these same bits are on other CD's of his...funny once the ear gets the flow of the accents, but who needs two copies of the same bits...nay me"
5,I love this system!,"I discovered (and bought) Jane's first two Caught'ya books at the national Differentiated Education conference last summer. I have used the high school level stories successfully in the two semesters since then. I wanted more stories so that I could keep my students on track throughout the year, so I ordered The Chortling Bard.What a resource! There are three fully-completed stories based on some of Shakespeare's most entertaining plays. Not only do my students get practice adn instruction in grammar, but they get exposure to Shakespeare without slogging through it all at once. They can experience the stories and enjoy the plots, since they're not doing the incomprehensible everybody-read-a-part-even-if-you-don't-know-what-you're-saying thing. They may not read the original Shakespeare, but they are involved in the story, which generates discussions, and by the end, they get it!"
3,Chortling Bard,"This product requires a pretty thorough knowledge of English grammar to use it. You also have to re-write the text w/ errors for the students to correct each day. It is a great concept, probably better for a public school setting than a home school setting where I was looking for something interesting and different but more ""spoon fed"" for grammar this year."
5,NICE ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION,"If you like Earl you will like this, the guitar is great so are the vocals. I have had this for a few years, but just started listening to it. I now know what I was missing. This came out in 1970 but is still a quality recording, his guitar playing is excellent also. The only drawback is it is to short but it is still worth buying since his output is so small. I will try to get some more of his stuff while I still can."
3,Their best --which is not saying very much,"5 stars-Come on! This band is ok on some songs when they mix the Cheap Trick meets Yes sensibility. But, they go way too far mixing bizarre styles. Led by the overly pompous Neil Morse, this band wears thin after awhile. There hasn't been anyone so pompous in music since Pedroza of the Hoax."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable musicianship and music!,"These guys are going full steam ahead. This latest effort doesn't disappoint one bit compared to their earlier material. While almost every track has a really catchy melody and/or hook, this is progressive rock at it's finest. The group delivers a broad array of music and is reminiscent of prog groups of the past, but no matter what's going on they're always Spock's Beard."
5,Incredible talent shows on this release,"I won't be redundant based on all these reviews of the CD. Besides wanting to say I absolutely love this band, as humans, they are not perfect. I was going to take away 1 star mainly for track #3 which I feel was not a well written song. However, when you compare this SB album to what else is available, it sounds too close to perfect. This album has some really great tracks where they nailed almost every aspect of music (instrumentation, song writing, style, performance). Tracks #1, #6, and #7 will remain on my must-play list and contain mixtures of Yes-like complexity, ELP-like performance, Simon & Garfunkel-like beauty, and Spock's Beard unique style and song writing. Go ahead - if you like prog rock - buy it."
5,Buy this CD!!!! Progrock at its best!!!,"Spock's Beard is a hybrid of Genesis, Yes and Gentle Giant with a dash of Beatle-esque pop thrown in for good measure. Through all of that they forge their own distinct style. ""Kindness Of Strangers"" is their defining moment."
4,"Spock's Beard - June, Came Upon Us Much Too Soon.........","On this tour the band's T-shirts read ""The Beard Is Out There..."" indeed this was an appropriate statement. ""Kindness"" as an album is all over the place. I probably do not like it as much as the band's previous two, but it is another prime source of melodic modern progressive rock. The album contains one of the band's most loved tunes the rather straightforward ballad ""June"" with it's 3 part vocal harmonies. Other great tunes include ""The Good Don't Last"", ""In The Mouth Of Madness"" and ""Harms Way"". On the more average side the album seems to be a stab at going in a more commercial direction in spots and I don't really think the big epic ""Flow"" that closes the album is in the same league as the ones from the previous two. I rank ""Kindness"" slightly lower than the band's first two discs, but I still pretty much enjoy the whole thing."
1,Basket handle broke first day. Toto appears rabid.,Flimsy basket came apart and the handle came off the first day of play. My daughter asked why Toto looks scary. The stuffed toy dogs muzzle expression looks sort of frightening. Total waste of money.
1,Toto isn't suppose to be scary!,This was a waste of money. When I received it and took toto out of the basket he was Scary looking! My daughter would have been petrified of him. They made him showing sharp teeth. He didn't look anything like toto at all.
3,It was okay,"I want to give my honest opinion of this book. I have never read anything else by this author. While it was entertaining, I found it to get just a little more drawn out than I would have liked. I also did not like his viewpoints on some of the different plants. I guess you just need to take it in stride, but when he characterizes some of your favorite plants as nuisances (or more), etc. it is a little irritating. I did enjoy it, but I don't think I'll read him again. I wanted to give this review, since everyone seems to have LOVED this book but me."
4,A book that stays with you,"I first read Merry Hall over 30 years ago, and having recently re-read it I was impressed by how much an impression it had made on me. Many a time I have unknowingly quoted from the work, thinking the quote apocryphal!You must read for yourself how to deal with an overgrown holly hedge, and how to plant hundreds of trees without buying them, and what berberis can do for you, and why you should cultivate periwinkle...I'm sure you'll be delighted with the finely drawn sketches of the real people populating the story: the characters of gardeners, society ladies, and men who work for the government in a clearly covert and somewhat sinister capacity. You'll enjoy the cats, the lilies, and how to create an English country garden from a neglected and ill directed site.The gentle humor reflects the gentler times before the horrors of World War 2 brought violence, destruction, and death into the hearts and homes of most of Britain.This book is a keeper!"
4,good presentation,"This book came in a timely manner, got it just like a day after it said it would be arriving. It contains some highlighted pages, but that was expected since I knew it was used. Everything else is fine with the book."
1,Hard to understand,"I have no idea what this book is trying to say...it's so cluttered that I can't seem to follow it. It's boring, to say the least, and I don't really give care because you could just go to Wikipedia and get a much clearer interpretation of the case/contract."
3,Don't buy the updated 7th editon,"I have the 6th edition. When the semester started I found I was not on track with the class which was using the 7th, SO, I spent big bucks for the 7th ed.Turns out it was thrown out money. Check the table of contents, there are very few new cases. In the beginning of the book some cases are just in a different order.In the first 200 pages, I had found 6 typos in the 6th ed. FIVE are not corrected in the 7th.$75-150 for the 7th ed.$3 up for a used 6th ed.......It's a no brainer, save your money. Spend $5 photcopying the missing cases in the library, or find them free on line.Sometimes, a new edition has important changes. This edition seems to be an attempt to kill the market in used textbooks for this course."
1,Terrible Contracts Book,"This book is organized in the worst possible manner. It's really absurd. If we didn't rely on this book so much in class, I would just buy Murray and ignore this book. It's pretty useless."
4,What a textbook!,"I love this book! It arrived in a quick time, and the highlighting is not too much. I'm glad I chose to purchase from this vendor. Keep up the good work!"
5,Alan Jackson Precious Memories Live DVD,"This was a perfect gift for our four-year-old daughter! She loves to sing along with Alan as he performs what he refers to as ""some of the old Hymns that I was raised on"". A wonderful DVD for the entire family!"
2,Tiresome prig,"This biography is one of the ""classics"" of English literature. Unfortunately, I found the subject, Samuel Johnson, a thoroughly unlikeable, arrogant prig. Despite Boswell's best efforts at hero worship, I could not get past Johnson's self-righteousness."
3,"Detailed, if sugar-coated, account of key war","In style and detail, this book is a good read. Its views are somewhat outdated now and Kurzman's suppression of the more unsavory side of the anti-civilian violence from the Zionist/ Israeli side now seems quaint. (Example: he refers in one place to a killing of Jewish workers as raising Arab fighting morale in Haifa, ignoring the fact that this had no effect on morale as it resulted from a worker riot following a random terror bombing of Arab workers by Jewish extermists and was followed by an unmentioned murderous retaliatory night raid by Jewish militia into a peaceful village.) Modern Israeli press accounts reveal that Kurzman deliberately downplayed the massacres of Arab civilians he discovered in his researches in the Israeli archives. This is ""home team"" coverage and ot an unbiased account. But for useful information and good storytelling, it passes muster. Just don't take it as the final word."
3,Very expensive for something that won't turn,"Our 11 month old daughter was really into walking when we bought this for her. She was constantly wanting to hold our hands so she could practice walking, so we bought her this walker so she could learn to stand a little straighter (she leans forward a lot when holding on to our hands). It worked great! I think the racheted wheels make all the difference in the world.She was a pro (relatively speaking) at walking within two weeks...after which she rarely used the walker...because she couldn't get it to turn. I gave this product a lower rating because it was very pricey, does not turn and was only really used for a couple of weeks."
5,Great wagon/walker!,"We bought this wagon for our 8 month old daughter who was just showing interest in pulling her self up and walking with assistance. She loves racing across the living room with the wagon. Now at 10 months, she is enjoying putting things in the wagon and taking them out. Her 12 month old cousin was visiting and she spent most of her time stepping in and out of the wagon (with the sides removed it creates a platform) and standing inside. There are so many ways to play with this wagon that children can discover as they grow. I can imagine her pushing her dolls or other toys around in it when she is a toddler or preschool aged. She also enjoys wagon rides from an adult. This wagon will far outlast any plastic walker/push toy that your child will outgrow once they are a sturdy walker. It is made of high quality materials and is very sturdy and does not tip over."
4,Great fun when one of the back wheels doesn't fall off,"This is one of Sadie's favorite toys. She is content to push it through the house and bang into walls and furniture all afternoon long. She also likes to put toys, stuffed animals, and other random things from around the house in the wagon and push them all over the house. Occaisionally a cat gets run over, but otherwise its pretty safe. The only problem is that usually after she has been playing for awhile, one of the back wheels keeps falling off. Its easily put back on, but it is annoying since she is still tries to push it during the repair."
5,Fun and Safe!,Wheel tension lets a young walker push the wagon instead of falling while trying to keep up with it. Fantastic feature! She had problems keeping up with other walker toys. I got it for my niece and it was an instant hit with her as well as her parents!
5,SO CUTE & STURDY! A GREAT TOY FOR OUR LIL' FRIEND!!! :0),"Everything arrived nicely packaged and was easy to assemble- and sturdy after being put together. Our son is 10 months and not crawling quite yet, but will be very soon as well as walking with his strong little legs. He's a big healthy boy- about the size of an 18 month old and really likes holding on to this walker as well as riding in it- fits in it just right. We mix it up a bit as he is learning to walk. We want to make it fun and he really likes this toy. Also, it doesn't tip over- YAY!!! We definitely didn't want a walker that would tip over. We are pleased with our purchase, glad we spent a little more to get the right walker/toy for our lil' buddy. He will use this for a long time and once he's walking around, he'll most likely travel around our home with his toys and out to the garden with little plants and gardening tools. THANKS SO MUCH!!! SHALOM <3"
5,Todler Obsession,"My 9.5 month old baby loves this more than anything he has played with yet. He will walk with the wagon as long as I keep turning him around when he hits the walls.. When he first got up to use it he squeeled!!! This wagon is stable, has a speed retarder, and is perfect for babies who are just starting to walk!!! We love it."
5,Best Investment!,"My son got this as a gift for his 1 year birthday and we literally had to tear him away from it at the end of the day. It has been his favorite toy for months now. At first he just loved to push it everywhere. Now that he's 16 months he can now turn it and load it with ""goods"". Very high quality and worth every penny."
3,Too heavy,"First of all this walker wagon is really well made. It is really heavy and super cute. I have no issues with the quality at all. But that's exactly the problem with it too! It's too heavy!! It is almost impossible to turn, so my son would walk straight and require help all the time turning corners. He loves being ""raced"" around in this, but that's not what i bought it for! I would go with a different, lighter, walker next time. This does not help with learning to walk at all."
5,Best Walker EVER!,"I think this is an awesome walker. My son just received it for his first birthday and it's become his favorite toy. He will push it from one side of the room to the other. The only down point I could see is that it doesn't have a lot of resistance while pushing. However, my son does just fine with it."
4,Great toddler toy!,"Bought this for my son's first birthday. He used it as a walker, as he was still quite wobbly on his feet. He loves it! He loves to sit in it and be pushed around, and sometimes he will walk around with it. When he gets too old for it, it will become toy storage.One thing I don't like--the side rails do not stay in--my son removes them all the time, then gets very frustrated when he can't get them back in the slots."
5,Perfect First Birthday Gift,"This is the second Radio Flyer Classic Walker Wagon I have purchased for grandchildren. It is great because it is not large so can be used even in smaller spaces. It encourages leg muscle development and is a confidence builder for independent walking. I do not care for traditional walkers. They seem clumsy and not safe. Also, the parents can pull the child in the wagon and the child can fill the wagon with toys. Then the child can pull the wagon when walking is mastered. Just a wonderful toy! Keep it for the second child."
5,RADIO FLYER WALKER WAGON,THIS IS A GREAT WAGON FOR WEE ONES- IT DOESN'T DUMP THEM IF THEY ARE TRYING TO STAND UP AND HOLDING ONTO IT. I ORDERED IT FOR MY GRANDSONS FIRST BIRTHDAY AND HE IS NOW THREE AND CONTINUES TO PLAY WITH IT- HE LEARNED TO WALK BY PUSHING EVERYWHERE HE WANTED TO GO- IT IS HEAVIER THAN MOST SO IT IS HARDER FOR A TODDLER TO MANUEVER AROUND CORNERS BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A GREAT FIRST WAGON
5,A Classic,"We have purchased one of these wagons for the first Christmas of each of our four grandchildren. It is a classic. Easy to assemble and lasts forever. It actually has mechanism that slows the wagon down so it will not ""run away"" when the child is pushing it. I highly recommend this product. Amazon had the best price on the item by far."
5,great help for the new walker,"We bought this for our son who was almost walking, but still cautious. I knew it would be a matter of minutes before he took off, but lacked the confidence. Once we got this wagon, he was so happy and walking back and forth in our apartment. It was sturdy enough that it didn't just lead him, but he was able to control the speed. After a couple days, he was more confident in his legs and was off walking on his own.We bought a second wagon for his cousin who is four months younger than him."
1,not the best choice,"Not the best choice. I've used three baby walkers with six kids (mine and my sister's). My favorites - the Galt Baby Walker - well balanced, easy for the child to stand up and push - manuvers well. I've also used and love, the new Plan Toy Baby Walker - beautiful piece, all wood - easy to manuver - well balanced and easy for the child to use. We found the Radio Flyer Walker too heavy for a new walking toddler and impossible for the child to turn. Also not thrilled with the quality of the Radio Flyer Baby Walker now that it's made in China - the wood finish is a bit rough on little hands."
1,Questionnable materials,"It is a beautiful wagon. BUT. Upon opening the box, the odor of paint and/or plastic was overwhelming. After assembly we decided to let it air out / off-gas for a few days, thinking it might have just been the new-from-the-factory smell. After five days it still emitted the same odor. We even posted a question on the radio flyer web site asking what materials, including paint type, were used. No response after a week. So we returned it and purchased another wooden walker, and there was no odor upon opening the box. The radio flyer is truly a good looking toy, and seems durable, however we did not feel comfortable having an infant play and live with it in the nursery."
4,Perfect walker for our daughter,"We bought this little wagon for our daughter as a walker. We hated the cheap Fisher Price one our son used as it was just flimsy plastic with no traction or speed control. This wagon is awesome. Can't say enough about it. Now that my daughter is 2 she and her brother take the side rails off and push each other around the house. When they are done, it's a cute wagon to hold all of her dolls. She uses it as their stroller too. Worth every penny!"
3,Good quality product,There are obvious educational value to this product... no comments. Babies can start to learn walking: the wheels prevent the radio flyer to move too fast. Simple and well done.The quality is very good. Wood and metal only and so little plastic. I bet this thing will last for few generations ;-)
5,Lit'l Red Wagon,"I purchase this gift for friends babies turning one, its durable, when the child is first walking it helps with their balance, they love pushing their toys in it and they love being pushed in it."
4,great help for emerging walkers!,"This toy has been a great help for my baby who is just learning to walk. I love that the wheels don't make noise on the hard floors, and that it doesn't get away from him. My four and five year old love to push each other around in it as well. My only complaint is that it doesn't turn."
4,Great as a walker but....,"This is great as a walker and doesn't flip over - it does help them learn to walk. However, that being said, this wagon isn't that great after that - it only goes really one way and the wheels don't turn so they can't really steer. If you're looking for a wagon for your child that can walk - look elsewhere for one that has steering capabilities - this is NOT it.I would recommend for all children as a walker wagon only."
5,Perfect for beginning walkers,"This really is perfect for a babe learning how to toddle. It doesn't go too fast, and our little one is so delighted with it. Highly recommended."
5,Excelllent For Little Walkers,My 13 month old son LOVES this. This is helping him learn to walk and build strength. The removable sides are also a nice bonus. Without the wooden sides he is able to climb in and out inside the house and load it easily with toys. I would recommend this to anyone with small children.
5,Mama's Dream Walker,This is absolutely the best walking toy ever made! This is a sturdy wagon for unsteady feet. My daughter also love to ride in it. This will be a great toy for years to come! I would strongly recommend this wagon for any parent wanting to build their child's confidence to walk.
4,Great first walking toy,I bought this wagon for my 9 month old granddaughter. My daughter commented it was very easy to put together. My granddaughter took to it right away! It is great on hard wood floors as it has a slowing feature so it doesnt fly out from under her. She walks all over the house with it. We like that you can take the sides and back off. When we took the back off it was easy for her to climb in and out of it. And of course she loves to have her parents give her rides in it. A great toy!
3,Grandma in NY,"This Radio Flyer Wagon is adorable. It appears to be indestructible. However, three men could not figure out how to put it together. When they gave up, my daughter put it together herself in less than half an hour. The only drawback is it, obviously, cannot be steered. Much to my disappointment, my grandson goes for a much less expensive pleastic walker toy that he can move all around with. If the front wheels were redesigned to swivel, the wagon would be perfect. As is, the Radio Flyer is too expensive as a place for storing toys."
5,Great toy investment,"My son played with this before he could walk, I'd take the sides off and he'd load stuff in and out, in and out.It was his favorite push toy while he was learning to walk. Lucky for us, we have a good straight-of-way, but even when he did run into things, no damage done. It's sturdy, but also not real distructive.Now he's up and running and he LOVES to load this wagon up and make the dining room/kitchen/living room/dining room loop. He's figured out how to lift or slide the back wheels (intuitively) and goes around and around, full speed ahead. Sometimes he'll climb in and read a book without any interaction from us. We also used it when we got portraits made and it was an adorable prop.The only problem we have had was that one screw came loose on one of the wooden removable rails. A little screw glue and it's back to heavy duty toddler abuse."
5,Wonderful wagon!,"My 10 month old son loves to walk with this wagon. Best thing about it is, it does not tip when he pulls himself up on it no matter what side he chooses to do so on. Well crafted and an absolute HIT in my house. Well worth the money, best walker out there."
3,well made but....,"this is a well-made product...authentic material, etc. I bought for my 2 yr old because he likes to push things around. The only problem is that he likes to climb inside of it by himself...because the wheels slides rather easily, I think it's a bit dangerous for him to be climbing in/out of at that age. However, I must say that he really loves it."
4,We use it has part of our infant's Montessori education.,"Maria Montessori, the great educator, recommended such a walker wagon for children learning to walk. It gives them something to hold on to that can move with them but does not hamper their movement. While we would have preferred an all-wood model, this was the closest thing we could find, so we purchased it for our baby.Our daughter doesn't use it to walk quite yet, but she still loves climbing in and out of it. She also enjoys when we give her rides in it. She's almost ready to push it around, and I'm sure that she will enjoy it greatly.It was fairly easy to assemble and is the right size for a child learning to walk. It even has a nice rubber piece that adds resistance while rolling so that it doesn't roll to fast for the child.There are two downsides, I think. First, it's a little bit expensive. Secondly, it is very hard to turn. So don't expect your child to push it around in a circle; it's forward and reverse only."
3,"Cute, but poor quality and screws stick out","We bought this for a 9-month old starting to walk.This toy was difficult to assemble. The parts and pieces are not well built and of poor quality. Screw holes were off, and screw ends stick out presenting a hazard to a small child. This is not the quality we would like. We plan on getting silicone and putting it on the screw ends to make it safer.Updating to 3 stars only because our daughter loves it so much."
3,"Great classic look, mediocre build quality","I just assembled this last night, and I was not impressed with the fit of the pieces. The whole thing is pretty shaky even after plenty of tightening. Also, there are a lot of washers and nuts that seem like they could wiggle loose over time. The instructions also don't seem to correspond to some of the pieces that came in the box.That being said, I love the look of it and my 10-month old daughter looked adorable pushing it down the hallway. I will update this later with some long-term observations."
2,Great- Except for the Missing Part,"Hello Amazon,This little wagon is great. Our 8 month old daughter loves it and now that she's learning to walk she can push it and stagger along with it. She also enjoys putting and taking things out of the wagon. All in all a great product. One thing though, we didn't get the correct part for the handlebar. Theres's a metal dowel with a threaded end that we didn't receive. We have the handlebar it runs through, but no dowel. So, it falls out from the slightest yanking of a little baby. We would appreciate it if that part could be sent to us, since I'd rather not return a wagon that I've already put together."
1,lousy quality product,So disappointed when I got this. None of the pieces fit flush against each other. Directions to assemble were confusing and pieces were weak and crumbled. Product was made in China. The plastic wheel caps broke on day 1 already! cheap and terrible. I can't believe the quality has fallen this far. Can't believe Amazon is carrying this!
2,Disappointment,"This wagon was much smaller than depicted in the pictures. A small child would be uncomfortable after a short period of time sitting in it, as the pictures showed. The dimensions were from wheel to wheel, not the body of the wagon. The age range was 1 to 4, but a 2-year old will be too big for playing with this. It will probably be used as a decoration, rather than a toy. It was also missing the clicker. For the money, it was a huge disappointment."
1,Made in China,"I was going to buy a couple of these, for my daughter and nephew but realized that the country of origin was not mentioned on the website. So I called and the customer support lady informed me that this and the little push car are made in china. Is anything from radio flyer made in the USA anymore? Now I'm just going to make the wagon at home, because I can and I don't like making our trade deficit worse."
4,"Need long straight halls, doesn't turn well","Love how well it's made, but not that it's made in China!We don't have the best house for this because it doesn't turn that easily for a baby who doesn't know how to walk.If your baby walks, than I'm sure he can turn it fine, but then whats the point. I think it's the best made walker out there, it soid and won't tip over. Just make sure if you get any walker, you have enough straight halls/area for you baby to cruise or they'll get bored with it quickly.Again, I was very upset to find out this is made in China!"
5,Great wagon!,Our little one loves this wagon - he started pushing it a month or so before he could walk on his own. Classic.
3,Good walker and cart,"This walker is nicely designed. My toddler likes to cart is around, put stuff in it, and take off and replace the sides. That being said, he doesn't play with it often.It helped him learn to walk although it was a little lightweight for his BIG size. We ended up weighting it with barbells and that gave him enough weight to balance against. Most normal-sized walkers or early walkers will be able to push it without a problem."
5,My son LOVES this wagon!!!,My son is just learning to walk so my Mom bought him this wagon. He climbs up on it and walks with it across our living room!!! It's so cute! He also likes to load up the cart with his favorite toys for a ride. We take it to the park sometimes and all the kids come over to play with it. It's a popular little cart. I love it.
5,Awesome toy!!,My son started using this as a walker when he was 10 months old. He walked on his own at 12 months. He is now 18 months old and still plays with this radio flyer walker EVERY SINGLE DAY. The side rails of the wagon have come off (my son can climb in and out) and the variety of play for this toy is excellent. So glad we chose this walker. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
3,Missing hardware - assembled incorrectly from the factory,"I bought this for my nephew's first birthday after reading so many great reviews of this product. When I received the wagon there were two pieces of hardware missing, and one of the brackets to hold the guard-rail was attached in the wrong place. Very disappointed in Radio Flyer's quality control on this product."
5,Love the wagon!,"This is a beautiful little wagon!! I thought my 14 month old might enjoy it and I was right. She loves to fill it with toys, and her 4 year old brother, and push it around the house. It's a lovely little radio flyer product."
4,"High quality, but a little hard to maneuver","PROS:- high-quality, sturdy construction- wooden ""sides"" are removable, for more versatility- great for learning walkers (wheels offer slight resistance)- good for indoor or outdoor play- little ones can sit in it, if one or two sides are removed- easy to keep it moving in a straight lineCONS:- a little hard to maneuver around turns (none of the wheels ""turn"" to the left or right)"
3,recall on classic walker wagon,The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)has issued a recall of past models of this wagon because of the safety hazard posed by the clickers coming off--many people have commented on this danger in the reviews here. Go to [...] to get more info on which models were recalled and how to get the clicker replacement kit.
2,Be on the lookout,"My son enjoys pushing this wagon back and forth across our den. I am sure he would enjoy pushing it around the rest of the house but a child can't turn corners with this toy. Some things we like about the wagon: great place to keep his toys out of the floor; occupies him taking toys out and putting them back in. Some things I DON'T like: like another person noted, the plastic clickers break off and then wagon will really take off across the floor, especially if you have hard wood/laminate floors (the ""clickers"" must be the ""innovative resist push feature""); also the nuts that screw on to mount the wheels are constantly becoming loose. I have found one on the floor and was just glad I discovered it before my son did. I guess it will have to be superglued to keep them on.So, be on the lookout for breaking and missing pieces that are just the right size for practicing the ""pincer grasp"" and ""self-feeding"". No five star rating here due to these safety concerns."
5,awesome fun!,"this little wagon is the most fun you can have or watch. children 3 1/2 years, 11 months - walking, 8 months,and 5 months. the older walkers pushed the little ones sitting inside, they could share a ride. Everyone was safe because it does not just roll away, there is good control even for the 11 month old. We had such a good time with this wagon. Hours of fun!"
4,A great wagon and infant push toy.,"I don't have a lot to say about this wagon. Was at first a little hesitant to get it, thought that I should maybe opt for a full size wagon, but I'm really glad we did get it. Our son has fun walking around the house with the help of this wagon and he also enjoys putting toys and other objects inside to take for a ride. The quality of the wagon is so far meeting my expectations. Most of the parts are wood except for the thick metal handle. The wheels are the only part of this wagon that I feel could be improved as far as quality. Overall, we are very happy with it."
4,Great for learning to walk,My son loves this wagon. We got it for him because he was pushing dining room chairs around-- this is a much better alternative! This wagon is sturdy and heavy enough that it won't slip out from under him. It was easy to assemble and seems very well made.
3,Nice Toy,"I bought this toy for my 13 months son who started walking at 9 months. He likes to ""play"" with it sometimes but it is kind of hard to manuver around corners so it always seems to get stuck. It's very well made and durable, but I wish it was a little easier to push around corners. I think it would be better for a beginner walker."
4,Son loves it...a pain to put together,"My son loves this wagon. He loves pushing it around and he's even had a few rides in the cab! This wagon was a huge pain to put together because one of the pieces didn't fit properly and I had to drill my own holes. In the process, I chipped off a piece and glued it back together.This required a lot of tools and coordination to put together but my son loves it so it was (mostly) worth the hassle."
5,Versatile Wagon,"We have had this walker wagon for a week and are thrilled with it. My 7 1/2 month old loves to sit in it and get rides courtesy of his brothers and sister. He even likes to sit in it just to play with some toys without getting pushed around. His brother thinks that the baby likes it because it is ""cozy"". The older kids like to use it to round-up toys and roll them to the toybox. Of course, a few months down the road, the baby may use it as a walker. The best part of this wagon is that it has multiple uses. The baby has konked his head on the metal handlebar, but I just pinned a soft cloth around it to solve that problem. I like the sturdy construction."
3,deliverysucked,i bougt this little walker for my friend who lives in korea. and i was over exited to get this one for her daughter's 1st b-day. when i got the package i was shocked... because both sides of the rim was broke.... i had no time to return it and get the new one and pack it to ship it to korea. so i had to glue them and ship it. i was so disappointed...
3,Radio Flyer Classic Walker Wagon,"I wanted this walker wagon for my oldest daughter when she was younger but it was too pricy. Now it's gone down in price, we bought it for our younger daughter. It's good for cruiser babies to learn to balance and walk forward than cruise side-to-side on the sofa all the time. It's not that great of a toy afterwards because the wheels only go straight and it's too heavy for children to lift and turn altogether. It's expensive overall because it's a short phase of 'learning to walk' and then the toy doesn't serve much functional purpose afterwards. The makers should consider opting the front wheels to turn/not. They made clickers on the walker wagon removable and they should have done the same with front wheels too. I say pass on this toy."
5,Fantastic walker wagon,We bought this for my daughter's first birthday and she wasn't walking yet. At her birthday party she immediately started walking with it and has loved it ever since. The resistance is great because it won't let her go to fast and now she loves to push her toys around the house. I highly recommend this!
1,PVC use!,"Hi, unfortunately, I have to ship this item back. Not because I do not like the way it looks or works. When I opened the box, I was surprised how wonderful this product was. Then I started to smell the paint. First I thought it is just because it is new and did not want to pay to much attention to it. Later, I took a closer look at the wheels - PVC! That was it! Now I kind of connected the smell of the paint. If they are using toxic PVC why would not they use a non safe paint? I am returning it today."
3,"expensive, worth it, but adapt for best use","we like this toy and splurged on it for our son's first birthday (even though he is only 10 mo now) because he wants to walk but needs help. The wagon goes WAY too fast for him so my husband put a 15 lb dumbbell in the wagon and that helped slow it down. It looks nice but it isn't the quality we expected. i could be wrong but it feels like particle board. That concerns me only because my son uses his outside. i'd buy it again, given the same choice, but recommend looking for a used one first..."
3,"Too fast for baby walker on hardwood floors, too heavy for carpet use","I give this 3 stars b/c I purchased this in hopes that my son could use this as a baby walker. Totally doesn't work for that function. it's too fast, even with the adjustable speed mechanism. I have hardwood floors. when i put this on the carpet, opposite effect-- he couldn't push at all b/c it was too heavy. i would give it less stars if it weren't for the fact that it's super duper sturdy. i love quality!overall, not a great baby walker, but a good push toy for a toddler. my son's 3 now."
3,OK but some flaws,"Essentially it is great for what it is intended to do - it is heavier and able to be rolled more slowly for beginning walkers. And since it has all that space in the cart, i actually used a few yearbooks to weight it down a bit more.However, all of the wooden rails come out, so of course that is all my Zoe wants to do with it. take out the wood rails and then climb inside of it, which makes me nervous. so i wish the rails had someway of locking in, but other than that, good purchase."
5,Baby's first walker.,"Incredible quality. Looks adorable. We bought this for our baby's 1st bday, within a few weeks he could walk on his own. He still loves to push it around. Put stuff in and take it out. By far the best thing we've ever purchased for our son."
4,"Excellent, if it would just turn...","The only downside is that the wagon does not turn, so every time my son hits a wall, we have to go and turn it for him. He still enjoys his wagon even now that he is walking on his own, especially since he realized that he can take the sides off by himself."
4,Great for learning how to walk,"My son is in the process of learning how to walk, so I thought a walker wagon would be great. This one is very durable and has that retro look to it. Like most walkers, if your child is in the beginning stages of walking, it might take off too fast. With this walker though, you are able to put things in it to slow it down a bit. We put his toys in it. My only con is that it doesn't turn, so once he reaches a wall he just keeps jamming the wagon into the wall. Besides that, it's been a great wagon."
2,"good idea, but not worth the 70 bucks","We got this push walker in hopes that the weight and bulkiness would give my daughter who is cruising the confidense to start walking with it. Unfortunately the non swivel wheels combined with the weight make it nearly impossible to turn for me, let alone my 11 month old. It is really sturdy and well built but the 'clickers' that are supposed to give it resistance are to soft and they really dont work at all.(i think with all the complaints of the clickers breaking off and becoming a choking hazard they changed the compasition of the plastic to soft plastic so they cant break and in turn fails to its job.) I really do like this as a wagon to have the older, stronger kids play with and put things into but not very good for babies who are just starting to walk."
1,"Not for ""Everyman""","This DVD is listed as the only film version of this Middle Ages play. I was not impressed with the production values, sound, image or acting.I appreciate the effort, but not the end result. I had purchased the DVD for possible viewing by theatre students, but decided not to share or recommend it after viewing it myself.It is worth a viewing, but not that memorable."
1,No man should buy Everyman,"This is by far the worst film I have viewed in a long time. It appears to be an independent student production shot very badly on digital cameras...home cameras. The editing is bad, with repetitious shots (like in a cartoon) and the picture cuts out at one point and cuts back into the next scene with Good Deeds, and from that point on, the sound does not match up to the action/speaking. The director's choices are just odd, along with many of the costume choices as well. The acting is not particularly good, and it is only updated in setting...the dialogue remains true to an early translation. The two contrast badly. I don't doubt they all worked hard on this production, but sadly, the result is definitely not worth the money...or time to attempt to view it...unless you want a good example of bad film making."
5,excellent,The movie was excellent and the movie played excellent. The case was in perfect shape with no cracks or scraches
5,Bike mania,"My 4 year old grandson is obsessed with motorcycles and loves this movie. He also likes ""Michael, Michael Motorcycle."" If you have a child who likes bikes and things that go fast, I recommend this movie."
5,Delish Glucerna Snack Bars for diabetics,This was a re-order from Amazon. These snack bars taste great and your blood glucose does not spike up after eating it. They sure do taste alot better than peanut butter on saltine crackers before bed....
2,"seems to help avoid hypoglycemia, but cloying! Yuk!","Although Glucerna seems to help avoid low blood glucose, it is sweet, sweet, sweet! And, ironically, full of things that are otherwise bad for you, like transfat and palm oil, and little that is good. Another brand of diabetic snack bar is not likely to be worse, and almost certainly would be better. The makers of this bar don't care about our health: just our money."
1,Why the delay?,"It's nearly a month, and I'm still waiting for this delivery. Diabetics depend on these snacks, is why they were ordered in bulk."
5,A Team of Two,I really enjoyed this book. Kate Ross is a very strong character in this book. Hiram is a hoot!!! IF YOU LOVE A GOOD WESTERN YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE.
2,"An Important Topic, but...","I think the author really wanted to write about important and troubling events, but I don't think these were the right characters or story for the task. I didn't find the characters to be likable or compelling, and I was waiting for the inevitable revelation, but when it came, it just didn't pack much of a punch. Jae-Suk Lee has some talent as a writer, but I think a simpler subject would have been a much better way to express that talent."
3,Interesting read,"I will admit at times the book did tend to drag. I still kept reading it because I wanted to know who committed the crime. Family full of greedy, selfish people. All except Bailey Walker and her husband. Bailey is a loving wife and mother who has a catering business. By her family she is seen as the Goody Two shoes. Perfect to take the fall for a crime. The book is mysterious. My only complaint, the book had a strange ending."
2,Confused???,I didn't consider this a romance at all. Too many cardboard characters and too many references to other mystery writers and mystery books. The writer may be a myster fan but I am not. I had a hard time caring about any of the characters in this book. If I had to read one more time about how large the main character's husband was I could scream. What was this guy? A brick wall? Boring.
5,Gorgeous Book,I bought this book for my mother. We're planning a trip to NZ and it's wine country. Amazing photography.
1,Terrible taps,"I bought 2 sets, both taps broke while trying to tap aluminum! Terrible quality, never again."
1,Frank deserves better,"This is yet another mixed up jumble of recordings. Something else to make money , It belittles Sinatra, I wonder if any of the Sinatra production team would have sanctioned this. Sorry not for me."
3,One can do a WHOLE LOT better with Sinatra purchases,"There are two fundamental problems with this box set: 1. These recordings are not his original versions of these songs. 2. No Sinatra box set of merely three CDs is adequate, unless you are not serious about The Chairman. Because this is Frank we're talking about, this still gets three stars."
2,Missing Moments,"In 1969 they used to run commercials on the radio for record albums, usually playing a sampling of the cuts. I remember this one was strong enough to make ME want to go get it. The real key was where Concerto For The Clouds kicks in. For whatever reason (broken master, incompetent transfer) the meat of the whole album is MIA. The 2 missing moments occur at 1:00:604 and 1:05.967 on Track 4. It was worth my while to rebuild them from a 38 year old reel tape. If you ain't got that YOU ARE SCREWED. Also Track 9 has multiple unidentifiable glitches. (Thet don't quite LOOK like record pops)If anybody posts this album I'll see if they are interested in the approximated commercial soundtrack (made whole). These guys were a defacto house band at the Cellar after The Shadows Of Knight and Saturday's Children. The Who and Cream also played there and these guys (in the same league musically) deserve a better CD."
3,Terribly Re-Mastered!!,"I purchased this CD with the hope that they didn't kill the sound of analog completely with the processing. Sorry to say that modern technology has once again butchered the warmth of analog for the sake of a ""pop and skip"" free recording. This is what happens when the personnel in the studios are tone deaf! Some things are better left alone. Never saw this group perform, but did see the group they evolved to - Madura. Way ahead of their time."
3,A movie for fans of Willy Nelson,"Well its not a Willy Nelson western, but its an OK movie. Have seen better, but I've also seen a lot worse."
4,Just fine,"These are basically fancy versions of the plastic packaging that you get when you buy something like bedding. They may be thicker plastic and they do have the handles. They are reasonably well made, but they will bust if you over stuff them...but I was suprised how much I could overstuff before they busted....then you can just use ducktape if you need to repair. I bought a few and they work well for my use. If you stack them they will not slide well since they are plastic. The zipper seems good enough quality....when mine busted it wasn't at the zipper. They are not waterproof since the zipper is connected with cloth but they'd be great for hauling wet swimsuits, life jackets or snow stuff. It depends on what you'll use them for but I like them."
2,Cancer warning on package,"I just received these and there's a very small warning label on the outside package that the product description doesn't mention: ""Warning: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" That's a little worrisome considering what you may store in the cases.And it's true - these are a little small though I knew that when I purchased them. They're large enough for sheets, small pillows, baby clothes... just consider given the cancer warning label!"
1,Awful,"Very poorly made. One of the bags was already split at a seam when I got it.Also, for anyone who wants something that is moth-resistant, look elsewhere. The holes where the rope handles go into the bag have enough of a gap to allow insects to enter."
1,Medium storage chests,I have only one positive thing to say about these. They are sturdy. The size is a joke. Don't plan on putting much of anything in them. If these are medium I 'd hate to see a small.
5,Neat Chests,"Loved these chests! I especially liked the handles. It makes it so much easier to move them after filling. I also liked the shape. It was easy to put blankets in, since you do it through the top, not the sides, like most of the other vinyl storage bags. It had room for two blankets each, which was great. The shape is also nice because they stacked and fit my shelf perfectly."
2,Did not fit many sweaters in it,I did like it. I was only able to fit a few sweaters in it. Never kept an open shape.
2,Cheap but they serve the purpose,"I should've kept the plastic bags comforters have come in, in the past, and had a better quality bag. These serve the purpose I needed them for but I would suggest that you save your comforter bags for future use! :-)"
3,Really Swell Effort,Cool voice. Cool lyrics. Interesting Sentiment. Can anyone really be that sensitive without sounding forced? Something to ponder.
1,This is sooooooooooooooo bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The songs are (...) bad,and the Bratz dolls are too.BAD SONGS,MEAN (...)They are (...) ugly like the boys.(...)"
2,argh,"This movie exists only to sell a lot of toys. How do I know? The movie is not even out yet and there's a mtherload of toys. I, for one, think bratz movies are bad because they have no apperant moral, and are just commercials for dolls.P.S. I heard on a pamphlet that shows movie content it said this movie contains MILD SEX/NUDITY!!!"
4,The heart of Steeleye Span strike again,Two of the core members of Steeleye Span get together to share more progressive English folk music. Maddy Prior & Tim Hart have been with Steeleye Span since the beginning and it really shows! There polished repartee is a lot lighter on electrical instruments and has more vocals than most Steeley Span music. THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD!
5,made ton of difference compared to my old one,I never knew for 2 years my fuel pump was bad until it went totally dead. then i put this one in & my 2.2 s10 had a ton of power to climb hills & accelerate compared to what it had the whole time i owned it since bought used. I always thought it was lacking in power due to small engine size but it was due to a worn fuel pump. also the s10's had issues with a wiring harness connector at the pump connection which this replaces as well. This was way cheaper than other places i searched for the pump. I was not willing to buy a pump from autozone due to the poor quality of the brand compared to this pump.
1,Terrible...,"I thought this would be a good movie as I usually like Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell, but it was awful. I feel asleep during the first 30 minutes of this movie the first time I watched it. So, I watched it again and it was still a bad film. Andie was very stiff with her lines and the characters (especially hers) were unlikeable to say the least. Won't waste my time watching this one again!"
2,just o.k.,All of the funny sections of this movie were in the previews. The rest of the show was pretty dull.
1,HORRIBLE Do not waste your time,The movie was absolutely horrid! I was looking for something fun to watch with family and a son about to be married. I mentioned that 19902 had great movies--but this was totally stunk. I was ashamed I bothered to watch it. Both main characters were ridiculous people. I absolutely thought Hugh Grant was the most wishy washy sleazy shmuck ever and Andie McDowell was such a tramp. yuck.
3,4 Weddings--What's the bid deal?,"I don't understand why this movie got so much hype. While I love to watch Andy McDowell and Hugh Grant, one viewing of this movie was plenty enough for me."
2,Tedious,"The film was tedious and dry. Zero chemistry between McDowell and Grant. An uninteresting disappointment, the film was disengaging and nearly vapid. A few comical moments couldn't save this bore."
1,"God, it's awful","What a hideous movie! I was furious when it was done because I had just wasted two hours watching a movie that has nothing to recommend it. This movie is neither funny nor inspiring.It was interesting in the beginning. Will the two main characters get together? My sympathy for Andie McDowell's character slipped when she had sex with Hugh Grant while engaged to someone else, and disappeared altogether when she recalled one by one her many lovers (32 of 'em). It's impossible for me to believe that she would remain faithful while married.Hugh Grant's character was not much better. When he couldn't have Andie, he asked someone else, someone who was absolutely crazy about him. Too bad the plot required that she be left at the altar.The only characters I liked were the two gay guys (what an incredible poem one read at the other's funeral).The two main characters were sexual slimeballs. I hated this movie."
5,Forwedfun,"We were surprised at the secure wrapping. and further surprised when the DVD opened without fuss since our zoning was never stipulated. And the film was clear and bright, but better, hilarious. We are looking forward to watching it again to pick up on the subtle nuances and oblique lines."
5,Join the Celebration!,"Four Weddings & A Funeral was a hilarious film about dealing with the absurdity of attending these functions. Hugh Grant is adorable as a typical bumbling Englishman while Andie McDowell was wonderful as the beguiling American who sweeps Hugh off of his feet. I could relate to many of the goings on at the weddings. Unfortunately I empathized with the character of Scarlett who had trouble getting the blokes that she liked but was not interested in the blokes that liked her! All in all, a lot of fun to watch."
4,It was a nice movie,it is one of those english movies that you had to see from the start in order to understand it but it was a beauitful story .
4,No words can describe the impact the characters gave,"I own this DVD and I have to admit the only reason I got it was because of John Hannah (The Mummy and Sliding Doors), who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. When his partner dies, he gives the most heartwrenching euology to ever be released from a mouth. The DVD specials aren't more spectacular than any others, but just the fact that you can skip from an embarassing moment with Hugh Grant to a depressed Kristen Scott Thomas is worth it enough. Oh yeah, and then there's John Hannah's quick and intelligent comments that will leave you rolling in the aisles!"
5,"A true classic. Don't ponder, just buy it.","I'm not going to rehash or give a play by play. Four weddings will always remain on top of my all time list. The wit in this gem will give you an abdominal workout.Own it! .................................Signed, Fun Husband"
2,Tasteless.,"I never cared for Four Weddings and a Funeral. Andie MacDowell's character is disgusting, she sleeps aronund, plays with Hugh Grant's character affections and never seems to care about anyone but herself. The only reason I give this film 2 stars instead of 1 because this is Hugh Grant's breakout role and he is so charming in this one, god love him! The rest of the cast is annoying and wooden, if you want an intelligent british comedy then I recommend Bridget Jones's Diary which also has Grant as the romantic lead."
2,Four Weddings and a Funeral in need of another funeral...,"The truth be told, I am not a real fan of Hugh Grant. His mumbling style, the constant running of his hands through his hair, and his ""blank look"" look are his trademarks, and they are unique in only one movie. After that, they are old, old, old.Then there is the plot of Four Weddings and a Funeral. Hugh Grant's character, along with all of his friends, have no life other than bumbling along at weddings and funerals. It seems that Grant's ""profession"" is trying to have a constant stream of sleeping partners.I enjoyed the scenes in England. I think the actors were being paid by the number of times they flashed their teeth while smiling.All the characters were shallow, shallow, shallow. And... well, the scenery was nice.Four Weddings and a Funeral is clearly in need of another funeral... itself."
3,"enjoyable, but with caveats","IF you don't read the printed insert (which gives away all the jokes and comic situations and thus spoils the movie) and IF you don't mind Hugh Grant's excruciating method of delivering his lines (which grind the pace almost to a standstill every time he's on screen), you'll enjoy this movie. It's a look at life among the British hipper class, and many of the gags really happened to the screenwriter at actual weddings.Andie MacDowell is a delight in her usual quiet way, and the rest of the supporting cast add spice to this tasty confection.If Hugh Grant would work with a speech therapist, he might become as charming as he thinks he is. With another lead, I would have given the movie four stars."
2,SUPERFICIAL AT BEST,"Nice visually but superficial. Parading the usual Hollywood values""Sleeping around is a positive thing"". ""self centeredness"" also very positive. Funnily enough the funeral was the best part of the movie and john Hannah's eulogy the highpoint of the film. I like Andie MacDowell But her role was pretty much confined to looking pretty and sensitive. Hugh Grant just bumbled. I am not sure it deserves even a 2."
3,"Witty Romance, Weak DVD","This film starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell was quite a popular hit when released in theatres and was nominated for Oscars. The characters are well developed and the supporting cast is terrific. There are many great one-liners and the accompanying music is enjoyable. I consider this movie one of the best romantic comedies of the 90s. However, MGM has only occassionally produced outstanding DVDs. Unfortunately, this DVD has some artifacts, pixelation, and bare bones content. I was disappointed in the visual and sound quality for a film made so recently (within the last ten years). I would recommend this DVD only if you are a big fan of this film or don't demand quality and rich content in your DVDs."
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD","This was a very good movie. Hugh Grant is charming and funny in a clumsy way. Andie MacDowell is cute and charming as well. The cast as a whole is terrific. I recommend this movie to all. The DVD on the other hand, was very poor. I have watched a lot of DVDs in the past year and this was one of the worst. I felt like I was watching a VHS tape. The picture was very bland and the colors were muted. I know the English are pale, but this DVD transfer did not do them any justice. On top of the poor video quality, the sound was just as awful. The volume was very low, and jumpy at times. The dialog at times didn't come through clearly and there was no use of the surround channels. This movie could use a thorough update to the entire pakage. A new video transfer, a new audio 5.1 channel mix and some extras would have made this a top DVD. Instead MGM decided to skip all the goodies technology has to offer to keep the price of this DVD down. Too Bad, Its a Great Movie."
2,"Great movie, bad dvd transfer","As a movie I will rate it 4 stars, but the video quality is very bad, lot of artifacts, blury images, MGM transfer is really a big disappointment."
2,Five Star Classic -- Two Star HD Transfer,"Don't get me wrong. The movie is brilliant and a timeless, classic comedy. Unfortunately, Fox and MGM video didn't see it that way and dusted off an ancient HD master, putting no TLC whatsoever into this Blu-ray release.This film deserves nothing less than a full 6k restoration from the original camera negatives and audio elements. What you get here instead is a wobbly, scratched, and dirty print with gobs of edge enhancement slapped on to try and beef up the inherent softness in the image. Don't let the extremely high average MPEG-4 video bitrate listed on the package fool you... it's the old adage of garbage in, garbage out.It reminds me a lot of the typical cruddy treatment Universal heaps upon its catalog titles (unless it happens to be named ""E.T."" or ""Jaws""... and then Laser Pacific does the work).It's nothing short of shameful."
4,Five stars if no Andi,"I am an anti-Andi McDowell fan. I avoid her mvies and don't buy products she advertises. In fact I make faces at the television screen as she shows us her luscious locks. But I liked this movie despite her because it is funny, sweet, sad, and charming. I even moved to England to meet my own English man (so far, no luck). If they had only used a different American actress, I wouldn't be able to give this enough accolades."
3,Mild entertainment,"This film passes one's time reasonably pleasantly. However, if one is looking for laughter, one should look elsewhere. The story line and development are thin; indeed, we basically do just attend four weddings and a funeral, watching the lead actor struggle with his desire to avoid commitment."
4,"A Good Look At Life, Love, & Laughter.","Although a comedy, there are some serious, sad moments in this film. By far one of Hugh Grant's best films.This movie will show the importance of love in life. No matter how much one thinks they can do without love, they may never be truly happy.Grant's character is quite the playboy. He is completely in love with an American girl, while all of the other girls are either in love with him or hate his guts.This movie will have you laughing outloud. So, if you need a good laugh, but don't want a Dumb (or Dumber) movie, then this is the one for you."
2,Boring,I thought I was at my own funeral and didn't want to be there. Another Hugh Grant goody-two-shoes part. Would someone please find this man a real character part. Please...he does have talent.
1,"Quite simply, the worst film ever made.","Where to begin with this cack? Any film made for ?middle Americans about Britain/the British is going to be heading for the file marked ""For the Hard of Thinking"".Think Friends (in London), think Austin Powers, think Dudley Moore, in fact don't think. Just leave your brain at the video counter when you rent this.How this cringing pot-boiler passed the British Board of Censorship is beyond me. No tired cliche is left unturned, no stereotype is not brought from the grave, plotlines don't turn left or right they chunder onwards to the final scene where even in terms of nauseating feel-good Hollywood endings for the emotionally-challenged they go some. You expect everybody to give each other a PC Telly Tubby-style Big Hug.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a diatribe against American thinking, merely the mince that you get when you cater for the lowest denominator - ie money."
1,Beyond awful characters...,"Deliriously unfunny flick about Dysfunctional British White Trash Set starring that English guy with sticky big tooth grin who can't stop ""acting"" as if were 14 years old (O.K. 8 years old). McDowell's set in granite smile even more putrid as was her ameba like portrayal of worthless All American tramp.It goes without saying that only the two homosexuals would be portrayed as being half way decent and not altogether mindless.Film pinned a phony Valentine on characters at the tail end, can't say why other than to relieve viewers suffering. Actually, couldn't take more than 40 minutes of it. Didn't matter because if you only see the first 20 min. that will be sufficient (they didn't title this one Four Wedding for nothing). Reappeared during the last five to see dumb resolution. Didn't buy a word of it. Doesn't matter because NOTHING about these characters mattered. Sickening making. Typical European yuck and snot.No surprise that it went over big in America."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Four Weddings and a Funeral is marred slightly by the presence of Andie McDowell, who may give viewers the impression that Hugh Grant ends up with the wrong woman; aside from that blip, however, the film is a completely successful merger of romance, comedy, and pathos."
2,Overrated,"The hype surrounding Four Weddings when it was first released in the UK made me imagine it must me a great movie. What does everyone see in it? Grant is irritating and a stereotypically English upper-class boy, which is getting tirelessly overused in movies. The ""quaint"" weddings and eccentricity and aloof nature of the women are just as bad. If you want to see a real British movie, watch Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels instead. Four Weddings is a big disappointment."
1,"IT WOULDN""T PLAY",".....and there is no tech support that I could find and no response two days later from the email I sent.Bought it for three times the price the same night on iTunes and it played perfectly, however, and I LOVE THE MOVIE"
4,"Hugh Grant playing Hugh Grant, as only he can","A runaway bestseller of a romantic comedy in England's best tradition. Tongue-in-cheek performances by Hugh Grant playing the bumbling, shambling, confused, stammering, charming, adorable, hopeless man as only he can do it, and Andie MacDowell, who is as smooth and composed as Grant is most decidedly NOT. He's a confirmed bachelor going to friends' weddings when he runs into her, and then a funeral intervenes. Then her wedding. Then his upcoming one...On and on it goes. We know how it's going to end. The surprising thing is that in spite of the predictability, it's full of pathos, charm, and some heartbreaking scenes that stick with viewers long after the final credits roll.Don't miss it."
1,Unfortunate Stereotypes,"Are we to believe that women are and were limited to glory gained through antisepsis? Did not one of these women pick up a musket or, drenched in sweat and driven by the Glory of God drive a bayonet deep into a Rebel chest after seeing the glow of youth snuffed from a Union boy? Affluent woment like these were skilled at fencing, riding and were often strong of spirit and no stranger to whiskey. The author has merely repeated the ""santitized"" version of their service, for no contemporary scribe dare record the valor of the ""weaker sex"" and by the emphasis of this book, perpeturates this error."
3,Overrated Lewton production,"Lewton and Tourneur do the best they can and are always good for a chilling atmosphere, but this one, in spite of what most people say, is not as good as I Walked with a Zombie or The Body Snatcher. I felt such immense pity for the Serbian girl's plight, and very little sympathy for her American husband and future second wife, and so the movie struck me as incredibly sad rather than frightening. The oft-cited swimming pool and bus hydraulic scenes have dated badly. Simone Signoret, even in a fit of jealous rage, is cute as a button. But, hey: Give me a good Val Lewton movie over any modern slasher borefest."
5,Everybody knows it's the place to be!,"I think the Reverend put it best himself in song 5 Yeah!...if you're looking for groovy rock with naughty rifffs and that make you wanna scorch your shorts you're search has ended. Live......T Rex would be proud. Get it, these boys rock."
3,"Pretty good, but not the greatest","I liked this book overall, but it was just ""ok"" after reading Stephen Davis' book on Aerosmith. That book has a lot more info. Some people are actually interested in the childhood of Steven Tyler, more background info, ect. This book brags about not having it."
4,Great Book for a Great Band,"I read ""Aerosmith: The Rise and Fall of Rock's Greatest Band"" It was fabulous. Not only does it help me understand the band and what they went through, but it also helped me learn so much about them. The chapters went in perfect order, and the book actually made me want to read more about Aerosmith. The book was awsome, and very educational. I give it a great reveiw and hope more people read it. ^A^ rocks!"
4,THE GREATEST ROCK BAND'S LIFE STORY,THIS BOOK IS ALL ABOUT HOW 5 YOUNG MUSICIANS DESRIRED TO BECOME STARS CAME TO LIFE. IT STARTS OUT TALKING ABOUT STEVEN TALLARICO (TYLER'S REAL LAST NAME) AND HIS CHILDHOOD AND HOW HE MET JOE PERRY. ABOUT ALL THE TURMOIL THE BAND HAD IN THE LATE 70S WITH DRUGS (ESPECIALLY JOE AND STEVE). HOW THEY REFORMED IN 1984 FOR THE BACK IN THE SADDLE TOUR AND RE-JOINED FOREVER.
3,A good start,"If you're only mildly interested in Aerosmith, this book makes a nice place to start. A fairly breezy and quick read through the band's turbulent history. If you read this and decide you want more, ""Walk This Way"" might be the next step for you."
2,Info that is already Well known!,"This book was interesting for the Aerosmith Novice But Hard-core fans already know the info published in this book!! Aerosmith is one of the wealthiest bands in the world We would like to hear what the spend it on Jets,Cars,Houses Etc.... Because they dont give much to charity"
5,"Jackie, I love you...","""Nurse Jackie"" is a spectacular series, and Edie Falco is unbelievably perfect in the role. Add Merritt Wever as 'Zoe', her sidekick co-worker, and you've got an amazing hospital staff that will entertain and surprise you for many, many hours."
3,Nurse Jackie Season 3,Very close to jumping the shark. Some of the characters are overacting and less pallatable. First and second season were excellent. Edie Falco is fantastic but others don't rise to the occasion.Video in great condition and came as advertised.
5,Great show,"I love it!! This is a great series and would highly recommend this to any one, I will say start with season one"
2,Maybe it's just me.......,"Sadly disappointed by both the price ( which is now dramatically reduced already )and the content. Seems things come and go much more quickly, and have little depth to them. We're here, we're there, we're gone to the next event. It appears to be just an extension of the series, rather than a moving on of events, if that makes any sense. It left me with a great feeling of disatisfaction/disappointment, and if there IS a season 4, I will probably not invest in it.I DO love the cast, and the roles they play.It's also a big pain to have to FF through the entry, Last time on Nurse Jackie, and the credits which make up too much of the running time."
1,Missing item,How can I review a product I have still not received? Also both Season One and Season two have also not arrived.
1,Doesn't play on Australian blu-ray players,"So disappointed, I waited 3 weeks for it to arrive and it doesn't play on my blu-ray player due to region conflict. And there is no release date in Australia yet :-("
4,Gumshoes going nowhere,"Most novelizations are dreadful hackwork but if the source material isn't awful in the first place and the material is given to a writer with some talent and drive, the result is a book that is good enough to stand as a decent piece of work on its own. Hickey & Boggs is just such a book. It isn't Shakespeare but it isn't meant to be; instead it is a perfectly acceptable pulp crime novel, something like an old Fawcett Gold Medal from the fifties or sixties and Philip Rock does an admirable job of translating Walter Hill's screenplay into an enjoyable afternoon time-killer."
2,Not Impressed,"I was not impressed with this book. It seems that the author was going for breadth but in his attempt neglected to go into the detail necessary for someone unfamiliar with power electronics. I liked the fact that the author introduced many practical considerations but without good coverage of the basics this book is useless except as a reference.In short, lots of coverage, not enough detail."
2,Defective binding,"I bought the soft cover version and it was bound incorrectly: pages 79-110 were inserted in the reverse order and rotated 180 degrees. Um, ugh."
1,pure garbage,"This book is total garbage. I have a BS in EE and wanted to learn more about switching power supply design. This book is useless. Instead of explaining the general operation of boost and buck converters with english words, Krein uses these convoluted switching matrices. It's like the following: here's a circuit, and here's its switching matrix, on to the next cicuit. Not insightful in the least bit. He should spend more time explaining with English words what is going on in a circuit instead of just throwing a uninsighful matrix at you. It's a typical professor/academic book: too many irrelevant details and not enough on the basics."
3,The obvious,"Nice photographs of what life exists around that we take for granted...the lines, the shapes, the colors, and more. Brings to the surface, beautiful imagery and emotions. Lovely piece."
4,Hole in the Sun,I found the subject matter and content interesting. Red #22 and Blue #20 had some amazing texture and color variation that added depth and contrast to the composition. I enjoyed seeing what caught the attention of the artist.
3,Quality of velcro is actually too good,When taking the pda out of the case it rips the battery cover off every time. I'm using a Dell Axim X50V.
4,Surprisingly Impressive!,"Who would have thought that these accounts of Wagners's Overtures by Gyorgy Lehel leading the Budapest Symphony could possibly be competitive with the many fine versions already available? Not me, and I am happy to say I am very wrong! The strength and power, along with the sensuousness and delicacy, of these masterpieces are beautifully presented by these artists. The Budapest Symphony compares quite favorably to the work of such great Wagner orchestras as the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Phiharmonic and the Chicago Symphony. While conductor Lehel provides leadership that doesn't take a back seat to any of his more famous rivals (i.e. Karajan, Furtwangler, Solti, et al)! A very impressive release with warm, full-bodied sound. And at its price, a steal!"
5,Dyson DC07 Reconditioned Vacuum,Excellent New Quality. Works perfectly. Absolutely good as new at a much better price than available in local stores. Good Buy.
5,Simply the best!!!!,"I bought this refurbished one with a lot of scepticism but I am really happy with my decision... The vacuum is really good...It brought out dirt from my carpet that I didnt know existed in there..The packaging was intact and looked new. It had a ""REFURBISHED"" sticker on the box though. But I think its worth every penny."
3,WHERE IS MY SUCTION??,"One reviewer wrote that he/she could see dust and dirt coming into the vacuum from 2 to 3 METERS around the vac. I sprinkled some Arm & Hammer baking soda on a tile floor, switched over to the ""bare floor"" setting, and took one slow pass over the soda with my Dyson. Only the soda that was directly under the path of the vacuum was cleared away. The soda that lay right next to the vacuum head was undisturbed.Also, while still set on ""bare floor"", I sat my Dyson on a walk-off rug at the entrance to my home. I figured when i turned on my Dyson it would take quite a tug-of-war battle to pull the rug away from the vac to escape the suction. However, by simply lifting the vac, the rug fell away from the suction head with very little fight.My vac was set to all the right settings. The hose attachment end was closed off, not open. Is my Dyson a lemon? Or have some of the other stories been exaggerated??"
1,Horrible service,I bought this vacuum and then found I could not buy attachments. I called Dyson direct and they will not sell product to anyone in New York. So I can't get any accessories for this machine. I have tried on other sites and no luck. If you want a machine with no accessories this machine certainly sucks.
5,WOW!,"This vacuum is AMAZING. It works perfectly - I have 2 golden retrievers who love the dirt and shed like crazy, the dyson is fantastic. It works just like new --- not a thing wrong with it. I dumped 5 containers of hair and dirt out of my living room alone! And it didn't look that dirty to start! This is a great deal (I almost bought this at lowe's for $400) and an awesome vac. it made my day!"
1,Bad choose,"I purchase this vacuum less then a year ago. It does not pick up all the dog and cat hair. I vacuum 2x a day. It also kicks back the dirt and I can feel it hit my feet. ALso, when you take the container out to release the dirt no need to use the release handle, the dirt falls right out and if you do not know this then it is all back on your floor. I paid full price thinking I was getting something good but I was wrong and a waste of money"
4,great!,"This is a great product! After seeing a friend's, I knew I had to have one. We have 2 indoor cats and they track dander and litter onto our burber carpet. It's hard for a regular vac to get it out. The dyson got it all and then some! It is hard to attach the attachments, but it's worth the time."
5,"Great Vaccum, Good Price","This vacuum is awesome. The first time we used it to clean the carpet in our two-story apartment, we had to empty the container five or six times because it picked up so much cat fur and dirt. The suction power is amazing. The attachments are also easy to use and work well. It's well worth the price, and it seemed brand-new, despite being reconditioned."
4,DYSON DOES DARN GOOD!,"I recently purchased a Dyson DC07(refurbished) and I was more than impressed by the thorough pick-up of lint,dirt and dust around my house. Great Job! The only concern I have would be the weight of the vacuum. Not so easy to move around. Overall,I would recommend a Dyson.JAG/Whittier,Ca."
1,"Dyson Makes a VERY loud grinding noise that is ""NORMAL""","I have had my Dyson for about 1 month and it makes a VERY loud grinding noise. I called the help line and they told me that the noise is because my carpet is a Berber carpet and their vacuum is ""too powerful"" to vacuum my carpet and the carpet is ""suffocating"" the brush and causing the clutch to slip. If this really is true then they need to work on their design so that their vacuumed can handle the vast majority of carpets. This same noise occurred at my sister's house as well as at my parents. I would never purchase this vacuumed as this has a very serious problem that must be addressed."
4,Product is great but I was also scammed by the warranty,"The refurbished vacuum looks new and works great - but I too was under the impression from the description on Amazon that it carried a two-year warranty when I purchased it. After I opened the vacuum, used it and read the material that came with it, I discovered it only had a six-month warranty. Quite disappointing, especially since I opened it and used it, and therefore can't return it. Hopefully the Dyson will continue to be a quality product and I won't need to use the warranty. I am disappointed in Amazon, though, for not being accurate in their descriptions. When making an expensive investment in something like the Dyson, it would be nice to know what you are getting."
1,Terrible Product.,"Yeah, Dyson Sucks alright. And not in the way they advertise. $400 + for a vacuum that can't pick up crumbs? This is modern technology?Stay away from Dyson."
4,great vacuum,"Why would you ever buy another vacuum? Seriously, this Dyson picks up EVERYTHING. I love it. Occassionally, I do have to trim my hair from the beater-bar. Sometimes, the button refuses to release the dirt from the cannister, but I have learned to push up on the bottom of the cannister as I pull the release and it works. If this problem was fixed, it would be perfect. Why would you buy several vacuums your life when you could have just one that does a great job forever?"
3,Works great!...and then after a while...it doesn't,"Got this thing and the wife loved it. Unfortunately, it's got some kinda gear in the vacuum head that is poorly made and fails often. When it fails, it makes a horrible grinding noise like feeding human bones into a chipper / shredder. Or something like that, I guess. Anyway, first **TWO** times it failed, Dyson warranty service was as good as their word, and fixed it for free, if you don't count the 30 mile round trip to the repair shop. It's on it's third gear and starting to sound a little grind-ey already, and I've only had this thing for 9 months. It's a great vacuum when it's not broke tho...."
3,"Works great, but plastic was cracked","Bought this reconditioned unit for another residence after having purchaed and used another DC07, a great vacuum. Unfortunately, the reconditioned unit is packed differently in such a way which can put stress on the plastic piece that sits in the front of the sweeper unit. Sure enough, it showed up cracked. Dyson will not send a replacement for this part, so back to Amazon it goes. Now I wonder about the long-term durability of this product. In the meantime, we are enjoying our other Dyson."
4,Dyson's great,"The vacuum is just like new! I love it and it works great. There was a scare in the beginning when it was making a funny noise, but we were able to use the troubleshooting guide that came in the owners manual to resolve."
5,Refurbished Dyson rocks!,"Great vacuum. It worked as new even though I got the refurbished version.The other Central Florida person that got the refurb,returned it, got new gives up too easily. I got mine for $225. Even at $250+ it is a great deal! It is amazing all the dust you pickup with this thing.No complaints whatsoever."
4,Good vacuum at this deal.,"Unit came with no real signs of use. A little dust in canister at most. The unit works great...tons of suction. Sometimes too much. Using the wand wants to suck the vacuum back towards you. It's nice that it's light...but that makes the components light (i.e. easily breakable?). I broke off a very small plastic 'guide' tab about 5 minutes after taking it out of the box.There is a tradeoff between being light weight and durable construction. I think it's a good unit, but I guess I'll reserve final judgement until I see how it holds up over time. You may want to check one out at a brick and mortar store to make sure you're comfortable with the construction.Bottom line: I'm happy with the unit at $279...probably would not have been at $400+ retail."
4,Just OK,"Purchased this model for under $200. It arrived in perfect, brand new condition and seems to operate the way it should. This dc07 model is not as powerful as the dc14 or others, and it is a great vacuum, but was not as powerful as I expected for a dyson. It picks up lots of dirt and carpet fiber, but every string and hair gets caught on the rotating brush instead of going into the canister. VERY annoying! I have to clean the brush 1-2 times for each use. Overall it is a solid vacuum, but knowing it is not as powerful as other models and considering the issues with the brush, there is no way I would pay over $200 for it. I suggest waiting for the price to lower (and it usually does). Likewise, if you have a ton of kids or pets, I would suggest purchasing one of the other dysons , instead of this ""basic"" version. A good value for the money though."
5,The Italian Americans cry too!,"I am embarassed to say that I do not speak Italian, the tongue of my ancestors. In listening to Bocelli, even though I don't understand the words, "" I feel the words, I feel the pain, I feel the sorrow"". Bocelli has inspired me to regain an important piece of my heritage, namely the language, and furthter to pass it on to my children and grandchildren. Then we will truly be able to appreciate the GREATNESS OF BOCELLI.ps: If like the albums, try the video, from the Tucany concert with Nicole Foceli & sara Brighton its to die for!!Michael Gruttadauria ~ Florida"
5,My granson borrowed my cd and forgot to give it back.,"This is the most fantastic music we have ever listened to. My husband and I heard Andrea Bocelli on public tv. we ran right out and bought 3 cd's of his. my family loves it. If he can enchant a 17 year old to listen to his music, he's a miracle worker."
1,Anyone else feel cheated?,"I bought this CD for Con Te Partiro by Brightman & Andrea Bocelli. Mostly Bocelli. There are only four (4) tracks on this CD: one is Bocelli. If you like Bocelli, his other recordings (Bocelli & Il Mare Calma della Sera) provide you with his operatic and popular recordings."
5,magnificently addictive,"I first heard ""Time to Say Goodbye"" watching the Men's ice skating program. Who skated to that song? The 2nd time I heard it was when my husband and I were visiting our good friend , the Commandant at the US Naval Acad. Annapolis MD. He played the ""Romanza"" cd. The 3 of us listened to the cd over and over again, loving every note played and every Italian word sung. My husband and I became addicted to the CD and cassette. We absolutely love it. Andrea Bocelli has a magnificent voice, he is the best male singer so far in my lifetime (54yrs). Ms. Brightman also has a great voice. We would like to know when Bocelli will be performing in the US and if and when he will make any TV appearances. We have bought numerous CD's to give as gifts. We wish Andrea Bocelli continued success."
5,A Most Outstanding Song and Presentation,"I truly love this song and have not been able to get the song out of my head for several weeks now. I wonder if anyone can tell me what the English words are to ""Time to Say Goodbye"". I love it so and I would be forever grateful to anyone who can help me. thank you"
3,Title misleading - very little of Andrea Bocelli singing,"Disappointing when the title indicates both artists are featured. Only the last half of the first song, ""Time to Say Goodbye"" has Bocelli's voice. Out of four total songs, two are the same song."
5,Sarah Brightman A n Ethereal Voiced Angel,"Time To Say Goodbye or ""Timeless"" is an instant classic, Ms. Brightman's vocals are as pure and smooth as silk and her emotional delivery is ravishing at all times. Ms. Brightman's ethereal bell like soprano make every track on this CD a masterpiece, as it is the ultimate union between vocalist, song, musician and song writer. ""Time to say Goodbye"" is a ""Timeless"" classic sure to bring unbridled pleasure to all listeners."
5,Captivating!,I want to tell you that my family is completely captivated by Karen's CD. We play it over and over. Her tunes are so catchy that my husband whistles them around the house. And her voice is beautiful! She is so talented!
5,"Everything else should just take a seat to ""Chainsmoke""","""Chainsmoke"" set a new standard for DH and XC mountain bike videos. Besides having an incredible selection of music, the filming is excellent. If you're looking for an awesome biking video, this is it. Once you've watched this one though, all of the others will seem null in comparison. BUY THIS VIDEO!"
2,Man eating chicken? Lacks charm and resorts to ridiculous plot line.,Started out pretty interesting and promising. But it's like any other Pixar wanna be animations. Has no charms. Predictable and stupid characters. Depends on unoriginally ridiculous actions of the characters to keep the plot going. I'm all for imagination and creativity but the story is so ridiculous it's hard to care for any of it. Hollywood is all about imitation but I guess it's hard to duplicate what the company like Pixar does.
1,This movie was a waste of time....,Very disappointed in this movie...definitely NOT a movie for children! Just boring and a waste of my money and time....NOT recommended!
4,Good fun movie for the whole family,"good movie, with good animation and a nice story for the kids. For those that are complaining about the PSP digital copy, learn to read. It says on the back of the case that is a PSP only digital copy."
1,"""Digital Copy"" is misleading","***Note: This is a review of this DVD format and not the movie itself.***Was disappointed to find that the digital copy does not work with your ipod or computer only a PSP! I have ordered DVD's before that came with ""digital copy"" and have never had this problem before.Had I known that it was not the digital format I required I would have saved the extra $9 and bought the regular DVD. This restriction is NOT clear in the product description. If you were to purchase it in the store you will see a small note on the front cover that mentions it is a digital copy for your Playstation 3, but when purchasing online it is pretty much impossible to see on the photo. I am going to contact Amazon customer service and let them know they need to update the description to include this info."
3,not as good as i thought .,Its quite rediculous and when one says that about an animated movie it means they really pushed it to the limit of redicule . Or maybe I am more dissapointed in the quality of the 3D in this movie that it kept me from seeing its awesoneness? The movie is meh 'but kids will love it.
4,Great movie...poor 3D effects,"I loooove this movie!!! Great story and message. However, I didn't care for the 3D effects. They were very poor and I don't remember anything popping out of the screen or the feeling of being able to touch images from the screen, unlike Monsters vs. Aliens or Despicable Me - way better 3D effects!!!With this movie, I would stick to buying the regular 2D one!!!"
3,beware format,"the movie does play but only in my pc, i cannot watch it any other way i have tried, so please just be aware that the format of the disc may be different to the device you are using to play it. appart from that i am happy with the purchase."
1,Bad Form Sony!,"I love this movie! Hence the reason for buying the Blu-Ray, DVD, Digigtal copy version!What a joke Sony! Restricting the Digital copy to only your devices! I have never ran into this problem with a digital copy movie before. The Digital copy included with this copy will only download on a PS3, and can then be transferred to a PSP. Sony is increasingly making bad decisions and the big loosers are the consumers!!! It started with the PS3 having backward compatibility removed so that it would not play PS2 games, for what reason.... so that we have to buy PS2 consoles.I felt that I was being a responsible consumer by purchasing the digital copy rather then acquiring it through other means. This type of action by labels promotes consumers to seek out other options to retrieve movies for their portable devices. Shame on you Sony!"
4,Great family movie,"I really liked this movie. I remember being very fond of the book when I was a child. Come on, what kid DOESNT want ice cream falling from the sky? The movie was great. It was funny, and it made me feel like a kid again. It brings you into this imaginary world where anything could happen. Never would you really be able to swim in Jello, or eat pancakes from the sky. It takes all the things you would daydream about as a kid and lets you see them for about an hour and a half. The characters are funny, the story has a nice subtle message and it was very pleasing to the eye. If you have kids, you should get this movie for family night. It will be a hit."
4,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are about 45 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 12 around 25%. The in-screen 3D is consistently good. This would make a good addition to any 3D collection.*** Funny with an enjoyable story line - Nice graphics add to the 3D ***MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
4,Entertaining for All Ages,This is the kind of thing kids wish would happen and how cool it would be to have all our favorite foods fall out of the sky… and some adults too! &#61514;Good story line and animation. I would recommend this film for kids of all ages.
4,Very cute adaptation of the book,"While it's not the best animated movie out there by far, it is a very cute movie that even my 2 year old is intrigued by. I recommend."
5,Great recreation of a classic,I used to read this book all the time when I was young. This is a great recreation of the book. And really cool in 3D!!
3,Disappointed with the digital copy,"Overall a good purchase. However I'm rather disappointed with the fact that Sony made the Digital copy for the PSP and Playstation only.. It also seems that most of the special features are on BD-Live (ugh..). Though not as bad as ""Despicable Me"" which streams advertisements on the main menu (calling it new ticker, it's still adverts)."
2,Eh,"This was one of my favorite books as a kid, so I had high expectations for the movie...but unfortunately this movie was just ok. I wish they had followed the real story a little bit more. I mean, c'mon...a giant meatball in the sky? Even my little sister (who also loves the book and wants to read it almost every night) lost interest halfway through."
3,"Cutesy, fun movie for children","The plot is simple, easy, straightforward. This is really a movie for children. The animation style is cute and colorful. I liked looking at the flying food. I still love the book more. I think young children would enjoy this film."
4,Great 3D,The movie has really good 3D and is a good choice if you are looking for something to showcase your new 3D projector. I'm not sure what to say about the movie itself if you have never seen it other than its one of those movies that should appeal to people of all ages. IMO it's that classical formula of overcoming failure to reach great success and getting the girl (or guy I guess) in the process.
4,"Good story, very entertaining!","What a cute movie this is! I love that it comes with lessons. Lots of cool characters to watch. Very colorful and ""out there""!"
3,"Movie is good, but package is a rip off","The digital copy is ONLY for a PSP, AND the unlock code expired a YEAR ago! (may 2011). The expiration date is not printed anywhere on the outside, and there is no warning for this."
5,Wonderful,This is the first time I'm writing a review so I'll make it short. If you love 3D you need to see this one. The 3D affect are very relaxing for the eye. I enjoyed it very much.
5,Great Movie for ALL ages!!,This movie is loved by all in our household (from ages 4-35). It is very funny and has a cute storyline. I would highly recommend this DVD to those who enjoy animated movies!!
3,Corny movie but it's the only 3D one available!,"I'm starting to feel like a guy who bought a BetaMax --- only to find out that everyone else bought a VHS.About every other movie in the past 2 - 3 years was released in 3D and every A/V store in the country was selling 3D TV's and BluRay players --- like the ones I've got on my A/V rack and on my wall.I really love the overall performance and picture on that 46"" Samsung HD/3D LED backlit TV but ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is not the fare of your normal american adult male --- the guys who are willing to spend that kind of money for a TV and BluRay player.This sucks!When are ""adult"" movies going to be released in 3D BluRay --- I'm not talking ""porn"" but something where someone might use an offensive word like ""darn""!"
2,Complete Bore!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a boring movie. the animation is awesome, but the story is so stupid i found myself and my guests (4 nieces and 3 adults) just watching the tv with no laughter or anything. I don't see what anyone saw in this movie. good thing we rented it and wasn't purchased. save your money."
3,Did any try on 3D player???,"Geeze!! you all talk about the movie ~ but my goodness ~ what about the product??? forget about that weak digital crap ~ how is the blue ray 3D part???? You shouldn't even have bought this if just for a digital Download. There are plenty other sources to do that and for a cheaper price. I tried to click ""no"" opinion was NOT helpful on all of your responses but there are soo many I had to give up and look for the answers elsewhere."
1,Worthless digital copy.,"What a complete waste of money. Sure, the Blu Ray is fine, but I wouldn't have paid retail if I'd known the digital copy only works with a Sony PSP/PS3."
1,Kids didn't like it,My kids were gagging during this film. The main character was wierd and the imagery was gross. I got this based on others reviews. Liked the book but the movie tanks.
3,cloudy with a chance of meatballs,"I bought this movie for our pre-schoolers and their families to watch on a big outdoor screen. I think it was a bit too 'old' for preschoolers. They enjoyed the book. They did love being outside, running around and eating snacks with their families though."
4,Not bad.,"Fairly entertaining, although my daughter prefers the Disney movies. Got to stick with the classics some times I guess. Okay."
4,Very cute movier,"Is a very fun and cute family oriented movie.. No dark magic and is easy to watch it with kids,"
4,Great with 3d Vision on the PC,"I watched this movie in 3d on my pc using nvidia 3d vision and cyberlink power dvd 10 ultra mark 2. Very impressive 3d visuals, and the movie isn't bad either."
4,A decent film to show off 3D capabilities!,"So, we bought this movie to test out our new 3D TV. I have played this movie using a Samsung 3D Bluray player as well as the recently updated to 3D Bluray PS3. Overall, it is a cute movie. Nothing really that special, but for those looking for 3D content, this does suffice."
4,3D Is Great,The 3d effects are really good and we enjoyed thius movie adaption of a grreat childrens book. Very well transferred to the big screen.
4,bang for your buck,"I surprisingly enjoyed this movie despite the overwhelming comments about it not being funny or boring. Sure the humor was a little cheesy and a little excessive, but that was what made it its own movie. the 3d effect was consistent but it didnt have the depth that i saw on other movies, but other than that the colors were terrific and the sound superb. If you can get this movie for under $20 i recommend you add this to your collection"
2,Very Disappointing,Absolutely nowhere did the information for this movie on Amazon state that the digital copy was for PSP via PS3 only. I never would have pre-ordered this movie if I had known that. There is a sticker on the cardboard outer cover that states this but the picture on the web shows the case cover that doesn't have the sticker. Very deceptive. From now on I will wait for the movie to come out and read reviews to ensure I can use the digital copy where I please.
4,Good fun,"I bought this movie right after I bought my new 3D TV with only the knowledge that the movie was in 3D. I ended up really enjoying it. It wasn't perfect and a few parts were like 'eh' but kids should really like it and if you're getting it for the 3D, you won't be disappointed."
3,"As with others, very disappointed by Digital Copy","Others have already stated this, but my disappointment is so much that it has driven me to write this review. Most Blu-Ray's that advertise digital copies support multiple platforms. This one only supporting Sony's PSP is a marketing gimmick. You only know it works with PSP in a small section on the back of the case. It should say PSP Digital Copy on the top banner where they only advertise (Digital Copy)."
5,Cloudy with a chance of meatballs ( Blu=ray 3D ),"The 3D is great , I love the way the movie jumps out of the screen. Can't wait for more 3D movies to come out. I just pre ordered the movie MONSTER HOUSE ( Blu-ray 3D )will not be here till Sept. 14 can't wait. I just can't get over how much fun it is to watch a 3D MOVIE!!!"
1,DIGITAL COPY ONLY FOR SONY PSP AND PS3 WHAT A JOKE!!,BUYER BEWARE THIS VERSION OF DIGITAL COPY ONLY WORKS ON A SONY PSP AND PS3 WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT AND WHAT A JOKE! THANKS SONY!!
3,Not for kids...,"I disagree with the reviewer that said this was not for adults & more geared towards kids ... this movie could not hold my son's or my nephews attention at all, they were so bored that they ended up leaving to go play instead of sitting to watch this!The only thing geared towards kids was the graphics & animation ... our kids thought the story was boring & they are not at all interested in watching it again."
1,PSP Only Digital Download... Really?!?,"Only one comment: You can tell that Columbia Pictures is owned by Sony. Though it says in big, bold type across the front of the cover ""BLU-RAY + DVD + DIGITAL COPY"", the only digital copy that is available is for the 17 people who will watch on a PSP instead of the 100 million who want to watch on their iPods or other digital device.Note that you must read the fine print on the back cover before it is pointed out that this is only for PSP. Shame on Columbia Pictures for marketing it this way. Very misleading and dishonest marketing.I can't return my copy, so I'm eBaying it to keep Columbia from getting someone else's money. The only way I can get my money back."
2,Pass on this one...,"With 3D movies hard to come by, I had to try this one. But it is not a very good movie and even worse, it doesn't have very good 3D effects. Monsters vs. Aliens is a way better movie and the 3D effects are much better.."
1,"Mislead by ""digital copy"" language","The movie is cute, and the DVD is fine, but I purchased this for the digital copy. Shame on Sony for the deceptive packaging."
1,sony does it again,so the digital copy is worthless so I feel cheated by sony again. they just don't get it and they are digging their own graves with stupidity like this....
1,NOT DIGITAL COPY,"Great movie, can watch it over and over with my daughter. But like others have said Digital Copy is ONLY for PSP. Completely deceptive. Wish I could return didn't realize it until after return period was over"
4,great entertainment for any age!,"This movie is very well written and one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time and can be enjoyed by everyone in the family, from two years of age right on up to grand parents!"
2,Cheap Interpretation of a Good Story,"The original written story had a humorous creative charm to it but Sony, as it has shown a history of doing, uses the quickest and cheapest studio resources to produce a mass appeal product with plastic and stereotypic characterizations & animations, trite dialogue, and factual ineptitude that will take teachers years to undo in visually impressionable young minds. Really Sony, how much effort is there in presenting the story in a way that actually educates - in some very small way. For example, water always will be water & hydrogen & oxygen - that's it. There's no nitrogen, no genetic material. Anyway, it takes ""work"" for a studio to create a fantasy story that has a magical and, perhaps, believable quality to it. See ""Ponyo"" or any Hayao Miyazaki movie for a comparison."
4,Great movie,"But does not have such many 3d effects, I like it but it could be better. I also think the movies should less expensive."
5,Great movie!,"With all the excellent Pixar movies, and mediocre Dreamworks movies, this was a pleasant change. I personally love the comedy and story. Great movie for all ages."
2,Beware,Good movie but I wish I would of read the reviews here first. The digital copy is for the psp from the ps3 only. I would of never paid that much for the Blu Ray if I knew it was only for the psp. I'm very disappointed and will be returning my copy.
3,Ok 3D movie,"Good movie,very funny!...The 3D is a different story,not as good as i thought it was going to be.Most scene's with the pop out's.. lack the attention you should get out of it,It does make you feel more involed in the movie which,all 3D movies i think should!...so all in all this movie is worth seeing in 3D,but the 2D is just fine as well..I give the movie 5 stars and the 3D 3.5 stars."
5,Great movie!,"We went to this movie expecting it to be okay, but nothing too remarkable. It was fantastic! My husband and I and our three kids (5, 3, 2 years old) absolutely loved it. I never read the book, so I can't say anything about how faithful it is to the book. As its own movie, it's very well done. It's really funny, sweet, and highly quotable. Another plus is that it's even better with repeat viewings (and with our kids, there have been many). For this set specifically, I'm very happy that with so many kids movies, they're selling the combo DVD/Blu-ray. The Blu-ray quality is excellent, but it's a great help to have the DVD as well, as our main TV still has just the DVD player. I wish other movies had this option as well, but it seems to be just kids movies right now."
3,Digital Copy for PSP Only? DISAPPOINTING!,Good movie. Poor execution. Digital copy. Yeah! Only for PSP?!! Why? To sell PSPs? Not going to happen. To sell PS3s (required to transfer to PSP)? Not going to happen. So why? I can't figure this one out. So very disappointing. Just be aware. I wasn't when I placed my pre-order. Oh well.
2,Digital copy code NOT valid for iTunes,"I bought this movie mainly because of the digital copy, thinking I would be able to upload it to my iTunes account. Now that I opened the box and found out the code is valid solely for Sony products, I wish I could return the movie... After all I have paid for the right to have a digital copy. What's the fuss about not letting the code work for iTunes, too?"
3,Sunny with a chance Ba'sketty,"I bought this a present. Great price & arrived earlier that I expected. I had heard alot about the Movie, but was not as great as expressed by friends."
3,eh,"I've seen my share of top-notch CGI films, and some quite bad ones. This falls in the middle. It starts off fairly funny, but I found myself a bit bothered by the character designs, however, the biggest flaw was the fact that the storyline itself felt somewhat rushed and not as well thought-out as it could be. I caught this by chance the other day on TV, and I'm glad I didn't rent it. Some people might like this film and it does have its good parts, but there are many better flicks out there."
5,A Fun Family Film,"This film is just so much fun. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. The kids loved it because of the giant food falling from the sky. I liked it because I found it interesting how this whole thing got started and got out of control. This man just wanted his father to accept him, to understand him, and he never seemed to be able to. He thought that after inventing this fantastic machine, his father would see his worth and would come to understand what made him tick. It was a movie of family relations in my adult eyes, but the kids just loved the silliness of it. I think you will, too!"
5,A Huge hit with my whole family!!!!,"I had absolutely no interest in this movie when it was in theaters however since my 9 year old daughter begged, i rented it the day it came out on dvd. To my surprise we all loved it. As a mother of a 1 year old and a 9 year old i highly recommend this movie, it entertained not only both my children but my husband and myself. We finally bought the movie today and just got finished watching it again. Just as funny the second time around."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,GOOD PRODUCT..NO COMPLAINTS.I WILL BUY MORE FROM THIS RETAILER IF I NEED TO AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT. :)
3,I'll leave color to the professionals,"This didn't work as well as I'd hoped. I have naturally dark blond hair with warm undertones, and my highlights came out a bit brassy. Maybe I didn't leave the solution on quite long enough. Also, the placement of the highlights just aren't up to par with what a stylist would do, but that's my own fault."
2,Don't buy,"I'm sure that writing this book was cathartic for her, but it did little for me. This was not a good purchase."
2,The Cycle Path Review,"This book while interesting, does not really talk about conversion disorder and will have little value to medical or psychiatric practitioners. I have yet to find a good in-depth reasonably priced book on conversion disorder which is really informative and descriptive. This book tells one women's story, but is very very scant in delving into conversion disorder. I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking real information on conversion disorder syndrome. I do however applaud the authors efforts and courage in writing this book."
1,Click. click. click. click. click. click.,"That's all this game is, click the button. You make choices but have no idea what those choices mean or how they affect the game. Then you click.

I just clicked. And clicked. And clicked. And clicked......"
1,Don't really do anything,"These ear plugs block out a very small amount of noise, like the hum of your computer fan or refrigerator. Everything else is still audible. I tried to wear these on the BART (subway of the Bay Area) and it didn't do anything for the noise. I tried to wear them at work and they just emphasized people's talking since it blocks out all the light humming noises in the room.Additionally the plastic is not made to last. After a year or so (even on the set of plugs I didn't use) they started to get this weird stiffness to them, making them even less likely to block out noise because they don't conform to your ear canal. Maybe it's the shape of my ears, but I'm going to have to agree with reviewer amyd - are the positive reviews from people who are hard of hearing? If you like this style of ear plug I recommend the Howard Leight SmartFit. Similar design, re-attachable cord, reusable, actually blocks out noise."
3,"3 pair, no case","The good part is that you get 3 pairs of pretty good earplugs. Typical multi flange construction. Cord is pretty thin. As the other reviews state they don't come with a case, just a little bag. No big deal."
3,they work,"this ear plugs are very confortable but they did not reduce much noice, I was hoping to get more noice reduction."
1,dont work at all :(,"Maybe my ear is too big? but these dont snuggly fit in my ear and have too much of a gap. Therefore, it does not block any sound. I have inserted it into my ear as instructed and tried to change the position with no luck on closing out the sound. I think i will go ahead and buy foam tip instead :("
4,Good.,"These work. They were cheap and convenient. Really have to stick them in your ear pretty deep to get a good seal and that can get uncomfortable after a while, but they work."
2,No better than foam,"Works as well as any cheap foam plug. However, it comes with a warning not to remove too quickly to avoid hurting ear drum. Who needs that?"
2,Does not work,"I purchased this item because it seemed to have decent reviews and it was supposedly the one with the best noise reduction. Honestly, I have in-ear headphones that do a better job of isolating outside noise. These will muffle noise a little bit if you find the sweet spot, but that's about it. I'll be searching for another option."
2,Didn't work for me!,"These ear plugs didn't work for me, instead of reducing noises they...-made my ears hot and itchy-slipped out during the middle of the night-intensified certain sounds like my dog's barkingBut they did work for my boyfriend...he doesn't have any issues with the plugs!So maybe they just aren't right for me!"
5,great!,"these are the best earplugs I have yet to use. Comfortable, and most importantly, STAY IN!! They seem to have the best sound reduction, even more so then the plugs I have that are the max NRR of 32. These are supposedly 6dB less but seem to do a better job, and let me repeat, they stay in!! I would have liked the case they come with, as shown in the picture, but I too just got a cheapie fabric bag. No biggie though. The plugs are worth it, especially for the price, and I don't need a case for them. If you really need a case, they make various small storage containers with screw top and pop top lids you can get at places like walmart, office max, and even sally's beauty. I use them for organization at home, and also to keep styptic powder in."
2,Very uncomfortable,"I do not like foam ear plugs but have to use ear plugs for sleeping. These were similar to ear plugs I had used and really liked, but these are terribly uncomfortable. I couldn't make it through the first night. The edges of the baffles on each ear plug are rough on the ear canal.It was difficult to get a good fit that would shut out the noise."
2,Not Effective,Bought these because my over the ear protection was not working when I fired my 22 rifle. But when people next to me fired their pistols or higher caliber rifles these were not effective at all. I quickly put my over the ear protection back on.
5,Works as Advertised,I use these for auto races (when I am an on-track photographer). They comfortably do exactly what they are supposed to do. When not working a race I use active headphones but these are convenient and work almost as well.
4,"Works well, though case not included.","I work in injection molding and as such am around very loud machines all day. After reading reviews I opted to buy these.When it arrived it didn't come with a hard plastic case but instead included a velour-like small satchel.Despite that disappointment they work very well. I can still hear people talking to me but the low hums of the machines and high pitched grinding noises are reduced.They are very easy to clean, a quick warm water rinse and soft wiping gets them like new. They seem fairly durable,I've been using the same pair almost every day and i haven't seen any tearing in the flanges.The only flaw in the actual product i found was that when unbinding them when you first open them can cause some tearing in the cord themselves. Instead of being coiled inside themselves i would have preferred it come bound with a loose rubber band.You should get them, because i only want to lose my hearing from old age."
1,bad,"This workout consisted of two 30 minute workouts, one step aerobics and the other regular aerobics. The camera work was very bad. I couldn't tell what the arms or legs were doing when the instructor changes moves because I can only see parts of the body. The two ladies in the back couldn't anticipate what the instructor was doing either at times. Bad cueing. I consider myself an intermediate level exerciser and I did not find either workouts challenging."
3,Surprisingly Good!,"I owned this video until it broke. It has two segments: one is a step aerobics workout that steadily builds in exertion. The second one does the same and offers a surprisingly effective, cardiovascular experience. You can do them separately, but I like the full hour and the variety. There are no abs, which would have been great, but I just use another ab workout at the end.Janet L. Parkhurst"
3,A fine album lost in the shuffle,"Jimmy Carl Black was ""the Indian in the group"" who drummed for the Mothers of Invention. When Frank Zappa revamped his lineup Black and fellow Mother ""Bunk"" Gardner split to form this ensemble named after Black's son. (I have heard that the younger Black carried on the name.) The best description is ""progressive"" a la Zappa, but there's down'n'dirty LA rock here as well, plus some surprisingly tuneful stuff from Gardner. It's not entirely consistent - sounds like selections from three or four different bands - and most would consider it an oddity, but would be of interest to Zappa/Mothers fans."
4,Very Well Done,"This Made For TV production could very easily have fallen on its face by attempting to imitate the feature film. Wisely, the director and writers didn't try to recreate Bogart, MacMurray and Ferrar and let the actors create their own Queeg, Keefer and Greenwald. The best scenes are Queeq's cross-examination and the dismantlement of the smug, prissy psychiatrist. This video is well worth your time to watch.NOTE: The quality of picture and sound is not close to DVD standards."
5,Superb Courtroom drama of The Caine Mutiny,All the actors in this courtroom drama version of the Caine Mutiny do a great job. It is sad to realize that Brad Davis is no longer with us. His rendition of CPT Quig is fantastic.I highly recommend this movie.
5,An all-time classic.,"Stan and Ollie are jobless and down on their luck. Before long, their jobs as a maid and butler (Stan forced to dress up in drag) go wrong, and they end up as street-sweepers. After, unwittingly, foiling a bank robbery, they are rewarded by the bank manager with an education. This leads to them going to an Oxford college, where they soon fall foul of student pranks. After Stan is hit on the head by a sliding window, both he and Ollie get an education they weren't expecting.When I first saw this film, around twenty years ago, it was one of my favourite Laurel and Hardy films, and I'd still say that now. This is L&H; at their purest - hilarious situations, great characters and a warmth so lacking in most of today's comedy. In fact I'd say there's never a dull moment in this film, would put it up there with 'Way Out West' as L&H;'s finest."
5,A Chump Fan,"I have waited for a long time for A Chump At Oxford to come out on DVD. It has been one of my most favorite Laurel and Hardy films. I laughed until my sides hurt. My wife who only somewhat likes L & H, thought it was very funny.If you like Laurel and Hardy films and you want a quality DVD, buy this one. Picture and sound were excellent."
3,Laurel and Hardy's Higher Education,"A CHUMP AT OXFORD was one of Laurel and Hardy's last films for producer Hal Roach. Roach was losing interest in the boys by this point (he was occupied by his more ambitious features), so the film isn't top drawer, but there's still plenty to enjoy. A dinner party scene (reworking their silent film FROM SOUP TO NUTS) has Stan and Ollie opposite two favorite foils, Anita Garvin and James Finlayson. Best of all is Stan's transformation into the brilliant, haughty Lord Paddington. Those who have only seen Stan Laurel as the ""Stanley"" character will surely be impressed by this performance. Forrester Harvey is very amusing as Stan and Ollie's valet as is Wilfred Lucas as the Dean. Peter Cushing is highly visible as one of the prankish students. Hopefully, it won't be too long for this film to be restored, remastered and released on videotape."
3,Chump at Oxford pix quality,"The DVD didn't seem to be made from a good quality master. It is not sharp, the black and white is fairly dull and the titles jiggle instead of sitting solidly over the background picture. My VHS copy by comparison is much cleaner and clearer."
4,The Chump's a Champ.,Stan and Ollie are on top form in this hilarious caper. After a brief prologue as butler and maid ( Stan in drag! ) our heroes foil a bank robbery and set off to get an education. Hollywood's Oxford offers a perfect contest for misunderstandings and slapstick. Stan's impression of a plum-in-the-mouth Brit is priceless. A breath of comic fresh air that will have the whole family laughing.
3,Kind of small...,"I wasn't too thrilled with these shoes... they were kind of small and didn't really fit, so I've never actually worn them. They are cute though, and seem well made."
5,Very good product for the price,I bought this builders level to do several small projects including leveling ground for a patio and a swimming pool. The tool worked perfectly for both jobs. I am very satisfied.
3,Good but not as great as they claim,"I have owned mine for about 6 months. I had a Littmann lightweight prior to this one. You can hear a lot more with the Delphi, especially in the back of a loud ambulance. Not as good as the top Littmann Cardiology, but pretty close. Only issue I have had is the diaphram on the back keeps falling off, I finally gave up and work without it now. For the price you really can't complain."
5,A Valuable Teaching Tool,As a teacher of high school seniors and juniors I use this film as part of out Capital Punishment unit. The reason? This film explores all perspectives.
5,Penn And Sarandon In A Classic,"I am a big fan of Shaun Penn- have been since ""Fast Times"", and here he gives the performance of his career as the titled ""Dead Man"". He is a death row inmate, at first shows no sign of remorse. He meets a Nun, played by Susan Sarandon, who I loved since ""Bull Durham"" (the BEST baseball film!) and she shows him that he has a conscience after all.The film teaches a lot about the inhumanity of the Death Penalty and gives us two master performances. This is the best movie!"
2,No big deal,"Because it's about death penalty, nun and savagery, it MUST make you think and it MUST be an intelligent movie ? No way. Both characters are hateful and very badly defined (you don't actually know why the nun fancies Penn so much and vice versa). Since the beginning of the movie, Sarandon's character does nothing but laugh at all that Penn says while crying buckets in front of the victims' parents. The ending is 300% American in its exaggeration."
1,Terrible...I can't believe people love this movie!!,Why a lot more people supporting the criminal side than the victims? Why? The nun's view toward execution makes me feel sicked.This movie appeals sympathy for the criminal who doesn't deserve anything but death.It hurts me that people admire such a movie.
2,capital punishment bad! compassionate nun good! yawn.,"capital punishment bad! compassionate nun good! yawn.furthermore: capital punishment bad! compassionate nun good! yawn.moreover: capital punishment bad! compassionate nun good! yawn.i reiterate: capital punishment bad! compassionate nun good! yawn.and in conclusion: capital punishment bad! compassionate nun good! yawn.respectfully submitted,fletcherp.s. capital punishment bad! compassionate nun good! yawn."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"This movie actually changed my opinion of the Death Penalty. It paints both sides of the story so perfectly and is very good at sending sutile metaphoric messages that deliver powerfully.Extremly thought provoking, poweful movie. END"
5,The Penn is Mightier than the Sword,"""Dead Man Walking"" is Sean Penn at his very best. He should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of convicted murderer, Matthew Poncelet. Susan Sarandon played Sister Prejean perfectly. This movie is sad, shocking, tragic and very informative. But, you don't have to be for or against the death penalty to find this picture riveting and thought-provoking."
5,Dead On,"Buoyed by two memorable performances, Dead Man Walking is the charged narrative of a convicted killer brought to redemption by a selfless nun. It manages to bring to the screen one of the most original polemics on capital punishment ever. Director Tim Robbins gives us an emotionally complex look at the human ugliness on all sides of the issue. Written and acted with a rare honesty, Dead Man Walking challenges our all-consuming desire for revenge in the face of savagery.The genius of Dead Man Walking is how it humanizes those we deem monsters yet completely condemns the acts of violence that got them there. For this reason this alone it's bound to raise the ire of some; it's far more easy to see a murderer as alien rather admit our own culpability in his creation."
4,Dead Man Walking,"In my opinion Tim Robbins succeeded in making a realistic film. The fact that it is based on the book by the real Sister Helen avoids that it seems to be pure invention. Futhermore Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn did a very good job because thy did not seem to play a role, but to be the characters. They managed to create an intimacy although they have no physical contact. What I also liked about the film is that it does not influence the watcher in his/her attitude towards capital punishment. It just shows both sides so that the watcher can form an own judgement about the subject.The only thing that I disliked was the beginnig of the execution scene when Matt is to symbolize Jesus Christ. You cannot compare a cruel rapist and murderer to the most unselfish man there ever was!But all in all it is a good film that makes you think about your own attitude towards death penalty."
1,A TRUE LOSS OF FAITH.,"Faith Hathaway had just graduated High School and was one week away from going into the army. She was full of hope and life. Robert Willie( the man this movie was based on), along with his accomplice raped and murdered her. She was raped, stabbed 17 times, and raped after she died. The director of this movie denied requests made by Faith's mother, and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die. Where was the mercy for Faith? Where was the compassion for Faith? Where were the people protesting for Faith's life? Finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to Faith? What about her suffering and that of her family? Barely a foot note in this movie. Ohh and Sister Prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case."
5,Worth the Money,"My old Siemons pouch was getting to the end of its life so it was time to upgrade. Now I can carry my snips, punch-down, multi-bit screwdriver, and flush cutters in a single holster. I've been eyeing this holster for years while I was a cable tech but now that I'm a Sys Admin I don't do much cabling anymore. For times when I do though, this thing rocks!"
1,...hasn't this been tried before??,"So I ended up with this book because of work, and while I'm reading it I keep thinking 'Where have I heard about this before??'. Then it hits me: ENRON!! They used this same system of incentives, reviews, and bonuses as what is detailed in this book. The end result for Enron was it destroyed the company.So, I definately disagree with a lot of what's in this book, but the bigger problem is what ISN'T in the book - namely the costs. Any plan has costs and benefits and in the end you have the weigh those costs and benefits to decide if you want to use the plan. But, Stiffler treats his ""Action Plans"" as if there are no real costs. It's typical salespitch clap-trap. What about employee turnover (a major expense for almost any business), or damage to employee morale and teamwork (difficult to quantify but very important to most businesses)?I'd have to say that the cost of this kind of ""Performance"" is way too high for the very small benefits it might offer."
4,Toddler with Developmental delays,"My daughter is 3 and has severe developmental delays. We bought two of these, one for home and one for school. She is doing VERY well and loves to use this cup! Its nice that is is see semi see through so we can help her to see when the liquid is being drank or not!"
4,A very emotional account of Hill's achievements,"As a huge fan of Lauryn Hill, I thought I already knew a lot about her. Still, Chris Nickson provides extra substantial information for everyone interested in the young artist. Without having had the chance to speak to Hill personally and engage her in discussions, he manages to give a gripping account of her career achievements by solely drawing his material from previous articles about her. The result is quite appaling, and, luckily, he leaves speculations out. This is not a huge biography,but it's an emotional report of someone who clearly adores Hill and wanted to write about her as soon as possible."
2,Absolutely wonderful,"I love Lauryn Hill,but this book doesn't tell her whole life story and everything you wanted to know about this influential, aspiring, great musician."
2,Practical Balancing Book Review,I was disappointed with the contents of the book. Many of the topics could have used more technical discussion. There are many repeat Figures throughout the book and a lot of unnecessary discussion for an engineering book. If you want a general review of balancing this is a fine book but if you are looking for more in-depth technical content look elsewhere.
2,Poor substitution,"I've ordered from Proflower before with good results. This order arrived with 16 yellow tulips and 16 blue irises in a clear vase, nothing like the written description or photo. To Proflower's credit, they did promptly refund my purchase price for the mistake."
4,As Long As the Guitar Plays,"Great guitar tab as well as piano and vocal. NOT dumbed down piano with chord boxes, but full score. Very nice!"
1,Song Mixup: beware,I downloaded The Garden Of Eden by Joe Valino and Darling You Sent Me by Sam Cooke was downloaded instead. At least one other song (one by the Ames Bros.) was also mixed up with a Sam Cooke number. Avoid this mp3 listing.
4,The elusive review.,"Being a Resnik fan, I take pride in my specially numbered edition! Including short stories; some old, some new, as well as a journal of his trip to Africa,this is a must have for any loyal reader."
4,Connections,"This book is very useful. Didn't like the cover or the format much (it felt like it needed to be a different shape/size) but the content is like gold. Glen Carpenter has a solid grasp on the biblical meanings of symbols, and clearly explains the significance of these types & symbols. And on top of that, parts of it are just a good read."
5,excellent level,"This is an excellent product - it far exceeded my expectations for accuracy and ease of use. It has excellent optics and is ruggedly built. I have used it for grading drainage lines as well as for getting walls level. I would have liked the included rod to be a bit longer, and it would be nice to have a horizontal angle vernier, but overall it is an excellent product."
3,DEWALT DW096PK 26X Auto Level Kit,"Works OK, but does not ""auto level""; manual levelling using an air bubble should not be advertised as auto level!"
3,Cooler Bag Review,Wasn't configured the way I would have liked. Needs a little less height and a little more length.
5,great case,This case fits great. good snug fit. the two piece design is awesome. better than any i have tried or have seen before. definitely worth the $. very unassuming cover. not flashy at all or by any means an eye sore. nice product.
5,Great Case!,"Veeeerrrrryyyyy sturdy case. This case actually looks better with the phone iside it that it does in the picture. Doesn't have that whimpy top flap that keeps coming off when you're on a call either...and since the top flap has a longer inside cover, it also acts as a screen protector for the phone's large display screen. Much better than the leather OEM case I had (which broke)."
5,Classic early L&H,"For those of you who love the origin history of L&H, this is a gem. Though the L&H team we all know hasn't come together at the time of Sailors Beware, we can see the immense talents of our stars. Hardy is the big bully over Laurel but hasn't aquired the lovable & soft manner yet. Laurel is the same doofus underdog and lovable. We can see his great comedic talent in the card game with the kid developing. Of course one of my very favorite L&H side characters, Anita Garvin, almost steals the show in one of her best performances. It didn't hurt that she was also so young and beautiful. Of course Laurel comes out on top & Hardy is frustrated again. It is a great silent. The best of their careers was to come."
2,Not all that good.....,"i dont see how anybody could say this is a ""classic"" lol ...this album has excellent production, Marley Marl dropped some excellent beats....but KRS didnt deliver! im a huge hip hop fan and jam REAL HIP HOP so i know what im talking about...KRS One surprised me with basic flow and lyricism that reaches a level of mediocrity...sure it's real hip hop but this cd was a huge disappointment....Nas' Hip Hop Is Dead is a million times better than this basic rap....KRS One is a pioneer of rap no doubt, but this cd was anything but classic...."
5,best album since late 90,"one of the best hip-hop albums since late 90 i would say..real,raw with a message...kill current ""trendy hip-hop"" production...recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Delightful!,"What a delightful little book! I am stepmom to a 6 year old girl, whom I adore. She and I are very close, and although things aren't perfect we have a very strong relationship. I hope that will always be the case.There are many things that can go wrong in stepfamilies, but this book is a lovely little reminder of how right things can sometimes go too. It is an affirmation that though we may experience hurt and challenges, it is possible to overcome and produce positive relationships.The book is broken into the following sections:Discover--Learning as We GoDeepening--Facing the Challenges of Life TogetherDaring--Creating New Ways of Being FamilyDelight--Gathering the Gifts of Life TogetherSharing our Own Wisdom--Advice to Steps and Soon-to-Be StepsI enjoyed reading the stories of other stepmoms and stepdaughters scattered throughout, and I thought each chapter had some very useful ""nuggets"". I definitely recommend this book!"
5,Quick Read! Great Perspective!,"This book gave me great perspective to all of the different ""step"" situations out there. After reading this book I have come to the conclusion that I am going to make a great step mother and the relationship between my future step daughter and myself is wonderful and we are heading down an amazing path together.This book gave me great insight into how much of a difference a step mother can make, not only in our step children's lives but also in our husbands, our husband's ex wife's, and our own children's lives.I would recommend this book for a quick memior read or to someone who is entering into a step situation, whether it be a step mother or step daughter!"
1,Unrealistic,"This was absolutely the worst book I have read about step-parenting. I have been a step-parent for 30 years. The rosy, lovey descriptions in this book are in no way accurate in my own circumstances and many others I know that are step-parents. It does not truly address the step-mother that is raising her step-daughter right along side her own daughter of same age. Fathers do get custody. Bio-mothers do abandon their children. Step-mothers do have to discipline their step-children. There are many absolutely horrendous times with screaming fits and defiance. There seems to come a time when the step-child marries and has her own family that things improve and the step-mother is appreciated. But don't let your guard down, abandonment and divorce issues never go away completely. They still have issues as adults and who do you think they blame ~ dad and step-mother. I would not recommend this book."
4,All's fine except bracelet clasp,"The watch is just as described and just what I wanted. I like the weight and size. The bracelet, however, does not have the safety clasp as advertised so,as the clasp wears, I expect that it will pop open. I've had this problem with anther Seiko bracelet without the safety."
4,nice looking,"My husbands Christmas gift. He has a hard time seeing numbers, but this seems to be working really well for him."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this for my dad as a birthday gift and he loves it! It's very good quality for the price, looks nice and does its job. Excellent buy!"
3,"Looks Great, However....","I have had my watch but a short time. Although it looks great, and keeps very good time, the band and watch stem are another story. The stem is unshielded and invites attaching itself to articles of clothing. The bracelet material is very light weight, and appears to be made out of some sub-standard stamped metal. The bracelet edges are unfinished, are sharp, and the edges and corners seem to catch on everything."
5,More accurate than Rolex,"Surprisingly the most prestigious and expensive watches, such as Rolex, are generally not the most accurate. Rolex certified chronometers (which are finely-crafted mechanical watches costing $1,000 or more) are guaranteed by Rolex to be accurate to within two minutes (120 seconds) per month. Seiko guarantees its quartz watches to be accurate to within 15 seconds per month, which is eight times more accurate than Rolex's prestigious -- and expensive -- chronometers. Seiko's guaranteed accuracy is conservative because my Seiko quartz watches are accurate to within 4 to 5 seconds per month. Rolex does make highly-accurate quartz watches which they call their Cellini series, but this series is less popular than their less-accurate mechanical chronometers. If you are looking for a good-looking man's watch that is highly dependable and more accurate than a Rolex -- and also far less expensive -- this Seiko should fit the bill."
3,Looks cheap in person - but sturdy?,"I bought this watch as a gift for my husband. When I pulled it out of it's packaging I have to say that I was disappointed. I thought it looked cheap - especially for the brand and price. However my husband claims to love it. He was impressed with the way the links are connected on the band. He always adjusts his own watches and says he feels confident that this band will not break. (My husband is infamous for breaking his watches.) So overall; it doesn't look bad, but not what I'd expect visually from Seiko. But the man wearing it, loves it."
1,listed in wrong catagory,This is a mechanical watch. It was listed under atomic watches. Be careful. Read everything. You want to make sure you get what is desired.
4,Senna racing class,"It's a racing guide, not a biography. The F1 world through the great brazilian winner. It's a basic racing guide, with F1 how-to drive information, signed by Ayrton Senna. Perhaps a hardbook edition will be a perfect option."
4,Simplely the best.,"Great book that F1 mania must have one. In this book, just simple and easy instructions, but very useful to race driving. This must be a bible for race driving."
1,Very basic,"A very basic introduction to race driving, although it briefly covers the topics there is a lack of depth in each short chapter.There are better books around on the technical, preparation, and psychological aspects of race driving.Given the superb skills Senna had its a real disappointment."
3,not bad,"this is not bad, although senna DID hold back a lot. what is truly bizzare is that some sections, particularly on various apex selection, read like the book by.... PROST!!! oh, the irony...also, i paid $140: this is not because what senna wrote is worth this much (it is emphatically not, all carrol smith ""to win"" books have more useable info about DRIVING), but because of the obvious history."
5,Good size,"This is a little bigger than our old mailbox but it holds a lot-like magazines and bags of mailed prescriptions. The only problem I have is the top doesn't stay up so you need to use 2 hands to get the mail. I just wasn't used to that with my 28 year old mailbox, but you get used to it."
1,If you want to learn Kanji - Try something else,"The book starts out ok. It shows you the characters for 1-10 then the book goes down hill from there. Complex characters are thrown at you with no real means of remembering them. Overall the book is not very funny either. If you really want to learn Kanji, spend your money elsewhere."
5,A bizzare film from the Coen brothers,"Fargo is the most bizzare film I have ever seen. This is one of the few films I have seen that works wonderfully as a comedy and a film noir. The characters are colorful,and all funny in one way or another. If you love the offbeat you should buy this film in a heart beat."
5,You betcha,"Still my favorite Coen Bros. movie. The music by Carter Burwell is wonderful, the Rodger Deakins photography is beautiful, and the writing and directing by the Coens is sharp, sardonic, and engrossing. Frances McDormand plays a great cop and the whole cast is fun to watch. This is one of the great American dark comedies from 2 guys who really know how to do dark comedy. If you like humorous, bleak and snowy tales of twisted kidnappings gone wrong in desolate Midwestern winterscapes then this is the movie for you."
2,Overrated,"This film is interesting but ultimately adds up to nothing. There's nothing ""intellectual"" or sophisticated about it; it's just a basic murder mystery without much mystery trying to blend elements of dark comedy without much humor. Despite some good performances (especially William H. Macy), the dialogue is downright moronic at times and the plot has no real suspense. There might have been some suspense built around about whether the wife will survive, but the filmmakers chose to almost completely ignore it, making her death a side-note in a conversation later in the film. Poor sense of drama. The filmmakers seem to be playing the joke on us. I wasn't laughing."
2,a surprising and aggravating bore,"With all the hooplah about this film, you may be surprised to discover how mannered, self-conscious and even mean-spirited it is. Cute dolts bundled up to look like Michelin men in the midwest solve a murder mystery amid miles and miles and more miles of snow. The audience is invited to laugh at working class people and feel superior, while at the same feeling a cozy nostalgia for American homespun values, represented by an ambitious but pregnant cop and her toy teddy bear husband. Yuck! As usual, the Coen Brothers think making their actors expressionless is artsy, but somehow William H. Macy springs the trap and goes his own way. He gives a marvelous performance (although he gives a better one in ""Boogie Nights"") so he rates a star. The other star goes to the two terrifying murderers (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) who, by being simply terrifying, manage at times to get the blood flowing in this otherwise overly precious, cold-hearted and negligible film."
3,A Story as Banal as Its Characters,"The story and characters in this film are frankly too bland and boring for this film to be of any interest. Too many screen writers these days seek to advance the vulgar as the object of high quality cinema: unfortunate.Please Hollywood, spare us from watching over-advertised films covering the monotonous lives of average yokels living in the middle of nowhere with an IQ lower than 80; I've watched more interesting lives play out on ""Cops"" for free thank you. A movie on the lives of brainless middle-class nobodies who no one would bother remembering but for this mediocre film. The good sheriff saves the day story is getting old; especially when it's about someone whose personality is as broad and flat as a dime. And what is it with the retarded language?! Sesame Street has more stimulating conversations than the moronic dialogues in this film. Is this film a real sleeper? Oh you betcha! It's kind of funny lookin'! Non-educated!"
2,Fargo,"A story about dim-witted criminals and the cop pursuing them through Minnesota in the dead of winter. That's the gist of the entire story. It was only ""OK"" in my book. Not a movie I will watch weekly, but good enough to watch again, someday."
1,:(,"I heard this was a funny movie, but we didn't watch it because of the bad language in the beginning."
1,Fargo,"All I can say is: that is 98 minutes of my life that I will NEVER get back. It would have been more productive and exciting to watch my toenails grow. I love Steve Buscemi and Bruce Campbell, but what were they thinking???"
1,This movie sucks,"Whenever my family and I see a bad movie, we always say, ""Is it FARGO bad?"" If this movie is worse than Fargo, we know it sucks. Fargo has set the new ""low standard"" for my film watching. I appreciate great movies, comedies, dramas, artistic films, etc. I honestly couldn't find one redeeming quality in this whole film. Actually, the best part was when it ended and I could stop watching it."
1,Gangster Satire!?,"An interesting (and sadly true) story has been ripped apart by the screenwriters and the director. The plot is simple, predictable without any twists and turns. The people described in the movie are dumb and uninspired and actually the smartest person in the movie is the one with the least dialog. Some scenes do not make any sense and do not integrate into the storyline at all, like the police officers Asian friend or the Indian mechanic. The acting is superficial, uninsprired and predictable. The story would have a lot of potential, if the director would have been more clear about his intentions. I felt sad to read in the beginning that the plot is based upon a true story and that has been recreated as accurately as possible and expected a drama or thriller. Maybe real crime is not as exciting in real life as it it in fiction. What ever happend to the kidnapped wife? I couldn't wait to get it out of the DVD player."
1,A bad movie,"Even without the hype of Fargo, I thought this was a really bad movie.If you can tell me why so many people gave this movie 5 stars, i would love to know,"
1,movies i am sorry i saw,"ya i know it got awards but this is the most horrible, sick, boring, etc etc, movie i have ever seen . real waste of time. if stupid and throwing someone in a shredder is your idea of comedy than be my guest and the dialogue and phony swedish accents is like nails on a chalk board."
5,This one makes my top 10 list!,"Wow what a movie! Fargo is a strange movie but is extremely interesting. How it was done & just the dark humor in it was what amazed me the most about it. I loved all the actors! After seeing this movie, Steve Buscemi became 1 of my favorite actors! He's brialliant! I already thought he was cool but this movie just made him even cooler. I loved the creative performance of Francis McDormand as the pregnant police lady! She was brilliant & was just there! The part was hers. William H. Macy is great too. Everyone in this movie was great & the twisted plot made it so outstanding. The humor is very dark but somewhat understandable why it's funny. I can go on forever about this movie. It makes my top 10 list, easy."
4,Murder with Humor,"Pretty simple story line about a murder plot. However what makes this film so different from your typical murder mystery films are the actors/actresses. You have a pregnant cop who is out examining dead bodies after the fact her husband makes her breakfast in the morning. You have Steve Buscemi who does a remarkable job adding eerieness, comedy, and empathy. Finally Macy (used car dealer guy) does a fine job with that MINNESOTA ACCENT as well as being a typical middle class suburban used car dealer who seems like everyone in life is trying to screw him over. He makes me feel so bad for him in this movie....I hate it. He convinces me that his life is miserable and he has every right and reason to have people kill his wife, etc....Overall this movie is funny,mysterious,unpredictable,and the ending is rather grim."
4,unusual,"Fargo manages to take very dark subject matter, make it humourous at times, all the while maintaining a sense of realism. The characters are really what make this movie; they are quirky and entertaining. Great acting; William H. Macy stands out. A definite departure from the ordinary, highly recommended."
3,Where's the rest?,Fargo is one of my all-time favorite movies. I was thrilled when this director's cut came out since a DVD wasn't available. I was very disappointed when I discovered that they cut the movie considerably. Scenes that were just so great were completely absent. Aren't director's cuts supposed to be more inclusive? Waah!
3,Yyyeah,"It's a good movie that you won't hate yourself for watching, but it is kind of weird and oddly paced."
2,Why was this movie nominated for a BEST PICTURE award?,"The appeal of this film is totally lost on me! True, the performances were well done, and a lot of talented people obviously worked on this picture... still, the story itself was AWFUL! Why was this story even written? Maybe I'm wrong to see movies for entertainment purposes, but if you're looking for an enjoyable film, THIS ISN'T IT!!!"
4,A 90s classic,"""Fargo,"" is the tale of a kidnapping scheme gone horrribly wrong. It is filled with great performances by its actors, and features an engaging script. Thogh Mcdormand deserved her Oscar for this role, it was William H. Macy who stole the show, with a superb performance as a car salesman who hires criminals to kidnap his own wife. A film which can move from hilarity to horror in a matter of minutes. In addition to the wonderful script, it features some of the most inventing sequences seen in a while, most notably putting someone in a wood chipper. ""Fargo,' is a fun movie to watch, with a great script and performances."
3,"A unique, entertaining film which stumbled onto the AFI 100","FARGO is an entertaining, humorous movie the likes of which I have not seen much in the past. It was short (at 98 minutes) yet managed to develop its characters very well, and the plot line was extremely interesting to say the least. The acting was quite good and, although the pregnant sheriff began to grate on me after a while, the role was performed exacxtly as planned--an Oscar-worthy performance for sure. What mystifies me is how a this film--as unique and entertaining as it is--somehow managed to stumble onto the AFI's Top 100 movies of all time list. This film definitely belongs in the Top 50 movies that I have seen, but the Top 100 of all time? Maybe the American Film Institute (and the Academy, for that matter, who nominated FARGO for best picture in 1996) see something more meaningful, symbolic, and timeless about a person being put thorugh a wood chipper than do I."
3,What's the big fuss?,"I heard talk of Fargo's brilliance for years. When I finally found an opportunity to watch it, I was expecting a lot. TheElectra Glide in Blue-like opening of a car materializing from out of the distance, set to orchestral music (""Fargo, North Dakota""), sated my expectations. Sadly, I was to go hungry from then on.I have no complaints with the individual acting, the possible exception being Frances McDormand's camp performance. On the other hand, William H. Macy deserved the Oscar that year, even over Cuba Gooding Jr. But as a complete piece, I found Fargo lacking, even after a second viewing. I suppose the weak story bugs me most. The film may have been shocking when it was first released, but it has not aged well. Have we become so jaded since 1996 that the woodchipper scene is already passé? At least this was dropped from the AFI 100 (Revised, 2007)."
3,Not as good as I expected,"First off, let me say that I love movies and different/quirky films. I never caught this when it was originally released, but had heard much about it, so I finally watched a copy I recently purchased as a blind-buy.While this one has its appeal for me, in the setting, the off-beat characters and the domino effect, of the plot itself, I must be honest in stating that I felt like I was watching a ""B"" movie-not a critically acclaimed one. Visually, you could feel the coldness and the monotony of this film, and the ""every-day"" characters worked for me. There are several scenes that are memorable such as the guy being shot in the face (just kinda funny), wood chopper scene, and the discussion with the guy shoveling the snow outside. Other than that, for me, it could have been a movie on USA. I love the actors in the film, and the script (well written to convey the overall confusion and ""realness"" of the characters), but it was not as ground breaking, as I thought it would be."
5,my very favorite movie,"I love this movie and everytime I watch it I laugh out loud. Yes, Frances McDormond is the heart and soul of the movie but William H. Macy is absolutely marvelous as the not so nice ""nice guy"". I could watch him in Fargo every day. Steve Buscemi is also wonderful. The scene where he's driving to Minniapolis and tells his partner in crime that ""two can play this game"" (of not talking) and then can't shut up is just hilarious. Everyone one is right on the mark. I find that I often don't enjoy Coen movies as much the first watch as I do in subsequent viewings but that works out just fine because they get better every time I watch them and I never tire of them. By the way, why do people think that in order to review a movie they have to give the whole story away? Some of these reviews remind me of book reports from high school. Amazon needs to start putting spoiler warnings on many of them."
3,I'm a Minnesotan and the accents are so over the top,"my title says it all - I'm about halfway through watching this movie, and I'm totally disgusted with the over-the-top MN accents. Those who don't live here probably think this is the way all of us talk. Not!!! And, oh yeah, just because we live in MN doesn't automatically make us dumb. Truly overkill on the stereotyping."
3,?,"I gave Fargo three stars because I enjoyed most of it. It was funny, and witty. Frances McDormand did a good job, as did Steve Buscemi and William H. Macy. I would have given it more stars, but then the end happened. I thought that it was a pretty stupid and abrupt ending that took away from the movie. All that it left me saying was ""what???"" Anyway, this was not at all something that a family could enjoy together. Its R rating reflects strong violence, pervasive strong language and some sexual situations. Some said that this movie was a total spoof, but even with that knowledge, the end ruined it. The first 96 minutes were great. The last 2 took away from it!"
1,Very Disappointed,"This was the worst movie I've ever seen!!! Every other word in this film was a cuss word. The murders were extremely brutal and graphic. There wasn't much of a plot and it was extremely boring. It depicts all the people from Minnesota as weird. The worst part was, I ordered a book off of a Christian category and this movie popped up as being recommended. There was absolutely no correlation between the two. My husband and I watched it one night while our children were gone. Thank goodness. We would have turned it off if they had been watching. I will be throwing this movie away. I wouldn't even give it to anyone."
1,Yah! Yah! Yah,"Yes, they do say ""Yah"" in Minnesota - but not every other word. And Yah is not the only word which is vastly overdone. It would violate Amazon's review guidelines to repeat it here. Despite some reputation as a comedy, I found nothing to evoke even a chuckle. It is an excessively violent, bloody film. The financial difficulties which lead a pathetic car salesman to instigate this reign of terror are never explained, making for an implausible plot. DON'T BOTHER!"
1,hated it,I couldn't stand their accents. I am saddened by the fact that this was based on a true story.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE....,"...if you are expecting, as I was, a movie that can live up to another Coen Bros. movie, such as The Big Lebowski. I rented Fargo under the assumption that it would be as funny and satiracal as The Big Lebowski, but what I found was a tragic tale of misfortune with some comedy thrown in.I laughed outloud at this movie maybe twice. In all, a total of six people died, and not even in comical fashion. The only thing good I can think to say about Fargo is that the characters did an amazing acting job, and I think this movie could have been alot better if the Coens would have used similar elements as those of their other films.Overall, I would advise the average comedy moviegoer to steer clear of this picture, unless you're really into drama or are currently taking antidepressant medication."
4,Violent and Disturbing,"It is funny in a macabre way, but if you are squeamish about realistically depicted cold blooded murder, as I evidently am, don't watch this disturbing film. The film is accurate in showing upper midwest people acting in a matter of fact way about awful, unbelievably evil (and stupid) people.Only saving grace is it shows that there really are essentially evil people in the world."
4,A bloody laugh-riot...,"In the history of Hollywood, there few movies harder to gauge than Fargo. Yes, it's a comedy, but at times you feel guilty about laughing so hard because of all of the on-screen carnage. Joel and Ethan Coen's nightmarish telling of a kidnapping which goes horribly awry leaves little to the imagination, showing virtually every gory and violent detail. However, along the way you begin to learn a lot about the characters you're watching, and you even start to care about some of them. You also find yourself chuckling at things you wouldn't think are funny -- violence, pregnancy and legs sticking out of wood-chippers, to name a few.While I would not rate this up with Raising Arizona, this certainly does rank among the best films the Coens have made to date. And with top-flight performances by Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi, it's more than worth watching. If you're a Coen fan, this is a must-add to your collection."
2,Gratuitous violence overshadows some great potential,"I tried to view this highly recommended film with an open mind. I was told ""the accents are great"", ""the acting is wonderful"", ""you are transported right to Minnesota"". I tried to go along with the crowd. I really did. But you know what, enough is enough. The novelty is gone just about the time the first close-range bullet splatters the first brain. This could have been an interesting, satirical movie. Instead it was mind-numbing and violent. It was for the pulp fiction crowd. Perhaps blowing someone's head off, or shooting them in the back is entertaining. I missed that point. McDormand and Macy give great performances, likable and disturbing, but please...leave something for our imaginations. Make it thoughtful. The number of times I have heard someone ask me ""but wasn't the woodchipper funny"" makes me think about a lot of individuals trying to justify something. Stand up for yourselves, go see a good movie."
2,You don't foget this one.,"This has to be the strangest movie I have ever seen. I went to see it with my 17 year old son. We were both shell-shocked when it was over but we have remembered more about that movie after one viewing than probably any other movie we have watched. To say it is Good leaves you open to much speculation, but it certainly is interesting and I will watch it again."
3,Dissapointing,"I keep hearing such wonderful things about this film. How original and quirky it is; how funny it is, etc. However, those people failed to mention that there is also a lack of plot. We get just a glimpse of the plot, that was truly never really resolved and had no beginning. Not to say that there aren't plenty of films like that. But Fargo wasn't doing anything for me. There was nothing shocking, or gruesome, or innovative about this film. And those accents were overdone. From what I hear, people really do talk like that in those parts. But it FELT overdone in the film to the point of annoying.I am giving this 3 stars because of the acting, accents aside. William H. Macy is a true genius of an actor, no matter what role he plays. Steve Buscemi is in a class of his own and Frances McDormand is always spot on. They really made the most of the lacking script. I won't go so far as to call this film boring, but it certainly wasn't riveting."
2,"Over-rated movie, disappointing DVD","Definately worth watching when it comes on TV, but not worth owning by any stretch. Subjective reviews of the movie aside, the DVD has poor quality encoding and lacks any bonus material other than the trailer.The acting is great, though the accents are overdone. There are random plot diversions that never contribute (filler?), no great police work, no suspense...The Oscar winning lead's role is well done, and the character is loveable, but this definately isn't one of the best 100 movies of the century..."
4,"The fox, the wolves and the rabbit.","Joel and Ethan Coen are two brothers making films together, whom I think the world of since I entered a movie theatre a far off Easter day, and they started letting kill as so many characters as it rained blood --truth to tell tomato sauce. Are they obliged by the sign of the times? In fact Coens have filmed the true fiction or fictive truth ""Fargo"", telling us how men are really able to turn into beasts for a bag of money. But no huge snowdrift will ever cover their crimes, whenever a pregnant fox --the cop-- is following the printfoots of some ruthless wolves --two low-lifes. Crimson tracks in the snow take her right into the rabbit hole --the car dealer. So the catching fox will be rewarded by getting back home as actual pussycat likes better to catch the Zs. (As from the Global Zoo Web article on Sep. 04, 00)"
5,"gentle, intelligent and funny","These guys pulled off the impossible. They made a film that is simultaneously gentle, intelligent and funny. I've watched it a dozen times and loved it each time."
5,Everything PULP FICTION isn't.,"FARGO succeeds much more at being darkly comic than PULP FICTION. It's a complicated comedy of errors, a suspense movie, a thriller, a drama, everything. Nothing is lacking in this movie, and it's not overlong, either, clocking in at about 97 minutes. Fun, funny, and a satisfying movie experience overall."
5,A real life movie of a Minnesota murder spree.,"Saying this movie is good is an understatment this movie is UNBELIEVABLE. Joel and Ethan Coen showed their true dark selves through actors W.H. Macy, Frances McDormand (who one an Oscar for her performance as a pregnant cop, Margie)and Peter Stormare. The Coen brothers one up them selves as they stay in their true dark comedy selves. Casting in this movie was great."
5,Great movie!,"Had to add this movie to my library. Great acting and plot. Francis McDormand is wonderful and unexpected as the Sheriff. William H. Macy is a train wreck. Will enjoy it over and over again,"
3,Love this movie,When I first heard about this movie I was a bit skeptical. I heard funny stories from others that had really enjoyed and they had joked about people loking for the buried money. After watching it twice I love it. I would recommend it to anyone who is familiar with the Cohen's work.mi think it fits in quite nicely with the theme of their movies.
4,"Mesmerizing, Original Film","FARGO is simply a great film, unique and beautifully produced. Everything works, especially the leading performances by Buscemi, Macy and MacDormand. You'll laugh, you'll be appalled...still, you will always be transfixed. The Coen brothers did a great job with this one.The DVD Edition is loaded with bonus features that, unless you are a mega-Fargo fan, fail to excite. Especially disappointing is a rather dull Charlie Rose interview...I'm surprised more DVD makers don't load up their menues with this kind of cheap, easy-to-obtain content.Still, definitely one for your film library, you bet'cha."
2,It is not their best.,"Okay, I never thought I would be one of those people who didn't ""get"" a critically acclaimed movie, but there is a first for everything I guess. Fargo was good. It was entertaining, not particularly funny, but good. If I didn't know about all the hype surrounding it, I would probably give it 3 stars out of 4. Roger Ebert called this one of the best movies he has ever SEEN? Now THAT I don't understand. And you can't say that I just don't ""get"" Coen brothers movies, because I thought Raising Arizona was brilliant. I just didn't see that in here. Oh well. As for the DVD itself, I was extremely disappointed. For such a revered movie, it had absolutely no bonus material whatsoever. It had the trailer, and that is about it. A complete waste. So I give the movie 3 out of 4 stars, and the DVD 2 out of 5."
3,what was the hype all about ?,wow... what was the hype all about ? i just saw this movie after reading all the reviews about how great this movie was... what's wrong with y'all ?the movie was boring at times and it was nothing special. maybe i shoudda seen it in 1996 when it came out. i guess it's too old in 2011
3,lacking,"in my mind, this movie was actually pretty boring. when many people called it the best thriller of the year I went out and rented it....and found my self bored even before the lackluster ending. dont get me wrong, the acting by all most all of the cast was excellent, its just that the movie is pretty annoying and the fact that the townspeople say 'ja' atleast 5 times in every sentence can start grinding you nerves.the story isnt really anything special...guy pays 2 guys to kidnapp his wife, guys screw up and [destroy] a few people.... the movie is short and there are no suspensful moments in the entire movie."
1,Possibly the Most Overrated Film in American History,"That the AFI put this miserable roll of film in the top 100 says more about the AFI than anything. This movie is quite possibly the worst movie that's ever been made outside of Ed Wood. NOTHING in this movie deserves merit. The mean-spirited scenes involving people of North Dakota and the subtle attacks on Asian-Americans is quite evident. I truly wish the Coens would realize one thing: It's great to have relatives in the business, but that does not make one an artist or a filmmaker."
1,NOT THE WAY IT IS UP HERE,BEING FROM MINNESOTA I WAS OFFENDED BY THE WAY MINNESOTANS WERE PORTRAYED. FIRST OF ALL SINCE WHEN IS FARGO IN MINNESOTA. SECONDLY THERE IS NO INTERSTATE RUNNING BY BRAINARD AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE WAY THAT THE ACTORS WERE SPEAKING IS ABOUT 1% OF THE POPULATION OF MINNESOTA'S ACCENT.THIS MOVIE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESEARCHED ALOT BETTER BEFORE THEY MADE IT. THIS MOVIE IS DOWN THERE WITH THE SNAILS AND MUD.
1,TOO STRANGE FOR ME.,"VERY WEIRD MOVIE, NO BASIC PLOT, I DON'T KNOW HOW THE AFI RANKED IT IN THE TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL TIME."
3,It should be 5 stars but the missing scene(s) give it a 3,"Fargo was a very enjoyable film. You may have to see it a few times to fully catch it all. And thats were the problem is. The DVD version has one missing scene in which the wife is murdered by the kidnapers, why was this scene deleted? I think there were a few other minor changes; but this one missing scene makes me question the company that is responsible for the faithful transfer of films in theater to films on DVD! Overall if you can't have it the original way; this is a very enjoyable movie."
2,"""Fargo"" tries to parody the upper-midwest but fails.","""Fargo"" may have an interesting plot, but anyone from the upper-midwest is too distracted by the poorly done accents and satire to notice."
4,just great!,"this is an awesome film that you can't never forget! even if you don't like coen bro's film,you can't off your eyes from the video.william macy's doing great, also carter burwell's music is excellant!"
3,Rough with splashes of brilliance,"Anyone who knows the work of the Coen brothers knows how talented they are as writers, directors, and filmmakers in general. In ""Fargo"" we begin to see some of this talent in the brilliant acting performances given. However, the plot is unremarkable, and the context of the story is deprived, making the film as a whole ultimately pointless. We have no reason to watch these horrific murders, and the Coen brothers realize this, and introduce the film with a fictitious backstory, claiming it is based on true events. You are better served by watching any of their other films after this point."
2,not all i expected,"i dont understand what all the fuss was about, it didn't satisfy me as much as the critics said that it would!"
4,Fargo - The Movie,"I was a latecomer to this movie, but late or not, the movie, though a little aged by 2008, is still a great action-drama. I finally purchased this movie for my partner, it being in her all-time top 20, though perhaps not in mine."
1,"Realism, if you want it.","Once again we have a degraded piece of crap so unredeemingly sick and twisted that the human thing to do is to try to invent a 'reason' for it. This movie depicts a bunch of criminals who botch a kidnapping scheme and then try to cover it up in the dumbest way possible. Yes, the actors are good at their roles. But, so what?Artsy fartsy types make a living pretending that crap is art and Fargo is no exception. 20 years from now people will still be watching 'Seven Samurai' and 'Rear Window' and no one will even remember garbage like 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers' except to wonder, ""What were they thinking?.""Fargo does have one redeeming value though. Hollywood almost always depicts criminals as people with intelligence gone bad. In real life criminals are every bit as stupid as the ones in Fargo. I recommend Fargo to anyone who wants to learn what real criminals are like. Fargo has the reality... not 'The Godfather'."
1,An utterly pointless movie. 'nuff said?,"No? OK. How about this:Who cares if the ""accents"" were done well? You can win an Oscar for doing a great accent? So much for the meaning of an Oscar. How does an accent make up for a half hour long plot diversion that leads NOWHERE?This movie is one of those that DEFINES pointless, gratuitous violence - no matter how cleverly wrapped up in presentation, cinematography, or reputation."
1,Am I the only sane person watching movies,"I would just like to know if everyone was watching the same movie that I was, because Fargo was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I'm talking up there with Titanic and Over the Top. I would rather watch a Jerry Lewis telethon straight through than ever watch this movie again. I only gave it one star because there isn't a lower rating."
1,Overrated,"I have no idea who's idea it was to put this movie on the AFI's top 100 greatest movies of all time. And ahead of movies like Pulp Fiction, Goofellas, Easy Rider, and many others. This movie shouldn't be anywhere near the top 100. I can think of hundreds that are way better. I dont know what anyone sees in this movie. I thought it was terrible."
1,Depressing...,"I also do not understand why so many people rave about this movie. It has been described as a comedy by some. There were some parts that made me smile, yes, but nothing laugh-out-loud funny. I'm not even sure what film category it is supposed to go in. The storyline is simply unbelievable, and I hope that is not based on a true story, as I've heard. Overall, I spent most of the movie with my jaw dropped, eyes wide, and stomach roiling at all the gore. I couldn't believe the terrible violence of the movie, and the language is horrible as well. I felt an overwhelming sadness that this terrible chain of events was set in motion, and that so many people were killed for absolutely no reason. What a waste. After such great reviews of the movie, I was sorely disappointed. I certainly will not watch this again."
1,What a waste of time...,"I love DVDs and watching movies. This is one I wish I had never seen, and there are not too many of those. If you are tempted to buy it please please please rent it first and use the money you saved to buy a good movie!"
2,"Great film, poor DVD","My 2 star rating is for the DVD, not the film itself. Fargo won't win the Coen bros. any new fans, but if you already appreciate their particular brand of storytelling and wry sense of humor, it will definitely not disappoint. Alas, MGM did not see fit to give this Academy Award winner the proper DVD treatment it deserves. The print contains a number of scratches and the DVD is poorly encoded, resulting in pixel problems on a number of occasions. Save yourself a few bucks and buy the VHS until a better DVD release comes along."
5,A Masterpiece,"This movie is easily one of the best movies of the nineties. From the awesome acting and nifty script to the soundtrack and cinematography...It's a movie you can see again and again...If you haven't seen it, see it...You'll thank me...or better yet thank the Coen brothers"
5,MASTERPIECE,"I never get tired of watching this movie! It is one of the all-time best. The acting - Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are fantastic, to the dialogue and the plot, are the best...As other reviewers have said, although the story is ofa kidnapping plan that goes horribly wrong, (as if kidnapping itself isn't a bad idea), is is also one of the funniestcrime stories I have ever seen...Just remember it is a ""black comedy""...."
5,Well-Written Comedy,"Set in Minnesota and South Dakota, this crime story contains numerous characters with overdone accents. It is a dark comedy, with a bit of violence, but done with style. It's wonderful screenplay won an Oscar, as well as Francis McDormand as the pregnant cop tracking down two murderers. A treasure for anyone that loves 'different' movies!"
3,Interesting.,"I watched this movie, and I still don't know if I liked it. It was very real, and I guess that was good if you like that. Putting the body in the wood chipper was a bit extreme, however it added to the story, it made it go from typical movie violence to absolute realism. William H. Macy did a superb job of acting as did Francis Mcdormand. Do not believe what the critics tell you:""A funny movie"" it is not funny. It is about two people who are hired to kidnap someones wife. They do, and then flee that town. On the way, they brutally murder anyone who interferes with there plan."
3,Still a lot of edge enhancement,"I picked up the Blu-ray because I was hoping edge enhancement (meaning halos around persons and objects against light background) would be less pronounced than on the DVD. Unfortunately, I have to report that there's no improvement in this department. At the same time background was noisier than on the DVD. I have no idea why's that (you'd expect something else: since less Digital Noise Reduction was applied to the Blu-ray than to the DVD there'd be also less need for edge enhancement to counterbalance the undesired effects of DNR), but bottom line is, I could have stuck with the DVD."
3,For the Durrell lover,"This one is the first of Durrell's books and details his first visit to Cameroon and Africa, where he went about collecting animals for a zoo in the UK. The first half of the book is a little slow and lacks the general sense of observational humor that seems to peek out from Durrell's other books. The second half makes up for it though, for here, Durrell is in top form - humor, situational comedy and narrative flourishes abound. Slightly longer than the others that Durrell has written, a read I thoroughly enjoyed."
1,"If you can get it for free, get it.","I received this shade for free when I bought other products from Babies R US.My windows in the back have a curved edge to them. You have to place the shade high on the window in the straight area. Well you miss the whole lower corner of the window. The sun shines in through this lower corner. When I tried to move the shade lower on the window I could not fully close the window.If you can get it for free, get it. Do not purchase this item.I just recently went out and purchased new shade for my car to cover the corner this shade misses."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Do not waste your money on this roller shade. It is so cheaply made that the day after putting it in our car not only did the suction cups not stick anymore, but the rolling option broke as well. Not worth your money buy a more expensive roller shade!!"
1,not safe!!! worst!! DONT BUY!!,"I PURCHASED THIS THINKING BABIES R US WOULD MAKE A QUALITY ITEM. WELL I FOUND IT TO BE UNSAFE, STOPPED WORKING THE VERY NEXT DAY I BOUGHT IT, NOT TO MENTION IT DOES NOT FIT SMALLER NEW CARS. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,1) Dangerous 2) Do not work that well,"If you take your car seat to the CHP for inspection/installation, they will make you take these off your windows and tell you not to use them. The reason is that they will likely become a projectile in an accident and can injure passengers in the vehicle, including your precious baby. Think about flinging one of these as hard as you can at someone's face or eyes and you get the idea (somewhat) of the damage it can do.A safer alternative are the window cling shades, hmmm can't exactly remember what they are called, but window tinting stuff you can get a Kragen and stick on yourself. It might not look pretty but remember it is only temporary and for the safety of your little one.Besides all that - they don't work that great."
1,Worst shades ever,"Got these for my baby shower & installed them in my car...they do not block the sunlight at all from the car--might as well have nothing there for all the good they do. And the worst part is that the support on the bottom of the shade is flimsy plastic & bent within a month from the pressure of being attached by one suction cup so that there are ""wings"" pointing into my car. Terrible product & I am replacing them with a better brand. I will definitely read the reviews first this time!!"
1,Really bad...,"It doesn't stick, if you have a rounded back window it doesn't sit right or you have to put it down lower so it does, and then you're leaving the top exposed. Also dangerous with baby, as I was told during a car seat inspection. After I was told that, it immediately went in the garbage. Was gotten free thru BRU promo, but it's better to get one that sits flat on the window"
2,Warped in Sun,"I bought one of these and one of another brand, and put one in each car. The other one worked great, but the bar at the bottom of this one warped in the sun within the first week. It simply wasn't worth anything, since the other brand cost about the same and was more durable."
2,A great lost/ignored treasure,I can hardly believe myself how solid this release is. I just picked up a near mint copy on vinyl this weekend and was I blown away by this outstanding relase. This is an essential recording from an essential blues man. Please give this a try on vinyl if you can find it!
4,ATDI gets great,"An excellent sophomoric follow-up to ""Acrobatic Tenement,"" ""in-CASINO-OUT"" builds on their startup style by leaps and bounds. An excellent halfway point between their start and their excellent finish (Relationship of Command), buy the album with the annoying name to type and listen happily. An earnest transition into a more polished sound than on ""El Gran Orgo"" and ""Acrobatic Tenement."" This album is an excellent choice for a hardcore punk fan, an ATDI fanatic, or a casual listener who happened to get hooked on ATDI's unique flavor of punk."
3,At The Drive In Not Like Being At The Show,"Before hearing any of there records I saw At The Drive In at the CMJ Festival. They put on a great show! definatly worth seeing if your into Fugazi, Emo, and Rage Against the Machine (Unless you only listen to Fugazi and Rage for their lyrics). This album on the other hand isn't a must. A very average indie rock album; nothing new here."
2,blah,"I picked up this album after hearing alot of talk about how intense these guys are live. Personally, it reminds me of Rage Against the Machine and bad indie rock/emo..."
5,Easily the most ridiculously energenic show I have ever seen,"I'm not going to try to pigeon hole this band. Awesome music! Songwriting leaves nothing to be desired. What you need to do is check it out. If you ever have the chance to see them live,... don't think twice."
3,good but not great,"i do like this album but it does not have the polished sound that relationship has. The songwriting has not changed, but it doesn't sound as clean or as powerful as realtionship of command. If you really like at the drive in's song, and don't think that the quality is that important, then definitely buy this cd, but if you are a stickler for good quality, i would steer clear of this release."
3,They are no Native Nod,"Seems to me all the reviews so far haven't looked at this album critically. ATDI is inconsistent, at best. Notable songs are the second and fifth ones. Other spots on the album tend to take away from the listening experience."
2,"Almost, but not quite, there","2 1/2I can only really respect ATDI's final release. The other two, while certainly having their share of unique, head-turning moments, especially for those steeped in the punk scene seeking fresher approaches, overall feel strained and sometimes even silly. It is a pleasure then, when we can see the band shaping their primal dual ingredients of melody and aggression to full effect on a few tracks throughout the noisy, jagged release."
4,ATDI is incredible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This album is pretty good. some tracks seem a little lackluster but hourglass and transatlantic foe more than make up for it. hourglass is perhaps one of the most amazing songs that i have ever heard. the vocals are down right spectacular. i would shell out the 13 bucks just to hear this song alone!!!
4,Occasionally amazing.,"At The Drive-In may only be batting .500 on this release, but a lot of what they have here is just incredible. ""Alpha Centauri"" and ""Chanbara"" both pick up the slack that Jawbox left when they broke up, and ""Napolean Solo"" starts off as a slow, swinging 6/8 ballad and slowly builds until they pummel with a ferocity that Unsane would be proud of.Unfortunately, songs like ""Hourglass"" and ""Lopsided"" bore me to tears. If At The Drive-In can play off their strengths and avoid their weaknesses, they'll be the best band ever."
1,"GREAT ALBUM, CRAPPY MASTER: BUY THE JAPAN REMASTER","In its short life, One Way Records rarely sonically updated anything, opting for the low (cost) road of issuing CD's from old, sad and tired LP-EQ'd masters.This CD was no exception. When A/B'd against the 2002 Japan remaster, it sounds pitiful.Both of these CD's are now OOP, but the Japan version can be found at around the same price as Marketplace Sellers are asking for the inferior One Way edition.It is highly advisable, however, to contact the Seller before purchasing to confirm you're getting the Japan disc, catalog # UICY-3371.Why pay the same money and get less quality sound? Get the Japan import!Link to the Japan remaster ofEmitt Rhodes."
4,Alumno aventajado,"No muchos han sido capaces de hacer música similar a McCartney y salir bien parados. Con 20 años y ejecutando todos los instrumentos, Emitt Rhodes entrega un álbum de sorprendente calidad y que recuerda mucho al McCartney de la epoca final de los Beatles. Se pueden oir ecos de Martha My Dear, Ob-la-di Ob-la-da o Let it Be, y los 12 temas se mueven desde baladas con mínimo acompañamiento hasta agradables y rítmicas piezas pop, destacando sobre el resto Live Till You Die y You Should Be Ashamed.No hay grandes pretensiones en la música de Rhodes, esto es pop simple pero del bueno, sin grandes adornos pero gratamente adictivo. No se le puede pedir más a un talentoso veinteañero que inicia su aventura solista en la huella de una leyenda viviente. Un buen disco para iniciar la década (3 estrellas 1/2 hubiese sido lo justo)"
1,Defective,"One of the wires wasn't soldered to the battery. Unfortunately, even after soldering it the battery wasn't charging."
4,Cold corpses everywhere!,"In this installment of the Bed-and-Breakfast Mystery series, Judith Flynn goes to the Mountain Goat Lodge to cater a weekend retreat for some phone company executives. Cousin Renie has invited her along because she is making a presentation to the board and her caterer has dropped out at the last minute. What was to be a short 1-day trip turns into several days as a giant blizzard snows them in to the lodge. The characters reveal themselves to be a self-centered bunch, interested only in advancing their careers. Judith and Renie discover a skeleton while they are out exploring and then several murders ensue. Everyone there realizes that it must be somebody at the lodge, so there is much fear and mutual distrust. After several red herrings, Judith, of course, deduces who the murderer is. This is a good read, if you enjoy cozies."
2,Not up to Daheim's usual standard,"This book was disappointing in an otherwise excellent series. There were too many characters, and none of them were likable, so it was hard to care when they got killed off, and almost all of them did. That was not a very credible plot at all. This could have been a great cozy whodunit; snowed in at a mountain retreat, a number of suspects, no one getting in or out, etc. The background of the characters just wasn't interesting or identifiable to the reader. Also, too many corpses were piling up, which just was not believable. Daheim usually has funny characters and plot lines, but this entry just didn't work."
3,So wanted to like this book!,"I really wanted to like this book. It has all of the elements I love . . . a snowbound setting with a handful of eccentric types, one of whom is the murderer. I truly hate to give a negative review, but I was disappointed. The book was dull, in my opinion. It lacked real suspense, and there were too many characters who seemed shallowly drawn. It was hard to get a handle on them or to care which of them would end up as murderer or victim. It was also a distraction that the protagonist and her cousin kept calling each other ""coz"" throughout the book. I'm going to have to pass on the rest of the series."
2,Did not care for them being away from the Inn,"Of all this series, I cared for this one the least. It took place away from the familiar neighborhood, the B&B and although the ""coz's"" were together, I missed Joe and the rest of the characters."
2,Not really an ice shot glass.,"You have to serve the shot with the plastic container. In other words, you cannot have a shot glass made of ice only. Pity."
5,One of the best Brazilian Singers,"I loved ""Tudo em mim anda a mil"". Vange Milliet is definitely one of the best singers of Brazil. She mixes the rhythms and swing of her country with the music other parts of the world. Her version to ""Funkier than a mosquito's tweeter"" of the Nina Simone's 70 years repertory is fantastic, and have the german drummer Marlon Klein as a guest. If you want to know more about the new generation of the Brazilian music, you have to listen these album."
2,Writing in an experimental phase,"Yes, this novel is Smollett's way of experimenting with the ""novel"" form. Not only is this book confusing and irrational, but it is full of weird wordings and gaps. I had a hard hard time reading this novel and after several reads and some Cliff Notes help, I was still as confused as before. I couldn't imagine a teacher assigning this book without being fully prepared to answer the reader's confused state of mind after the first few chapters. Perhaps I am not as literary trained in novel reading as some people, but for me, a good novel must capture the reader's attention and emotions. This book didn't. I flipped through this novel in utter confusion and doubt I'll be rereading this anytime this century."
3,Back pictures given provide a mixed message.,"The pictures provided on this product's description show two different backs.The case I recieved had the back piece shown in the middle picture, a black swivel clip.This clip is hinged by a very flimsy peice of plastic. It's not even a real hinge. This is not obvious in the picture shown, and in all honesty I was hoping to get the clip shown in the third picture, which looks to be much more solid.It remains to be seen how long this clip will hold up, but I'm rather dissapointed. My last body glove case was terriffic. This one fits great, but the clip leaves alot to be desired."
5,Better than OEM,"OEM accessories are supposed to be superior than aftermarket copies, in style and function. However, Motorola missed the boat here. I bought their 'leather' case, and was very disappointed. I read the reviews for the Body Glove Ion and went out and bought one. I have not been disappointed. There is no comparision between the Ion and the OEM case. The Ion is far superior in construction, style, and function. All the necessary holes are punched out exactly where they should be. The stitching appears to be more precise, and the overall fit for my V60i is much better. The dimensions of this case 'hug' the phone much better, thus it shows off the phone's clean lines. The low-profile design equals less bulk. Motorola engineers need to go on a field trip to the Body Glove offices to see how the competition is running circles around them in the accessories market."
3,Very early work,"This collection includes the very best tracks from the very early period T Rex, before they made the breakthrough in about 1970 and when they were still caught in the hippy-mythology thing, long before their megahit Hot Love. It is fairly interesting British folk-rock from the late 1960s but I think the title is somewhat misleading. The only tracks that really stand out are Debora, Child star and Salamanda Palganda,. Skip this one and get one of the complations that includes Hot Love and Get It On (Bang A Gong)."
4,An informative but strangely written book.,"Thomas P. Grazulis has obviously dedicated a good part of his life to studying Tornadoes. This book has ""labor of love"" written many times over between its pages. And yet, it is an odd book. Grazulis combines tornado anecdotes, tornado science, tornado safety and even tornado mythology into a strange hodgepodge of information. This is not the book to buy for great narratives of tornado destruction. Grazulis' accounts are second hand and mostly used to illustrate his other points. Nor is the book packed full of great pictures. It has some, all in black and white photos and some that are more than a century old. This book is really an encyclopedic account of everything there is to know about tornadoes. I learned a lot, even if I found the book's style a bit bemusing. If you love tornadoes on more than a superficial level, I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."
