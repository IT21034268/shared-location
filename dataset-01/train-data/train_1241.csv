4,Using two of them,"at two different locations and working great so far. No power outages and they have been in place for few months now. My only complaint would be more outlets for battery backup, however I am using it with networking equipment which isn't it primary use so I can't ding it for that. Once a power outage occurs it will be interesting to note what happens and I will try to update my review. I would certainly recommend this product to people."
4,REVIEW OF CYBERPOWER CP1000AVRLCD,"Using the unit for backup of a desktop computer system and attachments. Unit is attractive, setup was easy (only necessary to charge unit) and ongoing operation is satisfactory. Have not had the chance to use the unit in a backup situation but assume that it will act accordingly."
4,Vertical Mounting FUBAR,"All the functions seem to be working just fine. Unit came fully charged, but I charged it anyway. The LCD screen shows everything it's supposed to. No issues at all with the working of the unit. However,...If you are going to mount it on the wall, and you want it hung vertically, the screw slots require it to be mounted UPSIDE DOWN!!! Who is the idiot who let this pass through the design review?I have to order another unit, which I will mount horizontally, but I'm curious to see if they are all like the first one or I got the oddball."
4,Good product but does not fit my application,"Unfortunately the CP1000AVRLCD does not recognize or accept the 120 volts output from the inverters on my boat. The purpose of using the UPS was to bridge the gap while turning from shore/generator power to the output of the invereters. Since it does not accept the inverter output, the internal battery discharges and all systems shut down. Pitty because there is no good reason for this behaviour."
4,It works,"Product seems fairly solid functionally. Already had a few opportunities, from power blinks, to multi-hour outages, to see it in action.The only complaints I have are ""beep beep... beep beep... beep beep"", but I can live with that. The cooling fan, like cooling fans are prone to, is already droning with dust when it starts up battery mode. I can live with that too.In short, a couple annoyances, but it does the job."
3,Ok,Good product. Unfortunately it wasn't strong enough to handle a Mac Pro tower and Cinema display. Probably perfect for average computers.
3,OK so far,"The item seems solid, was easy to set up, and has performed satisfactorily so far. But we haven't had any long power outages lately, and I've only had it for a month. To my mind, long-term reliability is a key factor."
5,back up your pc and monitors,You need to backup those pc's and monitors now a days while working. I lost all my files once and I swore it would never happen again. This thing will give you enough juice to save all your work files and then shut down your pc's normally.
5,CP600LCD,I bought this to replace another vendor's failing unit. Everything I need to have Vonage phone service is backed up with the CP600LCD. I have had several power hits without having to reset any equipment. I also like the feature that displays the amount of time that remains until the backup won't work.
2,Disappointed with this UPS,"My edition of this UPS has been in operation for over two years, and all internal tests indicate operation well within defined parameters. During the past several months, there have been severe lightening storms in my area, and power has dropped out momentarily (~1sec) on three separate occasions. In EACH case, this unit has not snapped to battery power for at least 500 milliseconds, allowing the computer to crash. The unit behaves as if the relay that activates at power dropout is being substantially delayed. DISGUSTING!UPDATE: After posting the initial ""sour-grapes"" review, I continued research on my problem. When I built the current desktop computer, I incorporated a PFC power supply (phase correcting, to increase conversion efficiency), and literature available indicates this UPS may not be compatible with that type of power supply. I've already ordered a PFC-compatible UPS (Cyberpower), and will report on the results once it is in place."
5,Great UPS - Works as advertised,I have three computers and a TV plugged into this unit. It gives me enough time to shut down my stuff when I have a power outage. I would buy the same unit again.
5,I love this thing,"I have a problem here at my house that the power goes off intermittently for a split second, causing all my computers, routers, etc. to restart. This solved my problem. And it has enough capacity to hold 3 computers, my routers, internet phones, etc. Great product."
4,get ups / conditioner,"I bought this to replace a old cyberchute unit I had. The display on this unit is great - easy to see, read, and use. The seperation of conditioned and conditioned/battery vack-up plugs on the back is clear. The unit came fully charged, as well. I plugged my equipment in and I was up and running in a matter of minutes! I would definitely recommend this unit."
4,Good UPS for the price you're paying,"After my Belkin 600VA UPS battery died, I found it would be only a little more expensive to buy a new one rather than replace the battery. So after doing some searches, I ended up picking this unit to backup my PC. After unboxing, I plugged it in and it loaded up without issue.Plugs are label on back, which are UPS and which are surge only. Blue LCD screen only lights up when there's an issue, or if you press the display button on the front panel.My one gripe with the device is the placement of the coax plugs, they're right on top of a UPS socket making it hard to place the larger plugs that seems to come with all PC devices currently on that side.All and all, a good device."
1,8 Minutes of Junk,"I purchased this unit thinking it would be a good value for the features. I let it charge for 24 hours before I plugged anything into it. I then plugged in my computer (without a monitor) and a tiny Buffalo NAS. Then it was time to give it a test. I unplugged the Cyberpower unit to simulate a power failure. The LCD read out 63 minutes remaining. ""Great!"" I thought. Then over the next 8 minutes it spiraled down to ""4 Minutes remaining"" and I had to plug it back in to keep it from dying completely. I let it charge again overnight and repeated the test. Same result. 8 Minutes. That's all I got out of this. I think that would qualify as junk."
4,Nice Power Center,Nice unit. Does everything it says it will do. Not too big. Heavy though. I have had no issues with it at all.
5,"efficient, low heat and great display","Wastes very little power. The UPS runs very cool in AC bypass to load mode with the battery fully charged. My entire entertainment system (HTPC, 37"" LCD, AV receiver, cisco router, wifi, cordless phone base, and 24 port gig ethernet switch) runs on this for about 30 min drawing about 125W with the TV off. Everything on it tollerates the modified sine wave just fine, and the UPS tollerates 2 pole 3600RPM gasoline generator power too (will charge on generator power).Wish that the display could stay on all the time though. Powerpanel software is a little cheesy, but works."
1,Honoring their quarantees,"I would like to put out a ""buyers beware"" for anyone thinking about purchasing a surge protector/battery backup system. CyberPower a company out of Shakopee MN does not stand behind their replacement guarantee. We had purchased 2 of their battery/surge protector units. During an electrical storm one of them was hit. I heard it and it made a beep sound after. My computer, DSL server asnd monitor hhad to be replaced. I sent the old unit in to Cyberpower and they told me there was nothing wrong with it. That is a impossible. The computer tech validated what happened. When I phoned CyberPower the customer service rep did not even look up my name in the system or anything. I would strongly advise anyone who wants peace of mind using their protectors NOT to purchase one from this company."
4,Unit works - LCD display is not correct for time remaining,"Lots of power and big battery for the price. But:At setup I noticed the display of time remaining was about 91 min. with no load connected. With a very modest load (46W for a DSL modem, Router and new 20"" iMac) it showed about 70 min. This was way less than the advertised 170 min. I called CyberPower tech support and got a lot of ""I don't know"" and was told I would never see numbers as high as 170 min. So I put it to the test. After the first 60 min. ""time remaining"" droped only 10 min. The ""time remaining"" display is not linear. The second 60 min. showed a 35 min. drop. Sometime in the third hour it ran out of battery.I believe the advertised values are a little optimistic but it should be close to the advertised value. I'll bet the chips in the box were calibrated for a smaller unit with less battery so they show low numbers. I wish tech support would have not tried to obscure the display issue."
1,Horrible quality control and can't return!,"I bought two of these units within the last 4 months. The first unit seemed to be great. The second failed within a couple of days. LCD display reading oddball stuff, no power etc. The first now is not working either! Everything looks good, the self test passes, their Windows app says the battery is full etc., but on power outage it shuts right down! Amazon won't do a return because ""they contain hazardous material"". REALLY? Didn't they ""contain hazardous material"" when they first shipped them to me? If you MUST buy one of these, and who knows maybe you will have better luck, I would suggest buying from a source to whom you can return if necessary. These units are really cool when they work. The LCD is nice and the software is decent, although it doesn't seem to create Windows event log entries. I think the real issue is that QC on these is really awful."
1,Interruptible,"I purchased two of these for my house, which very often gets brownouts, and one seems to work fine, supporting a NAS, a DVR, a router, and a cable modem.The other one though is simply unable to keep a desktop PC from interrupting when the voltage drops for less than a second. This makes no sense, because even when I get an outage, the PC resets (right at the moment of power interruption) and then it keeps working from the battery!"
2,Poor functioning,"Battery is not charging automatically. Have been using the product for only 6 months. Did a self-test and the battery was at critical - apparently not charging until manually performing this check. Thought this was odd, so I wrote to customer support and they sent me the newest software. I installed, waited a month, and again, the battery was at critical until I manually performed a self-test and then it started charging. I'm disappointed in the functioning of the product."
5,Does what it says it does,"This UPS was actually nicer than the picture gives credit for. The On/Off button illuminates a blue light similar to most PC buttons, so this matched my PC very nicely. The LED display does not stay on, but I don't mind as I'm not too concerned with the info anyway. As long as it does the job. Which it has done so far. No complaints. Worth the price tag? well I hope so. As long as it keeps my PC from frying it is worth it. Comes with a control program you load onto the PC and you can adjust different settings, but I have not figured out how to utilize it to its full potential, and the instructions do not explain much.Overall I would recommend."
1,Surge protection failed,"We experienced some power surges this morning. The power supplies of equipment connected to this UPS were damaged. Equipment connected to other UPS units on the same circuit was not damaged. It is headed for the dumpster, and we will be replacing it with something from APC."
3,Power vampire,"The unit requires a ground plug since it constantly leaks about 11 volts to the ground. I could not find in the instruction manual how much amperage is being diverted to the ground (in other words power being wasted).Furthermore, as a matter of safety, I expect the ground wire to be used only as a safety feature by appliances and not used as a normal electrified circuit.For these two reasons I returned the item."
5,Cyberpower 900 watt APC,"This is a great unit, fully charged outa the box. Easily keeps up with my gaming rig. (Rampage Formula, Q6600@3.7 per core, 2 4850x2's, 3 hard drives, 8gb, and a full watercooling setup... Also like the ease of use with the included software..Really impressed with the price/performance ratio...Highly recommended..."
4,Great Product,"Bought this product about a month ago, it works great. Love the display option. It does have a plastic smell, but its not overwhelming even in the small room. Would recommend it."
1,CyberPower CP 1500AVRLCD.....Desk Sculpture,"CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD Intelligent LCD 1500VA 900W with AVR Tower UPSI received my CyberPower CP 1500AVRLCD....Tower UPS to discover two things. 1. Configuration is near impossible to realistically use: you can either have visual access to the readout or you can access the receptacles but not both. 2. UPS devices are not returnable to Amazon. My advice, then, if you need a UPS backup power supply, is to buy one with the receptacles on the front of the device, where you can actually get to them, and buy locally even though you might pay a little more. At least you'll see what you're getting in the store and will be able to return it if, for any reason, it is not suitable."
1,Battery died within the first 2 months,"Within two months of purchasing this item, the battery is completely dead (and I never experienced a power outage). They obviously stuck in a used battery and shipped it out as new. These people are a bunch of crooks and Amazon should review their business practices before allowing them to rip off any more customers."
2,Near worthless,"Buy a bigger battery. In fact, buy an APC battery. This small cyberpower option barely provides power for anything. I originally bought it to provide power to a 46"" television. Nope! The battery shuts off, overloaded. FIne, I'll use it for my computer as its intended. Nope! Computer + monitor overloads the battery. Ok, let's just do smaller objects. XBOX 360 and two small home wireless routers. Nope again! The battery is overloaded and shuts off.Basically this battery system is only good to power very small and completely unimportant items that you probably wouldn't care about backing up with a battery anyways."
5,Exactly what it says it is,"This unit does exactly what it claims. I use it in my office for emergencies, and it keeps me up and running for about 30 minutes on loss of commercial power."
4,back up power supply,It worked well in the test I preformed but their is no way to predict the battery life. It will handle 2 computers for about 10-15 minutes. Enough to shut off the computers. I bought it because we have 2-3 power outages that last only a minute or less . This keeps the computer from restarting in safe mode each time it happens.
5,UPS unit,I was looking for a smallish UPS unit to provide continuous power to my ISP modem & Apple router... we have occasional commercial power hits... this unit is sized nicely to easily handle the load on both of those devices plus handling my laptop... small enough to tuck away out of sight...
4,Nice unit for a great price.,I only have 1 server in this office and so i didnt want to spend thousands of dollars on another UPS. This has come in very handy for a low price. Thanks!
4,Seems fine,"I've only had the device for a month or so, but it seems to be operating as expected. The battery life is sufficient and the ability to silence the power loss warning is priceless -- if I could only do so with all of my APCs. It is a fair deal for some minor power security."
5,It was a perfect choice for me,"It looks wonderful next to my new computer. They match like they were made at the same factory. Not only does it look real good but it seems to work well too. I give it five stars for looks, functionality, and intelligent design."
4,Best price for the power rating.,"These power supplies have been so good for me, I use them on my PCs and flat screen tvs and home entertainment electronics. So far they are reliable and easy to use."
2,Only works one year,huge power nice for lots of devices but will not last long this is my 2nd next is a better brand
5,Good UPS,"I have a 50"" plasma TV, DirecTV box, audio amp, and a CD changer plugged into this unit. So far I've only had one power glitch, but the sat box didn't need to refresh etc. It appears to be doing exactly what I expected. I would suggest it to a friend."
1,False Claims,The product did not even support 1/2 of the actual 340W rating. So I tried using it just as a expensive surge protector. Five days into use the whole unit failed.
2,over rated,"This product is fine for what I purchased it for, which is to moderate the currant feeding my electronics. However their advertizing is greatly misleading as far as the run time at a given wattage drain after a power outage. Had I been aware of this I would not have purchased it."
2,Obnoxious,"Even with the software provided, the ups starts to beep and repeatedly forces me to click ""cancel"" in 10 second window, otherwise it will shut down my laptop with 50% laptop battery left. All while I'm actively using the laptop. I could care less if the ups runs out of juice while charging my laptop battery. The fan is really loud. My gaming tower with 5 fans makes less noise. Together with a very loud fan, annoying beeping and dumb force shutdown that I cannot disable, I give this product 2 stars at most."
5,Back-up Battery Power For Sensitive Electronics,Arrived quickly and without damage as I reasonably expected. The kind of experience all Amazon purchases or transactions should be. No problems--functions flawlessly to date. Have one for my computer set-up (minus printer) and landline/hard wired phone. Ensures 'clean' electricity to sensitive electronics. Quick turn-on when power goes out; computer doesn't turn off. Read instructions regarding printer and TV uses--different electrical consumption needs. Newer LCD TVs may be OK.
5,Has already saved computer... WOW!!!,"With all this record breaking heat this year, I had NO idea of all the spikes and drop(s) in incoming voltage we are having. simple to use and tracks all actions..it is amazing to see how well this is actually protecting my modest computer setup. Money well spent !!!"
5,UPS,It works fine. Not much else to say. It's part of the infrastructure and just needs to quietly serve behind the scene and never draw attention to itself.
3,Plugs Too Close Together,"I like the display on Cyberpower UPS's and, in general, have been satisfied with their performance. I wanted one that could handle a particularly high power load and this one fit the bill. The only problem is that is has a very small form factor, so the plugs are all very close together. You either have to not use multiple plugs on it or you have to use those power strip extenders, where one end plugs into a UPS outlet and the other end is for your device. It's awkward and makes for more clutter...but you can utilize all the plugs that way."
4,No complaints,"It was easy to setup and I use it for AV equipments, which it easily handles all of with barely any load register. I haven't had a power outage yet, so I haven't officially tried it out, but I'm happy with it so far."
5,"So far, a 5 star.","This thing seems to work very well. I really like the software that comes with it. You can go through the entire help system for the software in one evening (or less). The software is very easy to install and use. Most of the time, you won't be doing much anyway, because you can set this thing and then just forget about it.Mine works fine. The software lets you easily test the unit by putting it temporarily on battery power. This is very easy to do."
4,Well plced plug arraingement,"This is a nice product for our entertainment plug-ins. We tend to have a lot of power surges and it even prevents outages of our modem, which has been overly sensitive for years."
4,Great UPS,"It runs for 8-6 minutes with my ps3, wireless modem and 50"" HDTV, i didn't think that it could handle my hdtv with the others things but it does.i have used this for 3 weeks, for now it runs great not problem at all, two blackouts of 3 and 5 minutes and it didn't runs outPERFECT !!!"
4,Performs as expected,"I purchased this UPS to provide a short amount of battery time for a few network devices and a NAS. With the network devices and a NAS plugged in, the UPS shows 35 minutes of runtime when on AC power. I've tested it by unplugging the UPS and noticed that the time goes down to about 22 minutes.I also have this connected to a Netgear ReadyNAS NV+ and the NAS is able to monitor the runtime of the UPS and shutdown once the UPS reports a certain percentage of battery remaining. This is one of the reasons I purchased this UPS so it's good that it functions correctly.Pushing the power button on the front will turn off the UPS without warning. I've had a few other UPS devices that make it a little less easy to turn off by making you hold down the power button."
5,Cyberpower backup surge protector,This product replaced my old APC unit that needed a new battery. It works great and the price was right. I use it in the lightning Capital - Central Florida.
4,Great Product for the Price,"The UPS arrived as described and on time, a very attractive device that i was happy to place in my home entertainment center, at my location i frequently have issues with lows in power and outages, this ups def helps me prevent any damage to my equipment, i run a 42"" lg 1080p, direct tv dvr. 600w denon receiver with 6 speakers, linksys wireless router, playstation 3 and a cable modem. with all these running i can get up to 20 min out of the UPS even tho the digital readout only says it will last for 12min, when buying a home entertainment system this is a way better investment than a quality surge protecter(like the monster brand one i bought at $59.99). i would recomend this item to anyone intersted in power protection. a great value."
1,Garbage,"Didn't even last a year. Very disappointed in the quality of it. Sounded to good to be true for the price and features, and it was. Nothing quite like a server crash because the battery won't even last 30 seconds. I will not be purchasing from this company again. I guess the old saying is true: You get what you pay for. I almost forgot; the LED display went out after about six months. We had the unit in a dust-free,climate controlled cabinet with our small business server."
5,Cyberpower CP1500AVRLCD UPS - LCD Display 1500VA/900W AVR 8-Outlet RJ11/RJ45/Coax Tower USB,"Works as described, lasts for 30 min on my gaming system with 4 hdds, oc'd i7, 12gb 1600 ram, 24 in monitor, cable modem, router."
5,100% Satisfaction!,"I have had this thing for almost a year and I like it so much I am getting another. These are a must if you have an expensive TV. Also I have a computer hooked up to it and when the power flickers in the house every couple of days, my computer stays on without skipping a beat.GET ONE.....At a Hundred and some dollars this deal is way too good to pass up."
1,Bad purchase,"This did not work when I received it; it would not charge. It could not be returned to Amazon because it is considered hazardous waste so I had to contact the manufacturer for return and replacement. I am still waiting for my replacement from the manufacturer; it's already been more than two weeks. I would not recommend purchasing this item through Amazon, too much hassle if it doesn't work."
4,Works better than expected but can't see display at angle,"I'm happy with the performance and it has already protected my Apple Mac Mini and LCD TV set up during a storm and during power outages. My only beef is the display, which shows interesting information is impossible to read, except from directly in front of it. Mine is on the shelf in the cabinet below the TV, flat on its back. The only way to view the display is to pull it out with all the cords attached.Other than that, it works great."
5,great UPS,I've been using this UPS for some time now. It integrated perfectly with my Iomega StorCenter ix2-200d. It is very quiet. I've had 2 power interruptions since purchasing this and the NAS drive never had a blip. I've always used the APC brand and decided to try the CyberPower. Great choice!
3,had some problems,They do stand by their product. Customer service was extremely nice to deal with. Sent it back and they replaced it immediately.
4,PGB,The UPS (uninterrupted power supply) has plenty of recepticles for all the equipment I needed to use and the battery seems to hold for about 15 minutes. That is plenty of time to do necessary shutdowns.
5,A Great Product,"We have a small office with a server and 3 computers of which some have duel monitors. We have 3 of these units in service which not only connect to the computers but also service our printer,fax and postage machine. We had an oppertunity to see how these units worked when we were hit with a scheduled power outage last month. Amazing results 25 min.run time."
2,CyberPower CP825AVRLCD,"I'm not real happy with the performance of this UPS. I was hoping for more than 6 minutes runtime for my computer. My 1500VA APC UPS gave me 25 minutes runtime on the same computer. This unit contains one HR1234W battery made by bb-battery.com. My APC unit contains 2 Kung Long WP1236W batteries. 12V 9ah 36W. Made in Vietnam. In comparison, I was expecting 12 minutes runtime on this unit.My Kill-A-Watt meter also confirmed that the LCD display is rigged to always display 120V output voltage when running on battery. My meter showed that the voltage flucuated between 117v and 124v. My APC UPS maintains a fairly steady voltage of 114 volts when running on battery."
5,Well designed ... Good Value,"I work in IT and work with backup supplies almost daily. When I chose one for home, I wanted one with adequate power reserves, functional design, reasonable cost and good software interface. Cyberpower may not be the largest or most prominent UPS manufacturer on the market, but they met all of the criteria for my home application.- The physical design is flexible, functional and the build seems good.- The UPS has an easy to read display for input voltage, battery condition, minutes available, etc.- The software setup and status software is intuitive and flexible- The connections, outlets and controls are well labeled and easy to access- Cost vs Power is competitive with anyone- Packaging provided very good protection to the product- Replacement batteries are readily available and cost less than $20.00I'm not sure what else you would need for a home UPS."
1,CyberPower doesn't honor their warranty,I bought this unit on 4/3/2010 and it had problems from the very beginning. Would not turn on with out holding down the display button.I submitted a support ticket and a claim on 5/23 and initially was contacted by a support tech. His first response was some canned email that was way off the mark. When I ask him to respond to all the information in my inquiry he said that the unit was indeed defective and he would get the claim process moving along for me. The unit doesn't stay on when you remove power then to boot it back up you have to hold down the display button for a good 60seconds. It also fried one of my flat panel monitors. So no one ever got back to me and I have left voice mails and sent three follow up emails. No one is calling me back no one is returning my emails.Very disappointed in this company.
4,Just works...perfect!,"I bought this about one month ago. No problems so far. I had the power go out once and this ups was able to keep the computer, display and all desk accessories including lamps going for 20 minutes...i used to use a Belkin unit which never was able to keep the same computer going for more than 5 minutes. Highly recommended."
4,good in unstable power areas,"I live in the country and have frequent power outages. This is a great addition to my home office, it keeps my pc fully running for 34 minutes. I liked it so much I ordered 2 more. I'm running an i7, P6T, diamond 5850, in a Cooler Master HAF full tower with a 700w power supply.Only down side that I can see to this unit is the power button seems to be to easy to push and often gets kicked off since it's under my desk"
1,Very poor tolerance for generator power.,"This unit does not work on generator power. I have an office with three UPSs. Two are APC and the third is this CyberPower. When we powered back up on generator after the storm, the APCs worked perfectly and did exactly what they were supposed to do: they stayed on line power mostly all the time, except for every now and then when the generator dipped below the threshold. This Cyperpower, however, went into a fit of cycling on and off battery about once every 10 seconds despite the fact that it was getting a constant 120 volts 3 volts. It was impossible to get in touch with tech support.I have not had the chance to test the unit again on utility power because the power has not been restored yet. I will update my review when this becomes possible."
4,One flaw,"The one major flaw of this product, and this has happened to me twice in the month I've owned it. The power button is huge and on the front, making it very prone to getting knocked into and powering off everything powered into the UPS. Other than that it setup very easy and has been doing everything it advertises. Haven't had a power outage to test it out in yet, but I'm sure it will work fine. So, I figured I could test it by unplugging it from the wall. With an external HD a powered USB bus and a 27in iMac not running any intensive programs I get ~40min from this device."
2,Faulty unit,"Unit worked fine for 3 months and then burnt out (it would stay up for 10 secs and then shutdown).Sent it back for repairs but Cyberpower will NOT pay for shipping to them. So, that was another $40 out of pocket for me despite their warranty.Received the repaired unit back after about 3 weeks total and so far working fine."
5,So far so good.,I bought this because my electrical utility has frequent voltage spikes and short power outages. So far it has stopped one voltage spike and the battery has kicked in once for a two minute power outage. I'm hoping this thing lasts because reading the reviews on the Internet it appears most manufacturers don't believe in high quality anymore. If it ever stops working I let you know.
1,Waste of my money,"When I first set this UPS up my power blipped for a second and it saved my Compaq from crashing like it usually does, however the next day and forward it was utterly useless. The power would blip for a second, with nothing but my Compaq plugged into the backup sockets, and it would crash instantly as if back on the old surge strip and the battery gauge read depleted. I also had problems getting power from one of the regular surge sockets. I'm not sure if this particular unit simply cannot handle my basic Compaq PC or if I needed the Pure Sine Wave version or if it was defective, but the experience has me considering APC next time. I guess I'm stuck with it as a doorstop in any case since it's classified as hazardous shipping material unable to be returned. Money's tight and I sure could of used it for something else."
4,Cyber power battery backup power supply,Provide battery back up allowing time for proper shutdown of your computer.Lots of protected outlets.Poorly placed mounting holes in the back of the unit.Does not allow the unit to mount right side up if vertical.
4,What's in a name?,"This UPS is supposed to be one of the better ones. It arrived the day before Thanksgiving and I charged it for the recommended 16 hrs then plugged in my TV, cable box, and Bose 3-2-1 system. The light is on but nobody's home: the display doesn't work, so I guess it's a case of call the company or return it as defective. Great way to celebrate the holiday. :(Update - Eight months later - Spoke with manufacturer's rep and have been very HAPPY with this unit. I was mistaken about the display: It works when you push the power button. The power has gone off a number of times and the UPS has beeped to let me know I'm on battery backup. No problems turning it off, or turning off the TV, surround system, and cable. It does what I'd hoped it would do."
3,Nit a powerhouse...but OK,"It really doesn't last as long as they say or think.So...set you shut down up for an immediate, orderly shutdown of your equipment after only a few minutes of no power and you should be safe for an easy and full restart of your PC or server."
4,Good UPS with Limitations,"I got this CyberPower UPS to protect my home theater system. I have a 55"" LED TV, PS3, DVR, Receiver, and bunch of other accessories all running of the UPS and it works flawlessly. The LCD displays a wealth of information (just wish the back light would stay on instead of going off after a few seconds!). Had it's first test a few weeks ago when we lost power in a snow storm. All the lights went out but I was still watching TV as if nothing had happened! Safely was able to shut everything down. Don't expect to run all your electronics for any extended period of time - that's not what this UPS is for. At about 50% load I had about 8 minutes of run time. Also be aware that you cannot run this unit off of a generator (unless you have one of those expensive inverter generators). The power is just too variable from the generators and the UPS kicks on and off constantly. Other than that, great product."
1,Not High Resolution Audio - 24/44.1,"This is barely better than CD quality at 24/44.1. What a huge disappointment! Since the point of DVD-Audio is to offer high resolution and surround sound, this disc fails miserably. Yes, you get surround sound, but to call 24/44.1 ""advanced resolution"" is not even close, especially when compared to the more common 24/96.This disc only contains the surround mix. There is no stereo mix included.Do not buy."
4,Melt-in-yo-mouth delicious,"At first I was skeptical about this strange candy, but once I put into my mouth my views were changed. The rice paper, or second wrapper, is melt-in-your-mouth delicious and compliments the gummy citrus candy inside! WONDERFUL."
2,"Over Rated, Over Priced and Not Enough Product","This little box of candy was $4.00 It contained six little candies a total of 3.4 ounces and each of which will fill one molar. I must have missed something in the description. I thought I was getting more for my money than this. Each tiny candy = .66 cents. ""RIP OFF"" DO NOT BUY local prices are much better."
3,Don't buy it here - maybe elsewhere,"i bought it in a asian supermarket for 79cent. it was not as good as wat ppl's comment stated. it was only alright. very small box, only 6 pieces. I SAW THEM SELLING THIS IN THE ASIAN SECTION IN WALMART also."
4,Great!,The must have book for any Camera Assitant starting it's way through the film industry! And a must have referrence manual for any experimented AC!
2,Buy the individual stories instead. . . .,"I absolutely LOVE the Moles Sisters series. The stories are so igneous and sweet. We had three of the individual books before I purchased this compilation. I loved each one.Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this compilation. The beautiful illustrations are placed two on a page rather than singly like in the individual books. This throws off the timing of the story & is visually less appealing as the pictures are crowded & much smaller.Yes - the stories are the same & are still charming. However, spend the extra money and purchase the books individually. You will get more joy out of the stories this way!"
3,good but not all that and a bag of chips,"I think this book is good, But it's not all that and a bag of chips.I mean its 1:45 and i have to read a book and only have 15 min. to read this book is the grate one to read its cute and short of i like it i am shore you would too."
4,Henry and The Elephant,"'Henry and the Elephant' is one of the Junior JellyBean books recently released for preschool readers. While the story itself is charming in the Thomas the Tank Engine tradition, this book's most appealing features are the bright and expressive illustrations that accompany the pages of the story. The always-confident Henry has an unusual task to accomplish...transporting a circus elephant by train! Surprises and obstacles present themselves along the way, but as all Thomas and Friends fans have come to trust, all ends well and a valuable lesson is learned in believing in yourself and working cheerfully with others. The book is quite small, but is very appealing to little readers with little hands. Makes a wonderful gift, and the price reflects the smaller size."
2,Looks cheap,"It looked better on the website, but they look cheap in person. If you can't fold a square this is a good product, but a real square looks so much better..."
2,Less than advertised,This article was in poor condition. Several of the pages are loose but there are no missing pages. It is soiled and will fall apart unless it is handled very carefullly. I am very disappointed in the condition of the book and certainly it is not as it was discribed.
2,Heavy Plowing,"This book could be some much more readable with, perhaps, an editor and another draft. The author has to juggle a lot of details - historical, political, social, biographical and statistical - but does so in an ungraceful confusing manner. The writing at times is distractingly florid. I compare this to Big Trouble by J. Anthony Lukas that handles a wealth of period detail with grace and a simplicity and directness of language that sweeps you along. I was very disappointed given the natural drama of the story."
3,A Disappointment,"The book itself is not bad. The writing is dry but still readable. My problem with it is that only about 100 pages total are devoted to the fires themselves and those who were directly affected by them. The far greater part was devoted to the political, legal, and social events before and after they occurred. Three or four chapters of such material is necessary to set the events in perspective and carry on the histories of the people involved, but two-thirds of the volume is excessive for a history of the fires."
4,I like it,"It is a very nice and relaxing CD. I can feel the space around me. Espically when I listen to it at night, when it is all dark around me."
3,"Plaintive, justification of a military take-over","A sad and plaintive account of the lead-up to and decision of General Sitiveni Rabuka to stage and execute a ""pre-emptive"" coup d'etat in his homeland of Fiji. Rabuka tries repeatedly to garner the reader's support for his military takeover, and he nearly succeeds. In the end, it shows itself for what it is: a work of self-justification for overthrowing the legally elected government."
4,LIVE 1968,"A live recording from 1968 with Bill Hardman on trumpet, Billy Harper on tenor sax, Julian Priester on trombone-1st track only-and a rhthym section led by Ronnie Mathews. My copy says Live at Slugs. The track listing is identical so it must be the same. Angel Eyes is a ballad feature for the Trane-like tenor of Billy Harper. The sound quality is acceptable for me."
3,Not at all what it seems to imply,"This 3 disc set has maybe 15 minutes of Hulk Hogan.False advertising aside, it has some interesting matches and really captures the time period well. A lot of good workers were relegated to dead end projects like this because WCW had been shut down. So while it is interesting to a person who loves wrestling history and enjoyed WCW or currently enjoys TNA, it would be worthless to the common wrestling fan. No great matches, no great promo's, and the one Hogan match included is also on the third Hogan DVD set WWE put out.So I wouldn't suggest any but the most hardcore fans and completists to buy this."
1,No wonder why its lost,"Hulk Hogan has nothing to do with this company. He wrestles a terrible match against Curt Henning that should have stayed buried. He cuts a few promos here and there but its nothing that is overly exciting. After watching this dvd its no wonder why this company didnt last very long. Of course, Tony Schiavone is the worst wrestling commentator that has ever walked this earth. I dont know why Jerry Lawler agreed to such a crappy company. While Knobbs, Hart, and Valentine had a great reason to open XPW, it didnt work out as they hoped. XPW would close and anther company would move into there taping area- TNA."
2,shlocky B grade Wrestling show given star power by Hulk,This is a second ...no third (2nd would be TNA) class Wrestling promotion. Buy it for curiousity sake or for a very very limited appearance by Hulk Hogan. Actually the best cameo or brief appearances may be by the late great Mr Perfect (Curt Henning)...and even Marty Jannetty (the fellow who punched out HBK Shawn Michaels).
2,Huge Disappointment!,"I had hoped this book could be my benchmark for herbal information. What I found was a book that was hard to use with little useful information. ... Otherwise, Facts and Comparisions' Review of Natural Products is a better choice."
4,Natural Medicine Education,"The Complete German Commission E Monographs is a reference book that anyone dealing with natural medicine should have.The knowledge gained from this book give one the tools to administer natural medicine in a much safer manner.The book gives the uses,actions,doses,side effects,interactions with other medicines and contraindications.It also gives the duration of use for certain herbs.I highly recommend this book.Cromwell Parris"
1,modern science tries (& fails) to understand herbs,"If you want to know how German doctors use herbs as alternatives to pharmaceutical drugs, this is the book for you. If you are an herbalist, or just want to understand the wonders of medicinal plants, don't bother with this book. For example, yarrow, known to be a favorite of herbalists the world over, is listed with ""not recommended"" due to lack of research, even though it has been used for over 3000 years in multiple cultures, and has over a dozen medicinal therapeutic actions. Save your money."
3,Winnie The Pooh Calendar,I only wish I could view the photo/drawing for each month before i purchase it. At 1/2 off it's quite a deal I think!
1,A complete farse.,"La Tourrette is a poster child for what's wrong with Martial Arts in America.His book, like his videos is a sales pich to the weak minded who want a quick mystical secret to mastery in the Martial Arts.Save your money and maybe your life by looking elsewhere for your Martial Traing Reference,"
3,"As Many ""Collections"" as They Have Original Releases!","I'm really new to the Stranglers in the big picture of things. Either they never really crossed over the Atlantic or when they did I was off doing other things, or both. So I only got into the Stranglers about two years ago. I got a very best of cd and it has gotten me hooked to acquire their whole catalog. I've got 4 cd's in and each one has at least 2 or 3 really good songs on it (probably more its still very early, I got them today). All I can say about this collection is that I am amazed that the Stranglers have put out so many different live and greatest hits cd's. Amazon has listed 90 Strangler items and I would bet that 20 of them are unique live and greatest hits cd's. If you buy one of these, chances are after a while you will yearn for everything they put out, the songs are that good."
5,WOW!,In a word - ENERGY. Seems MC's put his layoff to good use.There's no way you can't be pumped up by this CD. Seems like he's got more energy than the old days. How that's possibleI don't know. Like another review I read - it's MC Hammer all right - but the voice is more forceful and sure of itself than ever before. This new Hammer will excite any fan of his or the dance/rap genre.
5,"It's Hammertime, Again!","MC Hammer is back with his new CD Active Duty. This 19-Track CD with all new material will surely please any true MC Hammer fan. This new CD also features other artists from the label. Overall, I think Active Duty is a great CD, and is a great addition to any MC Hammer Fan's collection. (...)"
1,looking for christian hip hop?,if you are you have came to the wrong place. I am a big fan of MC hammer's show on TBN and was really excited to find out he had a new Cd out. So I went out and bought it unfortuantly the CD dissapointed me very much. While there were a couple bright spots Cali and Spittin fire his CD had no flow whatsoever. Plus pretty much all of the songs were focused on hisself. It even has a song nite show that is not only secular but is unbiblical as it talks about a man being a slave to a woman which led me to break his CD. If you are looking for christian positive rap Check out tbone or john reuben but not mc hammer. But his preaching show is still good maybe he should give up rapping
3,warped in time,"all those who reigned in his era are now wallowing in there self pitty and struggling violently to rise above the realm of the has beens. While so many have fallen victim to age, contreversy, and simply passing there prime..... mc hammer still pushes out a bold attempt at re enterring the spotlight.if you hadnt been aware of the release date apon first listening you would have passed it off as a solid hip hop album for 1990, but obvoiusly... that is simply not what it is,. this album is dated and overdue by over a decade and it seems that he is stuck between his prime and today with no way of getting out. if you are an oldschool fan than this album shouyld keep you content... but if your looking for something new you simply wont find it digging up coffins ( metophore for hammers career). i trust most of those who purchased this album got what they expected,.... because in todays music...who buys an mc hammer album for cutting edge music??????????????."
5,The triumphant return of Irish rap!,"My jaw dropped when I learned that McHammer, the world's greatest Irish rapper, had returned with an album of awe-inspiring pro-American rap just in our hour of need. I knew our friends on the other side of the Atlantic wouldn't let us down, but a show of support as strong as this record by McHammer is more than I could have imagined. I really think that with this new offering McHammer may have dethroned Milli Vanilli, that piece of Italian pop perfection, as my all-time favorite artist!"
2,I wouldn't even recommend this to fans,"I was, like most Hammer fans, excited to see this album in stores, but I must say that my money would have been better spent on any of his other albums. There are a lot of bad songs here, especially becasue Hammer doesn't even appear on a number of them. And the good songs aren't even that great: Hammer's never been great with his delivery or lyrics, but as time has passed, it seems like he's gotten worse. He tries bragging about himself and his crew, but that's not exactly something he should be doing ten years after his heyday. The few bright spots really stick out (""Our Style,"" featuing some skillful rhyming from the Stooge Playas, and ""Ain't no Stoppin' Us"") because of the weakness of the rest of the album. I hate to drop on Hammer, but this was really not this attempted comeback was more of an embarassment than anything."
1,This is a Canon scam,"I love my Canon digital camera, but this is a scam designed to fool people who think Canon is selling some kind of special AA battery that will work especially well with their brand camera. As I type this, Amazon is selling a Sony AA-NiMH charger/battery pack for less than half this price. Better yet, spend a little more (though less than this Canon price) at Radio Shack and get a system that lets you charge various NiMH battery sizes. Don't be fooled."
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this charger years ago, when I purchased a canon A70 camera. Batteries and charger still going strong! A good buy!"
2,No Bass,I recently baught an Altec Lansing 2.1 system for my Girlfriend for $50.00 and was blown away at the quality - really outstanding. I needed a 2.0 system for my office as I have no good place for a subwoofer and decided to stick with what has been an impressive brand. I was sad to see that AL has stumbled badly with these speakers - bass close to zero. In order to keep these sounding at all passable I am forced to use really exaggerated EQ settings within iTunes. Very dissapointed.
4,Great for listening to cd and mp3 players,"I purchased these solely for listening to my mp3 and cd/mp3 players, without having to wear headphones. These speakers sound pretty decent for the price; I am able to hear the full range of sound from the highs to the lows, now, the bass isn't floor shaking, but it is quite good. The speakers seem to be able to do justice to my music (everything but rap), there is great stereo separation. They are quite solid and heavy, with included stable, metal stands, or, you can stick on the included rubber cones if you prefer. They are pretty easy to set up and hook up to the device of your choice. There is a headphone jack and volume control. For the money these are a pretty sweet deal..."
1,Sounds like a cardboard box,"Just got these and set them up. Very dissappointed. I bought them because my old cheap-o Koss speakers were dying. I never thought the Koss sounded particularly good, but these are much worse. I'm not an audiophile - not picky at all... My goal was just to find something affordable and decent-sounding for playing trance MP3s in the background while I work. These are not what I was looking for. The stereo imaging is good, but that's the only good thing I can say about them. The highs aren't crisp at all, and the bass ""thumps"" - but not in a good way. It'd hard to describe, but to me it sounds like a cardboard box. Not enjoyable, and quite distracting."
5,A flavoring I can't reproduce from scratch,"I used to be able to buy this near my home, but now it's inexplicably disappeared from the supermarket shelves, though other Asian Home Gourmet products are still sold.My habit in buying from the supermarket was to simply sweep every single package into my basket whenever I came across it. It's that good.The sweet and sour flavoring works deliciously when mixed into a batch of fried rice. Start by frying in a teaspoon of olive oil srimp and fingernail-size chopped vegetables, add 2 cups or so of cooked rice, and, following that, two or three raw, beaten chicken eggs. When the dish is almost ready to serve, mix in one package of pineapple rice paste, cook a further 2 minutes or so, and serve.Everyone I've served this to (including some eaters of wide experience) has remarked on the unique flavor. Strongly recommended."
5,"dark, twisted, sad, funny, scary and all around brilliant!","Cruddy became one of my favorite books of all time. The world that Lina Barry creates in this novel is a sordid, topsy turvy, and all around creepy enviroment. You wont be able to stop talking about this book after its over. I've made all of my friends read Cruddy and they've all loved it. After reading about this girls messed up life you'll feel so much better about your own!"
2,cartoonish,"At times a disturbing book with nauseating characters who alternate between alcoholism,abuse and murder. I didn't find it frightening, scary or unnerving if anything it seemed overly cartoonish and at times a bit repulsive. Major complaint: too over the top. The plus in all of this though is that there is some dark humor wrapped within but the whole suicide thing and the abusive father was really too much and the whole violence for the sake of violence gig has been done one to many times."
1,this is literature?,"Tediously gory, the novel fails to elicit sympathy for any characters; indeed there are no characters, just grotesque assemblages of tics and emotional/physical wounds. Disheartening to see that something like this gets well reviewed. Emperor's clothes syndrome: people afraid they'll seem uncool if they don't embrace gore?"
1,Apt Title,"This is a truly horrible book. Every single image in the story is ugly, cruel, disgusting, depressing. There is not one socially redeeming element. The greatest horror is placing us in the mind of a child who was unable to escape the degradation of her life. I cannot figure out what humor some people claim to have found here. A dreadful excuse for a story."
1,CRUDDY BOOK!,"It is kind of a coincedence that a book which I would describe as CRUDDY bares that name in it's title. I read reviews of this book when it first came out, and it sounded like an interesting read. and was supposed to be funny, certainly not haha funny, but weird funny. This book, which I couldn't even finish cuz it was so depressing, weird, and just plain annoying, is not a good choice if you are looking for a good story about high school students on acid or whatever drugs happened to pop out in each chapter. READ: GO ASK ALICE instead! It's much more entertaining and is a real story written in a diary form. Also, the art work is horrendous...I want to submit it to THE MUSEUM OF BAD ART, which does exist, in Dedham, MA. SKIP THIS ONE<"
1,Couldn't even read....,I bought this book expecting something quite different and couldn't even read this writers story. Guess I am just too old to understand the interpretation of this particular teen's thoughts and actions.
1,"It really was ""cruddy""",The title describes both the style (a misnomber) and the content. Don't waste your time. Better to take a short nap.
5,Deliciously disturbing,"This is one of my favorites! Addicting, imaginative, and makes your skin crawl. Definately a must read."
5,I knew Lynda Berry was dark under the surface ......,"But this book grabs you by the collar but you don't wanna be let go of...So dark, yet you can't stop thinking about it weeks later. There is something in the way Berry writes dialog that just sounds so right, real, it trips the lower reptilian brain, and you get flash backs to your own youth, which may not be such a great thing....Or is it? She is "" Cool Hand Luka"" for the dysfunctional teen set. Her detachment allows the characters viewed thur her eyes to appear as they are, no subjective additions. Pure survival mode. Get this book now."
1,Doggie Catcher is Bad Deal!,"I purchased two of these terrible items for my dogs. They are both large dogs, over 55 lbs., and love to ride in my Jeep Cherokee. First of all, the only thing you get is a wide black strap with a cheap metal clip on one end and a plastic thing on the other end. No instructions. When I clipped my precious dogs to the strap, all was fine, they were a bit uncomfortable which I thought would be normal. I went into a store for 5 minutes and came out to find them terribly upset. One of my dogs had removed herself completely from her harness, it was still attached to the stupid strap. The other dog was completely twisted up and sitting in the next seat over. Both were visibly shaken and scared. I am extremely unhappy and disgusted with this horrible product. Don't buy this junk."
4,Good history of little known WW2 campaigns with 2 flaws,"Charles Whiting has written an excellent,readable history of a very important segment of WWII in Europe that the press,the public and even many historians neglected. The book has only 2 flaws but they are major:In dividing the book into campaigns both in the Table of Contents and the Chapter headings , the Invasion of Southern France and the Vosges Mountain Attack are shown with dates in 1943! Obviously they took place in 1944 after the June 6 D-Day Invasion in Normandy.The author deserves better than this. Either his editor or proof reader should be fired. I hope the 2nd edition corrects this."
4,WWII 7th Army,"I used this as a reference book to pull out precious details, as I was researching my father's WWII service."
5,Short but sweet,"This is one of the better books accounting the 7th army. It not only gives a detailed record of ""who went where when"", but also gave a few ""why's"" and did a good job of explaining the conflict within the army versus the French and in the U.S. general staff as well. My grandfather served in the 7th army for a time and this was a good filler on where he was and why. It actually gave a pretty good build up of units serving in the 7th and how they were shuffled as needed. Highly recommended for a quick and easy read with a bit of detail mixed in."
3,The Book That Was O.K.,"I read the book America's Forgotten Army by Charles Whiting. It wasn't the best or the worst book I have read. In my opinion the book is for people who are really into World War II books. It gave a good deal of information about the U.S. Seventh Army, an army that helped win the war but never got the glory. It talks about the soldiers and commanders who fought bravely in the war.I personally did not like the book because to me it was boring. I did not understand half of what the book was saying. I also forgot what I read just two pages ago. Some parts I did find interesting though. I'll let you just read the book for yourself. The book, in my opinion, is for advanced readers. If you are into World War II books though, then you might not want to miss this book."
3,Excellent Book,"This book has many areas that are not covered in other books and movies such as ""Patton"" and I really enjoyed how it focused on the common soldiers and commanders, while from time to time, interjecting some of Patton's enthusiasm for war.It is most accurate in it's military history save for a couple of small flaws, and the characters included in the book are amazing. Overall a really good book expecially if you like military history."
1,"Superficial, disjointed & mildly racist","This book is less a work of serious military history than it is a written version of a series of Movietone news reels of the US 7th Army's campaigns in the Mediterranean and Europe in World War 2, right down to the racial overtones typical of the period.It jumps around in time and place, from one action item to the next, rarely fully developing anything. It leaves the reader with the distinct impression that the only troops of any value are white American boys, blacks (the author's term, not mine) are only good for driving trucks in the rear areas, and that whilst using napalm in the Pacific on asians was OK, using it in Europe on white folks wasn't.If you want to read a thorough, yet accessible history of the US Army's campaign in W.Europe in WW2 I recommend ""Eisenhower's Lieutenants"" by Russell F.Weigley. Leave Mr.Whiting's piece of pulp history on the shelf"
4,Does the trick,"What an excellent review of all the ways a person might preserve food! Much appreciated is the fact that each chapter is divided into the good, better, and best methods of preserving a particular item. This lets you decide whether blanching your carrots is really worth the time, or if tossing them in the freezer is nearly as good. However, I would have appreciated more photographs of techniques and recipes, but the quality of the book is otherwise top-notch."
4,Lindberg 1:25 Scale ford Crown Victoria Alabama State Police,My son did not realize that it was a model car that had to be put together.
5,Excellent Condition as described by seller,The book was in excellent condition. It shipped on time. I could not ask for a better transaction.
2,tasteless rubbish,"Tacky color that ruins the great original drawings, abridged stories and possibly too big and wrong sized pages like for the B. Potter Treasury. With these many errors, I wouldn't be surprised if they have Paddington eating Coleman's Mustard in the book and a coupon for 20 P off on a tin of the stuff."
2,"WELL, GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR TRYING","THREE GANGS ARE IN A WAREHOUSE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY'RE ALL READY TO EXPLODE AND KILL EACH OTHER. HAS SOME GOOD ACTION, BUT FOR HALF OF THE TIME, THE INTEREST JUST ISN'T THERE. EVEN SAYING ALL THAT, I THINK MOST ACTION FANS'LL STILL GO FOR IT. YES, THIS IS A FRENCH MOVIE. YOU HAVE THE CHOICE OF WATCHING THIS IN ITS ORIGINAL FRENCH LANGUAGE OR WATCHING IT DUBBED IN ENGLISH IF YOU'RE GETTING THIS ON DVD."
4,Great flick,"This movie is a great French action film. It takes quite a basic plot and turns it into a descent overall movie, not just a shoot em up. There is enough character development and great action scenes ( plenty of them too!) For those interested in foreign and/or action films pick this up. Also, for those of you who previusly wrote reviews asking why the soldiers sometimes speak to each other in english, that is because one of the three soldiers (the one in different camouflage) is German and they communicate with him using english."
2,hmmmmm,"i didnt think the dubbing in english was going to sound awful. i personally am a fan of Sami Bouajila and the dubbing of an arabic man with the sound of a black man's voice is just wicked horrid. the movie all around is fabulous, but if you shoppers decide to purchase this movie the best option is to buy it in the french version and just put on the english subtitles."
5,An exceptional action movie,"This understated piece of French action film is actually an excellent and uncompromising movie, and one of the very best action flicks in the past few years. It is a little bit odd that, even though the movie is mostly a remade of Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13, it is to The Magnificient Seven that explicit references are being made."
3,Worth a watch,"I just caught this movie on Showtime last night, about a half hour into it. It definitely caught my attention as I watched the rest of the show. A lot of action, gun fights etc, that were pretty entertaining. But as I watched it a couple of questions came to mind. 1) Why do the soldiers speak in english at random moments? and 2) does this not seem like the exact same plot to Assault on Precinct 13???? I mean c'mon, cops and thieves stuck in the same building, having to work together to fend off a force of bad guys trying to rescue their boss. Hmmmmmm. Overall it was a decent flick worth a watch."
2,FAQs are Better,"I don't just say this because I wrote a FAQ for this game, but I am an experienced gamer at SFOS. Early on in my gameplay, I decided to flip through this one day after trying to get through the game with some FAQs online and having a bit of the same types of troubles. I thought for sure this would be more helpful.Aside from the ""pretty pictures"" and lists/charts, this really didn't have anything useful like you'd expect. Besides, there are too many free FAQs online (mine included) that are just as (if not more) helpful. Some of them aren't any more detailed, but at least have their stuff straight.Heck, by the time you get to Yemen 1 you should be able to get the neck snap and not worry about the knife. But yeah, the sniper rifle in the tunnels you can use anywhere, so long as nobody sees you..."
5,The Funny Thing Tickles Funny Bones,"My son and I found this gem at the library and it became an instant hit. Though the original publish date was nearly 90 years ago, the subject captivated my son and myself. Drawings and text are pure Gag, (think Millions of Cats), but the story of the Funny Thing with the odd food preference will appeal to any parent who has dreaded making yet another peanut butter and pickle sandwich for a picky eater. The Funny Thing's choice of delicacies may seem a bit outdated to adults, as does Bobo's tearful reaction; however, be prepared to giggle and to add a new phrase (or food?) to your vocabulary...And very good they are, jumjills. And very good she is,Gag."
3,My Rechargeable Glue Gun Is No Longer,"What happens when your so called rechargeable Glue gun stops recharging? Where do you get replacement rechargeable batteries and or the recharger?I found this gun was just right for small projects when it works. A little slow getting the glue out when using it. Also cools a little too fast, maybe not hot enough. Would like to know where to get replacements though."
3,Not for every application,"Cold Heat Cordless Gun is ideal to work away from the base. However, I found it did not dispense enough glue fast enough for me to use. The glue hardened before the flowers were sufficiently glued to the wreath. Also, I had to squeeze and squueze and squeeze to force more glue out. For small jobs- it is OK. For production work or situations where you need a lot of glue- stay clear. It uses the mini sticks which melt very fast."
2,Just ordinary. Aimed at the amateur,"I guess this DVD would be okay if you just bought your first digital camera or didn't understand the basics of photography, but it sure doesn't help at all with the advanced features of this camera.Throughout this DVD the instructor refers to ""Part Two"" where all the advanced features will be explained. Trouble is there is no ""Part Two"". I emailed the company twice trying to determine when ""Part Two"" would be available but they never responded. Great cutomer service, huh?I'm sorry I bought it. $25 down the drain."
3,It was ok.,"The Dvd was not really what I was looking for, I wanted a DVD that gave more advanced instructions for the Nikon D200."
1,Not working too well,"I bought 2 of these soap dispensers, one started to leak through the 'window' after 6 months, the other begain to drip on and off after 9 months or so. I used the screw mount method to install these units(the only way), now I have to find replacements to cover those holes on the walls."
4,A Metal lovers Cd,Amazing CD! You do have to see them LIVE to reallyaprechate these cats! My boys are the bomb in concert.And the crowd invlovement is equal to a huge stadium show!I think if you don't like this cd then YOU REALLY DON'T LIKEMETAL!
2,On a pale horse - missing something,I gave this a shot I really did. I bought it from their website and listened to it at least 7 times. The problem is this band will never succeed without AndersColsefni (the last vocalist). I'm sorry but the new sound sucks and I wish I could return the CD and get a refund.Don't quit your day job
2,This book is really not that great,"Young and Jones goes through getting you organized in a sometimes funny fashion and they have a few good ideas but in its entirety, this book is very strange. As well as organizational tips, the book offers weight loss advice, bits of religion and seriously bad poetry. Give this one a miss."
2,A little outdated and out there.,"Was very pleased with quality of book and service to get to me. Great timing to my house! Love ordering books with Amazon. After reading the book, I realized that it has some good ideas, but there is a lot of cooky stuff too. First time invented philosophies of sort of alter egos to confront. A little too strange for my taste. But some really good organizational ideas. Thanks."
4,One of the classics,"Okay, obviously some of the people writing reviews here are not the kind of people it was written for. (""why would I need a card to tell me when to change the kitty litter?) We all know that lots of people in the world cannot even imagine that some people struggle with the simple routines of life. They think that people with messy houses just don't care. Really, even those of us who struggle sometimes can't understand why we can't manage those things that seem so simple for other people. Well, if you are the kind of person who can't understand why someone would need a reminder to make up the bed, do laundry, etc. -- you just won't get this book. If you are the kind of person who hates living in chaos but can't figure out how to get out of it, you just might love this book. Also, I highly recommend Sink Reflections and The Messies Manual."
4,Useful...but read their other book first,"I hesitated to buy this book since some of the reviews said it was basically useless and probably just an attempt to make more money on their part. But I LOVED their first book, Sidetracked Home Executives, so I decided to give this one a shot.While I agree that there's a lot of fluff in this one, there are also plenty of solid, helpful tips for optimizing their organizational system -- they wrote this 10+ years after their first book was published, so they'd had plenty of time to work out the kinks.Don't make this your first ""slob sisters"" purchase -- read Sidetracked Home Executives first -- but if you find that their cardfile organizational system works for you at all, I recommend getting this book to fine tune the system."
2,money money money!,"Their first book was actually helpful, and a bit of a novelty. It offered a different approach to cleaning that was geared toward the genetically disorganized, designed by genuine slobs. This was refreshing compared to a lot of the organizational books written by the naturally and freakishly organized trying to feign empathy for their inferior readers.However, this book doesn't have anything new to say. I felt like I was wasting time reading it because so much of the book was devoted to the authors going into detail about their personal family problems, which really doesn't help the dishes in my sink, laundry on my couch and the Polly pockets on the floor waiting patiently to embed themselves in an unsuspecting foot.I get the distinct impression that this book was an excuse for them to make more money. But, it does rehash their original ideas, which were all useful. Their first one was their best one, but this is better than nothing."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"Once I saw this book I couldn't put it down. I felt as if they were peeking into my home and writing about me! After reading many other home organization books and feeling like an utter failure I finally realized that I didn't fail, the system failed. Pam and Peggys book certainly helped me to see that. Their system showed me step by step how to become organized in a way that I understand and they did it without being strict and serious. The humor in this book kept me laughing as I imagined myself in similar situations. I am well on my way to having my home become a warm and welcoming place, my familys haven from the world."
1,Not what I had expected...,"I think that the authors our very sincere with their techniques, however I find that making an index card for every chore that needs to be done a bit much. It is more complicated than what I would have wanted to get my home organized. However I highly reccomend Sink Reflections. I have done wonders with my home after recieving this wonderful book. The author of Sink Reflections focuses on establishing Morning and Evening routines. And she is always letting you know that you are never behind, yet just begining. And it is Baby Steps all the way. You should check out the reviews for Sink Reflections. And no, I am not getting paid for this in any way, I just wanted to let you know what has and has not worked for me. Good luck with whatever road you take in getting your home in order!"
2,Strange book....,"I've read several household organization books and although this one is funny, there are better ones out there. (check out ""confessions of an organized homemaker"".) The organizational advice essentially revolves around the use of index cards and motivational games to get your family to pick up after themselves. While these are good ideas, the last couple of chapters go off course and delve into the authors personal lives and marital woes. A few lengthy, bad poems by one of the authors are thrown in as well. Buy something else."
1,Hassled with housekeeping?,"I was disappointed with this book It read more like a diary than a book to help organise your life, The authors seemed to be more interested in their life than mine. Give it a miss and try Flyladys books if you need help"
5,Get Your Act Together: A 7-Day Get-Organized Program For The...,"Great ideas in this book. If I put even some of them into practice, I'd be organized in no time."
4,Great!,"got the movie early and my little girl was super excited to get it in the mail!! no scratches, was perfect!"
4,Decent.,"Among the trash direct to video sequels Disney has released over the years, Bambi 2 stands out as a good film. Not great, but good."
5,Good movie,"I never new there was a Bambi two. My aunt had dvd's that she told my hubby and I to chose from. I took this dvd thinking it was Bambi, the first movie. But nope I was wrong.I have to admit, I like this movie more then the first Bambi. The first Bambi put me to sleep each time after Bambi's mom dies. I stay awake to watch Bambi two all the way threw."
4,"One of the better ""2nd"" movies.",I really do enjoy this movie and how it shows the back-story on how Bambi grew up so I bought it. I wish they did a combo pack with the 1st and 2nd movie like they did with The Fox and the Hound movies. The only flaw that I hate about Disney movies is that god damn Disney vault that makes me feel like I have to buy or I won't be able to get it again for 10 years. Also with Disney starting to make all their movies in 3D I wanted to wait but if it says going into the vault then I don't want to have to wait 10 years to buy it again let alone if they actually do come out with a 3D edition. That's my reason for 4 stars.
2,Bambi midquel,"I guess that's what they're called. Anyway, this movie was pretty bad. In the Bambi a life in the woods book, Ronno was a buck. In Bambi 2 he was a fawn. And at the end of Bambi 2, the great prince tells bambi that his mother was about his age. But the great prince lied, he is a lot older than bambi's mother. At the end of the movie, bambi is still little and he shows off his little antlers. I studied deer in class, and deer are all big and grown up when they start to get their antlers. Maybe disney didn't know.The songs were pretty bad. I like country songs, but I wanted to hear disney songs. Bambi and Thumper talk too much, too. Bambi calls the great prince dad. Bambi was supposed to call him father, because he calls his mom mother. And when Bambi falls off a cliff, he gets up again like he was never hurt. That didn't happen in the book.I think that this was a bad movie. It wasn't like the book. I want to see Bambi 3 about bambi's two fawns."
3,"great movie, bad disc",A fine Disney sequel to an animated classic. But the disc condition wasn't as advertised (like new). Multiple major scratches that I had to get refinished.
1,The Dad is MEAN,"I can't believe this movie got a good review from anyone. My son loved the original Bambi so much, and I was excited when we found this sequel. We were very disappointed. The whole movie revolves around Bambi's relationship with his father, which isn't a good one in this film. His dad is very mean, and I got a lot of questions from my 2.5 year old about ""why the daddy is mad at Bambi all the time"". My son has enjoyed every other Disney cartoon movie he has seen except this one."
2,very disappointing,I was very disappointed because it was closed captioned and I hadn't realized that when I ordered it. That ruined the whole movie for me.
2,Very upsetting,"I thought this sequel was horrible. I watched it with my 3 year old daughter and it really upset us both. I expected a nice tale of fatherly love and guidance. Instead, the father is very harsh on Bambi after his mother dies.There is one scene when Bambi dreams that his mother has returned, then awakes to hear her calling, and runs to find her. He is then chased by hunters and his father comes to his rescue only to yell at him after leading him to safety (this is the part my daughter had tears in her eyes).The father does bond with him at times, but then sends him away with a foster mother. Only after an almost replay of his mother's death, does Bambi father decide to keep him.I know Disney likes to kill off a parent or two in their movies to make a dramatic story, but come on! This one was brutal!!There were some cute parts with Thumper, his sisters and flower. Other than that, the movie was pretty upsetting!!!"
1,Better than Orson Welles!,"Wow, I must have missed something. This movie has a better Amazon rating than ""Citizen Kane""? I have to say I didn't think it was as good as that."
1,Very disrespectful,"We shut the movie off just a few minutes into the film, after one of the fawns tells his mother ""I told you to not to talk to me when I'm with my friends."" Jumped up and turned it off. Very disappointed in Disney. The orginal Bambi is a great movie for little minds, teaching them to mouth off to their parents in a the sequel is just not okay."
5,Bambi II,"This was a wonderful sequel to the original movie and it picks up so well. It was nice to see how Bambi grew up with his Father to teach him everything that he needed to know to survive in the forest. The movie teaches children a lesson on life, respect and family."
4,Bambi II,A must for us Disney movie fans and a true enjoyment to watch and share as a family. An escape from the stress and tensions of everyday life and to spend wind-down time with your family.
3,One of disneys best direct to video sequals,I am not a fan of disney's direct to video sequas becouse most of them are just horriable. I was really surprised that this film was actually good. It dosent come close to greatness as the first one but it's still a good film. The animation was surprisingly really good I think they did a really good job. the story is kinda pointless at times but they aim more for the younger audiences. I think people wont be dissapointed in this film.
3,Not bad!,"After watching this movie several times I can say that it is not a bad sequel. However, it is not nearly as ""artistic"" as the original Bambi. Besides, this is one good example where even the latest advancements in computer technology cannot deliver quite the same artistic animation quality as the old hand-drawn Bambi... Nonetheless, it took courage to reach up and try to achieve the quality of the original Bambi, which in my opinion is the best Disney movie."
4,Bambi II - As good as before,I really loved this movie. It was funny and I think Thumper was the real star. I think lots of kids will love this movie.
1,Very very disappointing...,"I purchased ""Bambi II"" based upon the number of excellent reviews I found on Amazon. The original ""Bambi"" was the product of a collective genius. This ""mid-quel"" is typical latter-day Disney ""product."" All stock character types and cliches are predictably present and I agree with the parents who complain of the ""attitude"" of the young creatures.I'm sorry I opened the package and can't return it."
5,FANTASTIC!,"Bambi 2 blows other Disney direct-to-video sequels out of the water and takes its place among the cream of Disney Classic Masterpieces. It is a truly worthy succesor to Bambi, which destroyed any chance of my growing up to be a deer hunter. The backstage featurette, The Legacy Continues, though brief, is impeccably presented. I cannot say enough good things about this DVD."
1,"Oh, gimme a break","This movie wasn't better than Bambi. Far from it. And these guys are right, it's not a continuation of Bambi either. I just find it so hard to believe that after all the h*ll you people have raised over how BAD disney's sequels are just suddenly come and adore this new junk. Bambi ll was so dissapointing, it made me sick. It was bad enough seeing The Lion King 1 1/2 ruin the original LK's perfect plot, but disney making a similar add-on to Bambi is just unforgivable. This is my last straw: I'll never buy another cartoon from disney again."
1,WHY DOES THIS MOVIE HAVE 4 STARS?! WHY DO YOU ALL LIKE THIS?!,"This movie is a piece of junk! Who cares about what happened to Bambi in winter?! Why do you call Bambi II a sequel?! Why are you all adoring this movie?! Why all the ""precious Bambi II, precious Bambi II, precious Bambi II""?! Are these reviews fake or what?! Will somebody please comment below?! What do you find appealing about this horrible cartoon?!"
4,Missing spanish audio track,"We bought this DVD and hoped that the 'unknown' audio trackis the spanish one (as usual with Disney DVDs).But no, ... this DVD was produced just with an english and afrench audio track.Bad luck for my daughter (she cannot understand) and for us(we had to pay) ;-)Still a good movie .. therefore 4 stars .."
3,Does anyone else have this problem with Bambi II?,"Though the story is 'sketchy' and a little thin, it is still an enjoyable movie and worth the money spent. My only problem is of a technical nature with the DVD. When I play the DVD, the movie shows the captions for the hearing impaired. I have to stop the movie EVERY time and go to the 'set up' page from the root menu to turn off the captions. Does anyone else have this problem?"
2,I guess you really have to be under three.,This is a blatant attempt by Disney to remove monies from the pockets of the unsuspecting. It is a most feeble attempt to score another hit but fails miserably. The animation is alright but the story and dialogue are bereft of any quality. If you must buy it be sure it's only shown to the very young as the other kids might kick and stomp you because of their irritation at placating their viewing habit.
5,Bambi II,I so much enjoyed Bambi II more I think then I did the original version of Bambi.It is something to hang onto through the years and show it to your Great-Grandchildren.Also my Grankids enjoyed it and said right away the show is a big (5).
5,The magic is still there,"The magic displayed in the original Bambi was still there in Bambi 2. You felt the same feelings about the characters as you did in the original, which I first saw as a child myself. Good for the whole family."
4,Thrown For A Loop,Heard this CD before I found out about the Joseph Diamond. He brings a totally different style to smooth jazz. This guy has a latin flavor to his keyboards that is hard to explain. I like it a lot and have already purchased his newest CD. I rate this CD very highly because it jumps off the beaten path and the adventure begins from there. Many customers like to stay on the safe side and won't take chances. I am different. You will not have to take a chance on this CD. I have done that for you. I recommend this CD
4,"Monumental work, if you know the subject","David Nicolle tends to be biased towards the Mid-East (ie: all good things in the Middle Ages come from Asia), but he manages to mostly leave his biases out in this monumental work. If you are looking for a pretty picture book, or an introduction to the topic, like various Osprey books, this ain't it. What it is a look at surviving pieces, iconography, statuary, and literary referrances to present a comprehensive look at what arms and armour of the period are recorded. Definately more for the serious enthousiast than the casual reader."
1,A giant book of drawings with brief info,"Upon opening this book you find that it is not really a book but a giant catalog of drawings of archealogical pieces many of which have nothing to do with arms or armour. Each has a brief description and if you wish to see the line drawing of the item described you must continually flip to the back of the book. Besides these short descriptions, actual text amounts to probably only 15 pages throughout the book. Not very informative overall."
4,Awesome!!,"These speakers were delivered less than a week after I ordered them. I am very impressed with the way they sound, the bass is awesome for listening to music and playing games, I hooked them up to my laptop with no problems at all, though you need to have a 1/8"" (Standard mini-headphone size for all laptops, cd-players or mp3 players.) cord that goes from the aux., which is located on the subwoofer unit to the headphone plug-in on your laptop. These cables are plentiful at any Radio Shack, Best Buy, or Compusa. You can't beat them for the price, and they also come with a cool remote unit where you can control the volume, eq. settings, bass, and has 2 headphone plugs. Very Very Cool!!"
4,Best Bang for the Bucks,"Picked these up a local retail store and they are really NICE. For the price it totally added to the 32"" JVC TV we bought...Cable Music,DVD's and PS2 games are much more dymanic now. We couldn't get past half volume without rattling the windows! This was the perfect fit if you don't wanna drop major ching-ching for a home theater system."
5,cool audio system,"This system performs surprisingly excellent in mid-low range,and it is also good at high range.Yes,it is originally designed for xbox.That's why it has such a strong bass.For a audio system cheaper than $30,it goes beyond what I had expected.Note that the system comes with audio cables.But in order to connect it to computer,you need a Y-shape cable with mini-3.5mm-headphone pin on one end and two RCA pin on the other two."
5,best sytem for the money,i've see alot of good reviews. so i had to try it and it is worth the money. the bass is lound and the sound is perfect. this system is well worth the money. i'm supprised it dos'nt cost more it so good.
1,cheap!,"The knife handles are a tad too short for comfort when being held, and the weight of these utensils is very light, meaning made very inexpensively. I sent them back."
1,Take a pass on these teaspoons...,"I was very disapponted in these teaspoons... They are lightweight, the design is unattractive, they bend easily... all the things you DON'T want in your flatware!"
5,very 'scholarly' but absolutely essential.,"It isn't the quickest or easiest read, but the information in it is a treasure trove for the person who wished to know the subject matter. It's like a super vitamin pill, a bit sour, but extremely helpful. I gave it five stars because of the command of the information."
4,delightful read despite the typos,"This author was so far ahead of his time! I could see his descriptions, and his art is lovely. The kindle version is loaded with typos, but is still understandable. Minus two stars for typos, but plus one for being free = 4 stars."
2,Misled a little,"The book itself is pretty good, it's just not what I expected. My problems are that it hit when I typed in Civil War so with the title I thought it would be letters to soldiers during the Civil War. No description was given to tell me otherwise. So you know how it is when you expect one thing and then a couple chapters in you finally realize it isn't anything close to what you really wanted how the disappointment sets in? That's what this book did for me. On the plus side I am greatly appreciative of the price :) I don't think that any book is ever a total waste and I did learn a few things from this one."
2,As photo paper goes...this one is LOVELY!,"Not being a pro photographer, I'd opted for this paper for a 8.5 x 11 color photo of myself to be sent to my stroke rehabbing son in another state. I was amazed at the texture of the finished product and the color saturation it allowed. Thanks for a great product. The transaction was impeccable as well."
2,Subwoofer has no power (literally),"I have been very disappointed by these speakers. I have the series III ones. While the treble sounds fine, perfectly clear...this system has NO BASS! My husband recently bought a $35 set of 2 computer speakers and subwoofer and his setup sounds 10x better than mine!Because the subwoofer feeds power off the stereo/reciever it's hooked up to, and does NOT have its own direct power supply or amplifier, it literally lacks power. This subwoofer is the biggest joke ever! I can barely hear the bass on most things, even with the volume cranked up.Bose products are extremely overrated and overpriced. Do not waste your money -- buy something worthwhile (for a fraction of the price!), and make sure the subwoofer has its own amplifier/direct line to outlet."
1,BOSE STRANGE ANIMAL,"In the last 40 years I have listened to people critique BOSE speakers. I have owned the 501 series IV since 1984. The extremely LARGE wood grain box speakers that have not produced for many many years. 100% WOOF AND TWEET. They still perform as well as they did in ""84"" and any compact version of this or any top brand will never compare. Two years ago, I purchased the 301 bookshelf speakers also from BOSE. They produce a very clean, yet super midrange sound. The case in point is that SIZE, DIMENSION, and decade of manufacture can triumph or put SHAME on technology. The BOSE name is now pretty much just a logo. STRANGE ANIMALS."
4,overpaid,"I LIKE THE SOUND OF THE SPEAKERS, BUT DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT IF I HAD WAITED ONE WEEK, I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE SAME SPEAKERS FROM AMAZON FOR FIFTY BUCKS LESS."
1,Thin sound,"I should have read all the negative reviews that are out there about BOSE. They sound super thin.. no middle tones. The passive sub-woofer is a joke. I did a comparison on the same Onkyo receiver I have between my super old, cheap floor standing speakers (some off brand from BestBuy, bought in 2002) and this system. Every single song I played, sounded better on my old speakers.Just go for JBL, HK.. or whatever else.. just not these here. Sad, I was really looking forward to de-clutter my living room."
5,Great speakers.,"If you're looking for a small footprint, then these are excellent. My wife was tired of the big boxes next to the entertainment center, so we now have the acoustimass module behind the couch and only the cube arrays on the entertainment center. I used a DTS version of Steely Dan's Gaucho to give them a test. They passed with flying colors.I can't help but wonder if the negative reviews are from people who haven't properly set up the equipment. You must run wires from the amp to acoustimass module, then back to the cube arrays, a total of 4 wires. This is also something you need to consider if you want to hide the sub.Another thing to keep in mind is that this is not a powered subwoofer. The 3 piece system is intended to replace 2 large speakers, not 2 large speakers and a powered subwoofer. If you're using a powered sub for the x.1 low frequency effects, plan to leave your powered sub in the system. There is no way to send a dedicated x.1 signal to the acoustimass module."
5,Awesome sound!,I was very pleased to see the price for this sound system affordable. I really enjoy the sound when watching movies!
2,Acoustimass,"I'm a speaker lover, and not a Bose-hater. Bose makes some incredible speakers: like the 901, some of the best I've ever heard. The Bose Acoustimass series are not very good, frankly, but obviously fine for most people. Missing a significant portion of the midrange is OK, apparently, if they look cool enough. The bass is one-dimensional. If it weren't for an advertising budget, I'm certain no one would own an Acoustimass, since they will lose any head-to-head challenge at almost any price. My sister-in-law gave me her system since she knows I like speakers. I very quickly gave this system to my son for college, since it won't matter if it gets stolen."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"Replaced a 20+ year old pair of Bose 501 floor speakers with the Acoustimass 5.Ease of set up was excellent.Though I did appreaciate the added 'spatial sound' experience of the sub woofer, the bass sounds were definitely inferior to my ear than the old speakers. In order to get close to my preferences, I have to turn the bass way up and the treble way down on the amplifier. Though this does help some, 20/20 hindsight suggests I should have looked further into these and not rely solely on my past good experience from Bose."
1,this system blows (not in a good way),"do not buy this system. for the money there are much better systems out there.I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers. The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the ""acoustimass"" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges. The result is that you get a very ""tinny"" sound out of most applications including dvd's. I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice. Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine."
3,Go with a powered sub...,"Nice mid range and highs however I quickly found that I will need an ""extra"" amp to power this sub to levels that seems decent"
1,not a good monitor,"having previously owned a gateway monitor with a diamondtron tube which was very good, i bought this one. the unit i got had horrible vertical convergence (NEC-Mitsubishi has a sofware utility with test patterns for you to try to adjust everything) and a 10% dim spot on the right side of the screen. this was not due to some local magnetic field, as moving the monitor changed nothing. The vertical grid wires were loose near the dead spot. NEC-mitsubishi tech support kept telling me to ""whack"" the monitor to get the wires unstuck, but the problem is that the wires move *too much* and aren't aligned (you can see the wires on that part of the screen vibrate upon whacking). after much wrangling with tech support they very very reluctantly agreed to ship me a new one. the new one had good convergence but had the same exact dim spot on the right side. so i give up. if it takes more than 2 tries to get a nondefective monitor, it's not worth buying."
5,Joe Henderson's Five Blue Notes: An Oeuvre,"OK, here's what you do. You buy all five of Joe Henderson's Blue Notes [Page One and Our Thing from 1963; In 'n Out and Inner Urge from 1964; and Mode for Joe from 1966]. They are five elements of a single oeuvre. Listen to all of them until you become thoroughly familiar with this music and appreciate all its nuances. Then you follow the same procedure with the eight classic Wayne Shorter Blue Note albums [Night Dreamer from 1964 through Schizophrenia from 1967]. And then you will know what jazz music is all about. It's as simple as that."
4,Good toy that will entertain for many hours,This is a good toy that will entertain boys or girls for many hours. My only complaint is that the instructions that show you how to assemble it use different colors than the plastic pieces which makes it confusing for children. It has many small pieces so consider if it is appropriate for the child. Other than that it is a good toy and a good value.
4,Thirteenth Floor Elevators - 'Psych Out' (Aim Records),"Basically,14 tracks from their 'proper' album releases.Makes for fine listening and all,but how many times can they put these tunes out?Most memorable cuts are ""Roller Coaster"",""You're Gonna Miss Me"",""Kingdom Of Heaven"",""Levitation"" and my personal favorite,the mind-lifting ""She Lives In A Time Of Her Own"".Obviously,aimed toward the 13th Floor completists."
1,Horrible Printer,"I had an HP Printer that held up for 4 years of undergrad and one of law school before I decided to replace it (worked fine, just was a bit slow). Since I had such good luck with my last HP (5 years of printing) I thought I would get this model. I have been consistantly disappointed with it ever since. It constantly reports that it is out of paper when it is not, routinely pulls in 2 sheets at a time, reports paper jams when there is no paper in it, and has lately taken to saying that the ink cartridge can't move, which also isn't true since just turning the thing off and on fixes that problem. Whatever you do, don't buy this printer, if possible I would give it 0 stars."
2,Very irritating printer,"We bought this printer because our old printer wasn't compatible with our new Mac. I insisted that we buy an HP because our old HP printer was so reliable. This printer, however, drives me batty. It gets frequent paper jams, and I cannot get it to print envelopes straight. Currently, it is printing black print in varying shades of brown, despite the fact that I just replaced the black ink cartridge. Most infuriating, however, is its tendency to just stop working midway through a print job. This happens about 30% of the time. It will simply stop, and I have to go into the printer box on the computer to restart it. It is a huge waste of time and paper (it spits out the half-printed page when you restart it and starts that page over), and just plain irritating. I think maybe I'll check out the other brands when I finally lose it and pitch this one through the window."
2,Horrible paper handling,"I bought this printer for a few reasons. First was the print head cartridge combination. I had gotten tired of the innefective print head cleaning of my Espon c-80 (soon to head to the junk pile since I can't get the print head to print reliably anymore) and wanted to avoid that issue alltogether. The second reason I bought it was its footprint, which is great for a small desk (or under the desk in this case). Lastly was price.However, its paperhandling is horrible, and I concur with a few of the other reviewers complaining about the same issue. The ONLY way it will feed paper (standard 24# white) is by my moistening two fingers and gently pressing the paper forward as the printer seeks the next sheet. Frankly, this is NOT an acceptable alternative. While it seems that some reviewers are not having this problem, the machine I have is a lemon in this regard. I would not recommend this printer."
1,Yet another bad home printer,"This printer is so much worse than the ""Office"" printers that HP sells. Apparently, HP believes that home users will put up with a lot worse performance than office users will. This thing drinks ink like there's no tomorrow, refuses to print envelopes, and refuses to print alltogether about half the time I try to print anything. Very disappointing."
2,16 months and it's crapped out !,"I purchase a lot of PC's and peripherals for my job.Just over a year ago, I ordered a few of this model.The semi pros:- the black ink cartridge is an enlarged one. Probably a bit short of twice the tri-color capacity.-adequate print quality.- average print speed.The cons:- only lasted 16 months and now shows indicators that it requires a trip to the local HP service center.(We all know what that means. Pitch it and buy another unit).- tri-color cartridge is the small size.Conclusion:I should have stocked up on the older, FULL SIZED cartridge HP printers in the PRO series, like the 895 (I think it was).Still have a few of those going strong."
4,"It's great, but!!!","For the price, this is a great little home use printer; however, when I am trying to print web pages (I am a PSPer and print tutorials) it usually will only print about half of the pages and then just sits there. I have to cancel the print job, unplug the power cord to clear the memory, and then try to print the remaining pages. And as another poster said, it really is confusing when the printer dialog box shows an unusual amount of pages in the queue. (ie: 14/8) The print quality is FANTASTIC, it's just getting it to print an entire job is a nightmare at times."
1,HP DeskJet 5740 Color Inkjet Printer,"The printer does not work at all even if I tried to operate it with many ways. But due to avoiding waste of my time, I have not returned. This seller is not kind because the retainer of ink cartridges was disassembly."
1,Warning! Terrible Printer HP Deskjet 5740,"I can't believe how HP would make a product that functions this poorly. I agree with all the people who have given this printer bad reviews. This printer continues to jam up and I have to hand feed it all the darn time. I had an HP 940c and it was fabulous, so I thought HP was reliable. What a mistake. Hp should really have a recall on these. That would be the only way I would purchase another HP printer. I'll simply put it this way, I would not take a few minutes of my precious time to write this if I wasn't as fed up with the Hp Deskjet 5740"
3,Decent Doggy 101,"I watched this expecting it to be more of a training video. While it provides a dose of training advice it really is a survey of things to consider and prepare for before you get a dog (young or old) and it assumes that when it comes to dogs you are . . . well . . . a dummy. So if you want training, get a DVD dedicated to training. If you need a very basic look at what to expect if you get a dog, narrated by a not overly enthusiastic dog expert, this will do the trick."
5,Gorgeous and bakes beautifully!,"I wanted to make half-size pies and so I bought these. They are excellent quality, like all Emile Henry products. They bake evenly, look beautiful and are a joy to handle and use."
1,Look elsewhere for a real rocking chair.,"This chair is too small for a full grown man, and held together by staples. Look elsewhere for a real Rocking Chair."
3,Nice chair for the price,"We were in North Carolina at an inn and enjoyed spending time on the porch in a Carolina Rocking Chair. When we got home, my wife asked me to get one for our back deck. Amazon has this chair available at an inexpensive price so I ordered it. When it arrived and I opened the box, it was a little smaller than the one we had sat in so we were a little disappointed. It was also a little difficult without some elbow grease to attach the rocker legs to the chair. The paint job was thin in some areas as well. Nevertheless, we think that this chair is good value for the price and a nice addition to our modest back deck. It is a keeper. We may order another to have a matching pair."
3,Steering Wheel Puller,"Almost what I needed. I had to go out and buy 4"" M6 bolts to be able to pull my steering wheel off."
4,Tamron AF 200-500mm on Sony DSLR-A900 With Aperture,"I found the lens very light and easy to use in the field for Nature photography, especially birding. I'm getting excellent pictures although the auto-focus feature tends to search a little longer and with pin point focus it tends not to be so precise in those tight bird shots with many leaves. My Sony Mirror lens does a much better job when it comes to that type of focusing. Don't let the size fool you, it did me. I thought I could hand hold the camera while taking pictures and found out I could and they were very focused. I rated lower because of the speed of focus. I've used it for over a week now and found it to be rugged in the field. Other lenses I've used by other manufacturers haven't held up so well in that wildlife environment."
4,Sensitive account,"I can barely talk about this book- it's so good, you're there: You are a 14-year old boy in the 1970s. There's humor, there's ache, there are descriptions so clear you'll feel like checking the soles of your shoes for sand before you walk into your clean kitchen. The descriptions are so strong, that not only does the setting feel tangible, so do the vicarious insights one can gain from this account written in first person."
4,very nice,"I am very impressed with this. Amazing sound for the price. The only problem was one of the cables that came with the unit was bad, but I had another at home so it all hooked up quickly.The instructions are marginal if you need them, and some people might if they do not understand how subwoofers work. I ran a stereo mini plug from some powered altec lansing speakers with a subwoofer output to the RCA audio inputs of this unit. This was not in the instructions but works very well."
3,Nice but too boomy for my taste,"Bought this to increase the bass on my TV. It works fine. Accepts RCA cables (red/black & white cables) for audio input from your TV. If you turn up the bass volume, it becomes boomy or distorted because dialogue is sent into it. Keep the volume just high enough so that you can feel the bass but no hear dialogue through it. I give it 3 stars because, I erroneously assumed that this being an Altec Lansing, it was going to be an amazing subwoofer but I now realize this is no audiophile sub. Even when using a computer, the bass is distorted at higher volumes."

4,Queen of the Gypsies,"As with Sevilla's previous book on the life and family of Paco De Lucia, the reader of Queen of the Gypsies can gain an incredible amount of information, not only about the principle charactor Carmen Amaya, but also about the rich history of Flamenco Music. In Queen of the Gypsies there's lots of interesting anecdotes about many of the famous figures of Flamenco. Stories about Ramon Montoya, Sabicas, De Huelva, Manuel Torre, La Argentina, Pastora Imperio to name a few. This is a can't put it down for a fan of Flamenco Music, be it dance, cante or guitar. Highly recommended. J. Beazley"
1,JEAN ARTHUR FANS BEWARE!,"Please be aware that Jean Arthur is NOT in this film, IMDB does not list this as being a part of her career resume. It is Jean Carmen who stars in this film and not both actresses as the product description states. Do not buy this film on the basis that the great Miss Arhur is in it as I almost did!"
3,short - just over 11 minutes long,"Not a conventionally shaped CD. Warning label not to use in dashboard CD player. Good tunes, but very short."
3,"Nice monitor, doesn't last","When I first got this monitor, I thought it was a steal, very cheap for what you get. It has vivid color and looks very sharp at 1600x1200@85Hz, and was great for games and watching movies. It did ship with two horizontal rows of dead pixels, but they are not noticable at all unless the entire screen is displaying a constant bright color. This monitor was great, but it did not last. Less than 6 months after I purchased the monitor, it has become so blurry it's practically unusable. I had to turn my resolution down to 640x480 just to be able to see the text to write this review. The only error message I got was ""Refresh rate below recommended rate, check product manual"" however I've checked and the refresh rate is in fact still at 85Hz.I'll be purchasing a new monitor rather than having this one replaced - I doubt the next one would last very long either."
4,Just a comment about a previous reviewer,"The ""graphics professional"" who likes to run his resolution at 1280x960 to keep things ""sharp"" and is now upset that the picture doesn't stretch enough vertically to fill his monitor should be ""fired"" from his ""professional graphics positions."" My 12 year old sister knows that CRTs come in a 4:3 aspect ratio. For the mathematically impaired that means if your width is 1280, your height should be... (hang on for a second while I count with my fingers)... 1024!"
4,Straight-forward marketing explained plainly,"Spoelstra's sub-title, ""How to Market a Product Nobody Wants,"" is a bit of a misnomer. For me, that conjers up the negative stereotype of the salesman/marketer tricking you into buying something you don't want. Inside the book, Spoelstra's concept clearly is the polar opposite of that. He should have called the book, ""Making Your Product into Something People Really do Want: a Broader Definition of Marketing.""Once you're inside the book, Spoelstra presents a litiny of ideas that are obvious once presented to you, but often seem counter-inuitive without some assistance seeing them. As a marketer in a larger firm, I've run into a lot of the same resistance as Spoelstra and have found that if you can break down the resistance, his ideas really do work.Overall this is a practical guide, not just for marketers, but for anyone who runs a business. Highly recommended."
2,It is hardly a month old and it's coming apart,It is hardly one month old and the pockets on the sides have already started coming off. It is not the stuff that I expected froma brand name like Panasonic.
3,Somewhat true...,"There was a massacre at Sand Creek Colorado on Nov. 29, 1864. That is about where this 'True story' ends. The Colorado volunteers was led by Colonel John Chivington, not a Col. Iverson. The Cheyenne chiefs included Black Kettle, White Antelope, Lean Bear, Little WOlf, and Tall Bear. There was not a Cheyenne called Spotted Wolf at the camp. Peter Strauss talks about his father being killed at the Little Big Horn. That would have been difficult since Custer was fighting in the Civil War at the time, and the Little Big Horn was not til 1876. If Hollywood is going to make a movie and call it a 'true story', why is it such a problem making it really a true story."
5,Soldier Blue,"All 3 showed up in perfect order. 2 were given as gifts, both people are very pleased with DVD and did not report any problems with them. Thanks!"
2,Too little too late,"After an excruciatingly boring trek across the wilderness with C. Bergman and the other dull actor, we finally see a rather short version of America's version of genocide. The sound quality of the film is so poor, Buffy Sainte-Marie's brilliant title song is almost painful to listen to. It's also a bit different than the way she recoreded it on her albums. Buffy Sainte-Marie fans shouldn't bother with the film, as I did just to hear the song. Anyone involved in Native American rights knows the story anyway and it's not worth sitting through."
5,Soldier Blue,I got this movie for my mother for her birth day. She like it and I don't know if she watch it. I have and it very good.
3,Seems widescreen is available,"Three stars was from an earlier review before I'd seen the product (and was unsure whether it was widescreen and uncut). If I could change it, I'd give it five.I agree with those who share their frustration over improper use of aspect ratios. Luckily, the Amazon information is incorrect, and this version is in fact the full 115-minute running time and it is widescreen. The senseless destruction of the film's climactic scene has allegory of its time with My Lai, and of today with Iraq. A must-see film. Unfortunately, the promotion of this reissue seems very lackluster, thus all but ensuring its continued marginalization into the 21st century. But kudos for making the film available properly here in the States, where it most needs to be seen."
3,All I knew was Candice and Wanted to See Her.,"Candice Bergen as a young babe and she is ""hot"", innocent, but this story is terrible and not worth having to struggle through to watch Candice. Not recommended."
5,Exactly right and very quick,"I had ordered this video and requested it from the library at the same time.the purchased video came first. Very happy with the old memories, and the rapiddelivery. Thanks"
3,Soldier Blue,This movie broke ground for subsequent films in dealing with some facts that Non-Native America was not aware of. Some cheesy parts.
3,a sympathetic start for hollywood,"one of the first big hollywood movies to have some empathy for native americans. i am from a lakota reservation in south dakota and there is much to nitpick in the film, but why bother? it was a different era."
5,Soldier Blue DVD,"I searched high and low for this movie! It came quickly, and I am very happy. This is an incredible movie, and should be required viewing for all high school students. This movie is based on a true historical event... and, I loved it, but it made me ashamed of the way the ""white"" people treated the Indians. We did horrible things, and this should be a must see in History!! I would recommend this movie to anyone"
3,Soldier Blue,"One more voice against LION'S GATE release of SOLDIER BLUE in full screen instead of Panavision. They just lost another sale! Let's hope our viewer protests persuade them to put out a widescreen edition. It worked with CASTLE KEEP, let's hope it works again."
4,A Piece of History That Has Come To Life,"This movie is a gritty portrayal of what really happened in the wars between the American settlers and the native Red Indians. It was the first time I had seen the movie, my wife had seen it many years earlier and remembered it. While I generally don't enjoy movies of this type, this one because of its realism kept me engrossed and interested until the end."
1,WON'T BUY IT IN FULL SCREEN.......,I was excited when I read that Soldier Blue was being released on DVD. And then I noticed it is going to be in a Full Screen format. I will NOT buy it in Full Screen so I guess Lionsgate just lost another sale. Don't these Studios get it? If they would just look in any Walmart sell off bin they would know where the Full Screen editions go.....!
1,Save your money,"I have prior experience with ""Tactical Medicine"" through my service within the military, and as a Swat Team medic and I would have to say that there's nothing ""Tactical"" about this book whatsoever other than the picture on the cover-Save your money! It wasn't worth the hard earned money that I spent on it, Don't make the same mistake that I made and by this ""Tactical"" book!"
4,Tactical Operational Medicine,"Dr. De Lorenzo and Mr. Porter have written a very readable product on operational medicine. This is an area of medical practice that begs for more documentation, and this text is a good start. Although the information contained in the text leans heavily to the military operational side, there is a great deal of information useful to civilian Tactical services. Some of the opinions are a little controversial, but the authors take a stand and attempt to justify their opinions. Topic areas such as laser and microwave injuries are not available in other sources. The approach taken by these authors is very practical and useful from a clinical point of view. This book is a valuable addition to any emergency physician or paramedics library. I hope to see further editions with improvements."
3,Holiday Lite,"I bought this book to start getting into the holiday mood where miracles can happen. I would say that to truly believe the plotline, one has to believe in miracles. I definitely understand Lauren's wariness in trusting her kind stranger but her posturing and the way the character is described was rather unbelievable to me.The action takes place over a period of just a few days and it seems that the heroine managed to overcome her reluctance to trust amazingly fast. The descriptions of the old fashioned Christmas wonderland - Santa, sleigh rides, tree lightings, cocoa and family holiday dinners were done well and made me wish I could be there.Overall, the story was still a nice one, albeit a bit unbelievable, and it delivered a happy ending for all."
4,Great book,"This is a wonderful romantic uplifting novel about a young single mom and her daughters Christmas Wish. If your looking for something to read on a cold fall day, this is a great story."
1,Barely made it through the whole thing,"I'm sorry to say it, but I thought this was book was terrible! I barely make it through the whole book. There was absolutely no plot, unless you count the little girl wanting a dad and not having one a plot. Or maybe the plot was that her mother didn't trust people to not leave her. Either way, they were both able to overcome these ""problems"" in a matter of two seconds (yes, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but it was a pretty short time). There was a lot of repeating the main character's doubts. I don't know how many times the story had to talk about her fear of people abandoning her, but I just started skimming those parts. If you are looking for a total fluff piece, and that is perfectly fine if you are, then this is the story for you. It really just wasn't what I was hoping for and I was a little disappointed."
4,A Fantastic Holiday Book!,"This book is a fantastic, heartwarming romance book. Although somewhat predictable, the characters are endearing and I couldn't wait to read about Kyle's gentle wooing of Lauren. Add an adorable little girl and you have the formula for holiday success. If you want a Christmas tale that tugs at your heartstrings then this is the romance for you."
5,GOOD ONE,I enjoyed this book thank you. Kept my attention the entire book. Would read another by this author. happy holidays
3,Short and Sweet~,"It was a sweet story about a girl who had a baby when she was a teenager, thrown out by her parents and left on her own. She meets a rich guy who goes all out to impress her and her daughter. What I did not find believable is that they fall in love in a couple weeks time, lust maybe, but not in-love for life. The author changed his hair color, it was blonde in the beginning, then later in the book she is running her fingers through his dark hair. The ending was not a surprise, but all in all, a quick read and one I won't read again. No graphic sexual descriptions, so those who are offended by that can read this book. Can be read in a couple hours."
3,sweet story,"This one dragged on a bit too much. I could understand the female being hesitant in allowing a male into their life, but my goodness the man was absolutely begging. He knew she was the one, but even he knew that he was coming across stalker-like. His wanting to please this woman was desperate--who drags a tree up flights of stairs w/o calling first. In the beginning her car breaks down and she didn't have a cell phone. I know times were tough but you can get a cell for under $20. One of the reasons I bought this was that I thought the cover depicted an IR couple (the product details does not list as an IR--so my mistake), in fact the couple description in the story comes nowhere near the one on the cover. Overall, the story was still a sweet one and I liked the way the author finally brought them together."
2,Unimaginative,"The book is a really quick read read, but not really worth the time. The characters live in a fantasy world where dreams come true all in about five days. There is little time to bond with the characters even if you were inclined to and the plot is old and rediculous."
4,all I want for Christmas is you,Great story. Just the kind of story that gives hope to people that be live that good things can't happened to them..
5,Read it all in one evening,This was an amazing book! I just got a new kindle so I was going and downloading different books. I found this one and already knew it was going to be good just based on the synopsis. I knew that this was the first full book I wanted to read on here. I literally didn't really even want to set it down for even a second.The storyline itself is good as well as other things. I found the characters to be relatable and the overall book to be realistic. This is for sure a must read book.
3,Predictable but cute,"While the story line was mostly predictable, it was well written. Overall a cute, heartwarming, and almost hallmark-like Christmas story."
4,light romance,Cute story with a decent character building. If you want a fast read without having to invest to much time this is a good choice.
4,Thrilled,"i have not read a book like this, it had me guessing what the end was like and told my pals to read it"
2,bad book,I thought since it was Christmas time I would buy it for my kindle and read it.. This book was one of the worst book ever written.
5,Tis the season for romance!,What an incredible book! It was laugh and cry out loud amazing! The story was so sweet and lovely. I was so sad when it was over! What a wonderful Christmas romance!!
3,Typical Christmas romance,Cute but cliched Christmas story of a woman who trusts no man and the man who wants to show her not all men are bad. Can he overcome her trust issues so they can be together? I liked Lauren and Kyle. They are realistic and believable but they deserved a better story than this one. Proofreading could have been better. I was pulled out of the story over a couple of typos.
3,Charming if somewhat predictable,"The premise was charming and the character histories were interesting, even though they were eventually shoehorned into stereotypical roles, the poor working mother, the precocious child, the rich CEO with a heart of gold. It was hard to believe that they could have gone from strangers to a proposal in a week, but at least we were treated to lots of interaction between hero and heroine along the way. Still, a well-written book with writing that flows and draws you into sympathizing with the main characters and rooting for their happiness."
1,horrid,I gave it 1 bc 0 was not an option. This is so unrealistic that Snow White will start looking real. Don't waste your time with this book. No idea how it has so many 5 ratings. I read just about anything and this book is the worst book I have ever read.
2,Just Okay,"Parts of this book were very sweet. The overall feel of it was too rushed and pat for my taste though. Also, there was too much 'cutsie wootsie' and internal dialogue. The overused device of 'anguished misunderstanding' is yet another thing I absolutely do not enjoy. I found the idea that the heroine going from total distrust of people to becoming engaged in such a short amount of time, as well as the neat little wrap up of her 7 year estrangement from her parents ridiculous.This was an okay read on a cold afternoon, but I'm not sure I'd seek out other works by this author."
2,Predictable,"This was an okay read. I got this free on Amazon, so no harm done. Not sure if I will read any others. Too predictable & not enough adventure or romance for me."
2,good story,This book had a good story but I thought I was ordering a christian novel. When i came across a few swear words and then sexual descriptions I knew it wasn't a christian novel as I thought. Other than that it had a good story to it.
2,Disappointed,I liked the beginning of the story but it was obvious he was going to win her over. I gave it a two star because I was very disappointed that she couldn't wait till they married before they slept together.
3,All I want is a good romance novel,"The author does an excellent job in the first chapter to draw a beautiful and charming picture of what this story is about. A cute little girl climbs on Santa lap and tells him that all she wants for Christmas is a Daddy. Unfortunately, after the first couple of chapters the quality of writing shrinks from excellent to mediocre.If you want a quick read on a snowy winter day, go ahead, it's free on kindle."
3,all i want for christmas is you,"very good for a short story and to let you believe again in christmas, maybe a bit of more twist in between would have been good"
3,Short but sweet,"Short, a little gooey, but was a fun Saturday read. Expect a few unexpected turns and twists in this one."
3,Fast Reading,'All I Want for Christmas is You' was easy reading for passing the time. The plot was not complicated. The ending was easy to predict. Good reading while waiting for a flight or appointment.
4,First novel,"This was a great holiday story. Unfortunately, there were many errors in proofing. This is a big issue for me. It not only makes reading difficult but seems disrespectful to the author. Try this anyhow as its very good."
1,All i Want For Christmas Is You,"Just couldn't get into the story, have no idea why, perhaps I just didn't give it enough reading time, maybe at one point I can start over but I think I returned the book."
2,Couldn't get into this one...,I only read about 10% or so of the book. I felt just as a suspicious of the creepy Santa helping her in the parking lot as the main character was even though I knew that he's a wonderful rich guy who owns the mall that she's going to end up with at the end. The dialogue was painful.
4,A Heart-warming read,"I have to say I do agree with some other reviews I read concerning the editing of this book. For example, when I reached the point where Lauren ""hoped her parents were hurt"", I had to read the sentence again. Then I inserted my own words to make it make sense to me. I feel she hoped here parents were not hurt, but that's just my opinion. I felt it was a good example of how people who have been hurt and lost trust in others can mend fences and regain trust by seeing actions of other people. Kyle had to be a good man to continue to look for a relationship with Lauren when she was constantly trying (at least early in the book) to get rid of him."
5,SWEET CHRISTMAS STORY,"I really enjoyed reading this book, so sweet is this little girl. If you want a feel good book to read especially around the holidays, read this."
2,Not what I expected,"From the description, I expected a light, fun, get-me-in-the-Christmas-spirit book. It started out promising, but went downhill from there. In a matter of a few days, Lauren went from being wary and not trusting men to being completely in love and in bed with Kyle (with her daughter in the next room). The book dragged for me and wasn't hard to put down at all. In fact, I didn't finish it and deleted it from my Kindle. I love romantic happy endings so this one should have been a homerun, but it was a bit too trashy for my taste."
4,just believe...,"This was a cute holiday story complete with Santa, a damsel in distress rescued by a knight in a shining Jeep, a tree lighting on the town square, a little girl's one request for Santa and a relentless beau. This will certainly never be an epic novel but a fun read despite the spelling and grammar errors. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to others."
3,It was ok,I found myself skimming this book just to get to the end. It was okay but really didn't hold my attention.
3,All I Want For Christmas is You,"The book appears to have not been well reviewed for errors. For example, the word 'passed' was used more than once when the correct word to use was 'past'. There were instances where I'd have to read a sentence more than once because it just didn't make sense the way it was worded. But, it was a nice Christmas story...and it was a free download."
4,christmas always touches my heart,"the story line kept you intriged till the very end, a story around christmas always makes for a great story."
4,Good,"A very good holiday read.The hero was really sweet, understanding.If only in reality you could find a man like that."
4,good book,it was a cute book for the holidays. I enjoyed it . I will read other books by this author.
4,Sweet Romance!,"I read this book last Christmas and read it again this year. It is a sweet, heart warming Christmas romance. I have read other books by this author and have liked them all."
3,All I want for Christmas is You,"Very casual, light reading. Slightly entertaining. Enjoyable for the most part. Some sexual content so I wouldn't want my teenager reading it. It was a fast read and sometimes got a little long. I would recommend it for someone just laying on a beach and doesn't want to use their mind for anything but relaxing."
4,Wonderful Read!,Great romance novel for young and older readers. How the author describes the passion between he main characters will take your breath away and leave you wanting more. Once you get halfway through this book you wont be able to put it down!
4,Great book!,This book delivers a lot of punch for being a short read. The main character wants to trust people but she cannot (she has a lot of baggage). Then she finds someone who changes her mind. This book is very good and a great book for a kindle for Christmas!!!
4,Enjoyable holiday romance,"A sweet emotional love story. The author did a good job endearing the h/h to the reader. A few places were a bit fast,but that happens in short novellas. I read it in one setting last night and look forward to more of her books.I reccomed sitting down and getting in to the holiday sprit."
4,Holiday Reading,"Sweet Christmas love story. Everyone ends up happy making it a perfect holiday. Simple plot but easy holiday reading , makes the reader smile."
2,A little Christmas magic goes a long way...,"In All I Want for Christmas is You, we find the true faith of a little girl's wish for a daddy to help her mommy come true. How it gets from little Kristen sitting on Santa's lap and giving him her letter to the point where Lauren, Kristen's mommy finds that Santa REALLY can make Christmas wishes come true is a charming and heart-warming read! It doesn't hurt that ""Santa"" has the same wish for Lauren that Kristen does!"
3,All I Want for Christmas,"This is a cute, but predictable, love story set during the Christmas season. If you're into mindless entertainment, this is the book for you."
5,all i want for christmas is you,I loved the book. I couldn't read it fast enough. It took me about a week to get through the book. I loved it. Good job Lisa Mondello.
4,What a wonderful holiday story,"I just finished reading this book. I must say that Lauren is typical of nearly all women in romance books. They carry a lot of baggage into their new relationships. So what if the previous man left you. This doesn't mean the next man will. Kyle was a trooper and Kristen was an adorable child. However, as with all romance novels, the end was predictable."
4,Great Christmas book!,I was looking for a Christmas book to read to try to get me in the spirit. I loved this book! The only part I didn't like was for some reason I could never view Kyle as the attractive guy he was supposed to. I always saw him as Harry? on Dumb and Dumber... It was a great book though and I enjoyed it!
5,Another Christmas Romance--Maybe,"I read this book in an afternoon. I didn't know what to expect. It was very similar to the big movies about Santa and a little girl wanting a daddy for Christmas.This book is a little more adult in places, but had tears coming to my eyes once in a while. If you want to read a feel good book, this is a good one to read."
4,heart catching,"It was simple and sweet, not too much drama, and as with anything during the christmas season it was heartfelt"
3,Cute little story,It wasn't that great but it wasn't terrible. Good for passing some time when waiting on things to get done.
3,Nice story line,Just too much of the pathetic female act to make it ultimately believable for me. This story could have been fleshed out more
4,Review,A cute feel good holiday story... author has a ‘fun story to share that obviously was heart?warming enough to her that she had to share...riddled with a great sense of humor from the author!
4,Like a Hallmark movie,"I do not usually read romance type novels but I do like the Hallmark movies especially at Christmas time and that is just what this book brought to mind.Nothing really new in the plot, but it did use the Christmas magic idea to make three people happy: a single Mom abandoned by her father, the father of her child; a child who wants a Dad and a man who wanted someone who loved him and not just his money.If you want an easy read that gives a warm fuzzy than this is for you."
4,"Great warm and fuzzy story of Christmas, love and family","This is exactly what a good Christmas story is all about. Story begins with a little girl telling Santa what she really wants for Christmas. You will get a warm happy heart reading this story. Love, family and the wonder little Children have about Christmas - this book has it all - including a happy ending. Enjoy!"
4,Short but sweet,"I enjoyed, but was to short, and it took the author to long to make her point. I skip a lot in the book, and still knew what was going on."
4,Sappy Holiday Read,"This is the first book in the Fate With a Helping Hand series. The book opens with 6 year old Kristen asking Santa for a daddy for Christmas. Santa happens to be Kyle Preston, a very successful real estate mogul. He also happens to fall in love with Lauren, Kristen's mother. But Lauren has been hurt and estranged from her family and isn't sure she's ready to trust a man or get involved in a relationship. Luckily, Kyle is very persistent and will do anything to earn Lauren's trust. It's a pretty sappy, but enjoyable holiday read."
4,easy read.,This was a relaxing Christmas story. Enjoyed it. I like reading Christmas Stories this time of year. Don't want anything to heavy.
4,Light reading!,This book told a nice feel good story with a holiday twist and a happy ending! Upbeat and entertaining! I would be interested to read other offerings by this author.
4,"Great performance, flawed mastering","This is a terrific performance and a beautiful recording. The disc seems to have been improperly mastered, however, causing distortion at many points of peak volume levels, most noticeable with the female voices."
2,Mungo Jerry,"If you like the title cut, In the Summertime, this album has value. The other cuts on the album are garbage. Better to buy the hit single on a compilation."
3,"Nice to look at, but eh.","I thought the concept of this book sounded really cool, but the patterns themselves were nothing that I would really make like a couple of sweaters which I found ugly, a screen door (??), a knitted necklace, and paper mache crowns. The pictures were pretty, and there were a lot of valuable tips for using materials besides regular yarn to knit things with. Also, there are some cute patterns like a seat cushion cover, and some bags. Overall, I consider it an interesting resource and a pleasant read, but I wouldn't really recommend it."
4,Alterknits: Imaginative Project Creativity Exercises,"I am not a knitter (but I can dream....) This book is definitely for a more experienced knitter. HOWEVER, it is an absolutely beautiful, hip, book for anyone to look thru. The author's concept of creativity, and sharing it with others, is very inspiring. There is a complete ""glossary"" of terms in the back for the knitting challenged. Some pretty fun ideas that can probably be transfered to sewing if you're so inclined. I DEFINATELY recommend this title!"
5,irresistible for the adventurous knitter,"I LOVE this book. I got it 3 days ago & already have 2 projects started from it! The patterns are so well written; clear & concise. The photography is beautiful! And there are truly new & creative things in here!I love the creative ""exercices"" sprinkled throughout the book, like ""describe your dream knitting day"". Or my fave, is to ""write down all of things that prevent you from being creative as you want to be, put them in a bag, and throw the bag away"".It is a beautiful book that even my non-knitting friends love to flip through!"
2,Never judge a book by its cover.,"I so wanted this book to be one of those you'll cherish and treasure but it wasn't to be. I consider myself to be an intermediate knitter who loves beautiful clothes and modern fashion but I found the fashion style in this book to be 'daggy' and most suited over 40s. However, a few accessories items are beautiful and I would consider knitting them one day.To give this book a credit, its graphic design and photography are clean and modern, shame the knitting doesn't match the cosmetic look of this book. I especially love the material binding of this book which should have made this book something to treasure. I am disappointed of its content and beside one or two items, I won't be bother to look into this book again."
2,"Disappointing, But Not Without Merit!","I have been knitting for just over a year and consider myself to be of intermediate skill--I've done lace, socks, seamless garments, sweaters with significant shaping. I was hoping that this book would inspire me to strike out on my own and try writing my own patterns, or alter published patterns without fear, but I was ultimately disappointed.The knitting ""exercises"" were silly and the patterns included in the book are for the most part things that I wouldn't spend my limited knitting-time on--a knitted screen door being the best example of such. Some of the smaller items caught my eye--the photography in this book is beautiful--but I will be selling this book!"
2,not so much,"I am a huge fan of Leigh Radford and Interweave's work in general, and am all about looking for new ways of doing things. That said, this book tries to provide a new perspective on knitting, with results that range from boring to obtuse.There are a couple of projects in here that might be interesting, but for a knitter looking for new ideas, there are far better sources"
1,Does not work with Win2K OS,"It does not work with Windows 2000 and it asks for genuide.sys file. If I try to install the USB driver from the disk supplied with this kit, it gives ""file copy error"".I had to return it and bought simmiler from CompUSA and it worked with Win2K."
1,the product does not work for windows 2000,"tried it on two computers laptop and desktopused the ide drive that worksin neither case windows 2000 detects the usb drive. attempt to install driver from CD gets ""file copy eror""no information available from web site. found on the net other customers having the same problem"
1,OK...When It Worked,"Purchased this unit and installed a WD 250gb drive. Worked well for a short time. Then, I noticed that my system would intermittently remove the device, or, wouldn't recognize that the device at all. Finally, the device stopped being recognized by my system. I noticed that when it was powered on, the hard drive wouldn't spin-up. At first I assumed that the hard drive had failed. However, when I removed it from the device and used a spare connector on my system's power supply, the drive worked perfectly. Since I only used this drive for MP3 and photo backups, it was rarely powered on (maybe I actually used the device 10-15 times). It appears that the power supply circuit in the device has failed......what a piece of crap!!!"
4,Good Case but if I must Complain,"I got this case from my parents as a going off to college back up, I put a 160gb hard drive in it (which is backing up files now nicely) and over all I am very pleased with the case, the install of the hard drive seemed very easy, it's a little cramped to squeeze in but you don't want it to move around and you also don't want a large case so I'm happy with the installation. I do have some concerns as to how warm the case gets, it is a very sturdy case (that I pray will take the 4 years of college abuse it's about to receive) but the fact the hard drive itself is encased to plastic internals and there is no form of ventilation air wise through the case does make me a little cautious, on the other hand I'm going into mechanical engineering and I'd have to trust that heat dissipation issues would be working into the design of the case to begin with."
2,Keeps disconnecting from my iMac,"I bought this unit to house a 250Gb Seagate drive -- I wanted to set this up to do auto backups of my iMac. However, the unit will not stay connected to my computer for more than a day. I get this error message: ""Device Removal. The device you removed was not properly put away. Data might have been lost or damaged. Before you unplug your device, you must first select its icon in the Finder and choose Eject from the File menu"". When I power cycle the external HD, the device reattaches. Not a very good solution for automatic backups since it randomly detaches from my computer.The unit does look nice and it's an easy install."
4,Works Well,"I put a 120GB Seagate drive in this case, and it works like a charm. I like that you can swap drives and that it uses USB 2.0, which is pretty fast. I would have given this 5 stars, but I have 2 issues. The primary issue is that the data ribbon to connect to the drive is a little too long. It took me several tries to get the drive and the ribbon cable to squeeze into the case properly. The other issue, which isn't too bad, is that it does not have a fan to cool it off. This can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. Personally I would like a cooler drive, but not having a fan does keep things quiet.I would purchase another one of these over one of the ready-to-go external hard drives. Why? Because you can use just about any IDE hard drive. I got my hard drive on-sale and it cost me less than what a ready-to-go drive would. Plus I have read too many bad reviews on some of those drives. But the choice is up to you."
5,Very good eclosure,"Very good enclosure; well built; nice looking; simple HDD install. Heavy aluminum case in better than cheap ones that i've seen on eBay and elsewhere. By the way, it works fine with W2000 as well as XP."
4,Interesting read,"I learned a lot reading this book. I don't know if I agreed that plants are afraid, etc., but it was interesting to see the studies that seem to prove plants have an intelligence."
2,One part science to three parts fantasy,An interesting premise now dated and obscured among page after page of mumbo jumbo. A few good blossoms on the dunghill but by and large not a scientific approach at all. Avoid unless you have too much spare time.
1,What a waste of money!,"They had to be joking when they wrote this book. The first chapter pretends to prove plants have ESP because the needle jumps when plants are attached to lie detector machines. Then guesses are made as to what the moving needle means, such as ""plants are sentient beings, plants have emotions, and plants can read minds."" Give me a break! A lie detector measures electricity; electricity is produced as cells goes about the business of living. The authors top this off by informing us that the ""scientist"" performing these experiments offered his studies to the world for testing and replication -- in The International Journal of Parapsychology. Enough said!"
4,How can we built it easily ?,"I love this book,it shows me that internet is not the only way to communicate.Now I am looking for people able to explain me how to built the necessary materials to communicate with plants. syal@libertysurf.fr Thanks for the answers"
1,Faulty experiment,"This book seemed pretty much like a fairytale, the reason it is not accepted by the scientific community is because these experiements are full of faults. For a theory to stand the test of time and be proven, it must be attacked from every angle. These people did basic experiments giving one simple answer; plants respond to a stimuli. They just throw out a solution as to what must have caused that stimuli and never found the real reason. Futher experimentation must be conducted from all angles if these ideas are to be accepted as fact. Please further your reading into chemistry/biology and physics to understand why or why not these theories are correct/incorrect."
5,Awesome book,"I have to say, this book blows any plant book I have so far out of the water. The great thing about this book is that it will open doors to not only plants, but it will make you re-think everything. It will show you plants / animals / humans are all but one. The book goes through so many people's experiments and will challenge you to re-think everything you thought you knew about plants.The book is about plants, but it is also about life, animals, and everything in between, how were are all inter-connected....Pick it up and have a read when your ready to learn about life."
1,Funny,"This books supports the theory that plants have can mentally receive human thoughts and understand them, and it also claims there is scientific evidence for this. However, one scientist they cited, Bakster, later admitted to *never haved repeated his experiments*, thus only doing one test. That's hardly scientific. One researched cited in this book claimed that plants sulked when he insulted them. To understand this, the plant must understand English. I think people are willing to believe anything. However, of the ""successful"" experiments listed here, other scientists haven't been able to replicate these findings (which some blame on ""hostile scientists and plants who don't want to cooperate"", which is just ad hoc logic)."
5,already half way through,"i ordered this book and a dvd at the same time elsewhere, and im already halfway through the book and the dvd has yet to be opened. thanks!"
5,"Amazing, the only book I've gifted to many friends","Awesome book, very intriguing and easy to read and understand. Starts strong with fantastic research on plants and lie detector machines. Extensively researched, detailing thought provoking experiments that can be replicated at home. Changed my entire view of life, the universe and everything! Aloha"
4,Keep an open mind,"This classic is a look at the world of plants and their relationship to us, such as how plants ""think"", how they respond to music, and how they respond to being loved/being threatened. And sprinkled throughout are many lessons we can actually use in the garden.I understand why hard-core scientists don't like aspects of this book, but anyone who believes plants are sentient beings will love it."
3,I'm a believer!,"The basic premise is believeable enough to someone like me. However it tends to droll on and on. Once you get it, you're glad to know it, and grateful for the book; but after that, the author seems to spend countless pages trying to convince you of it. You'll never feel the same way about your plants again, even if you don't ""think"" you believe it ... a part of you can't help it. If you've never talked to your plants, get ready for a different kind of relationship with them..."
3,This should not be read on Kindle,"This is basically a picture book. Sweet story of the author's life remembered through her wardrobe. However, unless you can see the drawings in color and full size, it loses it's impact. This is truly one that needs the paper of a book to work!"
3,Only buy for Kindle Fire!,"The illustrations, while being colorfully described by the writer, are obviously in black and white on a Kindle that doesn't support color. I had hoped it wouldn't make a difference when I bought it on sale, but it definitely does. The book is very short, the stories don't really link together other than a common author, so the illustrations have an important role in tying the book together. If you have to gloss over them it makes the book less enjoyable."
1,Plot?,I was expecting more of a plot and a build up to the book. I often asked myself what happened here or there.
4,Very cute,I really enjoyed this book. It was cute and an interesting way to relive your younger days and remember the clothes we used to wear.
4,A GREAT LITTLE BOOK,"This little book has everything....lovely illustrations, a great story, and a completely original way of communicating to the reader. It is not really the kind of book you delve into but rather sample with little bites at a time. I love this authour because she has a completely original way of telling us about all the pain and love and loss in her life. It is one of those books that I keep handy on the shelf and bring out to the garden on my day off. Like really rich chocolate or a new summer dress, a real treat."
4,"Love, Loss, and What I Wore","My Book Group chose this book as a January read; it's short and quick and ""doable"" after the holidays. It doesn't seem like much on the surface, but it brings back memories and makes one nostalgic. The night of our early January meeting, we brought photos of ourselves in memorable outfits from the past. (The ages of our group are '50s, '60s, '70s.) We had a most wonderful time!"
2,Speed read,"Light hearted quick read, not much depth but every girl has those favorite clothes and they are tied to memories, both good and bad"
3,Book review,Good short read with some real humor. Good insights into how we relate to our clothing and times and places in our lives. A real girl book.
5,Splendid!,"I purchased Love, Loss, and What I Wore based on great word-of-mouth. It sat on my wish list for quite some time. When I finally ordered it, I must say that I was quite disappointed. Certainly, this book is not what I expected. I read the entire thing in minutes.However, as I began to read, what started out looking like a kid's book took on greater meaning. As a woman, I can recall so many special or not-so-special outfits that I wore. Because of this book, I have begun to look back on those memories and realize how so much was symbolized by my changing attire -- how clothing reflected my changes in life.As I turned the pages, I felt intimately connected with the author and all that she survived in life. She also gave me a greater insight into myself. Brilliant!Be aware that this book may not be just what you expect, but once you start reading and looking at the pictures, you will feel quite moved, as I did."
2,Did not like,"Boring but a quick read ,it's like it was written by a child. Would not recommend this book to anyone"
3,"unless it's a $1, don't bother","This reads like it was once a magazine article. It's ok, but it's not that great. It's short and written in small bursts."
3,It was different,"The pictures are in color so it wasn't fantastic on my Kindle. All I saw were hand drawn black and white images. Also, the book was super short, I read it in about 30 minutes. But it was interesting."
5,Heartache and Headbands,I love this book! What woman does not associate what she wore with the special moments in her life.Every woman should own this book!
2,"Unique idea for a book, but would not recommend","I think this is certainly a unique idea for book, but I struggled to get through the first 7-10 pages and had no desire to continue reading. Would not recommend."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this was going to be a poignant discussion detailing a trail of relationships, disappointments, greatest loves and the outfits that offer a reminder of those times. Like going through your closet and remembering what happened the last time you wore different things. This was just a basic and boring recap of a few events but not even any exciting or thrilling detail. Had to force myself to finish and plan to give it to someone older who may appreciate similar memories."
3,A bit disappointed by the lack on content,The writing wasn't great and there wasn't enough content for me. Became very boring about 1/4 the way through for me
3,"Very Quick Read, Charming Pictures","I read this on my Nexus Tablet, with the Kindle app, and the graphics displayed the pictures very well. It was a delightfully quick read, wonderfully charming. I loved the colorful pictures and the quirky way Mrs. Beckerman told the story through her clothes that she wore."
4,Good for price...,This is a good deal for the price... Great sound quality... Good design... Good for small rooms... May not be 5.1 system... Rear speakers always in low volume... Overall good for the price...
1,what's wrong with this speaker ?,"I was totally dispointed by it. The sound is so slow and left rear and right rear have no sound at all. I'm going to return it. Can I make it a little bit louder ? I think maybe my operation has problem, but I checked everything either in computer or speaker. Could you anyone let me know the truth. Tks."
4,Who needs a Boom Box?,"Weighing in at 13 pounds, this is not as ""portable"" as you might hope, but its great for the work place, and the MiniDisc features make you very popular with freinds and co-workers alike. It sounds great, especially considering its size."
4,The great CD Player,"these is one CD player you might want to get the good part is it is that it is anti skip the bad part is that it is vary expensive. its great for traval and it has a hard exoscolten body that is hard to break. Who would want to use it- Travalers, joggers, and sports men why would some one use it- It is a very high Good part - anti skip protected bad part - very exspensive"
1,expiration date of gluclose strips,"i did recieve one touch penlet plus, adjustale blood sampler with one 25 lancets-ea / but when i did open this item i found the glucose strips expired since 2007 , and more information i am ready to swear that this is the truth i need compensation for that .thanks so much"
3,Average Penlet,Was the same product that came with my meter but quality has not improved. Screwing the cap on strait requires too much attention. They should make the product with better threads to improve the usability.
2,Insufficient Spec's,"When the Vance Spice Drawer Insert arrived. I discovered that my drawers were too shallow for it to fit. Hence $13.90 wasted in shipping it to and fro. All they need to do is specify the MINIMUM drawer depth in their specifications. (Incidentally, the minimum depth seems to be about 3 and 3/4 inches."
3,Not as easy to trim as it seems,"The insert works fine,even for bigger bottles of herbs and spices (our drawer is 4 1/2 in. deep). A whole lot more cost-effective than the $75 estimate we got from the cabinet guy. However, it's not so simple to ""trim to fit."" because it is a single piece of plastic with a dozen folds, it can't be clamped to a bench, a hand jigsaw does NOT work well, it would take a table saw to do it right (I didn't want to buy a $2000 table saw just to trim my $10 drawer insert). In hindsight, a plastic cutter, a firm way to hold it in place--especially through the cuts around the ""folds""--during cutting, and a lot of patience to make the repeated scores in awkward angles would be the best way. My bottom line--unless you have access to a table jigsaw, think twice about getting this or be willing to accept a wildly ragged edge on one side of your drawer."
2,"Functional and cheap, but won't work for shallow drawers","Product was as expected: not very attractive plastic, but inexpensive so we didn't expect any more.Product is very big - not only will fit pretty wide drawers, but extends to full depth as well; good for those that have a ton of spices I guess.Our problem was that the drawer we intended to use it for is just not deep enough -- although I measured and the height of this rack insert fits within the drawer depth, I forgot to account for the additional height of spice jars when laid on the rack... Even with a small size spice jar (even the smaller size in which they are typically sold at the grocery store), the edge of its lid would not clear the drawer opening due to the steepness of the ""ramp angle"" of the trays. Oops.It's not really worth paying the postage to return it because the price was so cheap to begin with -- so oh well, not much lost. Maybe it'll find a use in my workshop..."
2,Does Not Fit All Spice Containers,"Make sure your drawer is deep enough. The drawer I put this in is 3 1/4"" deep and only the first and last ""shelves"" of this insert will hold regular size spice containers (the round glass type), no matter which way it is placed in the drawer. The middle two will only hold the rectangular tin/plastic spice containers, and only lying flat so this takes up a lot of space but you can clearly see the name of the spice. I purchased this insert for another house; it fit perfectly and held all containers so that I could arrange them alphabetically. Probably my fault for not measuring, but I was disappointed in this product."
2,Vance Spice Drawer Insert,"In the description the drawer unit is for a 19"" drawer. It is 20"" and I had to cut it down on the side and back. The size of the rows are different sizes so the spices do not sit in them evenly."
2,Awkward,"I have a pretty advanced kitchen with long wide drawers and thought this would go nicely. I found this nearly impossible to ""trim"" to fit (a little off the end length) and ended up having to use the saw feature of my small dremmel tool to get it off (it could have easily broken my scissors and given me carpal tunnel in the time it was taking me to try to cut it manually).As for fitting spices, unless you have a pretty deep drawer.. well, it fits small spices easily; but I've found the larger spice bottles bump the top of the drawer and won't let it close unless turned sideways and laid down along the ""shelving"" of the insert and can't be placed in line uniformly. And doing this takes up quite most of the space of the insert of course, so.. it's been pretty awkward to use."
2,autumn winter prep kit,I got this cause a friend said it worked in helping to keep our pond cleaned but it did nothing. The work looked just as bad as before we added it.
2,not that cute..,the shirt is ok but the skirt is weird. I don't know if it's the length and it just looks strange with her size but I never put it on her.
3,Lovely bright puzzles but quality not that great!,I love that these puzzles are so bright and colorful and thick wood but these 3 puzzles don't seem to be as good quailty as the one I already had at home. When we first unwrapped them and took the peices apart to do the puzzle the wood backing came off of many of the peices...this does not affect play really but it is a liability as I also have a 8 month old who puts everything in his mouth so of course if these peices keep falling off then I am worried he will choke on them and getting my 3 year old to keep the puzzles away from him is not easy.....I should not need to tho as the peices by themselves are not small enough to choke on anyway!
5,"A streak of the unusual, chasing the beautiful","Carolyn Fok;s CD 'projects', are not exactly made for the moment. She plays all the instruments, sound designs, engineers her albums, and uses her paintings for imagery. These 'instruments', makes for full capacity, as if never wasting one moment of these resources. Especially unique, they cut through time and place, exploring many ways that build up to a quietly owned journey filled with memories to a near-confession. The art and music, masked by the art itself, twists and turns, to new untapped forms and profound ideas where enlightenment and love is acutely embellished, and completed by deeply listening."
2,Bad Monitor and Horrid Support,I had this monitor for just 3 months before the picture would start randomly going from dark to bright. No way to fix it. I had to ship it back to NEC for 100 bucks to get a replacement. Now just a few months later the replacement is going out on me. The picture gets all distorted and rips at the top. NEC support is horrible. My only option is to spend another 100 bucks to ship this one back to NEC to get another horrible replacement. This monitor has already cost me over 400 dollars and wasn't worth half of that.
2,Good color but bad geometry,"I have owned the monitor for over a month. It has vivid color and is sharp on text. However, its geometry distortion is also terrible and cannot be resolved with all possible adjustment controls. I wouldn't recommend this product to others."
1,Black Screen - Horizontal Line in the Middle,"I have the same exact problem everybody else did!! I used it for a little over a year, it was awesome while it lasted... then I get that same problem. Black Screen , only a white horizontal line in the middle. Thats it. When you turn it on sometimes it works for like 90 seconds, and then goes bad again. It's way too much hassle to send it back, I'll just throw this in the trash and get a new one, from another brand of course.Stay away from this product."
2,Same issues...,"This monitor is absolutely beautiful cranked up to its highest resolution, with the super bright mode turned on, the picture is stunning, and the refresh rate makes it perfect for games. There is however, one drawback: It has to work to enjoy this. While I have not experienced the screen going black, it will from time to time flicker for a few moments, and the problem seems to be getting worse. I have two of these monitors set up in a dual monitor set up, the second one has worked perfectly during my 2 years of ownership, so I guess it's luck of the draw."
1,Don't buy this,"After 7 months of using this monitor, I got the same problem. The screen would turn black, with a white horizontal strip going across the center of the screen. Sometimes, it would work after I shook it a couple of times. But after a few days of doing that every 30 minutes, I decided to send it back. It costed $70 to send this heavy thing to NEC. They either repaired it, or gave me another one, so now it has no problem. Stay away from this product!!"
4,Simple but Elegant,"We are having a small wedding of just 40 people and I didn't want to spend alot on invites. These were perfect. However, we did get quite a few with some defects so if you have more then 50 people you will need to buy 2 boxes. Also, the envelopes for both invites and response cards are very flimsy and have a cheap quality to them, I suggest buying better ones at Michaels or Joanne's. Other then that my invites came out beautiful."
3,Too girly,"I thought this would be a cool anime, but in the end it was way too girly for me. It seems like the same old events happen over and over again through each episode. I sold this back on amazon right after i watched it."
3,"NICE, BUT...","THIS ITEM IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND IS VERY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. FURTHERMORE, IT LOOKS GREAT. I USED IT TO PUT PICTURE FRAMES ON. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE FINISH OF THE SHELVES. WHEN YOU TRY TO DUST THE SHELVES OR LIGHTLY CLEAN THEM, THE FINISH OF THE SHELVES SMEAR AND THE LUSTER IS RUINED. FURTHERMORE, THE SHELVES ARE EXTREMELY EASY TO SCRATCH. ONE OF THE SHELVES ON MY UNIT SCRATCHED FROM CLEANING IT WITH A DUST CLOTH. I FEEL PEOPLE WHO PURCHASE THIS UNIT WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WITH ITS UPKEEP."
3,it was ok for what i needed,slight damage to one of the shelves. but it was ok for what I needed it for. damage was toward back of shelf so no one can see it
4,"Great game, looking forward to the sequel","Ok, the graphics are choppy and obviously not too refined but then again it is a PS2 not an X-Box, so the is forgivable. The game is way too short but it very fun and the controls are intuitive and easy to use, same can be said for the ""command"" controls. Easy to get used to and excel at. The computer AI needs to be a little more realistic (not popping up in the same spot everytime)but your squads do a great job. From what I've read the sequel tweeks this and makes the game more challenging, looking forward to it"
2,make it a rental..,"Okay so I was pretty stoked to play this game so like a lemming off a cliff I ran and bought it withoutRENTING IT FIRST.Bad idea.Dumb mistake.I bought into the hype and now I'm very disappointed. Maybe it's because I'm playing on a PS2, but this game felt somehow un-finished. My biggest gripe is the squad AI: it's a bit on the weak side. When you highlight an area where you wish them to go, they only move somewhat near to it. If it happens to be nowhere near cover, too bad, they end up dying. It's pretty frustrating because you need your team mates to make it through this game.It seems as though the makers have ignored what other squad based FPS's have already accomplished, which is strange considering it's Ubi soft. I mean, look at how well Ghost Recon plays.Why couldn't this game have that kind of squad interface?I think it is very important for people to RENT THIS GAME FIRST.Sorry, but it just doesn't live up to the hype."
4,A more realistic FPS,"The first time I played this I wasn't sure if it was worth the $30 or not. The graphics are not as sharp as other FPS. Aiming is not steady. Enemies will kill you quickly. After some time playing, I started to get it. More realistic. This is not a arcade style FPS. Vision is distorted at long distances. No soldiers' hand is perfectly steady. You have to use statics in your gameplay, and use your team to accomplish the overall goal. You must use covering fire and flanking techniques, as well as survey the battefield for enemies and use cover to take them out. If you like more of the run and gun FPS games, stay away from this one. If you like FPSs, but want something a little more realistic, this is a pretty good choice."
3,The Game Is Okay,"When I first saw this game I thought it was really cool. I saw it on tv. I bought it and I played it and I didnt really like it. The two player mode is not so good because you cannot work in cooperation you have to kill eachother. Another thing about the 2player thing is that you cannot have a co-op story mode. The story is really hard, even if you put it on the easy level. Maybe thats my opinion becuase im not such a ww2 game player. The missions are really hard for me. I think it is a waste of money. The graphics are great though. The game also has a lot of cursing and bloody images."
2,waste of money----even if you rent the game for 5 bucks,"This game is way to short. Its only 14 missions long and each mission takes about 10-15 minutes (for me anyway). The shotting is impossible from far away with a automatic or a rifle. The enemies are smarter than your guys by a long shot. Your guys get them selves killed only taking on one german. If you get shot your gun shakes and its impossible to shoot someone that is even one foot infront of you. The game is fun and I enjoyed playing it, but i couldnt enjoy myself for long becuase I finished the game before i could one glass of milk that I was drinking before i started to play the game. I gave it bad reviews because it deserved it."
3,Get it on X-box,"Everything about the Ps2 versian sucks. Graphics,gameplay, everything. Don't bother buying unless you have an x-box."
2,not pleased,I was not pleased with the print. Looked like it came from a mimeograph... those who remember them. The content was rambling. I expected a more coherent story. I would not suggest purchasing this item. A lot of money for a poor product.
2,Logical positivism only,"By error I bought this expecting it to be a history of Positivism in general, but found its focus much too narrow."
4,Love it!,"I have to say, when I got this little jacket for Christmas, I fell in love with it! It's a very nice jacket which can be worn for work or just going out. The string for the corset in the back are a bit long, but you can always cut them and then super glue the ends. Bottom line, this is a perfect, well made jacket."
1,Mr. Parrish should get his facts straight!,I have read a few of Mr. Parrishs' book including the jeanette macdonald story. Somehow he misses the boat on the true story and that her marriage to Mr. Raymond was a sham! The tearing apart of Mr. Eddy was totally wrong and misdirected! Mr. Parish I read 2 of the books you have out and this will be my last!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a red light warning to anyone who is thinking about doing business with the seller 'RAREWAVES-USA'. I ordered the DVD entitled 'The Doobie Brothers: Live at Wolf Trap'. The DVD would not work in either of my DVD players and I have never had a problem with them before. The problem is with the DVD. Another reviewer reported having the same problem. I emailed these people to see if I could return the DVD and exchange it with one that would work, but they refused to even consider this. This is an outfit that puts their own profit above being fair to the consumer . I will never do business with them again, and I strongly suggest that anyone reading this do likewise. You will lose your money with no recourse. Folks like this should be put out of business."
1,doobie brothers live at wolf trap,This dvd will not play in any dvd player I own. I have 4. I have misplaced the paperwork so can't return it but it's useless to me.
2,Had potential,"Yes, there are a lot of movies listed here. The most helpful thing is the re-titlings. However, I have gone through my copy several times, and I have watched well over 600 horror, scifi, and fantasy films and shows, and I found this book riddled with mistakes. The author misspells names of actors, lists the wrong actors, and in some instances, has problems with genders in movies, i.e. saying a woman was drilled in the head when it was a man, etc. And leaving a review of Transformers the Movie out of his book is unforgivable. Maybe it will be in the reprints."
3,Please give us a TRUE HORROR fan to write these books,HOW CAN YOU AGREE WITH THIS GUYS REVIEWS WHEN HE GIVES 4 AND 5 STARS TO CHIDREN OF THE CORN SEQUALS?
4,book comes in handy,I found this book very useful. I wouldn't go by the authors rating of the movies since eveyone has different taste in what they might find a great movie to be. I did enjoy reading his reviews for some humor though but definatly wouldn't agree with. This book however is a great way to find movies you probably haven't heard of or forgot about. I would recommend having this book for reference only not reviews. I use mine to keep track of movies I would like to find and movies I already have.
5,Informed Study for Strict Theological Truth,"I am very satisfied with this product. I am a very serious Christian & this information in my opinion, is a needed source for serious study in Apologetic Theology & the understanding of being a follower of Christ!!! I highly reccomend this to anyone who wants to study scripture thoroughly & accurately! Part of my ministry is passing on information about the only truth, The Bible, I have purchased copies of this CD for other people because it affected my own study so deeply!"
3,"Dipole antennas work great, but...","You will have a hard time improving on the performance of a wire loop or dipole antenna, so you do not need to spend much to obtain an excellent antenna. What you may get with the expense of an indoor amplified antenna is a more convenient antenna that does not take up the space of the wire and can be more easily reoriented. The included amplifiers are intended to compensate for the inferior performance. Adjust your expectations."
1,No help at all,"A simple drop down wire antenna supplied with my Polk radio does a better job than this amplified antenna. I spent a good hour trying various locations, placements and wire separations, all to no avail. An old boom box radio with a stick antenna picks up the signals better than this does.As others have said, why would this company sell such a product?"
1,TERK ANTENNA,ITS A PIECE OF JUNK. I ADDED A LENGHT OF WIRE TO EXTEND IT CLOSE TO A WINDOW TO GET THE BEST RECEPTION. I GOT DECENT RECEPTION BEFORE I AUCTUALLY MADE THE CONNECTION. AFTER THE CONNECTION I COULD NOT GET THE RECEPTION THAT I GOT WITH THE PLAIN PIECE OF WIRE. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE
2,Not very impressed,"Expected a moderate signal increase but it was only minor. But I may be in a bad signal area, it just didnt do the trick for me."
5,As advertised. pricey.,"This is a good antennae for FM not so good for AM. But who listens to AM anymore? Would be especially good for someone with a tuner that lives in a major metropolitan area with tons of stations on top of each other. The friend I bought this for is just that person, he loves it."
2,"Eh, not so much","The antenna looks nice, is well made and it did improve my reception just a little bit. However, for the money spent, I did not get the improvement I was looking for. Although I'm right downtown perhaps it's the building that I'm in. I don't know, but I can't recommend this product."
1,save your money,Connecting the signal amplifier added background hiss--and it still didn't work as well as rabbit ears I got at a 99-cent store.
1,"If I could rate 0, I would.","Made absolutely no difference vs. the factory supplied antenna. In fact once I moved the factory supplied wire a bit, the reception was better than with this product. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have, since it is not worth one star."
1,Not much use in Ottawa ont Canada,I hooked this FM antenna up in place of a single wire for Fm and found the new Terk next to useless for FM stations. With the Terk hooked up I got less stations and more noise than before. For my location I would recommend - don't bother!!!!
2,Terk Amplified Indoor AM/FM Antenna,"Review for ""Trek Amplified Indoor AM/FM Antenna""I bought this antenna few weeks ago was intaled by an expert but... this antenna DOSN'T WORK at all no matter how or where you put it to localize the direction of the waves.Let me know if i can returned without the box.Thanks;Lydia Cruz."
4,Terk Amplified Indoor AM/FM antenna PIB,"Received the antenna in the mail a few days ago. setting it up was easy, turned it on and played with the Gain dial, and the static of some of the FM stations that I receive is now gone. So works as advertised, even though I had to turn it and play around with it to position it properly.The only thing that I wished it had, is an on/off switch, as the antenna is plugged in to power and into the antenna plug that goes into the radio at all times.All in all, works."
3,Good for a starter set??,"We bought this set for our 20 year old daughters first apartment. It arrived with a cracked handle on one pan, and a lid with a bent rim on another. Amazon promptly shipped her another set. I hope this lasts a little longer than I think it will, but it seems cheaply made and wouldn't be a great deal who cooks extensively."
1,Won't fit 2002 Ram 2500,"Be aware that this will not fit a Dodge Ram 2500 even though Amazon site tells you it will. This is a common problem I run into all the time. The 2002 Ram 1500 was a completely new body style and the 2002 Ram 2500 was the old body style held over from 2001. So, if you are ordering parts for a 2002 Ram 2500, order parts for 2001 Ram 2500 on Amazon.com because they have it wrong."
2,Less Money and No More Hair,"I didn't much expect Advecia would do much. So I wasn't much surprised when, in fact, it did not. No doubt, I made too many reorders of Advecia when I should have realized sooner that just squirting a liquid on my skull was not going to make any dormant follicles take notice. If other guys actually got some benefit from Advecia, I am glad for them. Of course, I would actually like to meet someone like that to be sure he doesn't have stock in the company."
2,Not good.,"I took this supplement for 2 yrs and did not notice new hair growth. My hair loss is upfront , not in back. I think it stopped my existing hair from falling out but no new growth. Wasnt happy with product."
4,This stuff works but only if you take it uninterrupted,"If you take this every single day (2 in the morning; 2 at night) it absolutely works!! At least it has for me. I've been taking Advecia for almost 2 years now. Not only did my hair stop falling out but it has filled back in almost completely. To clarify, I was not fully bald but my hair was really thinning in the back. I also learned the hard way that if you fail to take Advecia for even a week, you stand to lose all the progress and hair re-growth you experienced prior. So time your orders of new bottles accordingly. It took a couple of months but most of the hair I lost during that week I was in between bottle orders did grow back!Conclusion: Use Advecia faithfully, uninterrupted, and it DOES WORK."
1,What a sham.,"Sorry to see this, because Dare Wright's book are so exquisite. This is some really insensitive exploitation with no flavor of the books to which it refers...I will treasure my entire collection of the real thing."
2,Kronks New Groove Region Code Error,"I would have rated it higher but I cannot play it on one of my DVDs because it comes up with an error ""REGION CODE ERROR"". As I don't know how to get rid of the error because I do not know the region code it makes it inconvenient to watch it.Kronk's New Groove"
3,Just OK,"I wasn't expecting much from this sequal and Disney gave me what I was expecting. It's a decent story, but not great. Has a few funny parts. I wouldn't recommend buying this for any kid over 10. Also, it had at least 2 inappropriate sexual suggestive lines. Kronk told the evil woman that he had a proposition for her- she looks at him as if she's excited to hear that- then he says ""not that kind of proposition"". What the hell are the writers at Disney thinking putting that in a Disney animated movie??? I rented this, and since they want to put sex in kids' movies now, I won't be buying it. I can't recall the other sexual innuendo, but it was worse than the one above."
2,Its no Emperor's New Grove...,Just got done watching this movie and it has a few funny parts but its got nothing on the first movie... The plots thin but I can see kids would like it... Just dont think that its a Shrek 2 type of sequel its more of a Lion King 2 movie...
5,Good clean fun!,"Great sequel to The Emperor's New Groove. Wonderful family movie with Grown-up humor too! Everyone in the family can enjoy this movie. This movie, like its predecessor has a moral the children can pick up on as well as comically and musically entertaining. If you liked the Emporer's New Groove...you'll equally love Kronk's! B"
3,Some what Funny...but confussing,"Kronk's new groove has a lot of stuff that works, and a lot of stuff that dosen't.WorksEzma and Kronk stuff is really funnyALL orginal actors are back, Goodman, Spade, Kitt they are all there.Good message, you just have to be yourself.Doesn't workThere are A LOT of flashbacks. There are even flashbacks in flashbacks!!Not enough EzmaNot enough Kuzco(these two made ENG so funny)Birdseye(Kronk's girl) was annoyingBoring at times"
4,"A good sequel, especially for Disney","My family and I loved the Emperor's New Groove, and our favorite part was Kronk, so when Kronk's New Groove came out it was met with equal parts anticipation and dread. Anticipation for obvious reasons, but dread due to Disney's love for half-baked straight to video sequels that aren't worthy of being in the same area code as the original.Kronk's New Groove is a great movie, holding to the same light-hearted fun as the first, if not being quite at the same budget, which shows a little. But Kronk's Groove holds some of the same great characters while introducing a few more. I must admit, I was fearful of what politically correct love-interest they would bring out for Kronk, but Miss Birdwell was refreshingly not any expected stereotype. The movie, if a bit predictable, was great fun, and highly recommended, especially if you loved Kronk from the first one."
4,A Fun Sequel,"Kronk's New Grove is a really fun movie, especially if you are a fan of Kronk and Patrick Warburton. It may not be as good as the original movie, but it is still funny and was able to get the actors from the original movie to return. This movie also had a great soundtrack that worked for the movie. Overall, the movie is worth seeing if you are a fan."
2,Nothing New About This Groove,"If you've seen The Emporer's New Groove then you have practically seen all this ""New"" groove has to offer. There's hardly a new idea to be found. Almost all of the one-liners and visual gags are taken directly from the previous film. Rolling film stock, interruptions in the story by characters who make comments to the audience, even the ""pull the lever"" joke is repeated, and it was it was used twice in the original film!That said, young kids will probably be taken in by the vivid colors and frenetic action. It's mindless entertainment with no heart that manages to talk down to everyone over the age of 8. This groove may have no hope of being anyone's favorite animated film but at elast it offers a chuckle or two."
2,Could have been lived without.,"Really, it's a horrible film. I loved Lilo and Stitch 2 Stitch has a glitch, but this? Valiants better, thrash this, due to its lack of Pacha, Kuzco and nothing that made the original the best comedy of 2000."
3,Loses steam,"This sequel is great in the begining, but gets kinda boring after a while. The plot is a little simple and short. The jokes are the best part and will make you laugh. Though not as good as the original, it's still entertaining."
2,Rent Before You Buy,"Just a warning...don't buy this movie until you've watched it. It is definitely not good enough to spend $20 on. There were a few funny parts, but like many Disney sequels, it was seriously lacking in the ""Interesting"" department."
2,Falls apart,"While a good idea, the truck is poorly made. The truck pieces that hook together fall apart whenever my 4-yr. old son tries to roll it across the floor, and he ends up very frustrated. I ordered a replacement for it, thinking we just had a defective one, but the new one has the exact same problems. You're better off spending your money on something else."
1,Did They Consider Bebe?,"When this album was first released with the single, ""Not Natural"" I wondered if Angie & Debbie recieved any advisement from the family as to whether such a song was a wise choice. Clearly it wasn't. Now I wonder if these women had knowledge of their brother Bebe's struggle with his own sexuality and if they stupidly wrote this song in the name of standing up for ""holiness"". The church has alot of soul searching & maturing to do concerning the issue of homosexuality. God's people need to close their mouths on this subject and ernestly seek God's face for His wisdom and understanding."
1,Haters,All I can say is that they are two women contributing to homophobia in the black church. I love Bebe and Cece but will keep steppin' when it comes to their sisters. Cast the first stone.
1,"Cheap, bigoted drivel","It is sad that African Americans would distribute such bigoted ""music,"" attempting to couch its ugliness by proclaiming that they're only trying to ""help the world."" The Winans should be deeply shamed by their bigotry and narrowmindedness on this album. Gospel should be about building people up and reinforcing community; not shunning and damning people as ""unnatural."" Angie and Debbie Winans: shame on you. You'll have to answer to a higher power one day and have to explain your hatred."
5,I'll buy it,"And honestly, from listening to the samples I'm not crazy about the sound of it, but I'll buy it simply because I support the truth of God's Word. The young ladies are simply singing the Bible. Those who like it, like it. Those who don't, don't. Amazing how people don't tend to have a problem with God until He tells them something they don't wanna hear. Doesn't make it any less true, though. I applaud your boldness, Angie and Debbie. They hated Jesus for telling the truth, too."
5,The Truth,Angie and Debbie are only speaking the truth on this cd!There are a lot of things going on in the world now that they speak abouton this CD. I don't know if you can count on a current musician to speak out in this way...
5,Glover's Marblehead Regiment,A comprehensive history of a small New England town with an enormous contribution to American history. Thank the Almighty for the likes of John Glover and his Marblehead Regiment!
4,Puppies!,"My son bought this toy to participate in a gift exchange at school, for a girl who LOVES dogs. It was an excellent gift for a 3rd grader (they love small things!) who adores all kinds of dogs and not just a specific breed. Because of the reasonable price, we were able to get her a few other small items, as well. We're very pleased with our purchase."
2,Better collections out there,This dog collection is much smaller in size than I expected. There are other plastic dog collections out there that offer a figure size a bit bigger with more attention to detail on each dog. Not worth the $[...].
3,An unusual story about a young girl who is trying...,"She is trying to learn how to understand what's going on aroundher, and trying to find out why people are the way they are, andtrying to get through the problems that she has to face. Andshe has to face many problems and many things that she doesn'treally understand. Katie Marie discovers a website devoted toSt. Therese, and she writes about how things are going and aboutsometimes needing help. She asks Therese to send roses. And shewrites about the things that she learns as she muddles throughlife - rather like most of us seem to muddle through life."
4,extraordinary fascist wish fulfillment,"This is an amazing film, which should be viewed by every history student. Made shortly after the Crash, this film glorifies a despotic (and angel anointed) presidency that uses military might to further seemingly reasonable goals. And sure enough, the wish was granted in the election of an imperial president who ruled for 4 terms, tempered only by the checks and balances of the constitution. An remarkable example of the ability of cinema to tap into the dark dreams of a nation in crisis."
4,Blowing Gabriel's Horn,"""Gabriel Over the White House"" is a political progressive's dream come true ... and, just imagine, it's been sitting around for more than 75 years with scarcely anyone paying attention to its message. It may be a 75-year-old movie, but what it has to tell us about forging a true democracy is as contemporary as can be!"
1,Conservative/Religious Right/Fascist Wet Dream,"This movie, despite its often hilarious moments (that are usually unintentional), serves well as a serious fantasy about what the consequences would be of having a President who was fundamentalist, born-again, and power hungry, and who would not stop at his attempts to seize total authority until he was running the country the way he wanted to. Wait, no, sorry, this isn't about the current president, this movie is from 1933.But, how prophetic! One of the many ironies in the film is that the horn motif that shows up during the moments of ""divine intervention"" was lifted from the last movement of Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 1 in C Minor. Brahms himself lifted it from a Swiss alphorn player. It's from a piece called ""High on the Mountain"" and is an alphorn melody that Brahms heard while hiking in the Rigi area of Switzerland. The irony here is that Brahms was a noted agnostic.In sum a mixed bag, fun to watch, but also a little scary.[...]"
5,3 Ninjas,"I watched this movie several times as a child. When I realized I only had it on VHS, I knew it was time to look for it on DVD on Amazon. This is a great family movie."
3,Be Careful... Look at it Carefully,The 3 ninjas bundle deceives... and you'll understand why if you know all the 3 ninjas movies that were made...
2,Probably the worst film I've ever seen.,"I saw this movie for the first time several months ago. The only reason I actually watched it is because my friend had two valid points - there was one hilarious part, and it had the word ""'za"" in it.The only reason I've given this film 2 stars instead of one is because of the scene where the door slams in the kidnappers face. That is probably the funniest scene in the movie.3 Ninjas is full of horrible jokes and bad action sequences. Just when I was starting to take them seriously, the Grandpa names the kid ""Tum-Tum"". Ancient ninja warrior, Tum-Tum!The ending is the worst. I don't want to ruin it for you.Finally: The DVD. It has nothing on it, save the movie. I wanted to see something - behind the scenes, trailers, I don't know. If you really want the movie, buy the VHS."
5,Loved the move,"it was a great price for the movie and the price was great. It came in fast by mail, and worked great."
5,Very funny,"My kids thought it was really hysterical, they were laughing out loud , from ages four to fifteen year olds"
4,Satisfied,"My nephew was thrilled with the movie, and so was I. It was in great quality just like I was expecting."
5,Hero Kids,I always enjoy movies where kids are the hero's. It is very entertaining and brings out some good points about raising kids.
3,3 ninjas,I didn't actually by this for myself but it was a oldie favorite of a really old friend. It got here very speedy though. That was great.
3,canciones argentinas,"Very classic in both counts lyrics and music, I was expecting something more contemporaneous."
2,"Might work some, not all!!",2 stars for looks. Might work for some but not for me. This worked for my VCR and DVD. TV and stereo no luck. After that I didn't want to try it on my cable box. I was about to break it after fifteen minutes of use. No backlit buttons and too many of them.
3,"If you need the codes, I have them.","Another reviewer offered the setup codes for this unit but wouldn't answer e-mail so I ended up buying one just to get them for the one I already owned. It would be my pleasure to give them to anyone who needs them. E-mail me at waynenorth44001@comcast.net and I will send you a copy. If you are looking for them anywhere else, give up. If you have an Apex tv, use the Toshiba codes."
1,Easy to break into,I saw someone break into that lock using a bic pen. Check it out on [...] it's crazy. I just had my scooter stolen. Kryptonite is a scam.
5,Beautiful heart shaped ruby cubic zirconia earrings!,These are a perfect sized stud earrings. The ruby cubic zirconia is very close to the real thing.
4,enjoy with tequila,"This veteran master sets an undeniable groove with every style he plays. I first got hooked on the ballad, I Will Be Standing. Then the rest of the tunes just got absorbed through my pores like west Texas dust. Definitely enjoy with your favorite tequila."
2,Frustrating,"I bought this game mainly for the legacy mode. Compared to last year, this game is almost a carbon copy in that regard, as are the graphics and sounds. There are no new features worth mentioning. Simulation is very bad (worse than last years game), as the ball seems to be coated with jelly. Teams turn over the ball ridiculous amount of times, averaging about 80 turnovers in a game between two teams! Every fast break resulted in a turnover as the computer would try to pass the ball full court which ends up being stolen and then re-stolen. Even simple short passes a few feet away ends up being fumbled and stolen. So if you are mainly buying this game for the legacy mode and prefer to simulate your games, then you should stick with last years edition and save $20."
1,Worst b-ball game ever... seriously.,"i didnt purchase 2k6 last year, but this year i decided to pick up 2k7, having seen a duke player on the cover and thinking that the rosters contained actual college players. well, i was wrong. the players are all computer generated, which i dont mind as much as the gameplay. almost EVERY pass ends up being stolen, i mean, there are like 50 turnovers every game, all because of the steal. A long pass cant be thrown without being stolen. and then the legacy mode is something that confused me. I dont know how to recruit and stuff, so it gets frustrating.not worth the money."
4,Authentic and thrilling,"This collection of traditional music from several South and Central American Spanish speaking countries including Venezuela, Peru, and Mexico is as grassroots as you can get.The handpicked best that each of these cultures had to offer, but none of it is cliche. You walk away appreciating that there is so much greater, musically, in Latin America than we are led to believe by the major record companies.Your money is well spent here."
1,This company is run by a thief.,"These people are liars and thieves. They did not return calls placed over a 3 month period. When some guy named Chris finally did answer the phone, and I explained to him that I had been leaving messages for months, he told me to return the product immediately, which I did. He even looked my information up on the computer so he knew exactly when I received the product. They received the product back on April 14--signed for in their office by S. Johnson. The next correspondence I received was an e-mail telling me that they would not refund my money even after telling me to return the product. They are liars and thieves."
2,No change in skin condition.,"I did not find any changes with this product. It is so expensive that it isrecommended that you not use a lot. Consequently, it does not evengive any lubricant. I have used it for a month, now, and do not see thatit does anything."
3,Not convinced,"I've started my 2nd tube, and I'm not so sure it is making any difference. Maybe I'll stop for a while and then see if there really is a difference."
3,Nothing special,Three stars for being a decent moisturizer. That's all. Saw absolutely no difference in my skin. Purchases primarily for my eyes but used it according to directions. Nothing special and a very pricely auto ship plan.
3,wrinkles smoother,"I can't yet give this cream a five until I've used it for a while. I used it before a big party the other night and again last night and did not see any differences, but maybe it takes a bit of time. We'll see, then I can come back and be able to review it better."
3,Olympus Camedia lens adapter,"I don't use it much but it does allow me to use the extra lenses that went with a much larger SLR camera.Worth buying if you need to use a larger lens than is on the camera.Mine is an Olympus Camedia C 765 Ultra Zoom, an older one with 10 X zoom. I love it. Birds in tree tops look like they are 10 feet away.Annie"
3,Slightly disappointed,"The CLA-4 Lens Adapter Tube seems very difficult to position so it will thread straight into the lens barrel. I lose a lot of time getting it positioned just exactly right. Other than that, it is fine - it fits the camera and the telephoto lens and seems to hold the rather heavy lens quite securely once it is properly positioned."
4,OP Juice,"I really like this cologne. The size is a little small, making the purchase a little pricey. All-in-all, I'm pleased."
4,Good for the price paid,"It's a good concert for the $3.00 that I paid. It can serve as some good entertainment the first couple times you watch it, but it will eventually get old. I've now found that I should stick to Slightly Stoopid's recorded stuff, as they're not quite as good in concert. Nevertheless, it was fun to watch."
4,Good Thermostat but the seller shipped it in horrible packaging.,I needed a thermostat to figure out what was wrong with my truck. It was in a blister packed package for hanging on a shelf in a store. I was surprised when I received this because the package was so faded I could barely read it. It was all stapled together to hold the thermostat in place and the package was covered in black dust. It looked like it had been hanging in a shop window for 100 years. I really didn't care that the package was messed up. But the metal around the dial had a dent in it. I used it anyway and hoped the dent would not affect it's performance. It seemed to be fine.So the Thermostat is a good thermostat. I was just disappointed in the seller for sending out something in such horrible condition. If you need a thermostat this brand is a good one.
4,Good player.,"Very good DVD/CD player, exellent optical digital audio output; is working great with my Clarion DVH-940 multichannel processor. It's only drawback is that doesn't work well with computer burned DVD's."
3,It's okay!,"Bought this for my old Konica camera, only to find out my camera was shot, so bought a new camera and in all fairness, this battery would probably work fine if the camera worked."
5,Works like a charm,This cable fits several of my cameras and video cameras and works like a charm. Will do business with this vendor again!
5,Excelent.,"This is an awesome book on Native American healing. I would recommend this to anyone of a Shamanic leaning, or to someone who seeks to learn more about Earth-based, Native spirituality.This is brilliant, and a must for any spiritual person's library.~OakRaven~"
5,Great Native American Overview,"I enjoyed reading this book, for it delivers on several levels. Not just a book about healing methods, it delves into the Native American culture in depth. Details about traditional life, customs, and ways of looking at the world are all woven into the chapters. Great philosophy for modern Americans, Native or not."
3,Great information; just hard to read through,"Ken Cohen is full of wisdom and knowledge of Native American medicine, which is evident from reading this book. However, it seems to me that writing is not his strength.The book does not flow very well, it randomly jumps around, and it is irritating to constantly be interrupted with a Native American word or phrase followed by the definition. His style of writing disrupts the flow of the book. Please, just use the term in the language the book is written in so that I don't have to be plagued with a vocabulary lesson every other paragraph.The information is great. It really is. It just feels like I am having to drill through rocks to get to the diamond within as I read about random visions, poetry, and so on.I do recommend this book for reference, but I think he should have had either a more experienced editor comb through it or hired a professional writer."
4,"""Christmas Story"" by James Marlin is a REAL Present",I truly enjoyed this CD. If you are a person that prefers Christmas orchestra music over 'singing carols' this cd will surely satisfy you. The music is relaxing but still keeps you in the holiday spirit. James Marlin's music was introduced to me via a promotion and I have since purchased a few of his CD's. Looking forward to purchasing more.
3,Plenty of sex and violence,"This anthology centers on sex and violence. Most of the contributions are new stories that heat up the pages with torrid sex scenes. Although the authors are excellent writers, the basic flaw in this collection is that the short format does not lend itself to scorching bedroom scenes and a powerful mystery plot. FLESH AND BLOOD: EROTIC TALES OF CRIME AND PASSION contains well-written tales, but leans too heavily on the erotica at the expense of the mystery, leaving the audience to wonder who done it?Harriet Klausner"
3,Very good perfromace... until mysterious death,"This modem died after just under 4 months of use.It is a bit tricky to configure. Also you have to install software on the computer you plug directly to the moden by LAN cable to configure it(which i think is ridiulous for a modem router). But once done, it performed very well..It demise came in the form of sudden continuous and simultaneously flashing USB and ADSL lights... Link lights won't light up when a cable is plugged in... not even pressing the reset button or unplug/replug the power adapter helped. Its doom was confirmed by live support from zoom.comI'm not sure i'd by zoom again. The configuration hitch, its rather tough interface and its short lifespan are too much for me."
3,Varies,"Most of these tunes aren't worth listening to, but some are amongst the best West Coast Gangster Rap tunes I've heard. Had Daz kept them his new solo album he could have produced a classic. Hey Hoo is produced by LT Hutton, OG 2 Me by Mike Dean and Why oh why by Warren G. Daz should get more producers to work on his albums. He is one of the best producers about but could do so much more with a bit more variety."
1,Daz at his worst,"I can't believe Daz, this is his worst stuff. When I first bought this CD I was expecting some new work from his crew but it was all old work he did with other artist. None of these songs are of his own, he is featered on all of the songs. He pretty much borrowed these songs from the artist that originaly released them. Come on he has J-LO, IMX, USHER & SOMETHING 4 DA PEOPLE on this album. A true Daz Dillinger fan would speak the truth, and thats what I'm doing. Who ever gave this a good review is a Daz groupie. The only thing that is good, is that Daz is making money off of other artist's work. He got paid to do these songs and is getting paid to release them. It's nuttin' to a BOSS! -Don Juan from The Stack, California"
4,Good Album,"If you are a fan of Daz or West Coast music then get the album. 2 discs of quality music. There are a few filler tracks but thats a minor problem. Favorite tracks: Put Tha Monkey In It, Why Oh Why and Crippin'. Definently check it out.DPG4Life"
4,should be rated R,"Crying Freeman is great for those was like sex,blood and violence, which is some of the reasons i like it. joke :). The series is really hard to understand you have to be carefully watching to understand the plot but at the same time it's a good anime. In the end it's all about power, and you even hear actual gang names like the the Japanese Yazuka, the Italian Mafia and lots more. i would recommend buying it."
3,Crying Freeman the Complete Collection,Story wise this is pretty weak but if all you really want is some old skool violence then this is perfect. There's a bit of sex and lots of nudity (the main male character and all the females always find some excuse to strip off). Being an OVA the animation is also reasonable. So just swtich off your brain and enjoy this good old fashioned 90's anime.
1,overrated,"Ian Page was way too into himself and overrated. Secret Affair was just a plain ol' mediocre band that jumped on the mod revival bandwagon like all the other bands of the time. Time For Action was really the only palatable tune they had. If you're into the mod scene, try to find this used. Spend your money on something more worthwile like anything by the Jam, the Chords, early Purple Hearts, Squire and anything Stax."
5,Great case especially with the Porter rolling cart,"This is a pretty sturdy case that keeps everything inside secure with heavy lockable latches. I would recommend either the wheeled version of this case, or buying this model along with the rolling Porter carry-on style case (I think it is the Porter II series). This fits perfectly on top of the rolling Porter cart case and it is a dream to travel with this combination."
3,CAUTION!,"This device requires a 12 VDC power source to run and does not come equipped with a working one! It is packaged with a cable with one end that fits into the device and the other end is open wire! I looked and looked on this site and I cannot find ONE PLACE where it says anything about this - or even not coming with a power source. Luckily this is not that big of a deal as you can use any old 12 Volt power supply, but it is definitely irritating that this device requires a part with which it is not supplied. Radio Shack has one for cheaper and it comes with a power source.It appears as though the device was meant to be used in an SUV or something (for TV monitors), but again it doesn't mention this in the ad.Otherwise, works great."
5,great for kids,this silverware was a big hit at Gramma's house for my 3 and 4 year olds. they feel grown up and yet the silverware fits their hands. I would reccommend it highly
3,Cute...and fun,I bought these for my 15 month old daughter. She seems to like them. They have large enough handles for her to hold on to at her current age. She will be able to use these for at least another year. It makes eating a little more fun...never a bad thing!
1,Aaaargh...no stars for you!,"Okay, so the outside is really durable, and the strap is certainly handy...but two minutes ago I opened the case up for the first time since buying and loading it up last night...and the plastic sleeves were tearing open!I mean, it's not like I have abnormally fat CDs or something.We're not talking little rips right near the finger tabs...these sleeves won't hold in the CDs anymore. I want my money back."
3,Memorable from our live Mall experience years ago.,we paid a lot for this tape ($39 was best price) considering the age of the IMAX film. It was not the show we most remembered but well done for its time. Not worth the money we paid however considering more modern flying media available today. Maybe a collector item?
2,250 external zip drive,"It showed an installment disk in the picture but there was not one with it. It did not work for me, Linda"
3,Not Durable,"My son really got into Hi-5 so I bought the dvd's for him to watch whenever he wanted. It came with 3 discs and worked perfectly for alittle while. I didn't let him touch the dvd's but somehow they didn't hold up. They skip all the time and it's annoying and disappointing since I spent money on it. There are hardly any scratches on it and it skips, so I bought something to clean the back and it still doesn't work."
1,Ironing Pad/Cover is Incorrectly Described,"The pad sent to me did not match the description or photo. The neck on the pad is very narrow. The photograph depicts a different type of ironing board than the one the cover actually fits. I bought two of these and had to return them both as they did not fit the board. I was stuck paying the shipping, thus penalizing me for a product that was misrepresented."
2,I feel like someone is playing with me,After reading this book I was feeling like someone wanted to make me angry. Breast cancer is a very delicate issue to my family so I decided to write my opinion. This book turned out not to be helpful as I hoped it could be. Anyhow I found another book God's Medicine Is Best by L. Wise and believe it or not the remedy I found there... good luck!
1,New agey nonsense,"My wife was given this for free. Her mom died of breast cancer. We care about this issue.I was dismayed by the book's regular ""this is good for that"" medical advice. Let's say I'd like to see a little more proof, for example, that a coffee enema is good for liver detoxification. And that detoxification should be done at change of seasons. What? I have a phd in a hard science, so my standards of proof are a bit high.Simpler advice: avoid processed food"
4,Taste of Apples Book on time,"The book was on time, in good condition, and good price. Cheaper than buying at my university bookstore. would buy again from this seller."
4,czech cuisine,"Lots of good recipes, that I was collecting. I am Czech, so I am happy. Will tell my friends.Purchased book at Amazon.combook was in good condition, also."
2,The book is good at scaring people!,"Yes, it is difficult to work on a cruise ship and no, noone has died so far despite all the scary things which the author talks about. If you are motivated all you need is a great application package and the current contact information of the cruise lines. Unfortunately this book is written in 1995 and since then is NOT updated, so forgt about up-to-date adfrsses and telephone numbers. It gives some information on how to write your application but it is so general that with the severe competiton for every open position nowadays, relying on it will surely doom your chances."
1,Where is the prove for dedication to quality?,"The author puts a lot of stress on his dedication to quality and great but not related experince. However the book since its publication in 1995 or 10 YEARS AGO has NOT been updated! Taht's why if you read it I am sure that you will end up with the same conclusion that he likes and knows to ""talk"" about quality but when it comes to delivering it, there is nobody already 10 Years! It's better to consider one of the other books."
3,better then the $10 cable,Last week I purchase an average $10 cable to hook up my ipod to my stereo. It work and sound fine. But I wasnt satified. So I purchase the Monster Cable and I notice two things right away. First the sound of the music that came out of my speakers was very crisp. Second the bass was much more powerful then my $10 cable. Now I'm happy. I gave it a rating of 3 b/c of the price for it. Could have cost less.
4,Don't buy this at radioshack,I just spent 29.99 on this at radio shack! Save 10 bucks and buy it on amazon.
1,ripoff,"The signal quality delivered by the iPod is not audibly diminished by a six dollar Radio Shack cable; this ""monster cable"" is availble merely to fleece consumers who have purchased genuinely high quality products like the iPod and the Powerbook, and can be tricked into thinking they also need a fancy cable which is basically no different from the generic product."
1,Use a digital video camera cable!,"Use the cable that comes with your digital video camera. One reviewer says this doesn't work but it DOES! On the 3 prong cable all you have to do is plug the white and yellow connecters into the left and right analog plugs in your receiver and it gives great sound. I am listening to it right now. Save your money, don't by this product!"
1,Monster Cable Alternative,"I looked into purchasing this myself, but read the below review about the THX version of this cable at half the price. Well I found the THX version at my local Radio Shack for $7.49!!! It is only available at the stores. Check the below link for availability at your local Shack. Good Luckhttp://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2110460&cp;=&kw;=3.5+to+rca&parentPage;=searchI'm not sure what the audio differences are between the two. Obvious differences are the color and cable construction. I installed the cable in my car with an auxillary interface for my factory Ford radio so I can connect my ipod. No problems & no flaws. I'm happy!"
1,monster cable RCAs for iPOD,"Paid $34 at Best Buy for a cable that DOESN'T EVEN WORK.Have always been skeptical of Monster Cable price points, don't buy them, took a chance.As a matter of principle, this product sucks. (For $34, I'm waiving the ""bad apple in every bunch..."" rebuttal)"
5,Helped me save a dying shelf system,"I have an old shelf system that would have already been in the trash heap if not for this little accessory. The CD player and tape deck went, but the stereo inputs still work and I have Dolby surround sound with a subwoofer hooked up to it...a must with my DVD player. So, for a while I had only been using the stereo for the TV/DVD, but now using my iPod I can have music again as well. In fact, it's preferable -- I've gone from having only a three-disc changer to having over 1,000 songs at my disposal -- all with CD quality sound and customized playlists."
1,icable Vs THX cable,"I highly recommend the THX cable that is 14.99+ tax. I own a AVR520(harman cardon receiver) I played ipod at about -35 decibels my entire house shook but not a hiss or distortion in the output, I am very particular about the quality of music output and THX won it hands down."
1,Monster Cable 126130 iCable for iPod,I don't believe this is a Monster Cable product. The RCA connections didn't fit the female connection firmly.
5,Monster Cable - Amp / Ipod,This cable is extremely well made and has the length to run from the amp in my saddle bag up through the frame and connects to the Ipod mounted on my gas tank. I strongly recommend this product.
2,Noregrets,"The RCA jack connection is so tight and the area on the cables to grip is so small that it makes these cables very difficult to connect and disconnect. I ended up tearing the cable's out layer off and almost damaging the actual cables trying to get them disconected. Once connected, the sound is fine from either a direct connection to Ipod, Ipod docking station."
2,Flawed Design. Expensive!!,"Purchased this cable a couple years ago. Right away, upon connecting to RCA plugs, fit was too tight! I had trouble making full contact. Tried it on my second receiver, and the same thing, plugging it in was, too tight! Sound quality was good. Then about a 1.5 yrs ago, I tried pulling the Monster cable out, but since the RCA connector ends were very tight, the darn thing came apart. The wires got exposed and detached from the welded ends. I kinda knew this would happen from the very beginning! Check online, and you'll read that Monster cables are VERY overrated!! No more Monster cable for me!! NOT Recommended!! Get Belkin or others!!"
2,You get what you pay for,"These sheets are not at all the quality that I expected. I'd puchased some other 400ct sheets a while back that work nicely for the cold winter nights. These, though nice and soft, are not nearly the same. I'm not sure how what the difference is between 400 and 410 threads, or weather I could ever verify it, but these sheets are much lighter material than I expected."
2,Great price but...,The fitted sheet pilled terribly after only 2 weeks. Next time I'll spend more money.
1,Chemical Coated Disapointment,"I ordered three sets of nice quality sheets figuring I would keep the best one. The Pike Street 410 felt softer and even seemed better then a 600 T.C. set. However after washing these sheets exactly as instructed, they turned into burlap! It became obvious that these sheets were coated with some agent to make them feel very soft and smooth. However once this was rinsed off they lost any quality they had. Don't buy.... and if you do, reserve judgement untill have a washing."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I bought these sheets because of the thread count (410) and because they were cotton sateen. I had previously purchased another brand at a 400 thread count made of cotton sateen and love them. You cannot even compare the two. For them to say these sheets are ""soft"" is totally untrue. I even used fabric softener and they are totally a plain pair of cotton sheets which are the farthest thing from being soft. I am not even sure they sent me the item they advertised. Big disappointment!"
1,unhappy camper,"This set of sheets is the worst I have ever purchased. I would say they are ""industrial strength"" but outside of a prison, I don't know what ""industry"" would accept them. Certainly no one in health care or a knowledge of fabrics. They are not like any 400 count or sateen sheet I have ever seen; they are rougher than 200 count, they do not feel like sateen. I washed and used ""ultra soft"" fabric softener, to no avail. I attempted to put them on a bed and the corner seam of the fitted corner split open.I am even hesitant to give them to Goodwill. I would not recommend these to anyone."
2,not sateen,"the sheets say they are sateen, but feel more like basic cotton or flannel. Since I was really going for that cotton sateen feel, i'm not impressed.i have a queen sized bed and have not had any problems getting the sheets to fit on the bed - even after washing - as some other reviews stated."
2,Doesn't feel like Sateen,"These sheets say they are sateen, but, they don't feel like it, they are no where near as soft as the sateen ones that I had before. They also don't fit my matress quite right. However, they do feel like they are of a good quality and would last a long time."
1,Like sleeping on Sandpaper,"I ordered these sheets because of the higher thread count. My experience with sheets of thread count over 400 has always been great! These are garbage! When I opened the package, they felt smooth and nice. I immediately washed them and put them on my bed. They felt like sandpaper! I had to get up and remake my bed with other sheets! These sheets are rougher than any I have ever seen. What do I do with them now? Money wasted - don't order."
3,"I like them, well worth 12.99",I bought them for 12.99 and I am sorry i only bought 2 sets that day. They are comfy and i have washed them several times. they feel great. They do not come off the bed and look new after washing. Not sure why so many unpleased people but they are good to me.
2,Bleached out color,Received this item new and it had bleached out color. Doesn't bother me because it stays hidden but for a new purchase it was still disappointing to see. Good enough to sleep on though.
1,410TC Pike Street Egyptian Sheets GARBAGE,"I bought these sheets because I thought that 410TC would be OK. I was wrong! These are the worst sheets I have ever used! My mattress is only 10 inches high and these barely fit, eventhough they say it will fit mattress' to 16 inches. They are super thin material, like a hanky. After one use they are all pilled and look ready to tear in some places. I don't think these will last long. They are not soft, and are made very, very cheaply! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Sheets not up to par,"I was excited about getting these sheets at a good price but had to return them because where the crease was the sheets were clearly faded as if they were stored in the sun for a long time. I was disappointed I had to send them back, I don't know if it was an isolated incedent or what,"
1,Defective Product,"I bought this product when it came it was discolored. Amazon sent me a new one same thing, it was discolored again in the same exact places!"
2,Totally uninteresting,"The characters of this book are astonishingly flat. Indeed, the heroine is a complete ditz at times too - her Pollyanna views get really tiresome after page 30. The hero is your stereotypical I-can't-commit-because-I'm-a-scholar type of guy.Boring."
3,Your basic platformer based on a show...,"If you aren't a fan of Futurama stop reading about this game and get something else. If you are a fan you may want to get this game. Its pretty fun, you are basically playing an episode. While it is fun it can be fustrating. The camera is akward and does take away from the gameplay. Also it can be very annoying trying not to die when jumping from object to object. The Bender levels are almost immpossible it seems. And Zoidberg only gets one level in the game.If your a fan you might want to at least rent this game. Its a couple hours of amusement."
2,Fan of Futurama? Spend your money on the DVDs.,"Cel-style animation. Original voices. Cut scenes with all the off-beat humor of the original TV series. What's not to love?Well, in the ""not to love"" category we have: Weak graphics. Substandard (non-customizable) controls. Dumb missions. And a third person camera that absolutely defies player control.All in all, I thouroughly enjoyed the cut scenes, and spent much of the gameplay trying to gouge out my own eyes. Thanks a load, Fox Interactive."
4,I can't believe all the bad reviews this game has.,"This game is a blast! I mean c'mon, you get to be Fry, Bender, Leela, and Dr. Z! How cool is that! I admit the game has some flaws. OK so the rotating camera is a little hard to control and can drive you crazy when you get killed on jumps. But except for Bender's one minute countdown out of the canyon, you can take your time on each jump. The funnest characters to play are Fry and Leela, but the whole game is great. Bender has the best lines, when he picks up his pink rocks for money he says cool stuff like 'This'll spruce up the pimp mobile' and 'Dis'll go great with my gold tooth.'"
5,It's like getting an extra episode of Futurama!,A full episode worth of cut scenes between the levels make it a must-have for any Futurama fan.The game gets better and better as it goes along. Don't judge it based on the warm-up.
4,Good News Everyone!,"This game was quite cool from my point of view, the sound was cool. I just love anything Futurama though. The graphics were awsome, (thanks to the Xbox). The game was awsome, I mean, playing Fry on my Xbox has never been cooler.The voice acting is great, just like the show. The writing is awsome. What can I say? Buy this game! You'll love it."
4,"Great, but tipsy for tall people","We own the P&T Sport and purchased this like many. I love the idea and the extra storage right at your fingertips. The difficulty is that my husband and I are tall and like the handle tipped up. In doing so, it causes drinks to tip and access a bits tricky. Bottled drinks are your best option. I'll be honest, there really is no great solution but thought I'd share my experiences."
4,BOB Handlebar Console,"I love my BOB Revolution and needed the handlebar console. The zip pocket is great and the two side cup holders are good for keys, cell phone, water bottles, etc."
4,"Overpriced, but great","A must-have for every B.O.B., but it should be included with the stroller, or at least be half the price. Fits and works great, and I would buy it again (but I would still be annoyed)."
5,Great Purchase,"I own a Sport Phil and Ted's stroller and wasn't very pleased with their cup holder option. I saw Bob's and decided to give it a try. I am happy to say that it has worked great. Phil and Ted's stroller has several handle angle options and although at some angles it is difficult to maneuver a water bottle in and out, overall it works wonderfully. Also, because Bob's cup holder is Velcro, you can adjust the straps to make the cup holder level no matter what angle you have the handlebar at."
5,"Great, adaptable Console","I bought this console for my Phil and Ted's E3 Stroller and love it! It's given me the extra space I neeed (for drinks, cell phone, snacks) and is not bulky in any way. I'm able to leave it on when I fold the stroller, and it stays in place! Highly recommend for jogging strollers!"
3,Not good for tall people on the Phil and Teds Sport,"If you want to use this for the Phil and Teds Sport remember that the bar has to be flat. So for tall people who need to angle the bar height up it won't work. In other words I sent it back, I am 5'9"". I am sure it is great for the BOB."
5,Convenient extra storage,"If you are an active parent who takes his/her kid out on nice days, this is a convenient add on to hold water bottles, keys and cell phone. It fastens securely, is easy to install, and puts everything you need right up by your hands. I recommend it for anyone who purchases a BOB."
3,"Happy with it, but it is expensive",It makes a big difference. I do not care for how expensive all the add-ons are though. You spend this much money on a stroller and you would think it would come with a cup holder. I could not recommend these products to family members and friends given the price gauging.
3,It does what is expected.,"This item does what is epected. I purchased this for the BOB Revolution and it works just fine. There is a center compartment for cell phone/ipod/MP3 player. It also has 2 cup holders that fit most normal sized water bottles. Overall, I am happy with the purchase but the price tag is higher than it needs to be."
3,A very nice product for our BOB Revolution Stroller but...,"...you'd expect something like this to be included when you spend $350 on a stroller.Truth be told, I am happy with our BOB revolution stroller and but I will not recommend this purchase to any of my friends (my wife forced me to pay $30 for this item). Honestly, is making $30 worth more than your customers ""highly recommending"" purchase of your products that cost somewhere north of $300? I think not.Someone from BOB's marketing department should be fired."
1,Doesn't handle enough Digital Camera Card Types.,"For a device that should work for the world of Digital Photography, I feel bad. This thing won't work with Sony Cameras and their memory sticks, or the Olympus cameras and their xD cards. I have 3 different Olympus cameras, and I can't use this. I want to be able to. The manufacturer should have thought of that and compatability issues when they created the device."
1,"If I could give it a lower rating than 1 star, I would.",I started up the samples for each of the tracks on this CD with an open mind. But found myself woefully disappointed at each and every playing of them. They were all horrendous.I hope Blackie enjoys the money he got from the licenses to the tracks on the songs of this CD. Because there certainly is nothing else for anyone to enjoy about it.
2,W.A.S.P. songs ot meant for death sound,"When I first heard this album was being released I was very excited. Needless to say when I purchased it I was a little disappointed. It was very cool to have in my hand a tribute to my favorite band but when I spun it I found that most of the songs were bare discernable as the W.A.S.P. tunes I knew and loved. There were a couple of descent track that I thought made it worth owning the disc. Black Earths rendition of ""Wild Child"" is a very good cover, along with Mystifier's version of ""The Torture Never Stops"". But as far as the rest of the disc goes, if you are a W.A.S.P. fan and you like the ""Death Metal"", ""Cookie Monster"" type vocals, you will love this album. But if you are more like I am and stick to the traditional ""mild growl"" vocal like Blackie Lawless you probably wont. Either way it is a CD worth having a place in you W.A.S.P. collection."
2,You can do better,"For the price, this is too simple and basic a book. It's limited in terms of a very few vendors and a limited number of car types primarilly pre-1940 hot rods. Sometimes it's almost like a protracted ad for ""SO-CAL"" products. You can get as good or better information and advice by looking through old issues of ""Street Rodder"" and ""Hot Rod"" magazines."
3,Assembly manual for So-Cal chassis kit,"This is an assembly manual for a So-Cal chassis kit. I was looking fo a manual on how to design a hot rod chassis. This is definitely not that!! Very little information about details or design criteria. Unless you bought a So-Cal chassis kit, spend your money elsewhere."
4,old memories,reminds me of the old space 1999 tv show does a good job of bridging season one and two by having tony show up in it and the reason why he was promoted to second in command also the reasoning for getting rid of main mission a very good read felt like the actual actors would recomend also a better ending for paul morrow which i found alot more satisfying then him and kano dying in a eagle cash
5,Family Fun,We ordered this ball because we had used one just like it on vacation and liked it. It isn't as hard as some volleyballs and the whole family can enjoy playing with it. We've been very pleased.
1,Do Not Buy This Volleyball,"I ordered this volleyball and it arrived promptly. However, the ball doesn't retain air because there is no plug to stop air from escaping from the inflate hole - it's just a hole in the ball. I'm not sure if the one I received is defective or if they're all like this, but the ball is completely useless and I am returning it. The Mikasa VX20 Beach Classic Volleyball I ordered from Amazon is in great condition and I would recommend purchasing that instead."
2,not a long-lasting product,"I have owned this product for about a year and can not say how often I'm trying to fix it. The peg at the bottom where the hamper tilts from has come out of place and eventually split the ""wood."" I wish it would have lasted since it does look good and fits my needs. It was awful to put together on top of it which makes me even more annoyed that it didn't last."
2,a little tacky but mostly functional,"overall, the product looks pretty nice and I like the design of it, but when I was putting it together, some of the screws supplied were either too small or didn't have the right amount of ""grip"" to join the pieces together. also, the material is partical board with a very thin veneer. probably if I saw it in the store, i might not have paid 100 bucks for it, but I buy a lot of my stuff used so it's hard to convince me to pay full price when I'm always getting deals at thrift shops. I guess they don't make 'em like they used to."
2,Items missing,"Items E and F in the assembly kit were missing, Screw No.9 does not fit! so we are stuck with not being able to assemble the whole thing!"
1,Not elegant!,"Poor quality, and you need to be an engineer to put all the pieces together! Then, when fully assembled, set it up, and it pops apart. Picture looks great, but anything but ""elegant""."
2,"Good for ""newbies"" but not for much more.","I've been following Kate Bush's career since her first album, ""The Kick Inside"" was released in 1978. I'm not an aficionado or a fanatic, but have kept tabs on her and have all of her albums and a few collectable/bootleg CD's. Well okay, you could consider me a fan.This DVD isn't endorsed by Kate and does not live up to her high recording standards. It's mostly made up of interviews with four fairly knowledgeable people about Kate's life and their take on her music, some very short (old) interview clips with Kate and a few poor quality snippets of her videos. The entire DVD is of VHS quality IMHO and doesn't really offer anything new.For a newbie it might be a good starting point, but for anyone looking for quality Kate Bush material it will be a disappointment. If you want good quality Kate Bush video and music look elsewhere...it's almost all available."
3,Indept review 1978-1985,"This dvd examines Kate bushes earily works in great detail, but sadly gives little time to any of her work from 1985 up to her last realease the master piece ""Aerial""For Kate bush fans 1978-1985 Only"
3,Just okay for me,"I like the fact, that there are more tests in the box as in other test kits,but I have trouble to read the result sometimes. Probably because of the pcos... So dont waste your money, if you have pcos."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"Finbar Furey is the best piper you'll ever hear. To hear him play these tunes, to hear him play the registers, is pure joy!"
4,Love 4AM,4am best studio track of pastorius eva; and it's on this CD!Including a lot of other goodies!! Listen and enjoy!
2,flat sound from flat speakers,"These satellite speakers look stylish and are small, and the subwoofer has good sound ouput, but that's where it ends. The satellite speakers have a flat, tinny sound. When someone sings an ""S"" sound, it comes out with a harsh-sounding hiss. Even at reduced price, I don't recommend these. I'm pretty disappointed, because I've had good experiences with Philips products in the past."
3,"Excellent Scanner, but Mac Software Needs Polish","I purchased this scanner to import glossy photos into my Mac Pro. So far, it has been a pleasure. Scan times are short at typical resolutions. The scanner really shines when the auto feeder is used; it can take a multipage document and render it into a PDF in no time at all. Unfortunately, if you use this scanner with a Mac, you will be somewhat disappointed with the software. Yes, the software is a Universal Binary program that works well in Leopard, but it lacks quite a bit of polish. I found myself using Photoshop CS3, Mac OS X's built-in Image Capture, and even third-party scanning software to achieve that ""Mac-like"" simplicity and elegance when interfacing between my Mac and this scanner. I hope Epson will dedicate more resources to updating their Mac software; it's the only missing link in this package as far as I am concerned."
1,Dont buy it......,This machine is NOT compatible with Windows Vista machines regardless what the description says. Epson tech support was horrible. The drivers will NOT work with a Vista machine.
4,Full track listing,"For the 2-disc version.This is the 1998 Cog Sinister/Voiceprint label reissue (COGVP107CD) of this 1987 compilationThe initial 1,000 copies came with a bonus CD featuring:01. Look, Know02. Tempo House03. I'm Into C.B.04. Mere Pseudo Mag Editor (Smith)Tracks 1-4 recorded live at Derby Hall, Bury on 27 April 1982 (although the CD cover says the tracks come from the Band On The Wall, Manchester 1982)."
2,"Good Idea, poor workmanship.","This item would be great except the canvas bags may as well be made of tissue paper. Within 1 week, all the seams have torn and unwraveled! Bummer. Also it is VERY wobbley! They should, at the very least, offer replacement canvas bags!"
3,A good start,This book is a good start at translating DRESSAGE OF THE OUTDOOR HORSE or DRESSAGE OF THE CROSS COUNTRY HORSE. But you can get 2 books in one for the same price by buying METHODICAL DRESSAGE OF THE RIDING HORSE and DRESSAGE OF THE OUTDOOR HORSE translated by Michael Fletcher published by Xenophon Press.'Methodical Dressage of the Saddle Horse-Dressage of the Outdoor Horse'
2,Misleading,The last two songs on this album are not even Merle! The songs are sung by someone named Mike Lunsford. Plus the Merle songs are ones you can easily find on their original collections. Steer clear of this one. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because most of the songs were by Merle....he deserves that anyway!
4,Bike mount,The mount is very solid and holds the GPS well. It was bigger than I expected but I can deal with that. I gave it 4 stars solely on the price. I think this item is over priced for no more than it is.
5,Zach is not Black,"Good movie, but not what i expected.Still a good add to the collection of over 400 dvds.Thanks Zach!"
1,Sick and disturbing movie,"A waste of internet bandwidth, and Amazon web storage space. Like watching turd dry. Not even worth a 20-word review.Zero stars."
3,Interesting concept,"When I read the films synopsis about people exploding, it amused me enough to watch it....not a common film theme! But the film evolves into a fascinating plot: the human race cannot become stressed. If we knew we would die under stress, is it possible to erase it? It could make for a more peaceful world, but a happy one? The film leads to the concept of eradicating individual thought (but doesnt delve into that sci-fi direction) as a solution. This story runs slowly and can lose your attention or depress you at times, but stick with it. The ending is a wonderful surprise that really put a smile on my face. It changes the entire mood of the film and the directors message shouts loud and clear. This movie will leave you thinking....that in itself deserves a good rating."
2,Nice re-imagining of Fahrenheit 451 - until the 2nd half,"This starts out as a quirky, interesting, slow attack on corporate and suburban life, which is ruined by the 2nd half. The movie has no idea where to go, flops around like a fish out of water for far too long, and the ending is predictable, abrupt, and unsatisfying."
4,Brazil: De-Gilliam-ized,"Well, I won't go so far as to say that George Washington Winsterhammerman is the 21st century Sam Lowry. But I loved the understated insanity spiked with corporate nothingisms and friendly Jeffers logo salutes. Imagine Wes Anderson reworkingEquilibrium. The wheels do come off the wagon a bit at the end. Seemed like someone realized they only had 10 more minutes left and started gluing together sweepings from the editing room floor. If you're looking for the Will Farrell style over-the-top silliness, this may not be your best choice. But I thought this was perfectly weird and charming."
1,nothing to write about,"Didnt find it funny.. didnt find it inspiring.. basically just a waste of time. I guess some people would claim this to be an arty movie. Watched it to the end, but it never got any better. It'll leave you asking ""how did this film get made?"""
2,weak,"This probably deserves 3 stars but I had to give it 2 because I expected more. I could only get through about 30 minutes or so before I turned it off. If you have an abundance of time to kill or are extremely high then check it out. The main point of the movie was established in the first 15 minutes, after that it was just boring. This would have been a very thought provoking short film."
1,It showed promise. At first.,"I have enjoyed almost every movie I've ever seen that starred Zach Galifianakis.This is the one that made me add ""almost"" to the line above."
4,A Dystopian View of the World - a la Brazil,Lots of really funny scenes which just make you chortle and shake your head. Happy Jeffers Day to you! (_-|-_)Not very fast moving but quite entertaining.
5,A surprising independent gem,"I like Wes Anderson films and wish that ""Idiocrisy"" and ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"" had been better. To me, this film pays off the way ""Bottlerocket"" paid off. The vision for this film (an ambitious dystopian dark independent comedy) comes together absolutely beautifully. There are some good, solid laughs and great points made about society. It is cast perfectly. Recommended."
2,Quality Control Problems and very slow focus,"The copy I had didn't autofocus correctly, it had a back focusing problem. But even ignoring this, the autofocus was so ridiculously slow it was practically unusable. As someone else said, you could go get a cup of coffee while this thing focused.PROS:- Very sharp, even wide open- Good build qualityCONS:- Unusable autofocus- Quality control issuesIt could be used as a manual focus lens, but for that, there might be cheaper options available."
1,Such a shame,"Image quality is just astounding. I love the pics I took with this lens.When I purchased the lens I realized that the focus was a little forward, but as it's a macro I'd only be using manual focus.All was going well until it started to auto focus when both the camera and the lens were in manual focus mode.I have returned it today and miss it already."
2,Just O.K.,"The inside dial of the clock came off when I receivedit. The dial was secured by double sided tapes whichwere no longer doing the job. I had to dismantle theclock and secure the dial in its proper place. Thisprocess took up over an hour of my time which I didnot expect when I paid full price for a purchase.Also, the clock was always off by half a minute evenafter a few attempts to adjust it.The nice thing about this clock is the wooden frameand you can't hear the clock ticks."
1,Ratz Are Nice (PCP) Is Pure Garbage,"I started reading ""Ratz Are Nice (PCP)"" with an open mind right after finishing a great novel entitled ""American Skin."" That was my biggest mistake. Whereas Don De Grazia's ""American Skin"" was a cohesive, inventive narrative revolving around finely developed and believable characters within an admittably ""fringe"" subculture, ""Ratz Are Nice"" immediately climbs uphill with a narrative style that is incomprehensible, gimmicky and just plain boring. Quite frankly, Braithwaite's writing here is pure gibberish. Often it wasn't even clear to me who was who or why certain ""characters"" (for lack of a better word) were included in his story at all. The best three things about ""Ratz Are Nice (PCP)"" are (i) the front cover photo of a group of interacial skins and streetpunks, (ii) the entertaining (although sometimes inaccurate) ""Author Notes"" and (iii) the fact that the thing is short. Avoid at ALL costs!"
5,"Robert ""Nerve"" Miller","In Ratz are Nice (PSP) Braithwaite exposes a generally little known and entirely misunderstood culture existing not in London or Toronto but in Victoria, B.C. Until now best known as the land of the newly wed and nearly dead, one feels as though a rock has been overturned in the pristine rain forest; underneath, a seething, alarming and complex world draws one downward for a closer look, triggering feelings which range from dismay to utter fascination.Ratz are nice(PSP) is an intelligent, wild and at times unbelievable commentary on sub-society deserving of attention and understanding. Cheers to Braithwaite for taking on such a monumental project and for completing it."
2,Another voice searching for tongue space,"Short and sour. ""Ratz Are Nice: (Psp)"" is a small book that pushes big buttons. Author Braithwaite obviously knows what he is about and tells a story from the intra-abdominal site. Characters are believeable and he makes us care about them. But the problem with wading through the hieroglyphics and lingo, page layout and punctuation oddities in the end detracts from the idea of the novel. It just becomes kitsch. If you feel you must read this book, I suggest you start with the Author's Notes: this reads with great ease and wit and venom. For the rest, the work involved in getting there doesn't seem to justify the payoff.....at least to this reader."
5,Boys will Be Boys,"""This is not a generational novel, and these boys are not typical. But their stories have very definite, if inchoate, things to say. In Braithwaite's remarkable hands, [sex] becomes the connective tissue, as often tender as it is rough, that binds the entire social world he's concerned with, transcending even the boundaries of music."""
5,Currently my favorite album!,"After I recommendation from a friend, I decided to buy this album and I've absolutely fallen in love with it. The melodies and lyrics are catchy, especially the song Michael Jackson, which, as the name suggests, sounds very similar to his music. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
1,My dear lord!!!!!!!,"What the hell happened here? did midway accidentally release an unfinished game? Short and sweet....This game sucks....bad....illegally bad. Terrible graphics... choppy controls, and the whole buying and selling drug thing gets old after a while. And whats with the 3 song playlist? They must have given the artists a preview copy of this game, thats probably why no one would let their music in this game. c'mon Midway...you're better than this."
2,"NARC, a GTA wanabe!","This game had so much going for it. But, like most '80's video games that have been redone it SUCKS. Crappy story, followed by crappy gameplay. I think Midway should of held off the release to improve. I know this isn't GTA, but that is beside the point."
3,Rented,your best bet is not to buy this its boring and gay if gta were like this it would go nowhere dont get this of you wont a gmae like this get true crimes
1,Doesn't live up to the hype!,"The under table plug in feature and cord minder/iron rest were alluring features, but the plug broke off on second use, and the iron holder is in a fixed position making storage difficult. The cover is flimsy; impossible to put on easily after laundering. Very disappointing, indeed. My kingdom for a sturdy, ergonomic ironing board!!"
2,Lacking in quality,Plunger broke the first week. Seems to be a recurring problem. This is the second or third one I've ordered. The plunger spring must not be very strong at all.
2,not strong enough,"With Honda's massive ignition/keyless entry keys and FOBs, nothing really fits on the keychain if you need to add more keys. I put about 6 other keys and the small ring broke off. the larger ring holds 2 honda keys and one keyfob...great keychain if you only have one house key and one or 2 car keys. Nice keychain overall, but just not strong enough if you need a lot of keys on one ring."
2,"If You Want To Be Depressed, Read This Book","Excellently written, but with the outcome already known, this book shows the nightmarish life of Antoinetta ""Berthe"" Mason, Edward Rochester's doomed bride. Rochester himself is a doomed soul, as he has no idea of how to deal with the brightly colored tragedy of his early marriage. Antoinetta needs major therapy from page one, and Rochester is the proper English gentleman who is corrupted and broken in a thousand ways, for he has no idea of the disaster he has been lured into.We already know Anakin is going to be Vader, and now we know how Rochester and Bertha turn to the Dark Side. Gee, thanks. Can I have those hours back, now?Skip the prequels, and just enjoy ""Jane Eyre""."
5,nice & fresh,I love fresh books and this was one of them. Bought it a while back and had no problem with it. Buy books on amazon!
5,Really yucky and cool,"This picturebook is aimed at primary elementary students, and shows the gory life of a 16th century medical staff. It has many yucky details, which the kids love, and is interesting for comparisons of how much the medicine advanced since that age. The facial expressions are real fun, especially all the teeth-clenching of patients faced with primitive medical tools (which seem to inflict more pain than cure)."
4,Amazing Product,"Not much for using a toner. Have strayed away, but always seem to come back to Cellex-C. Yes it is pricey, but it does what it claims. The other high dollar crap you buy at department stores don't hold a candle to this stuff."
5,Una manera envidiable de escribir cuentos,"Lydia Cabrera, ademas de gustarle la antropologia, era una excelente escritora. Pocos como ella logran narrar un cuento que te despierte emociones con pocas palabras. Dicen que aprendio en Paris este modo de escritura"
4,Kudos to Michael,This was an excellent collection of short stories. It is easy to read and the subject matter was very interesting. The author has a lot of talent and insight.
3,Too obsessed with green. Too feable sound,I liked the light brown wood grained color. There should be two user selectable settings for sound. It would be nice if we could mute one or two selctable bird sounds
1,Poor Packaging,I love the clock but it was packaged improperly and when I pulled it out of the box the back broke off of the front of the clock. So it couldn't be hung. We had to gorilla glue it back together to hang it. All this from a brand new item!
3,new bird clock not the same,"For many years we had an Audubon bird clock. When it finally stopped working, we ordered the current version. I was skeptical, because I had read feedback that the sound of the birdcalls was not very loud. The new clock has birdsong volume that is fine, and the light sensor works well. The news calls themselves we do not like. The original clock had birdcalls that are commonly heard...robins, bluebirds, mourning doves, chickadees, etc. The new calls are exotic birds I have never seen or heard. The original clock's bridcalls were much better, and I quickly learned to know the time by the hour-specific call. I really wish the maker would use the traditional calls, or at least offer an alternate version using the 'old' calls. The new clock is OK, works OK, but definitely is NOT as much fun to use and own as the original."
3,Clock Review,This is the second Audubon clock I have owned. The last clock had bird calls for a longer period of time thus helping me recognize birds by their call in nature. The bird sounds at each hour on this clock are very short. I will never be able to recognize these birds. I do like the pictures of the birds on the clock.
2,I DON HEAR ANYTHING 3 FEET AWAY THE CLOCK,"THIS IS ONLY A WALL CLOCK......SOUND OF BIRDS MUST BE ALOUD, I COULD HARDLY HEAR ""SONGS"" OF THE BIRDS......REALLY I CAN'T SAY THIS IS A BIRD CLOCK."
3,Not like the older version,"I had an older version of this clock for 13 years and it was finally time to replace. The clock runs well but the bird sounds are quiet and uninteresting, nothing like the rich, vibrant sounds on the old clock."
4,"Audubon Singin Bird Clock - 13""","The only negative thing that I found in this model, was the sound of the birds; too low. I put new batteries of the best alkaline brand in the market, and the sound was same: too low,low. In the brief instructions included, no appear nothing about how increase the volumen in order to ear the songs of the birds.This is my 2nd CLock that I have, the first was the model smaller, same brand, and the sound of the birds was !excelent!Please, show me, and future buyers, how to increase de volumen, or, if I has to return the item.If this problem is corrected, my opinion wil be; !!FIVE STARS!!"
4,Good clock,"Looks and sounds great...only complaint is that you cannot adjust the volume. We have our clock in a well lit area (day and night) so the sensor is getting a lot of light, but it's still not as loud as we want it to be."
1,Replacement a big disappointment,"Forgot the fact there's a sensor added to this version (I bought a replacement of one given to my late parents), which I thought was why I couldn't hear the birds, even with a night lig, even standing in the room! I'm amazed something this shabby continues to be sold and that the manufacturer hasn't addressed this problem. I send them two emails, I was so ticked off. I returned it immediately."
2,Clock song not loud enough,Used to have the frog clock which had different species and was perfect for sound. Wish it had a volume control.
3,Audubon Singing Bird Clock Review,"I originally purchased this clock to replace a similar clock, that after many years of service, began to lose minutes. This replacement clock however did not produce the same high volume of audio as my original, and I am disappointed. Otherwise, the clock is just fine."
2,Audubon Bird Clock,"Not nearly as nice as a previous bird clock I had purchased years ago. The variety of birds are not as pretty and colorful as my previous clock. The birds aren't very loud and their bird call is very short. Don't care for the yellowish backround coloring on the face of the clock, makes it look faded and aged. Unfortunaely, after researching, this was the only clock I could find."
3,AUDUBON CLOCK,IT LOOKS OK AND KEEPS REASONABLE TIME BUT WE CAN HARDLY HEAR THE BIRDS. WE WERE TOLD TO PUT IT IN MORE LIGHT BUT IT DID NOT HELP AT ALL. THEY OFFERED TO REPLACE IT BUT IT IS TOO MUCH WORK TO PACK UP AND SEND BACK.
3,Some good birds missing,"I've read about the too-quiet birds on this clock, and here's another issue to consider. My parents had the previous model from Audubon, and it included some very distinctive birds that even a non-birdwatcher like me could identify: owl, Canada goose, mockingbird. The new one has a less-varied selection so that someone like me will have to get up and look at the wall to see which hour it is. Also they'll all ""sound the same"" to my young kids."
2,Can barely hear the birds !!,"Called to report Audobon Singing Bird clock has very low volume though all steps followed completely and it was verified that there have been other calls about this. The manufacturer of the clock is at fault as they have decided to turn down the volume with these new productions. WHY ? It's a shame. Was looking for the same sound I had on my previous clock this was a replacement for which was more robust. The seller contacted me personally and was very professional and issue worked out instantly. Please Feldstein @ Associates,,,turn the sound back up !!!"
3,Not as Good as Old Version,"The singing bird Audubon clock is ok, but not as good as the older version I have had for at least 15 years. The older one sings louder. The new clock can barely be heard at 11:00 am with the room as bright as it gets. Other birds can barely be heard. Some are as loud as the old version. Thinking of sending it back - maybe the clock is defective.????"
2,Sounds too Soft,"I'm a bird lover and received as a gift a previous bird clock that I really enjoyed. When it stopped after several years, I thought this clock would be a perfect replacement. But, the bird sounds are so soft I can barely hear them if I'm in the same room. Thinking my light was too low I turned on all the fixtures and even got a high beam flashlight to add light, but the birds calls are just barely heard. I'm disappointed in my clock."
5,audubon singing bird clock,This is my first bird clock and i love it.it is a joy to listen to the birds at each hour of the day and night. very nice
3,Not as good as the original,"Keeps good time but it needs direct sunlight to make sound. Still it is very quiet even in direct sunlight. I had the original Audabon bird clock and loved it, but it got old replaced it with this one and not worth it. Even in direct sunlight it is very quiet. Skip This!!!"
5,Nice way to tell time,My daughter bought one for her place recently and we went for our for our cabin in Vermont. Hard to tell if the sounds are coming from the clock or outside. Seems well built and not unreasonably priced. You can get cheap knockoffs of this clock but they do not tend to have the light sensor that silences it at night.
2,A Sad Song,"The clock is attractive and easy to read. However, like other reviewers, I find that you can only hear the bird sounds if you are literally right next to the clock. I placed it in a very bright spot per the instructions. I previously had a meowing cat clcok in the same place and you could hear it throughout the house. In addition, although the rim is plastic, the face cover is glass. The very first day I hung it on the wall, it fell off and the glasss shattered into dozens of pieces. Tiny fragments flew all over my kitchen including into pet bowls."
1,This product sucked.,It was destroyed before I could even get to see it working. Who ever used a gorilla to ship it should not send their packages to their local zoo to be tested for mailing endurance.
1,Seller couldn't be bothered to add packing material,"--and therefore the clock's face, which is made of glass, was totally shattered upon arrival. I would order this clock from another seller. This is terrible customer service."
3,What happened to the midnight Owl??,"The ORIGINAL bird clock was from Audobon, & it featured an Owl at 12p.m., which would ""hoot"" with wonderful clarity. First time I heard it was at my Mom's house, home for a vacation. The Owl started hooting, and I thought, ""It must be in the tree right by the front porch here!"" So, went out to look and he was then hooting behind me! Very puzzled... I stepped back into the house and there was the Bird Clock and the Owl was sounding the Noon Hour. It was very funny. Since the old clock quit, I've tried in vain to find another. But the owl at midnight has been replaced by all kinds of other ""songbirds"". And there are all these ""similar"" clocks claiming to be the ""Original Singing Bird"" clock.They are not. Hooty the Owl was the Original, and still the best."
1,Disappointment,"Should have listened to the reviews...purchased this clock to replace similar one I bought elsewhere. The second hand stuck almost immediately, stopping the clock. The bird sounds definitely were nowhere near as loud as on my original (and please, don't anyone reiterate that the sounds are light sensitive, I'm aware of that). Returned it without problems, but am disappointed not to have it, as I loved my last one (whose second hand also began to stick, but only after two years.)"
1,sound not loud enugh,"I returned my clock because the sound could not be heard. I bought another one from someone else, same problem. Called the company and said they have had a problem with the sound and a new clock will come out in mid February."
1,The clock that never arrived,"I would love to write a positive review for this product, but it has never arrived. I have emailed the company concerning this, but they have not answered the email. I will be glad to amend this review should I hear from them so we can resolve this matter."
2,Bird Clock doesn't sing.,I am only satisfied with the look of this clock. It is exactly what I was expecting but I was buying it primarily to hear the birdies sing so I am very disappointed. The birds do sing but it is so soft I cannot hear it unless I am sitting right under it. My daughter has this same clock and her birds are very easy to hear.
3,I had some problems with the clock but got them resolved.,"I recently purchased an Audubon Singing Bird Clock through Amazon and the clock I received was defective (small hand was loose and it did not run). I sent it back and received a replacement clock about 2 weeks later. This one was defective also. The representative called me and explained that they had received a shipment of faulty clocks and was sympathetic to the time and trouble I had taken to send for one. She said that the problem has been resolved with the faulty clock shipment. When I asked to just have my Visa account credited with a refund, she agreed to do so and the next day I received a confirmation e-mail from Amazon stating that my account had been credited for the clock."
2,Beautiful Songs Wasted Due to Low Volume,"I received a Brazilian-bird version of this clock from our exchange student's family and loved it. I purchased this one in hopes that I would enjoy it just as much. I would not have purchased this clock if I'd known that you can barely hear the birds even when standing right next to the hanging clock in a bright, sun-lit room after installing new batteries. What a waste of technology and money to record such lovely bird songs and then not follow through with adequate speaker volume."
5,A bird call for each hour,"I bought a singing bird clock 15 years ago to learn the individual songs, and also remind me of passing hours for billing purposes (I was a freelancer). The recordings finally wore out but I couldn't find a replacement. Now Audubon has introduced me to 10 fresh singers, along with a background booklet on the 12 birds pictured in color on the clock. It's delightful to hear a different song each hour, pitched just right to be unobtrusive, but atttentive listeners can end up subtly identifying the hour with the singer. These days I find the name under each picture hard to read, but once I've heard each song I can recognize it. It's like taking a tranquil walk in the woods and it gives me joy to think a child might grow up hearing these sweet songs as a natural part of their lives."
4,Brid clock,"My only negative comment is about the bird choices.. not the function of the clock itself. It has great sound clarity with each different bird sound. I would have preffered the birds more common to my region.. like the cardinal,robin,Canadian geese, woodpecker,owl,chickadee,blue jay,or starlings."
3,Hardly know it's there...,"This is the second Audubon singing bird clock I have owned. It is far quieter than the first, and the bird singing sequence is shorter. This clock contains my favorite birds, so it's disappointing that it doesn't live up to my expectations. Maybe the manufacturer should add a volume control setting."
1,bird song clock,This was a dissappointment. The songs are not as loud and clear as the older model clock I owned previously that just stopped working. This was supposed to be a replacement and I will continue to look for the older audubon model bird clock at yard sales.
1,Birds with Laryngitis,"I should have heeded the reviewers who complained that the bird songs were nearly inaudible. This made in China clock typified the poor quality control and craftsmanship we usually get from those products. The Audubon Society should be ashamed for lending their prestigious name to such a disappointing item. Apparently, some of these clocks are satisfactory and others just don't work.I gave it to my bird-loving father for a Christmas present -and he was so disappointed. The volume is too low and the length of the bird-song is just one or two notes. Absolutely NOT like the bird clocks that were previously sold. Don't waste your time and money.I am sending it back for a refund."
1,disappointing,I had a singing bird clock before the Audubon Bird Clock. The bird sounds were louder and clearer. This clock was quite disappointing and if I knew it was so inferior to my former bird clock I would not have purchased it.
1,came damaged,The clock itself if great but it has an imperfection inside the glass that is very noticable and the outside of the glass has a long scratch.
3,clock,Very good product very good investment for my prodject. Im very happy i found and bought this item. Good item for my project makes me proud to have found this
1,Clock worked for three months.,"Purchased as gift August 4, 2012. Clock stopped working November 9, 2012. Sad. Looking for replacement, though, we enjoyed the bird songs very much."
2,disappointed,"What a bummer. I bought a bird clock about 15 years ago (not an Audubon clock) and have loved it! The songs were loud and clear, and when the batteries went out, I noticed immediately. This last time when the songs stopped and no new batteries would get it going, I realized it had finally bitten the dust. Just couldn't live without it, so went to Amazon and ordered the Audubon bird clock. You can barely hear the songs at all. I really miss my old bird clock!!"
1,Disappointed as clock is defective,"The clock is defective. It kept time, but you could not hear the birds. I wanted a replacement, but could not get a replacement from Lowest Prices & Best Service Corp. even though they say the are #1 in Service, but Amazon credited me the cost of the Audubon Singing Bird Clock- 13"" without returning it. I was disappointed it didn't work because I was having a hard time finding singing bird clocks. I still will be doing business with and through Amazon.com"
4,Nature and functionality,"I like this little clock. The birds sound real! They add a tranquility to our home. Wish they had other color choices, though."
1,Birds don't sing out!,"I've purchased the Audubon Society Singing Bird clock twice. I returned the first one because the bird calls were very quiet even when the clock was under a bright halogen light. I thought it was just that clock, so I tried again. The second clock had just the same problem, and this one also was returned. I actually own a similar clock that works very well (put out by another company), so I'm giving up on the Audubon Society clock."
4,A review of the new version of the bird clock,"I've had this bird clock for over 10 years (the older version) and it is lovely. It still works.I ordered this new one. I like the new one, but some of the bird's sing quietly even if you change the sound level. Also, I miss the owl and the geese from the old clock. Otherwise, the new clock is a great gift and nice to watch on the wall."
4,Relaxing sounds,"The sounds from the clock were weak at first but they seem to be a little louder now, all in all we enjoy our purchase, thank you"
1,Pros n Cons,"The pro is obvious, it looks really good with the polished chrome and 3d emblem. The Con is that my bumber like all 2005 chevys has a ""V"" in the middle of it. When putting this on, the emblem is not part of the plate like others are made. The double sticky that holds the emblem on started to come loose. In short............very good looks but extremely poor quality."
1,Flimsy at best,(...) One twist of the shoe rack and a spoke broke on one of the levels. I didn't even have it fully loaded with shoes.
2,Poor workmanship,"Poor workmanship, rusted inside of chrome cover (is it really chrome with rust on it), very poor construction of the rubber piece and is smells like rubber.I really don't want to smell rubber in my closet."
2,Tips easily / wobbly,Ours lasted for about a year under heavy use. It was wobbly from the start and evenyually loosened up and fell apart despite repeated and regular tightening. Unfortunately there are not too many options out there.
1,Absolutely Horrible and Cheaply Made,Do not buy this show rack!!! It is cheaply made and flimsy! Horrible!!!
3,shoe tree,This item was easy to put together- the tools you need were included. It works for my size 6 ladies footwear (not for boots) but I would not try to use it for my husband's size 13's. It looks a lot better than shoes on the floor and takes up little space which is why I purchased it.
3,works,"This product does what it is supposed to do, I like it and hope it continues to work as well as it does now."
5,Fun Kit,Great kit. Got here fast and in great shape nothing broken ot bent. The kit is as i remember old airplane kits to be (well the parts are cut better then the old ones) was pleased with it and had fun building it
3,Missing Balsa,"Some of the pre-cuts were missing. I had spare Balsa and made a couple of pieces.Seems there was no Quality Control, It was very noticeable on the sheet that parts were missing."
4,Love it but not the best,"I love this product but it's not the best of the series. I cannot vacuum seal soups or other liquids. It works great for meats and the extra bowls I have bought but does not have a setting for liquids so I cannot vacuum anything liquid. Other then that YES, I love this thing. Can't live without it at this point in life. I go to SAMS and buy 5 lbs of hamburger and seal it into smaller packs."
2,BAD,THIS BOOK HAD SOME THINGS IN IT THAT WERE OK BUT IT ISN'T REALISTIC AT ALL. SHE IS ALL ABOUT PROVING YOU ARE BETTER THAN A BOY. SHE ACTS LIKE IT IS ILLEGAL TO HAVE A CRUSH ON A BOY UNTILL YOU'RE AN OLD MAID.THIS BOOK IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD GO IN MY BURN PILE. IF YOU ARE AROUND THE AGE OF 7-9 YOU MIGHT AND THATS A REAL BIG MIGHT LIKE THIS BOOK.
4,pleasant harp music but,This is pleasant harp music but how do we know which artist is playing which track?A list of artists is given in small print on the back but no indication of which artist is playing what. I like to know who is playing at any time in a compilation album.That said I recommend the album for the music and artists whoever they are.
3,"Not bad, but not what I was looking for","I was hoping for really beautiful, flowing and melodic harp music. This cd was good, but the harp is not always in the music (you will hear violins and other instruments for five minutes before even hearing a harp), and it wasn't the wonderful, relaxing music I thought I was getting."
3,Misleading Title On Cover,"While the quality of the book is fine, the printed title on the cover is deceptive (""1000 Robots, Spaceships, & Tin Toys""). Robots and spaceships are only a very small fraction of the ""1000"" pictures.Apparently, the book was formerly titled, ""1000 Tin Toys"" which is much more accurate."
2,replacement ironing pad,the quality is good but it did not fit on my standard ironing board. it was about 3 inches too short
1,wrong color and size,"The picture shows a squared off end not the standard pointed end,but it is pointed. Even though it has the pointed end like a standard cover, it is shorter to fit the shorter boards, not a standard board. It did not fit my ironing board right.Ad also said the color is grey but it is blue!I called customer service and was told I could return it but at my cost!!"
1,NOT as described,"This is NOT a 2-piece product. The size is not correct either.I explained this when I returned the product, but I guess no one got the message! Don't go there!"
2,Cuba Jungle is Okay...,"Hello everyone out there in Amazon World...Cuba Jungle is okay if you buy the one with the pink label. My sister likes cuba jungle tiger and I just can't figure out why :)It doesn't last half as long as the other scents which is why I don't use it. Cuba Jungle Tiger that is, seems as if it has more alcohol in it or something.Well, that's my 2 cents worth. :)"
5,This game made my childhood,The Simpsons is a tv show that started in 1989 it has become really popular and it is still going after 23 years. Then the Simpsons team took up the challenge tom
1,Mad at slow shipment,"I am extremely pissed that this item has taken so long to get here. I ordered it on Dec. 14th and it is now Dec. 24th and no game! I wanted to give it to my son for christmas! I mean come on, it comes from Florida and is supposed to go to Mississippi for crying out loud! It does not take that long to get it here!"
1,Game does not work,"This game did not work. The previous owners saved the game so we were able to start it on the second board. When we finished and got to the third board, the game cut off and an error message displayed on the screen. After restarting the game and trying to go to the first board, we got the same error message. I hope all of the games from this person are not like this."
2,Could be much better.....,"When I first started playing this game, it seemed great because I was finally able to walk through the Simpsons universe freely. But as I got farther into the game, the missions became so repetitive that it became extremely boring. Every mission has about 5 other missions in the game that are nearly identical. And if you are expecting it to be a Simpson's version Grand Theft Auto, you are going to be disappointed. I would recommend this game to rent, but not to buy, just for the experience of walking and driving around Springfield."
4,Grand Theft Auto. Meet the Simpson Family.,"Overall, this game is actually pretty good. Aside from the few gameplay issues and graphical glitches here and there, the game is great. The controls are responsive (although sometimes a bit too touchy) and the loading screen is good. You get to collect coins and cards along the way to obtain new gear for your character. I love the ninja costume for Bart! Typical Simpsons humor is laden throughout the interactive city. Before I forget, there are even ""unique"" jumps that is prominent in Grand Theft Auto. The only major con that I have noticed is that the storyline is weak, and I wish Vivendi would develop it more. Overall, this may be the beginning of a good franchise for Vivendi in the future. If you come in expecting Grand Theft Auto, you will be disappointed, but if you think Grand Theft Simpson, then you will be a happy clam."
3,Not bad but not great,"This is the second Simpsons video game I bought. This one is alot more involved with the charcters and the story line than the other, but it isn't the easiet game to complete. I have been stuck on the same area for a month, to a point where I had to walk away from the game and try something else. if you love the Simpsons, you will love this game."
3,"Good, but not great","At first this game was really pretty fun, but it started to get old, with pretty much all you do is do timed missions or races. and the missions are pretty much always ""fetch me this"" kind of thing. On a better note, the way you drive is really fun, letting you slide around tight corners"
3,not good for beginner!!!,"Well ..... I thought that the beginners have to start guessing that the use of nunchuks!! but it just goes to show how to fight it! It was expected to be due to some initial training film to get my hands!! Well I'm disappointed! may show what's going in the movie!but, was basically not bad!"
3,Only one flaw;,"The internal spring is not corrosion proof, so use in saltwater is a short-lived event, about 1 year in my case, I am ordering my second one and will be sure to soak the spring with silicone spray before and after each use to try and extend the life. A non-metal spring might have been a better idea though. Other than that I can say it will hold the unit in place no matter how rough the conditions are."
5,Gracious insider observations into a compromised 'Ministry',"A former Graham campaign worker explains his 'dilemma'; Whether to be silent on the compromise riddling the Graham Evangelistic Assoc. or to provide a gracious expose and suffer the abuses to follow. Pastor Hulse does an excellent job of explaining the doctrinal and methodological errors countenanced by this huge worldwide phenomenon which is the Graham Assoc. Hulse's desire, I believe, is to honor the Lord and His Word in exposing error and promoting sound biblical teaching. He is not caustic or bitter in the least in his fine volumn. I heartily recommend this book to all who want to understand what is beneath the veneer in this ostensibly biblical evangelical Christian organization. Every Pastor and christian worker should read this so as to warn and guard their flock from these subtle errors which are, and have been, encroaching upon unsuspecting and undiscerning Christians."
3,Ink life,Ink has good color production if only it last longer. Cartridge is just too small to expect a longer lasting cartridge. Can get around 10 4x6 pictures.
5,Canon Ink Cartridge,"The Canon ink cartridges for photo printers is very good. The color quality is amazing, and so easy to use, in a printer. I have used this product for over a year, and won't use anything else."
3,panasonic ew 3003w,im still looking for an accurate wrist blood pressure monitor. i'm a registered nurse. i've measured this cuff against a manual pressure and this one measures 15--16 points higher on the systolic(upper number). the walmart omron that's $10.00 higher in price was more inaccurate than this one--upper and lower numbers were inaccurate. i'v taken to the internet to search for one. ds
4,the least crazy wrist BP monitor,"Just bought this Panasonic EW-3037-s. I am a 150 sys average if checked at the doc office, and my wife is the opposite. We used to have an omron hem 637 where it gives me reading of 170's sys, 180's sys, 150's. Never gives number within 2-5 units from different tests. As for my wife, the omron hem 637, gives consistently low numbers. 70's dias and down to low 60's. The sys counts are either in the 80,s or the 90's.Well, finally i got to meet this good looking bp mon. Not only pretty in look but also pretty in the inside.five to 10 tests i just made, the numbers only change within 5 mm/Hg - both upper and lower numbers.My bp now is similar to my do's count, and my wife's now has a 120's/80's.The only thing I am not sure of is whether they're all created equal.Highly recommend it..."
1,not reproducible,"The monitor looks really nice, small and stylish, that is probably it. It is probably the worst monitor we have tried. Yes, we read all of the instructions and did the measurement exactly as suggested. The worst part is that you can measure it five times and you would get five totaly different numbers. We returned it and bought a Omron cuff based monitor."
2,not very well made,not very sturdy. we have a toddler around and he can pull it down...which is scary. Not recommended if you have small children.
2,needs to be shorter,My doors measure 79 inches. My polder ironing board is 71. When I put it on the hanger the board would not clear the floor. I wasn't going to go through the hassle of returning it so I decided to tweak the angle of the hooks that hold the legs....one almost broke off. It is now used to hang a variety of light weight shopping bags. I'm very disappointed in the quality..not to mention it doesn't work with the POLDER ironing board that I have. Just check your measurements.
1,macabre Chinese puzzle pieces,you have to get these pieces just right otherwise the 2(two!!!) pieces that make up the hooks holding the board's legs will come apart and you will be SOOL! Just prop your board inside your closet and be done with it.
1,Don't waste your money.,This hangar is not at all what I expected. It barely holds a Y type ironing board as shown in the picture. The hangar wants to twist away from the door when the board is placed in it. It will not lay flat. Once assembled it is very loose and sloppy. It is not a quality product. I recommend purchasing a unit that actually bolts/screws to the wall or door. Don't waste your time or money on this item.
1,Not what I expected,This product says 'Over the door/Wall Mount' which I thought meant that it can either be mounted to a wall or hung over a door. It can only be hung over a door but not mounted to a wall which is what I wanted with the product.
1,cheap,"This product is flimsy. I don't recommend. The two hooks left and right just slide into a metal loop. When hanging the ironing board on it, the weight will cause it to shift left or right."
2,Superficial,"I found the contents of this book to be very generic and almost superficial. The comments were at times so generic, they were meaningless. If you are a 7th grader ""dreaming"" of buying a business some day, maybe this book is good enough. If you are serious about buying a business, and want concrete advice, examples and guidance, than look elsewhere. I found BUYOUT, by Rick Rikertsen much more informative; while it dealt with somewhat larger business transactions than most would be involved in, the advice and examples apply to buying any size business. Spend the little extra and get BUYOUT."
4,"Complete, realistic and a requirement for small biz buyers","This is the second book I have read regarding buying a business, and I have found it to be extremely informative whether you are buying a business in the middle market (the market the book covers), or a smaller business. The book covers a methodology to follow, what to expect from a seller, who to get involved, and even has sample forms for your use. In fact, I used the Intent to Purchase agreement in the book for an offer, and was told by my lawyer that it was the most comprehensive he has seen, one he plans to put into his 'Hall of Fame' Folder."
4,Great Insight and Ideas for Business Acquisition Strategies,"Great insight and ideas from someone who has 30+ yrs practical experience in business acquisitions.Introductory chapters do a good job explaining broad overview of why and how people buy businesses. Subsequent chapters detail specific stages of the business buying process. Offers many rules-of-thumb useful for practical application.Robb is a first time writer and some of the material seems to repeat itself. While ""Buying Your Own Business"" isn't great flowing narrative, it certainly tells you what you need to know if you've considered taking the plunge and becoming your own boss."
5,Very cute chinese legend.,"Beautifully illustrated Chinese folk tale.We especially enjoyed this book since we have a siamese cat and are in the process of adopting from China.Very cute story of why the siamese cats have black tails, feet, and ears."
5,Excellent even on its own,"I have to disagree slightly with the first reviewer: this CD was the first dB's music I ever heard, and I loved it. So I don't think the listener will be lost without the studio albums. Of course it helps to know what the standout tracks are--I recommend starting with my favorite, track 23, The Death Of Rock, and track 26, Spy in the House of Love. Then listen to tracks 13-20 straight through, all of them are great. The other tracks I put on my mix tape were 4, 10, 11.I'd say 13 great tracks on a grab-bag CD like this qualifies as 5-star material. One more comment on the dB's: the demo version of Spy in the House of Love on this CD is *way better* than the studio version on the Like This album. For some reason that whole album was produced in the manner of cheesy mid-80s Top-40 pop, while the Sound of Music album is great, sounding like the jangly pop made famous by early REM. But I digress.Ride The Wild Tom Tom is a great CD."
5,Children in Need of Special Care,The book is very helpful to me. They speak so nice about 'special child' who actually is a child who needs 'special care' and 'special understanding'. It is the adults (parents and caretakers) who must change their attitudes towards their kids. It also explains many specific features you may find in your kids and sees deeply into their whole human beings. It also recommends alternative ways to take good and special care for those in need.
4,good player but want the new one,"I sorta agree with the new yorker guy on why he'd rather buy a cheap mp3 playing cd player than an expensive minidisc player if all you want to do is listen to music. however! He neglects to mention the one thing about minidisc that makes it far superior to and far more versatile than cd-r / mp3 players, that being, with the appropriate player that has a mic input, you can RECORD ANYTHING ANYWHERE. This e909 player is outdated and doesnt take advantage of minidisc's full potential so i can see why one would never want to get this. But with most of the new player/recorders especially the MZ-N10 from Sony, you can use minidisc to record audio for video projects, record conversations, concerts, record from cd players or the computer audio (MOD, XM and other chip tune files) via line in or optical in. All you need is a good shotgun microphone..."
4,A Look at a Fascinating People,"These stories paint a picture of a time, society, and culture foreign to me. Some are emotionally difficult to read, and none are light-hearted fluff. They are fascinating and written by, I feel, a warm-hearted man. I enjoyed them and recommend them for anyone interested in the details of daily living of 19th Century Eastern European Jewish children."
5,bought it for harry potter stuff,"So, I wrote to the bathroom reader's institue and asked if there was any books with Harry Potter info in it, and they referred me to this book that supposedly had two articles. The HP articles were just ok, but overall, the book was pretty cute."
2,They all sound the same,"I bought this based on what Julianna Margolies (The Good Wife) said about the singer on David Letterman. I was hopeful, because of the song selections, there would be some variety in his presentation, but they all sound the same no matter what the song."
4,Oddly enjoyable,I heard a tape of Max Palast while preparing for an SRL show. One of the gems of this album is the cover of Tainted Love.
5,Beautiful,"Looks great. The whole thing is chrome, not just the Logo. Really dressed up my truck. The Chrome seems to be high quality although I have not had it long enough to see how it holds up."
3,good mounts at a fair price,This is a good option if you do not want to spend too much. There are couple of catches that I think you should be aware of:1. Mounts are made of plastic2. There is no conduit built within the mount through which you can run speaker wire.
2,Poor service from J. B.,"I ordered these on Dec. 8, as a gift for Christmas. I paid extra for an ""expedited"" shipment, as I needed it by Dec. 21, when we were leaving for our celebration. The projection was that I would receive it by Dec. 12. The shipment was ""missent"" and I never knew when it might arrive. Everyday when I tracked shipment, the expected date would change to a later date. According to my post office, it finally arrived on Dec. 24, but by then our mail was being held. No present for Christmas. When we finally got the package, it was exactly what we wanted."
3,Not great,"These mounts are not great. They are a cheap plastic, and are a little over complicated. The instructions are confusing and the mounts don't go together the way they say. The plastic washer will not fit in the mounting bracket if you need to put it in for keyhole mounting. I just screwed the mounts right into the wood speakers, and it worked better. The extensions and flex extenders are secure enough but they are just held on by a tightening screw, no screw actually goes through for a secure hold it just applies pressure. All in all they are ok, low profile and serve their purpose. They do sag if set up in a certain way, but you can tighten them to fix that. I guess I would recommend getting these because they are fairly cheap and hold your speakers up."
1,Junk,These are just too flimsy to support a ten pound speaker. I tried but they sagged and looked like they would eventually fail. Tossed them out a bought metal ones.
2,Maybe good?,"I bought these mounts to go with my Onkyo home theater system but they didn't work. Though it says they work with speakers up to 10 lbs, and my speakers weighed only about 8 lbs, the mounts wouldn't hold. In their defense I was mounting them to an angled facing, but no matter how much I tightened the fitting the speakers sagged. I ended up fabricating my own mounts."
3,"I had a problem, but got it resolved","When I first ordered these speaker mounts, I thought ""What a deal"". But after mounting them, I didn't have the same feeling. In fact I had to go out and buy new ones to replace a couple of them that seemed as though they were broke from the beginning. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a new set of them. Now I am completely satisfied. Thank you very much."
3,decent speaker mounts,"These are some really good mounts for very light weight speakers....my speakers were around 4 lbs,they worked okay fpr my speakers.The instructions given with this mounts are as confusing as it could be. Took me a while to figure it out ....overall its a decent mount system !"
5,Great Speaker Mounts,Great speaker mounts at a great price. Very Very is to install comes with everything that you need. I should buy them again if needed. Get in on a great deal.
4,Mike Harris and David T. Chastain,"Progressive power metal bands are growing by the dozen, but on occasion one band will find the talent and originality to stand apart from the rest. Zanister is without a doubt one of those bands. With their sophomore effort guitarists Michael Harris and power metal legend David T. Chastain (Spike, Chastain, CJSS) hold true to their band's name, which means ""Sophisticated Intensity."" They are joined by vocalist Brian Sarvela formerly of The Reign of Terror, Brian Harris on drums, and James Martin on bass.With a wail that reflects the power-ballads of the early nineties ""Generation Breakdown"" seems to turn back time, but other songs like ""Egyptian Nights"" and ""Hell on Earth,"" show a clearer version of the metal influence behind the band and will remind fans of bands like Savatage, Queensryche, and Dream Theater without mimicking them."
5,Well written and engaging.,"This story may not follow the TV series canon precisely, but it's very nicely written and hard to put down. I found myself totally caught up in Ben Cartwright's early life, experiencing all the joy and sadness along with him. I would highly recommend this book and all of Calder's Bonanza books for any fans of the TV series."
2,Not at all good,"I could not wait for this game to come out. I loved the first one, this one however is awful. You can easily get lost in this game. The first one was more action packed this one is like stratagy and is complicated. The camera and controls suck. You can kill vampires and demons easier, but when your fighting and are near death you have medi packs. You can't like the first game pause take elixar and then unpause it you have to continue playing and stop what you are doing in order to take the medi pack, while you are still under attack."
5,Buffy 4 Eva,"The first game was great, but the only problem was you couldn't pick any other character. In the new one you can pick Willow, Buffy, Faith, or Xander. So you know this game has got to be good."
3,Entertaining..But doesn't live up to the first Buffy game,"Ok...Vivendi commited the cardinal sin...They messed with a previously perfect gameplay engine...Player control was wonderful in the first game, frustrating in this installment...-Graphics are not as crisp as they were in the first game but this is because this is a multi-platform game and had to be ""dumbed-down"" for the other consoles that cannot displays graphics as well as the X-Box.-The camera is terrible...don't try to mess with it..You'll only get more frustrated...-Multiplayer is fun but not as great as Vevendi hyped it up to be...-If you like the first one, you'll probably be dissapointed...But still an enjoyable game!"
2,Buy on sale,"I am a HUGE buffy fan and bought the game the day it came out. i was surprised that it was nothing like the first game. very jerky. There were puzzles to solve, but none that were that challenging. This game was definitely released before the bugs were worked out. The camera movement is so frustrating i almost couldn't play the game. Can't see through walls and can't move out or see what you are doing if you get cornered. Very glitchy. freezes & codes for spells don't work. There is also a huge delay between when you press the button and what the character actually does. And just try changing directions during a fight!!The voice of Willow is horrible, and the sexual inuendo is a bit pathetic. The quality of the graphics is not as good as the previous Buffy game. I wish they would have waited to release this game and hadn't rushed to get it out. I want my money back!!!"
4,meh,"I was a big fan of the first game. I tore right through it in a few days. Sadly, chaos bleeds is not nearly as good. I've gotten through a few levels, and while I am sure I will eventually finish it, I am in no big hurry.It has been mentioned that the camera angles are funky...that they are...I really wanted to like this game...I was itching to play it...but sadly...hasn't lived up to my expectations..."
3,Disappointing...,"My main complaint is the same that I've read on here all ready but I'll repeat - the camera angles are horrible. The inability to move the camera to a suitable position makes certain tasks needlessly difficult. It makes a fairly enjoyable game somewhat tedious.It is nice to have a variety of characters to play and larger environments to explore but, overall, the first game was much more enjoyable."
3,NOT WHAT BUFFY GAMING USED TO BE,"The first game (OUTSTANDING) this game (NOT) I had read a fewso-so review about this game and even though my wife and I really wanted to buy it. I decided to rent it first and just check it out, so glade I did. Terrible camera angles, can't look up, can't turn if anything is near me. Buffys voice is also Anya's (No diffence at all, very pathetic voice casting on this part) Willow's voice is HERRIBLE!! Man-o-Man is it ever. Vampires are much harder. Charaters you play much slower. Graphics are much less impressive then the first. RENT IT FIRST"
5,Buffy The Vampire Slayer for Xbox,Great game. I am a big buffy fan. Love buffy like crazy. Love being able to be a slayer even if it is for pretend.
4,Buffy ROCKS!,"Buffy: Chaos Bleeds is a spectacular game. I have the first game, so when I bought Chaos Bleeds, I had high expectations. The game was even better than I even thought it would ever be. It has amazing weaponry, it has difficult yet fun puzzles, and the graphics rock! My advice is to BUY THIS GAME NOW, BEFORE THEY ARE ALL GONE!!!!"
3,It needs work,"This game is okay but it's not as good as the first one. It's worth (barely) playing through once but it doesn't have any replay value because it's just TOO hard. I want to puch and kick and kill Vampires when I play a Buffy game. I don't want to solve frustrating puzzles for a million hours. I just want to fight a fair fight. Chaos Bleeds has too many puzzles and too many monsters on the screen at one time. They should let you increase the size of your health bar after every level like the first game.I'm a major Buffy fan but I didn't care much for Chaos Bleeds. It's cool to play as Spike and Faith and Willow but it's not worth it if you have to fight in impossible odds. I beat this game and just stuck it on a shelf. I hope they make a ""Angel"" game that is better than this."
2,Nowhere near as good as the first,"I loved the first Buffy game, a superb action game. The second installment in the series is a major dissapointment, which I hope the developer will view as a mistake. The camera is the worse I have ever seen and you'll want to kill your x-box, especially during jumping sequences. They changed a lot of things I liked about the first game, such as the wider camera view and the exciting fighting sequences. Combat in Chaos bleeds is boring in comparison and is apparently made for a younger gamer with its oversized characters and easier fighting. I wanted to like this game because I'm a fan of the show, but, unfortunately, its not very good. I find myself constantly trying to adjust the camera when fighting or exploring new locations. The game feels like it was rushed to the shelves, and the horrible camera takes away from some new cool features, including fighting with a sword."
3,Not Bad!,"I rented this game and found it quite addicting. I have no problem with using specific characters with different levels, however, I do find the camera angles to be hard to work with. If you're next to something, you can't move the camera around. The first Buffy game was much better with the camera. All enemies are harder to kill and have trickier moves, but I think that just adds more of a challenge to the game. I do wish that they had different experience levels like in the first game though. The puzzles are definitly harder and I had to go to the site for help with a few things as well. All in all I think this is a great game and I plan on buying it when the price comes down a bit. Oh and Willow's voice is REALLY BAD."
5,The story ...,"OK, take the first time and add better graphics, more playable characters and multiplayer option, that's what this game is. Play as Buffy, Faith or some one else. The short E3 video was enough for me to see that this game is just as good or better then the first one. The lay-out on the screen is almost the same as with the first game. You have health, slayerpower and your weapons on the left side of the screens."
2,Not as good as the original,"The original ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" xbox game was much better. The original has a much better fight engine that is not nearly as buggy and it's a quality game made by electronic arts. Chaos Bleeds gives you more options as you change persona's but is very buggy and frustrating, Playing as Spike is almost comical as he is slow and choppy.If you don't have the original get it and see for yourself."
4,Definitely not the bottom for UM.,Not a b-side disc. Bottom Half can hold it's own as one of UM's best.
2,A real disappoiontment...,"This album is a real disappointment. I have Umphrey's first album, which made me think they were talented. This double album proves they are not. No creative depth. Their tank is empty."
5,Don't skip the introduction,"This is truly an extraordinary book, worth reading again and again. I recommend it for white people, to help remove our blinders to the existence of the river of resistance to oppression and the opportunity to be part of it.Do not skip the introduction. The paragraph about the reaction Martin Luther King's desire to ""redeem the soul of America"" is worth the price of the book."
2,There is a River,Unless you are into slave history this is a very boring rerpeptive book. I read it as required reading but wouldn't recommend it.
3,As if the show's not becomming unbearable,"I loved the first two cd's. But, ...this cd is zzzzz, oh sorry it's playing in the background. Vonda Sheppard who usually is great sounds like she's going through the motions here. I mean how is it possible to do a bad version of ""For Once in My Life""?... And, don't get me started on the inclusions of Robert Downey Jr. It's not that he has a bad voice-it's kinda like someone doing a bad Springsteen at karaoke! The best songs on this cd are by Tina, Barry & Al Green. Maybe David E> Kelley should shell out the money for royalties of old recordings next time."
4,"Good grooves, chill and enjoy","I enjoyed this cd more than I thought I would - not being that much of an Ally McBeal fan. Vonda Shepard has an impressive voice and Robert Downey Jr was surprisingly good also! Al Green, Sting and Tina Turner topped it off perfectly. Good kick back and chill music."
4,A Great Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is great. With the weather getting warmer it is the perfect cd to accompany long drives with the window down. A great mix of music feature classics like Tina Turner, and Barry White!! Robert Downey Jr's addition's are definatly worth the money for this cd!-Now if only he could get his life straightened out. As Always, Vonda Shephard is a treat. All in All, I would definatly recommend buying this cd-I am sure glad that I did!!"
5,PHENOMENAL ALBUM,"The album is a well produced, diverse representation of the best that Ally's music has to offer. Robert Downey's 3 tracks exceeded my expectations. Vonda's ""Reason to Believe"" is great. Will be in the number one slot of my CD player for quite a long time."
2,Marketing Masterminds Messed Up,"Anticipation turned to disappointment when I found Vonda's lastest chapter has been sadly diluted by Sony Marketing. Robert Downey Jr.'s efforts are simply not up to standard. Al Green's ""How Do You Mend a Broken Heart"" is unlistenable. But Vonda's versions of ""Reason to Believe"" and ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" are peerless. It's too bad that her version of ""Young Love"", featured in a recent 'Ally' episode did not make the cut. Next time - more Vonda."
3,For Once in My Life not as good as previous Ally efforts,"There is no question that the previous Ally McBeal music collections were superior to this new effort from Vonda Shepard, and Robert Downey Jr.(Who will probably be in jail again by April's end)The best songs include a Shepard/Downey duet, ""Chances Are"", and another duet with Downey and Sting, of Sting's classic ""I'll be watching you"" Despite these sucesses. the rest consists of mainly melancholy melodies one after another. My advice: Get the first two cd's before this one, but if your a die hard Ally fan, then get this now. Good Listening."
2,Vonda Shepard is the problem,"Stand along songs by Ms. Shepard fall short. This tape would have been better if more artists were allowed to perform as they do in the program. Alone, Ms. Shepard just doesn't have it in my opinion."
4,The Best One To Date,"Another Ally McBeal soundtrack but this one is the best yet. For Once In My Life is a pretty mixed bag really, the core of it is based around Vonda Shepard, but there are other artists like Tina Turner (When The Heartache Is Over), Love Is Alive (vonda and Anastacia) and Chances Are (Vonda and Robert Downey Jr). This cd is the one out the series that is the best to have as its the most complete to date and the standard of songs is so high"
5,Enjoyed the music in this CD,I bought this CD for Robert Downey Jr's songs on this CD and loved it. I also enjoyed Vonda'slovely voice and songs.
5,Best Ally McBeal Collection Yet,"I can't more ADAMANTLY disagree with the Amazon.com editor on this one. There is no question that this Ally McBeal music collection is superior to previous efforts from Vonda Shepard, altho I've liked them all. Vonda's voice tends to grate on me after a while, so I was glad to see tracks on this CD from Al Green, Barry White, Tina Turner, and, of course, Robert Downey, Jr. ""Chances Are"" is rivaled only by Downey, Jr.'s version of ""River"" on the Ally McBeal Christmas CD."
2,A picture book,"Somebody said that wars are too important a thing to leave them to military men. I would say that the history of the jesuit missions is too important a thing to leave it to jesuits. The book is a collection of bromides and uncritical descriptions of the mission's history. Very light and uninformative, the UN funds that went into it should have been better spent. The pictures are very nice and well printed, and are worth the money."
1,Public Domain footage freely available (in DVD quality) from archive.org,"Do NOT spend a single dime on this item, please.This is a blatant rip-off of a DVD created by me a few years ago (from high-quality Public Domain footage freely downloadable from archive.org) to be shared freely via bittorrent.This seems to be an EXACT copy of what I compiled, down to the sequence of contents."
3,guala's bronzing mess!,"I love the color, and how this combo looks on me, specially if I'm a bit tanned.... but, as i am constantly on the go, I'd take this compact with me... and the palette cakes broke super easy! leaving a mess everywhere I carried them, so I bought the second duo, left the other one back home..... the same happened! after a month or so, it broke off in powdery pieces all over my makeup bag!!! its a nice product... just leave it on your makeup drawer! never take it for a ride!"
1,Go for the Fisher Price Potty on the Go instead!,"The potty this was designed for looks like it should work fine even though the liner doesn't fit well it's tiny - fits in a back pack or in the glove compartment or under a seat. And the price is right...until you try to use it. My son cried, it hurt him. Urine went everywhere. He had a red mark on his bottom even though he was just on it for a couple of minutes. I should have just found a discreet bush. I bought the replacement potty mentioned in the title and found it to be perfect in every way. Don't waste your money."
5,"Nice to have, but...","I gave this item 5 stars because it performs well, is cheap, and was described accurately. It is basically a specially-sized, handled bag with an attached absorbant pad to soak up wetness. I really loved these for our recent week-long backpacking trip around Europe. I liked the convenience of having the bags ready with the pad inside and so neatly packaged.However, for regular use we buy the smallest size of trash bags and toss a disposable nursing pad inside. Perfect! I keep an extra ziploc with a roll of bags and a corresponding number of nursing pads in our car at all times, replenishing as needed. I was skeptical of the need for an absorbant pad at first, but now I prefer it. If you aren't going to be able to dispose of the potty bag immediately, you definitely don't want to be carrying around a baggie with a cup of pee inside!I would purchase these again for a specific trip, but for everyday use I prefer the trash bag/disposable pad method."
4,BE CAREFUL! TWO DIFFERENT POTTY REFILLS~,"I bought these liners to fit our potette, which we love. What I didn't know until now is that there are TWO Potettes... the Potette and the Potette PLUS. The latter has handles that lock in the flat position for use on a standard toilet seat. Apparently the other potty seat does not do this. These liners are for the regular Potette which is slightly smaller than our Potette Plus. They do not fit!!! Make sure you are buying the correct size. Otherwise they work as described, and my daughter likes the little turtles on the bottom. That teeny pad doesn't absorb much of anything, but she insists on peeing on the turtles, lol! So afterward I throw in a couple of paper towels and we're good to go. I have some leftover nursing pads and those work great too."
3,Misleading for the toilet it fits,"Sadly, I didn't realize that there are two types of the potette potties. I have the Potette Plus. It is amazing! I love it!! My daughter loves it. And in a couple of years, I hope my son will love it. Can't say enough wonderful things about the toilet! It works on a big toilet great. It folds up into a diaper bag. It works as a stand alone. Just a wonderful tool for toddlers and preschoolers.BUT - make sure you note which refill you are getting. I gave it three stars because Amazon recommends buying the Kalencom Potette Plus & On the Go Potty Liner Re-Fills 10-Pack, along with the toilet and the product on this page. Don't do it! Check to see which toilet you have/are ordering and make sure you get the right refill. This refill does NOT fit the Potette Plus.Lesson learned for me!"
4,Potette Liners,"The liners are rather a snug fit on the potette so are not particularly eas to get on, but the end result is fabulous - hygienic and easily disposable."
5,Awesome for little ones,"I love the portable potty and disposable liners. Very compact and so much better than having to use a public restroom with little ones. The kids love using it to! Bags tie up with no mess. We keep it in the car at all times and have taken it with us for air travel, or just an excursion to the park. Highly recommended."
4,Perfect for first few weeks of potty training,We really liked the portable potty and liners. They were great for when we were on the road or at the park and there were no real toilets nearby.
4,potty emergency,"I bought this product when my daughter was beginning potty training. I feared that during the long road trip to Grandma's house that she would need to go when there wasn't anywhere to go. Thankfully, she did better than I expected. We've had to use this a few times and are really happy with it. It is small. This is definitely for little kids (toddler or small preschool). The bags are nice because it can be disposed of later if there isn't a place handy. I love how it's so compact in the car!"
5,Don't leave home without it.,"My toddler uses this almost every day. From the earliest days of potty learning it has been great to have a clean, convenient, and familiar potty anywhere on a few second's notice. Really does fold up to fit in a shoulder bag or stroller cargo area. Liners are great, but a little pricy. I use produce bags to good effect, although there are some situations, like on a long hike when we are committed to carrying out ALL waste, when the absorbent completely sealing bags are really worth it. Whenever I get it out for my little girl, all the other parents ask, ""Where can I get one TODAY?"" I would buy it again at twice the price."
5,On The Go Potty Liner Re-Fills,"This product is a life saver, especially when you are on long trips. Very convenient and easy to use."
1,doesn't work.,"Look, this needs some sort of instructions. My TV doesn't have a super-v socket. Which many people's won't. So I went to Tandy (Radio Shack) and got a scart adaptor just to use it. When I finally get resolution settings right, it'll still only output to black and white. It's going back I'm afraid. Oh, and to the user who says anyone who can't set this up, we shouldn't be using computers in the first place? Well, whatever... Let's not play flame-wars. But I've been using macs and PC's for 18 years - but when you do something new you need a hand. At this price there's no excuses for a missing out a proper setup brochure with troubleshooting sections."
5,Kindergarten Delight,Our son's kindergarten teacher has been reading from this book each week. The class loves it!
3,Nice Book,"Not as fun as the ""original"" Uncle Wiggily stories from when I was a child, but along the same lines and my children enjoy them. I have my book from the 1960's that my Great-Grandmother read to me, and my children loved it so much they wanted more! We bought this book to continue the fun. The stories are sweet and keep the kids entertained."
5,Wholesome Book,"Wholesome book. Though I do like it, don't read it after you have read Uncle Remus...IF you do, you may find this book boring.I like the good lessons taught."
2,Not really that great,"I had read all the great reviews on this book and thought ""Wow this looks like it would be an awesome book!"" So I was SOOOOO happy when I realized that my library had it. Boy was I glad! I would have been so disappointed. There were a couple of really cute things in there but nothing I would really spend my time on. Overall I just think that it's ok."
2,Lo-Budget? Yes. Hi-Style? No.,"I was disappointed. Most of this stuff looks trashy. The only thing I want to make is the tshirt rag rug. Everything else just didn't seem appealing. Check this out at the library first, like I did!"
2,Too basic and too little for the cost of the book,I returned this book because it only has 20 projects and too many of them are very basic and more appropriate for grade school arts and crafts. I had bought 5 books on crafting with recycled items and was amazed at the ingenuity and creativity that the books contained. This book was just not on par with the other 4 books.
3,A sequel with Jim Button,"After finishing Jim Button and Luke the Engin Driver my 6 years old daughter and I wanted to read more about Jim and Luke. In this sequel we follow the two friends through alot of adventures, all the time for good. Jim learns his origin story, and everything gets a happy ending.Michael Ende has a fantastic way of writing, and this is also absolutely an Ende book, but in many ways my memories of Jim would have been better if there were only the first book. This second one can not be compared to the first, it is long, and you never get to any good points. I still like it though, but both my daughter and I were happy to start something new after these more than 300 pages.Britt Arnhild Lindland"
1,What happened?,"Hello to the new author of Thoroughbred #24! What happened? Chris was a happy little baby, now she is a spoiled little brat, and even more in #25! Sammy and Princess And Tor and Everybody! Joanna Cambell come back!! We need some real reading material.! About RACING! This book is digusting, and so is #25! END"
1,WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OK i'm on chapter 5 and it already sticks! this was the only series that had to deal with Horse RACING!!!! please make the book go back to racing. I was getting tips off them because i want to be a jockey and now we go to 3 day eventing???? come on Joanna help us out here there your series!!!! Kristina Hershey please write back JO
5,What happened to this series??!!,"Dear Joanna, I have read THE HORSE OF HER DREAMS, and what I didn't understand is that in #23 Christina was 2, now she's 12! Also, in ASHLIEGH'S CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, when Christina turned 10, Ashliegh was dead ,sad :( , now when Christina is 12 Ashliegh is alive.Not that I wanted Ashliegh to die, it's just that it doesn't make sense. Also, the series isn't the smae without Cindy, Sammy, Tor, Max, Heather, Mandy (you get the point). I'm only reading the series still because I still like them, but they could be a little better Sincerely, Katie"
1,Dissapointed,"I own all the Thoroughbread Books and have Read them at least twice. I love them now- except this one. WHAT HAPPENED TO CINDY, MAX, SAMMY, TOR (who would move to Irland when you gust got a job as assistant trainer) THE NEW BABY, HALF THE HORSES? Who would give up Wounders last foal? And the main character doesn't race- give me a break! Since when would Ashley not let someone ride and let Chris ""stand on the table and have her not notice""? WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FAVORIS BOOKS?"
1,I have some questions that I would like to be answered,"How could Ashleigh do this? Only Mike protested. This book needs a lot of ajustments. Like why did Sammy leave? What happened to the barn cats? What happened to all the old characters? What happened to Len? What ever happened to Honor, Glory, Champion, Precousious, Limitless Time, Fleet Street, etc.? Why skip ten years? I mean I know you needed a new character but at least get one in that year. For example why not let Charlie's neice to come to Whitebrook. Then let Samantha and Tor have a daughter and then they come back to Whitebrook. And a little message to Allison Estes, try to stay on the subject if you don't mind. If you can't do that then give the series back to Karen Bntley or Joanna Campbell."
1,It stunk!!,"I can't BELIEVE that they gave away Wonder's last foal for some stupid other horse!! what the heck happened to the Christina in Ashliegh's Christmas miracle? what happened to the foal from fleet goddess!! why does she not like racing!! i ,ean come on this is a racing series and the main character doesn't even race!! since when is Ahsleigh afraid to let someone ride!!! that is the most stupid thing i ever heard!!! they wouldn't even let Christinia ride legacy!!!! I am outraged that one of my favorite series has turned to this!!"
3,Doesn't compare to other books in the series,"I don't exactly hate this book, but I don't love it either. Even though it was created by Joanna Campbell, Allison Estes wrote it and I don't really like her style. Also, no offense to those who like her, but I think Christina is a brat. My favorite characters are 1) Ashleigh, 2) Cindy, 3) Samantha. If you have read ASHLEIGH'S CHRISTMAS MIRICLE you know how good Christina was with horses when they tell about what would have happened if Ashleigh had died. But in this book she doesn't have that special bond like Ashleigh and Cindy have with their horses. I mean, why isn't she as good with horses just because her mom's alive? Even though most of ASHLEIGH'S CHRISTMAS MIRICLE never even happened, I like Christina a lot better there. Read the book for yourself."
2,Where is everyone?,"This is an ok book, but practically everyone disapears. Cindy, Max, and a lot of the horses. A lot of people think that Christina is a brat for not wanting Legacy, but I don't think she is. Why would she want a racehorse that she can not even ride, especially since she likes event riding better. This wasn't that great a book because all the different authors keep on changing the characters and horses. These new authors really need to read the previous books and get their facts straight."
1,This Book Moved Me,"This book moved me. In fact, it moved me so deeply that I got up, walked over to the trash and almost dropped this so called book in, but then I decided it would be useful to start a fire come winter. This is probably the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. Wonder why? I'll tell you why: bad plot, incredibly bratty characters, and no explanation for a 10 year jump. What's not to love? Save your money for something else, *anything* else. This book just isn't worth it."
2,"Ok, but what happened to everyone else?","I know Ms. Campbell took some time off and she definitlydeserved it, but I think the other authors just took the series toofar away! I liked how it was going with Cindy. If they wanted a change of charecters, they shouldn't have jumped 10 years ahead! I wanted to know more about Glory and Champion. How did Honor Bright do in racing? Why did Ashleigh stop racing altogether? And what happened to the baby she was expecting?! Please, if you have any way to do this, take us back to where Cindy's Honor left off! The books just aren't as good as they used to be!"
2,(no subject),"Okay, besides the fact that this book skipped twelve years, it also was all about eventing! Thoroughbred books are about racing, not eventing! I liked these books because they were different, because they were about racing! I can read about eventing and showjumping in other series, but I want to read about racing in these books! I am glad it went back to racing in the Wonder's Legacy books, but all those in between I only read once and I usually read my books over and over waiting for new ones to come out. I didn't think it was as exciting as racing or the first books about Ashleigh an Samantha. Once Christina switches over they get better and I am reading my books over again once more. Star and Christina are the best! What happened to all the horses? Precoucious, Fleet Godess, Limitless Time, Honor, Princess, Pride, Glory, Glory's Joy, Fleet Street, Mr. Wonderful, Pride's Heart, and all the others! Bring back the horses!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS BOOK HAS BROUGHT THE SEREIS TO FAR!,"Hello? Where's the racing? Where is Cindy, Max, Samantha, etc.....? Where are the horses: Wonder, Wonder's Pride, Shining, etc.....?I DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FIVE DOLLARS FOR SOME BOOK THAT TELLS ABOUT A TOTALY DIFFERENT PERSON AND THAT HAS RECKED THE SERIES!"
3,What Happened to the Townsends?,"This was an Ok book. Like all the other reviews I will say the skip of so many years was dumb, but I have some other questions. Where are the townsends during all this. legacy is supposed to be this great horsse, so I don't think they would have said oh yeah, give him to Christina. With wonder, pride, Princess, and Mr. Wonderful they are constantly arguing, but they just give Legacy away. Thay were not real involved with Champion either. champon won the triple crown and where are they. This book was to unrealistic. It would never happen in real life."
3,"Out with the old, In with the new .","Okay, Joanna Campbell, why did u screw your series up? I read this book as soon as it came out. I constintlly asked myself, where's Cindy? Where's Sam? Oh, Sam lives in IRELAND now? Since when did SHE like EVENTING? Since when did THOROUGHBRED like EVENTING? I must say, I have EVERY BOOK IN THE THOROUGHBRED SERIES AND THIS ONE STINKS! I also have every book in the Ashliegh, Super Edition, and Ashliegh's Collection. Im glad Cindy came back and they love horseracing now, and I like the idea of the Wonder=Ashliegh and the Chistina=Star thing. I started reading the series when I was 6. Now I'm 12."
3,Where Did everyone Go?,"I thought the book was pretty good, but I hated how so many years were just skipped. For example what happened to Cindy and Max? Why did Samatha move to Ireland with Tor? What happened to the other baby Ashleigh was supposed have in #23? There is so many questions I still want answered. I did want to read about Christina but I still wish not so much was skiped. But otherwise the book was realy good. I think it's a good book because Christina had so much courage.And I loved how once she saw Sterling abusesd she decided she had to do something.I think everyone should try this book!"
1,THE WORST BOOK IN THE THOROUGHBRED SERIES,"Ok the book was AWFUL! It passes over so much time since the last book you are sitting there thinking what happened to Cindy, Max, Heather, Pride, Goddess, Princess, Glory, Champion, and Serria! Are these horses still alive or dead were they sold? Did Cindy and Max ever get married? And why did the books switch over to eventing all of a sudden? At the end of the book Christina trades Legacy for a rouge mare that has just run in a claiming race! Legacy is Wonder's last offspring and now he is gone! What was this author thinking? Is she out of her mind? This book is a discrace to the Thoroughbred series!"
2,I don't GET it!,"I love all the thoroughbred books, at least the early ones. The thing that just BUGS me is that the books CONSTANTLY contradict each other. In most of the books they say that you need 40 wins to become a real jockey, but in 25 it says you only need one! And in 21 it sat that Pride lost the Preakness, but he didn't! And if Wonder's Legacy is supposed to be Wonder's last foal than what about Star? And did all the other horses and people drop off the face of the earth when Christina suddenly appeared. When was Kevin born, by the way? I was also sooooo disappointed when Samantha turned to training jumpers."
5,Where did they all go?,"This book is a good one. I don't know why everyone said that all the characters are snobby. Ok, so Christina doesn't like racing. If I were given Wonder's Legacy, then had a chance to get Sterling Dream, I'd take Sterling. She may have owned Wonder's Legacy, but all in all, he wasn't hers. And, on another subject, what happened to Cindy? Maybe I just didn't read well enough, because I never read ever word in the book, but she dropped off the face of the book. I heard Joanna Campbell was making a book to tell what happened in those seven years, but that was months ago, and there still isn't one. So what happened? What happened to Honor? They don't mention her, Glory, Champion, or any of the old characters anymore."
2,What happened?,"Okay, I'm going to try and not be too harsh on the author of this book, but PLEASE at least mention the old characters,horses and human. I loved Cindy and Glory, and now it's like they dissapeared into thin air.Also, what about all the other champions that Whitebrook used to have? Who are all these new people and what have you done with the characters I have grown to love?And isn't this series supposed to be about racing,just like the last 23 books have? What happened???? I REALLY didn't like this book! Whoever this new author is, will you PLEASE turn this series back to racing and introduce the old characters again? PLEASE!!!!!"
3,Where have all the cowboys gone???????????,"Whatever happened to Ashligh's second kid and the Townsends and Cindy and Max and the old author? I really enjoyed this series until now. Maybe the new author should read some of the other books in the series. And they could throw a little bit of racing back into the stories. I'm too tall to be a jocky and that is my only way to actually expirence racing. The jumping is OK, but still. All we here about is Christina this, Christina that O Pu-lease!"
1,Give me a break!,"I love the tb series a lot this book gave me some disaapointments( sorry a lot of dissappointments) first thing Ashliegh is know some overprotective mother !Secondly Samantha moves to Ireland yes but with who?supposovely she is now married to the lve of her life but oplease mention these things.Thirdly where IS CINDY! I have to admit that Samantha is my favorite and why would she move to Ireland when all of her family,friends and horses9especially Sierra and Shinning) are here. I have one Gigantic problem with this book It stinks! I mean really this is a series on racing!Hellooo not on jumping! If u want to read about jumping read the Saddle Club books! Where is Ashleighs baby? Why would Asleigh sell Wonders last colt.One word of advice for the authir if ""the knewTb series"" make a book where their is a Whitebrook reniun! And legacy cmes back! K END"
2,Not that nice.,"I read ""The Horse Of Her Dreams"" recently and I was very disapointed with it. A lot of the regular characters weren't even mentioned, and it stuck me that Christina is a very ungrateful snob. I didn't like it at all! Especially when Christina traded Wonder's Legacy for Sterling Dream. How could Ashleigh have allowed that? And when did she become overprotective with Christina? She wasn't like that when Christina was a baby! I hope the next book is better."
2,UM.......Where's Everybody?,"Ok. First of all, where is everybody? Ashleigh, Sammy, Cindy? Second of all, why did Christina give up Wonder's last foal? And why did Ashleigh let her? Third of all, Karen Bentley continued the series well after Campbell stopped writing. But Alison Estes just wants to make a new series. I can't wait for the new series Campbell is writing to come out. By the way, the reason I gave this a 4 is because it is a fine book if you don't consider it part of the (previously entertaining) Thoroughbred Series."
1,don't worry they're bringing cindy back !,"finally they are bringing cindy back into the series in #43fallen star if u want to reveiw it look it up and see what its about. i thought this book was the worst book of the whole thoroughbred series it was extremly boring and pointless i was very dissapointed because what happened to cindy ,max, champion etc....all the cool and origianal characters with original names but in this book they seemed to dissapear into thin air !"
3,What Happened To Them?,"Why is this book all about eventing?Thoroubred is about racing.And why skip twelve years?I can think of plenty of other things to wright and I'm not evan an author . Why did Samantha move to Irland?What happened to Cindy and max?Have Wonder,Shinning,and Fleet Goddess had any more foals?Where are Glory and lots of the other stallions?And why is Cindy so different in Fallen Star?She used to be so nice.Also,what happened to Christinas brother or sister?I hope to find out all the answers to these questions in future books.They could all be super editions."
3,WHERE DID EVERYONE GO!!!!!!!,"Where is Wonder,Shining,Fleet Goddess and Siera go? Who ever the writer is now, please write a reunion book and tell us why Samantha moved to Ireland and left Shining at Whitebrook!! Cindy seems to have disappeared, so where did she go! I am a big Thoroughbred fan and why did you skip Christina from three to twelve?? I liked and Champion and Glory, so please bring at least some of their offspring back! PLEASE! Otherwise I might stop reading these great books! Also, why is almost the entire book about Eventing? I mean the Thoroughbred series is about Racing, right?????? Also, Cindy could have had ten more books about her and I would of read them, Same with Ashleigh and Samantha. JOANNA, PLEASE COME BACK!!!!!!! Emily, Australia"
2,Don't get your hopes up too high,"Hey all you eventing people out there! You're probebely saying thank god they finally have an eventing book! Well don't get your hopes up too high. I hate to give away endings, but I gotta tell you. After all, you probebely wouldn't guess that in book #38 Christina sells her BELOVED Sterling so she can fo off and ride race horses (not that that's a bad thing.) You just kinda get the feeling that Christina was BORN to be an eventer. This book was not so great, and it kinda gets people like all you eventing lovers out there's hopes up."
1,Excuse me?,"What the heck? What happened? I kind of liked Cindy but you got rid of her, and I just loved reading about Samantha and she's ""gone to Ireland"". And Christina is SUCH a brat. And where's Sierra? And Tor, and Mandy, and Max? You guys really screwed up. Now I'm only reading the books because they're supposed to be about horses, but even that seems to be gone. The books seem to be more about Christina, Melanie, or Cassidy's personal life, instead of what they should be about. I'm extremely disappointed, and about ready to stop reading Thoroughbred books. Joanna, I don't know what went through your head, but you need to start writing again...things can still be the way they were..."
2,at least Ashleigh's Christmas Miracle was better,"even though i like racing better, jumping wasn't that bad when i read Ashleigh's christmas Miracle cos Joanna Campbell made it interesting! Besides, there were occasional races with True Gift and Runaway or some other horse connected to Wonder's offspring!IN this horrible book, all you have is about how Christina is so bratty and keeps thinking of having her Event horse and doesn't care about Wonder's Legacy. And also, i'm sure Ashleigh is more sensible than to forbid Christina from JUST RIDING! she's like Mr McLean after Mrs McLean died and wouldn't allow Samantha to ride!i don't really think i want to buy the rest of the books unless Joanna Campbell comes back."
1,I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS,This was the worst book I have ever read. I read this book in the beginging of the year. I just recently discovered about how you can write reviews. I wanted to save people from going though the frusturion that I went though when I read it. Chirstina is a little brat. She gave away Wonder's Legacy. I had the hole seres of the Thoroughbred up to this one. I will not read another Thoroughbred until Jonanna Campbell comes back. Please Come Back.
5,HELP,I have read some of these books. But i only have up to #8 and i can't find any of the rest. ] I have been looking for the last year can anyone help me???? If you know of any place on the net or a place I can write PLEASE tell me. Thanks
1,One of the worst Thoroughbred books I have read,"This was one of the worst Thoroughbred books I have read. Christina is such a brat. And in Cindy's Honor, Ashleigh was pregant again. What happened to the baby? Why did Samantha move? Where is Cindy? And there is no way that the Townsends would let any of this happen. Karen Bently was a great writer compared to Allison Estes. There are too many questions left unanswered. I would not recommend this book."
2,I got some questions.,"What ever happened to Cindy? She was never mentioned in this book. I was disappointed with this book. The Thouroughbred series is about horse racing, not jumping. Joanna Campbell is the best author of the series, Karen Bently is okay, but this other one changed the whole subject just about. Who is the Terminator? Why is Samantha in Ireland? Why and how did the Griffins aquire so much staff all of a sudden? I am wondering this and I think a lot of people are who read this book. I just don't get it. Where did will come from? Somebody please respond. Sincerely, Emily Whitney"
2,WHERE IS EVERYBODY??????,"WHAT HAPPENED?!?!? Did this whole series just fall apart? This is a pretty good book if youv'e never read the Thoroughbred books before,but if you have your'e probably wondering where all the people went-Cindy,Max,Samantha,Tor,Yvonne,Mandy.....And What About The HORSES?? What happened to the series? I know they fixed it and turned it back to racing,but still,it leaves the whole eventing epidemic just it's own story! It's like Thoroughbred Ashleigh:RACING Thoroughbred 1-23:EVENTING Thouroughbred 34 and beyond:RACING(hopefully) If this is your first Thoroughbred book,read in order up to 33,then go to #1 and read up from there,(skipping the ones youv'e read before) and pretend the ones youv'e read before were a tottaly different series."
2,I can't handle it!!!!,"Okay, I've been reading this series ever since I was in elementary school. I'm nineteen now, by the way. Anyway, as the series progressed I kept noticing continuity errors. But this book takes the freaking cake. Seriously. Where the HECK does Melanie fit in? Look, I like the girl. Really, I do. But no matter how I wrack my brains I cannot imagine any chance for her to exist. If Mike had a sister, why wasn't she at his and Ashleigh's wedding? Heck, most future sister-in-laws are made bridesmaids. The series NEVER mentioned Mike having a sister. EVER.Oh, and I hate Christina. And Dylan. Just saying. What's up with Mona, too? AFAIK she and Ashleigh never saw each other again after she moved, and how they're best friends? Does every adult in this darn series have to be connected?Sadly, guys, it just gets worse from here. I eventually gave up on the series because of the continuity errors."
1,What?,"What about Charlie? I know he is dead, but he was such a great trainer, and Ashleigh's friend. He should atleast be mentioned now and then."
1,why joanna? why'd you let estes do this to you?,"this book is an abomination to the series and what it stands for. the books were about unlikely women who made it big in racing. now we're forced to endure tales of a spoiled, selfish brat, her wimpy workaholic mother, her almost non-existent father, and a psychologically damaged horse. I have a few questions. 1) Where is everyone, and why are they there? 2) When did everyone get a personality transplant? 3)Why didn't Ashleigh have to consult the Townsends before letting Christina trade Legacy for the psycho horse? they own half of him. I, unlike Christina, only want one thing, and that's to end this tyranny. So, Ms. Campbell, what do you say? Can you grant me my wish? Oh, and Estes needs to stick to her series. The book may have been well-written, but I find content a little more appealing. Something this book has none of. ~ANOTHER ANGRY READER~"
2,Upsetting,"When I read ""The Horse of Her Dreams"" I was extremely upset by how everything had changed. I really loved the books about Ashleigh and Samantha and now everything is different. Joanna, please make everything return to how it used to be. And please don't let the other author write too much about spoiled Christina. She doesn't deserve anything."
1,I Hated It !!!,I have read all of the other coments. I also think it was awful. If you think this is the worst book you should read #25 that's the worst book. I really wish Joanna Campbell would come back. I just wrote Joanna.
1,I hated it,"I have every Thoroughbred book, and I love them all, except for this one. I don't know what Allison Estes is doing, but she has ruined the whole Thoroughbred series. Eleven books were focused on Cindy and then, all of a sudden, poof! she disappears. In Cindy's Honor, Christina was still a toddler, not a 12 year old. Why did Samantha move to Ireland, and what happened to Tor. In Samantha's Journey, Tor had proposed to Samantha, and she was also a new trainer at Whitebrook. Why would people want to read about Melanie. And what happened to the Townsends. They would never let Christina sell Legacy, much less let Ashleigh him to her. Why is Wonder so old, and what happened to her foals Pride, Princess, Mr. Wonderful, and Champion. What about Max, Heather, and Honor. My suggestion is that you rewrite #24 and forget about The Horse of Her Dreams. Start off from Honor going to more races with Cindy. Joanna Campbell, Karen Bentley, please, please, please come back.___Mimi Park"
1,Did NOT like it at all,"Thoroughbred is about RACING, not 3 DAY EVENTING. Part of what made Thoroughbred so popular is that it was about racing. And Samantha moved to IRELAND??????? She was my favorite character next to Ashleigh. What about Wonder? It's kinda stupid that she's not gonna foal anymore. And Christina can really be a snot when she want's to. She knew Wonder's Legacy was really important to Ashleigh, since she was Wonder's last foal, but she still wanted Sterling even more. Cindy doesn't seem to be mentioned in this book, either. Ms. Campell, I have a suggestion for you: Give the books that Allison Estes ruined to her, and start writing again from book 14, where you stopped. But whatever you do, PLEASE COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (If you're wondering, I only gave this book a 2 because there was horses in it.)"
4,"Everything ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" Should Have Been","Madonna's ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"" was touted as a dance CD. Well, Jason Walker's ""This Is My Life"" is everything Madonna's CD should have been."
4,Works 90% of the time.,"My nephew really likes the gloves, but they tend to not punch with every throw. The bar that comes with it to ""bend"" is cute and works with the gloves effectively. Great deal at $7.49 for the ""SUPERMAN"" in your family."
2,very disappointed,"Regretfully, there is more wrapping than food and we are really disappointed. From the description, we expected more. The delivery service was the only good thing about it. So, the sellers are good, but we made a wrong choice of the product."
4,Ditch those bulky jewel cases!,This is the greatest way to store CDs... bubble sleeves are removable and pop into CD cases for travel. Organize like a roladex... No more jewel cases with the wrong CD inside! Bring this back! I'm desperate for another one since my first Roladisc is full.
5,Excellent Research Tool!,"I cannot recommend this book enough for anyone considering undergoing this procedure. It is extremely practical and provides a wealth of facts, tips and websites for further research. While you may not be interested in everything offered here, it gives you the option by covering every conceivable detail regarding this procedure: before, during AND after. I have read several books on this subject and--by far--found this book to be the most down-to-earth, readable and practical guide. I am going to send copies to my family members to review, so they will have a better understanding of what I am going to be facing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Touching,"This book is fanaminal! I couldn't put it down! Written in ""Plain English"", simple to read and understand! Author is true to her word! I contacted her, and she is a super lady! I would recommed this book to anyone like mysef, who is waiting for WLS."
2,Only hypes one type of surgery,I was sorely disappointed to find out that this book only talks about the RNY surgery - too bad for someone that wants to have the BDP/DS. Do yourself a favor and look into the DS before you make this very important decision to have WLS. THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAN THE RNY WITH IT'S POUCH AND STOMA!!!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY!,"This item is cheap but it is not a bargain.I just attached it to my ironing board and the arm of the cordholder is so flimsy that it immediately bent over with the weight of the cord. Also, the cord does not slide through the cord holder so you cannot run the iron across the length of the ironing board without it getting caught or having to manually thread the cord through the holder.Poorly designed and poorly made. Do not waste your time or money."
1,Not worth the money,This is really a piece of junk. It broke as I was installing it because it is just plastic that holds the cord. Spend more - get more.
3,Wish it was sturdier,The cordholder does do the job but the screw portion that adjusts the holder to fit on the ironing board is made of plastic and makes me doubtful that it will survive being taken off and on the board. I was looking for a cordholder that had a plug-in feature to extend the reach of the cord but failing that I am using this one.
1,Poor product.,This cordminder could not even hold the cord without bending completely over. Did not work at all! Would NOT recommend.
4,Good but the stem is a little weak,This works just fine to hold the cord for my iron. I notice that the stem tends to lean over a bit (and my cord is not particularly heavy) but it doesn't stop it from working. A stronger stem would be better but perhaps by tightening it more it might help. I like using it.
4,No more tangles,I especially like how when I iron now the cord does not wrinkle what I have just ironed. I would recommend.
3,Acceptable Device,"Bought this as replacement for an old one that broke. This new one has a different joint that allows movement of cord when pulled by the iron, sometimes too much. I don't think this is an improvement. I managed to stiffen the joint by tightening the screw below the ironing board. If that doesn't work, you can also add a plastic wire tie at the joint to prevent it from collapsing."
1,Don't buy,"Do not bother with this product. The wire that is supposed to hold the cord of the iron is so thin, it just bends over. Defeats the whole purpose of keeping the cord off your freshly ironed cloths. The bending of the wire also causes the whole product to bend over and come off the ironing board. The screw on this product is a joke....just terrible! All in all, I would rate this product a zero stars if I could, but I didn't have that option."
1,Don't like,The cord holder does not stay erect. It keeps flopping down. I use my Jiffy Steamer most of the time. Great! Saves me lots of time.
2,Not the same as one we had before.,"We used a Polder 90505 Iron Cordholder for many years before giving it to a relative. This one is NOT the same, even with the same ID & model # (Polder 90505). This one is ""cheap"" in that it will not stay upright with any little pull on the cord. The holder should stay upright and bend with reasonable pull while ironing, but this one just falls over on to the ironing board. Also, the ironing cord ""clip"" at the tip of the holder does not hold the cord - the cord just falls out. I have to use tie-wraps at the base to keep the holder upright and also one at the tip to hold the ironing cord. It is now usable, but a big disappointment.Cost and delivery were good."
4,Indispensable,"And hard to find gadget. An older, different version of this finally fell apart, and I found it impossible to replace in any land-based store -- probably because people don't iron much anymore except when sewing. Although it takes a minute to set up, it is well worth it to be able to keep the cord out of the way of the iron."
3,Didn't Mind my Iron Cord!,"I had great hopes for this iron cord minder since it had all positive reviews, but alas, it wasn't to be so. I do a LOT of sewing and have a heavy duty iron with a thick appliance cord that would not go through the very narrow cordminder opening for the cord. I mean, not even close! And then the weight of my iron cord weighted down the entire cordminder so it bent backwards. This is a lightweight meant for the typical household iron."
3,It's ok,It is fair to say it's cheaply made. The screw is a pain so make sure you like were you put it the first time. Instead of bending it will fold down on you as well. Wish I had the one my Mom had sooooooo many years ago.
1,Almost worthless,Does not attach to just any ironing board ... plastic screw does not hold in place ... I jury-rigged it but keeps falling off
1,JUNK,"Polder 90505-05H Iron CordminderWhen the cord of the iron is placed in the cord slot, the weight of the iron releases the clip lock. DOES NOT WORK!"
5,Handy-dandy,This iron-cord-tender was even better than I expected. It folds down so you can leave it on the ironing board when you put it away. And the clip for holding the cord in place is secure but doesn't crimp the wire dangerously. I like it and would recommend it.
1,Inoperable Piece of Junk,"The cord holder is supposed to rotate 360 degrees, so that you can put it up to use it and put it down to store your ironing board. When the package arrived, the cord holder was positioned to point toward the floor (!) when installed. I could not pull the mechanism out of the locked position to rotate it. I tried installing it on my ironing board to get better leverage, but I still could not pull the mechanism out far enough to free it from the stops that lock it in place. As I was trying, part of the lower cord guide (plastic) attached to the mechanism broke off.Don't buy this!"
2,Not with my board,This doesn't work with my new ironing board but will keep trying. Well built product though. I'd recomend it to everyone else.
2,Doesn't stay on very well,"I got this for the homz 360 ironing board I just purchased from amazon. I love the ironing board, but this iron cordholder not so much.If you can get it to stay on the board it's not so bad, but I don't really recommend it."
1,Polder 30104-05; Poor Quality Garment rack,"Do NOT purchase this garment rack if you are a salesman, or are going to place more than 10 garments on it! It is very cheaply made, and will collapse under the weight. The ad DOES NOT tell you that it is a Kitchen garment rack. Not for use by professional salesmen."
3,Not the Yardbirds You Think You Know,"Sonny Boy Williamson (II) was a blues legend, both as a singer-songwriter and as a blues harp player. The Yardbirds was one of the legendary rock bands that came out of the British blues scene. This album presents the two acts working together, but before the Yardbirds had developed their unique ""rave up"" approach to electric blues, and certainly before they added harpsichords and bongo drums to their act and drove Eric Clapton to quit. There are false starts and stops to some of the tracks, but they show Clapton's developing technique. And, the Yardbirds sound like they genuinely want to play Williamson's brand of blues. As a historical document, this is an important album, but as a stand-alone, this-is-the-only-album-by-these-artists-I'm-going-to-buy set, well... there are better Sonny Boy II albums, and far better Yardbirds albums."
2,Not what I thought I odered,I thought I orderd a DVD of this concert. I checked several times to make sure it said DVD. I have a vinyl of them playing and would like to have a CD. It is not worth the postage to do so.
3,"Good, but still lacking","I thought it was a very good book, had a lot of explanations, from the basics of windows programming to particle systems. However, the version I bought was missing the source code (CD-ROM zip files were blank) which were confusing, and I didn't think enough supporting code was given. A full-length code example for advanced topics such as particle systems would have been much more useful in my opinion, as well as other things like fog (which is mentioned) but was never implemented in any way."
4,Excellent Read!,"I was taking a class on 3D graphics, and we were told to use Java openGL (JoGL) because this school focuses more on java.I bought this book as a fall back for a project I'm doing this coming semester (spring 2011) and I honestly had no intention of using it.Well it turns out that I used this book quite a bit for my JoGL class.I didn't go through the entire thing, but I was able to find chapters that quickly and easily let me display text, add fog to a scene, and most of all get a basic physics 'engine' working.I didn't go through the entire book but what I did go through was extremely helpful, and I wouldn't have done nearly as well without it."
1,Fake !!!,"Well, this book, in it's first part is a simple poor copy of the OpenGL reference manual. The second part is simply copies from what we can get from Nehe and other OpenGL tutorials.It's not said the authors knew what they wrote: they simply always avoid descriptions about 'hard' stuffs.Don't buy it."
3,Oh well...,"This book would be better titled Windows and Opengl Game Programming. If you decide to buy it, glance through the first 2 chapters and if that looks good, buy it."
2,Windoze only,"OpenGL is available on a multitude of platforms.This book is constrained on Microsoft Windowsprogramming. It should at least warn about iton the cover. The book is also about DirectXprogramming. If you program DirectX, you couldas well do the graphics with DirectX.Anyway, the book is comprehensible and easy to understand."
3,"Worth being in your OpenGL library, but buy other books 1st","An average book on OpenGL, covering some of basic aspects of the math and a rehash of the OpenGL API. I am a beginning OpenGL programmer but have some familiarity to graphics in general. This book tends to jump around a lot and can raise more questions than it answers if it's your only resource.If you're just starting your OpenGL collection I would recommend that you buy the ""OpenGL SuperBible"" first and then the ""OpenGL Programmers Guide (Red Book)"" before investing in this one.The SuperBible is really all you need to become an intermediate OpenGL programmer."
4,Best OGL Book !?,"I would simply recommend OpenGL Game Programming. Its a book for beginners yet it covers many important topics like Loading Models,Animating,Game Physics and Maths,Particle Systems and DirectX.But i should warn you that it's authors are not really professional Game Programmers (same guies that run gamedev.net) so u may feel at times that they can't do justice with some topics e.g: Maths. Also 1st Ed. Book's CD doesn't have the source code(get it from book's web site) n DirectX SDK doesn't install.But still its the best OGL book i have read so far!"
4,Very good book!,"When I bought this book I knew C++ pretty well. I new non OpenGL at all. When I was finished I was able to create small games. I was able to create good first person shooters also. This book goes over the math ( real helpfull ), and explains almost everything in detail. I got some signs of the author getting bored at some parts. This is an excellent book if you are good with C++ and want to start programming games. This book gets you started with game programming. You can go out and program a huge excellent game making tons of money after you read this book. But this book is an excellent start... With the addition of a few more advanced books after this I was able to program games at a professional level. This book also shows tips on keeping your games with low frame rates!"
1,Don't buy this book.,"This book is so bad I don't even know where to start...1) not once do the even draw the default axis!2) there's no discussion about performance and what you should do, shouldn't do, nothing, zip, nada3) the code is CRAP. some of it is missing, some of it is broken, all of it is the worst code I've ever seen -- they put implementations in the header files!4) none of the real-world sorts of issues are covered -- multiple textures stuffed into a single file for ""stamping"", texture compression, LOD adjustments, etc.5) it's basically all fluff, if you cropped and cleaned, it would be half as thick and kill half as many trees. it would still be terrible though.Don't buy this. Really."
5,Another FS GD Student recommends it,"I saw another FullSail sudent from three years ago write a 5-star review for this book, and I am updating him. I just learned C++ and I can easily understand this book. I understand the theory, so this book, for $5 was an excellent buy. I need to get the new version Astle was talking about but for now, this is great. Thank you for writing such a clear and concise book."
3,decent - not great but better than anything else I found,"I am a fairly experienced programmer who was looking for a book that would explain the workings of a 3D game engine. Something that would really explain to me what's going on. This book starts to do that but doesn't really go into it too deeply. Most of this book is just an OpenGL tutorial (the OpenGL Red Book is a better reference for that). The last couple of chapters blaze through the development of a simple game engine without doing a whole lot of explaining of what's going on. This leaves the reader to puzzle through a lot of code that could at least have better commenting.My other complaint is that they seemed to be in a big hurry to get this thing to the shelves. It could benefit from some more editing.But, like I said, it's the best thing of it's kind that I could find. The technology changes so fast that older books are kind of obsolete. And with some work, I'm definetly on my way with this book."
4,Very informative and well-thought,"This is an excellent book on OpenGL for the beginning 3D graphics programmer. All of the examples are discussed step-by-step and in clear terminology. As an experienced Java programmer new to C++, I found this book's explaination of setting up windows OGL applications very easy to follow.The last few chapters of the book seem a little rushed, mainly the spotty coverage of Direct Input & DirectX Audio. Then again, this isn't a DirectX book, so it's not a huge deal.All in all I highly reccomend this book to programmers looking to demystify the complex world of real-time 3D graphics."
5,Great Read,"I must say I'm quite pleased with this book.. I was a bit weary because of the high-price, and felt that ""Oh, I've got the OpenGL Red Book and Blue book, this isn't going to be any more information."" I also have read over all of the tutorials at nehe.gamedev.net.... but I gave it a chance.. I always like written work better than tutorials online. I was surprised at how well written the examples were, and how easy they were to understand.I'd definately recommend this book... I hope the Direct3D book in this series is equally well written."
3,Good but error prone,"I had to rework the windows loop on every program to exit correctly. There is also a file missing from the code for chapter 20 (simpengine.h), and a few other mistakes I've found in the code. That said, the book does actually cover quite a bit of OpenGL and is a good beginner book as long as you don't mind debugging the author's code."
2,Cheesy,What a cheesy movie. Made no sense and I got so tired of Brendan Fraser over acting. Sorry guys. Wish it could have been better.
2,Not a Great Movie,"This movie was disappointing to me. I expected better, given the cast. The so-called shocking twist at the end of the movie is something I fully expected to happen--it was pretty obvious to anyone with any imagination. And all in all the story seemed fairly pointless. Yes, we know it's a tough, dog-eat-dog world in sales. Yes, we know competition among manufacturers and vendors is very cut-throat these days. So... the movie's point is what? There really are no ""good guys"" in this--I didn't feel like there was anyone to root for. Just a bunch of people caught up in unsavory situations. The acting was OK, though I felt like all three pivotal characters were not convincing when forced to make an about-face at the end."
5,So how are these reconditioned units?,"Great!I bought this right here. It is very hard to tell from new. With the $25 promo Amazon was running (I had to add another item to get over $150, silly penny) it was cheaper than the fixed base single speed at the local box store. There are several posts about this router as a new item, and everyone knows Porter-Cable's reputation so I do not feel a need to rehash that. But I thought folks might like to see a comment on the reconditioned ones. There is, by the way, a sticker on it saying it was factory reconditioned in Mexico."
4,Serves the Purpose,"This light weight ironing board does the trick for me--I don't do a lot of ironing, but when I do this board does it's job well. I like that it is easy to carry and doesn't wobble at all while ironing.A few very minor down sides: The bars that fit into the notches when opening have to be squeezed in a bit to fit (not much effort required); the padding is very thin and was slightly ripped when it arrived. I have since purchased from Amazon the 'Whitney Design Impressions Ultra Ironing Board Cover and Pad Set' which has made my ironing experience almost a joy.So, for $30.00 plus $13.00 for the pad (no shipping on ironing board, $6.95 for pad), I have a very nice ironing board."
4,PPhillips from WI,"Seems adequate for the job. I wish it was a little heavier, but it works well enough with the new iron."
3,Praying for the Government,"After I had submitted my review of ""AWFUL"", I was contacted by the seller to let me know he was at a conference and had missed my e-mail that I had not received the book ordered. After checking into the matter, he emailed me to say it was shipped first class and that the problem with the delivery was with the post office. He refunded the amount paid for the book and allows me to keep the book if delivered. Because of these extenuating circumstances, I change my review to ""GOOD""."
3,i am very better now,This music is focus on dancing rather than my work in New York. Also for getting back to class. I am go to take class again.
4,"Good, BUT...","My son loved the music from Lilo & Stitch, so I saw this CD and thought ""What a great idea for a Hanukah gift!"" Imagine my shock when I heard the songs start in about the ""son of G-d."" I quickly scanned the liner notes and quite a few of the English songs were pretty heavily Christian. I would have appreciated some sort of warning. The music is cute, and the CD will be regifted to a Christian friend. If you aren't a Christian, or Christian music just leaves you cold, don't bother with this. If, however, you're a faithful Christian who'd like something with a bit of multicultural appeal, go ahead and pick this up."
5,"An amazing video history of social dance from the courts of Italy, France, and England to the ballrooms of America","Dancetime DVD! 500 Years of Social Dance Volume I: 15th-19th Centuries is an amazing video history of social dance from the courts of Italy, France, and England to the ballrooms of America.

An excellent survey of the evolution of an art form, highly recommended for public library collections along with its companion volume ""Dancetime DVD! 500 Years of Social Dance Volume II: The 20th Century""."
3,Plain brown box,"The toy itself is fine, but it comes in a plain brown box. No pictures, no building instructions, nothing to spark a child's interest or excitement, which really stinks since it was a Christmas present for a nephew. I would not have bought it as a Christmas present had I known about the box---presentation matters."
4,packaging not as shown,the toy did not come in the same box that it was shown in on amazon.com and that was a dissapointment since I bougth it to be a chrismasgift. so the packing of the toy I was not happy with.
4,good,"toy came packed in an unlabeled cardboard box. the visual appeal for a child was very low but for the price, the product is quite suitable."
3,"Great book, bad edition","This is a wonderful and rare book. Not to be mistaken with Islamic medicine. What is considered Islamic medicine, is the grand synthesis of the Islamic Prophetic medicine, with Chinese, Indian, Greek and Persian medical knowledge.This book is a compilation of the Prophetic medicine as transmitted by the Beloved Prophet Muhammad (saaw). It treats physical and spiritual ailments.Unfortunately this edition does not have a good English translation, and the print is cheap. The good edition is printed in the US, with a really good sound translation and a learned foreword by Sayyid Hussein Nasr.Enjoy it and use it wisely. May it give you health and increase your faith."
2,fatal flaw,"This book is probably fine if you are seriously planning to learn to speak Turkish, but if you just want a phrase book for your vacation in Turkey it has a fatal flaw - it doesn't have an English/Turkish dictionary! So if you're looking at a menu in Turkish, and want to know what an item is, what do you do? Yes, you can browse through the book looking for the word, but that's hardly convenient. Luckily the tour book I brought did have an English/Turkish dictionary - not a big one, but enough to get by."
1,Mumbo Jumbo,"I bought this book because it was supposed to be a good intro into Alchemy. WRONG!!! I've had exposure to some basic terms and concepts from other books, but this author immediately begins with terms and processes that no beginner will have knowledge of and which the author never explains. It ends up being mumbo jumbo for the first 75% of the book. The rest of the book is in English but the first 75 % is never explained and will still remain incomprehensible. If you're a beginner forget this book."
4,good and informative,this book puts all rumors aside on alchemy. it tells straight up what is real alchemy and what is fake. it is extremely informative and i would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject
3,Finishing the Serrano Trilogy.,"The ""kids"" are on the loose and plowing through deadly politics (only just beginning to realize, how deadly politics can really be). Heris Serrano is 'stuck' in a system with her new yacht, while the chance of a major invasion by the fleets of ""The Hand"" has just exceeded 100%. And Lady Cecelia is slowly coming to the conclusion after her rejuv treatments that the immortality of the ""parents"" might mean the destruction of the children..Cool. Part 3 Although I enjoyed the previous two more, this one seemed disjointed. (The series consists of: Hunting Party, Sporting Chance, and Winning Colors)"
4,Back in the Saddle,"It looks like Heris Serrano will finally be vindicated. After being unjustly cashiered from the fleet, she has served as the yacht captain for a rich lady. Even that has had its share of adventure but she has always pined for the fleet. Now she has a chance to return but that chance is a dangerous one.Her mistress is visiting a planet intent upon buying some horseflesh. While there, Serrano learns of the locals' fears of imminent invasion. She manages to offer some good advice and help them drive off a probe but things fall apart when elements from her own fleet show up and appear to be turncoats. She might be able to save the system from destruction from the real invasion fleet only if she foments a mutiny and takes command of the fleet herself. Needless to say, the turncoats have other ideas.This seems as if it will wind up the Serrano trilogy. That's a shame. It has been a good series thus far."
5,Amazing True Story,"I think more than anything, I long for peace. I hope for a day when all people can resolve their differences with respect for themselves, their detractors, the citizens, the innocent, and governments. I have watched this move several times and each time, I learn something about myself. These men, in one of the worst possible situations that a human could find themselves in, rose above evil and proved that peace is possible. They found their peace within themselves. They realized they could maintain their humanity and spirituality while in this prison, and war. It is an amazing story. I am humbled by their accomplishment."
1,Based on what book?!!,"From the rave reviews of most of the reviewers, it would seem that noone has read the book upon which this film is approximately based. The book was simply used as a point of departure for an all too predictable Hollywood rewrite. It is pathetic when real lives are reduced to plot devices, expedients and screen writing liberties. These men deserved better treatment than this. Try reading the book - skip this farce of a film."
2,Good But Derivative,"It was a good movie but heavily based on films like the Bridge Over the River Kwai and King Rat (among others).The performances were good and the rationale behind motivations solid but this film is not as good as some reviewers are leading you to believe.A good movie, but maybe not one to add to your dvd collection."
1,"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb and Dumber","The movie starts off good, ok, not bad. Starts getting a little bizarre, POW's studying - Plato? A group of POW's start a school behind their captors backs, while another group instead uses their time to find ways to escape. Here is were it gets really, really sappy. The group of prisoners who want to try and escape are portrayed as the ""Bad Guys"" - morons. The other group, the passive group, instead wants to read books and pretend they are going to college. They are portrayed as the ""Smart"" intellectuals, and attempt to use appeasement and not revolt or try to escape from the Enemy (Japanese). The end is pathetic, using visual references to Jesus on the cross and also attempt to show how by being passive appeasers it is possible to win wars.. WRONG!!"
2,"A Sadistic, Messianic Mess","In spite of a good cast and decent technical production values, ""To End All Wars"" seemed an endless torture fest, interlacing brutish sequences of POW camp violence with heavy-handed Christian allegory. On both scores, the film has all the nuance of a sledge hammer, and ultimately feels both over-blown and over-bearing. After viewing ""The Passion,"" then this, I'm prompted to wonder what is it about sadism that gets ""Christian"" film makers so turned on? For a real movie on the POW experience in WWII Japanese war camps, stick with ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" of which ""To End All Wars"" is but an inferior imitation."
5,turn the other cheek vs. eye for an eye,"what made this movie special is it showed three world views: turn the other cheek, an eye for an eye, and cruelty and fear to get things done. it shows how only the first has any lasting impact. some reviewers, unfortunatley, knocked this movie because they say it is too unbelievable. you know what they say, truth is stranger than fiction. had they taking the time to research the movie, they would have discovered every scene is a fact and based in Gordon's book To End All Wars. This movie should be seen by all Christians. it was a better movie, in my opinion, than over-hyped Passion. Shame on all Christian leaders for not recommending this movie, but then again, most Christian leaders preach a health and wealth gospel anyways."
3,Damaged DVD,One side of DVD was scratched.... Could not play movie on that side. We were able to watch the movie but it was frustrating.
5,profound,"This movie far outstrips other movies as to content. This is a true story of men put under very difficult situation and how the seed of spirituality gives rise in adversity. One of the things I found so gripping was the ability of the producer to bring to surface not only the feelings that the pow's were going through but also the struggles their captors were facing particularly when christianity butted up against the bushida code. Well worth the time in watching, not just a ""entertainment"" movie. 5 stars in my book."
5,Memories and patterns,I especially enjoyed memories of the delightful Elm Creek books intermixed with the patterns for the quilts from those books! It was like enjoying the stories all over again.
3,Looks like a color copy - Not the original printed version,"This book seemed to be out of print for awhile, so I was thrilled when I saw you could order it again. I ordered directly from Amazon and I just got it today. The projects are nice, but the book appears to be a print-on-demand version. The pages look like color copies of the original. They have about a 1"" border around the outside of each page and the quality of the pictures is not as high as I expected. I will keep the book, but be aware that you are not ordering one that has the same quality printing as others in this series."
2,"Lovely tenor voice, blah middle of the road material","Denny Doherty contributed some of the best vocals to thr Mamas and the Papas. When that group broke up, he was left without the songs and arrangements of John Philips. He tried this middle of the road material (""You'll never know"" was the one hit on this album). Unfortunately, the rest of the album is a drag - adult contemporary bland material and productions. Sorry I wasted my money on this one."
3,"1974 ,Then There Was No More..","Immaculately produced.. beautifully arranged.. tasteful, reserved strings and horns.. albeit extremely dated. Doherty's vocals carry the day, however. And if you're reading this, then that's what you're after. Right...?! You won't be disappointed. Too bad this guy doesn't lay it down anymore. That voice, man.... there's just something about it."
2,"I know its pretty, and that's where the positive atributes stop.","My friend and I both got one of these and we liked them at first, but this ball is hard, and gets flat very quickly. If you want to get somone a pretty volleyball, a lot of companies make volleyballs in different colors."
3,Not too clear but good source of info,I used this book for my Machines and Mechanisms class my junior year. It isnt very easy to follow and probably could have been written a little better. There is a lot of information in it that we never used. If you need a solutions CD e-mail me @ ohnopk@hotmail.com The solutions are very helpful. Also see my other reviews for more solution CD's.
5,Great book,"This is the single most useful engineering design book I have found. It has a very broad scope of design information. As some of the other reviews have stated, it does not go into much depth in a lot of the subjects, but I have never come across a structural design problem I couldn't solve using this book. As a mechanical engineer, if I could only use one book as a reference, it would be this book."
3,"Review of 17"" MacBook Pro Battery",I've been using the battery since I received it a few weeks ago. I've noticed that the battery does not seem to have the same charge retention of the original. When the my macbook gets close to the end of the charge I usually get a warning to plug-in but for some reason this battery does not alert the computer and it will just shut down into sleep mode with no warning. Again I don't know if it's something with the battery but it's something that the original MacBook Apple battery never did. The Color of the casing is a different color from the MacBook casing itself and because it's on the bottom of the computer I don't really care but it's not the same. The charge indicator on the battery is not as well designed as the original battery. Overall the battery works but you get what you pay for.
1,Poor Battery Life,"The battery only has a two hour life-span. It seems like it takes a long time to charge back up too. I use the computer to surf the internet and listen to itunes music... not a heavy load. Today, it sat idle for 45 minutes and the battery still only held a 2 hour charge. I expected at least 4 hours of battery life so I am returning the battery. Definitely not worth the price."
1,The packaging spoils it all,"The content clearly deserves a 5 stars rating. It has been praised enough elsewhere, so I won't go into detail here.What really annoys me is the unbelievably poor packaging. This has to be the worst since the albums of ""The Sound"" were re-released on Renascent Records a couple of years ago. The outcome is exactly the same: The CDs are already scratched when you pull them out for the first time. I ordered this stuff directly from the label, it was brand new and therefore I am sure that it doesn't make sense to get it replaced. I would just experience the same problem for a second time.So, 5 stars for content minus 4 stars for poor packaging add up to a 1 star rating."
3,"Nice product, but...","WARNING: Be prepared to receive damaged goods. The drying rack deserves 5 stars, the method of shippment deserves -1.It really is a nice product, for something so simple it appears well thought out. Nice design touches, like the many plastic caps which cover any holes.The retail package is clear shrink wrap, which is fine if I was going to pick this up in a store. I was shocked to discover that the shipping method was basically a large plastic bag. Not good protection from all of the boxes and general handling practice of UPS. Needless to say it arrived bent. Amazon, I thought you knew better."
2,"Strong, but rusted chrome rods","I wanted to get a strong chrome drying rack, and after reading a lot of positive reviews about this rack, I finally bought one...But, I am highly disappointed...Even though some of the people who bought this rack gave reviews about getting their rack with rusted rods, I thought Amazon would listen to these comments and do something about it...But, unfortunately, they haven't...I opened the box I received today...and I saw 3 rods with rust on them...I am so highly disappointed with Amazon...I have been buying from Amazon for a long time, but this is the first time, that I feel that Amazon has stopped caring about their customers...I can't even ship it back, because the shipping cost might be more than the price of the rack itself...Looks like, I will have to apply some patchwork or tape to prevent the rust from spoiling the clothes...If anyone from Amazon is reading this, please make sure that you don't send rusted racks anymore..."
3,Rack gets damaged easily in shipping,"This is a nice product, but it appears to be difficult to ship without damage. I returned one and had a second one shipped out - both have had damage due to improper shipping methods leaving the bars of the rack bent and misshapen."
4,Does a pretty good job,This rack does what it is supposed to do - it has a bunch of surfances to hang clothes that need to dry. It also folds up to a reasonably small size when not in use. My only concern is that it is a bit wobbly in the lateral directions. I have only used it a couple of times and it has not fallen over.
5,metal clothes drying rack,"This metal clothes drying rack is terrific. I had a wooden one that lasted almost thirty years. This metal one isn't used all of the time and the garments are usually rather lightweight, so I guess I'll be able to pass this one down to my grandchildren."
4,Useful gadget,"I was looking for a way to take advantage of the summer sun and save energy without digging a permanent hole in my back yard and bought this for hanging small things out on my sunny deck. It works very well, holds a lot of socks and underwear and dish towels and I am very pleased. Two reasons I only gave it four stars: it is more rickety than I expected from other reviews, and mysteriously developed a rust spot even though we've only used it twice. Still I am very glad to have it as it is extremely light, folds up very compactly and holds a lot."
3,Warehouse keeps shipping wrong Item(compact model),"I ordered this product as my wooden Dryer broke. This model is 26 inches wide but when it arrived it looked very small. Then I found out Warehouse shipped a compact model (8316-79) which is 21 inches wide instead of this one. Also compact model sells for $22, 10 dollars cheaper than 8310-05. I returned it and Amazon shipped replacement free. But guess what. Again wrong compact model was shipped. I gave up. I can't go again and again to Post office to return an item. Finally I kept the product at a discounted price just to save another return trip. But still I am paying and keeping the product that I didn't want or ordered. So better get from Walmart."
3,Just one problem problem,"This rack is nice and stable. I like the design, but I ordered a new one and it came with rusty areas on it. I'm not disappointed enough to send it back, however, if you are buying this for appearances be forewarned."
2,Not a very great product,"Though its a very light product and easy to store and fold, but it gets oxidized very soon. My stand got bad within a few months. At some of the places of the stand, it got oxidized pretty bad. I was just using it to hang the wet towels. After an yr, i had to throw this product. This stand might work for a short term but not for a long term."
3,"Good, needs a better latching mechanism","This is a nice, lightweight, strong dryer.It needs a better latch to keep it in the open position. I am using a rubber-band."
5,Lovely item,It looks so much better than the wooden one I have and folds easily. I too have ordered another one but it will take longer to arrive than the first . . . . popularity outstripping supply?
4,Good dryer,My wife likes this drying rack but it is not quite as large as we thought when we ordered it.
4,Light duty energy saver,"This helps me reduce electric use by providing an alternative to using the dryer for smaller items, such as lingerie, dish towels, or other lighter weight items."
2,Ugh! Could Not Get Into This At All!,"I really wanted to like this series and I wish I could say that I liked this book but I just can't get into it which is odd because I really like the TV series.The Chloe in the books is nothing like the one in the TV series, in fact none of the characters are. Maybe if I hadn't watched the TV series first I would have like these books more. As it is, I doubt I will be starting the last book anytime soon."
1,Doesn't fit!!,"I guess it would work for some irons, but I have one of the Rowenta irons, and while I can lay the iron flat on the holder, when I do that the steam continues to come out. The Rowenta iron has rounded edges where I guess it's supposed to fit in the slot on the holder to make it stand partially upright, therefore stopping the steam until you start ironing again. So, it definitely DOES NOT WORK FOR ROWENTA IRONS."
1,Polder Iron Rest,I was not pleased with it because I never was able to receive a complete product. Twice I ended up sending it back because it was missing pieces needed to hold it one the ironing board. If I cannot get a product with all needed pieces then I will not chance ordering again a third time.
1,Takes too much space at the end of the ironing board,"I found this iron rest to be a hindrance for me. I use my ironing board in a small sewing room and this rest just took up too much space at the end of the board. It did hold the iron securely so for someone who doesn't have limited space, it may work ok."
1,not sturdy,The rest will not support the weight of my iron. As it bends so much have been afraid to put a hot iron on it for fear it will fall. Would not purchase again
1,Not great,This was not what I was looking for in an iron rest...it isn't really secure enough...I was really looking for the old fashioned one that the iron slips into and can't possibly fall out of...I wouldn't buy this one again
4,well made,The iron rest did what it was supposed to and holds the iron securely on the end of my ironing board. The only issue I have is my iron doesn't sit at the angle it is supposed to but I don't think it is the holder. I think it is the heel of my iron is rounded and slides up. I can't fault the iron rest.
5,Love It,I have been looking for a long for a iron rest. I was very glad to find one. This iron rest is very nice and I will enjoy it. Hopefully it will help me not drop my iron as much.
1,Hate it,I still have not been able to use this Iron Rest. The plastic bolts do not fit the holes. You need an adjustable wrench to screw in the plastic bolts and it takes a lot of effort to do that.
1,Avoid,"Neither of the screws worked to attach this item to the ironing board. So cheaply made, I would never trust a hot iron to sit securely on it. Returned item. Avoid this one!"
1,JUNK,"If you have a lightweight iron and a handy husband, this might work. Plastic bolts? Oh my. My husband was able to get the bolts to screw in by removing the paint on the edge where they screw in. OK, was happy with that, then I put it on my ironing board. When I sat my iron on it, it flexed downward. I would not trust my iron on this. I will not return it because I don't want to spend any more money on this. In my opinion this is flimsy junk."
3,three tries to get one not defective,PRO: Polder was very cooperative with replacement productsCON: takes some getting used to - kept catching iron cord on holderA quilter's best friend for those who leave ironing board set up.
1,DID NOT LIKE.....SO I RETURNED IT,THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED. MY IRON DID NOT FIT WELL ON IT AND I RETURNED IT FOR CREDIT.
1,Like reading Mad Libs.,"I simply didn't get it. I LOVE fantasy, I'm a huge fan of ""going inside my head to play"" as the main character does in this book. But it was so completely nonsensical that there was no point of reference for understanding. I tried to use my imagination to figure out what could be what, and who could be doing what, where, when, but ultimately it was not worth the effort.This book *might* work for very young children, or as a picture book. It's certainly no Wonderland.I appreciate it's historical significance though."
5,One of the Elite Masterpieces of Literature for Teenagers,"This book, and it's sequel, Haveli, and incredable. Both Books mad me weep and laugh. I had to keep telling myself that it is just a book, and that the characters are not real, but it is so hard. I know these people becasue they are people to me, they're real, and they mean something to me. This book and the sequel inspire such emotions, feelings of compassion, joy, and grief, all magnificently woven together to form the beautiful tapestry of life. Possibly the real life of a real girl in Pakistan. My heart hungers for these books, as they are truly food for the soul."
5,Shabanu is fabulous for teaching about customs in Pakistan.,The customs and culture of rural Pakistan come alive in this book by Suzanne Fisher Staples. Using first person narration made the story immediate and very realistic.
4,Shabanu is a wonderful story portraying an undiscovered life,"Shabanu is a wonderful story, portraying a life unknown by many.Its a book that is requiring of a moderate maturaty level for young adults.Its very intriguing to read about how Shababu had to escape her forced cultural background.Although a little bit slow at certain points, It is very well worth the read,for those both young adults and adults. I have no doubt, in the next few weeksyou will be picking up a copy of Haveli, the sequel."
3,The book was filled with info. and was well written.,Shabanu written by Suzanne Fisher Staples was a interesting look at the life of a Muslim girl entering adolescence. We thought it gave good information on the life of a strict Pakistiani Muslim. The book was however rather dull and lacked action.
3,Our feelings about Shabanu is a confusing book.,"BRYAN FRATES RAMSEY WILSONShabanu is a book about a Pakastani girl who is 11 years old.This book takes place in the Cholistan Desert. Shabanu has an arranged marriage by her father which she does not like at all. We would not recomend this book to other 7th grade student, because of the confusing parts of the book. We would probably recomend it to Freshmens."
2,We thought that the book was slow going and boring.,The book needed more action. It was boring and annoying because of the Arabic words because we had to stop and look in the back of the book. We didn't like it because it needed more action. We didn't like all the talk about the wedding
3,We think this book was a good class reading book.,"This book was fairly written, it had many details about the lifestyle of nomads in Pakistan. Many parts of the story went from very high action to almost nothing happening, this made the book boring. Shabanu would be a good choice for a school book report but not for a fun reading book."
2,We thought that Shabanu was interesting and very appealing,"Shabanu was a well written book, exposing the reader to a different culture. Shabanu, by Suzanne Fisher Staples, featured a Muslim adolescent and her family. It showed the troubles, envy, and jealousy of a young adolescent."
3,This is an informitive book but isn't for action lovers.,Shabanu is an informitive book a book about Pakistan life in the desert. The book is taken from a first person point of veiw by an 11 year old girl named Shabanu. It describes the traditions of Pakistan and the problems that occur while trying to follow them.
2,THE BOOK IS OKAY.......KINDA,"I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE BOOK. BUT,I HAVE TO READ IT BECAUSE ITS THE NOVEL WE'RE READING IN ENGLISH CLASS. I PROBABLY DON'T LIKE THE BOOK BECAUSE ITS NOT MY TYPE!!!!"
5,WONDERFUL BOOK FOR ALL PRE-TEEN GIRLS,"I am 11 just like Shabanu at the beginning of the book. This book was VERY inspiring and explained the troubles in a girl's perspective about ""growing-up"". It has helped me along the way of growing-up myself and will be cherished in my heart forever! GREAT READ! COULDNT PUT IT DOWN~!"
1,Yuck!,I read this book in school. It was absolutely disgusting. I think that Suzanne Fisher Staples wrote a book with innapropriate info in it.
3,Pros and cons of Shabanu,"I just read this book for English class and I think this book is fantastic.This book is about a girl named Shabanu who is dealing with family issues and her own self.The bad thing about the book is that it can be confusing if you don't read it carefully.I would recommend this book who enjoy a sense of mystery and sadness. Like in one of the chapter,Shabanu has to deal about the fact that her favorite camel was sold in a fair. I would not recommend this book for people who want excitement and adventure like in a action movie.So after all i think this book is a fun FANTASTIC book."
3,MISEANA'S REVIEW,"My favorite scene in this book is when Shabanu and her father are going to the Sibi Fair. I like this scene because it shows a lot of Shabanu `s personality and it shows how she feels toward her camel. The literary device that I like and appreciate in Shabanu is how realistic the book is. The book describes actions and things that happen in some teenage lives.For this book I think that the age range should be from 12 years old up. This reason is because the book describes things that teenagers go through and I think that at about 12 years old, most people are mature enough to understand what Shabanu has to go through with the arranged marriages. I would also recommend this book to 12 years olds because most 12 year olds can be able to understand the content of this book. I would recommend this book for people who like to keep on guessing because for me the book starts to get boring after every interesting part. Other than that it's a great read for all!"
3,"Shabanu, Daughter of Wind","Shabanu, daughter of the wind is a book about a 12 year old girl who lives in the Cholistan Desert. My favorite scene of this book is when Shabanu and her father go to the Sibi Fair. Although she has to stay and work during the day, she gets to go out and play at night with her dad. This was my favorite scene because it reminded me of the fair that we have here. I think that this book is appropriate for teenagers and older, because they talk a lot about things that wouldn't be very appropriate for little kids. They would get embarrassed very easily if they had to read this out loud. The author, Suzanne Fisher Staples, uses immagery to make this book come alive. This book was not my first choice, but after i got into it, it was a pretty good book."
1,Not the best,"In my opinion this book was a dicrase to all books. Although it gave points to different kinds of religions,people, and cultures, this book was horrible and boring.This book is about a young girl traveling through different places to prepare for her sisters wedding. Shee goes through different obstacles that makes everything harder and more difficult to overcomplesh. Trying to obey her parents and concentrating on the world in front of her everything turns in to a disater. This is not the best book to read for a child of any age(not trying to insult Ms.Staples). To me in my own opinion I did not enjoy the book at all I do not recommend it and it was very boring. So before you decide to but this book read the good and BAD editorial reviews. I dont give this book any stars I gave one because I had to put at least one to post my review."
2,Shabanu was a well written but not very exciting book.,Shabanu by Suzanne Fisher Staples is about a girl living in the Cholistan Desert in Pakistan. It wasn't what we expected or hoped for in a good book. It contains a lot of personal information about a young girl in the desert but isn't very exciting.
3,We thought this book was O.K.,"Shabanu was a book written by Suzanne Fisher Staples. It was a fairly boring book in our opinion, but it also had many important facts about Pakistan. It had many important facts about the lives of the people, and animals that live in Pakistan. The book discussed how many different ceremonies in the Pakistani's lives happen The book was fairly boring for us,because it seemed to be aimed at the more mature peoples. This book is a excellent resource to learn more about Pakistan."
1,"My God, what an incredibly insipid and uninteresting book.","I am willing to bet anything that not one person who has previously posted here has read this book voluntarily. In fact, I'd wager that 99.9% of the people who have read this book at all have done it as part of some kind of Middle Eastern History unit in 7th grade. This is a freaking textbook, what the heck is it doing masquerading as literature? Whoever wrote it is obviously an anthropologist, a historian maybe, not any kind of writer. Since I, personally, find Middle Eastern culture one of the least interesting ones of all, was it any surprise that I wasn't exactly enthralled by the, ahem, ""chilling cliffhangers"" (Will Shabanu get to find her camel?) found throughout this unexciting novella?"
3,I wish it had been better,"Honestly I began reading this book with high hopes. Unfortunatly Ms. Fisher Staples does nothing with her main character. Shabanu herself is the only interesting part of this book. The story lags, and although the main charaater is likeable, you can't like this book. The plot goes no where, and at the end of this book you find yourself wondering why you spent your precious time reading this pointless mess."
1,This book needs a wind to blow it along...,"I am in the midst of reading ""Shabanu"" for an English summer project and I am throroughly disappointed with this novel. Shabanu, the narrator, is static and one-dimensional; a very boring and very annoying main character for a novel to be based upon. The novel reads very slowly, never going anywhere. I can only wonder why this novel would be given to an Sophomore Level 4 Honors English class to read. One major factor that describes how slow this novel is the fact that the professional review of this novel on amazon.com tells of a story that has yet to happen where I am in the book; that is, more than halfway through ""Shabanu"" and less than 100 pages to the end. I cannot wait for my future English teacher to ask us how we felt about this novel. I already have an answer prepared: ""I learned how not to write a novel."" Don't waste your money, time, or exercise in reaching for ""Shabanu"" off the shelf."
3,good and bad,"This book is accurate as in the culture. Yet this book is quite...PG13 like. It's kinda disgusting and violent. Plus, how did this book get printed?! The author spelled 2 word wrong! The holy book is the Qur'an not Koran. And the prophet is named Muhammad not Mohammad. Someone needs to do the spell check again with a history book."
1,ZZZZZZ,"This book stinks. It's about a 12 year old girl named Shabanu who lives in the desert of Pakistan. Her life as been perfect since she was born, taking care of the camels, climbing thorn trees, and running free in the desert. But when an evil landowner murders the person her older sister Phulan was betrothed to. Now she must sacrifice everything she's dreamed of to save her family. Sounds like a pretty okay plot, right? WRONG! This book tries to make you hate it. It's boring, depressing (her life really sucks), and repetitive. There are some really good parts, but they are just drowned out by the badness of the book. And worst of all, it just ends. The plot actually starts getting thicker, but it just stops. It's like: Shabanu did this, Shabanu did that, Shabanu did thi-The end. The moral of the story: don't read this book."
1,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!,"There are some sick people out there and the author of this book is one of them. Think of the most dirty thing possible and you will find it in this book. I had to read this in my 7th grade class and believe me, it was way over my head. I would be scared to visit the author's house for a minute... because I would probably be bombarded with perverted posters of camels (hint) Read this book and I promise you will have frightening images of camels and weird obsessed girls planted into your brain (hint hint) But if you enjoy mating camels... go ahead and buy it"
1,Shabanu Got On My Nerves,"Okay, I had to read this book for my Freshman English class, for our unit on the Middle East. I had already read the one by an Arabic author, and reading this, you could tell it was by an American. It was a total cliche: Shabanu is an oppressed girl in Pakistan. Shabanu does not like this. Shabanu complains about being oppressed. Shabanu ""rebels"" against oppression. Shabanu is beaten. Shabanu cries.The end.I've met Pakistani girls before, and they're nothing like Shabanu. They're proud to be Muslim- they are proud to follow the rules of their faith.Shabanu, however, is not proud. She never stops whining about it.And then the ending bothered me, too. It was just such an obvious set up for a sequel, it totally disgusted me. It wasn't even much of an ending, really. It's almost like she just chopped the chapter off short and stuck it in the next book."
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE,I've read some bad books in my life but this one takes the trophy. I was unwillingly forced to read this book by my english teacher. I hated this book so much I almost couldn't read it. This book isn't worth the lint in my pocket [price] what a joke. this book seems like it was written by someone that never has fun and doesnt like seeing other people having fun either. this book drives me insane. I am not usually a negative person but reading this book has made me be one on occasion. Nothing good ever happens to Shabanu. Shabanu seems like a good charecter.but they ruined her in the book. If newberry award is for bad books I see why. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think this book StinkS!!!!!!!v
1,Okay,"The early reviewer who mentioned that most of the people who read it were forced to read it for a Middle Eastern unit in 7th Grade. How could this person be so right? (That is exactly the reason I read it.)My entire social studies/english class found it dull, and couldn't wait for it to be over. This is not the usual reaction from my class, as we enjoyed the book we read previously: ""The Cage"". (Why is it that books on 7th grade reading lists are so DEPRESSING?)However, ""Shabanu"" just wasn't good enough! The plot was okay, and the storyline was okay except it was a little slow. The story had a moral, but if you think about it, the real moral is to keep your feelings locked inside you...and isn't that what your parents are always advising you not to do?If you are really interested in the Pakistani culture, read this book. If you want to read a good book, look somewhere else!!"
4,A wonderful book which explains the Pakistani culture,"This book is a wonderful book which explains the Pakistani culture. It is about an eleven year old girl named Shababnu who lives in the desert with her family as nomads. Her sister, Phulan is engaged with a boy. Shabanu is also going to be engaged when she is old enough. But a wealthy landowner ruins the marrage plans of her sister. So now both girls have to marry someone else. Shabanu does not like the boy she is going to marry, but she must uphold the family honor. This book tells about the tragic losses she must face, so now she must make the right choice, to either follow her heart or to uphold the family honor. If you are going to read this book, i suggest you do. It may not be the best book, but it gives you a taste of how hard her nomad life is, and the culture she is brought up in. And be sure to check out the sequel to this book: Haveli"
4,Jillian's review,"Shabanu is the story of a girl named Shabanu and her sister Phulan, who lived in India. Both girls will be promised to marry a man when they are of age whether they like it or not. Shabanu was to marry Murad and Phulan was to marry Hamir, and both were happy. That's the end, right? Wrong! When tragedy strikes, Shabanu is forced to marry a 53 year old man named Rahim-Sahbib, who she does not want to marry. If she refuses to marry him, Nazir Mohammed, Rahim-Sahbib's brother, will make Shabanu and Phulan's lives miserable. Will Shabanu go against her families beliefs and follow her heart, or will she do what she is told? Read it to find out! I liked Shabanu a lot, because it has a great message. Also, I really liked the character of Shabanu, because she was a strong character and I like how she wanted to be herself. I would recommend this book to [...] and up, because of some hard to understand language and inappropriate content."
2,The book was very informative but boring.,Shabanu was a well written book by Suzanne Fisher Staples but it gave more information on the country rather than the story itself. It was very informative but it lacked the excitement that is appealing to young adults. It had one or two exciting chapters but they were all in seperate sections of the book. It gives you a understanding of what life is like as a desert nomad. We think that the book would have been more appealing if it was exciting and more of a story.
2,"Shabanu was a well written book, but it was somewhat boring","Shabanu was a book written by Suzanne Fisher Staples. Shabanu is about a young girl and her family who live in a desert in Pakistan. This is a very relistic book. The author gives great detail and descriptions. One part, in the Sibi Fair chapter, There is a sandstorm and when you read that part, you can really picture Shabanu in a sandstorm. This book was very well written, but boring at times. It was also hard to follow in the begining of the book. If you like good to read well written books with great descriptions than Shabanu is the book for you!"
1,We didn't like this book much.,"We both thought the book was boring and not exciting. We rate this book a 2. There was no action, and if there was we would have liked it more. In all we didn't like the book much."
4,Pakistani desert girl's life struggles,A well written and thought provoking book Shabanu is the story of a young Cholistan desert girl whose family raises camels. Shabanu's story is that of a typical girl in this part of the world. She must endure a very difficult life in which she and her family struggle to survive in the harsh desert and struggle to overcome the corrupt wealthy land owners who control the region. The story is compelling because Shabanu's life is so different from that of 13 year old girls in the Western world. I would recommend this book to those seeking to learn more about life in Pakistan's desert regions and about the Muslim culture. The book examines the treatment of women in this part of the world and makes a subtle comment on the injustice of their situation.
4,Ride the wind,This was a great book. It was one of 3 books that I chose for National Reading Day at my school. The only problem was that I finished all 3 before I got to the classroom! This is a book you cannot put down no matter what. I have only one thing left to say. You go girl!
5,It was great!,That was a great book. It describes what it's like to go through puberty only through a different type of customs. It is not Staples best work but it was very good. I recommend this book to girls only!
5,It was pretty good.,"I liked this book. The plot was slow, yeah, but it didn't go so fast that you had no clue what was happening, which is a good thing. It deserves a lot of credit because it had a realism about it, a person sacrificing herself for her family, which is sad. Read and enjoy.And to all the people who had to read this for school, there are worse books out there. And be happy that your teacher only made you read this stuff, because I have been made to read books that are really bad and confusing."
1,Don't use this book in your classroom!,"What upset me most about this over-generalized sterotypical book was that it is used in classrooms. What are our youth going to think about Pakistani culture? Are they going to think that Shabanu's experience is the norm? Probably, yes! They have no other point of reference. We don't need more books that generalize cultures, especially those that are already misunderstood. Please don't use this book as a teaching tool!"
4,Shabanu,Shabanu Daughter of the Winds is a great book to read. I wasn't interested in it but had to read it for a college class. After reading the first chapter I was hooked. Shabanu tells the story about her life as a young girl in Pakistan. Her family is making plans for her sister's wedding and she is almost at marrige age herself. Shabanu describes the wedding in detail and tells how this is an important custom in their family and heritage. She tells of her everyday life and how she makes it through it the best she can. I really enjoyed this book. After getting started I couldn't put it down. This is a good multi-cultural book for young adults to read and their are so many activites a teacher could do with it. The book is not only informationl but heart touching as well.
2,It moved too slow in some parts,I did not like this book. We had to read it for a 9th grade English class and it moved way too slow for me that I totally lost interest in the first chapter. It was alright in some parts but in others it just seemed to drag on and on forver!
2,Emotionally dramatic and rich character development.,I thought the book needed more action but the author did an excellent job of bringing out the character's personalities. It was interesting to learn about the customs of the Pakistanis in modern times. It was boring at some parts but had some good parts. I thought the ending was creative but I hated it.
4,"Good book, helpful in understanding another culture",This book is about a young girl in the Cholistan Desert of Pakistan. Shabanu was not raised as a normal Pakistani girl. She must begin to act like most Pakistani women now that she is a year away from marriage .This book is appropriate for young people because it sheds light on the customs and beliefs of many of the Pakistani people. It is helpful in trying to understand people from an environment that is different from our own. Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind allows the reader to see how the decisions of Shabanu's parents affect her. The reader can also see the reasons for her parent's decisions.
2,Pretty boring,"This book is ok I guess but it's so boring! I had to read it for Language Arts and I had to force myself to read it because it was so uninteresting. I don't like the way the author wrote it either. It has a few parts that catch your attention a little, but mostly she just talks about the camels and water and making food and planning her sister's wedding. Not very interesting."
2,It's okay,"I'd say that the only problem with Shabanu is that it doesn't get really exciting until the last few chapters. I don't know if reading it in school and having to write about every chapter had an impact on my opinion, but I wouldn't read it again."
1,Brutally boring novel,"I read this novel for school. It is perhaps the most boring novel I have read. I also felt like it insulted Islam in many ways, because it is so surface on so many things. This novel is another reason why adults should not give Newburry Awards, kids should! Please, somebody, write a real book about what it is like to be an Islamic girl!!!"
5,freedom,shabanu is a 13 year old girl who follows her heart and sometimes it gets her into trouble. if you're tired of the disney farie tale ending that couldn't ever happen in real life than i sugest this book
4,Shabanu,"Shabanu Daughter of the Wind is an excellent book. It would be great for high school students or adults to read. The book talks about the culture, society, and family of people in Pakistan. This book gives a good insight into many aspects of life in the Middle East which other people need to know.Shabanu is the main character. She is a young girl who is very headstrong and loyal to her family. She wants things to be different for herself but is loyal to her family and makes due with her life as best she can. Through many trials and hardships she remains strong.Many of the customs of Pakistan are able to be seen in this book. Shabanu and her sister are both to be married to cousins in the family. The preparations for the wedding are described and the festivities as well. This book offers so much more to the reader than just a good reading experience. No one could read this book and not be touched by the plight of women in Pakistan."
1,"Shabanu was a very dull book, there was not alot of action.","I am in 7th grade and I was required to read this book. Most of my friends also thought it was pretty lame. I think it would be a better book if i was a little older so that i could really understand it. My friend hated the book so much, she stopped reading"
2,not a children's book,"I have a feeling this is one of those books that grown-ups would like children to love, but that children themselves won't much appreciate. It's too bad, because it deals in simple language with cultural and gender issues that kids should probably hear about. Unfortunately, the pace and density of the plot are not great enough to sustain the attention of most young people.This is a decent book that has no audience."
2,"it was ok, but a little boring",I had to read this book for my 7th grade reading book. It went really slowly and I thought that it was a little to informative at times. I didn't really like Shabanu's character but i liked Phulan's better. I would deffinitly not recomend this book unless u have to read it.
1,Suzanne Fisher Staples can't write a decent phrase.,"From the start, this book was horrendously unrealistic. The author writes in the present tense, mixing Pakistani vocabulary with English, creating a confusing arrangement without tense or setting. ""It was all the water we could get from the toba, the basin that is our main water supply."" The book is full of such sentences. It is completely unclear as to who the author is speaking to, and who the main character Shabanu is speaking to. Altogether very confusing.This book has literally no plot and terrible writing. The author cannot decide who her audience is. The reading level is for fourth grade girls, yet the content is for adults. I read this book to learn more about Pakistani culture. The extent to which I learned was random information about camels, about as useful as knowing that the plastic tip of a shoelace is called an aglet.Suzanne Fisher Staples needs to think before she writes."
1,WARNING TO PARENTS,"WARNING to parents--please read this book before allowing your child to read it. If it were made into a movie, it would receive a rating of ""R."" There are vivid depictions of breast development (complete with a self-touching/exploration scene), camels mating, thoughts of being with a man while self-touching, a discussion of how to please a man sexually, and a father beating his daughter until she is bloody. The plot turns on an almost- rape, also vividly described. This is being recommended by major Social Studies and Literature curriculum publishers. Fortunately, I read it before my daughter was allowed to read it in her 7th grade class and found it to be inappropriate for her. I suggest you do the same."
5,Masterpiece and Must Have,"I've recently found out this set will be released on DVD on October 9, 2007. I've wanted to order it, but I don't want the VHS. I prefer the DVD. I'm waiting for Amazon's pre-order."
3,A Little Disappointed.,"Even though it's still a really cute coin purse, I was a little disappointed that the frog I received didn't look exactly like the one in the photo. The green is slightly off, making it more like a lime green color. Both frogs have entirely different eyes, the one in the photo look like googly eyes whereas the one I received has iron-on eyes. There also is no chain attached and the body of the frog is a little big wider. Their frog looks more like this frog in the photo:[...]On the brighter side, the quality of it is pretty good and the shipping was very fast."
4,Cute coin purse,"I bought this for my mom since she's really into frogs, not because it's something I think she'll use in her purse but rather as something cute to sit at her desk. The one I received did not have the 'googly' eyes but felt eyes but it's still quite cute. There is a little tag on it's belly that says something in Japanese and there is a small Narato tag on it's rear end. It's a quality item for the price, and the metal clasp is sewn firmly to the frog mouth. Overall quite happy with it!"
4,"Not quite like the picture, but still worth the purchase!","The frog wallet I received doesn't look quite like the one in the picture above. The fabric is a more shocking green (try lime green instead of the nice earthy green displayed) and the eyes, which look as if they are the ""googly eyes"" is actually iron-on transfer material.HOWEVER, it is still worth the purchase! This little guy is so adorable! While his wallet size isn't as big as the actual product, it's still very cute!"
5,Exactly Like the Picture!!!,"After reading some reviews that some people got a ""cheap counterfeit version"" of this frog i was worried about ordering it. However, I changed the default seller and chose the seller ""Animewild"". I am happy to say that the frog looks exactly like the picture, except mine came with no chain and it has iron-on eyes instead of the goggly eyes which I prefer since they look more durable. Everything else looked exactly like the amazon picture. I'll admit it looks twice cuter in person!!! I cannot wait to see the look on my friend's face when i give this Frog to him, he is a huge Naruto Fan!"
4,Cuuuuuute.,"Naruto's frog purse is one of those adorable little details in the series that just about everyone loves. Easy to overlook but oh-so-awesome.I picked up this same purse at an anime convention recently and I adore it. I don't use it much, but it lives in my shoulder bag and occasionally holds small odds and ends I don't want to lose. Currently, my USB card is sitting in his belly.My friends love it, even those who don't recognize what it is from. Worth picking up if you're a fan. He'd make an awesome gift too."
4,"Smaller than expected, cute nonetheless","Expected it to be much bigger. Actually, it's just big enough to hold about 10 coins or so. My 12 year old bro loved it, thou, and is cute! A great gift for kids, regardless of whether they watch Naruto or not. But for collectors, this is pretty good."
4,nice!,i bough two of these.. the first one was perfect this one seems a bit smaller and made of a slightly different material. still.. it's exactly what i was looking for! works nicely too! (and seems to ID me more than my tat.. go figure)
5,I like it,"I gave this soft frog purse to my mom and she liked it, though it does not have much room for coins. :)"
1,Very disappointing and very misleading,"i ordered it because I saw the product picture and it looks fine and it matches my taste. When the package arrived, it was such a disappointment; it doesnt come with the tag and it looks completely different from what I saw. It is rather a fan made coin purse. If you want to buy one that looks like the one with the tag, go to other sites for it. This is a SCAM."
3,Think I got a knockoff,"I think I got a knockoff, because the quality was horrendous. With all of these other positive reviews, I can't imagine I got the same product. The frog was falling apart! Make sure the seller advertises an authentic product with the official Naruto tags"
4,Naruto frog coin purse,This was bought for my girlfriend she liked it. I thought it was a bit small but it holds a good amount of change. Works well for the price.
5,Would like to see more Still Game TV,"This show is hilarious. Became a fan with a visit to Scotland this past summer. While the video is funny, the TV shows are more true to form as they are filmed around typical Glasgow high rises and show much more of the Glasgow scenery. Nevertheless, this video allows Still Game fans to get their ""fix""!"
2,Watch gram weight,"I bought this ring and returned this item, watch the gram weight on items from this seller, they don't describe items other than by weight. This ring is hollow and not true to size. The seller was a little hard to contact, but once I told them I was returning the ring my account was credited quickly."
1,DENTS LIKE IT'S TIN....,This ring dented all the way around within a few days. It is so bad I Don't even wear it. It was a waste of money.
3,Not your typical werewolf book,"I saw this book recommended on a forum and decided to give it a try. Actually, I didn't care much for it. It could've been good, but I felt that the plot was underdeveloped, and that the ending was rushed. I'm a very, VERY big fan of good werewolf novels and have read many....this one just didn't measure up for me."
3,Okay but not a romance,"I got this from the romance section and even though it is basically a love story it is not typical of romance werewolf stories. Or even typical of romances in general. The hero is a beta hero. The writing was a bit pretentious in places. This was obviously written by a man. Examples are (keeping in mind I am talking about ROMANCES written by women not women writers in general) the heroine as a wolf takes a sh**. (His word, not mine). Never do women include this in romance novels as that just isn't romantic. Also the hero smokes pot. Women who read romance novels don't generally think pot heads are very romantic. That's just 2 examples. The hero and heroine spend very little time together and it is glossed over by the author saying basically 'they spend the week together.' The happy ever after bit at the end was barely there. So not a lot of payoff for sticking with it for 376 pages.So a fairly good book. NOT a romance."
4,Best Kept Secret,"This CD is essential to any Underworld fan, and is as good as anything they have done before or since. I would have to say this CD is almost worth buying just for Thing In a Book. 20 minutes of absolute brilliant ambient techno, I think that only Orb could could produce a track of this length and never allow it to get boring. Also included on this, is Dark Train, a great song to dance to if I have ever heard one. The CD ends with Burts, a superb piece of throbbing techno to give your speakers a good work out. You must buy this CD."
5,This is the Real Thing,I have noticed that Christian Art books have been growing in popularity. Many of these are cheap opportunities to jump on a commercial bandwagon in an attempt to make a quick buck. This book is the REAL THING. It is outstanding. The pictures are large and sharp. The articles are informative and written well. This book values its subject and covers a wide spectrum of Christ centered art. I found this book both thoughtful and moving.
4,Quality Antique Brass Knobs,I love these knobs. They were not an exact match to my existing antique brass knobs. But match close enough that I prefer to keep them and wish my original knobs looked so good!!!
5,A Worthwhile Volume...Not Quite Surpassed,"""A Dictionary of Islam"", by Thomas Patrick Hughes (1885), is an exposition of the traditional beliefs of Islam, drawn primarily from the Quran and the Hadith (traditions). Though published over 125 years ago, it remains an invaluable guide for understanding the theology, traditions, and practices which underlie Wahhabism, Salafism, Islamic jihad, and Islamic law (shariah). The work is also available on the web.Many of the articles in the Dictionary are encyclopedic in length. However, they are organized alphabetically, which is not conducive to a methodical study of Islam. The recently published ""Outline of Islam"" (PDF) resolves this problem. It enables users of Hughes' dictionary to research the Muslim faith systematically and topically under numerous categories.Ref.: ""Outline of Islam: An Analytical Index of Key Concepts & Major Articles""(companion to A Dictionary of Islam, by Thomas Patrick Hughes)PDF available at Answering Islam (Index to Islam)"
3,Good-but could be better,"It is a good strong pad and cover. Fits the ironing board well, but does not have straps to keep the sides nice and tight. I bought and used matteras elastic straps to tighten the sides."
1,Not worth it,"Vendetta Red's style isnt anything we havent heard before. The lyrics are the type that seem like they might really mean something, but in the end its just a bunch of jarble. I saw these guys in concert and I thought they were just a bunch of screaming wierdos. Don't ever listen to a band that says a song is about ""having sex in a bathtub full of razorblades."" Its just not worth the money."
5,Subtle and Surreal,"This book, if any, merits more than a single, swift reading. It is a rare gem which should be savored gradually. Each section a slight glimpse of the sublime, Invisible Cities, if you allow it, may prove a valuable lifelong companion."
5,Amazing Book,"I love this book. It has so many profound moments and beautiful prose. It's an easy read and definitely a book you can continue to read over and over again without getting tired of the plot. Each time you read it, you'll find more symbolism and more things to appreciate in Calvino's writing."
5,Poetic Descriptions of Cities are Fantastic,"I have never read a book like Invisible Cities. Each story is 1 - 3 pages in length and describes a different city. However, the descriptions are not so much the physicial characteristics of the cities, but the way the traveler feels upon entering or passing through each city. The book is more like poetry than a usual novel.Calvino's imagination is wonderful. I wish I knew Italian so that I could read this work in its original language."
2,Pretty disappointed.,"If you like needlessly complicated words (he's one of those guys that'll say ""masticate"" instead of ""chew"") and a story without any plot, this book is for you."
2,It's Bad,Gave it a try. Usually I like daring books and brave writers. Unfourently writers who are pretentious bother me greatly.
2,BORING AND REPETITIVE,"i had to read this for school, i hated it. its boring and repetitive. you can read the first 2 or 3 chapters and thats all you need, because it doesnt change. its just the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again and again.. but i guess some people like that sort of thing."
3,for aspiring writers and folks looking for the poetry in the prose,"5 stars for brilliance, 3 stars for enjoyment.The expectation that had been set for me when I added this to my reading list? ""This is the book where the city is the story."" That said, I was expecting more narrative than what I found here. (Call me a traditionalist but I expect a bit of characterization and plot.) As a ""book"", I didn't much care for Invisible Cities -- but I would add it to my bookshelf as a good lesson in how to write about places. There is some pretty potent imagery and interesting wordplay at work in here."
1,Boring,I wonder if I will read to the end of the book. I have found it repetitive and boring. Do not buy it.
2,Terrible,"This book was was incoherent and overrated. It is said that this is a classic, a moving masterpiece but I thought it was no better than a real estate book describing a house's neighborhood."
2,"A cotton-candy confection, not a novel","I didn't like it much, and never finished it. The writing style is pleasant, but without ""real"" characters or a plot, this book is hardly worth your time. Perhaps if you left it in the bathroom? Then all of those vacant little tableaux would be of just the right length..."
4,"Excellent, but not Calvino's best","I had the good fortune to read ""Invisible Cities"" while in Venice and other parts of Northern Italy, where I felt like I was visiting many of the cities described in the book. This book is a tiny little gem collection, with descriptions of each city stretching your brain in a different direction. However, I do feel that some of the chapters are repetitive, particularly on the theme of cities that contain their opposites. For that, I have taken away one star in my review. It reminded me very much of Alan Lightman's book ""Einstein's Dreams"" which I would also recommend (he's no Calvino, but the format and brain-stretching are similar). My favorite Calvino book will forever remain ""If On A Winter's Night A Traveler,"" which if you do not own you should immediately order a dozen copies and pass them out to everyone you know."
5,Best Travellers Companion,"This is the book I give all my friends who love the experience of travel. It is easy to read on subway, between meals on a long flight, and when you simply want a quick story to carry you to the next station. Also, a good book for the reader who thinks they are not a true book reader. I suggest it highly to parents to give their children when heading on a summer trip. Very thoughtful ideas."
5,GREAT!,"This is a wonderful collection of descriptions. Very imaginative. It's good to just sit down and read a few excerpts here and there, but also not bad to read straight through. AWESOME"
4,Small Little Tiny Round Radio for AM Broadcasts,"I found this along time ago. I thought it was cute to buy and give to my girl friend. She uses it for AM radio reception to hear gospel broadcasts. Its a great little radio. It only takes 2 AA batteries. The great thing about this radio I have observed is that she leaves it on all night until the morning and the batteries still work very well. It makes a very good bedtime radio to hear AM broadcasts all night. The FM reception is so-so, it does not do well picking up weak signal stations, but does very well receiving strong signals on the FM band. What the radio does not have is a Auxiliary input to plug in your mp3, cassette, or CD player so you can hear the music coming out of the front board speaker. I hope they bring back the sound ball with a USB socket, mp3 input jack, and digital tuning AM/FM radio. Still this radio is great if you are lucky to find one. It may not connect to your ipod, but it makes a great AM radio."
2,Torani vs Da Vinci,"I read reviews preferring Da Vinci, so I gave it a try. I prefer Torani. Torani has fuller, truer flavor. Da Vinci was very thin and had minimally higher sodium. Can't really justify the price for Da Vinci. Torani was strong enough to provide flavor and go a long way before needing to be restocked. I am sorry I bought three bottles of Da Vinci. But I am certain now, after my taste testing, that no matter what the flavor, Torani has a satisfactory rating with me, and Da Vinci has an unsatisfactory rating."
5,First revival issue of a classic pulp magazine,"This is the first issue of a revival of the classic pulp magazine STRANGE TALES (which was a short-lived rival to Weird Tales in the 1930s). Officially, this is the 8th issue of the magazine -- though the first in nearly 60 years! Editor Robert M. Price (famous for his ""Crypt of Cthulhu"" magazine) has put together a fun fantasy and horror collection, including terrific stories by Richard Lupoff, Darrell Schweitzer, and many more. (My own contribution ain't bad, either!). Good stuff; buy it and enjoy it!"
4,Cute!,"i bought this for my son's girlfriend, who loves pandas. i like the panda facts included, and the tube is durable. i didn't know the world on the top of the tube spins, which is neat. she is 21, but i know she will like this. the variety of figures are detailed and would be very durable for a young child. overall a FUN gift to give."
5,"Little Panda Set, LOVE THEM!","I work carving eggs (Goose, Emu, Ostrich, Chicken) and make Diorama Eggs. These are way cute and very I don't have to worry about one falling and breaking like a porcelain or ceramic figurines. I've made 2 and have given them away already. Everyone who has seen them have complimented me on the finished egg and tell me I could make and sell the eggs (because who doesn't love a Panda, right!?! I will probably be ordering more in the furture. Thank You so much. Great Product!"
1,Poor Lens Quality!!!!!!!,"Length:: 1:31 MinsThis was horrible! This was filmed on a sony HDR-CX110. I am using the 25X optical zoom. I paid $10 for this 2.0x lens and as you can see you get what you pay for. This is some video of the lens in action. Thankfully I am only out $10. lesson learned. You can see in the video that the camera lens (WITHOUT the telephoto lens) is so clear, it picks up the heat waves in the air. The telephoto lens makes everything appear milky. No matter what settng i tried, the results were all the same."
5,Family strength-Hits home to many,"This book is a wonderful story about community efforts to make one child find a better life aside from the issues he faces with his incarcerated mother. Gives a unique sense of dealing with death of loved ones. Very similar connections as in Alice Sebolds ""The Lovely Bones"". Stephen really knows how to draw your interest right away. He draws you into the story. Makes you feel like you are one of the family in the book! Although its fantasy fiction, It could really happen! I really believe it could! I spend a week after reading this book living life in a different light. Waiting for the next Dance to show up! Excellent reading!"
5,Spinoz's Ethics,"Spinoza worked through his ideas using his mathematical background. He diligently recorded his postulates in a very studied order. Remember, he wrote this in the 1600's under trying circumstances.Anyone can pick up the ""Ethics"" today, randomly open the book and find meaning on just about any topic. For example, I'm opening the book now, Page 132, the first thing I read in Italics is:""Only insofar as men live according to the guidance of reason, must they always agree in nature.""At the top of that same page it says, ""Peter has the idea of a thing he loves which is already possessed, whereas Paul has the idea of a thing he loves which is lost. That is why one is affected with joy and the other with sadness, and to that extent they are contrary to one another.""Spinoza teaches us to be moral without religion, but with a total belief in God. His view is that there is nothing that cannot be known. Try it, for this book will end up being well worn by you."
5,Geometric Philosophy,"Spinoza's Ethics is perhaps the first major response to the radical Cartesianism of his period. Although published posthumously (and considered a curiosity by many of Spinoza's closest friends), the Ethics quickly became the center of metaphysical and epistemological attention in Europe. Drawing from a constellation of axioms, Spinoza constructs an elaborate geometrical castle of metaphysical thinking. This beautiful work of inquiry effectively overturns much of Cartesian conceptions of causality and has effectively been canonized as the essential alternative to Kantian epistemology. Spinoza's thinking of substance, attributes, and modes, has remained an indispensable source of joy and bliss for major philosophers. This enticing and difficult text remains a major source of philosophical writing and debate. Curley's translation is still the best in English."
1,Ripoff,This is not the Curley translation - as you would expect from the cover image - but rather the Elwes. Very disappointing.
3,nice pics of Victoria Vetri (Angela Dorian),"I got this issue for one purpose Angela Dorian aka Victoria Vetri and the shots where pretty good, if you buy this issue for pics of Elizabeth Jordan you will be very disappointed only two shots of her breast one small shot and the center fold pic. I dont know why playboy get these women to pose for them and then not put any or very little nude shots in them. I am an celebrity nude hound and I buy a magazine because its suppose to have nude pics of the celebrity I want to c and then get it and no nude shots just a waste of time and money. but like I said I bought this one for Victoria and not Elizabeth. so A good deal for me on this one."
2,Yuck,"Poorly made. I returned it. I replaced it with a Boss FS-6, which works very well, although takes up a little more room."
5,all good,bulbs came fast and undamagednote there is one spare bulb in the lights housingwhat more can I say
2,waste of my money,"I bought this MD to record live concerts and the mic jack has broken 3 times,it's way to fragile. If your not using it for a recorder it works ok. You can only put 80 minutes of music in SP mode, which is not that much."
1,Severely restricted,I bought this MD player to record live music and then transfer back to PC. This CANNOT be done with this player. You can only go from PC to MD.Sony should make this obvious to the consumer when purchasing this product.
1,Sony better learn how to share!,"As usual, great product but horrific user experience. You can copy on but not off, I record a set from a mixer and I can't get it off becuase Sony has to tell me mind my copyright. The software is garbage, and Sony's proprietary crap has gone to far. I'm going to find something that lets me control my own data. Enough is enough."
4,Austrian Economics Mises,"Ludwig von Mises initially taught ""The Austrian School of Economics"" in Austria during the 1930s before having to flee Europe from Adolf Hitler's NAZI movement. Regarding this book, there is the shorter 191-page 1976 edition and a rewritten and much expanded 230-page 1984 edition, hence, I recommend you obtain the latter (or a later paperback edition). As noted on this book's inside dust-jacket: ""This book does not deal with monetary theory...It describes Ludwig von Mises the man, husband, teacher...written by his wife of thirty-five years. [The author] tells about their life in Vienna and Geneva before their escape to the United States."" This book also details their life in Buenos Aires, Mexico City and New York City, and ""also gives us fascinating glimpses of the many major figures whose lives were touched by her husband...[among] them: Otto von Hapsburg, Ayn Rand, Rebecca West, Gottfried Haberler, Henry Hazlitt, Israel Kirzner, Murray Rothbard and Hans Sennholz."""
3,Good read,"A good but flimsy read. Shallow. Good for sure escapism. Good beach book, but it is already the end of summer."
2,"Same song, different verse","Follet is getting rather predictable. Clever and interesting but a ""fill in the blank plot"" - nothing new here.Buy something else."
4,Another action thriller - quick reading,"Another fun, quick, beach-side reading book from Follett- predictable plot yet full of action, scenery and interesting characters."
5,A great Ken Follett novel,"Ever since I read the Eye of the Needle I've been a big fan of Ken Follett.Once You start reading ,You will not be happy until You get to the end.I hope He continues to write for many more years."
5,Very moving if somewhat predictable,"This review is for the unabridged audio version of this book. It's always hard to tell when you've listened with the pleasure of great visual imagery as a wonderful narrator relates a tale how it would play in print. I don't suppose I'll ever know, but I do know it was a helluva good story as related by a gifted reader who does just enough voice change to captivate without annoying. Full of true-to-life courage and emotions with a certain neatness of plot line that does not always ring true with reality. But that is, after all, what a good novel does--resonates with the human spirit if not with the way that actual life unfolds."
5,Another Worthwhile Read,"Another exciting, WWII fiction by Follett............Stays suspenseful throughout and keeps you pulling for good to prevail!"
3,Interesting but long drawn,"This novel, set in early WWII(1941), is about the development of radar by the Nazis. It tells the story of how a handful of Danes (-part of a resistance/espionage movement) work in collaboration with the British war office to thwart the Nazi plan for European (and worldwide) air supremacy. Although I love Ken Follett's style and his previous books (Third twin etc.), I found this book to be a really long read. At over 500 pages, this needs a lot of free time!! Also, unlike his other novels which are usually 'unputdownable', this really needed frequent breaks because the plot is sometimes tedious. I have nearly lost interest a couple of times. (For the record, I love the WWII fiction genre!!) Nevertheless, it's a good read if you can stay with the story (and the 518 page whopper of a book!)"
2,"Slow, Predictable, and Lackluster","This was dull throughout, with the only excitement at all coming at the very end, and even that was very easy to anticipate, and hardly novel. The premise was weak, the plot illogical, and the characters mostly uninteresting. The abrupt character change in Peter Fleming seems to have been designed to ensure that the reader not sympathize with anyone who cooperated at all with the occupying powers; earlier, Fleming had seemed a loyal and charming police officer with a strong sense of duty. I had hoped the book might go beyond the usual stereotypes and examine questions such as whether those British bomber pilots whose lives the hero wanted to save were doing the right thing in fire-bombing German cities. Incinerating women and children from the air might just possibly be viewed as evil, even if carried out by our British allies!"
