2,"Great illustrations, poor instructional technique","This book could have been more in-depth with written description. It is also geared more to the masseuse standing and the receiver sitting. I was looking for a typical massage setting, where the masseuse stands and the receiver is lying on a massage table. Illustrations clear and gave additional instruction."
1,A shortcut to thinking,"As an English professor I am always entertained by malapropisms and mixed metaphors. I enjoy the language and all of its misuses. However, I did not find this book at all entertaining, but rather, bitter, small-minded and for lack of a better word, bitchy. As I tell my students, thoughtful criticism is an art, but bias is a shortcut to thinking. From my examination, bias is all this book comprises. Anyone can tear down; anyone can sneer because they don't approve of a political party, or for that matter, race, religion, orientation, or ""dyslexia"". There is nothing insightful or clever here. Pass on this one."
2,"OK Book-Too many lackluster ""Bushisms""","The beginning and end of this book is pretty good, when he is not explaining Bush's quotes. It gets boring in the middle."
4,He's right--but he fights a little dirty,"I read this book in a couple of sittings and lost some sleep for that reason. It is thoroughly researched and written. Miller makes a compelling case that George W. Bush is semi-literate, ill-prepared for the office, lazy, and more than a little mean-spirited. His thesis that TV & the media are largely responsible for the decline of the American politic is also convincing. I think, however, this would be a better book if Miller wasn't so transparently hostile to Bush and conservatives. Granted, Pres. Bush is the easiest of rhetorical targets, but I think Miller takes some cheap shots and stretches unnecessarily in his analysis of Bush's language. As a result, it will be a little too easy for moderates and conservatives to dismiss this author. But, Miller is to be commended for going beyond the usual catalog of ""Bushisms"" to an attempt to understand what Bush's famed inability to articulate reveals about the man."
5,A book on politics without mudslinging? How refreshing.,"For anyone out there who has started to wonder as of late, if they had somehow entered some sort of bizarre ""Twilight Zone"" dimension, and have somehow been observing a totally different President of the United States, than the majority of the people in the USA seem to see, this then is the book for you.It tells the story of George W. Bush in his own words in a humorous light, that given current world and national situations, is not funny. Not funny at all.Before I read this book, I had heard it dismissed by conservatives as mean spirited mud slinging. Strange how anyone can say that when the author builds his strongest case towards showing the President's true negative character and hypocrital motivations by using Mr. Bush's own words to demonsrate them.If this book is nothing more than mean spirited mud slinging, then I guess Bush must be his own worst enemy."
5,WRITING IN A WHITE HEAT,"The British version of this book carries the teaser ""Be afraid, be very afraid."" And yes, after reading this book, we should be afraid--and not just because the captain at the helm of our ship of state has no business being there. As Miller ably demonstrates, George W. Bush--notwithstanding his powerful family and friends--would never have become President (we cannot say ""elected"") had it not been for the collusion/malfeasance/nonfeasance of our supposed ""free press."" Miller writes powerfully and passionately; the contrast between his words and those of Mr. Bush--so often mangled and incomprehensible--throws into clear relief the horror of our situation. Things are worse than we might have supposed: Mr. Bush isn't stupid, he's defiantly and dangerously ignorant. Everyone who cares about the future of our society should read this book."
4,An Indictment of the Illiterati,"There is not much that one can add to the reviews of this fascinating dissection of Bush's contempt for democracy, education, and (let's face it) reality. The only negative aspect of the book is the tendency of the author to overstate several cases.For example, while discussing GWB's ""rich boy"" upbringing, the author mentions that Bush is a cousin to ""Queen Elizabeth of England"". This is an exaggeration, as Bush is an -eighth- cousin of the Queen of Britian (not England), which is hardly a close relative. Her Majesty has eighth cousins which number in the tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands), as does everyone else."
5,God have mercy on us all,"The title is unfortunate and misleading, leaving readers with the mistaken impression that it's a funny book. It's not. It is a deeply frightening book that uses George W. Bush's own words to expose Bush's vicious, selfish and cowardly nature even as his handlers trumpet his heroism and ""moral clarity"".Congratulations to Mark Crispin Miller for his meticulous research and insight. But woe betide the country that has such a man as its leader."
3,This book explains a lot.,"I read recently about a Houston high school student with a B average who, enrolling at the University of Houston, could not make it through her freshman year because the courses were too difficult. She dropped out and entered a trade school.I also read recently that the two states in the country that have the lowest requirement for proficiency on state tests are Colorado and Texas. To be considered proficient in those states a student need only achieve a reading score in the 13th percentile. That's the bottom thirteen percent.I don't know what happened in Colorado, but I have a pretty good idea about Texas. The state tests in Texas were first administered to Governor Bush and continually dumbed down until the test writers came up with a version the guv was able to pass. That's the one that's used to test Texas students."
1,Only Bush-Haters should bother,"This shrill screed will only appeal to the virulent Left-Wing haters who have come to the fore since the Clinton Impeachment. Another part of their attempts at revenge on the GOP for daring to hold Clinton accountable for his actions, Mr. Miller's book is another weak attempt to argue Bush is shallow and without the capacity for the Presidency. While his Yale BA and Harvard MBA belie the attempts of such professional navel-gazers to denigrate his abilities and education, their vocal, yet myopic world-view plays into his hands. Perhaps they should re-read Hamlet's mad scene."
1,Don't waste you time.,"It does make one cringe on occasion to hear about President Bush's malaproprisms. This book offers little constructive or insightful beyond the obvious. Our President is not a gifted speaker, true, but we will get used to it (we got used to President Clinton's lying), even if it causes us to suffer embarassment from time to time. This book provides small arms ammunition for the anti-Bush crowd, and little more of true substance. The fact is, Bush won, Gore failed to steal the election. Walk it off, and don't waste your time on this book."
2,An Exposition of Personal Hatred,"When I saw this book on the shelf and scanned a few pages, it appeared to be a likable collection of our chief executive's disabilities with the English language. But it doesn't take one long to realize that it is in truth a vicious, vitriolic spewing of the deepest kind of personal hatred of the author toward the Bush family. To have simply documented Bush's gaffes would have been sufficient, but the author insists upon coloring every quotation with inflammatory rhetoric, specifically designed to hurt and offend. If our laws of slander do not cover this kind of pointless animosity, then they fall short of their purpose. If you must read this book, then borrow it or check it out from your library; we do not need to encourage this brand of viciousness by purchasing it."
1,Bad writing for all the right reasons.,"This book is light fare. But, to reject it entirely for focusing on such a narrow topic is unfair. The truth is, these little morsels of strewn thought from Bush, are all that most of us have to judge him on. He has virtually no political background to access primarily because he has no background. To tell me that the man is not who appears, that he's smarter than this, more experienced than this...I'll need to see proof of that to be convinced.As for now we'll have to settle for the suspiciously thin resume of a man and his WORDS."
4,uNpratiotic,"iT' s a politcly motivationed attack on a descent man, precedent and patriot.iF you dont like it here in this god given land then why dont you move to iraq?"
2,A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"This book is a nonpartisan, good-natured, honest comedic romp -- NOT! This book is precisely what it purports not to be. The book tries to give the reader the impression that it is an balanced and realistic potrait of the President and fails miserably.If you enjoy political hatchet jobs and dislike Mr. Bush no matter what he does, then this book is for you.I oozes the type of negativity and hate that most Americans would like to see taken out of our political system."
1,"Smiley, Cheer Up!","Not to worry, President Bush will be re-elected in November and, I'm sure, will continue to tickle you pink with grammatical goofs. Afganistan and Irag are progressing toward democracy and you'll still be able to cash your government entitlements. Saddam Hussein has been captured but you personally are free to bash christians in our country. The U.S. will continue to be the greatest nation on the face of the earth but you'll continue to be free to advocate its takeover by the U.N. All of this should make you happy!"
1,"HEY DEMOCRATS, YOU LOST","Democrats, you lost the 2000 election, get used to it. It was very close, but you lost. It now looks like you are going to lose in 2004 as well. I admit that Bush is very inarticulate, but this may actually be to his advantage. The voters realize that a politician who is inarticulate is by definition incapable of sophistry. Since he cannot beguile by words, his character may more accurately be judged when he speaks. If Bill Clinton were not articulate and slick could he have been elected President by virtue of the character he projects? I think not. He would have been seen as the kind of dishonest wiseguy we have all met so many times. In a time when a President can utter the sentence, ""It depends on what your defintion of is, is."", the American people may prefer a person with a marked inablity to use language."
1,Schpellcheken! Für das Vaterland!,I guess it figures that the only way this guy can take shots at our President is to criticize his lack of English skills. Too bad I'm too lazy to write a book on this author's lack of tact.
1,Horrible--get a clue!,Eliquent speech does NOT make someone a good president. Bill Clinton was a great speaker--but VERY dishonest. I would rather have a President that had character and told the truth than one that can give a great speech full of lies.Ps. I think Bush is learning to be himself on stage and is giving great speeches now.
1,"Eat your hearts out, o ye glib and effete...","Funny how someone so ""dumb"" manages to run rings around the Ivy League princelings, isn't it? And to think your own deathless prose will never see the light of day, while Bush's occasional stumbles will reign immortal. Aw, ain't it just a darn shame..."
5,Very good,Very nice historic revue of the bands history. Lots of earlyfootage of the early years. Good video and sound reproduction A plus
3,Amazing Journey,I was happy to see the old clips on this dvd but was expecting more input from Roger and Pete rather than what looked like one 1 sit down interview.Some of the guest interviewees I thought had no business being there.Overall Id say it was satisfying yet could have been more.
4,a fine counterpoint to Kids are Alright,"A bit different format then Kids are Alright with some new insight into how the band formed and the love/hate relationship between Pete and Roger. Definitely worth getting if your a Who fan. For people just discovering The Who, I probably recommend Kids are Alright DVD for your first exposure into the inner workings of this legendary band."
3,The Who,"I love The Who(minus the early/mod days and the Rock Opera) Legendary Guitarist and Singer and Drummer,Drummer had so much potential.My compliant being a little too long at times and too much romanticism,but it has this great sadness and yet they made it through thick and thin. Phenomenal Story and Good Tribute."
3,1 star for each disc,"I wasn't going to purchase this, but My Wife figured I'd want it. I've been a Who fan since 1979 (the Chicago show on disc 3 was my first ever concert) and I know the band's history as well as anyone. So disc 1, aside from snippets of concert footage that only made me want more, was kind of useless. Disc 2 gets a star for the Railway Hotel footage and for the Moon story as told by Bill Curbishley, although his voice can put you to sleep. What I would have liked to have seen is an interview with Zak Starkey for the Keith Moon segment. Disc 3 gets 2 stars 'cause I was at the show. But I'm taking one star away for what's missing. If you are a newer or lukewarm Who fan looking to learn more about the band this is a good purchase."
3,Could have been better,I have a couple other Cher DVD's - that I love This one has rave reviews.I may have just received a bad copy. 75% of the video was out offocus. Between being out of focus - spot lights hitting camera lensea lot - and seeing nothing but a totally bright screen.....the performanceitself seemed great......its just that most of the performance was a blur.Did anyone else experience this with their DVD ????
1,Awful!,"I bought this because of all the rave reviews and after playing the DVD it makes me wonder if I got a cheaply done bootleg DVD by mistake. All the songs were spliced together from various shows, and not her best performances by a long shot. It looked as though some of the numbers were taped using held video recorder. Sometimes the picture was out of sync with her voice. I could go on and on but to make a long story short SAVE YOUR MONEY."
3,Live in Concert by Cher,Saw her at Ceaser's and loved it. This is about s close to that show as you can get. The sound quality could be better but we enjoy it none the less.
5,"""CHER....so much meaning to one name....""","This Video is absolutely tantalizing. It will take you through a journey of Cher's 35 years as a performer, and she may be in her 50's but she still has the look and energy. I saw her also live in concert in Michigan and it felt so great to hear her bold, riveting voice dancing through my ears. She's the best there ever was or will be and will definitely die a LEGEND!"
1,Total Rip-off,"This DVD is a sham, from the get-go; I am not sure how it was able to be produced and sold, as it comes-off as a pirated issue. The good reviews listed here, obviously are not for this Hudson Street version. (1)the picture on the cover is a poor copy/scan of a 1979ish picture of Cher; (2)it contains song clips from HBO's 1999 ""Live in Concert"" and Image's 2003 ""Farewell Tour""; (3) the editing is terrible, as the song clips are not arranged in the proper order (Cher does not change BACK INTO a costume)and the clips from the 2 concerts are mixed-up; (4)before each clip a VERY cheap looking graphic comes-up and gives the song title - they should have just had someone hold up a sign with the song title; (5)the box states it was filmed entirely in Las Vegas, but one of the concerts was filmed in Miami; (6)the video quality is very poor, and blurry...almost as if someone held a video camera at their TV and taped it. Please order the originals...not this scam."
2,Disappointed,"I thought it was a big disappointment. My mom was even very disappointed and she loves Cher as long as I can remember. The dancers seemed way out of place. They seemed like they were doing their own show, had nothing to do with Cher. I also thought she took way to long to change her clothes, which most were horrible. Then you were stuck watching these dancers. During one changing they had clips of her movies on a big screen which I also found stupid. You go to a concert to hear her music not see clips of her movies. I could go on but I'll just say I thought it was a terrible show. I give her credit to still go out there at her age, but I think she should hang it up now and go out gracefully. I suggest to all Cher fans to rent this video first and then decide if you really want to buy it."
4,Seen it live!,"I saw this concert live! I am not a big Cher fan, but hey... she can rock, disco, and bop all over the euro tracks! I am 27 and only have only seen a fraction of all that Cher has accomplished. Her song ""Believe"" also marks a begining of a new era in my life. It will always carry a special memory with me. Fan or not... I love it!"
1,"low production value, bits and pieces of concert","low budgeted video of concert, and it was all broken up in pieces instead of the show from begining to end. Disappointing."
4,great DVD,"I enjoied this DVD quite a lot. There is not much to say about the DVD, but the concert is what a Cher fan espects."
5,Cher Rocks !,"This is without a doubt the most amazing Cher concert ever filmed ! She goes through her fashionable closet about as much as she does her extraordinary catalogue of songs,many of which she has never performed Live in concert ! Definetly worth a buy if you didnt catch the Diva on her ""Do You Believe "" Tour . I saw her live and have got to say seeing this video gives the audience the feeling of being Right there at the show !"
4,Cher is #1 in L.V.,"This show is so good that it would have been a blast in 5:1. Oh well, maybe someday. Enjoy!"
3,Cher in Live in Vegas,I have been a Cher fan since the Sonny and Cher tv show days. I have two other dvd's of Cher live one at the Mirage and one at M.G.M. and they are both truly entertaining to watch . I was kinda sorta disappointed in this Cher Vegas video not because of Cher or her songs but the way it was put together. I mean first off you have no idea of where she was appearing in Vegas and also this video was not really a clear copy. I have no idea irf it was a copy of the original but it is NOT worth the price in my opinion. It is okay it it is your first Cher video but to a true Cher fan it was not an A grade video maybe a C + or a B - .Dennis in Ky
2,Somewhat dis-appointing,"I purchased this DVD as I missed Cher's concert while she visited Ireland and although the quality of the DVD itself is top class in both sound and vision I was somewhat dis-appointed with the show itself. Firstly I felt like I had seen the show before as Cher blatantly steals elements of her concert from Gloria Estefan and Janet Jackson therefore if you've seen these shows you're left you with no surprises and a sense that little thought was put into it from the woman herself. Certain songs such as from her latest album ""Believe"" are performed very well, in particular ""All or Nothing"" and ""Believe"" but parts of it left me wanting...I think Cher has some great songs out there but only a few were selected for this tour and the rest are among her weakest. I should have listened to my friends when they told me they were disappointed with it also! I recommend this DVD only to dedicated, die hard fans."
2,Cher Live,"This concert is fantastic in the sound cat. Only problem is, Cher uses the F... word and takes the Lord's name in vain. If you want that type of entertainment in your home, you may enjoy the concert. I don't know what Cher was thinking to include such vulgar expressions in an otherwise stellar concert. This DVD was not rated, so you would not know it was in the DVD without this review until you watched it. This is not something I want in my home. Cher should learn from this, vulgarity is crude, rude, and very low class. Disappointed in an otherwise classy lady."
1,There must be some mistake.,"I am a fan of Julia Cameron's ""The Artist's Way"" and think it to be one of the most valuable references an artist or writer can own. There are times when the spirit needs to explore what is ailing. After reading reviews I was ready to be entertained and further enlightened by this book. My gosh, after looking through it I couldn't help but think there'd been a mistake. This didn't seem like it came from the same author. While I can go for sophomoric humor as well as the next person, this was all that and less. I hope Julia will take this one back to the drawing board and come out with a whole new and improved version. The cartoons are kind of weird and the captions are flat. Was there anything to take away from this? Yes. I just wasted the cost of a book that might be worth keeping.. Maybe this one will find it's audience at the Goodwill store."
3,This is a really good action movie.,This is a really good action movie that will keep you totally entertained.
2,FASTFORWARDITIS,"This is a horribly unentertaining movie. I have seen other Nico Mastorakis' movies, such as Zero Boys and Bloodstone which are B-movies but entertaining. I'm not going to cut him any slack with the old cliche, this is so bad it's good. This movie is the nightmare and the DVD is overpriced on Amazon.There are a bunch of extras: trailers, DVD specs, Nico Mastorakis' ongoing documentary, and a filmopgraphy. The DVD is widescreen and the actual image and sound quality is good."
5,Spectacular!,This album defies words. Unbelievable. The drumming exists in another solar system entirely! For any serious fan of modern avant garde jazz.....this album is a must-own.
5,most amazing album ever made,"this album is brilliant, but it's basically because of the drumming. jason wildman is the most amazing drummer in the world, and anyone interested in jazz drumming should listen and learn from him. long live the wildman!!!"
4,good,Its a great book for those that have never ever learned about how to escape domestic violence. all in all its a ok book for a person who suffers from any kind of domestic violence
3,Pretty!,"Really pretty ring--beautiful color. Mine did arrive with a tiny chip on the corner of the stone....was pretty inexpensive though, so I don't think I'll bother sending it back. One con is that the two exposed points of the stone are rather sharp...you could really hurt yourself/someone is you accidentally scratched them. Overall I am quite pleased with my purchase--4 stars.EDIT: Two weeks later--have chipped off both pointy tips just wearing normally and given myself quite a nasty scratch as well. Still think it's really pretty, but maybe best for just occasional wear. Downgrading to 3 stars."
3,Inner lining flakes,"This rice cooker is very pretty and compact. It cooks rice well and has a nonstick lining. The manufacturer gives instructions on how to take care of the nonstick lining and we followed it. During normal use though, as the rice cooker boils for multiple periods of time, the lining also bubbles and permanent bumps develop at the bottom of the bowl. Then the lining flakes off. The manufacturer doesn't comment on this fact and just offers to sell you another replacement bowl for $10. We have had this rice cooker for around 2 years."
1,High chance of failure,"This rice cooker was purchased locally for $20. After its first use, which managed to make semi-decent rice, it no longer worked and died completely. I'm afraid that the manufacturing quality of these rice cookers seem to be abysmal. Please for your own sake, do not buy this rice cooker."
4,my first of Dorien Grey,"*The Butcher's Son* is my first read of anything that's penned by Dorien Grey. I found it to be a good read.Dick Hardesty is going through a gradual break-up from his boyfriend. The break-up is made a reality when the boyfriend gets offered a new job far away.Meanwhile, there's a series of arsons against the gay bars in town, eventually resulting in deaths. In the midst of his investigation, Dick encounters twins (one's gay and the other's allegedly disappeared), the homophobic police chief and drag queens.If you liked Michael Nava's Henry Rios series, then you should like Grey's Dick Hardesty series."
4,Radius DVD-R Media,I ordered 100 of these and after using over half of them have not had one bad disc yet so I ordered 300 more. I am sure there is better media to be had but not for $.30 delivered to your house and printable. My only complaint is that the media is not hub printable.
2,"Cheap, unreliable.","Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
1,Buy it from a department store,The La Mer Concentrate is great... but it doesn't cost anywhere near this much. Even Neimans sells it for less.
3,Very Entertaining,"I found this book very entertaining. Liked how the authors mixed their ""golf tour"" with real golf info and places. Kept me entertained until the very end when the killer was revealed."
3,Rotten Lies,Soso. I found it slow and a little boring. Aaron Elkins' books are normally more enjoyable that this one.
5,A great debut novel,"Finding first novels such as this one always makes my day. This guy can write, and he is certain to have a very successful career if this is any indication of his talent. No this novel is not perfect (others have mentioned the typos), but I'm not going to find fault with what should be the editor's job. Our narrator Teddy, is a 12 year old boy whose life is thrown sideways when shortly after the death of his mother, his oddball history professor father wins it big in the lottery. The cast of characters is poignant and hilarious. Teddy is a perfect narrator, still seeing the world with the remnants of childhood innocence, but begininng to uncover the harsher realities of life. This novel does not disappoint, I would highly recommend it."
5,"A great, funny read",I thoroughly enjoyed this author's first novel. The characters were richly written and hilarious. I will read this author's next book.
3,Did this book have a copy editor?,"Did this book have a copy editor? The author repeatedly demonstrates that he doesn't understand the difference between ""lie"" and lay."" He uses ""I"" where he should use ""me,"" ""he"" where he should use ""him,"" and ""who"" where he should use ""whom."" He uses ""passed"" where he means ""past"" (as in ""She walked passed our table"") and ""route"" where he means ""rout"" (as in ""The battle turned into a route""). To top it off, at one point he actually says that a character allowed ""sufficient enough"" time to do something! (As opposed to ""insufficient enough""?) The story is original and the characters are engaging, but it's difficult to focus on them when you're wondering where the next grammar or usage error will pop up. St. Martin's has found a promising new author; it's too bad they couldn't have done him a favor and cleaned up his sloppy mistakes, instead of allowing them to appear in print."
5,"Funny, Sad, Real....",The author creates humor in a sad situation. It's one of the best books I've read so far. The characters are very real and true to life. Great book...
2,"fine, but poorly made","have been having migraines and was recommended to get a good neck pillow. this thing is *fine* but not very adjustable in terms of exactly where under your neck/head it should fit, and...it's very poorly made. so-so fabric and stuffing, and one of the main seams just totally popped open the second day. it's a good thing i'm handy at sewing or my pillow would have been useless after that."
2,Dogbone pillow too large,When I placed my order for this pillow I was apprehensive. I really needed a description which included the measurement around the narrow part - I should have followed my instincts - now I will have to give it to someone else. I missed Walgreen's short term special featuring a slim version of your too fat pillow.
3,Stick with U-shaped travel pillow,I purchased this pillow to help with sleeping on an airplane or car but ended up using it while lying on the sofa. The result was quickly neck pain and the pillow got moved to the car where it does provide little additional comfort. The best thing is that it can be fixed to the head rest permanently. If I were to buy another pillow it would not be the dogbone kind rather the old fashioned U-shaped travel pillow.
4,Overall very good,Bought this for a flight but it ended up being too bulky to use behind my petite neck in the seat. It then became an arm rest on my lap. I love using this at home in bed while propping myself to watch tv. Bought one for the Mister. Love that i can toss it in the washer and dryer. The hawaiian print faded somewhat but it doesn't bother me.
4,Very comfortable,"I got this recently and the pillow is very comfortable. I got it mainly for air travel but find myself using it on the sofa too. Mine appears to be of quite good quality, I do not worry about it tearing for a while. There is a zipper to open the cover and inside it is stuffed with some kind of soft fiber. The only downside I see is that I think this will be hard to wash because the stuffing might be hard to put back together on my own."
5,Doctor recommended,"My 15 year old daughter requested I order this product. She has been going to an Upper Cervical Chiropractor for about two months now and he suggested this product to help maintain her adjustments. She sleeps on it nightly and rests periodically throughout the day, when at home. She wanted a product that wasn't too ""grandma"" looking and this fabric fit her style. The price was better than those offered at the doctor's office, so I couldn't say no! While I haven't had to wash/clean it, it appears simple enough with a zipper closure. Amazon is where we go first when considering any purchase!"
1,Broken zipper,"My girlfriend said "" oh wow, look a zipper so we can refill the stuffing if we need to "" She opened it and never got it closed again. The zipper malfunctioned. It was not caught on any material whatsoever. It broke. Not cool. She just sewed it up. So much for replacing the stuffing. Also, she woke up with a blue neck. The dye comes off this thing so badly. Hope it's not too poisonous."
4,Very Comfortable!,"I am so glad I bought this pillow before my 8 hour flight! Not only is it comfortable, but it can be used for your head, lower back or legs. It does take up more space that an inflatable (obviously), but the comfort level is worth it."
2,Not great for driving,"I have chronic neck pain which is worse with driving. Currently I am using a U-shaped type pillow which helps somewhat with my neck pain. This DogBones Neck Pillow actually made my neck pain worse. It might help if you're a passenger, but it did not help while I was driving. I'm still looking for a better neck pillow..."
4,Awesome!,I've been looking for dog bone pillows for a while now and found them on Amazon.com. I purchased two of them and use it when watching tv and for sleeping. They're very comfortable and supports my neck well.
3,"Good book, but outdated","If I were back in 1980 when this book was originally published, I'd probably give it 5 stars. It's well written, with clear derivations and every topic I read has an appropriate balance of mathematics and intuition. I also appreciate the author's care in distinguishing practical from theoretical ideas.However, in many aspects this book has been superseded by newer texts. If you want a detailed exposition of array processing, I recommend Van Trees'Optimum Array Processing (Detection, Estimation, and Modulation Theory, Part IV). It's above everything else on clarity and depth. If you only want an introductory textbook, then consider Johnson and Dudgeon'sArray Signal Processing: Concepts and Techniques."
1,Unreadable controversy for its own sake,"The Preface makes it clear that the thesis -- and subtitle -- were chosen primarily for the sake of making a splash, not for necessarily being accurate. I have no idea whether the author made much of a case, since I discovered in the first few dozen pages, and then some selected sections following, that the book is abominably badly written, gives appallingly little actual information on the two major events of 1676 (leaving out huge amounts of information found in books where King Philip's War and Bacon's Rebellion are only part of the subject matter), and ends with a really bad index."
3,"The Wrenches Fit, But the Ratchet Broke","These seat wrenches solved the problem, and I was grateful for finding them online at a very affordable price. Unfortunately, the ratchet wrench broke on first usage. It is mostly plastic, and it just couldn't take the torque required to break the seat loose from the valve body. It probably should have been an open end wrench which can handle large torques, and without moving parts."
3,"Great wrench, rubbish ratchet.","The ratchet provided in this set is rubbish, the gear pawl sheared the first time it was used, however the actual straight wrenches are excellent quality."
5,Teachers with attitude,I have learned more about the world from this show and these two magician/comedians than from any of my teachers.
2,Doubt they'd have made this show in 2012,"A major pontification from 2007 about how safe nuclear energy is. I wonder what they'd say post Fukushima. The US has plants subject to similar catastrophes. That kind of flies in the face of a lot of their analysis in this episode. In fact, seeing this post Fukushima makes them look pretty ridiculous. They'd probably find some rationalization to rebut this, by interviewing the right industry spokesperson who will say Fukushima is exaggerated. Their general approach is to find somebody with credentials who agrees with them somebody without credentials who doesn't, and then to call the latter person an obscene name. Hilarious when they're right, and they often are, but shameful when they're dead wrong, as is the case in this episode."
5,mwana wa ndigwa,"ienjoyed this cd so much because it amixture of 3 different dialects spoken in Kenya and basically with the same theme. Iam a Kikuyu so my favourites were (mwana wa ndigwa and Ururu mwana) The rhythm and beat is great. It reminds me of old good days back home. i would recomend it to anyone. my next order is Maitu Maitu cant wait to play it. The Luos, the Wakambas great job."
3,Good overview for beginners,"This book gives a very good review for beginners investing in the US bond market only. If you are a professional it is more a dictionnary, it doesn't analyse properly instruments. I would like to finally see an author able to understand that a bond is a bond, and a book like that should focus on this and not to give us a extensive listing of all US bonds in the market ....Second USA are not anymore the only financial market in the world : so ""International"" chapter should be at least as important as the rest of the exercise..."
1,Better be gold-plated!,"I have no doubt this adapter works just fine. But really, $50? Shop around a bit and you will find a regulated 5V 1A supply delivered for about $20. If it doesn't have the right connector, go to the Shack and pick up Type B, 4mm OD by 1.7mm ID for an extra $3."
3,An ac adaptor that should come with the canupos product,The item works fineBut i find a steal from the canopus manufacturer not to provide it with the product!
5,Works as designed although very pricey,As far as an overall rating based on the product performance this item gets a full 5 stars from me as it works perfectly as designed. The only downside is that it is very expensive for something that really should be included with your Canopus converter to begin with. So as long as you can get over paying a pretty steep price for a very basic item you will be satisfied.
3,Shouldn't have to pay (especially so much) for this,"$39 for a power cord...are you kidding?I was in a jam, against a deadline, couldn't tell from the Canopus description if I would need this or not (I was going to use Firewire, some reported power coming from Firewire and others none)...so I bought this along with the Canopus boxes. Turned out power *did* come from the Firewire ports, so I didn't need this.Kept it anyhow, in case of a problem in the future.$39..really? It should be in a less fancy box and cost $19 or less. Just my take."
3,Good movie,"Good movie but the only reason I gave it three stars is because it skips a lot, other than that, no complaints."
5,Must Have!,This film is definitely a must have. Such a charming movie that most people have never heard of! You not only sympathize with Reese but with the rest of the characters as well. Well done!
1,The Man in the Moon,"I am very disappointed!! I love this movie & when I received it, the disk said it wasn't available in this region. I have tried it on several DVD players & still NOTHING!!!"
5,Chirping crickets have never sounded more beautiful!,"Everyone told me how great this movie is, but I didn't listen. Ten years after its release, I have FINALLY watched this movie. I must admit, I should have listened to my friends and jumped on the bandwagon long ago. This is a masterpiece--one of the best coming-of-age dramas I've ever seen! This movie explores many issues--first love, sister rivalry, tragedy, and redemption. You'll feel the summer heat as Dani (Witherspoon) rushes home from church to change into her bathing suit. The scenes in the pond are beautiful! The sound of the outdoors delights the senses and adds to this breathtaking cinematography. The cast, the setting, and the story all come together to make a PERFECT movie. I can't wait to add this one to my collection!"
5,A charming story,"This is a fantastic movie centering on the trial and tribualtions of two families in the rural south of the USA.It centers around Dani ( charmingly portrayed by Reese Witherspoon) a pretty , headstrong (yet vulnerable)and wonderful 14 year old girl , and her love for Court (played by Jason London) . Unfortunately everything does not go according to plan , especially when and Dani's older sister ,Maureen , and Court elope .The innocence is later exposed to an even bigger shock by a terrible tragedy.This movie portrays the clash between innocence and experience and has some really delightful characters. It is a must see as a film in the 1990's set in the early 1960's , showing a simpler , purer time."
1,Wrong Bar Code!!!,I love this movie and so does my daughterbut when we got our movie it had the wrong bar code.I threw the package away that it cae in so I guess that some money out the window.
1,Not for use on a laptop,"Apparantly, this is a copy of a copy, and it cannot be played on a laptop, so why did the information not state this exception, yes it works on a DVD player, but this copy was bought be viewed while flying. I feel that this supplier has mis-reprensented the product, and in the future, Amazon's suppliers are questionable."
3,The Moon goes over the Top,"Sam Waterston is wonderful, and Reese Witherspoon foreshadows her later brilliant film career. The best scene in the film is one between the two of them, when she apologizes to him for his ""taking the strap"" to her and he, her father, comes around to the other side of the car and takes her in his arms even though he cannot make eye contact. Wow -- only an iceberg would not have a tissue in hand here.Unfortunately, the film milks the melodrama a little too vigorously. The first half is interesting, restrained if sentimental, but it raises serious questions about the loyalty to family in the arena of passion. In the second half, the film-makers simply pull out all the stops and to a fault. I don't want to spoil the plot, but let me just say that the final scene -- which ""unites"" two estranged characters prone over a grave -- is simply too much.The film has potential, but gives it over to emotionalism. Hey, even we chicks have our standards!Still, worth renting."
3,"Not bad, not great","After I read all these wonderful reviews, I decided that I should go rent this movie. Well, I can't say that I agree with all the good reviews. This movie took a really long time to take off, and not much happened during the coarse of the film. The movie us about a 14 year old girl named Dani (Reese Witherspoon), who is starting to discover boys. Soon, she falls inlove with a boy 3 years older than her, Cort (Jason London). However, Cort is much more interested in Dani's older sister than he is in Dani, which causes real drama later on. I guess I would reccomend this film to any Witherspoon fan because it is her first movie, but I wouldn't reccomend to most guys because it is really a chickflick. I'm a guy, and I found it pretty girly. Maybe it is worth seeing once, but no more than that."
3,the man in the moon order,the dvd was was in good condition.how ever the case was in very bad condition but i didn't need the case anyway so no big deal overall very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Great Love Story,"This movie is a great love story (love triangle). Most guys would call this movie a chick flick. It has great stars in it such as Reese Witherspoon, Sam Waterson, Jason London, and Tess Harper. This movie is a real tear jerker! A must see!!!"
5,Wonderfully touching and sweet,"I love this movie. Reese Witherspoon is young but does an amazing job of showing how young love develops and what happens when it is lossed. Be prepard with some tissues, because undoubtely your heart will cry for these characters.I reccomend this movie highly."
5,Carrie,"I love this movie so much, my sister and I watch it all time. I think it is a tear quincher movie, no matter how many times I watch it, I still try not to cry. I believe that this movie was the best movie ever."
4,Light Hearted Drama....,"This film is rich in Southern charm, young lovers' woos, and the bitter sweet facts of life. Written by Jenny Wingfield, this film tells the simple, heart warming story of her childhood. Far from a blockbuster filled with idealistic violence, this movie keeps your attention with lovely family ties and trials. A must see for any family...a perfect pure and clean film."
4,"Brittany Donabaur, 13 1/2, a fan of the movie.","I truly love this movie. When I first saw it I thought it would be so boring, but it wasn't. It was sad and interesting to watch. I really want to buy this movie. I love Reese Witherspoon she is an awesome actress in this movie. If I were to give her a score from 1-10, I would give her a 10 for doing so well. Good job Reese!"
1,CRAP,"I rate this item one star, but only because there is no -5 on this. The item shown on here is not even close to what you receive, you do not get a scoop like shown. All you get is a tube with an opening at the bottom, you can go to autozone and make one yourself for $20; instead it costs over $130."
4,A great documentary on alternate (medical) therapy.,"A well researched documentary, with a great insight into cancer treatment.This should be viewed by anyone considering traditional cancer treatment, with an open mind,or anyone just looking for more information.Get to know it before the ""dying "" part kicks in."
3,"its ok, but lacking information or how to","good background on the diet correcting cancer, but never gets to the how to's of the Gerson diet. Buyers remorse, maybe.... but I didn't gain anything."
3,NO to Gerson Therapy,"I am a vegan of 8 years and I am AGAINST the Gerson therapy!Daily regimen for Gerson Therapy:NO water intake, zero13 fruit juices dailyNO avacado, berries, cucumbersDaily injections of VEAL LIVER extractDaily enemas of coffeeDaily injections of thyroid hormonesThe proven cause of most cancers is from animal intake, so why do they want you to take VEAL calf liver injections!The SOLUTION is to just go completely vegan. Read books like The China Study for proof"
1,Absolute Tripe,"This infomercial masquerading as a documentary gets 1 star for proving, beyond a shred of a doubt, that Netflix has some tweaking to do on their viewer rating prediction algorithm.Why else would it predict a 3-star rating for this film? There has never been, nor will there ever be, even a micron of evidence supporting Gerson. The treatment simply doesn't work. Not only that, it is dangerous--coffee enemas are potentially lethal, as are the low sodium levels induced by this quack diet.[...]"
5,A great true healer,"Dr. Gerson was ahead of his time. Now basic research is discovering more and more of the reasons why his therapy would work. William Li and Dean Ornish had TED videos worth watching. Dr. Li shows the potent anti-angiogenesis properties of many plants. Dr. Ornish shows the quick genetic changes after a change in diet. There is more to be discovered, but there is no doubt that Max Gerson was a great true healer."
3,Disappointing,"Anyone who has never seen the Spencer Tracy/Fredric March version of this classic play (based on the famous Scopes Monkey Trial) will probably enjoy this version, but despite the facts that I was eagerly awaiting this release and that Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott are/were two of my all-time favorite actors, I was disappointed. The performances lacked the passion and just flat did not measure up to the original ones, with one exception--Lane Smith (the prosecutor from My Cousin Vinny) was his usual marvelous supporting self in the role of the minister. Still, it's not the worst movie you can rent; the play is so good it would probably be impossible to make a bad movie out of it and with the recent resurgence of the Evolution vs. Creationism debate, it is certainly topical.Also, if you want to see Jack Lemmon in a remake of a film classic that's excellent, try 12 Angry Men."
5,Landmark Courtroom Drama,"""Inherit the Wind,"" an electrifying drama, is based on the famous evolution versus creation theory of Charles Darwin. When a small Bible belt town learns that a young teacher has dared introduce his students to the theory of evolution, they jail him for teaching blasphemy. The courtroom face off brings together God-fearing Matthew Harrison Brady (read William Jennings Bryant) and Henry Drummond (read Clarence Darrow), Brady's worthy adversary. Written in 1955, the drama blasted McCarthyism. In 2011, the play gives us bombastic overtones of the current political scene. Overall, this is a testament, as Drummond puts it, ""to the right to think."" While I appreciate both the Jack Lemon, George C. Scott production and the Spencer Tracy, Frederic March film, my preference is to the intensity of the former."
1,For the gullible.,"One reviewer said that this film ""proves"" the Bible to be ""baloney"". It does nothing of the kind. All it proves is that Hollywood is steeped in anti-religious propaganda. The film is full of caricatures that make no sense. The so-called prayer meeting alone illustrates that the script writer has never attended an actual prayer meeting. The ridiculous charge that a Bible believer can't see reason or that evolutionism is equivalent to ""science"" or ""reason"" shows that there is not much intelligence in the whole structure of the film. The film itself is, of course, a propaganda reaction to the very serious evidence against evolutionism. No wonder that Hollywood's so-called stories ""based on a real event"" can't really be taken seriously."
5,A valuable piece of ART.,"I was only 14 years old when I watched this film. I remember its name as ""TRIAL OF APE"". The motion pictures then was pure like everything. No audio effects no visual effects no computers and no advanced technologies of to day. Pure and only art of Acting. I enjoyed it as much as 50 years ago. Thanks to those my old friends."
3,"Probably a good ACADEMIC book, but no action for managers","Everything in this book is actually common knowledge. The title should have served as a warning for my credit card. This book probably has all academic qualities, but little call or guidance for action. Stick to Davenport and Prusak's ""Working Knowledge"" book on KM for that and save your money on this one--there is nothing new for managers. A table in chapter 8 (and continued in 9) are good overall summaries that still do not make this book worth the cover price. Thumbs down to another ivory tower production."
3,Nice academic classification of some type of kn. transfer,"The book gives an interesting overview of all situations in which a very particular type of knowledge is transfered: the conscious transfer of experiences.There might be much more to know about transfer, but the writer certainly wanted to restrict to this particular domain.Even if interesting, I can't imagine that the content of this book is usefull for a knowledge manager in a company. It could even make him run into the error of simplifying too much and wanting to see every problem as a nail to hammer.Well, it was still interesting, because the book is written very structured."
2,chatty and repetitive,"These novels mimic the happy ramblings of an airheaded schoolgirl only too well. Colette can turn a nice phrase at will, but it doesn't make up for the insubstantialness of Claudine's thoughts about her experience of life."
1,What an unpleasant surprise ...,"Yes the concept of the book, a Victorian novel of a young girl married to a much older man, an unscrupulous publisher no less, led me to dish out the big bucks and buy this book ....If they said this book was steamy, it certainly was, but, the steam came from me in having to read this mush. I think they should have announced this book as ANTI VICTORIAN literature since sensuality is hinted at but never touched. Thats why I rate this book with one star since you can't have serious relationships and marriage between people that are decades appart in age without some sort of spice. The fact that the man in the book is a scumbucket is even more reason to delvelop this as a reality...Well yes theres the word .. reality .. which is what this book does not have.""Experiences of a young girl growing to maturity"" is what the covers says ... what it should say is that this is so boring and meant for readers that think watching grass grow is exciting!"
3,"DTS 5.1 Sounds Great, but the music has all been done before","I bought this CD based on reviews here on Amazon, but after listening to it I'm less than thrilled. The surround is well done and the sound is clean, but if you are a fan of Lee Ritenour, Dave Grusin and Dave Sanborn, you have heard all this music before, and done better. There is nothing new here for the Jazz lover, but if you want a very good sounding DTS 5.1 CD and you did not burn out on this type of music in the 80's, give it a listen, otherwise, go grab a CD by any of the above mentioned artists and see how this type of music should sound!"
3,Decent slasher,"The House on Sorority Row ranks as a pretty decent slasher, coming at excactly the right time. It's setting and overall athmosphere elovate it somewhat above lesser efforts in the genre. It wouldn't be fair to compare the film to the superior Black Christmas but in comparison to films like Sorortiy House Massacre, it comes off well. Director Rosman obviously has some style in him (lighting schemes, photography etc.), the kills are pretty good, the final ten minutes pretty tense and it's ambiguous ending a nice touch.All in all, if you're a fan of the genre, I'd say it's worth checking out. It's not one of the best slashers ever, but it's a decent entry."
4,somehow overlooked this gem...,"I was suprised to notice I had not seen this movie when I read the reviews. Considering the number of similar titles and themes, it it was easy to overlook, I suppose. This does separate itself from its peers in that the characters are more than cardboard cutouts, and there is less focus on the ""kill"" and more on the suspense. The story itself is really well done and there is a logic to it, though it does follow a similar format to other revenge themes. While the special effects are hardly special, they are not necessary when the story is compelling enough to hold your attention. Certainly an enjoyable flick for those (like me) who enjoy the occasional slasher film from the recent past with a bit of a twist."
4,Those Crazy Co-eds...,"A group of fun-loving sorority gals accidentally kill their shrewish house-mum. They dump her body in the grungy, algae-filled swimming pool, only to have the old girl disappear! Did she get out on her own, or is someone else at work? THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW is sort of the wacky, slasher-version of DIABOLIQUE, with the vanishing corpse, yucky pool, and all. I liked the college babes, as they were not all airheads (a few were). The stalker / killer was interesting in a Michael Myers way. The scenes with the harlequin costume and the head-in-the-toilet were grrreat! Also, the hallucination sequence was quite imaginative. THOSR is well above average and worth repeated viewings..."
4,Gotta Love Horror Movies Set In Sororities,"In the 80's there were a few horror movies using Sororities. There was Initiation, Sorority House Massacre and Hell Night, just to name a few. This one is among the best, and does have a few creepy moments. Not overly bloody, and a followable story line. The acting is pretty good too, considering it is an 80's horror film. I am really excited to see this out on DVD with a wide screen presentation. I will be showing this at my fraternity for horror movie night!!!"
1,Why Isn't The 2009 Anniversary Edition Widescreen Format???,"The old Dvd from 2001/2003/2005 (whichever!) states its Widescreen Format(1:85.1) with a Running Time of 93 min and Rated-R.The 2009 reissue DVD says its full frame with a Running Time of 91 mins and Unrated. (???)I'm glad that this release date got pushed back until January 2010 so that maybe I'll just cancel the new reissue order that I placed, and order an older DVD print from a private collector instead!This makes absolutely NO SENSE to me!?Can someone PLEASE shed some light on this for me if I am 'mistaken'?"
3,Widescreen or Fullscreen???,"FYI, in that era, many movies were shot ""soft matte"".This means that the celuoid negative is full screen and black masking is used for in the theatre and the full negative used for video tape releases. I don't know for sure if this movie was shot like that, but the earlier dvd release just has the black bars on the top and bottom giving you a ""fake widescreen"". Let me say again that all widescreen tv's that I know of will zoom a 1.33:1 to wide giving you the exact thing ""IF YOU WISH"". I'm not sure of the aniversary ed. but if it is full screen, then it would probly be the best edition. Assuming the original negative is fullscreen. That said, I do remember Eileen Davidson's nude sceene to be longer when I saw it at the movie."
4,Good for a cold/rainy day.......,"A good read for a quiet winters day, not a real long story, only 277 pages.Good story that keeps moving along and has as many twists and turns, as the trail that the young hero takes us on.Line up your friends and watch your backtrail."
1,wwll: air war,be ware this dvd failed to play property in real player or windows media player something iswrong with it.I am updating this review with a 5 star plus for this vender went far beyond what most vendor do to make sure that the product was correct in every way ---not to often that you will find a vender that stand behind his product as this vendor did.--bravo 5 stars plus--T.E.Hyer
4,A quiet night with the ones you love,This is one of my favorites! My mom sent it for our sons and we like it better than they do. Keep it out for a night by the fire with a cup of cocoa and your sweety. It has some of the most beautiful chalks and music I have ever seen or heard. Hope you enjoy it too.
1,Nothing like Free to Trade,"Ridpaths third novel is further evidence of a downward trend. The main character Nick is not someone who generates reader sympathy. What are we to make of him when he ditches his girlfriend in a critical scene mid way thro' the book? Or when he makes a play for his best friends wife? Nick is also naive in the extreme eg ""What exactly is money laundering?"". Nick is a drip who should have stayed in acedemia - why was he hired for his Russian expertise when no use of this is ever made by his bank? All the characters have faces which ""redden"" - even middle aged folk? Basic errors abound - Lord Kerton is about forty - then ten pages later he is near retirement age? The dialogue lacks conflict. The prose is laboured and pedantic. As someone else has mentioned - who can believe that a lone English guy can take on the Brazilian drug lords? Nice cover though."
1,A formula too far....,"This thriller is a little like a throw-back to the 1970s. The trouble is, the author's heart doesn't seem to be in it. Long lectures about financial matters, culled from financial journals, the internet or The Economist really don't make for a good novel, thriller or no. This story meanders slowly and predictably through a kidnap plot, adding a South American flavour, but none of this livens up a very tired idea. A disappointment."
2,just going,"I was disappointed with this read. The plot stretched credibility just a little too far to be an enjoyable read (academic becomes trader, gets mugged, girlfriend gets kidnapped, solves puzzle, tries to bring down trading house, gets girl back, rejoins academia, lives happily ever after. OK the summary is a little exaggerated but you get the idea."
2,Not worth it,This was easy to install and worked great for about 8 months. Then is started causing electrical problems with my turn signals. I shouldn't have to replace this every 8 months so I will be trying the Curt brand to see if it will last longer.
1,Disappointed Purchaser,"This product listing was misleading. While searching for a ride on horse for my daughter, I came across this listing. Because on one section it stated it had a wooden frame, I figured it was sturdier than it is. The quality is disappointing and the seller provides no opportunity for returns. Not a good purchase!"
2,toy misrepresentation,"World Safari Plush Black Horse With Realistic Horse SoundsProduct features and description contradict eachother. One place says the body is built on a metal frame another states it's on a ""sturdy wooden frame"". When doing research via other websites, I discovered that the horse is ""not a ride-on"", is constructed of metal frame, stands 26"", and weighs 8lbs. More contradictions with shipping weight and height. I would have been disappointed making this purchase since I was using the search engine to find a ""ride-on horse"" for my 3 yr old."
4,A Real Life look at Christianity,"I read this book, and was pleasantly surprised to find someone who took his faith so seriously, without being serious. Yaconelli is so clear with his portrait of the gospel, it startles. My only wish could be that the book were a little more organized, and that illustrations would not be repreated more than once. But I love this book, and am eager to read any of Mr. Yaconelli's work in the future."
5,The Greatest movie in the world!,If you are into old movies you must have this one! Also if you have any other Bogart movies you will enjoy this tape very much. It is totally intense and has some funny lines. I reccomend it!
5,I agree with all on this page that says this is the best,"this is the definitive classic. To me, it is the very essence of the word ""classic."" Casablanca defines that word. The actors are two of the best that America ever produced. How can you not like Bogie? This movie is flawless. Remember that rumor that Ronald Reagen was originally cast as Rick? Man, that would of destroyed this movie. There has been a re-make made and a colorized version made, but all Casablanca fans know to ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES. What eles can I say about a film rated no. 2 on the AFI's 100 greatest movies of all time, and rates about a ten out of five stars."
5,"You want suspense,adventure,and romance then get this movie!","I truly loved this movie. I liked the way Rick acted when he saw Ilsa for the first time, and the very end when she got on the plane. I would definitely watch this movie again, and so should you."
5,Best Movie Ever Made,Anyone who can appreciate a movie for aspects like casting & mise-en-scene will love this one. I first saw this when I was 27 and at the time HATED black & white flicks just b/c of their lack of color. I couldn't relate to the time it was filmed at all. And now four yrs. later this is my all time favorite movie ever just because of the themes addressed. Rent this one and you won't be sorry.
2,Definitely overrated - 2 1/2 stars at most,"Actors were pretty stiff in this movie. If you believe that uttering words is equal to acting, then this movie will not disappoint you. I could never understand how these actors could be so indifference and dead(!) while their dialogs supposed to be passonate and lively. I was very unconvinced watching their theoretcially romantic moments. I didn't think that they really care for each other. The real stars here are the screen writer and the song writer. And that is all you will get out of it. I keep this tape just to remind me that I should always rent the movie before buying it even it has great reviews."
3,Better than I expected,"I held out for a very long time before watching this film for the first time. With all the hype that comes with this film, as well as many other ""classic"" films, such as ""Citizen Kane"", I was expecting a big let down. I'm from the younger generation, and a lot of these old movies made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, just don't appeal to me most of the time. But I must say that this film wasn't that bad. The plot stayed interesting and the ending had a good twist as well. However, I don't think that this movie should be recognized as being one of the best films of all-time."
2,"Great Fun. Silly, but fun.","I love the taco scene. My other favorite scene is the on with the thing by the waterpark or whatever that is supposed to be.I am not sure of one thing, however. Why does Sam keep playing that song?"
2,"Lord, do I enjoy writing unpopular reviews","Yes. I know Casablanca is a classic, but I didn't think that it was very good. The acting was subpar and the storyline dull. A lot of the lines were so ludicrous that I found myself cracking up, much to the displeasure of my friends. I personally think that it is overrated, and had it been made today it would be shot down as a stupid romance that only girls go to see and then weep over. I don't think that it would recieve all the critical acclaim that it does. Of course, the reason it recieved such critical acclaim could be because it was one of the first of it's kind and whatnot. I, however, found myself not giving a damn if she stayed with him or left. So there you have it. The movie did not move me at all. Pun uninentional."
2,Don't believe the hype!!! I'd rather watch the Godfather.,"First, for anyone that does not know, widescreen format did not gain popularity until after 1950. Since this movie was released in 1942, there will never be a letterboxed edition. Second, I found the character Sam very shallow and subservient. I was appalled to hear Ingrid Bergman call him a boy. Third, the cinematography was closer to average than groundbreaking. Clearly, this movie was originally a play. The backdrop in the driving scene was more than obvious. The plot tended to be predictable. Orson Welles, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and many others have done much, much better.Much, much better."
1,How about releasing The African Queen on DVD instead of yet another edition of this movie?,How many editions of a movie do you have to buy before you get the ULTIMATE one? This is ridiculous! Greedy damn companies! Where's The African Queen and why is that not on DVD?
1,Grade B movie. Period.,"How on earth did this movie ever become such an icon? It's a low-budget, grade B, black-and-white movie almost all of which is set in a bar. It's even got a fake airplane. The only thing it's got going for it is a couple of big name actors. And they delivered routine performances. What, pray tell, is exceptional about this film? It's essentially a stage play and not a very good one at that."
1,Did not know it did not download to your device.,Since I am in an area that does not have good internet service I am unable to watch the movie I purchased. I thought it downloaded to the kindle for a period of time to watch at your convience. I will know in the future not to purchase any.
3,Casablanka not so HD,The movie is a classic. It is an old movie the HD is not fitting; it is not that high quality.I would recommend the movie but not the HD.
4,Romantic and Good,"Romantic movie setup during the nazi time. Keeps some suspense till the end and has a nice ending, full of love."
3,Pretty Good Set,"Not a bad three dvd set of the 70TH anniversary tribute to Casablanca.Being a Bogart buff I wasnt too unhappy with it.The first two DVDs are blue ray,the third with the classic film is regular DVD playable on all DVD players.The salute to Dir Mike Curtiz(Now Voyager,Adventures Of Robin Hood,Dodge City,and Elvis Presleys King Creole,among others)is well worth seeing(Its on the same disc as the film)The other extras include 4 Casablanca coasters,an informitive Casablanca hard covered book and a fancy case to house it all."
3,Disappointed,Love this film. Seller was in Quebec. They sent movie to me through USPS. The movie was broken. Contacted seller and they have no more available. They promised refund. I know this is not the seller's fault but I was looking forward to watching this movie.Would recommend this seller to anyone 100%. Things like this do happen from time to time.Movie is one of the best classics of all time.Looking forward to my refund.
3,dissapointed,Why is this DVD not in anamorphic format? Was the original 4:3? Its depressing to watch such an excellent movie distorted on a 16:9 screen. WB blew it. This applies to the other WB classics as well.
4,never got it,"Never got the movie, no response to email. I would be concerned if I had to order again from this seller."
2,Cheated and Used,"I already own a perfectly good dvd of Casablanca, but II bought this two disc set to get the Premier episode from the 1955 Casablanca TV series ""who holds tomrrow"".The show was complete up to the about 9 mins then it jumped to the end of the episode with and a commercial for a total of 17:50 of footage. I was really getting into this show and felt cheated and used when the complete episode was not shown. If the person at Warner Brothers who issued this disc had put in copy the words clips or highlights from the Premier episode from the 1955 Casablanca TV series I would not have bought it."
5,This movie.,Got drunk with a young lady and she decided that she wanted to watch this. Needless to say her pants were off 20 minutes into the film. Five stars for Humphrey Bogart. Five stars for vodka. Five stars for me.
5,A Must Have,"In earlier days when I had this movie on VHS I didn't think it was all great. But then about 5 years ago I got the 2 disc S.E Casablanca on DVD and really enjoyed it. And I realized why about 15 minutes into the movie; I could hear every single word clearly for the first time. And for a movie like this, it's an absolute necessity. You know how it is - if you can't keep up to speed with the movie you don't get the most out of it. I think this movie does deserve 5 stars, even though this rating is thrown around somewhat carelessly here in all the reviews"
4,Black & White For A Reason,"Ah, kids today. ""Man, it's crap if there's no color to assist my info-ladened cranium!"" Get a life. It's ""Casablanca"", for God's sake. It NEEDS to stay in B&W format. And, might I say, this film is a cult classic for more reasons than just minimalist acting. Dialogue: Heard of it, kids? It's what actors used to do instead of blowing (...)up or flying through the air in front of a blue screen. I love my DVD of ""Casablanca"", and cherish the fact that I don't have to rewind a tape to get to some of my favorite quotes."
5,Casablanca Was Never Better,"I will not devote my review to the movie itself, for I can't believe that anyone reading this has never seen the movie. Rather I will deal with the quality of the transfer to blu-ray. I own the two disc Special Edition dvd version of Casablanca and I could not believe how great it looked on my blu-ray player. Well, after purchasing the blu-ray edition of this movie and watching it on my blu-ray player, I was blown away! The quality of the transfer to blu-ray is beyond belief. The images literally pop off the screen! In addition, the blu-ray has all the special features of the dvd and some extras; such as, Michael Curtiz: The Greatest Director You Never Heard Of. If you don't already own this blu-ray version of Casablanca, run, don't walk, and purchase it. You will most definitely not be sorry."
5,Bogie's Best,"I didn't think that Bogie could top himself after the Maltese Falcon, but then he and Ingrid Bergman had the love affair of...well, all time in Casablanca. This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever. Surpassed in style, technique, and vision only by Citizen Kane. This is a good love story, one that even men will enjoy. What sets this apart from all the cheesy Hollywood romantic comedy chick flick hoopla is that in the end, they don't live happily ever after. A superb movie. Bogie and Bergman were at the top of their games, as was the whole supporting cast. Go see this movie NOW if you haven't already."
5,Simply the greatest film of all time.,"Even someone who isn't a movie buff can appreciate Casablanca. A dramatic, moody tale of romance, intrigue, danger, and despair. Your heart is tugged by Bogart and Bergman, and even the ever-dramatic Peter Lorre makes a memorable scene or two. What made this movie so much more interesting was not just the subject matter, but when it was released. At the very dawn of America's involvement in World War II, it was a rousing, if not slightly propagandist film, a film of defiance against tyranny, and a show of selfless love beyond even romance."
5,Casablanca Collectors Edition,"As advertised. Perfect gift for a Casablanca junkie! I especially liked watching with commentary, as that was a different experience and provided some fresh insight."
5,Casablanca,"one of the greatest romantic films of all time, great for everyone of all age. i recommend everyone to watch it and again and again."
5,Casablanca-the best movie ever made,"Casablanca is a wonderfly made movie and in most peoples opinions one of the very best. Ingrid Bergman is stunning as Elsa, a trouble woman in doubt of whether she sould go with her husband (Victor Lazlo), or stay with Rick, Humphrey Bogart, the man she fell in love with in Paris. Humphrey Bogart is also amazing as the owner of Cafe American. Casablanca is what I would call the absolute best movie ever made!"
5,"A Movie to Watch a 1,000 Times","This is one of the finest movies ever. It was produced during World War II in 1942. The filming of Casablanca has some very interesting facts and trivia. For example, the individuals that play the Nazis in the movie were all Jewish immigrants. I recommend reading the book, ""Round Up The Uusual Suspect,"" The Making of Casablanca."
5,"If you buy this, you already know why","Few people will buy his disc set who have not already seen the movie. There are a lot of ""things you didn't know"" as supplementary material, but the movie stands on its own."
5,A must in any video library.,"The title says it all. It's a rare tribute to those rare good guys in life, and if you like romance, it has that too."
4,No brainer,"This is a great movie, maybe the best ever made. The blu-ray makes the film gorgeous to watch. And the extra DVD material is pretty cool. The packaging is over the top, and the passport case is dumb, frankly, which makes this more expensive than it needed to be. It is also why I rated this as only 4 stars. Just give me the film. Leave the extra junk out."
5,Never Gets Old,"What can I say that hasn't been said before about this movie? For those few that have been living under a rock: Casablanca is about Rick a Cafe owner who ""I don't stick my neck out for nobody"" is his life's motto, and how this motto begins to wreck at him when his old flame (has Ingrid Bergman ever looked better?) comes back into his life.The movie has it all: Suspence, romance, humor (in spades), and that song!Watch it, just because it's a classic."
1,Not a fan,"I know this is supposed to be one of the most romantic movies of all time, but I could not relate with or feel sympathy for the female character. As a result, I didn't like the movie at all."
3,good,"Fast ship. No problems with the shipping, but I guess I need to make sure the next time I order, that when I correct the number (total) from 2 to 1, that the web site corrects it too. Didn't need two of this item, but I paid for them, and accepted the order, even though I had changed it to say only 1, not two. I'll never make that mistake again. After editing, we must all make sure it really edits the number."
1,"Horrid, too much scholarship","It starts with endless, endless commentary. You must fast-forward _FOREVER_ to get to the actual 5 star movie"
1,My Problem With This,"One of the greatest movies ever made and no one wants to release it in wide-screen format. Movies like Casablanca & Citizen Kane changed how most movies, even today, are filmed. Why would anyone want to watch it stretched out to the point where details & background get lost? I get dizzy watching the camera swing back and forth to the speaking characters. While the special features are pretty good, I didn't buy this for a documentary & WB cartoon. I bought for the film. It is time this film was given the proper respect it deserves. If it can be shown on Cable in wide-screen then I should be able to get the Special Edition DVD in wide-screen."
1,I received a blank tape of Casa Blanca from Amazon.com.,"I received a blank tape of Casa Blanca from Amazon.com. I did not try to view it until after the one month time limit, having no reason to suspect it would be blank. Also, I would not have known the video was blank unless I removed the cover. The system will not allow me to discuss this problem with a human being. Therefore I am very unhappy with the service from Amazon.com. Valerie Whelan"
2,RECEIVED NOT THE ORDERED VERSION,"Amazon, you did NOT send the version that I ordered of this movie..!! I wanted the COLORISED version, you let me believe you had it available, when I specified same, and I clicked on the colorised version. Then you sent the same old Black & White !! Do you have it available or not?? I'm still interested in the the color one...I can give this one away. [...]Annie Silva"
5,Casablanca (Ultimate Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] (2008),Casablanca is one of my favourite films anyways but this Blu Ray really does it justice and I like all the additions in the package!
5,"Here's looking at you, kid. For now and forever!","This is the film that launched Humphrey Bogart into cinematic prominence. After using Bogart in supporting roles during the thirties with their other stars like Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, et al., Warner Bros. finally gave Bogie a chance at the leading role here in this picture. A great story about a city of refugees during a very grim episode of World War II is presented in this film that truly is one of the all time classics."
5,Casablanca,"Still one of the greatest movies of all time. Humphrey Bogart at his best. Classic story of love, war and espionage. They just don't make movies this good anymore."
5,Simply the Best!,"The really don't make 'em like they used to. The acting is top notch (take a special look at Bogart & Claude Rains, very unlike the intricate nuances of a fine Keanu Reeves thespian performance), the direction is superb, the dialog is truly memorable (just notice how many lines from this movie made it to pop culture), and the story is simply unforgettable. This is one of the best movies of all time and if you haven't had the chance to see it, do give it a try."
4,"""Voiceover"" special distracting","Casablanca is unsurpassed as a movie and having it on DVD is well worth while. On the special following the movie, I found the monologue, over the film to be very distracting. Here, the film is rerun from beginning to end while a narration over it has very little to do with what is happening on screen. It would have been much better if the narration simply explained or amplified what was happening on screen. An even better alternative would have been to create an explanitory narrative (or use the existing one) but to cut and splice the film to match what was being said. The specials on the other disk, by Loren Bacal, were good. The cartoon bit, rather poor.carrollflys,california"
2,Dissapointing,"I may be the only one that thinks so, but Casablanca was a big dissapointment to me. I am a classic movie buff and have almost all the great ones, but this was so boring and Humphrey Bogart has no romantic appeal and no chemistry with Ingrid Bergman. I think this movie is known more for it's one-liners than the fact that it's a ""good movie"". I think the movie came out at a time when it was embraced because of world circumstances, but there have been many movies after it that blow it away."
2,"boring, bad plot","I thought the movie was going to be a lot better than it was. They could habve done so much more with the movie other than making it a boring, totally wrong love movie."
2,I didnt like it,"you know, i'll get like 1-300 helpful votes on this, but i didnt like this film. i honestly didnt like it. it seemed that humphrey bogart's character could do nothing but whine all the time about his love affair in paris and then get drunk at the bar. there were some powerful scenes, like when the opposing groups sang their respective nationalist songs and the ending was beautiful. but i just didnt like it. too melodramatic and humphrey whined too much."
1,Booo,"I can't believe people rave about this movie! I tried to watch it with my mother and stepfather. None of us were tired when it began, but we ALL three fell asleep. ZZZZZzzzzzz"
1,simple and naive,"Described as one of the top-10 movies of all time... I naturally had high expectations of it. However, the plot and the entire storyline are uncomplicated, very predictable, and naive. I assume it was made for mass audience, and at the time it was released, it may have been a hit. However, now it is more of a sleeping pill."
4,Excellent,It came quickly and is exactly as discribed. The picture quality is as good as the original film. I recommend this retailer.
5,Casablanca,"I love the old classics. But this one is one of my all time favorites. The actors are great and the love story and, of course, the notable lines keep me coming back to this movie...I watch it over and over!"
5,DVD Transfer brilliant,"There's nothing more beautiful than black and white on DVD. This transfer is absolutely flawless, and does this great American classic justice. It's like being in a theater again. If you're a hollywood purist, get a DVD player and throw in Casablanca. The rich details, great performances, and brilliant sound track will blow you away."
5,Almost The Ultimate,"This latest edition is certainly the one to have, with one or two reservations. A couple of newspecial features have been included but one is missing: the fascinating collection of telegrams,inter-office memos and production notes. These last appeared on the standard DVD two-diskspecial edition. And we have to talk about Blu-ray. While I understand it is the latest 20124K quality, there is no wide-screen version, no bookmarking and no BD-Live features available.That said, the full screen 4X3 picture is certainly pristine. Maybe those production memos willbe included in the 100th Anniversary edition in 2042!"
3,Casablanca used,I watched this show with expectancy having heard about it all my life. The sound quality is clear but inaudible. Had to listen keenly to hear what they were saying. I enjoyed it and am now in love with Humphrey myself. Don't know that I would watch it again but I certainly appreciate the fundations set by this movie which is indeed a classic.
3,Not that special.,"Casablanca is a good film but not a masterpiece. The story is bit boring but the love triangle is the best part of the film. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman had incredible chemistry together, they are magic on-screen. This little black & white film noir is a classic but expext some flaws. Take it or leave it."
3,Good but definitely not the best,"I was very excited when i first watched this movie because it is almost on top of lists of all-time greatest movies and the reviews are like wow.. this must be really one of the best! After watching it, I was kinda disappointed because I think the story is so-so, there is no chemistry between the two lead cast (but Bergman is very lovely though). I don't know what's so special about this movie. Did I miss it or what?"
2,Casablanca,"I thought this movie would be a lot better to tell you the truth. I found it to be rather boring at times. Being that its a classic movie I thought it would have a better plot! I guess I would give this movie a 2 star, for being so boring!I would not recommend this movie for somone looking for an adventure and action movie!"
3,Peter's review of Casablanca,"I found this movie engaging,considering it is nearly 65 years old.The lack of technological sophistication i.e.visual effects etc.is compensated by superb acting and a great script.The black and white of the film also works well for the genre.It is also just about the right length;not too long like some old blockbusters.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman display great on-screen chemistry and the movie progresses along at a brisk clip.The bonus features are also not too bad,keeping you informed of the main actors in some of the movies of that era."
3,CASABLANCA (1943) HUMPHREY BOGART,VHS QUALITY AFTER MANY YEARS FAIR ONLY. NICE IF IT HAD BEEN RESTORED AND PUT ON DVD FOR BEST QUALITY. BLACK AND WHITE VERSION MORE ENJOYABLE.
4,classic film great on hd dvd!,"no need to comment on the story!!!! classic as can be!! the hd dvd version is great and cleaner than any other representation before it, i dont think it will be the showcase of your hd collection but a great hd dvd all in all!"
5,Wonderful quality transfer,"The visual quality of the Blu-ray edition is absolutely terrific, almost unbelievably good. I doubt anyone has seen Casablanca this well since its original cinematic release in the 1940s."
5,The Best Love Story Of All Time!,"What can I say about this movie? It is simply the best! The plot, the actors, the setting, everything! Got to have this in your collection!"
4,Classic Film at the top,Casablanca uses the actors and the story to tell a very interesting and compelling story and is an all-time classic movie that should be seen by all.
4,One of my favorites!,"Casablanca usaually ranks as one of the top movies of all times and rightly so. Bogie is hard to beat in this role. A true classic that withstands the test of time. ""Here's looking at you"""
5,Awesome classic movie,This is one of the greats. A must see. Again and again. Some of the greatest movie lines of all time come out of this movie.
5,Excellent Transfer!,"The new digital transfer from the original nitrites is incredibly clear. The movie looks better than I have ever seen it. I haven't checked out the bonus material yet, but I screened the film as soon as I got it, and it looks awesome."
5,Eternal....,"CASABLANCA is a GOOD movie and is fast-paced and just happens to be right on target. No discussion is necessary. The script, cast and crew did a marvellous job. No question about it. Bergman is a revelation; she`s so youthful, fresh and her excitement and naturalness is a pleasure to behold."
1,Special Edition... PHOOEE!!!,"I'm holding out for a 16:9 colorized version with Dolby Digital EX 9.1! I mean when I watch Casablanca and I here the gun shot at the end, I want to HERE GUN SHOT AT THE END!!! Also Ingrid Bergman is no Maryland Monroe."
2,Over-Rated Rubbish!,"A classic? I don't think that I have ever seen such an artificial and boring love story in my entire life.I didn't cry. I moaned and groaned, and waited to get these two people that I didn't care about off my T.V. screen. I just did not like any of the characters. The actors were like lifeless cardboard cut-outs, reading their lines.It's an old classic to some, but definitely not for everybody."
4,Casablanca review,"The sound with this video isn't quite what it should be. I had to crank up the volume to hear some of it. Otherwise, it was good."
4,casablanca,Item was received very quickly by mail and as described. Had looked locally and was unable to find anywhere.
3,Bells were silly,"The dvds in the collection were excellent, but the remaining box space included tiny bells with place cards which were useless."
1,AGREE-NOTHING SPECIAL,"As a Casablanca fan, I wanted the best DVD version possible. I consequently ordered the Blu-ray version expecting a substantially improved version as compared to earlier releases. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The Blu-ray version is not noticeably better than the earlier versions. For someone who has an earlier version, I seriously question whether it is worth spending the money on the Blu-ray version. For someone who does not have an earlier version, it is a judgment call as to whether is worth getting the additional materials."
3,Definately not all it's cracked up to be,"Now that my synopsis line has made everyone mad, let's be open minded. This is a good film. Definately one of the best that the first half of this century has to offer. But really, a ""perfect film"" as it has been called so often? What about the poorly timed and ineffectively executed fist slamming scene Bogart has during his late night drinking binge? There are hundreds of problems like that with this film; little things and big things that permeate this film. Again, I thought it was good, but I can count dozens of movies off the top of my head that I enjoyed a LOT more. The dialogue is good, the acting is good, the visuals are good, the movie is good.The DVD is worth having. It's clean, it's pretty, and it has some neat stuff on it. But please, can we get off the ""perfect film"" thing?"
1,"great edition, worst amazon packaging ever","The boxed set is georgous and in line with other boxed set like Gone with The Wind, Wizard of Oz or Sound Of Music.The problem I had is again, the way amazon shipped the set, in a cardboard box exactly the size of the boxed set, causing no protection at all to shipping.The set arrived crushed on every corner and torn.Thanks amazon :-("
2,Takes a long time to get into,i watched this movie for an hour and i just couldnt get into it. It just wasnt my kind of movie...it is very slow to start the story line
4,Number Two All Time AFI; Number One on my list,The classic movie in high def. Sound remains MONO; I guess it would be nice if someone would spend time in the studio and create stereo or surround from the audio track. I guess most film purists would prefer to watch the film in its original audio. It would be nice to have multiple audio track options.
5,Casablanca,"The sbsolute best ""Classic"" film of all time......Bogart at his very best, Bergman was fabulous, Claude Raines terrific, Henreid wonderful and Conrad Veidt his most venemous. There is no better film!"
5,What DVDs were made for!,"Casablanca digitally remastered with sharp blacks and whites contrasting in the shadowy world of Rick's Cafe. This funny and heart-wrenching movie is finally done justice...and probably in the best condition since our parents saw it on the big screen. Who can out-sauve Humphrey Bogart, or fill a screen with more beauty than Ingrid Bergman? The short retrospective is fair, and the 12 odd previews are not in the best shape but hopefully a bone thrown to us as to what classic Bogie films are yet to come to DVD (or at least we can hope). This is a MUST buy for classic movie and DVD enthusiasts alike!"
5,The most noble movie ever made....,"""Casablanca"" is still being viewed and loved a half century after it's release because in addition to being a wonderful love story, it is an example of a real man doing the right thing. Bogart's code of conduct sends Ilsa away with her husband and though his heart is broken, he walks off into the fog, wisecracking all the way. If you love this film, try Robert Reford's ""Havana"" also. Alas, another star crossed love triangle, where you just know someone is going to get hurt in a very big way. The question is: will it be Redford?"
3,"Movie is great, quality of reproduction lacking","Casablanca is Casablanca. The movie per se speaks for itself. But, even at this late date, being my first Blue Ray purchase, I was not pleased with the overall quality of the reproduction process. I felt the contrast was poor and substandard. I have seen better on broadcast television."
5,"Here's Looking at a classic, Casablanca","One of my all time favorite films. This film has it all, drama, melodrama, comedy, political intrigue and even a few musical numbers. Bogart and Bergman have incredible chemistry and their performances draw you into the story like few other actors can. Casablanca has one of the greatest love stories ever told. Sometimes loving someone so much means having to let go."
3,"Almost, but not quite there","While the image restoration is really decent (not great though) the sound is no better than the previous BD release. The volume level fluctuation is as bad as on the original BD released only months before this one. Neither one, and for that matter the non Blu ray DVD too, even approach the sound quality of the Criterion Laser Disc from the 80's. If you own the first BD release keep it and don't waste your money."
3,"Well Crafted, Well Acted, And Unexceptional","I came to this film rather late, in my early 30s, without having any significant preconceptions concerning it. What I found was an extremely well crafted, well acted, well written ""studio"" film of the period... but nothing more. While the dialogue is quite good, the script is actually rather predictable. The cinematography is expert but equally unoriginal. And the film as a whole relies almost exclusively upon the talents of its performers to carry off both the predictable story line and the often slow pace of the film as a whole. While it may be almost unamerican to admit it, even after several viewings I fail to find anything remarkable in the film. It is merely a well-crafted film whose stars have been seen to equal and greater advantage in other films. That is all."
2,"great cast, lousy script","Casablanca is a classic but NOT because the story is so wonderful. Actually the script could be properly described as sentimental fluff. But what a cast --absolutely a director's dream-- Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Peter Lorre, Conrad Viedt, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid and others... Fortunately these talented people were able to transcend the silly script and made this movie a crowd-pleaser and a classic that's worth watching."
3,"You Can Keep Paris, I'd Rather Get the Girl","I know I'm supposed to like this movie, but I don't. Of course, it's got some great lines like 'Here's looking at you kid' (I use that one all the time) and 'Play it again, Sam.' The World War Two subplot also kind gets you, like some kind of turf war between rival gangs, the Nazis and the French. But what gives me the jip is the fact that Humphy lets that sweet kid go off on a plane trip into the fog with some dorky freedom fighter. Not me, brother. I'd rather peach that palooka to the Gestapo and grab the moll for myself, Paris or no Paris. The way I figure it is there'll always be plenty of wars going on somewhere. The main thing's not to pass up a class dame when she just happens to stumble into your gin joint, Rick. Claude Rains or Ingrid Bergman - I know who I'd rather spend the war with."
1,fornication,"same old story. immorality. fornication between rick and the chick. and what happened after this? bergomeister went and committed adultery and her children suffered for it. don't think satan has only been around since the beatles. he's been plying his trade for millennia. who paid to see it? rotten americans. they gratified their lust, and the movie made money. and the tale kept spinnin'. satan's got a real racket. bergomeister and bogey fell for his tricks and are you know where now. they were satan's pawns, just like america is. love of money, by mr. warnermeister, is the root of all evil. corrupt movie used by seducing spirits (demons) to lead the world to hell."
5,Casablanca,"In my top three favorite movies of all time. I could watch it a million times and never get tired of it. The performances by everyone are outstanding. Humor, romance and drama ... What more could you ask for?"
5,Classic,"This is one of the classic movies that should be in everyone's library, If you don't own it buy it."
5,Casablanca: 70th Anniversary,"Planned as a B movie, it became instead the all time classic. Rick's cafe is full of all the old time great supporting players - Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Raines etc. - but the pure pleasure of it is simply watching Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, and Paul Henried. They joined together and made this movie not just memorable, but the symbol of World War II Hollywood movie magic."
4,Great story and great acting,"Technical quality really amazing, story interesting and some people still have integrity. Bogart a great actor, and so is Bergman."
1,VERY overated,OK.. I don't understand why people praise this as the best movie of all time? I just don't find anything special in this movie. The film starts real sloooooooow and I almost fell asleep waiting for Bogart's character to appear and I waited half an hour for Ingrid's character to appear. A real dissapoinment!
3,Casablanca is overrated,"Maybe it's because of the detail in HD-DVD format, but I think Casablanca is a B-Movie at the most. The love story is not believable, Bogart is emotionless and delivers like he memorized the lines. Bergman does a credible job, except I don't buy her character being in love with Rick. Sure she had fun with him in Paris, but I didn't feel the love. That's the big deal about the movie, right? The effects were cheesy (maybe due to the High-Definition, they really show models as models) aircraft & buildings look like toys, the rear-projection car scenes are obviously not in a car.I had never actually watched this movie all the way through before. I have always seen clips and parts, but not the whole movie in toto. With all the hype and buildup I really had expected a better movie. The HD-DVD is great, with marvelous quality and clear sound. But the movie itself was not all it's cracked up to be (imho)."
1,Has not aged well at all,"I rented this waiting to be blown away. I'm still waiting. I expected a lot more action. I'm pretty sure I will enjoy it a lot more when Warner Bros finally gets around to releasing the colorized version, the way this movie needs to be seen - the world is not black and white, why should our movies be?"
5,For classic movie lovers best version,"This item was really great with all the additional options and I gave it to my sister for a birthday present. I wish I got a copy of it for myself when I opened it and I told her so. That made her want it even more, well what can you do it was a great present for a movie but and I would recommend it to anyone who like old movies with snappy dialog. It is a very clever move."
5,Best Ella c.d. ever!,"This is my favorite Ella Fitzgerald cd! While Louis Armstrong's singing is gravelly and rough, Ella is smooth as silk-- they make a perfect combo. Although nearly every song is absolutely gorgeous, Ella's renditions of ""Bess, You is My Woman Now"", ""I Got Plenty o' Nuttin'"" and ""I Wants to Stay Here"" are to die for."
2,Marginal Forro... there is much better available,"They should have called it ""Forro For The Holiday Inn""The music on the CD is well played, but suffers from sterile production. It's way too slick. I prefer my Forro with some guts.Avoid this one.For the real thing, seek out Meus Momentos by Luiz Gonzaga, Jackson Do Pandeiro or Os 3 Do Nordeste, if you can find one of their hits CDs. The Brazil Classics Forro CD is also much better."
3,Different,"This album was not what I expected it to be, although I'm not sure exactly what I expected...I was intrigued by the title. A warning: although the tracks are by various artists, each track is not by a different artist. I've listened mostly to bossa nova and tropicalia music in the past, and this is very different from those styles. The pace and mood are still upbeat, but its a harsher sound, not as beautiful to listen to with closed eyes."
4,Hookah,The hookah is great. The delivery was fast and the company was very helpful. They called and explained the various tobaccos and helped me pick some out.
2,Lightweight but tore easily,"I live in Florida and play mens softball. I have played the last 20 yrs. In the last 5yrs I went to turfs. I love those over cleats. First turfs I got from Zappos, and they were Adidas's. They lasted a long long time.Played in clay, water, small puddles and they kept going. Finally gave out, and I got my moneys worth.So went looking for new ones and saw these 3n2 on Amazon. Priced looked good and always heard 3n2 was good quality.I'd say I have worn these turfs less than 25 times since getting them.They are lightweight.I find it hard to tighten up the laces to get a good fit.But worse of all is that the pieces that hold the laces has already ripped and it about to bust. Once it does the laces will be useless. So if getting the lightweight requires this level or poor quality I'd rather have a heavier turf shoe. Pretty disappointed as I thought 3n2 was a quality product but seems its not.So I would not recommend them.M"
1,poorly made,The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe. The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless.
2,Not true to size,I ordered a size that I normally wear and it felt like it was almost 2 sizes bigger. Leather is all cracked while the sole is separating.
3,pro turf trainer,I like this shoe its comfortable and looks nice. The only thing that I've been disappointed about so far is that after I washed shoes on gentle cycle some of the pieces started to separate from the shoe.
1,Junk....do not buy,$63 for a pair of turfs that are falling apart after one game. 3N2 basically told me to get bent. I will stick with Tanel. Don't waste your time or $$.
3,Sydney? She's OK.,"Sydney is having a big 9 mths.Her mother is expecting a child.Plus Sydney is the reluctant editor of the new school paper.THEN, she has to deal with ""Attila the Hun"" (the cafeteria cook..and real battleax),And the new school teacher, Zephyr Kennealy, a total nutcase!!What a lot for 1 kid to put up with!"
2,Maybe I'm missing something,I've always been a Coogan fan but this was plain boring. I couldn't even get through it. The jokes seemed straight out of the 1920's.
4,WHO'S WHO ?,"That's the kind of movie I like. Great actors, action, suspense and some food for the mind.The director, Christian DUGUAY, made this ""B"" sci-fi movie SCREAMERS which was already terrific. Here, in THE ASSIGNMENT, he mixes real facts, the terrorist actions of Carlos, and a complex plot of the C.I.A. in order to eliminate him. And the mixture works !And there is the final scene in a lake which deserves to stay in movie history.A DVD to discover. You won't regret it."
5,"Awesome, action-packed, very enjoyable! Worth renting.","Very nicely done action-packed, edge of seat type movie that I really enjoyed watching. Well-paced and Aiden Quinn was a great pick for the lead. Well-rounded supporting cast. Very realistic and believable. Ending left a little to be desired but all in all, excellent."
2,There is really not much plot,This is a predictable spy-espionage movie. I bought this movie and was fairly disappointed because I'm a Ben Kingsley fan. Acting is mediocre and you can tell that this is budget-constrained movie.
2,A mediocre film.,"There is nothing spectacular about this film. Adian Quinn and Ben Kingsley have acted decently, but overall, the film fails to deliver. Aidan Quinn's training scenes, which take up most of the movie, are pretty lame. Ben Kingsley dies unnecessarily and Donald Sutherland's acting is awful, at best. The plot could have been utilised more fruitfully and in the end, one is filled with huge disappointment for having wasted it."
3,Good,"This is a decent thriller that I saw in really limited release in the theaters, after which--in only about a week--it was pulled. That it's about a real terrorist hightens the experience of viewing the film. It's a bit contrived in spots, and the narrative is out of balance. It's a bit of a B movie through much of it, but a decent B movie that perhaps didn't deserve to be so overlooked."
5,Quite disturbing.,"One of the best films I've ever seen. Great action, great plot twists, great drama, HECK, GREAT EVERYTHING!! I highly recommend it to drama, thriller, or action fans. The film is almost a psychological thriller as you see how cold blooded killing effects the main character's mind. A powerful and disturbing film."
4,Awesome,"No this movie is not accurate about the real story of Carlos the Jackal,you want that then watch Carlos with Edgar Ramirez witch is another great movie. But the Assingment is a great movie with good action,good acting and a great story and a very good movie"
5,Absolutely Spellbinding,"I,ve read all of William Sarabande, novels.The first 4 are the best.Actually I am in my 3rd. time around reading these 4.The historic details are fascinating and accurate as far as any one of could know.The character development is so real.The emotions,both negative and positive,any one of us could identify with,and the love story of Torka and Lonitis unforgettable. My 3rd time around ,and I can,t put these books down.What a incredible talent this woman has for telling a story. I wish she would have continued on to write a story about Manaravak and Larani,as they ventured forth southward into prehistoric North America."
5,A classic!,Couldn't put it down. High adventure. Unforgettable characters. A story based on solid research. This is a novel to savor and then set aside to read again and again.
2,POOR ME!!!,"I could not get through this book. The constant drag on the story as one character after another beat themselves because they were ""unworthy"" for one reason or another was just too much to bear. All I can say is ""Poor Me"" for struggling through 130 pages of this book. Any suggestion for another series like this that isn't Feminist junk? Would love to know what it is."
5,the most detaild adrenalan raizing book ever made,"this is a book that will have you on the edge of your seat. Feel you heart pound faster with every page. An epic advenchure about the remains of a small band of cave men from the last ice age struggaling for their very lives after a crazed wolly mammoth leaves there villige reduced to pieces for the loss of its loved one. The small group must learn to live new ways and advance for there very survivle. On there trip they will meet the most dangerous animal of all human beings. the evil galiena and the dreded gost men. they will also meet wolves, cave bears, saber tooth tigers, and wolly mammoths on the way to a new better land just one thing stands in there way the cordorr of storms."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I had anticipated from the other customer reviews that this book would be similar to the Auel ""Earth's Children"" series. While both take place in humankind's prehistory, I'm afraid I found little else in common. Particularly disturbing was the widespread misogyny and violence against women portrayed as part of the culture of the humans at the time. I also found the author's often excessive descriptive sytle distracting at times - a little more simplicity would have been appreciated. The main character, Torka, was difficult for me to connect with and I felt his character development to be abrupt and without explanation. I'm afraid I'll stick to Auel's perhaps more utopian, but certainly better written, view of this time period."
5,A Legendary Story,"I could imagine people telling this story around a fire thousands of years ago. It has a mythical, ancient quality with all the traditional archetypal characters: The Hero, The Enemy, The Maiden, The Innocent Child. The action, adventure, suspense and love are all perfectly balanced. The hero Torka and his mate Lonit have such a tender relationship, and their discovery of an orphan adds greater warmth to the story. The primitive struggle to survive is what fuels the story, but love and courage is what pushes them forward to a new land and a new way of life."
5,Boyond the Sea of Ice,This is just one in a series of books covering generations of families. When I finsished the series I felt like I had lost part of my own family. I hope Mr. Sarabande continues the series.
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I bought this after I read all the reviews and it did not disappoint. Beautiful illustrations albeit dated, but the technique still applies. A lot of content. I'm hoping to delve into it more during the holidays."
5,"Artist, Teacher or both","It's hard not to love this book in my opinion. Many don't consider illustration an art, but Loomis has a way with words that speaks to me. Enjoy it for what it is, not for what you think it should be."
5,Creative Illustration,"If you don't need to own an original copy, this is a great reprint of a classic book! Nice quality!"
5,Simply the best book on painting techniques that is available,"I own dozens of art technique books and have done illustration professionally for over twenty years and I have to say that the techniques presented here can't be found anywhere else - I've looked! If you think the price is too high well, remember... you get what you pay for. And here you get the best."
5,The BEST Art Book,"If you buy one art book, this is it. If you buy 100 art books, this is the first one you buy."
2,Paint comes off easily?,"Nice looking pan, and I haven't used it yet, but just putting the handle on and taking it off has taken the paint off, which seems odd. I don't think it will hold up well. Would I buy again? No."
2,Imperfections in finish,"Outset QN77 Copper Nonstick Grill Skillet with Removable Soft-Grip HandleI have one of these I purchased locally and love it, but the 2 I ordered here came with imperfections in the finish both inside and on the bottom. Since this will effect the non stick feature, I returned both skillets to the vendor. I am still waiting for a refund."
3,Copper Nonstick skillet,This product preforms very well. It fit most grills and the removable handle is great. Food cooks evenly and well. It is hard to clean up if you don't use the right spray or oil. It also discolors very easily.
1,Waste of Money,"This is the most useless book I have ever seen. It is nothing but a list of cliches. There is no history, not even definitions, just a list, and in no particular order. I cannot imagine what possible value such a list would have for anyone, regardless of their purpose in acquiring it. This book is not worth the postage, much less the $10 the author is charging for it."
3,mini amplified,"Very handy,but easy to lose! Needs to be about an inch larger. I like the cover. Publisher might consider adding the Old testament. Add a small concordance and it would be great for travel. That would be awesome!I've been to bible school and never was introduced to this helpful tool. Today, it is a very close friend! I really appreciate the Amplified. Thanks publishers!"
2,"Excellent bible translation, very bad print quality.","The bible fits your pocket very well, however the print quality is pretty bad, from blurry to crossed prints, extremely uncomfortable to read, unless you want to keep rubbing your eyes. Not recommended unless print quality is improved significantly. Get the other full version, AMP for mass market, cheap paper, but the print quality is so much better."
2,Print too small,"I love the Amplified Bible, but this one has print that is too small for me. I would rather the book be larger rather than have to settle for such small print."
5,beautiful little Bible,... & excellent translation. My husband and I love to read and learn the Bible even more now that we have an Amplified Bible. The Joyce Meyer one is esp. good w/ her Life Points etc.
5,Great for cases that don't have the proper amount of tapped holes for the motherboard,These will support the corners of a motherboard if your case doesn't havethe proper amount or locations of tapped holes for regular standoffs.
5,Excellent!,"This is a wonderful video. The best part of the video is the end when all of the acts get together and sing. My personal favorites whom sang with Pavarotti are Boyzone, Ricky Martin, Gloria Estefan and Mariah Carey. I highly recommend it if you love Pavarotti or just to help a good cause."
4,An Entertaining Movie,"This movie is for kids, and in that sense, it does a fine job. Not too scary, a little silly/funny, but a moving storyline. There are some oddities that probably resulted from translation, and it may be more compelling in its native language (some of the songs seemed particularly odd), but it was, all in all, an engaging and entertaining movie."
3,Not for everyone,"I liked this movie quite a bit, but the friend I watched it with didn't. The story is very strange, almost incomprehensible at times. I generally don't like it when computer animation in mixed in, but here it actually worked pretty well. If you like computer animation and don't mind your anime being pretty weird I would recommend this tape. Also, keep in mind that some of the other reviews posted for this animated movie were actually referring to the live-action film produced by the same director."
4,bizzare plot with unique animation,"This Hong Kong production is an interesting change of pace from Japanese anime.The plot is bizzare view of ghosts, ghost busters and life paths. A clue to understanding this film is identifying the ""standard"" life path and how the ghosts are opting out.The animation style consists of 2-D characters on a 3-D computer generated background. I found it impressively surreal, but exhibiting an element of harshness. It was less ethereal than the reference standard Princess Mononoke (2-D characters on nature paintings background)Those who prefer English dub should switch the audio to Cantonese for the songs, you'll notice the meter flows better. (I listen in Mandarin with subtitles and switch to Cantonese for the songs)This isn't really ""anime"" by otaku definition. I give it a good score for its unique Chinese flavor not found in other animated films. Not quite a masterpiece, but worth seeing."
3,"Fabulous animation, but what storyline?","I didn't see the live-action movie and had no idea what this was about. I bought this one based on its ""award winning"" designation (it won some animation festival somewhere). The good point is that the animation, which is a combo of computer and conventional animation, is superb. It *looks* really cool and is cool to watch. On the downside, the storyline itself is almost non-existent, something about a boy who's in love with a ghost. Not much plot to keep me interested, so fortunately the animation kept me interested. Also, the English dubbing is not that good, on par with your typical Saturday morning over-acting. If you're an artist or animator this may be interesting, but if you are a new animation fan or a parent looking for a good foreign anime, you'd do better with Hayao Miyazaki."
3,Well,"It is not the best, the live action version is better. This anime is long but the I like the story."
1,"Only 1 pen, not 12.","The description says you get 12 pens, but you only get one. Yes $1.90 is a fair price to pay for 1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid $7.46 for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good."
4,DogBones NeckBones,i got it for travel but it is too big for me to take on. Plus i like to keep it clean and that is not possible. So i keep it in my reading room and for yoga it works well. Neck is supported and make you feel good as you rest in yoga postures.katia
4,Love it,"I have owned one of these pillows for several years. It has been washed and broken-in well, my husband tried it out and decided it was now his pillow, so I bought 3 more because I can no longer find them in the stores here. The only thing is if you are a smaller person you will probaly have to break the pillow in a bit before it really becomes comfortable....."
5,Bought this for my mother,This came in a package with other things and they were all in perfect condition and the boxes were not torn or ragged like some things that I have ordered.
5,A winner,Used daily and very pleased with the comfort. Recommended by upper cervical chiropractor and use it as suggested. Very pleased with the quality and looks of the pillow.
1,Surprised!,"I was very surprised by this product because it had received such good reviews by everyone. I didn't like it at all. I must say it's exactly as described, but it had way too much stuffing for me. It pushed my head very far forward and was very uncomfortable. I removed about half the stuffing and it's a little better (hard to believe how much stuffing is in those things)!! I took it along on an airline flight, and it was so uncomfortable that I couldn't use it, but it sure did take up a lot of room in my carry-on. I plan on removing more of the stuffing, and I think eventually I'll get it to where it's comfortable. I'm going to put it in my car. When I opened it up, I put it back together with velcro rather than stitching the seam closed. That way I can remove or put more stuffing back in if needed in the future."
5,Great for airplanes,"This is the only pillow that I've found that helps me sleep on the airplane! I've found it a bit bulky to stuff in my carry-on, though it's worth it for overnight trips."
4,I love this dog bone pillow!,"I bought this pillow thinking it would be good for my massage therapy clients to lay on. However, most clients voted for a memory foam pillow, so it migrated to my home. I use it every day, as a lower back support and as a neck roll. I take it on vacation. I saw them for sale in a truck stop in Abilene. They really are great, and I love mine!"
4,THIS REVENGE IS REALLY SWEET,"Just when you think the author can't get more creative with revenge scenarios this little gem pops up. Yes, one of our girls gets the last laugh and it is quite a good one. The side stories are interesting also so jump into this and enjoy.This series is one of the most entertaining reads to happen is a long while."
1,Not worth buying,"If you are a thinking person, this book is not for you. I could not finish the book, it just could not draw me in. It is comparable to a daytime soap opera, and I am not a fan of soap operas."
1,"Undeveloped, unbelievable","I find it hard to believe that people will seek another four books in this series if they are as frivolous and trivial as this. There were inconsistancies in the plot i.e the party invitation that was supposed to be delivered late, and none of the characters had depth, I certainly had no empathy with any of them. I waited in vain for the plot to develop and improve. Fortunately I was listening to an audio version so because I walking for exercise the time wasnt totally lost."
1,used sweet revenge book by fern michaels,"ORDERED SWWET REVENGE THRU AMAZON. COM. IT WAS SOLD FROM BEARBOOKS AND THEIR RATING WAS VERY GOOD!!!!!! I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE IT A GOOD. BOTTOM OF BINDING WAS RIPPED ALMOST AN INCH UP AND ACROSS FRONT COVER, WHICH I HAD TO TAPE. ALL THE EDGES WERE WORN AND CURLED, WHICH I ALSO TAPED UP. ALSO THE PAGES WERE YELLOWED. THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT RETURN IT WAS BECAUSE I FIGURED IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH.THE OTHER 2 BOOKS FROM BEARBOOKS -(FERN MICHAELS-WEEKEND WARRIORS AND VENDETTA) WERE LISTED AS NEW AND WERE FINE.I CERTAINLY WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM BEARBOOKS AGAIN THO AS I WILL BE AFRAID OF WHAT I RECEIVE.AT THE SAME TIME I ORDERED 2 USED BOOKS (FERN MICHAELS-PAYBACK AND LETHAL JUSTICE). THEY WERE FROM FLY-BOOKS AND WERE LISTED AS GOOD. ONE WAS LARGE SIZE AND THEY WERE BOTH LIKE BRAND NEW."
3,Sweet Revenge - Fern Michaels wrote this one in sleep,"This book is not as good, not near as riveting or interesting as the others. Looks like it was rushed out, along with the next one too. If'd I'd read this first, I would not have bought any of the others in the series. Come on Fern Michaels, and write like you're paid to write! Are you using a ghost writer, or drinking while you're writing? Boring and doesn't wrap up to grab you for the next one or anything else."
3,Revenge Continued,This book continues the tale of women who are seeking revenge for injustices. The book is well-written and less violent than the second book. The story captures the reader's attention and keeps it with some well-written dialogue. The continuing saga between one of the women and her district attornery fiance is allows for continuation of the storyline.
2,Not the best in the series,"I love the Sisterhood series, up until this point. Sweet Revenge was defintely not a favorite. I wouldn't have bought it had I known it wasn't as good as the last four. Honestly, the first book seems to be the best. It seems like Fern Michaels has lost interest in her Sisterhood sisters.I felt like there were so many things that could have happened. It seems like Fern Michaels set us up for so many different options of what could happen and then just sort of killed the idea. It was short and seemed rushed.This series was my all time favorite books, what better to read about than revenge. It's disheartening to think that the writer is losing interest. Some details seem to be fogotten, sometimes, but I learned to over look them."
4,Very bluesy RnB tunes,"A great moment of groovin' music with top quality tunes.A ""must have"" RnB live recording.I rated ""4 stars"" (instead of 5) because of the sound which is a little ""flat"" (it comes from analogic tapes)."
2,Not a bit of freshness to Horace Silver's masterwork!,"Musical projects based on singing lyrics to jazz standards are not to my taste. Just because they usually do not add a least bit of motivation and artistry to the original instrumentals. Horace Silver is a particular victim of that situation. In other words, I do not know any vocalized effort on his extraordinary work worth listening to except Mark Murphy's ""That's how I love the blues"" ... All Blue Note albums by Horace Silver - the great composer, pianist and combo leader - ... I'd rather have them all. Make your choice."
1,Offset dialog screens,"Story and picture quality aside, it is very annoying that the film seems to have been transferred off center. From the opening titles to the dialog boxes, anywhere from one to three letters of the printing are missing on the left side of the screen. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"No Thanx , Man","This film, like most of his early work, is for Hitchcock aficionados only. I am an admirer of Hitchcock and also enjoy old British films, but I still found this movie tough going, not least because of the 110 mins running time. The picture quality of this Laserlight DVD is not perfect, but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you'd expect for the price. The musical score is also okay, but nothing to write home about. Laserlight do however pose a mystery that Hitch himself would have been proud of. This DVD has no commentary, no documentary and no trailer, not even one of those awful Tony Curtis intros. So why do Laserlight describe this DVD as a 'Special Edition' ?"
5,This really is a fine movie,"Fun to watch a legitimate silent film. The story is good, touching and relatable. I enjoyed it so much I bought a friend a second copy for Christmas."
3,Time travel!,"What a great pleasure to watch old silent movies. The Hitchcock collection 1 provides you very good movies: The Manxman takes place in Polpero, England, and is a bit slow, but an injoyable and - as always with Hitch- sad love story. The Ring is a model for Raging Bull (Scorcese)and quite interesting, because Hitch plays with the polysemie of the word: sad love story, but great film. The more interesting film is perhaps BLACKMAIL: first english talking movie ever! And, years before the best Hitch american movies, watch the scene, after the murder, where the heroine listen a woman speaking about knive... knive...Knive. Of course, you have a boring movie (The skin game) but the pack worth his price. Images are OK and the sound is quite good for such old movies."
5,Wave Board for Christmas,"I bought two of these for kids #2 and #3 for Christmas.They were off and running on these right out of the box. Of course, they use these in PE at school, so they are not novices.They are using these on the neighborhood concrete driveways and sidewalks. I do not see where there will be a wheel wear issue on this type of surface, but I could see how wheels would get worn down quickly on any rough stuff.If you are an old geezer, like me, with decent balance and athletic ability, you will enjoy using the wave board too. It took me about 20 minutes of practice to be able to get the hang of it and not look like a complete dork.As always, Amazon came through and shipped quickly with no hassles."
2,"fun, while it lasted....","Yes, this is a new kind of sports toy for the kids to ride. Great for using your body and balance. Was ok for the first 2 weeks, then we noticed that the back wheel especially, was flaking away and chunks were falling off of it. Made for a very bumpy ride. Tried to replace the wheels by ordering new ones, but do to command for them they are back ordered? Not really sure, when we are to receive them. So it worked for the first 2 weeks and now it sits. Didn't think it was too expensive at the time of purchase, but for something that can't be used, I wouldn't have paid what we did for it and have it fall apart so soon."
3,Great fun - eats wheels,"The Wave 'street surfer' is fun to ride and easy to master. Everyone I run into with it is amazed because when you look at it with its two inline skate wheels it doesn't seem it should work. But it does and with the twist of your hips or the tipping of your feet you can move and steer easily.The only problem with it is the longevity of the wheels. I'd have to guess that it's because it uses wheels designed for inline skates. Inline skates have 4 wheels per skate, 8 wheels per person. This has 2 wheels and the full weight of a person atop them. Despite the Wave's website claiming that their wheels are 'specially designed' I've found that they last no longer than run-of-the-mill roller blade wheels. The rear wheel flattens in no time. ""Cheap"" wheels are $10 a pair and at the rate this thing eats them it begins to add up quickly. If they can come up with a harder wheel they'll have a winner.Jim"
5,Excellent Table,"The truth at first seemed somewhat complicated because I had never ridden in a way, but once you mount the instructions that come with the table, and makes you much easier to use and learn. The video tutorial is very helpful"
3,Good Buy,I got this board for my nephew. The art is really great. It came very quickly too which was a bonus.
1,Cheap Plastic that Cracks from normal use,I bought one of these several years ago. I was riding it within a few minutes. I am an adult (under 200 lbs) and don't do anything fancy with it. I noticed after riding on occasion over a few weeks that small hairline cracks started forming on both platforms where the torsion bar inters the plastic. This is not properly engineered and I would guess that someone doing tricks on this board could easily break the plastic.
3,hard to conquer,"I bought this for my daughter for her 8th birthday. Perhaps that is too young because she cannot get it. My older girls tried it to no avail. I tried it, and I consider myself a very coordinated person. I cannot do it. My sister, also a mom, also very coordinated, could not do it. I see people riding these things all over town, so I know it can be done. I am in awe, and try to study their movements as I see them. It feels impossible to me. So, it has been sitting in the garage for almost 4 months, winter is coming on, I don't know if it'll ever happen. I keep thinking I'm going to take it down to 'skateboard corner' and have the local 'rif raf' teach me. But how would that look? Like I'm flirting with the local 'rif raf' that's how. Nope, we'll just have to bring it out next spring and try again."
1,boo-hoo,I am a girl. I never skate boarded ever. It does'nt intrest me. Santa got me a silver hi-tide board. Hi-Tide! from the makers of the wave it said on the box. I got teary eyed. I didn't try it. My dad did and fell off. I'll never use it. I like dolls and animals. I'm a tom boy but not a 'gnarly grinder.I'm only 9. Box said ages8 and up. We are returning it. Buy this to break someone's heart!
5,JUST LIKE SNOWBOARDING,"The board is very neat and fun. I am 36yr old female and it took me about one hour to get very good at it. I tried snowboarding once and yes i would say it was like snowboarding but can't speak for surfing or skateboarding. But with the Wave board i doubt someone can go down a steep mountaing like they can with a snowboard. My wheels are doing good after many weeks of use but don't wanna pay $20 for a pair of wheels. You can get an 8pack of wheels for $26 at Dickssporting goods. Also, it is excellent exercise for your legs. When you are first learning though for the first 30 minutes it doesnt seem like it, because you keep forgetting that it is selfpropelled and whenever you come to an incline you just STOP. But once you realize you have to keep moving and twisting it is very good exercise."
5,A Kid Favorite,"Sturdy, stylish, and loads of fun. To an adult, it looks impossible to ride, but it doesn't take a determined kid very long to learn and have fun. Promotes coordination and balance. A cool way to navigate for pre-teens and teens. Safety is a concern- address that with your kid, and you will both be happy."
4,Great Choice for Someone Who likes Skateboarding.....,....but would like a little change. It's a little tricky to get use to the wiggle motion. Most people say that's what they don't like. I like the fact that your feet never touch the ground (unless you fall off!) and you can make smooth turns.The Wave Ripple Junior Street Surfing Board-Little RippyGreat for smaller people.
5,The best skateboard he's ever ridden,I bought this for my 10 year old and he has been having a blast with it. It rides very smoothly and once he got the hang of using it he has been skating all over the neighborhood practicing new tricks. He no longer uses his 4 wheel skateboard. Definitely recommend this for anyone who likes to skateboard.
4,Lots of fun!!,"This board is awesome!! It's hard to get the hang of at first, but once you do, its a lot of fun! It can be hard to balance when your first learning, so wear sneakers and a helmet!"
5,satisfied,I got this for my 16yr old son and he loved it!!! I still cant figure out how to ride it but all the kids around our neighborhood love it and I got it at a pretty good price.
5,Wave Board,"This is a great product that my kids (and I) have enjoyed for countless hours so far. There is a learning curve, especially if you have not had much experience skating before. My eight-year-old is still trying to get the hang of it, but he is coming along. Amazon gave us a very good quality board at a great price and delivered it in plenty of time for Christmas, when other stores in my area were all sold out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves skateboarding, surfing, wakeboarding, or snowboarding."
4,Nice protection but awfully expensive for what it is,"Good to have, fits pretty good, but is pretty wrinkled as volant jams it into a envelope type package. Should work good, but in no way was worth what they charge for it."
2,"3dfx is gone, take care","NVidia (of GeForce fame) has purchased 3dfx (maker of this card) - and NVidia has no plans to continue the Voodoo product line. Could still be a great 3D card, at the right price, and if you don't mind no support..."
3,The time for 3dfx has come and gone,"In its day the Voodoo 5 5500 video card was a great card. But times have changed since 3DFX went under and was bought out by Nvidia. As of Dec 2000, there is no official driver support for the 3DFX line to include the 5500 AGP. The graphics are still outstanding today Jan 2002 but the card is showing it's age and is nowhere near as fast as the Nvidia Geforce line-up. The un-official driver support is terrible and will cause more problems with your graphics card than you care to deal with ( I know!). If you still decide to use this card be warned.....there is NO drivers that work well with windows XP! Still, it is a good card that runs well on any windows operating systems before Win XP. As long as you don't mind cutting edge tech and blazing speeds on newer games."
3,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO CARD!,"I have heard that 3DFX is coming out with an even better video card in just a few months! When it comes out it will blow this card right out of the water. Details are a little scketchy right now, but i've heard talk of an even bigger card on the rise a fter that one. So if you want a better card simply wait a few months and you will have the bes one on the market.||Exodus||"
4,Haven't had a single problem yet! Wonderful card,"I am sick and tired of stupid marketing words like FPS, mtexels/sec, fill rate, and mip-mapping.It's all junk and worthless.I bought this card because the GeForce cards are very picky about motherboards and voltage settings. I don't know about you, but I don't have the time nor the inclination to change my voltage settings or AGP aperture size.The V5 installed in 1 minute and it hasn't crashed on me once since I started using it.I play Unreal Tournament all the time now with all the details maxed out and it never slows down.Get this card if you are sick and tired of computer add-ons not working and spending time on msg boards looking for answers to ridiculous questions.The card is easy to install, stable, and will run any game you have smoothly.That's it, it's just that simple."
2,Not as good as i thought...,"I picked up my card on the very first day of the release. I removed my old drivers from my OS (delete the old files, not just uninstall it) and put in the V5 55oo. Well...I had a nVidia TNT2 Ultra card before and i hoped for some serious improvements. But i was wrong. The card gave me some improvement in games and the so called ""fsaa"" feature is nice, but overall i was very disappointed, because in high resolutions it is not fast enough on my PIII600 and the fsaa feature makes the picture very blurry. I brought my card back and own a nVidia Geforce GTS card now and i have to say that this was the right step to do. Please, dear customers, before you order that card, make sure that you like blurry pictures in games, make sure that your processor is fast enough (650mhz and above), otherwise you'll be very very sorry!"
1,This card sucks,"When I looked at this card back in feburary of 2001 i thought it was a good card. I installed it to windows ME and it worked great. BUT Try installing it to any windows NT platform and nothing but trouble. I did not expect for thier crummy software to work with NT but at least the driver so I could have a decent resolution, and that did not work. The worst thing is that 3dfx is NO longer a company. That means NO support in any way. I screwed up my computer numoruos times because of that stupid driver (that does not work).I STRONGLY recommend NOT considering this card. ATI, pny technologies and Radeon are the best. Voodoo used to be a great card but their time of fame has gone and they need to go out silently."
1,"It's a little late, but...","This video card is terrible. Okay, so 3dfx don't exist any more, but let this be a lesson to you to always research before you buy. The Voodoo 5 was such a bad card that it is used as the standard against which bad products are held in the gaming community right now. The positive reviews were from people who loved 3dfx back when they were a good company that did good things. There is a reason they went out of business after releasing this card."
3,3dfx Leaves The Graphics Card Business,"Just an FYI people. Just read over at CNN's Technology Website that 3dfx has closed the doors on their Graphics Card Manufacturing Facility. They will only be selling their graphic chips to second party vendors from now on to produce future Graphic Cards. I almost just bought one of the Voodoo 5500's since I was in the market for a new card since S3/Diamond, maker of my currently lousy Diamond Viper II has also stopped producing Graphic Cards. I went with Creative Labs Geforce 2 GTS, hopefully they'll be around for awhile. Oh, and the Creative Labs Annihilator 2 was only $199 using Amazon's $50 off coupon which is currently available."
2,Irritatingly opinionated and somewhat naive,"It might not be a bad book as an introduction to the ethics, it is very readable and covers most important areas of the subject of ethics. However there is no appreciation and respect to the complexity of the matter, authors heavily present reader with their opinions on the multiple moral dillemas and philosophycal questions. And what is even worse present their vision as the final and indisputable truths based on some quite primitive arguments."
3,"easy read, but misleading in parts","The book does attack many of the current ethical problems, but while it tries to present several sides, it consistently comes down on the politically liberal side while giving short shrift to competing views.For example, he does tip his hat to John Locke and John Stuart Mill, but does not give a thoughtful hearing to the idea of property rights and how the concept of just ownership can be used to attack environmental problems.He is in awe of the Marxist platitudes of economic equality."
3,a little square,"The arrangements and the choices of tunes are a little on the square side. I'm sure it would be possible to play material like ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" as jazz, but that doesn't really happen here -- it just sounds like straight pop to my ear."
2,Venanda Lovely Boys are not as lovely as i expected,I bought Bo-Tata becauze of the albummz wiked name and the ardist's kool name. Do not b schooled and foold likk I wuz. Bo-Tata should be kalled Bo-KAKA. Get it! HAHAHA. It was a stuupid CD. The songs alwasys soun the sam. Donot wast ur mony.
2,I was dissapointed,"I hate to be the only person to review this book, but I have to tell you that I don't believe this book is worth the price. Maybe I'm not enough of an ""Expert"" to get use from this book, or maybe the topics that I am most interested in, file transfer and printer sessions, just aren't part of this writer's interests. I was expecting some in-depth discussion on file transfer protocals and FDF files in particular, but out of the entire 433 pages, the author devoted one and a half pages to transferring files from the Sys/36 environment, 2 pages to converting CCSID 65535 and 1/2 page to remote email transfers. It's really tough to set up an FDF when attempting to transfer files from a spreadsheet and this book doesn't even address that issue.I will probably keep this book for future reference, but if I had known what wasn't in it, I would have passed on this one."
4,Real Yiddish,Bought one for me and one as a gift to give. It is fun and laid out well. I liked it also for the price.
1,Drek is drek,Not well written and hardly anything new. Printed on poor stock and not very attractive.
4,sheer enjoyment,"the phonetic spellings help enormously, and i found myself sounding out familiar phrases from my childhood. a treasure of ethnic communication to be protected and savored"
2,Just okay.,"The book is okay, but missing contextual meaning. I bought it to refresh my memory of words and expressions since I don't hear it used very often."
4,Excellent Holmes!,"Great story.I wish the offering had had subtitles, but nevertheless, it was excellent. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the old Holmes' movies."
2,Pictures are confusing for my 3.5 years old,"I ordered this book after I read about the good reviews. But I am disappointed. I do not really care what kind of methods (one or two loops) the book shows as long as my son can tie his shoes. But the pictures are really confusing for a 3.5 years old. The max he can do is to put the red lace over the yellow lace and tie the first knot. When it comes to the loops, he is totally lost. Hopefully it will work for an older kid. As for the wordings in the book, which the reader supposed to memorize and be able to tie his shoes later on, are not even rhyme."
2,"lace is not ancored, strangulation hazard!","Otherwise a great book. However we were given it when my older child was about 4; very soon he pulled the lace out and tried to harness his baby brother over the neck :-0. I took the book away and misplaced it - so now will have to order another one and ancor the lace ourselves. I'd sew through the cardboard, tape is bound to come off when you least expect it. Hopefully they will improve in the next edition."
2,Wierd way to tie a shoelace! We're still in velcro shoes.,"I was recommend this book at Stride Rite to teach my child to tie her shoelaces. Well, it instructs a child to make two loops and then twist them into a bow. Well, that is hard to do with adult hands- much less with kid hands. Holding one loop together while you gather up the other string into a loop is tough for a new learner. I would suggest just coming up with your own riddle to teach your child. Wasn't what I had hoped for."
2,Not the best.,It is not the best. It is actually confusing to me....We really don't use the book because it is confusing. We had to relace the book because they had the colors backwards and then they try to explain how to tie your shoes by making two bows at first then tieing the bows together.
1,Did not work!,Book did not help at all. The way it was shown was backwards and did not help. Even when I tried it didn't work.
3,"only teaches ""bunny ears"" method","My son already knew how to do bunny ears - I thought this would teach him the other way. The problem with the bunny ears method is that kids don't get the shoes tight enough. So this was good in that it gave him the confidence to tie his own shoes, however he still needs a lot of help to get them tight. The kids have since knotted the laces up completely."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL,This was a wonderful investment. I purchased this book for my son on my way home from work and we began practicing that night. By the next evening he wanted to tie everyone's shoes. I would definately recommend buying this book.
2,I should have listened,"I did not place much weight on the reviews that criticized the two loop method. That is not the way I tie my shoes, but I figured well we all do it somehow. My child wants to learn but doesn't like seeing someone able to do it when she can't. I thought the book would be perfect, because she could take it off to a corner and practice at her own pace. She is 4 1/2 and has expressed an interest in learning. While the book initially built excitement for her, she has now lost interest because she is finding it so frustrating. She wants to do it just as the book, but some of the pictures are hard for her to follow. I tried doing the two loop method and I found it very tough to do. Frankly I think it takes more finger dexterity than the other way. She accidentally did it the other way once and had success but now refuses to learn the other way because ""the book says..."" At the same time she is now too frustrated to use the book. It is sturdy and a great idea overall."
4,"Excellent book, it did the trick","My 4 year old practiced with this for 3 of 4 days and can now tie his shoes! After trying everything to teach him to tie his shoes, he's finally got it down. Not only does he tie his, he randomly comes up to me and unties mine just to retie them. Cute"
5,It did the trick...,"After spending a few months trying to teach my then four year old how to tie her shoes (and succeeding only in frustrating her), her babysitter gave her this book as a gift. Within a week or two, she was tying her shoes perfectly! I like the books construction (it's a board book) and the model shoe and illustrations that teach shoe tying with a little catchy poem. The shoe model at the bottom of the book has one lace in it that is red on one end and yellow on the other and the different colors makes shoe tying easier for beginners. This book is now my ""standard"" gift to children turning four."
5,"Great book, but dangerous for young toddlers","The book is a wonderful book, but the lace is not anchored to the book. Your toddler can pull it out and wrap it around his or her neck. Make sure you anchor it to the book (with glue or tape on the back)"
3,Shoetying,"The strings are a little too long, but this is an effective tool for teaching shoetying. My son is still mastering this skill."
3,cute but not exciting,"My child became frustrated and BORED with all the words in the book. Cute rhymes in book but made me as a parent confused on tying shoes just by looking at diagrams. Even I became inpatient just reading the long lengthy book. It is good for kids who like to learn from books and pictures, not active ones who learn by actual practice."
3,Lots of reviewers missing the point,"The thing most of the reviews seem to be missing is that this was written in 1995 (when Linux didn't even -function-) and OSS was in reality, barely off the ground. Most reviews carp about how this os/book is a ""no show"" - that's not really the point. It shows all of the bits necessary to write an OS from scratch.Apparently, few of the readers have actually worked in industry."
5,What you need to Consider,"There is something that one needs to consider before purchasing a book of this type: for what platform was it designed. This particular book is an excellent and comprehensive guide to creating your own 32-bit operating system. The catch is the 32 bit part. The operating system which one is taught to build will be designed to run on the 386 and 486 platforms. These systems are not as widely used today as they once were. Today's platform is the 64-bit, which was virtually unheard of in the 1980's to early 90's when this book was written. This book does teach you the basics, and will whet your appetite to program better things. For this, I highly recommend the book."
1,No CD with the book,Why this is no CD along with the book. Please send me the content on the CD. I need it
2,"I need a copy, wanna sell... let me know at maus@home.nl","It's a great book -it's gonna be a classic- for every programmer interrested in O.S.'s and writing them. Unfortunately I don't own it. Do you, contact me at maus@home.nl so we can agree a price. Thank you so much. =]"
2,LLLOOOOONNNGGG n hard to get into,OMG i wish i had been warned! this book starts off SLOW and BORING! couldnt get passed the first 30 pages.
1,"If your a history buff enjoy, if not I wouldn't recomend it",The book was really well written but I am not one for historical fiction of this nature. I myself prefer complex suspensefuil plots. This books is very clearly organized. I can see how other poepl might have enjoyed it but I really condsidered it boring. So history buffs prepare for a treat. Everyone else eliminate all distractions if you really want to fininsh this book.
1,This book is only suited for black history buffs.,"Jubilee focuses on the life of Vyry, a daughter of a white plantation owner and a black slave. This book is very dull, dry, and poorly written. Take by advice, and read Beloved by Toni Morrison instead."
5,"So well written, I felt as if I was Vyry.","Best book I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone, young and old. I am so glad my dad named me after such an intelligent and strong black women.Vyry Marie Herrington"
3,You can judge this book by the cover,"This book is a pocket guide and lives up to the name. Everything is summarized and made simple. Sometimes the simplicity leads to confusion, but the guide acts as a reference to solve the problem by finding another source. Overall, by itself the guide is okay, but utilized with other manuals, it is a great tool."
5,This man is a genius.,"Thank you Amazon! After reading Mr. Jarman's 'Poisonous Quotes' book, I raced out for this one. My family are big golfers. Lo and behold, the bookstore had sold out. Thank goodness it was available with Amazon. I understand he has a book on Ryder Cup History to be released soon. Can hardly wait!"
3,Loud,"This is a simple filtration unit. It uses a single-stage 3M filtrate 1000 filter. The filter is easily replaced. The filter rating of 1000 implies that it is not good for removing very fine particles (i.e. pet dander). I run the unit 24 hours a day at the second highest setting. It is most effective at it's highest setting, but at it's highest setting it is extremely loud. Instead of getting one of these ... if you have central A/C and allergies, get a 3M Filtrete rated at 2200. It is a better overall solution."
4,Cleaner Air,The air purifier does a decent job. My allergies seem to be better for the most part. What I didn't like was the smell it gave off when I first bought it. It took a few months for the odor to go away.
4,A Pretty Good Air Filter,Works well. Not silent yet not loud. It definitely helps keep some of the cat's hair off of the floor.
3,Real cost is in the filters,"This device works well, but the filters need to be replaced often because they have shallow pleats and no prefilter. If you can find an air purifier with a washable filter, buy it. The replacements filters for this one can run up to $20 apiece. They probably cost the company $0.25 each to manufacture and ship. And good luck getting a replacement filter from the hardware store- I've looked, and while they have about 100 types of 3M filters, none of the local or chain stores I visited had them.I bought this device new from Woot.com two years ago for $20, and at the time there was a $20 rebate. I can't believe the same machine costs more than $100 here. It's a fan enclosed by plastic.3M - why are you so greedy?"
2,"Very pleased, but...","Having purchased many air purifiers over the years, this one (FAP02) has been the best! I also have the larger FAP03 purifier and am pleased with its performance too, though it's rather large. They work so well that the filter only lasts 1 to 3 months, and I love that each unit tells you when the filter is restricted, but don't chg the filter immediately; try vaccuming the filter first to extend the filter life. Also, rotate the filter, since the bottom of the filter fills up first.HERE'S THE PROBLEM: the replacement filters are TOO expensive!!! Between the cost of the unit, plus replacement filters with shipping, you should consider the true cost before purchasing this unit."
4,a little sweet,I love John West products and these are also great although I find these specific herring a little on the sweet side for my liking.
3,Boots not what you see,"I ordered these boots because they say they are 12"" but they are really 10"". They are also made from thin leather."
2,beautiful Unicorns,Alot of the unicorns enter a beauty pageant but flower-child Mandy Miller is against it(as if it is a terrible thing to be a pretty girl!).This is a copy of Miss Teen Sweet Valley.You will enjoy it if you like the Unicorn Club.
2,"African ""Dynasty"" sans Joan","How can I write a book about a bunch of shallow, avaristic, name-dropping money-grubbers and make them appear to be heroic and noble? Let's set it in Africa and draw it out so boringly and lenghtily that the reader will completely loose interest in it after 25 pages. Let's also make it totally implausible and drop every advertiser's name in the affluent world of priviledge like Cartier and Bentley... Well, you get the picture. After the glorious Monsoon and River God, this broke my heart."
3,Spelling mistakes!,"Great book, I would recommend the story to anyone, but this Kindle version is absolutely riddled with spelling issues and repeated lines of text. I can't rate the product any higher because of this. I haven't had any trouble with my Kindle and I absolutely love it, but this issue was extremely disappointing. You might want to think about redoing this book."
5,Golden Fox,Up to the good standards of Wilbur Smith. I thouroughly enjoyed every page I read. A must read for wilbur smith fans.
2,Wilbur Smith's worst,"After enjoying the saga of the Courtneys, I found Golden Fox to be entirely out of character. It had all the appeal, and sadly the dialogue and story line of a poor romance novel. Frankly I couldn't finish it, preferring to leave the Courtneys as they were after A Time To Die. An extremely poor finish to a good series."
4,my review,"A KGB officer, born in Spain but educated in Cuba, sets up a South African woman to become her spy against her will. The tool he uses is against all human decency....Once again Wilbut Smith has written an excellent novel. The plot keeps the reader hooked until the very end and you can never guess what the outcome will be. The characters are incredibly real. The writing is excellent and the description of every scene makes you feel as if you were present in the room!This is a very good novel and a very entertaining read!"
4,A good story of treachery at high levels,A well written book showing the evils of treason and the ways peopled are manoeuvred into betraying their family and country
4,Pretty Good.,"This is the only Band i know of that features Death Metal and Spanish music (Other than Mr.Bungle) It is Very Good and I can't Wait to Get Nuclear.sad.Nuclear.1.""Imagine Nation Express""-This is a Real Heavy track it is the only song to have A Chorus It Mixes Ska Punk With Death metal2.""the Pinata of death""-Extremly heavy with a Bit of Clean Vocals3.""Jay Walking Backwards""-Amazing Simply Amazing only Soft song on the album and it incorporates Much Melody and Clean Vocals4.""Grandfather""-Spanish music/Ska+Death metal5.""Alright...""-No Beat or Melody But what do expect?6.""Paper Weight Pigs""-I always get this one mixed up with aright because it sounds exactly the same.7.""Sleeping with the fishes,See?""-Sounds like another Grindcore Track But it incorporates Melody in the end8.""Cradle in the Crater""-Spainsh Music/Grindcore = Melody9.""the Weekly wars""-Lots of singing here and alot of melody10.""The Try""-I Wasn't expecting this"
1,GOD,"this cd SUCKS. i was really expecting a lot, i love nuclear. sad. nuclear., but this is just not good at all. their slightly annoying vocalist stayed, and the awesome guitar left. wtf?"
3,Enjoyable,"Pablo Neruda is always an interesting read, and quality of this book, as well as his poetry, is very high."
3,May need to be rerouted,May need to be rerouted a little shorter but at one third of cost Canadian is a excellent buy recommend as very hard to reproduce as components not available.
3,Working 2nd Bear Amazing!,"Bought this as a gift for my Mum who grew up listening to the radio show and had very fond memories. She loved the bear which sits well in her collection, but the music box never worked on the first one. I was able to return it without any trouble and had a second one shipped. The new one works great and it is SO soft and wonderful the bear is actually even better looking than the picture shows. The music box sounds wonderful and moved my Mum who received it to tears. Thank you."
4,"Cool movie, but more suspense thriller than horror.","Two high school parents are killed in a car accident, and the teens are sent to live with their aunt and uncle in Florida. Soon after they start at their new school, the sister, Abby, becomes the target of five redneck bullies, led by James Spader, who pressure her to go out with them, making bets about which of them will sleep with her first. After she refuses their advances, and her brother Loren comes to her defense, they begin to terrorise the teens, scratching up the family car and vandolizing the famly's home built amusement park. Soon there is a feud building between the siblings and the gang, and eventually it builds to a climax. This film has memerable charecters and a decent amount of suspense, and is definetly worth watching."
4,Good movie,I liked this movie since I was a kid. Teachesyou about bullies and how to protect yourselfGave it to my sister.
2,New kids on a rampage,"No matter the title, ""The New Kids"" for the U.S.A., or""Striking Back"" for the U.K. and the rest of the world,this is an outstanding very rare and uncutSean S. Cunningham movie on DVD.Letterboxed quality for a 24 years old movie is okaybut where is the bonus material ...?"
4,Filmed at my High School,"This movie was huge in Homestead, FL where it was filmed--who knew it had any other sort of following outside of our town? It is truly an 80's movie, truly a ""B"" movie, and truly entertaining if you are into these types of flicks!"
3,Fun but not outstanding,"I enjoyed this movie but don't consider it to be a 5/5 level experience. Positives: True music aficionados will undoubtedly enjoy all the cameos; the production values are surprisingly high and the acting is generally quite good; it features the girl from Hot Tub Time Machine who had a memorable hot tub crying scene; its witty - good dialogue with enough humor sprinkled in throughout; some very creative and artistic scenes (camera work, use of lighting, use of limited sfx, etc.). On the negative side, I found the story to be a bit slow and lacking engaging elements. While it was certainly fun, its just not that memorable; the story proceeds without any particular punch or substantial conflict. Again, please understand that I enjoyed this film, but its important to understand that its may not necessarily qualify as a 5/5 on everyone's scale. Definitely recommended as a rental, but be duly advised on a purchase decision."
4,This movie doesn't SUCK,"I borrowed this movie from my local library for a Halloween movie night, and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was.Its a fun, campy movie about a horrible rock band that goes vamp (and one overworked, loyal roadie). Throw in some famous rock star cameos, a creepy semi-master vampire, Malcolm McDowell as a hilariously awful vampire hunter, and MMMmmmmm...delicious groupies, and you've got a great movie."
3,"Doesnt SUCK, but...","...it also lacks bite. No pun intended. Nice comedy about an unsuccessful band on the road becoming vamps along the way and also (or because of it) famous. sometimes silly, often not and much too seldom (if ever) hilarious (Rush's Alex Lifeson or Moby as Metal-Singer!!!). Its these cameos (plus the ones of Henry Rollins or Iggy Popp or Alice Cooper) that make a viewing worthwhile. Nothing more, nothing less..."
5,perhaps the very best movie ever made,"i ordered it on net flix then had to own it, it has a great story and a deep complexity that is delivered lightly and with briliant acting by the likes of Alice Cooper, Iggy Pop and Rollins! HUZZAH!"
5,I LOVE this movie,"A tongue-in-cheek horror flick with rock stars and a great style. It's a cleaver, fun, popcorn flick that has more in common with ""Galaxy Quest"" than ""Vampires Suck"" or any other similar lame spoof film. The music's awesome, the acting's great, the rock stars hold their own... especially Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop. I really don't have anything bad to say about this film. If you like rock music and enjoy fun popcorn flicks then this is your movie!"
1,Suck(s),"Don't waste your money. This movie Sucks. Iggy and Alice, are about the only redeeming qualities here. The only way this will ever be a cult classic, is if you are in a cult and your leader forces you to watch it."
1,WOW a movie that lives up to its name,"This is supposed to be funny? Talk about a slow burn that never followed thru. Horrible effects. Horrible script. Horrible jokes. Horrible movie. Where was the good music? Wasnt in the version I saw. Pathetic ""Oh lets recreate famous album covers"" and was Moby supposed to be a take on GG Allin?This movie can eat dix. Avoid. Dont read the ""hype"" over this flick being great or good.This movie doesnt just SUCK it bites."
1,Directions are AWFUL,Ordered this based on the product name. The directions are horrendous and make no sense. It is cheaply made and I had to rig it up in order to have the basket sit on the side of the pan as they said.. I would NOT recommend this item!!
1,Don't be confused this is not the professional version,When using this product it is not like the professional machine used in Spas and doctors offices. It is used to exfoliate and that is all. Don't be confused with power of the machine. It does not have a plug that gives it the amps needed to remove layers of skin. It will not help in the production of collagen. Crissie
2,People Cannot be This Dumb!,"I found the premise of this book totally unbelievable! Two brothers go off to war, one comes back, the other presumed dead. No problem so far. Dead brother is not dead, but still alive. When he reenters the picture (under a new name/identity) no one recognizes him for who he is/was. They merely think he bears a strong resemblance to the man they all knew and loved. Yeah right. I don't buy it. Especially with Flora, the woman who loved Dex. If I ran into an old boyfriend from high school, I'd still be able to recognize him today, even if he changed his name!This was the first book I read by this author. I certainly hope her other works are better."
2,don't buy it,"Bought it, used it, it stopped, exchanged it, it stopped also. I give up and am buying something else."
1,Maybe if it would have worked I would have liked it,"I was on a road trip pulling out my new portable CD player for the first time. I slipped in a Dave Matthews Cd, listened to the first thirty seconds, and suddenly the music stopped. It wasn't a problem with the earphones (even though you must know that the earphones were to most uncomfortable earphones I've ever worn), it was something within the player. And now I don't even know if I can return it for a new one. It really made me mad. I would suggest buying your electronic equiptment from a store, then if you have a questions or a problem, you can easily talk to someone about an alternative"
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this CD player today, and I really liked the color and design. It also sounded great, but the only thing I didn't like was the headphones- they were flimsy. I like to have comfortable, well-fitting headphones when I listen to my music. Otherwise they were fine and also looked cool and were ice-blue that matched the player. This portable CD player is great for the price, but I give it a 3 because I am disappointed with the headphones."
1,poor quality cd player,"Used this item in my car (briefly). It stopped working after falling from my seat to the floor. I would recommend a more robust cd player, especially if you plan on travelling with it."
2,"Cool looks, doesnt work tho...","I bought this same CD player a couple of years ago but I found out that was a big mistake. It started out working really well, and i thought all the negative reviews were wrong. Then after about a week the headphones just snapped as i went to put them on... That's not too big a deal cuz I had others, but about a week later all the buttons got messed up. For example the FF RW buttons switched jobs and so did others. It was really confusing and made it impossible to do anything other than just let the CD play, altho it somehow got put in a random order and the thing to stop that broke. A couple days later, the thing just quit. I tried new batteries but they didnt help. I never dropped it or anything... If u can cough up 15 more dollars buy the cool Cd, CD-R, CD-RW, mp3 thing the have on the site."
1,"..., nice, troublesome","I chose this CD player because of its great prize but.. It can not be stopped playing now! A STOP button thinks it is ""move back"" and FF button works as ""modes"". More, it eat batteries quickly, eg Philips LongLife in 2 hours. And don't try jogging with it.. Nevertheless, its design is so cool."
2,fun...while it lasted,"Admittedly, I only bought this player because it was purple, but I am still sorely dissapointed in it's performance. I started having minor problems with it after about six months of moderate use. The sound quality has been degrading steadily, and as of today, the player is completely unusable. It skips every couple of seconds, even with a new disc on a flat, still surface. The anti-skip function actually makes it worse! It has been less than a year since the date of purchase.Still, it is awfully cute. And for a few weeks there, I was reccomending it to everyone. If you aren't in it for the long haul, go ahead and buy this. If you want something more durable, keep shopping."
2,Ok unless you want it over 6 months,"I got this cd player for my birthday and i loved it. it looked really cool. i put my cd in and clicked on the anti skip button and it was pretty good. it skipped a little bit but not enough to be disappointed in. i did a lot of things with this cd player. i mowed with it and took it every where i went. But the first problem was that it ate up the batteries pretty quick. so if i wanted to take it somewhere i would have to take extra batteries. and also it didnt tell you how much power is left in my batteries until they totally run out. also when i mowed it would constantly skip and would really get annoying. and then after about 6 months of having it, it just stopped working. i was very mad. we had to throw it away. so if you enjoy buying a new cd player every 6 months you should get this one."
1,Don't Buy This Product...Check the Bad Reviews!!,"I bought this CD player for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas and now after a months use, it no longer plays music! The Koss website does not have any support for their CD products and so any thought of returning this product is forgotten. I read all the great reviews for this product here and decided to purchase the CD player, but I am urging you not to buy it. The bad reviews are very valid!"
4,Niles,"I have prior expeirience with several products. I started with a sony cd player 5 years ago that had no skip protection. i went to aiwa shortly later that had none either. after a while i stumpled upon a cd player with 10 sec skip protect. the cd player worked great, and skip protection protected for a max of about 6 seconds. and this was another sony! this koss cdplayer, which i bought a few weeks ago, has shock protection that lasts up to 30 seconds, and even is somewhat shock proof without the skip proof on. i dont know what these people are talking about, this cd player looks great, sounds great (awesome bass!) and the shock protection works better than even a 100 dollar sony i bought earlier! i recommend this for anyone who wants to get great sound for less money."
4,"Good, But Missing Features","This CD player has a great weight and feel to it, and it look awsome to. It plays CD's super and has a very crisp sound. I got this to replace my Sony Discman, and with the replacement, There are some missing features that are hard to live without. This CD Player doesnt have a ""resume"" function that allows you to pick up off the place on the CD where you left off, and the biggest missing feature is a Battery Indicator, so you have absolutly no idea what condition your batteries are in. I will now be forced to take an extra pair of batteries with me wherever I go in case they go dead on me. But overall, its worth the money, and a good CD player! You can always trust Koss"
3,Cool CD player!,"This CD player only worked for a few months. It was really cool while it lasted, though! Don't let this discourage you from buying it though. It was a good price and overall a pretty good buy!"
1,"Please, please do NOT buy! If you do, I feel SORRY for you!","The ONLY good thing about this CD player is the way it looks! The sound is so fuzzy. After a couple minutes of play, it starts making a really high-pitched sound like DE-DEEE-BE-NI-FII-DEEE! The headphones ALWAYS FALL OFF YOR HEAD, and you have to be Arnold S. to press the buttons! I am not kidding. But, if you like the sound of this CD player, go ahead and buy it. But, you'll regret it...majorly! Thank you for reading my review."
3,Fantastic CD player,"It's just a shame the headphones broke after 8 days. Didn't expect much more though. Of course, headphones are not covered in the guarantee."
3,Decent,"seems to be very sensitive to tiny nicks or scratches on cds. My cds which play perfectly fine in my home stereo or car skip constantly, making it a little annoying. In general, though, a good player."
3,Not thrilled with it,"I bought this CD player for my daughter for her birthday. Within the first week the headphones broke and I had to crazy glue it back together!!!! Even so, she still uses it all the time. The sound is good for the price, and it looks cool!!!! That's whats important when you're twelve!!!!!!!"
4,Easy and fun to use,"I bought this cd player about 8 months ago, and I've never looked back. Great sound, easy to use. It's pretty good at not skipping even when the anti-skip is turned off. Sure I've dropped it a few times, accidentally - no problems caused by that at all. The only problem I have with it is that lately when I hit the button to try to get to the next track, instead of advancing, each press of the button cycles through the modes! I figure it's because the ""mode"" button is right next to it, and I use it A LOT. However, I plan to replace it with the same CD player because I love it so! If you're going to buy a CD player - make it this one!"
3,"For the price, it's good, but that's about it.","Pro: -The skip protection is VERY good. 40 seconds and it holds up very well. -The button layout looks funny, but is very functional. -Seeing the CD spin through the plastic is very cool. -LCD layout is medium size, functional, and easily viewed.Con: -Feels cheap. Cheap plastic, very cheap headphones. -Skip protection buffer gets emptied when you pause, fast forward, or rewind. -Sound quality is very bland lacking dynamics.Conclusion: If you want a CD player that looks cool, functions well, has very good skip protection, is cheaply made, and don't care about sound quality, then this is the one to get.Koss used to be halfway good, but they are going downhill. (BTW, I returned this one and bought a Sony)"
2,Very Dissapointed,"I bought this CD player for its great price, excellent looks, and its numerous features. I read poor reviews, and dismissed them as rare occurences. I was soooo wrong...When it arrived, it would play for a little while, and then suddenly turn off. Then, the buttons stopped working. I had [...] replace it, and guess what? AFTER 2 WEEKS, THE SECOND ONE BEGAN TO HAVE PROBLEMS TOO! The buttons are all messed up--the stop button skips the track and the skip buttons do random things, and because of this it's almost impossible to turn off. The return period had expired, but it was still covered by Koss Electronics' 90 day warranty. However, I needed a copy of the invoice, AND [...]. So now I'm stuck with it, at least it can just play. The good thing, though, is that this CD player has EXCELLENT sound, and probably the best I have ever heard. I also like the design."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this cd player because it appeared to have the standard options, was a high seller, and had good reviews by other users. The player would begin to emit a static-like sound after about 20 minutes of playing. After about the 3rd use it began to skip and would not stop. This was my first portable cd player and I was very disappointed"
1,KOSS is a terrible CD player,"KOSS is a good bargain if their products actually worked over the long haul. BUT THEY DON'T! Trust me, or you will pay with a couple of 20's and your sanity. I am not the only one, my cousin purchased the same KOSS CD player and one month later he threw it off a 5 story apartment building balcony. It's a piece of crap."
1,Terrible,"Wow, I see since I bought this unit there have been lots of people with the same troubles I had. I will simply add to the chorus of voices who have said:1) Eats batteries like mad.2) Within about a month of buying the unit the buttons stopped working properly. The reverse button advanced tracks, stop would often switch modes, etc. ABSOLUTELY FRUSTRATING3) The anti-skip protection did not work very well. I got nothign like 40 seconds out of the skip protection and this is just holding the unit flat while walking at a moderate pace.I was extremely dissapointed with this player. Mine finally just stoppped working one day..."
1,POS,Its a POS! It broke the 1st week I had it then I returned it and the 2nd one the headphones broke and you can only hear out of one side. I put a new pair on it and it worked but now you can't hear anything! Ive only had it about a year!
2,Great . . . for the short time it lasted,"When I first bought this CD player, it was great. The sound and headphones were excellent and it was really cool looking. It was great for a few months, then it started to just turn off in the middle of playing a CD. To get it to work again, I had to hit it really hard, cause all the buttons stopped working! So as you can see this CD player is not worth the money. If you want a CD player that lasts a few months, this is the one for you. If you want a quality CD player, go with a Panasonic or a Sony."
2,Battery Eater,This CD player eats batteries faster than I can stuff pork rinds into my mouth with both hands. After the first five or six cds it also started skipping every time it was jostled. But hey...it's purple. And that's worth a couple of stars.
5,Koss Asp 40 second Personal Cd player,"Another great product by Koss. All of my cd players are made by this wonderful company. As you can see in the picture it is designed with the fashion loving Electronics enthusiast in mind. This CD player comines affordability, style and quality into a nice blue casing. This is a must have for anyone who wants to listen to their music in style, quality, and value."
1,Needs Quality Control,"From reading the other reviews, I see that the two unreliable points are the anti-skip and the control buttons. In my case, the anti-skip works fine, but the control buttons failed after a few months. Now, sometimes they work, and sometimes not. If I had bought it at a local store, I'd be returning it.The unit also has a crude look to it, not as refined in appearance as the Sonys, for instance. As soon as I opened the box, I was disappointed with the appearance, just not quite up to modern standards."
2,the color is the best thing about this portable cd player,"Skip protection does not work. I cannot wear it and walk on the treadmill at a brisk pace. The buttons do not work reliably either. I can push a button several times before the feature engages. This was a cute color, but performance wise, it's just another piece of junk."
3,Damon Dash dabbles in R&B,"The Roc Music Group Presents: Than Album, Vol. 1 was supposed to be a showcase for up & coming R&B acts on Dash's new label Roc Music Group. Surprisingly the disc isn't filled with cookie cutter R&B and a few of the acts show promise. Stand out tracks include They Don't Believe & I Like by Que. Divine Nature does New Edition justice on their cover of Can You Stand The Rain as Damias Rivera to Stacy Latisaw on her cover of Let Me Be Your Angel. Sadly I doubt if any of the acts will ever release a CD but they do show promise"
3,A sad work,"I have always admired Kiri's voice and artistry... And I bought this CD knowing that I could not expect the creamy voice of 10 years ago... but I was not prepared to hear her in such a bad condition. The music is in the concept of ""Fussion"" (latin-african design) which is too much in fashion this days. Some of the songs are K. Jenkins own compositions. The material in itself is very interesting, but the performance is banal. The worst is Kiri's diction... terrible. when she sings the spanish songs, you know she does not even understand herself... you cannot accept that of an international singer like her. After hearing the CD I was kind of sad..."
3,not for young kids,"This is a decent documentary on an Amazonian rain forest. It shows lots of wildlife and has some interesting footage, particularly of the Harpie Eagle. There is also fairly good footage of sloths, spider monkeys, peccaries, jaguars, howler monkeys, parrots, a taper, and some rodents that aren't in N. America. However, note that part of the theme is predators and prey. There are lots of shots of things getting eaten or dying. In particular, the shots of baby monkeys getting eaten were hard for my 5 year old to take (the 9 yr old was fine however)."
1,"1 pen, not 12.","The description says you get 12 pens, but you only get one. Yes $1.90 is a fair price to pay for 1 pen, but if I had known it was only one I certainly would not have paid $7.46 for them to mail me one pen! Sounds a little too much like a scam to me. The seller was good enough to refund my money after I contacted them, so if you have bought this pen thinking you would get 12, definately contact them and demand a refund. They certainly aren't in any hurry to correct the description as it has been over a month since I bought it and it still says 12 pens.Regarding the pen itself, it is far from perfect. It will occasionally spurt out a large amount of paint onto your work with no warning, making a mess of everything, including your clothes. Other than that, the colors are good and when it doesn't squirt it works pretty good."
2,hurts my ears,"these earrings are too small, smaller than what i thought. they look nice when i put them on but i cant wear them too long because they hurt the back of my ears. waste of money...."
5,REST IN PIECE SIR TONY,"REST IN PIECE SIR TONY, DIRECTOR OF THE LAST BOYSCOUT. HOLLYWOOD HAS LOST A TRUE GENIUS OF A FILMMAKER. SO PROUD TO BE A FAN AND TO OWN ALL HIS FILMS"
4,"Bogart, move over","No guilt involved. A snappy, violent, very fast moving action fest. Full of one-liners, fast editing, and ""tough - guy"" humor. I wouldn't let my children watch this movie, but I like it. Especially late at night when I want explosions, gunfights and not to much intellectual baggage. In my opinion this is one of Bruce's best flicks."
2,Movie is Alright: DVD isn't Alright,"This is a very LOW quality DVD, but DVD's shouldn't be rated solely on the quality of the features and appearance. There is a closed caption for the entire movie, which upsets me. I don't like having to see the wording of the movie being written as it is said.Now to the movie. It's very good except for a few insanely pointless scenes. It is funny on several occasions and vulgar on all occasions."
3,Satan Claus is out there and we need more boy scouts,"This movie is a cross between Die Hard and Willis' David Addison of Moonlighting fame: violent, wise-cracking, slapstick and football - what more could a guy want. It is, however, over the top with more cursing than necessary, but believe it or not the chemistry works between Willis and Wayans. I was hoping it might spawn a sequel or two given that Willis at the end of the film asks Wayans to join him as a partner in his detective business. Perhaps the box office take just wasn't there. Lots of comedians in this film. Wayans comical, but in a more serious role, Rick Ducommon as the guy with the car in his pool and Taylor Negron steals this movie as the oh so seriously deadly Milo. Chelsea Field hasn't much of a part, but this movie does seem to have a low opinion of women. Also, despite her unnecessarily foul mouth Danielle Harris as Darian is charming despite that preoccupation. If you blink or go to the fridge you'll miss Halle Berry."
1,"A big, loud, stupid piece of garbage","The Last Boy Scout is the kind of movie indie fans point to when they bemoan the lack of quality in Hollywood films. It's a gratuitously violent, utterly offensive and sexist pile of trash that shows why Tony Scott should not be allowed to direct another film for the rest of his life (when Top Gun is the finest film you've ever done, it says volumes about your talent or lack thereof). Bruce Willis does his usual tough guy routine, Damon Wayans shows his usual bad taste in picking projects and the whole sordid mess reeks of idiocy from top to bottom. If you like foul mouthed kids, women portrayed as either philanderers or crackheads, lots of car crashes, lots of things blowing up and bodies flying around and tons and tons of gratuitous foul language with no intelligent dialogue to go along with it, then The Last Boy Scout is for you. If, however, you have even a little bit of taste, stay as far away from this clinker as you can."
5,The Last Boy Scout is great.,This was a great movie. It is a favorite of mine and my friends. It has a great plot and great actors. The movie is an instant classic. I give it 5 stars. I hope you like this movie too.
5,the last boy scout,a great action pack 80's early 90's movie doesnt make movies like these anymore.damon waynes and bruce willis great tag team together and halle berry is so fine even though she only had a few parts in the movie.
3,Guilty Pleasure,"I have to admit, this is one of my guilty pleasures of ""filmmaking."" Bruce Willis plays a down-on-his-luck PI (Who can do ""down-on-his-luck"" better than Bruce?) who is given a surveilance job by his partner-who incidentaly is having an affair with Willis's estranged wife. His job: to protect a stripper (Halle Berry) who is the boyfriend of ex-football hero Damon Wayans. When Halle turns up dead, the plot thickens, teaming Willis and Damon up to find the killers. It turns out that the ""Killers"" are a powerful footbal owner who is trying to blackmail the California governor into legalizing pro-football gambling. Again this is your basic buddy-buddy action-comedy, but Willis and Damon's chemistry make it worthwhile."
5,Good dvd,Good dvd. I loved this movie. Glad I could get the dvd after so many years of looking.Happy new year.
1,Love the movie but the quality of the DVD sucks!,We bought this to replace an old VHS version. The quality of this DVD was horrible....not any better than the old VHS. We've replaced numerous VHS movies with DVD's and on the other's the quality was great but on this one apparently the producer of this one decided to not bother to enchance the video....truly disappointed and not worth the money.
3,Awesome Movie - Poor Format,"I love The Last Boy Scout, but the version they are using here is not widescreen, which makes for a poor viewing experience on your laptop.Best suggestion is to watch it on an iPad which fits the ratio better.Hopefully they will fix this if they can."
4,"Formulaic, but a good formula","Willis has made this movie again and again: a wise-cracking detective/cop/some-such, seemingly headed straight for the bottom, stops the badguys at the last minute and with body count approaching the national debt. Oh, and partway through, a carefully engineered misunderstanding makes sure the cops are after him, too.The thing it, this recipe keeps working. It serves up action at (or just past) the limits of plausibility, with a few memorable stunts and bits of staging. Halle Barry's brief role near the beginning just sweetens the mix.The wise-cracking remains funny, the badguys are easy to hate, and the final redemption comes through as suitably redeeming. Oh, and the kid is cute, too, even if slightly scary as a knockoff of her father. Great for a rainy Saturday.-- wiredweird"
4,The only Tony Scott film worth bothering with...,"I generally don't like Tony Scott's work, but I did like this film. Bruce Willis plays another smart a** character here, but Bruce's schtick was still fresh at the time, so it still works. Damon Wayans is very good as his sidekick. Aside from a grueling, cringe inducing opening scene (a takeoff on Hank Williams, Jr.'s Monday Night Football song, which is also cringe inducing), the film is filled with very violent action, great one liners, a good sense of humour, a decent story, and a great scene where you see a wide receiver pull a gun (NFL players, don't get any ideas). The film has no depth or substance, but I have to admit I liked it. This is the only Tony Scott film I really like."
3,this is a terrific mix of actoin and comedy,this movie takes two of todays more popular actors and throws them into a movie perfectly written.
4,A Window to the Past,"Nonna is Domenica Maria D'Amore, the author's maternal grandmother and matriarch of a large Italian family. In the opening chapter, she is described as a woman of customs and traditions, one who pushed the limits of kindness to include thoughtfulness, consideration, concern, gentleness, respectfulness, politeness, and more. In the final chapter, reflecting on Nonna's death from cancer at age 58, Iezzi proclaims her to be one of the most important people in his life. A composition he wrote at that time called her ""the best grandmother and the smartest storyteller in the whole world"" who knew ""everything in life and knew the stories of all the great people and saints that ever lived in the world."" The intervening chapters are filled with anecdotes involving a variety of events and individuals that provide insight into this family as well as an earlier culture."
3,A Different Type of Story,"These stories are more personal anectdotes about the author's family than stories revealing faith teaching or morals. Our children still enjoy hearing about Nonna and Vinzee and there are still lessons to be learned, but the chapters are not as succinct and pithy as the first 'Coffee With Nonna'."
2,Waste of time.,"Looked forward to reading this, but not so interesting after all. Read the 1st couple of chapters hoping to eventually enjoy it, but no such luck. Never finished it. My sister had the same reaction."
2,Not what I expected - a little too religious,"After reading the description of this book, I thought there would be more stories about growing up in an Italian household with an Italian Nonna. Instead, every word Nonna says has a religious connotation. It was disappointing."
4,correcting Genre,"At times when music is reviewed we as ""public"" reviewers tend to forget what genre music we are reviewing or perhaps are expecting something else to be heard from what we are listening to. Such is a dilemma with ""smooth ""Jazz. Labelled as Jazz could be a misnomer, in which lies the dilemma. But saying that, on the other hand there are varying levels or styles of "" Jazz"" and this type of music that Mr. Obiedo offers definitely falls into the smooth Jazz category, as it so is called. Nothing more, nothing less. So it is unfair to give a poor rating on an artist`s work after listening expecting to hear something which the artist in question is not the style he/she is presenting, or maybe what the artist wants to present to his buying fans. Ray Obiedo presents Latin influenced smooth Jazz. Just nice rhythmic, mostly instrumental, melodious, tuneful, at times subdued ""Jazz"" music. Which if your a Smooth Jazz listener you should enjoy."
4,Great lens,This is a great lens and the IS feature makes a HUGE difference in the quality of pictures without the use of a tripod.I take many pictures of sporting events for my four kids and my neices and nephews. I am very happy not to have to drag my tripod along. I do use the battery extention on my camera so I get a little longer battery life while using this lens. With the IS feature on it tends to drain your battery life quickly.
4,Pretty good lens,"I have owned this lens for over a year now. I owned the 75-300 IS USM before this and was satisfied with it. I have taken some great pictures with this lens. Having never owned an 'L' lens, I do not have too many issues with the construction. However, picture quality is not exceptional, it is good. With decent light, especially 5.6 and up, it really shines. The IS is a must have for the focal length this lens covers."
5,"DSLR Newbie... First lens, but LOVE IT!!!","I bought this lens to add on to my Canon 40D package that I purchased. I absolutely LOVE this lens!!! However, I am new to the DSLR world so take my opinion for what its worth. :)"
5,Very good lens,"I have used this lens on 5D mark III. It is really good. Quick and precise focus, sharp image, efficient IS."
5,great lens,I am a novice and this lens works great and is very easy to use. The price point seems to be in line.
2,A Solid Lens with drawbacks,"This was one of my first lens purchases. I initially enjoyed it however as I became more and more serious about photography I found that this lens was not producing the quality I was looking for. For one, the chromatic abberation at the long end was terrible when the image was viewed at 100%. Secondly, when shooting wide open, the images are soft although stopping down a stop or two corrects this. I ended up trading this lens in towards the purchase of an EF 70-200 f/4L IS USM lens.This lens, however, is not a complete loss. The 3-stop IS is fantastic and the focusing is relatively fast and accurate. I would suggest people just starting out on a tight budget purchase this lens if the higher end lenses are simply out of reach especially if you don't plan on making outlandishly huge prints from your photos. That said, if I had to relive this purchase, I would have held out for a lens with a higher resale value and higher quality."
2,Less than satisfactory,"I am very disappointed with the performance of this lens. I expected better from Canon since I am a long-time Canon user and have many lenses by them. Images are soft to semi-sharp at all focal lengths. 300mm is never sharp. When enlarged even 25% all images go very soft and become noisy and would be useless for printing. I get much better results with all my other Canon lenses. For the price of this lens I expected much better. My son has a cheaper canon telephoto and gets better images. Looking at the reviews others have written on Amazon, it may be that this particular lens has an inherent optics flaw. The IS works fine in both settings, but the images are still not crisp."
4,Reasonably sharp pictures - especially for the price,"At 300mm, this lens produced much sharper images for me than the EF 100-300mm zoom lens. The image stabilizer (IS) allowed good handheld photos at much slower shutter speeds - had to use 1/800sec previously. With IS, I can now use 1/200sec.Would like to have full time manual focus override but so far only needed it once when the autofocus was temporarily confused because I had not pointed at a contrasty area before pressing the shutter button.Using it on a 1.6 crop factor camera with very satisfactory results."
4,Love the lens!,"After 3 months of research, going between the EF 70-200 f4, the EF 70-200 f4 IS and the EF 70-300 IS I bought the 70-300 and can say I'm very pleased. The IS is awesome, you can actually see the frame stabilize as the IS kicks in. I tried out the 70-200 but I just couldn't get the shots handheld that I could with the 70-300 IS. I actually considered the 70-200 IS but once I played with it I thought ""do I really want to lug this around on my travels?"". The answer was no.I uploaded a couple of photos...one of a white swan I took at our marina and one of my nephew. By the way, I'm new to photography."
4,"Good, not great lens..","I bought this lens about 2 years ago and have taken some great, sharp shots with it. The IS is excellent in both modes. I'm glad it has the zoom lock because without it the lens will flop out. Since buying this lens I have added some L's to my lineup and have gotten a bit spoiled. If I could do it over again, I would buy the 70-200 f/4L IS instead of this lens even though it is white (I hate to stand out). I hate that the 70-300 does not have ring-type USM. It has the micro motor USM that you cannot manual focus unless you flip a switch. If you can swing the price difference and don't mind the shorter focal length, I would recommend getting the 70-200 instead.Update:I just noticed on the description of this lens on Amazon, they claim it has ring-type USM (the better, faster auto focus with full-time manual focus in one shot mode). This is FALSE, it has micro motor USM (slower to auto focus and NO full-time manual focus)."
4,Great lens for price,"Got this to shoot elephant seals on central California coast. Very sharp lens. Construction feels solid. Front of lens rotates during focus which means can't use polarizer during action shots. Wish lens was faster, but that would make it much more expensive."
5,Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens for Canon EOS SLR Cameras from Amazon,I am enjoying the new telephoto lens. It does a great job: I love it.
4,Good,This is a good lense for the price. I only purchased it because I got such a good deal. I would save up and get a bigger and better lense in the future.
5,Great lens,This lens is really that good. Gives crisp clear photos. Easy to use. Another Canon product that does not dissapoint.
5,Crystal Clear Image.,"I love this lens. It brings you right up to the action. It takes an amazing, clear image. The image stabilization works great and has both Mode 1 and 2. The ultrasonic auto focus is super fast and quiet. Well worth the price!"
4,Canon Lens,So far I have really enjoyed the lens and the quality of picture I have been able to take.
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!!!,I am using this lense on a Canon Xsi and it is truely amazing. The pictures are so sharp and clear. I could not be happier with this purchase. It is a lot of money but well worth it. I love it!!!
4,"Good, but big . . .","Takes great pictures -- but, is a beast to lug around. Make sure you have the right type of camera bag before you invest in this. Great image stabilization. I love it!"
1,Watch out when buying a used lens,The product is nice if you can ever get one...Twice I have ordered lens with reasonable used prices.Both times the lens was never shipped. I am beggginging tobelieve that these used sellers are bogus to force thebuyer to pay full cost. Which I have no intention of doing.I'm patient and will now buy on EBay. As a retiree I have allthe time I need to waut to get a lens
4,Len's Review!,"Bought this for my son and sent it to South Korea. He is going on an adventure in the jungles of Borneo, Hiking in Maylasia and finishing his trip with sight seeing in Japan. He said the lens is great for capturing the landscape and the people in each country!"
3,Fair lens,"This lens is fair for what you pay for it but don't expect anywhere near L quality in sharpness, contrast and saturation of colors. As a beginning lens it is useful and the image stabilizer works well. This lens is part of an older generation of lenses designed to compliment the wide angle kit lenses."
5,I'm happy with it,"I bought this lens so that I could capture great shots from a farther distance back and also for taking pictures of the moon. So far I have taken it skiing and took great pictures of my nephew racing down the ski slope and pictures of my family skiing down the slope as well. I also was able to take pictures of snow blowing off of mountain peaks that were a few hundred yards away.Moon shots turned out crisp and with the craters, lines and gray patches showing up clearly. I would recommend this lens for its great quality and reasonable price compared with some of the other higher end lens's out there."
5,Cannon EF 70-300 mm lens,"I am using this lens on my Canon Rebel Digital, and it is well manufactured, very clear with no distortion, light weight, and exhibits smooth operation. Very Happy."
5,Good entry level tele zoom lens,"Use this to photograph baseball and it has never had any issues. Well built, lens that produces sharp images."
5,One of the best lenses out there & a great price.,"I owned this lens for quite a while, sold it, and am going to re-purchase it at this great price. It takes fantastic, sharp pictures in very low light situations (such as at the zoo, in one of the ""houses""), great sports pictures and much more. I have shot super clear, beautiful animal pictures at 1/25th of a second, due to image stabilization. I think at about $460, this lens is a steal. Rather than writing a long, boring review, click here to see just one of the animal pictures that I shot with this lens: http://eyefetch.com/image.aspx?ID=575247"
4,Canon 70-300 lens,"Got the Canon EF 70-300 mm with image stabilizer lens for my Kenya safari. I'm quite satisfied with it and got great pictures of wildlife, but wished I had gotten a more powerful one - something like a 400.The 400 is way out of my budget; and if I had gotten that I would have wished for something even more powerful.Some of my pictures zoomed to the max do not appear to be as focused; not sure if I did not do something right or a shortcoming of the lense itself.The image stabilizer is great; I'll never be able to do without it from now on."
3,Good lens for the price,Good Lens for the price.I;m still to explore all the features.Zoom range is good. IS helps at larger zooms range.
5,A Starter Lens With IS!,"I picked this up with my first 350d, and was very happy with it. I since purchased a whole bevy of lenses and sold this to another happy user:)"
4,"WAY too expensive, but...","WAAAAY too expensive (they all are though) but it gets the job done. A decent lens, but it's definitely NOT an ""all-in-one""... you'll need others to get the job done. The low and high ends are pretty much useless, but the mid-range is good."
4,Love the lens - hate the tax,"The lens meets my expectations. I'm disappointed with picture quality at 300mm, blurry - definately need a tripod.I'm angry about an added charge for New York sales tax. I'm not a resident of NY. Amazon wouldn't ship the item to an APO address (which our federal government declares must be viewed as a US address); so I had it delivered to a family member in NY, then forwarded to me. I was shocked to see the previously undisclosed charge added to my bill."
3,Fuzzy at 300mm,"I purchased this lens for a cruise to Alaska. The lens works great except I had blurred pictures at the 300mm zoom. I was disappointed in the results.I don't know if it is out of focus, or I may have jiggled. I think if I had increased the ISO setting, I might have gotten a faster shutter speed and had eliminated the blur."
4,LOVE it,"We had a set of old speakers that hadn't been used in YEARS, so naturally when we went to use them the foam around the speakers just crumbled. At first we ordered the wrong size, and the only down side is we had to pay shipping 3 times. But now that they are in, the speakers sound as good as new!"
5,Excellent quality and does the job,The cost was just right and it is doing the job it is suppose to do.Would recommend
2,EXTRAORDINARLY difficult to unplug,"At first, this cable worked great; it was fast and sturdy. But when I tried to unplug it, it was nearly impossible. It immediately got stuck in the port. I tried all sorts of online tutorials, using a tweezer or a flathead screwdriver, and when that failed I called around asking for help; I was at my wit's end because I didn't know whether to keep trying lest it damage the Ethernet port itself. Eventually I suceeded, using a tweezer, but still every time I unplug it I must use the tweezer, which is inconvenient because I often bring my laptop on the go. Perhaps the plug goes too deep into the port, making it impossible to push down on the tab with your finger. I would not recommend this cable for people who regularly plug and unplug it."
4,Works As Expected,"This cat5 cable performs exactly as expected. It was ran through 3 walls and an attic and has worked flawlessly. If you need guaranteed high speed performance, then this cable works."
3,Just not breaking through,"Have become a big Beck fan in the last year, with Guero, Sea Change, and Odelay as favorites. Feels like he's marching to his own drummer, which easily separates him from the me-too, over-produced, over-hyped stuff that spews out. However, have to say that this one isn't doing it for me yet. Don't hate it, but it doesn't stand out either. Guero and Sea Change broke new ground. This sounds like producers put his last 10 albums in a blender, hit puree, and spit out the results.Two weeks later: Have to admit that it's growing on me. Differences from previous albums remain subtle, but still good stuff. More production means vocals difficult to ascertain at times, but if you liked his previous work, you'll like this."
2,Just a Little Better than Guero,If another artist put out this album I might have liked it more. But since it is Beck (the expectations being high) I'm being generous with two stars. 1000 beats per second is the worst song ever put out by Beck.All the tracks on this album are redundant and they don't progress. They simply don't have any movement at all. His songs used to be more unpredictable and evolving. These tracks upset me because I love Beck.My only theory on Beck's downward spiral is because he became a Scientologist and they sucked out his soul or something. It can't be a coincidence that after Sea Change he became a Scientologist. Hopefully his next album is better. He needs to break up with his girlfriend again.
2,"lazy lyrics, weak hooks, pseudo cosmology","What made early Beck so compelling was his word pairings ""Misery waits in vague hotels to be evicted"" (Tropicalia); ""I've been looking for my shadow but this place is so bright and so clean"" (O Maria). These were not just odd and arresting juxtapositions. They conveyed a sense a beautiful sadness Beck appears to have abandoned. I find this album to be an excercise (as in tired) in self-indulgence. Yes, the instrumentation, overlays and influences are interesting, but there's just no real feeling. Call it what you will, to be it is overlayering at the expense of substance. I'm not a big fan of Guero, but this album doesn't have anything close to the hooks of ""Girl"" or ""e-Pro"". The more promising hooks appear to be quickly abandoned."
5,"Fun and interesting, well worth it","What I sought when buying this album was a sequence of funky, mostly upbeat songs, not too repetitive, with some original melodies, use of computerized sounds, as well as this refreshing, contemporary feel to them. And thats pretty much what the album turned out to deliver. The first half of the album - mainly up to ""Nausea"" - is a sequence of cool songs, while the album gets more experimental and more downbeat towards the end - but still quite interesting. Favorite songs? IMO ""Cellphone's dead"" and ""Elevator Music"". Hits? ""Think I'm in Love"" and ""Nausea""."
4,"pure talent, great cd","Beck is the one of the best musicians today and never disappoints. The cd is a great listen. ""I think I'm in love"" is my favorite track on the new disc."
2,"nowhere man, please listen","This album seems to be going everywhere and ending up nowhere. What sounds like rap influences make the surrounding music sound like its falling down a flight of stairs. To me it was disappointing, I don't mind the direction of the sound, but would listen to David Bowie's ""Low"" or George Harrison's ""Wonderwall Music"" first."
2,Not as good as his other albums.,"It's just not. It doesn't have the weirdness that Beck fans have come to expect over the years. Buy Odelay, Midnight Vultures, or Guero instead."
3,Avoiding consistency,"Although Beck continued to streamline his diversely equal appreciation for rap, electronic, rock, folk, funk, and soul into digestible and recognizable concoctions, too much reused Information causes the disc to loose momentum about two-thirds through."
4,Hooked to the Groove.,"I've been a fan of Beck's music since his debut with 'Odelay'. If there's music that can stand out from the crowd it is this. Beck packs in a tight punch with great guitar riffs to his songs. His creativity for blending different generes of music is his greatest asset with a voice to die for. The Information continues showcasing Beck's amazing music deliverance , you won't stop stomping your feet with this album for sure.The information , and some songs from all of Beck's previous album would make a great soundtrack to the Ocean's 11 , 12 , 13 Triology. It fit's right in with the movie and you'll be asking for more of this class and style of music."
5,Liked this album a LOT,"Best album I have bought in several years. Nausea is an instant hit. DVD of the entire album just makes the package a bargain. Stickers are cool, as well.You won't be disappointed."
4,Takes a While to Suprise you,"When I heard Beck had a new album, I bought it immediatly. When I first listened to it on my stereo, it was completely different from his previous effort, Guero, which I was a bit dissapointed with. The Information is so much more electronic and the lyrics blew me away. After the first listen it actually seemed that Beck had lost his touch, because like Guero the songs seemed to drag on and not go anywhere for example, Movie theme and Motorcade. After a few listens I was obssesed with most of this album and the mood that each of them created. My favorites would have to be Elevator Music, Think I'm in Love, Cellphone's Dead, Soldier Jane and The Information. Please BUY this album, the unique stickers that enable you to customize the CDs and the case is worth it alone. Overall it gets a 4.25 in my book.My 2nd favorite Beck album if not for the few fillers."
2,This album is not worth the money.,"I suppose if you are a beck junkie than this is a must have but seriously,this album is just another dissapointment from beck along with sea change."
1,Once Beck always Beck,"This album is different but still what you would expect from Beck. By far the music is good as is par, BUT would somebody please explain to me WHY the DVD that came with it only has 2 channel Digital Dolby and is not 5.1 surround like his prior two albums? I would feel completely ripped off if I wasn't a Beck fan. No wait I do kind of feel ripped off."
1,a mulligan,"Putting the stickers on the cover was a wicked blast. It took me 20 minutes and I was so proud of my project, I scanned it and sent it to my mom.The music is typical Beck, the funky side. No ""Sea Change"" or ""Mutations"" here. It's perfect background noise, too, for like if you're scrubbing your floors or working on a paper or smoking up.I gave it 1 star because the DVD that accompanies the package is the single most self-indulgent tripe I have ever seen in my entire life. Beck is capable of so much better and THAT'S why I feel so put out. and taken advantage of. But it's ok, everyone's entitled to a few mistakes and in a career like Beck's, there haven't been many. I'll give him a mulligan."
2,This is Beck on autopilot... where's the inspiration?,"I'll have to say, I find it odd that Beck's getting so much love from the Amazon reviewers about his latest dud, The Information. Some of it sounds alright, but NONE of it sounds fresh or inspired. If it was put out by anyone else, I'd give it three stars; but I expect more from Beck.There's not much to say about this boring, underwhelming platter. It almost seems like it was created by a focus group, cooked up to sound like a Beck CD. But Beck's longtime fans know that Beck's CDs never used to sound like Beck CDs -- in other words, he's become predictable and safe. What a Snoozer.Beck has clearly jumped the shark."
4,A step between Sea Change and Guero,"This is decisively a better album than ""Guero"" but at the same time, it doesn't quite rank at the same level that Beck's ""Sea Change"" did a few years ago. It's got a very psychedelic feel to it which is infused with electronic beats in the best style of ""Guero"" and ""O'Delay"" and the first nine songs hold up very well in great Beck fashion. But towards ""Motorcade"" the album starts to go down a spiral that is unlike his other great works.Towards the end, ""The Information"" looses steam and focus, becoming the equivalent to a self-talking lunatic walking down a dark alley. When you consider the last song lasts well over 10 minutes and the complete album is a little longer than an hour, you realize you are in front of a good 45 minutes of great music, with fifteen minutes of odd padding wrapping things up in the end."
3,slightly disappointing,"This album feels like a transitional album that should go between SeaChange and Guero, not after both of them. It has some very good songse.g. Think I'm in Love and No Complaints - both of which have greatgrooves, catchy melodies, and the uniquely Beck mix of strange noises.Unfortunately it also has a lot of duds, e.g. Strange Apparition,which sounds like Beck weakly mimicking the Beatles, or Cellphone'sDead, which features a bass line that is identical in rhythm and toneto Chameleon by Herbie Hancock (get his album Head Hunters to hear theoriginal).Bottom line, The Information is worth getting, but for me it doesn'tachieve the level of greatness Beck's hit on Midnite Vultures, SeaChange, and Guero. More like a return to the inconsistency of Odelay."
5,A step forward for Beck. Very enjoyable!,"There is no doubt Beck is on a roll. Each disc he releases is more advanced than the last. The Information reveals more of itself through multiple listens, but the first 6 tracks hit hard. It's hard to argue with the quality of these songs, and the instrumentation is first rate. You won't be dissapointed."
3,Poor Job on this Vinyl Boxset!!,"I know 2 people that have this $200+ Boxset and are miserable with it. The pressing quality is awful, with multiple discs having to be sent back for replacement. The company that pressed them is very hard to deal with and it took months to get replacements. In one instance the replacement had to be sent back because it had the same problem as its predecessor. In another instance when the replacement came it wasnt an LP at all but a booklet for a Sigur Ross LP?! The mastering is very good, much better than on the original CD, but the constant skips and noisy vinyl make it hard to enjoy. Shame on the company who produced this set!"
2,Fair,Just another unsuccessful real estate agent posing as a successful expert in R.E. When all is said and done is more puffing as your money is going down the drain.
4,List & Sell,Great information on the basics of RE sales. A good reference opportunity for agents. Must read for new and even experienced agents.
5,"It's not ""commercial"" at all !","Several years ago, I have acquired the long playing record with the music of California Dreamin', and since then I've been hearing about it being a ""commercial"" recording ! All I can say is that an album with Don Sebesky arrangements and a bonus extra of Herbie Hancock piano sound could not be labelled as ""commercial"". The music is so beautiful and played with so much taste that at the end of listening to it one may want to start it all over again. I strongly recommend this CD for people that like the beauty of fine quality music."
4,A Charming 60's Musical Bouquet,"I have a sentimental attachment to this recording by Wes Montgomery. I bought the LP when it came out in 1965 or 66, everytime I play it, it takes me back to that era of recording. It is heavily orchestrated by Don Sebesky, but it does not obscure the unique sound produced by Montomery. I Love his rendition of ""Sunny"" and ""California Dreaming"". Beautiful music, and one of his last albums before his untimely death in 1968. You can't go wrong with Wes."
3,New Hampshire napping,Tasty textures emitted with effortless ease cannot amend dull pacing and pseudo-cultural phrasing.
5,"Writers and Artists, Don't Miss This Book!","After purchasing numerous ""how to overcome writer's block"" books, I accidentally stumbled across this book at the public library. What a find! I am now buying my own copy and giving the other books away.... For me, this book is more inspirational and constructive than even Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird and Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way. The writer addresses some typical writing blocks and how to navigate them. But this isn't your typical ""how to"" book. It's a personal, soulful book that exposes the root of creativity. I now see that my inexplicable writing block has been, in truth, a terror of FEELING. My thanks to the author for this insight ----- and for many other remarkable insights."
5,One of the best for new writers,"As a memoir and personal essay workshop leader, I highly recommend this book to every new writer in my classes. It's right at the top of my required reading list, along with Anne Lamott's BIRD BY BIRD and Brenda Ueland's IF YOU WANT TO WRITE. Aronie's book helps slice through the fear that haunts most new writers who aren't sure how or where to begin. Best of all, she highlights the importance of telling your own truth, which leads to the healing gifts of writing. Whether you want to write for your own pleasure or for publication, this is a wonderful book. A classic in the genre. -- Cindy La Ferle, columnist and author of WRITING HOME, www.laferle.com"
3,Misattributed quotations,"The Nelson Mandela and Goethe quotes are misattributed. That doesn't inspire confidence, and I wish they'd correct it. ""Boldness has genius"" is evidently by explorer W.H. Murray and ""it is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us"" is from Peace Alliance founder Marianne Williamson.I did like this book, though."
5,Believe in yourself.,"-- I like the way Nancy talks to me. She's a great writer and she's personal. This book is peppered with her intoxicating humor as well as filled with loads of useable techniques to tap into the ""still silent voice"" within is all. If you believe her, and you will, Nancy will convince you that anyone can write. Even you."
3,not as powerful as the sony name brand,"This battery is ok if you need it for the time being as you recharge your sony battery. However you will not get the same usage as if purchasing the real sony one. It's decent as a backup. So it may be worth it for the lower price, if you get a good deal."
1,The Camera that wasn't,I cannot review this product for you because the seller has never sent it to me. Nor has my money been returned. I am very disgusted with the whole business. It's too bad. It looked like a good camera.
5,World Class,"Having been a Boys Choir Trainer and Director I can apprciate the work that has gone into their World Class Boy Band.The distictive management of harmony and the magnificent blendingand complete balance of quality can move you to tears with the beautyThis Wonderful orgranziaiton should be better publisized and promotedthrought the worl. World Tours like North American, can only spell complete success The Music must be shared more adequaltely.Prizeman you are one of a kind. Keep up the marvelous work"
4,expanding hip hop's horizons,"This CD took a few listens to get used to, but once I did I really got into it. Bizzare hip hop with other influences thrown in (ambient, gothic, funk,etc.) This album is probably ahead of its time."
5,Great & Easy Wall Mount,"Great wall mount, very easy to install and packaged with compete set of 4 different size screws for all monitor applications."
4,Songs from Captain Ron movie on this CD,"I liked this CD, but I like the movie Captain Ron and many of the songs are similar."
5,Stylish Casual Shoe,"I love these shoes. They are the PERFECT size heel and I wear them mostly to add some flare to my casual wardrobe. I thought they were going to be a muted maroon color but they are actually muted GRAPE. I fell in love with them even more one I saw the unexpected yet rich color. They look fab with cocoa brown pants, especially. They are more of a FALL shoe if you ask me. My sister-in-law bought them in gold and she looked amazing pairing them with leopard and khaki."
3,"Full of disparate situations, but an ok film","This movie is ok. Sofia Vergara, Jaci Velazquez and Roselyn Sanchez do a pretty good job in the performances as 3 women that realize they are all dating the same guy, Eduardo Verastegui (who knew absolutely no English before this movie started). The movie is full of inside jokes (Roselyn Sanchez' character being confused as a beauty queen when in real likfe Sanchez was a Miss Puerto Rico Petite) and spanglish worlds. The humor, very much like Hispanic sitcomes, is full of ridiculous and disparate situations. I kinda liked the movie, especially cause Eduardo Verastegui was in it."
1,"This was a horrible and stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid movie","From beggining to end i was wincing in pain about how unfunny and stupid the movie was. Maybe I don't get it because i'm not latino, but then again i find most latino comedians and actors very funny and entertaining, so it just must be this bag of crap."
2,lite film with some Fun&Hot chicks,the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known Hollywood cliche in film making.I applaud the effort.the chicks in this Film are Happening Babes Fo SHO.but there ain't much to the Film but it has some fun to it.
3,For The Latina Lover In All Of Us,"Look at the DVD cover. If you like the cover, you'll like the movie. This film has assembled an amazing bevy of Latina beauties that is truly mindboggling. I'm not talking about just the three women on the cover (Roselyn Sanchez, Sophia Vergara and Jaci Velasquez). That's only the beginning. Just to name a few, your television screen will be graced by the likes of; Lisa Vidal, Nicole Scherizinger and Ivette Sosa (both formly of Eden's Crush), Joy Enriquez and Sandra Ramirez (my personal favorite). How's that for a line-up and still there's more.Oh yea, I almost forgot to mention the plot. Young, successful guy tries to juggle three girlfriends at the same time. I bet you've never heard that one before have you? On second thought, forget about the plot, just sit back and enjoy the scenery.By the way, for all the ladies out there's also Eduardo Verastequi in the cast to peek your interest."
1,What a piece of sh**!!,"This is the worst film i've seen in a long, long, long time. As i was sitting through this so called movie waitig for the credits to start, i found myself in mindnumbing agony. So i will not go in to the details of how stupid and just plain unfunny ""Chasing Papi"" actually is, because it would be just to painful (I'm not kidding).I urge anybody who is considering to rent or even buy this ""movie"" not to do so. There are plenty of other stupit comedies out there that don't make you whant to blow your brains out."
1,worst movie ever!!!!!!,"don't waste your money one of the worst movies I have ever seen no plot, vague story line, just terrible"
3,Entertaining,"I can't say this is one of my favorite movies but I did enjoy watching it. It had some laughs behind it and some crazy little things here and there. If you want to watch a movie of 3 beautiful women fighting for the love of one man and you want to see what women are capable of doing, then you want to watch this!"
3,Cute,"Cute movie the first time you watch it. But after one or two sittings, you'll get bored of this one. It's too sad, actually - but what can you do? Not all movies can keep you glued to the telly no matter how many times you've seen it before."
2,2 stars for cameos,"A dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the US and abroad. I was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen, but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target, I think it's just a shame.The whole cast was pretty much of Latin America origin, but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight. The plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many."
5,Canciones españolas,"I love this cd!I use it continuously in my work at the Academy of Music in Zagreb, Croatia. Maria Bayo is one of the most sensitive interpreters of Spanish music on record today and her technique is so easy it seems impossible!thank youCynthia Hansell-Baki', professor of voice and opera in Zagreb"
1,How do rate a card that's not available?,"How did the 'Electronics viewer from Washington rate this card if it's not available? (Especially when he recommends another card as 'better'.) I've checked a number of other sites and the PC vs. is definitly not available. I'm sure everyone accessing this site would like to know the answer to that. I even e-mailed Voodoo concerning a projected release date with no response. If you choose not to release this commentary then you should delete the 'rating' from 'Washington' as irrelevant. Actually the whole rating system is irrelevant, in my opinion, because it reflects opinions of 'past' purchases without correlation to 'upgrade' purchases. Is this fair, do you think?"
4,Not Quite the Product I expected,This card is great. Even though all the hype over the video card was great and well worth the reward of the graphics this card doesn't quite compare. Personally this card was great. it performed well in every aspect (ex. in surround sound with Counter-Strike and Half-Life) it is worth the money if you want good sound. If you want great sound I recomend the platinum card from sound blaster. Now that is a card!
5,FSAA must be seen to be believed,"I was an FSAA skeptic. Now that I've actually seen the Full-Scene Anti-Aliasing that the Voodoo5 can do, I am amazed! Even old games that looked jagged and dated on a GeForce look great with the Voodoo5's FSAA. With the updated drivers on 3dfx's website, you can also adjust the LOD bias to make blurry textures look crisp and sharp. This card will make all of your existing games look new all over again. The Voodoo5's image quality is better than any other card you can buy. It may not be quite as fast for Quake3 as a GeForce2 GTS, but the image quality is absolutely amazing. No more jaggies, no more pixel popping, and new life for your old games."
3,This product is not out,"There cannot be customer reviews yet, since this product has not been released yet. Please expain your previous reviews. I have placed a 3 rating because you have to put in something to post a review."
4,A good book to read when you're feeling sorry for yourself.,"Here's a character who's on the mother of all pity parties. Not that she didn't have things bad growing up. But sometimes you have to go beyond feeling sorry for yourself. Push yourself further than you thought possible. Find out what you're really made of. And, sometimes, as for Leah, you need someone to push you. Someone to make you care about more than just yourself. The plot has as many twists and turns as any mountain road."
3,A blast from the past,I forgot how different the 1970's are from today. I kept thinking the characters should have a cell phone. I loved the characters and enjoyed the adventure throughout the book. If you enjoy romantic / mystery give this one a chance.
4,A bit Wordy,The book was very helpful in my studies. At points it is hard to understand and I ended up looking up a lot of the words so that I could better read the context of the sentnces.
5,A CD that makes you examine your faith,"When you hear about this guy's life and you hear the words to his songs, it really makes you think what it means to stay faithful to God. It's so easy to want to blame God for everything when He wants nothing but the best for you.I don't think there's a song on this CD that I don't like, and I'm NOT biased :), and ""big muscles"" do nothing for me (well, I AM a guy).I saw Mr. Camp at ""Fun in the Son"" here in Tennessee, and it was a great show. Really funny guy and the band has great stage presence. Good to go see live as well."
4,Setting up Camp,This album really got JC on the map. This is still one of my favorite by Camp. he has a great voice. Song to song this album stays strong.
5,5 Star Debut Album,This is by far the one of the best mucisians out there! Jeremy Camp is a fine musician with great talent. his musical ministry is an inspiration to me and my family. this album Stay is a great album to have in your Jeremy Camp collection! If you have Restored but dont have Stay i definatly recomend purchacing this album as well! 5 star album i definatly recomend this album to anyone! Jeremy Camp is a staple in the christian music industry. Probably the best under the BEC record label.thanksPFC Jonathan Mallard
5,Great Trinitarian Introduction!,"Trinitarian Surroundings presents a great introduction to the study of the Trinity. With multiple authors from various backgrounds, this book opens up an array of topics centered upon a Triune God."
1,Bad Smelll,"I bought this September 05. It makes strong kinds of plastic smells. Even though washing this, it sitill make strong smell so, I can't use it now. I hope to return it but, retunring shipping cost is same as product price."
5,Just what I needed.,Great quality. Lots of ways to measure. They are perfect for me. I love how they have the 1/3 cup within the 2/3 cup and so on. It is just what I needed and great quality unlike my past plastic ones that had handles that broke off.
5,Has Worked Great for Me,"I have been lactose intolerant for years. This product allows me to eat ice cream and even cheesecake as well as all cheeses. In the past, I have tried other products but this works the best for me. I always carry it with me. One tablet is all I need."
2,One of Ornette's Worst,"I am huge fan of Ornette Coleman and own most of his albums. Tone Dialing is an attempt to break away from the acousic sound he used for so long and incorporate hip-hop and amplified instruments. He shoots and misses. His plastic horn is an afterthought behind the electric bass and heavy drums. And the reverb he uses is annoying. Simply, the group isn't nearly as good as his earlier groups. I would recommend The Shape of Jazz to Come, Change of the Century, or At the Golden Circle, anything but this one."
4,Great and useful book,"This should never be out of print. Not only is it a well-illustrated children's book in its own right, it does a job that needs doing: teaching children how to handle cats and that their own behavior can work against them. I used it with my own kids, and now I need it for my grandkids, who will fall over themselves chasing my cats, who, of course, run away. The main story line, which comes as no surprise, is older children and adults constantly tell this small girl to leave Herbert alone, when she has just accosted the cat and frightened it away. But the other good thing about this is that when the little girl finally figures it out (Want some tuna?) the adults see this has happened and stop hassling her. I hope I can find a copy."
1,Don't buy this stuffer,"There's at least a half-inch of space between the piston and the walls of the stuffer, so very little sausage goes out the tube. Most of it just piles up on top of the piston. Don't waste your money on this, unless you are going to use it for a trotline sinker. After trying this one time, we ordered the LEM 5-lb. stuffer and are very pleased with it's performance."
1,"A Pile of Scrap Metal, Poor Design","I purchased this unit last year, it sat in my storage room until this year ,then I decide to make sausages. What a bunch of junk, the piston would not seal and allow most of the meat to push passed the piston and back into the chamber. I could only put a small amount of meat in the unit because it would jam up. This piece of junk is going to the scrap heap. it was total frustration and agony to trying to stuff the casings. Also the unit surface is rough and very hard to clean, a serious health hazard if you do not properly clean the chamber and piston."
1,Save your money,"I hate to even write a review for this product. When I got it, there were parts missing, and what parts were there didn't work with the rest of the machine. I returned it and got the Eastman Outdoors 38237 Sausage Gun....It works great."
3,not for me,"I can't really rate this, I got for my brother, don't know if he used it yet to make his deer sausage this year."
3,a novel (pun intended) premise,"its a novel (pun intended) premise, but I didn't really like the vision of the future Anderson came up with. A shame that a vision of virtual immortality is so morally bankrupt. I did like the character that was loyal to his wife's memory. His marital fidelity was a bright counterpoint to the emptiness of Anderson's imagined easy going, free sex future. Would have been better if he had not said that he was ok with everyone else's immorality."
1,WRONG PICTURE,"The laser pointer that I received did NOT match the one in the picture. It looked similar, but that's where the similarities end. I have previously owned the one shown in the picture. It is made of metal, has metal tips, and the black button is made of rubber. THAT one felt like it was good quality. The one I received was made completely of CHEAP plastic and the button was gold. It feels like it's going to fall apart any time now, and I feel like I wasted my money. I'd like to see them ship the CORRECT item!"
1,Perhaps the worst book of its kind I had ever read,"I had read many business strategy books based on the writings of Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Machiavelli, Miyamoto Musashi etc. So bad that this is the worst I had picked. Clausewitz is great, but the authors are real bad in that they try too hard to impress by using superficial, vague, clumsy, English literature type of writing that complicates or even deteriorates Clausewitz's teachings instead of making them into something analytical and well structured, with relevant examples of real business world applications, even if it cant be as useful as the famous BCG Model (Stars, Question Marks, Cash Cows & Dogs). For those really interested in Clausewitz, please read his originals instead of wasting your valuable time on this disorganised and incoherent work of some....."
1,Dreadful book,"If you have interest in Clausewitz or business strategy, you can do much better buying other books. This is a very poorly written outing, practically incoherent. Embarassingly bad and jumbled. Do not be afraid to read Clausewitz directly: as this book illustrates, there are no easy shortcuts.Avoid."
4,Better than the original,"It pains me to say that. But these instrumentals are much better than the versions with vocals. Sorry dude, but you're not a great singer. ""Clean Living"" was awesome. But that doesn't mean you have to sing on every track. Stick to what you do best: making beats. For other vocalists. Or, as is the case here and on most of his best older songs, instrumentals. If you didn't like 'The Third Hand' before, give this one a shot. I consider it the better album."
3,Okay except scratches Treo,"I bought this for my Treo 700p. When new, it looks reasonable. The material is worn down in some areas after 3 months of use. I didn't need the pocket inside for memory cards but the button has scratched my Treo right on the Treo logo. It is disappointing to buy a device for hundreds of dollars then to have a cheap case scratch it. I flipped my phone around in the case so it is now scratching the back.The belt clip is a sturdy and strong pinching type clip. It does not clip around a belt but it has not popped off of my belt yet. The strong pinching type has scratched my belts (since pinches so firmly) and has pulled apart the material of one belt. I prefer clips that reach around a belt to clip and hold the pouch in place.I will probably look for a better case for my Treo. Overall I can't recommend this case.Unfortunately most cases are poorly made and break easily. My search will not be easy."
3,Ok but poor quality,Very effective case for Treo 700w however the leather is worn through on the edges like this was a defective or used case. However I purchased new. Would not have purchase this quality if I knew this was a worn case and would have paid more at the store to see it first.
4,Durable Case - But Scratches Treo 700,"I have had this for about 2 months and and love the case and it seems to be holding up to my rough treatment, however about 2 weeks into owning it, I realized there was a scuff mark on my Treo starting to form. It is right near the ear-piece, I thought I may have dropped the phone or something, but over the next few weeks it began to get worse, I finally realized that it lined up perfectly with the snaps that are inside of this case covering small pockets for caring items. After noticing this I began putting the phone in with the screen facing out, and the antenna pointing forward, does not appear to be making a scuff mark on the back of the phone.Overall a well constructed case, but if you are concerned about the appearance of your Treo make sure you put it in with screen facing out."
5,Palm Horizontal Leather Pounch,"This is a GREAT holster for your Palm or Blackberry product. I use it every day, all day for my Treo 650. Going horizontal is SO much better....and the magnetic clip is easy to use and secure.The original Treo 650 case could be swiveled to horizontal but was difficult to open quickly. The leather also looks much nicer in an executive environment. The price was fair and the delivery was quick.If you carry your palm all the time like I do....in and out of cars......at work and at home.....this is a GREAT case!"
2,Treo phone holster,"I've had it for a few months now and find that the interior rivets rub a spot on the back of the cell phone. The phone can also be turned on by itself or perform other actions because the holster side of the opening flap has a seam that transcends the key pad buttons, including the hot keys and when sitting in a car the seat belt buckle pushes on the phone case and the seam causes the phone to sometimes turn on and perform some random programs. Dangerous for contact lists etc. I have a few pictures of the inside of the phone case also.Phone can also be propelled out of the case with little force if the correct angle of bump is directed on the antenna while walking. The flap will pop open.I need to get another case."
2,Was mine the only with very poor craftsmanship?,"I owned this leather pouch holder for my Treo 650 for a full 2 months before the pouch fell apart completely, rendering it useless. The pouch is two separate components glued: the first part is the pouch itself, and the second part is the belt clip. After being happy with my product for 2 months, it spontaneously (not gradually) came apart where the belt clip is inserted into the pouch. A person walking behind me pointed out that my pouch and phone were on the floor; I looked down at my belt to see that the belt clip was still there. This is a great, space-saving way to store the phone, and I can't say that other pouches have the same defect, but the specific pouch that I purchased was of very poor quality, and almost resulted in me losing the very sensitive information contained on my Treo."
4,Excellent product at an excellent price,I got this pouch for my 700w treo. It fits nicely. Leather is nice. It has a side pocket for keeping creadit/business cards. But you can not keep too many only 3-4.
2,Good Product money wise but not Safe,"I am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather Pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . However While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo fell down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem . It has just a Magnetic flap which is of no use when your Expensive Treo Falls down Twice and has a Lot of Scratches on them . Hence if they would only have a Locking facility on the Flap it would be great."
5,Nice Holster,Much better quality of Treo holster than I have had in the past. This one should last a while.
5,Jazz organ at its best,This is far and away the best jazz organ CD I have ever heard. When he starts playing The Cat it brings back memories of when I had The Cat record album years ago. My other favorites songs on this CD are Groove Drops and Delon's Blues. If you are looking to start a jazz organ collection this would be an excellent choice to start your collection with.
5,Favorite Girl Goth Metal Album,"This album absolutely rocks. It stands up to repeated listening very well. It's my favorith Goth, girl album.The tracks and lyrics are pretty much goth, metal.This album has well constructed songs, with good lyrics and killer hooks. The vocals are edgy but not raspy, or overly sweet either. A lot of goth girl singers are too cloyingly sweet for me.The main themes are recognizable and unique to this band.And all of the tracks are excellent! So what's not to like?People who say this is not metal should give this one another listen or 3."
3,Heard them live...better on CD!,"They have a lot of...energy. I saw them in Dallas, (where every one of their songs ended with, ""Thank you Dallas, Texas! "") with doubleDrive (now THEY are good! watch for them!).I don't really know exactly how to describe what I feel when I listen to them. If the group Napalm Death were girls, well you get the idea. Buy it if you like angry, head-banging chicks."
2,not so hot,this cd wasnt really cool. the music itself is kinda slow and the guitar is too loose and slow. the vocals are ok but there is too much soft talkin and not enough singin. you cant really hear the bass. the guitar is played really heavy but not very well. the lyrics arent death or doom or whatever just average. overall not a cd to bang your head about but if you want a good one get system of a down.
2,2.5 stars...,I would have to give Freaks of Nature and Horror Wrestling 2.5 stars. This band seems to have wanted to be some kind of hard rock or metal act but comes out to be something else. I bought these CDs a few years ago and kept them for the few moments I like in the CDs and the fact that these are women. Unfortunately they never put out the better album I was hoping them to and I was left with sad and sleepy music. When I can name a dozen female acts that I really do like why would I have kept something that originally was supposed to rock but actually just ... who knows? Depressing is one word I would use.
5,Oh My,"One of the few CDs I can listen to over and over and over again. Not since ""Horror Wrestling"" has music unasthetically wrenched forgotten emotions from my guts."
3,okay.,"This album is awlright. It's for true Drainheads only. It isn't as good as horror wrestling, but then again it's a little different. It seems to me that these stunningly hot swedish girls(with the exception of the guitarist, who is from paraguay or uruguay or something) have calmed down quite a bit. At times, the songs tend to get monotonous, but there are some industrial elements thrown in as well, giving a listener a new sound with each song. The cover is worth the cost of the cd."
5,The second time around is even better!,Even better than their first album! Total rock and lots of feeling here...Great band with a lot to say and awesome rhythms. If you like rocker chicks then check this album out!
5,"overall, an awesome album","This one of the best CDs I have ever bought, and it's an absolute travesty that they don't get the recognition that they deserve. The only song on the album that I don't like is ""I Will Follow"", other than that, I practically worship this CD. ""I Wish"" is the best song I've heard in my entire life. When I first got the CD, I listened to that song all night, and I still can't get enough of it. The album is absolutely awesome, and you will not regret buying it. For everybody that complains about Drain STH, doesn't like them, or keeps saying that they sound like Alice In Chains, I have one thing to say: POWWWW!, get on deeznutz! Buy the album(actually buy both), put it on ""I Wish"", and you can thank me later. Peace."
3,Pretty Clever,"Fred. He works pretty well, screws onto a soda bottle and pours stuff out. I used it to water my plants. Good center of gravity makes it easy to handle the bottle. The only problem I have with it is that the water doesn't come out very fast, sort of a wide trickle. Definitely not instant gratification, but for the price, and with Prime, not too shabby a purchase. No color choice, no big deal, mine's pink."
2,Retarded Design,"The design is flawed! I had a plastic pop handle once that clipped on the bottom of bottle and around the neck so you could remove and replace the cap to pour your pop. It was very convenient but it broke after years of use. I cannot find a replacement anywhere!So, I purchased this thing. It screws on to replace the lid on the bottle. Then the pop flows thru the tube. So, you end up with a messy thing that you have to screw on and off each time you want a drink. Plus be careful you don't loose or accidently throw out your original lid! If you left this spout on your pop would go flat. I could only see this being useful if you are having a party and expect to use the entire bottle of soda. I would be better if they would put a cap on the end of the spout!"
3,child development book by Santock,"I needed this for my psychology class and the price was fair. I was disappointed though, b/c in the description it said no highlighting and there was moderate highlighting in the book. The main reason I had bought this particular one was b/c the seller had said in the description ""no highlighting""."
5,this is so gangster,"south central cartel returns with straight heat a classic must have album straight gangsterfied real chronic beats if you're sick of gay unit, and southern fried crunk and snap get this."
5,Redheaded daughter of NYC makes good,"Total work of artistic wonderment! This album is a sample of the many sounds of Amanda Kravat. She has such an interesting blend of lyrical and musical talent you won't be able to pull this one out of your disk changer for quite some time! If you are interested in music that is both insightful and playful, creative and catchy, smart and silly, or young and wise you must give this cd a run. Sheer joy, raw emotion, and talent which equals her personal beauty! MORE MORE! :)"
1,Diappointing,"The music book is great, with a number of nice songs and well written - the accompaning music, on the other hand, was quite disappointing; based on the songs I played.The selection I was most interested in was ""They Call the Wind Mariah"". This music was horrid! Basically the pianist, who could hardly wait to get this peice over - judging by the tempo, pounded this rather monotonous tune out in a rather laboureous fashion. True, the music was written that way, but still it was poorly done overall and just useless.""The impossible dream"" was only somewhat better and still played way to fast.So - so far not so impressed."
4,Tough going... make sure you're stable before reading!,"Eleven years after publication, this is still the only workbook for men who were sexually abused as boys. It's loaded with practical advice for handling many of the lingering symptoms. In fact the book itself can be overwhelming if you aren't careful. Read it in small chunks. I'd even advise seeing a psychotherapist or other counselor while reading this book, just to make sure you have somewhere to turn if the triggers get too intense."
3,Pretty good,"I like this book, I like how it flows and I think the ideas presented are good. It should be helpful for a lot of people. But, sometimes things don't work out for abuse victims. There should be another chapter in this book that gives some idea on what victims should do if nothing seems to work. Sort of like an ""in case of emergency break this glass"" kind of chapter. It could present some ideas on how to give up the losing battle, get on with your life, and try not to get too depressed."
2,Disappointing,I don't appreciate authors taking side tangets to promote their political leanings-especially when I strongly disagree with them. The author seemed more focused on interfering with parental rights than with healing men damaged by abuse.
5,Victims No Longer,"This is an excellent, straight-forward, sensitive book that deals with a topic that is difficult. It is written so that it can be easily understood and is incredibly helpful to victims as well as therapists who treat them. The author validates the victim's world and encourages the victim to get help and talks about the many males who have survived and are healing."
5,Great Book,Thus is for people that want to come back if they have any more things to work on within themselves and it lets you know there are others of us out there.
5,An Insightful Look At The World,"First let me say I've been a fan of JFK for many years. And yet I had never read this book. As the 40th anniversary of his death approached, I decided to read this book and was stunned by how wise his analysis was of the British situation prior to WWII. His observations about Churchill were quite right, and his assessment of why England hung back when other parts of Europe were falling was so clear and correct, that I had to keep reminding myself that this was written in 1940. I also could see how he used these observations to craft his own view of foreign policy and defense for when he became President. I'm glad I read this book. It's well worth the time."
4,Birth of a Statesman,"Young John F. Kennedy wrote a thesis at Harvard that foreshadowed his potential greatness as a statesman. This is a factual look at Britain's actions prior to the Second World War. Interestingly, the book also foreshadows America sleeping prior to September 11, 2001. Britain as a Democracy was unprepared to take on the totaltarian Nazi state. Sound familiar? This book is timely reading in the 21st century. I hope that it is re-released either to the public, or as a text book for students of diplomacy."
5,This Is The Book John F. Kennedy Wrote When He Was A Harvard Senior,"""THIS IS THE BOOK JOHN F. KENNEDY WROTE WHEN HE WAS A HARVARD SENIOR... the thesis that earned him graduation honors in international relations... the book that won him acclaim here and abroad when it was first published in 1940---a best seller that went through six editions... the book that Henry R. Luce praised in his Foreword to the 1940 edition:""For all Americans who are wide awake enough to read... this book is invaluable...Why England Slept is a remarkable book in many respects.....""[from the book of the back of the jacket]"
1,"Poor, ghost-written history","First, JFK did not write this book. Rather, it was written for him by a number of people, and one of the writers described it as 'a very sloppy job, mostly magazine and newspaper clippings stuck together', when seen in its original state. Joe Kennedy, the President's father, made it a best-seller by using his influence with publishers like Henry Luce. Old Joe also helped out by purchasing 30,000 to 40,000 copies of the ""book"" and storing them at the family compound in Hyannisport. See Paul Johnson's A History of the American People for full details... Save your money, and your time."
3,Fun game but...................,It is a fun game with good gaols but loading times are to long to have the game be enjoyable...if i wanna press the select button it will have to load. it has to load for every little thing i do!!! this is sooo much better on gba sp but i sold that
1,boring,i think that ea games did a horible job on the sims 2 and sims 2 pets.If you did want to get the sims i would recomend the sims 2 for computerut dont let the sims trick you you have to buy the normal sims 2 and install it then you can use the expansion packs any ways do not get the sims for psp
3,"Fun game, but loading times are annoying.","The Sims reminds me a lot of Bustin' Out for the GameBoy Advance, in that you have to figure out puzzles, play mini games, and make friends (and enemies). This time you're stuck in the Sims 2 suburb of Strangetown, and there's a lot of strangeness going on.The graphics are very nice, and the game play itself is enjoyable, but I really feel like it's hampered by the frequent pauses to load data from the UMD. The loading screens between locations are not bad; but when you talk to someone, or play the mini-game chatting game, and each time the system has to access the UMD to load the voices and animations, it really makes the game feel choppy.I really wanted to love the game, even knowing that it wasn't going to be free-form Sims as in the PC game. I do enjoy the gameplay, but overall I'd have to give it just three stars, due to the frustration of loading all the time."
1,Unplayable,"I love the sims. Always had, ever since the first sims came out on PC. Naturally, I was excited to get this version, and take the sims with me anywhere! Boy, was I wrong. This is nothing like the old sims we all know and love.First off, I never ran into anything 'simmy' about it. Like someone else said, it's basically a 1st person rpg. No house building, etc.Secondly, the loading times are the worst I've ever seen on any system ever. The disc is constantly thrashing in the PSP, and it seems like nothing pre-loads. Even going up to talk to a person makes it hang for a good 2-3 seconds. Then you go into a house, another 2-3 seconds. Then, you open a door, 2-3 second hang. It goes on and on. The game could have been mediocre, but the implimentation was horrible. Trust me, I can wait for something to load, I'm not just annoyed becuase it's an occasional thing. It's all the time and it's rediculous. It shouldn't have even been allowed to be on the psp. Ebay, here I come!"
3,Loading time takes up most of your playtime,"The storyline sounds fun. The game has great potential, but I probably won't finish it until a year from now. The load time sucks. You can actually hear the UMD churning away with every game move you make. Loading time frustrates you & you end up turning the game off. EA either didn't care or was in such a rush to get this game out that the consumers were forgotten. They know the SIMS games have an excellent rep, so we all would buy it. There's no excuse for this lapse in detail."
3,Too much time waiting to play and some crashing,"If you don't mind [pause...] waiting for the data [pause...] to download [pause...] while playing [pause...], then this is the game for you [pause...]. The game also crashes often. If you decide to play, make sure you SAVE A LOT. Overall, I like the idea of having my favorite game on the PSP but I think that it needs improvement."
3,*SLOW!!!*,"When i first saw this game on the shelves, i though *wow* because it is for psp. I am a big sims 2 fan, and i thought it would be just as good as on the computer. ANYWAY i inserted it into my psp and from when it started the load times were SLOW AS!!!! The graphics are amazing, but the plot is confusing (sometimes) and building up skills is a real hassle. Anyway i think you would be better off buying the sims 2 for computer to prevent you from throwing your psp out the windows with its terrible load times."
3,sims 2 psp,"This game came with no game case. And the white outer case was broken. It only works sometimes. I tried taking it to Gamestop to trade it for another copy, but they said it wasn't worth anything. I had to buy another one."
3,Fun Game,I love any Sims game - this game for my PSP was a little disappointing - it does not compare to any computer game - it does not have the details that anyother Sims games have - it is fun and I would recommend buying it - it is fun to have a game I can take on the go
3,Game okay but a little confusing and boring,"The Sims 2 is all about figuring out where to go. This game has a lot less towns then you would think, only 4!!! it is really hard to keep your sanity meter from running low and after i finished it i realized it would be hard to play over since i already knew where everything is. i would'nt recommend to people who like to play things over but overall i would probably give it a 75 out of 100."
1,Nothing like the Sims.,"This game is nothing like the sims on other platforms, it is a 1st person role playing game, where you walk around doing dumb little tasks to stop yourself from getting a headache. It is similar to the game boy advance version, but the graphics are a lot better and game play is a lot worse. Simple conversations with people are now a chore, and any ground you make how ever little gets lost if you don't meet these silly goals you don't really care about it. So I'm going back to my PC to play it and the Game boy when I am traveling. Its a shame they didn't try to make a sims version like the PC version and forget the neighbourhood and concentrate on the house building."
2,"Grind, Grind, Grind, CRASH!","This game had so much potential. Great story, great graphics. It would have been a fun, portable version of ""The Sims 2"" that was much more faithful to the original PC version than the versions for DS and GBA.Unfortunately, the horrific load times and crash-proneness ruined that. Any time you do ANYTHING in this game, the game has to load from the disk. And load, and load. So you're sitting there listening to it grind and looking at a spinning hourglass.The funny thing is that there's only really about 5-6 hours worth of game here, but it takes at least three times that because of all the loading.Even worse is its tendency to crash. While I was playing, the game crashed several times, requiring me to restart my PSP and go back to a save file. Worst of all, it consistently crashed on the game's finale.I'm glad I just rented this one. It's defintely not worth what they're charging for it."
5,Nice stuff,Games just fine nothing to worry about. Good litte life lessons in these games to. Keeps them off some of the shoot them up games.
5,any punk should own this album,"I owned the Punk Singles Collection for years and finally decided to buy this and it was well worth it. Vicious Circle, Burn Em' Down, Attack, Juvenile, and Urban Rebel are the kind of songs that defined punk and are probably responsible for shaping into what it is today. The songs that you will not find on singles or best of really make this worth owning. BBCm Just Another Punk Band and When the Punks Go Marching In will have your fists in the air"
4,Hardcorcito,"of course is a great album! not all songs, the track ""when the punks go marching in"" is the best, but pay attention to ""BBC"" is great and fast. This is the best cd you can get from the band, next album (Black Leather Girl) is not as good as this one, sounds like Metal (I hate metal). this band goes in the line of One Way System or Partisans."
3,Disappointed,"I am a fan of Fode Baro, but I didn't care much about the songs on this CD. I should have listened to all the sample songs before purchasing the CD."
5,wonderful storytelling and a fun study aide,"Ive studied Nihongo for 2 months and only know 175 kanji but bought this anyway to motivate myself. As expected, it's beyond my reading level, but I was able to recognize some kanji and get a feel for how ""real"" Japanese differs from the exercises in my Genki text. I'll read the easiest story again in 6 months and again in 1 year to check my progress.The MP3 file for Soseki's ""First Night"" is a treat for the ears and while I only understand the 1st sentence (""I had a dream"") I have a better grasp of proper Japanese pronunciation and pace --- unlike Pimsleur CDS which are artificially slow by necessity. In short, even if you're a rank beginner like me, I highly recommend buying this."
5,Very Helpful,"I have two coppies of this book, the first one fell apart from over use. I absolutly felt in love with Soseki's Yume Juu Ya, specifically the seventh night. Yabu no Naka, and Rashomon are also very important works of fiction (the basis for Kurosawa's Rashomon), and so there is endless things to think about here as one reads and rereads these stories learning all the various Kanji, vocab, etc. My only complaint is that the Ten Nights of Dreams are not compleatly represented here... then again the ""nights"" that are not included here can be found in their original Japanese on aozora as they are in the public domain. Happy readings!"
4,Good Book,"I bought this book for my wife, and as usual, it arrived on time and in great shape. No problems. As usual, 4 Stars because only God is Perfect."
3,Well written but...,"It was a very well written book but everyone told me this was a good romance book. It was not a romance book, a romance book is a book where both people love each other. Rhett loved Scarlett for most of the book, but Scarlett did not love Rhett so how was this romance?It was very good other than that though, I had trouble putting it down just to go to sleep. It is very well written and unlike some authors she actually puts in a lot of description."
1,Page missing!!!!!,"I thought that amazon would have fixed the problem by now, but no. Page 713 is still missing, and in its place is page 813. I just got it in the mail as a Christmas gift and decided to check to be sure. I am so mad and disappointed with Amazon right now. Hopefully they will resolve the problem quickly. Bigtime bummer."
2,OVERRATED!,"Ugh -- By the end of this book, you're going to want to slap Scarlett silly. I'm angry that I wasted the past month of my life reading this book. Mitchell must have been getting paid by the word because she goes on and on and on about nothing. This book could have easily been 600 or 700 pages shorter. The romance between Rhett and Scarlett is not believable. A cold, drab book. Save yourself the agony: rent the movie."
5,Excellent book,"Great Classic, an awesome book. A must have for all who love reading. I really recommend it. I'm still reading, it has over 1000 pages, also a true gift for those who love old stories like me."
4,Gone With The Wind,I read the preface and felt a connection because i was born and im being raised inthe south(south carolina) im 10
2,NOT FOR A GIFT,The book was intended as a gift but was in too poor condition to be given. I was disappointed.
3,I had a hard time with this book.,"It started very slow for me, with Scarlett's fleeting thoughts about her dresses and balls. Then every time it became intriguing the conflict resolved itself, except for the conflict between Scarlett and Rhett which only gradually compounded. The dénouement was poignant and well conceived-- perhaps it's just the romantic in me but I choose to see the end as just the beginning."
5,Gone with the wind,I loved that book and i couldn't put it down. It is one of the few books that just keep you occupied in your mind long after you finished it.
5,The greatest book I've ever read!,"I read this amazing novel approximately two years ago, since then I have read it several more times. It only took me about one week to read, I was so wrapped up in it that I put off homework to read it, I simply couldn't put it down. Believe me I don't read anything that fervently, other than Gone With the Wind. It is so descriptive, it wraps you up in this amazing story of love lost and lives, wasted on petty things. I personaly felt for the characters, being a hellraiser myself, I truely felt for Scarlett's plight and pain. I think that if you are a person who can be unaffected by all the media hype put into things, and just read this book you will be swept away by it's dazzling imagry and depiction of life and love and loss."
2,gone with the wind,This book was advertised as large print which is what my elderly mother needed. It arrived and it was not large print but normal print. The company apologized and stated they did not have a large print but to keep the book they sent.
5,Love this,Most incredible read. I highly recommend it to all age groups. So beautifully written it was so though I was brought to scene of the story.
4,A Poignant and Breathtaking Civil War Novel by Margaret Mitchell,"Preceding the Civil War, talk in Atlanta is rife with apprehension and speculation that warfare lies in the near future. Gone with the Wind revolves around the initially idyllic existence of a belle, Scarlett O'Hara, her unsteady marriage with the scandalous Rhett Butler, and her unforeseen reality during the heart of the Civil War. The sentimental page-turner demonstrates inspiring courage, outrageous fervor, and dramatic life alterations, in an emotional episode...brought to life!"
5,Feeling and vigor,Forget fifty shades of gray! This is a true love story. A story with meaning and feeling. Gone with the wind will burrow deep in to your heart.
5,Its so great to read on Kindle so great to read again,"I bought it for my kindle, because its summer and there will probably never be a better beach read or a better book ever anyway. Scarlett still steals your breath with her personality and Rhett still makes you swoon and this is still the best book I ever read."
4,Scarlett's perspective,"I read Gone with the Wind many years ago, so it was a pleasure to read it again. I only gave it 4 stars because I almost always wanted to have a ""talk"" with Scarlett. I am so glad she ""grew up"" finally at the end... a little too late, but better late than never. I loved the history that Mitchell sprinkles through the book. I also enjoyed seeing how some things never change. Such a pleasure to read."
5,"a book filled with romance,passion,adventure, and much more!","gone with the wind is a beautiful story that brings smiles, laughs, gasps, sorrow, tears, joy, and pictures in your mind that are so real, you start to see, smell, taste, feel, hear, and be the story. It is beautifully written, so that it becomes real. Gone with the wind is perhaps the most beautifully written story of all times."
4,masterpiece but deeply flawed by its racism,I am torn. Half of the time I love the intricate characters and the relatonships between them and how it is all so skillfully braided together by a master wordsmith. I have trouble believig it was her first published one. A few flaws like too much obvious foreshadowing of one or two events but truly literature. Half the time I feel like shaking the chracters and the author for the blind racism that was breathed in like the air. That is why I gave this nook only four stars. Yet I would recommend including it in reading for college age or above as and example of these attitudes but accompanied by works of African American author covering the same historical period.
5,great literature,"A true American classic, Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell is a must read for anyone who likes a good story about survival, betrayal, love, and historical fiction. Set in the Old South before, during, and after the Civil War, Scarlett O'Hara must grow up, leave her comfort zone and survive numerous hardships. Although the movie has caught the essence of the book, actually reading this novel is a must for every independent woman in America."
5,The Great American Novel,"Love in the time of war! You can't beat it. The first time I read this book I was interested in the love story. When I read it again, I was mesmerized with the portrait of a time and place which have been erased from our collection memory by layers of political correctness. This paperback edition is lovely, by the way, and it doesn't break apart the way some big paperbacks can."
5,good book and great movie,"I loved all the nfo from the book that the movie couldn't give, it was a goo, but long read."
5,The best book I have ever read!,"This book can touch so many emotions. From laughter to tears. The historical value even though the story is fiction, is remarkable."
2,New my foot...,"Cheap binding, rough page edges, and looks like its been sitting on a bookshelf in direct sunlight for 20 years. The product was advertised as new, but most definitely isn't."
5,loved it,"""Gone With the Wind"" is about a Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara, during the Civil War and Reconstruction. Scarlett is a headstrong girl that is different from other girls. She gets married young, then becomes a widow. When death of many of her closest friends and family die, as well as escaping from the Yankees, she changes for the worse. She tries to win the attention of the so-called love of her life, while trying to keep the respect of her neighbors, who think she's scandalous. Will she survive with the ways in which she was brought up?"
4,A classic!,"What can I say? This one is a classic! A very good historical romance set in the south during and after the Civil War. I cannot help but love and hate Scarlett O'Hara, both for her feisty spirit, her stubborn disposition, and her passion for the unobtainable. If you've never read this book, you should."
5,"ACTUALLY, it's, 'My dear, I don't give a damn'.","Every time I read this novel, it makes me stop and think how there could be so few genuinley talented people on this earth, with someone like Ms. Mitchell to set such a fine example. Her ability to make the characters jump out from the pages is astounding. Her description of raw, human emotion move Scarlett from haughty, capricious and naive, to indignant, through livid and past loquaciously melancholy. This novel is unforgettably and extraodinarily real, penetrating, and poignant. And as for the sequel, A.R.'s 'Scarlett', I think it was great. Obviously not as good as the original, but the effort was recognized and well noted. (I hope that doesn't in any way sound patronizing). I recommend both novels to all ages, and regardless of what type of books you usually like to read. Guaranteed, you will love it!"
3,Great book but don't buy this edition...,"I love this book and have read it many times however this particular edition is missing a page, page 713 has been replaced with page 813, and you don't want to miss a word of Gone With the Wind!"
5,Truly the greatest novel ever written.,"Margaret Mitchell's epic novel ""Gone With The Wind"" defies all ratings. It deserves far more than a mere ten. I read this book when I was 13 years old, and discovered the most unforgettable story with the most vibrant, LIVING characters ever written. To me, Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Melanie Wilkes, and all the others are truly real people. The movie ""Gone With The Wind"" is undoubtedly the greatest film ever made, which it could hardly help being with such a story to work from. This book can and should be read by anyone who loves to read, because it is simply too good to miss."
5,The Greatest Book Written,"Being raised in the south myself, I feel a kinship to Scarlett O'Hara. Margaret Mitchell's book has keep me captivated since I was a child. GWTW was one of the first book reports I gave in jr. high school. The teacher couldn't believe that someone of my age could have read such a book. Although it took close to a week to read it, GWTW has stayed in my mind and heart in all the years that have followed. No book has made the impression that this one has made on me. I don't believe there is one that could. The first copy of this book I ever got has long since had the ink rubbed from its pages. It was well worth the time that is takes to read it. It is TRULY a classic"
5,Scarlett and Rhett - unforgetable,"Margaret Michell's GONE WITH THE WIND is a tragic saga that can never be forgotten once read. Scarlett O'Hara is headstrong, intelligent, bold, and beautiful but she also makes mistakes. She is selfish and lives for the present. Rett Buttler is one man no woman can ever forget. He is the perfect father and lover whom is first consumed wholly with Scarlett and then driven away by her. Scarlett's frivolousness will be turned over and over in your mind. If you want to read a truely absorbing, romantic, historically accurate book let this one be your first choice"
3,Vividly Depicted Characters,"This book has created intriguing characters. But the main characters like Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett are admired and glorified to a fault. Scarlett O'Hara is tough, practical and no-nonsense. But in essence, she's a villain with these qualities. She steals her own sister's boyfriend, emotionally abuses her children, marries men for money and spite, and cheats on everyone and anyone. Seems there's nothing she would not do for money and for herself. Surely she has certain qualities that are needed in a war to survive, but it's not the war that made her selfish to the core. It simply brings out her selfishness on a larger scale."
5,gone with the wind,this is a great book and I am enjoying every page. I read the book many years ago but it is worth reading again very nice to read on a kindle
3,Great Story; Disgusting Philosophy,"This is a great love story with more than a smidgen of insight into the human psyche, but it is also an offensive apologia for the American Original Sin--slavery. This is our Wagner. If you read it in public, don't forget the brown paper bag."
3,Book,"I really liked this book. I'm a very very fast reader, and I read it in about one and a half hours. I really liked this book. It is a very nice story about the Civil War from a southerners point of view. You don't see very many books like that. I especially liked the part where they have to work in the fields. It shows that the Confederates didn't like the treatment of slaves, but they didn't care about the slaves. I kind of liked this book."
3,I was disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this hyped-up book. Melly was all good and Scarlett all bad. This plot is good, but I think Margaret Mitchell did not develop the characters as much as she could have. Humans are not either good or bad, everyone has a bit of both in them. However, I could not put it down, and it is such an epic story of American history that I would recommend it, just don't expect it to be as great as it is said to be."
2,"It's Fiction, not History","The book is better than the movie, and might be worth reading if you need an immense tome to take on vacation. Much as I despise this silly book, I have to admit it is a prime page turner.Its chief interest as a book is as a window into the viewpoint of history so common in the white upper crust South in the 1930's. The casually racist attitudes of Margaret Mitchell are a good example, and enough to make any quasi-enlightened being howl with outrage. Ditto the views on Andersonville, Reconstruction and especially the benefits of slavery to Black people."
3,Not bad.,"Not a bad novel for a first writer. It could almost be a classic except for a few points - a) it's unecessarily long and could have used more editing; b) the second half is weak and not very interesting; c) it's description of Reconstruction is very one-sided and half-correct and d)it's too racist. Other than that, it's not bad."
5,Amazing and will always remain as the best book ever!!!!!,I ablsolutely loved this book! It always kept me turning the pages. The descriptions were wonderfull and the story was the best ever!! This book will remain my favorite and it will always be remembered as a master piece. I recommend this book because I loved it and know you would too.
5,A Timeless Romance,"Gone With The Wind is a timeless romance that depicts agreat picture of what life was like during and after the Civil War. Once loved by all the men in the County, Scarlett's life takes a turn after the war. She ends uo in Atlanta where her reputation is ruined by gossip. The ending was kind of disappointing, but it leaves plenty of room to imagine what could happen. There is something for everyone to relate to in this book. I have no doubt that this book will always be remembered as the greatest romance novel of all time."
4,Love Story?,"It was amazing to me how much I could love a book with so few admirable characters. (One wonders if the film, ""The War of the Roses"" might not have been contrived from the story of Rhett and Scarlett.) But in all of her rage, Scarlett's stength and determination still makes her an attractive character, and after all of her shenanigans, you still want her to win. When assessing the characters, it is important to remember that they lived in a society where they played by different rules, often rules difficult for us to understand (e.g. rules regarding what constitutes adultery; and unbending rules of loyalty that might otherwise escape many of us). But all in all, beauty seems only to be found in Melanie and Mammy; a pitiful sympathy for Ashley and the other fallen ""Old Guard""; and a most certain feeling that, indeed, Scarlett and Rhett, deserved each other, pain and all."
5,Probably the best ever,"First I fell in love with the movie,then I read the book.The edition I have was my moms from the 1930's so i think its an original copy.This story is more than a love story. It is a study in human nature from Scarlets temper tantrums to Rhetts deep devoted love of Scarlet so much so that he has to leave her for his own good.This is undoubtly the best book ever written and by a newcomer at that. Margaret Mitchell outdid herself on this one."
5,Classic Masterpiece!,"This was my first time reading this classic and I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. If this has to be the book you choose for your next read, make it this one for sure!"
5,Gone with the Wind,It's no wonder this is the second most sold book in history. The movie just doesn't do the book justice; the book really puts you in the south during the Civil War. Great read!
4,4.5 Stars,"Wow, the civil war from the southern POV, who knew? Yes, racism is rampant, but I loathe history and I loved this book."
5,A diamond in the rough,"I read this book once. Once was enough, but twice would be better. I'm an avid reader, and writer. This book captured every emotion that literary devices are suppose to capture. I found myself crying, laughing, scared, shocked. I've been searching for a book that competes with Gone With the Wind and haven't found one. You know the main characters like they are in your life, and you're taken back to the Civil War. Nothing is downcasted, everything is how it was in the eighteen sixies. Scarlett O'Hara was such a wonderful character, she lives in everyone hearts long after the last page is turned. Even though the book is lengthy, it keeps your attention, truely, until the last page and would keep it further if it were longer. The book was amazing, a true American Literature Classic. I highly recommend this book. You won't be able to find another like it. Gone With the Wind is a true, diamon in the rough."
5,Gone With The Wind book,The price could not be beat! It is a long book and I hadn't read it for 40 years. I love the story and wanted to re-read it. Thank you for the fantastic read at a fantastic price.
3,missing page11,"I was feverently reading a key scene between Rhett and Scarlett last night and when I got to page 713 - there WAS not 713. It was page 813!! Uggh! What a bummer. Great story, one of the best I've ever read, but that missing page really breaks up the flow. Buy a different version!"
4,"Easy to read, difficult to deal with","Like it or not-- and there are PLENTY of reasons not to like GWTW-- this book earns its status as a classic. It reminded me of Anna Karenina: well-written, brilliant & deliciously soapy plot, and ultimately depressing. In the end, I was fed up with Rhett & Scarlett, but I still cried for them.As a northerner living in the south, I got a new appreciation for/insight into the rich history of white southerners, but good luck finding any insight into the world of black southerners. True, Mitchell was a product of her times and one needs to allow for that, but she says some HORRIBLY insensitive things about black people.If you read this book, keep it in context. Remember that it is only one part of history, only one book, somewhere in the middle of truth and lies and legend.P.S.-- Zora Neale Hurston's ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" would be an interesting book to read afterwards, especially if you need to restore your faith in true love."
3,Ola's Review to Long Books,"Imagine that in a flurry, your old life disappears; what was once poverty and happiness has transformed into poverty and a new, bittersweet lifestyle. Welcome to Scarlett O'Hara's corrupted world, where what once seemed improper is now necessary to survive. I thought this book brilliantly combined romance, adventure, and non-fiction information based on the southern aspect of the Civil War."
3,Quite fair...,"This book is quite fair, not exactly the best, but good enough. I thought it should be a very challenging book but I was disappointed...I read it last year (13 yr old) and was astonished on how easy the vocabulary is and how easy it is to read this book.As for the story...it's pretty good. I really like those historical novels, and the writing and descrbtion is wonderful... but some parts of the story is a drag."
2,"Frankly, I don't give a damn","My father browbeat me into reading ""Gone With The Wind"" when I was a teenager. To this day I can't understand what all the fuss was about. Scarlet is such a spoilt snit that I couldn't care what happened to her. I guess this is one book you either love or hate, so I recommend that you check a volume out of the library and read a chapter or two. If you hate it, you've lost nothing but a little of your time. If you love it, well, there's no accounting for taste."
2,ordered new but got used,"I placed an order for a new one, but got a used one with several markers and dirty. So, I am so disappointed with this book."
4,"roll, jordan, roll","As others have said in their reviews, GWTW is a great book. To repeat all the reasons why would be quite redundant of me. Simply, I recommend GWTW if one wants to discover the white southern female point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. I also recommend Harriet Jacobs' ""Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl"" to anyone BRAVE enough to discover the black southern female slave point of view concerning the Civil War era American south. Seeing as GWTW is very long, and Ms. Jacobs' work is around 200 pages, I'd read ""Incidents"" first. It's another truly amazing literary work...an account of southern slavery from the pen of a former slave herself! There is much much interesting information concerning the relationship between mistress and female slave/house attendant that will provoke thought as one reads GWTW afterwards."
3,I liked this book,I liked this book because it was fun to read but I did not like the way Scarlet actted.
3,"good, but too long","Nice story, feels a little like a soap opera at times, but the civil war part of the story is excellent. Could have and should have been shorter...lots of filler.Overall it is pretty good read."
3,this is a good book,I think that Gone with the wind is the best book ever written the movie is a winner to . I love how it informs you of everything that is going on. You go through the whole book like will Scarlett and Redett get together or will they stay together will Scarlett finally get Ashely. Will they survive the war. Who will live and who will die. You read through the tragides and the good times . I give Gone with the Wind and will argue with anyone who differs.
3,all the racist babble just goes on and on ad nauseum...,"It's an ok story until after the war and then how they turn on the poor old masters and blah, blah, blah... pure southern womanhood all a-fearin' them free black men going around crazy raping... oh come on Margaret, where did you do your research?Just too much of it... and I'm not really so sure Scarlet is so bad, she seems the only one capable of doing the work it takes to get the whole family out of all the scrapes they are in... so what's wrong with that???Well, must consider when it was written I suppose... next I'm reading ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
5,"I became one with the character, Scarlett!","Read this book. And then read the sequel by Alexandra Ripley. Gone with the Wind is THE BEST! Beautiful, witty, definitly involved. What I love about these two books is that I became the character. I had read about her so much that I knew her inside and out, and I like books that do that for me. Margaret Mitchell is truly amazing and Alexandra Ripley did an outstanding recreating Scarletts life."
4,A Novel that Changed the Civil War Perspectives,"Are you looking for a book that will be refused to put down? Then you may have just hit the ultimate jackpot;Gone with the Wind is a flurry of different themes that come together in one book,each of which beckon the reader to follow word after word to the last period.From romance to adventure, this book brilliantly entwines descriptions that come alive and stir emotions from deep in your heart.The author,Margaret Mitchell, carefully picks out her characters to make a rather interesting and unique combination that make this novel come to life.Join Scarlett O'Hara,the once pampered belle of the County,as she fights to regain her old life's treasures after the destructive effects the Civil War.Some will be frustrated,others,left melancholy,but the outcome of this beloved story is guaranteed to be breathtaking,one way or another."
5,One of the Best books I have ever read,"I read it when I was 11 and I could hardly put it down, it took me 5 days to read this amazing book. Sure there is a dead spot in the middle and it gets a little depressing, but it is worth the read. I recommend this book to anyone who likes civil war romance."
4,"Excellent Book, Not So Excellent Edition","You can tell by every other review of this book and probably by the advice of people you know that ""Gone with the Wind"" is an enduring classic. I LOVE THIS BOOK! But, be warned that this paperback edition has several spelling and gramatical errors. I was quite disapointed by the editing done here."
5,The Best Novel Ever,"I read the book before seeing the movie, and the movie makes the book look horrible! I have read GWTW at least ten times and it gets better everytime I read it. I can picture the scences as I read the book. This is the ultimate love story about a woman looking for love and security when it's right in her face. I always cry at the end but I know Scarlett will get Rhett back, she'll just put it out of her mind and think of it tomorrow."
4,"Flawed, but unforgettable","GWTW has many flaws -- the political views of the book can be most kindly described as ""naive,"" and its racism is apparent on virtually every page. The second half of the book feels rushed; once Mitchell has actually united Scarlett and Rhett, she no longer seems to write them with the same imagination and humor. All that said, this is the quintessential blockbuster -- not a deep book by any means, but entertaining in ways most novels or movies could never dream of being. Mitchell has a gift of creating fantastical situations for her characters -- and making them seem not only believable but unevitable. The characterization is stronger than is generally realized; Scarlett, Rhett, and Ashley all have layers of complexity that far more ""literary"" novels often fail to create. It's part of pop culture, and American culture, and for all its flaws and frustrations, an endlessly enjoyable and memorable read."
4,Gone with the wind,"I finally had the time to read this wonderful book! Wordy, long and descriptive, just what I enjoy in a good read. I know I will read it again and again! A true classic!"
2,Love the STORY but book fell apart,"Gone With the Wind is one of my favorite novels, and I previously owned it only in paperback, so purchased this hardback just over a year ago. I read it after purchasing it, and then it went on a bookshelf. When I brought it back down to let my daughter read it, she commented that the pages were coming out, and sure enough they were. The glue in the binding has lost all of its stickiness and the pages are all completely coming out. What a HUGE disappointment after the money spent. I was better off with my paperback. Do NOT buy this format of the book."
3,Not as enjoyable as the movie,"but it works, mainly because of Scarlett and Ashley, who are engaging if limited characters. Rhett Butler begins as interesting but is ultimately tiresome. Mammy is engaging, Prissy less so. The less said about Melanie and Ellen the better. Don't count on it as history lesson, either. Really, it's not much more than a well written bodice ripper (which explains why it has so many adolescent fans) but bodice rippers are often fun."
5,perfect story,One of the greatest american epic stories of all time and one of the only books to ever be correctly adapted to the silver screen. Scarlet is a wonderful character as is Rhett. The only thing you could wish for is a slightly better ending.
5,Gone with the wind,"When I first read this book a year ago, I fell in love with it.i really enjoyed everything about this book. I cant tell you witch parts i like more.This is the type of book that should be read by everybody!"
1,the truth critic,i absolutely hate this book!!!!!!!!!! i read at a pace of roughly 100 pages in twenty miutes and it took me over six months to finish this book. its hard to get into scarlet is a self cantered brat its unbearably boring and i just flat out want to buy the actual book and burn it!!!!!!!! i am very sorry if this offends anyone... i am sure that margaret michell is a great author but i just cant stand this book...i try my best not to bash any books but i just had to on this one. please forgive me but that is my opinion
1,Totally Lame,I only subjected myself to one half of the free sample. That people could regard this as a great novel is beyond my comprehension. I will not be buying the complete file.John BeyerleinLiz & Dick
5,gone ....,One of the best novels I've ever read. Margaret Mitchell has a way of bringing the reader into a tumulus period in the United States history. Near 1000 pages but easy to read and informative to what Southerners went through. Should be required reading in high schools of the U.S.
5,Story telling at its best,"I wish Margaret Mitchell had written more than one book. She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!"
5,One of the best!,"Probably one of the very greatest fiction books of all time. Ms. Mitchell wrote a classic here with all the details of the Civil War enmeshed with Scarlett O'Hara and her tempetuous personality. Made into the movie in 1939 (and won the Best Picture Oscar that year), the book offers no disappointments. A true classic!"
5,An extremaly long and extremely good book.,This book is for those people who can't stand when a good book to come to an end. Also for those who like romance and loved the movie. You don't have to have seen the movie though to enjoy the book.
5,A legacy in it's 3rd (4th?) Generation,"My mother read this book when she was 13. I read it when I was 13. I don't have a daughter, but if I did, I'd surely present her with a copy of this when she reached ""the age"". Has your daughter read it? Don't settle for just the movie (although that's wonderful, too)! Read it!"
5,Captivating,"This book moved me because it was full of spontaneous adventure and valuable lessons. Margrett Mitchell not only wrote on romance and love, but also on the very real issues of a woman's place, jealousy, loyalty, and respect. Scarlett is the ideal stong and independent woman. She did not need men for their money and protection; she needed them for more suitable reasons like love and comfort. The entire novel was a lovely and inspiring story with twists of all kinds. I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wonderful read."
5,A Wonderful Book!,"This book was wonderful. I love reading about the south and the Civil War era is a wonderful back drop for the story of the spoiled southern belle Scarlett, and the dashing Rhett. I personally feel that this book is the mother of historical romance and will last the test of time. I read this book the first time when I was 12 or 13 and re-read it again as an adult. My memory of this story was not altered by the length of time between these reads.Better then the movie and wonderfully descriptive with real characters that grow as a result of their experiences you will not be disappointed with this book."
4,great book. . . where's the love story?,"I loved this book. Very dramatic, great story. However, not having ever seen the movie or read the book, I was expecting a love story. Isn't it called the best love story of our time? They never fell in love! However disappointed, the book was great, well written, a great story. . . not a love story."
5,Gone With the Wind,I never tire of reading Gone with the Wind. I just preferred to read the hard back this time.
3,HARD TO GET THROUGH THE BOOK,"I'M FINDING IT VERY HARD TO KEEP READING THE BOOK. I EXPECTED IT TO BE EVEN BETTER THAN THE MOVIE; BUT SO FAR, I'M STRUGGLING TO KEEP READING"
3,Gone With The Wind,"I am just really getting started reading Gone With The Wind, so don't feel I have a real handle on the story as of yet. It is good enough to keep me reading and not lose interest."
5,Favorite Book of All Time,"I, TOO, am a literary snob. But I have to say, I had to go back again and read this much-loved book of my younger years -- well, only 5 years ago. But I relayed this heart-felt literary love of mine to my other great hardcover friends, Tawney and Marie (one, a long-time member of the illustrious Corduroy Club/Manhattan chapter), and they immediately nodded and tilted their heads at my cerebral connection to this masterpiece. I hope that we all, including myself (after countless other reads, good and bad, achievements and not so much of sad, downwardly-glanced works, but I digress) revisit this delightful glance at a telling of history that few these days pause to the written word. I commend my fellow apprecianados. Life - let it be lived."
4,AMAZING ALBUM,"I REALLY WANT TO GIVE THIS ALBUM A 4 AND HALF THE RESON WHY I DID'T GIVE IT A 5 IS ALL THE SKIT'S, THEY WERE FUNNY BUT HE DID'T NEED ALL THOSE SKIT'S BUT OVER ALL THE ALBUM IS GOOD MY FAV TRACKS OR GOOD OL LOVE PRODUCED BY 9TH WONDER I THINK 9TH WONDER IS THE TRUTH AND I LOVE THE SONGS CALL DA GRAND, PRODUCED BY KRYSIS ANOTHER JUSTUS LEUGUE CAT FROM A GROUP CALLED THE AWAY TEAM, SO UNDERGROUND HEADS ANOTHER ALBUM TO BANG IN THE 04 THAT'S NICE."
5,Long Hot Summer,"This album is my longest lasting CD still on changer rotation from this summer. Lyrics and beats are tight throughout, even the skits are addicting.Buy it and recommend it... Everyone I've turned on to it bought it. Nuff said."
5,wow,"this album, no lie, is top 3 of 2004. i wish more people knew about him and this cd. this would BLOW UP if it ever hit the radios. I promise u with every penny u spend on this CD, its worth it. there isn't one bad song on it. ITS BETTER THEN KANYE! haha. trust me, go get it."
3,What happened???,"This was the 4th Italian prog cd I ever purchased. After buying the 1st two PFM cds and being blown away, I was disapointed with Le Orme's Contrappunti and this, and gave up on the Italian scene for a couple of years (I know, I gave up too soon). Looking back I would have to rate this as far inferior to PFM's first two, but not as bad as I originally thought. I think the biggest thing is that not understanding Italian it is harder to differentiate between the songs than on english language albums, and when every song on the album doesn't work, it is harder to appreciate what does. The best italian albums flow together as one linked work. This PFM release doesn't do that. As other have mentioned, the opening chorus, and the english sung Is My Face on Straight are throwaways, but the last two songs, the beautiful ballad Dolcissima Maria and the fusion influenced Via Lumiere are very good. So, this does have its moments, but is nowhere near as complete as Storia and Per un Amico"
4,PFM - Another Good One,"This album was also released in the US under a different title with English lyrics. This is another solid album from PFM. Lots of great guitar on this one and the keyboard loam large over all of it. PFM fans seem to rate this one a bit lower than the band's first few discs, but I would say I like it about equally. Once again with the Italian lyrics I don't have a clue what it is all about, but suffice to say that this is another PFM album well worth owning."
4,"A great album, but with a key song missing","This is the Italian version of PFM's best album, ""The World Became the World,"" one of the greatest progressive rock albums ever. However, ""The World Became the World"" and ""Four Holes in the Ground"" (""La Luna Nuova"") were the centerpieces of the English version. Because ""The World..."" had already appeared in Italy (as ""Impressioni di Settembre"") on PFM's first album, ""Storia di un Minuto"", it is not included here, and that lessens the overall impact of the album. However, the title cut, ""La Luna Nuova"", and ""Is My Face On Straight?"" are all excellent, innovative pieces. The album also includes the pleasant ballad ""Dolcissima Maria"" and an instrumental."
1,It didn't work and spoilt my coffee maker as well,"Well, I am pretty disappointed with this prodcut as it spoilt my new Krups coffee maker as well. Its supposed to take loads of upto 1600 Watts but my 1200 Watt coffee maker was apparently too much for it to handle."
1,Unsafe,Go to Radio Shack for this. The converter overheated as it was plugged in and sparked upon connecting the appliance to it (well within the 1600 watts specs). It fortunately burned out prior to damaging anything. Definitely an unsafe product from my point of view. No UL or CE approvals stamped on it.
5,What's that buzzing?,"Jeff Gundy's first three volumes of poetry established that he was a writer curious to discover the country that lies just beyond our field of vision. In Deerflies, Gundy continues to seek out this reality--which at times he might name as the face of God--in the most ordinary of moments. His is a poetry in which we are asked to question perspective. One moment he may implore us to imagine what the redwinged blackbird sees; in another he may turn a sacred story on its head, suggesting that if we were not infused with the myths of this place we might see the world in very different terms; and still at other times we are privy to conversations between the likes of Simone Weil and Hermann Hesse, somehow resurrected long after their deaths. Deerflies is a book of strong poems and quiet meditations. It rewards us in its artfulness, but, perhaps more importantly, it rewards us with its philosophical humilty, its devotion to the possibility of redemption, and its great good heart."
3,"An okay tape, but could be better.","RHYTHM AND WEEP is the funniest short here. I think it has some funny scenes, especially when the Stooges are about to jump off the building. Too many dancing scenes though. BACK FROM THE FRONT was okay, but not great. Moe does his Hitler impression also done in all three shorts on the THEY STOOGE TO CONGA tape. Good toward the end. THE THREE TROUBLEDOERS was just too boring. There are a few funny scenes, but not enough. I don't usually like westerns.An okay tape, but nothing special."
2,"Careful, Curly fans.","Curly fans will see very little of their hero's usual personality. Two of these shorts date from 1946, when Curly Howard was at the end of his career. (Very ill at the time, he struggled through these films and it shows.) RHYTHM AND WEEP is the better of the two, with the Stooges auditioning their song-and-dance act for a producer. THE THREE TROUBLEDOERS is a Western spoof that Curly just wasn't up to making. BACK FROM THE FRONT is a wartime comedy with the Stooges doing their best to sabotage the German war effort. Completists will want these episodes, but they aren't prime Stooge material."
3,No classics on this tape. Funny if you are a stooge fanatic.,"Cleverness of gags - 3 stars.New stuff - 1 star.all three episodes are average stooge shorts.I love these guys, but these are not in the first tier of Stooge skits, in spite of many neat Curly antics. I laughed out loud often.(When I watch the real classics, I laugh until I am breathless. Not here.)"
5,IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!,"GETZ RECORDED WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED ALBUMS, AND I'D RATE THIS ONE AMONG THE BEST OF HIS BEST. I'VE WRITTEN THREE TRANSCRIPTION BOOKS ON STAN GETZ'S MUSIC, AND THIS ALBUM IS AS EXCITING ON THE 10,000TH LISTENING AS IT IS ON THE FIRST!! IT'S A GREAT REPRESENTATION OF LATE 1950'S GETZ STYLE BEFORE THE BOSSA NOVA PERIOD."
5,Classic Jazz,"This is an oldie but so very enjoyable to listen to. I have a copy of my own, and bought this one for a friend for a Christmas present."
5,Great rythym section,"As a jazz guitar player, i personally love stan getz, and to hear him with ray brown, one of my favorite and greatest bass players ever. This was also the first i have listened to Herb Ellis play, his parts are a bit quiet but hey all guitarist were quiet until Charlie Christian. All in Four Really great musicians playing together, if you like this , check out russell malone, ray brown and monty alexander's Cd."
5,Rememberence of Swing Past,"Now that the men who collaborated in this session 50 years ago have passed away, this disk provides memories of jazz artists who will never be heard from any other way. Their unique style ic as classic as classical music."
5,Ashley Miller's Review,This collection of poems by Mary Ann Coleman is wonderful. She has a special way of making the simplest detail in nature awe-inspiring. The illustrations are stunning! I highly recommend it to children and adults alike.
5,Wonderful,"What can I say,this is just simply a beautiful collection of poems. Sometimes I go outside, read one and just sink into the loveliness of the wild around me. These poems just really are beautiful. Lots of great imagery in the writing such that you can almost hear and smell the images the writer is conveying. Very well done. The last poem is about Hummingbirds the rest are about other animals/aspects of nature. Highly recommended"
4,Very nice everyday lotion!,"This lotion is a another great Bella B product. I love this product as my everyday lotion. It's especially nice after shaving. I usually itch pretty badly but when I use this after shaving I don't itch and my skin feels lovely. I use this in the morning on my arms, chest, and neck and I only have to apply it one time and I'm moisturized for the entire day. A nice light fragrance and it soaks in rather well. I personally love it!"
3,Nice but absorbs weird,"I was really excited to try this lotion. It sounded like exactly what I needed for my 7 month pregnant belly and body. It smells great and goes on nice but I have found that it doesn't really seem to absorb. It sits on top of my skin and later in the day it creates an odd waxy film that flakes off. I have found the Earth Mama, Angel Baby products to be better."
5,very Real,I couldn't put this Book down it dealt with so many subjects&Challenged the Reader into thinking of so thoughts within the Context of Race&class.I Applaud the Author for the Direct Honesty&letting everything hang out&Open.it's a strong testimony of Her Overcoming&dealing with the Cards She was dealt with in Life&finding Her place&Voice in this Society.
1,not satisfied,"i would not recommend this book for anyone who is intereseted in identifying the trees in the field. Its organised according to species names and is very inconvininet to use. A classification basedon leaves, colors and fruits will be more useful."
4,Low price - good product,"Good product for the price. Better than Inksel. Not as good as new cartridges, but I get a good print for home use."
2,Don't be fooled by the release date!,"I was looking for something current and informative on designer wine; the release date says 2008 but the footage suggests this was produced in the 70s or 80s. Overall, rather disappointing and just a tad bit boring to watch."
4,good but need to realize its not perfect.,"This book is often right on in what it says. It often gives you a very accurate account of what could happen, however it is not always right, and when people are not typical of their sign, it skews what can happen..the bottom line: it's very interesting but not the perfect predictor. It should be taken lightly."
4,Fun and entertaining book for budding astrologers.,"A nice light read for those who want to know something about relationship astrology and don't want to be bogged down with too much detail.Its a humorous and truthful book but a littlelacking in compassion. Some of the jibes at sun-signs are quite mean. Although I liked thebook, I found some relationship analysis toopessimistic and lacking in positive suggestions for improving things."
5,High stakes plot. A Gripping tale!,"This is one of the most incredibly tender and believable books I've ever read, even as it grips you in suspense. One of my favorite scenes was where Gabe and Selena discuss what would happen if he were to attend the ball. It was so amusing, poigniant and believable. I loved it.This book contains a wealth of wonderful reading, like the scene where Gabe and Selena are declaring their love, unbeknownst to each other. It evokes tears and soul-deep compassion for these two ""very real"" characters.Sharon's skill was really shining in this book; her logic in how the plot played out was dead-on and kept me turning those pages as if I were eating the book.The climax was full of tension and suspense, the ending beautiful and satisfying. I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a great story line and characters who will be long-remembered. Sharon Gillenwater is an outstanding writer. I can't wait to read more. -Lee Emory"
3,OK Only,A couple of the stories were quite good but some weren't so great. I did finish the book so it kept my interest but I was disappointed.
4,Momentary Relief from Real Life,Romance writers know how to fantasize and then put their imaginations on paper with extraordinary flair. Six of them make this compilation of skin tingling stories possible to be consumed by particular group of readers. The title of the collection is appropriate although the short narrations of attractions and entanglements could be savored more before turning in at night. Leave it to one's mind to be tickled by the fantasies where sweet dreams take over as the eyes closed shut after a long grueling day. Each story is a dilly.
3,"Not as good as the ""Bad Boys"" series","I agree with the only other reviewer at this time, that most of the stories fall far short of typical good, steamy anthologies.Only the story of the ER doc and the Lifeguard was good, but I think it works only well as a short story.All in all I would reccomend the first 3 ""Bad Boys""eries instead or ""All Through The Night"" which has the first of 3 stories by Lori Foster (the second two are played out in ""I Love Bad Boys"" and ""I Brake for Bad Boys"")"
2,.,This book was just not for me. I don't see the sun let alone the beach...that should have been my first clue.
3,Do Not Buy! Unless you have the DX,"Let me be clear, this manga, along with all other graphic novels is useless on the regular 6"" kindle! Books in comic format cannot have text enlarged, to make matters worse, the way each page displays, it leaves an inch of blank border around each page to accomodate the page counter. This is a great book, but be sure to buy it in paperback format. I don't have a DX, but I would imagine that having one would make this book a lot easier to read."
2,tr,I got this book for my e-reader because I thought it would be a fun way to learn. It said the text to speech was enabled but it isn't. This would be helpful while trying to read on a small screen. and it is always easier to learn another language when you can hear it.
1,Kindle version inefficient display,"This comment is not about the content but the way it is being rendered on a 6"" Kindle.The content could have been ""stretched"" so that it utilizes the whole screen which in turn makes the text more ""readable"""
3,Okay,It's a small book. Not sure how effective it will be to teach japanese by glancing at it. Got it for my son for xmas.
3,Kanji De Manga Volume 1,This is a great book for learning to write and read Japanese. I like the manga too. It is very helpful.
4,Mind of an elusive fighter,"Anita Pratap gives an exclusive view of LTTE and its leader, Mr.Prabhakaran. There is no journalist other than Anita that has so much access to LTTE and have given an inside look into the mind of world's most elusive man, Prabhakarn. She has taken extreme step to visit all the hot spots of the Indian Subcontinent. Her instincts about LTTE were correct when she met them in 1986."
3,"Pardon Me, May I Borrow A Cup Of Spinal Fluid?...","Yes, the ""ape"" make-up is utterly ridiculous. The whole getup makes poor Bela look like an amish Elvis-impersonator w/ a bad back! Still, the movie is watchable and short enough to remain fun. Dr. Brewster (Bela) has gone and turned himself into an ape-man, complete w/ savage grunts and go-rilla walk. He doesn't like what he's become, and decides to change himself back to normal. Uh-oh, it seems that in order to do this, Brewster needs injections of human spinal fluid! Of course, this forces him (and his shabby go-rilla companion) to go on a nightly killing spree. This movie is almost a good parody of Lugosi's classic, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. Directed by William Beaudine, there wasn't much hope from the start, but APE-MAN is goofy enough to see at least once..."
1,"the transfer wasn't very good,but then nether is the movie","i have this same movie on three other collections and it's so good that i forgot about it,and bought this one! really thats what happened,so remember i may be slow. two of my three look better than this one,and they have more movies on them. really check out some of the collections out there and you'll find better prints of this movie."
1,Hilariously bad horror film,"This cheapie Monogram flick produced by Sam (""Never lost a buck because he never spent a buck"")Katzman looks like it was written by script writers bombed out of their minds on cheap whiskey. This is not Lugosi's worst film (Ed Wood was yet to come along) but it probably comes close. Make sure you're a little intoxicated while watching this, it may heighten your enjoyment. Or you can go on a tremendous ego trip, snickering and sneering at every turn of the plot. 1 1/2 stars."
2,Uniquely silly Forties horror.,"The only thing that saves this effort from a one-star rating is its enjoyable silliness, which is pretty extreme even for poverty row Forties horror flicks. This time, Bela Lugosi is ""Dr. Brewster"" (yet another Anglo-Saxon name for the exotic Hungarian!), whose unholy experiments with apes have given him a face-encircling beard, a slouching gait, and a tendency to sleep in a cage with his pet gorilla. He needs fresh spinal fluid (human only, please) to restore him to normal, so many complications ensue. His only ally is his sympathetic sister (Minerva Urecal), who addresses him as ""you poor boy!"" (Lugosi was about 60 at the time.) The film was aparently not even intended to be taken seriously, which is its one small saving grace. Even Lugosi is not as charismatic as usual."
3,A classic by Beaudine & Katzman.,"A Monogram/Banner classic co-produced by Sam Katzman and directed by the one and only William Beaudine. Bela Lugosi is Dr. Brewster who has experimented with spinal fluids from a gorilla on himself. He is now slowly transforming to an ape himself and starts to regret what he has done. So Dr. Brewster and his pet gorilla (!) goes out killing people to get human spinal fluid so he can be cured. This is just as stupid as it sounds, and the film has a total lack of logic. But it's a fun and entertaining movie if you are into the genre of old horrors from the 40's. Well worth a look."
2,Monogram Mayhem,"Bela Lugosi makes the most of this Monogram Pictures mediocrity, directed by the immortal William ""One Shot"" Beaudine. ""The Ape Man"" (1943) remains a silly attempt at tragic horror, but Lugosi shines in the shabbiest of surroundings. There are worse ways to spend 64 minutes. Interestingly enough, Bela's apelike makeup is similar to the Sayer of the Law in ""Island of Lost Souls"" (1932)."
4,London/WW II and being beautiful and deaf?,"The plot is marvelous the characters are endearing. A love story of a deaf girl and a pilot,this is a novel of love and war and writting so you will not put it down till you know the end... Love this book ,if your a romantic. Reading it you will feel the anguish of being deaf in a world gone mad. It is a truly different kind of war/romance .. A++"
5,Excellent Buy,"This cable arrived early and exactly as advertised. I used them for the installation I had in mind, and they are working just fine. Great Buy."
4,Works as intended,"The build quality of the cable is good, works as intended. Handles gigabit network speeds without issue, would buy again."
3,Not as advertised,"Photo makes it look like fleece extends over back of saddle, when in reality it is just a cheap mesh substance. The fleece covering the front of the saddle appears much more generous than it actually is. Quality is not very cushy, either. Save your money and put it toward a good one if you need the padding."
1,Not enough information.,"What they fail to outline in the specifications is that if you don't have the factory installed connector underneath this gizmo will not be able to hook up. Your truck may have a towing package but not this connector, and I am not talking about the four way pin connector, but a multi-pin connector. I bought this for nothing."
3,Poor quality video,"Before putting this video on sale some enhancement should have been done to the original film. It is good only for its historic value, but the quality of the film is extremely poor."
2,Gift wrap and package wrap by Amazon was flimsy; fell apart.,"I purchased this book as a gift. The wrapping for the book and the package that Amazon used was flimsy, and fell apart. The gift was a mess when it arrived. In spite of paying for gift wrapping and for shipping, Amazon failed to provide either adequately."
3,"Scholarly, but little more than a pamphlet","Well written and cohesive, but it's a scholarly analysis, lacking in emotional appeal, and a brief one at that. I'm not an exceptionally fast reader, but I finished it in less than two hours (and it put me to sleep once for about 15 minutes during that time). Almost a third of the book is references and tables.On the plus side, I agree with the conclusions drawn by Professor Overy and find no flaw in his logic or in his analysis of a very well studied subject. Words like succinct and concise come to mind."
1,i like salif,i like the song of salif that why i look for one of his like les ambassadeurs international with salif keita
4,Great listening experience & intro to Bill...,"This is a compilation that covers Bill Evans in many different musical combinations and moods, and probably is the best single-disc overview of his 1960's work anyone could have come up with. It is my first Evans purchase, although I have known of him for 40 years. I delight in this. It rewards repeated listening. If you like jazz piano, it is definitely an ""essential."" What he does with the Tony Bennett classic ""Who Can I Turn To?"" is amazing and addictive."
5,great overview,This book really covers everything there is to know about the nuts and bolts of an agency. If it had a more sophisticated creative/interactive media section it would be even better. Its written in a engaging way entertaining for both novice's and seasoned exec's alike. Good Creativity books are hard to find. This is one of the better ones.
5,A Window Into the Future of our Economy and Your Money,"This is one of the first books published which gives you a real look through the window of the future of our economy. The author, with years of experience in reporting how advertising effects our purchasing choices, offers an expert's point of view of advertising, which drives our economy. It effects everyone. It deals with how people will respond to advertising in this century (i.e. television, print media, the Internet) and how it will effect us. My broker said this book was more important than the ones he recommended about investing. We are all consumers experiencing an incredible transition from t.v. to cable, from cable to satellite, from magazine and newspaper ads to e-mail and Internet ads? If you want security what could be more important than to know what's going to happen to commercials on t.v., the web, or ads that inform you of sales and discounts in your local newspaper?"
2,Casting for Big Ideas: A New Manifesto for Agency Managers,"This book is not intersesting, not helpful and not informative. There are a lot of great books on advertising and marketing, this is not one of them. I have spent the past 15 years in the advertising business and I can honsetly say I did not learn anything new from reading this book."
5,Uncommon,"Once more, Celibidache makes us look at a warhorse in quite a different way. And it's a way that is very much more revelatory and inspiring. I whole-heartedly recommend this recording for the seasoned Beethoven student."
2,Not for every taste.,"I'm not into this eccentric approach of this major work. After having a long tradition of superb recordings of thissymphony by Karajan (1963), Fricsay, Furtwängler, Abendroth and Bernstein (DG), this Celi bizarre reading could be a bitof shocking to anyone. If you are fond of a weird phrasing and tempi, deliberate rubato and bizarre unbalance, this couldbe your perfect choice."
4,ITs a great story...,"Its a really interesting clash of cultures. Here you have Boris Spassky, from the more structured USSR, being the more cultured and open person. On the other side you have Fischer, the brash spoiled egotist coming from the USA making ultimatums and demands that threaten the very championships he wanted to attain. You would think it would be the other way around, but once you get into reading the book, you realize that this was about so much more than just a couple of chess games in Reykjavik.A very enlightening, quick read. For those who don't know much about chess or even want to know, the authors to an exceptional job at downplaying the actual games and making important points only when necessary--and when they do they describe it in such terms anyone could understand."
4,Answers the questions.,"I was eleven when Fischer won the world championship. It was electrifying, he was a hero to many of us. Fischer had an aura, a mystique that enhanced American chess. After winning the championship, within three years he was gone. Dozens of stories about him floated around the world. This book effectively and comprehensively answers all the questions so many of us had for decades regarding Bobby Fischer.The authors have completely researched his life from birth to today. Almost as exhaustive is their history on Spassky. The ins and outs of the championship tournament in Iceland are fascinating, but the high level of chronological research, the interplay between the players and those around them make this book unforgettable."
4,"Quick, entertaining read, but. . . .","I did enjoy reading this book, and would recommend it to anyone interested in either chess or history (particularly Cold War American-Soviet relations). One problem I have with the book is that there wasn't enough detail in the descriptions of the games themselves. I know detailed anaysis of chess moves or strategy could slow the book down (to non-chess lovers), but the competition between these two men are at the heart of the text.The real problem may be that the authors sell the book as ""Bobby Fischer"" going to war, but we are unable to get any insight into Fischer's motivations or true feelings because of his insane behavior. I use the word insane intentionally.As I stated before, read this book. You will enjoy it because it is well written and entertaining. I just wanted a little more chess."
3,Great Chess Book!!! Buy and Read Today,"I loved reading this book. Very exciting. Bobby Fischer against the world (at least in his head). I rate this book as three stars, I like ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" much more (five stars). They never found Bobby in Searching for Bobby Fischer but this book, Bobby Fishcer Goes to War does an excellent job of documenting his strategies and the internal makeup of what caused his internal war inside. I recommend you but this book today."
4,Interesting,"This is the story of the epic 1972 World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer ( the chess genius and challenger ) and Boris Spassky ( the Champion ). The authors began with a short description of both players' childhoods, explored their respective paths to Iceland and then focus on the build-up to the match including the incessant demands of Fischer.Fischer emerged as the champion but Spassky emerged the gentleman. The writing is breezy and it is obvious the authors have done a lot of research. If you are interested in an analysis of the games this book is not for you.This book focus on the drama of the match."
2,Ended up not liking Bobby Fischer,I must respect Bobby Fischer as a player. But I learned some stuff that doesn't make me respect him as a person. I have read more things about Fischer which this book leaves out and should have been put in.
2,Caveat emptor!,"I was very disappointed in this publication -- ""slim for the money"" is something of an understatement in my opinion. A dozen saddle-stapled legal-size xeroxes doth not a trade paperback make, really, and much of the information can be had on the 'net for free. The sketches are amateurish at best, confusing at worst. I'd never EVER sent an order back to Amazon.com -- until now.There're /much/ better texts on the subject available right here at Amazon.com; I'd advise saving your money for those rather than spending on this."
4,Great for Those who don't sew much,"I found this book to be most helpful for those who do not sew a whole lot. The sketches are pretty straight forward, and the instructions easy to understand."
3,A good beginner guide,"This slim booklet will help a beginner dancer plan and construct her first dance costume. All the necessary costume considerations are included. Simple garment patterns are illustrated with line drawings and the sewing instructions are easy to follow. Embellishment techniques are briefly outlined to give the beginner an idea of how to decorate the base costume components. The book would really benefit from more professional illustrations or photographs of finished costumes but overall, it is an inexpensive starter book for anyone attempting to make their first belly dance costume."
2,wrong one,"They sent me a Drill Doctor DA31325GF 100 Grit Sharpening Wheelby Drill Doctor instead of the Drill Doctor SA01751PA 1/2"" - 3/4"" Large Chuck. I don't know how to get hold of anyone."
2,Review of book,"This book was highly informative about Irish wedding customs, but I was looking for more of ""hints"" of what to do for a traditional wedding, not why these traditions are in place. It wasn't the type of book I was looking for in wedding planning."
4,"A good listen, even for an old guy (39)","I first was introduced to this music when I watched Steve Martin's movie The Shopgirl. It had a couple of really magnetic tunes by Mark Kozelek that made me dig until I found Red House Painters - Retrospective. While not the same upbeat vibe as the songs in the movie, this collection of haunting, peaceful lingering music will slow you down like ether and and won't let you go - much like the traffic jam in the opening sequence of Office Space. My favorite is Mistress. Try Sun Kill Moon for a change of pace and more lively flavor."
5,You should own this one!,"Amazing tracks from one of the greatest songwriters of our generation. Mark Kozelek treats a song like a unjudging best friend. He tells all with no hesitation. If you're looking for new tracks, check out Shanti Project Collection which contains three."
3,Talented Band,"Romantic songs with half baked adolescent poetry. Occassionally very beautiful, but sometimes just plain annoying. Talented band, but an uneven collection of songs."
4,exceptionally simple and conversational.,"a rewrite of the original version which was destroyed before published, it's astonishingly reader-friendly...for a book on psychology. It includes some light humour which are both entertaining and relaxing on a rather heavy topic; the writer constantly puts in mind his reader being musicians or even his students from his past. A great book overall. Definitely enjoyable."
2,Not sure who this book was written for...,"After reading the other reviews about this book, I thought that it'd be a handy reference guide to add to my collection. I'm an experienced web developer and already know how style sheets work and how to use them - I just wanted a book where I could quickly look up specific syntax, etc.This book definitely doesn't work for that - the index is sorely lacking and the information isn't well-organized at all. So, since a lot of the other reviewers wrote that this book isn't for beginners (I agree) and, since I'm an experienced developer and it's not working for me, I'm not sure who would find this book useful. Especially when there are so many other CSS books to choose from.....Normally O'Reilly books are really good, so I'm a little bit surprised that they published this book without having an editor clean it up and organize it. In any case, I would not recommend this book, period. I'm glad that my employer paid for it and not me. ;-)"
3,"Dispassionate, traditional Beethoven, if that's what you like","Wolfgang Sawallisch became a house conductor for EMI in the mono era over fifty years ago; he made these Beethoven symphony recordings in his twilight years with the Concertgebouw. The Eroica and First Sym. from 1996 could be from 1956. Tempos tend to be relaxed, a bit slow, the tension pulled back. But such an approach, despite its traditional virtues of balance and good taste, would have been considered second-rate even back then. Just because you've entered your twilight doesn't mean you've gotten better, and the old Sawallisch sounds quite dull. The best moments come in the light-textured, almost deliate treatment of the faster movements in Sym. #1, #2, and #8. Even he cana't prevent the Concertgebouw from playing beautifully. That, and the low price may make this EMI two-fer attractive to you."
5,The Cirterion Collection is the best,Great great great movie. Just the right pacing and always keeps you interested and watching.The best extra on the DVD is the commentary by a Japanese Cinema expert ... all kinds of insightful information.
4,Akira Kurosawa's Masterpiece on DVD,"My only regret was that this DVD is not available on bluray.Excellent transfer onto DVD though, and the subtitles are terrific and very easy to understand.The DVD comes with a booklet with very interesting and for myself, hard-to-find information and rare snippets from the master Kurosawa himself and Toshiro Mifune.Well worth the price!"
5,A Magnificent Epic,"One criterion by which I judge films is how many times I look at my watch. During the three hours plus that this film runs, I didn't look at my watch even once. The characterizations and the and the pacing are among the finest I've ever seen. SEVEN SAMURAI is not about a quaint period in Japanese history; it is about the complexity of human nature. It's on my ""Ten Best Films of All Time"" list."
5,Seven Stars for Seven Samurai,"This is quite possibly the most believeable movie of all time. There is such a deep sense that these actors are real villagers in true peril. The samurai, exude class and brilliance FAR beyond anything seen in The Magnificent Seven. Cinematography has a very wide range, as do the characters and depth of feeling. A true classic."
5,A classic...,"Kurosawa is one of my favorite directors, and ""Seven Samurai"" is one of the few 3-hour films I have the patience to sit through. The sets, the music, the actors - eveything comes together. But I prefer other Kurosawa films to this, after seeing it a few times I think it's kind of cheesy, but the final battle scene in the rain is extremely well done. Many movies have attempted to copy the plot (Magnificent Seven) but this is the original - see it before you see the others and none will live up to this."
3,Seven Samuari ('54) vs The Magnificent Seven ('60),"I purchased ""Seven Samuari"" because I have always enjoyed ""The Magnificent Seven"" even after multiple viewings and reviewers always helpfully point out that the latter is a Hollywood reinterpretation of the storyline. So I wondered what the original was like and anyway as a child I had always enjoyed watching ""Shintaro"" on TV.First of all, I did enjoy ""Seven Samuari"" for itself, but can hardly believe there was only six years between production of it and ""The Manificent Seven"", which is decades ahead visually. I thought the recruitment period was laboured in ""Samuari"" and generally the whole film seened to drag a bit. Maybe ""Samuari"" also suffered in that I was only familiar with Toshiro Mifune whereas ""Magnificent"" was chock full of A-list stars.I think ""Seven Samuari"" is well worth the look, especially if you are into the genre. It's just that ""The Magnificent Seven"" was magnificent."
3,Meh,"Does not feel as long as total minutes suggest. Not much meat though. Some moments of mature human relationships. Some fine cinematography (in woods) and dialectic scene construction (graveyard finale), with good musical effects throughout. Otherwise, notable for how idiotic the farmers are, like lemmings, and the crying/despairing men (reminds me of Ranma 1/2). Not a bad movie, but not memorable or endearing to me. A few slim but interesting views of peasant architecture and hygiene, and a few scenes of old style agriculture with music (planting out rice seedlings)."
2,The template,"Like many of Akira Kurosawas films this is a template for basic storytelling that has been referenced, borrowed or used over and over again. Truely a masterpiece."
2,Might have been profound for it's time but...,"When I pay almost 30. for a DVD I expect alot, especially from a criterion edition. Seven Samurai does not reflect truly what a DVD is all about...which is high quality video, great sound and unique whistles and bells that are added value. True, an older movie can be discribed as a profound auteur venture for it's time, but for the quality of sound, picture and aspect ratio...I in retrospect would have been just as happy with a video and would have not worried about the video commentaries. My advice...go rent the video before deciding to purchase this one. If you're dying to see it again and again after that, (which I doubt) pick up the DVD. Sorry, in my book...if I'm not going to watch it more than 3x why pay the convenience for a classic when it has the screen resolution of a Disney flip-book?"
2,One for the purist.,"While Seven Samurai contains great acting and brave direction (not many directors would use such long pauses in dialogue and action in a movie, a style used hear to powerful affect) I found over three hours difficult to get through. The plot is a simple one, and could have been told as completely in a much shorter length film. If like me, you are a lover of film watching, rather than a lover of film making, don't expect too much from Seven Samurai."
2,Must be understood to be watched...?,"Watching the 'direction' in this movie, and others by this director, is like seeing the first ever 'lace-up' shoe or the first ever internal-combustion engine. You may happen to appreciate that the 'overused' ideas, employed in the film, were used there for the first time; the originality pervading the movie from beginning to end alongside gritty and convincing acting. However, it is still subject to a style of story-delivery that was original 50 years ago - that modern film watchers are jaded with.To avoid a long spiel: if you hate black and white; if long silent scenes with no music overplay; if obscured scenes and dramatic angles are not your thing, you just won't enjoy this film. No matter how much of a masterpiece it is. Know your limits, people. And stick to Titanic. This film isn't for you. Now go. Leave.PS: (...)"
5,great,I got exactly what was described. The disc was a little scratched up as are most used DVDs but I had no problem while watching it. Came a lot faster then was expected so that was also a plus.I jst wish it came in a actual box instead of a cardboard sliver.
5,great film and Amazon has the best price!,I wanted to buy Seven Samurai 3 Disc Edition for the longest time and have been searching web and stores for prices. Amazon.com has the lowest price! All other sites/stores wanted $50+ for this. Thank you Amazon for a great deal!
5,"Sean ""Dragon Ninja"", I suggest that you drop dead","This is the best film ever. Nothing i say could drive that home anymore, and if you haven't bought this movie yet,then just drive to the store and pick it up. I would like to express my hatred of the individual known as Sean ""Dragon Ninja."" He should not be able to review films, because he obviously never even made it out of grade school. So all I can say to you Mr. Dragon Ninja is: EAT SHI# AND DIE. You call yourself a ninja, how pathetic."
5,The heart is stronger than the sword,"This movie is not to be missed. Kurasawa had an eye for many things, but he saw the essence of compassion best. 'Seven Samurai' gives us spectacular action sequences, but more importantly, it gives us a glance into the human heart."
5,Incredible film,"This is juat an incredible film. Upon learning that their village is going to be plundered, a community of peasants decides to try to enlist the help of some samurai to defend them. With nothing to offer them but food, a couple of peasants go out in search of some ""hungry"" samurai. The samurai that enlist each do so for their own reasons, but they all come together to defend the village from the raiders. The characters, acting, and story all make this a fantastic film. It clocks in at over 3 hours, but doesn't seem that long. And even though it's all in Japanese and subtitled in english, you wont mind!One complaint however: this DVD will only play in one of my three DVD players (I have a Toshiba, a Sony, and a Memorex DVD-RW, and it only plays in the Sony)."
5,IN MY OPINION THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE,"I've loved this movie since the first time i saw it. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie - Action, great acting, Romance, and a cast of characters that you will be absolutely captivated with. The directors excellent choices of landscapes and beautiful scenery as well as his excellent sense of timing and mood in weather. You can't go wrong with this movie. It is the greatest movie ever made in IMHO. If you are a movie collector you MUST have this movie"
4,Criterion Collection Seven Samurai,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of all times in virtually every knowledgeable reviwer's list, the Criterion Collection's Seven Samurai DVD is without a doubt the finest version available with English Subtitles. If you are fluent in Japanese, however, and own a code-free DVD player you may want to consider the new Toho Studio's production, which is part of their ""The Kurosawa Masterworks Collection""(sic). It is also available separately. Toho digitally remastered the originals for best sound and image, but this version has only Japanese subtitles."
5,Brilliant.,"Fantastic! loads of extras and the image quality has been improved drastically in this release. if you're a fan, then this is the ultimate edition of this epic film."
5,Several Editions - Get the 2006 release,"The 2006 release was remastered and the three discs contain much new commentary. More importantly, the video quality is as good as you can get with much cleaning and artifact removal from the remaining prints since the master prints were lost. Much restoration of what you see and what you hear.The 1998 DVD release is still available so check the release date."
2,Seven Samurai - Especially good for those understanding Japanese,"Seven Samurai is a truly great movie. Unfortunately, I am legally blind and am unable to read the English subtitles. If only there could have been an English-speaking version.I'm very disappointed after paying the stiff price and receiving what I could barely understand by watching it but without any effective translation on what waws being said.Unhappy Review"
2,Why standard formatting????,"Sure the special features are great, but to what possible end would someone release such a masterfully-shot film in ""standard"" aspect ratio. DVD was supposed to set us free from the tyranny of formatting!!!! I say wait for a widescreen re-release."
2,Didn't like it,"Since I liked The magnificent Seven, I had long for this movie for a long time. The time had come and I was totally bored. Who says this is the greatest movie and Kurosawa is the greatest movie maker? Picking up one would be very difficult but probably I will pick Godfather instead. I know there are many Kurosawa admirers but I always found his directing is kind of 'clumsy', weird pace-not smooth, over the top acting (here, esp. Mifune...a clown). I hate his black/white shooting although I love Black/White filmes. Yojimbo was the only movie I enjoyed from his movies. Too bad..."
2,So much praise for an outdated movie ...,"This movie is really good, but it's not the masterpiece people keep talking about. The sound is awful, some parts are boring, the idea is not original. Of coruse Japanese movie at the fifties didn't have the resources the American movie industry already had in those days. It's worthwhile watching."
5,Blind people with harrasing thoughts..,"I don't know what to say about all those who has rated this movie with four stars or less.. I would have get my taste of understanding and my perspective of seeing checked, if I were you. Since it's not possible to do it yet, i could do nothing but wish you good luck with the rest of your life.."
5,"Action, depth, passion - just for starts!","If you want an action movie with characters you can believe in, even find yourself rooting for and becoming attached to, this is for you. If you want a movie where you get to see characters develop based on situations, influence, and new experiences, this is for you. If all you want is a riveting movie where the characters embody their beliefs with passion, this is for you. If not, put ""roger rabbit"" in the search window.This is one of the greatest movies ever!"
4,"I was scared by the theatrical trailer, but the film was...","...Great. If you like westerns such as The Good the Bad and the Ugly, or Once Upon a Time in the West. Or maybe your obsessed with Bushido Blade. In any case, if you can look past the subtitles and culture shock, you will find an excellent film about 7 diverse samurai."
4,My husband loved it...,My husband remembered this movie from way back and mentioned if I ever saw it to get it for him. He loved it!
4,"I can see why it's a ""classic""","I bought this for my husband after he told me it was one of his favorite movies of all time. I understand it was very advanced for the time it was released, and the story is pretty interesting (to guys especially, it seems), but it might be the type of movie you have to watch in several sittings--it's 3 hours of samurai. He LOVED it though, and couldn't believe it was on DVD!"
4,One caveat,"Great Movie. Quality of picture and sound is super, However, the only caveat is the subtitles disappear at the bottom of the screen. Partially alleviated it by drastically reducing the size of the picture. However, the second line of the subtitles are partially blocked even at the greatly reduced size. Do not know if it is due to a bad disc or a general problem with the edition. Has anyone else experienced this problem? If not for this problem it would be five stars."
5,All time greats,"one of the greatest and most influencial movies of all time. a classic in every aspect of the sense. should be watched by anyone who considers themselves a movie fan, truely a masterpiece. for the time (1954) truely a groundbreaking and epic film."
5,Wow!,"Oh my! Cinematograhy, plot, drama, acting... I can't believe this movie was made in 1956... I can't believe it has subtitles and is so engrossing... I can't believe it is not butter...In a word... ""wow!""If you haven't seen it, see it. The stills are worth it alone... A marvelous still of the mill wheel in the creek, a ""blow you away"" shot at the end of the movie in front of the grave yard, stunning vistas of the village... This is not an in your face block-buster presentation... It is a technically sound film in ALL aspects, done with simplicity and grace. The result is POWERFUL!Top 3 movies of all time? * Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, Apocalypse Now"
4,Solid Samurai Movie,My feeling exactly for all the positive reviews of this movie . A great movie ( you'll never feel that it is 3.2hr long!) It is well worth your money and even though it is in B& W and mono! A definite reference DVD collection! I am a fan of the samurai history etc..it is definitely worth my S$70 purchase! . The audio commentary is superb which enhances your post-knowledge of the movie .
5,The mother of a hundred movies,"When you hear a movie is ""art"", fifty years old, black and white and three hours long, you might be to run, but in this film director Akira Kurosawa tells a story that is beautiful, timeless and exciting. How many times have you seen a pitiful oppressed town reach out to a ragtag bunch of swordsmen/gunfighters/solders to save them? This is the movie that did it best. A feudal Japanese village is awaiting the return of the brigands who will be again take their barley crop. A villager convinces the others to hire protection. The samurai are chosen and everyone is transformed, including you.The Magnificant Seven is most often cited as its progeny, but how about A Bug's Life or The ""A"" Team?"
3,Seven Samurai,"I have mixed feelings about Seven Samurai, why? Probably due to the length of the film,Yes it looks beautiful,the settings,the black and white,but nearing 3 hours?Maybe I can't appreciate a Non-American(Or Foreign to me) Film,It has good acting and fight scenes,but I actually liked 13 assassins(a Much later and contemporary film that of course for artistic measure can't compare and it is even more brutally violent.)Somehow will fawn over the ""artistic"" values,I would have too,albeit if it was under the nearly 3hours,and not as slow paced."
5,"Again, a MASTERPIECE!","Ever wonder where the idea for THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN came from? Me either, but this is it. =)"
2,Highly Overrated,"Together with the M.Scorcese's ""The Raging Bull"" this is one of the most overrated movies in the cinema history.I watched it twice trying to get it's ""greatness"" and ""depth"",but apart from a poor and flat story about a group of stinking villagers running with wooden spears from one place to another and screaming at each other I couldn't find anything that touched my heart or soul, or gave me food for thought.Three hours wasted for a primitive action schlock.Don't get me wrong! I adore A.Kurosawa's real,timeless masterpieces,but not his ""samurai films"" (Seven Samurai,Yojimbo,Sanjuro and Hidden Fortress),which to my mind are his weakest and the least interesting.They BY NO MEANS are on the same league with such TRUE GEMS of Kurosawa like ""Rashomon"",""High And Low"",""Ikiru"",""Redbeard"",""Bad Sleep Well"",""Throne Of Blood"",""Dersu Uzala"",""Ran"".Go for these eight films - they are real cinematic treasure!"
1,Legendary and Lengthy,"Toshiro Mifune gobbles up the screen. His presence saved this movie for me. There was too much 'drama' in this movie. It took me a really long time to get invested in the characters. I found it simplistic (although that was intentional). The other thing I enjoyed was seeing the countryside. I know it's a classic but it's too long for me. It takes too long to get the samurai and bring them back, and then too long getting ready for the attack. So shoot me."
2,Vastly Overated,"I do believe many people give this film high marks simply because film critics say so. Speaking of overated how about Grand Illusion and Rules of the Game. Do not get me wrong I love foreign films such as The Cranes are Flying, Rififi, Germany Year Zero,and The Passion of Joan of Arc. I really tried to see what amazes and overwhelms most everyone but I guess it passed me by. An excruciatingly boring drivel with terrible acting."
2,good but not great,"I finally saw this film after hearing so much about it. It was good, but it's not THE greatest film of all. The editing seems sloppy at times, the action sequences are OK, and the audio is very bare. But then again it was made in 1954. The characters are definitely captivitating and the story is good but this is a bad transfer of a highly acclaimed film. Criterion prides itself for it's superior quality DVDs, but this transfer was poorly done. The film is drenched with scratches, black spots, dirt, burn marks and an annoying light flickering. For the price I paid, I expected a pristine copy. This Criterion is NOT worth buying. Save your $40+ tax and rent it (although I hear Criterion might redo this DVD) Two stars for the crappy transfer."
5,Seven Samurai,I love this movie and could watch it over and over. Toshiro Mifune's acting is wonderful and I also love the photography and humor of the film. What more can you say? :^)
5,A True Classic Film,"One of the best black & white films made should be in every one's collection, while it may seem a bit slow compared to modern film. It has one thing most of them don't which is I can watch this film over and over an always see some thing different or see what is going on in new way."
5,Five Stars For Seven Samurai,"Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune-what more do you need? As stated in the Amazon.com's Editorial Review: ""This is not a film that can be well served by any synopsis; it must be seen to be appreciated."" You will truly not be disappointed."
3,Criterion Is NOT the Paragon of Quality,"For a film with such a hefty price tag, I would expect the english subtitles to at least be accurate...there are instances, such as when the word ""become"" is confused with ""because,"" that simply make no sense.Aside from that (again keeping in mind the massive price tag Criterion has assigned to this disc), there are plenty of scratches and weird black spots scattered throughout the print. They cleaned up some of it, but apparently ran out of patience (I don't see how they could have run out of money!).I give 5 stars to Akira Kurosawa, but loud jeers for the greedy crooks at Criterion."
5,Fantastic,Great quality on the video and the audio front. The packaging was a bit messed up and broke. But I'm assuming that happened on the mail.
4,An epic,A movie worthy of being called an epic. Beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted this story takes the viewer back to a place and time that can only be imagined and it does it with a richness and depth only imagined by few films today.
5,The Seven Samurais,"I've seen this movie manyatimes and think it one of the all time best. Or in the millennial cliche: it has to be the best of all movies.To relate the impact of this movie on some young Japanese overseas students who don't get to see Kurosawa in Japan - which is a bloody shame - and only gets to see it in N. America, one needs use only one word: Wow!Forget the derivatives, this - as well as Yojimbo and Sanjuro - is the REAL thing!"
3,"Good, not great.","Having read countless 5 star reviews my expectations before watching this film were very high. I was disappointed. Let me say that I enjoyed The Last Samurai so much so that I found this movie by searching for other movies in the genre.To compare the two is like comparing a 2004 BMW(The Last Samurai) to a 1994 BMW(Seven Samurai), the 1994 was a great car for its time but is no comparison to the newer model. If Seven Samurai is on anyone's top-ten movie list it is only because they have not seen a movie since 1956. At times I felt as though I was watching something out of The Three Stooges and not a serious movie."
2,A disappointment,"I have tried watching this film several times and have never been able to get through it due to boredom. The audio commentary on this one is something else as the commentator makes a big deal out of every shot, even the most mundane and obvious ones. He could find a silver lining in a typhoon! The acting is over-the-top as far as I am concerned. This is just another art house foreign film that you are supposed to like because it's good for you - just like broccoli, I suppose."
1,Defective DVD,"Would not play on one of our DVD players. Screen message"" please insert a disk"" Disk is inserted.Used second DVD player and it worked until intermission.Disk stopped and would not run. We tried everything.Since I love this story~ How do i get it replaced with a good DVDMIchael Karaffa"
2,didnt like it.,"didnt like this movie at all. did not find it beautiful, did not find any of the characters even remotely interesting. in fact if you asked me i could not tell you who the main character was. Kurosawa was praised for his camera work, in showing all the major characters, but that's exactly the problem. yes the characters were major but WHO was the main? also, for a film that sets the standard for action films, ive watched almost all of it (prolly 1 hour lefT) and havent seen one fighting sequence. or anything."
1,I'M YAWNING ...,"If you're having trouble with insomnia, retn this one, Your troubles will be cured. I have the greatest patience with non-American movies that sets well out of the mainstream. But this 1956 production definitely is not the great movie the critics say it this. It's just a boring Japanese production, totally uninspired, slow paced. Ok, the famous fighting under the rain is a very well-shot sequence, but to reach that far one must be really determinated !"
1,Easily one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen.,"This 3.5 hours took me about four viewings just to get through it. I am a fan of old movies, but this one just does not do it for me. I kept watching because the movie received so many great ratings that I assumed it must have some redeeming features. If so, I just don't see them."
1,One of the most boring movies ever!,"I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm really not an Asian-movie person. I just don't ""get"" them, and I'm sure it's a cultural thing. ""Tampopo,"" ""Crouching Tiger,"" ""In the Realm of the Senses"" and now this one -- I couldn't sit through any of them. Unless you are a martial arts or samurai fanatic, or a big lover of Japanese culture and history, I would say definitely skip this -- especially if you are female. I think this is one of those ""Emperor's New Movies"" that we're all supposed to like, and no one will admit to NOT liking it for fear of being thought ignorant!"
3,disappointed,"I had seen an earlier translation of the SEVEN SAMARI which was, I thought, truer to the japanese. Things like ""fencing"" which is a foreign concept and ""brats"" instead of ""pisspants"". The translation seemed to dumb down the dialogue."
4,A good movie,"I saw this Kurosawa's famous movie ""Seven samurai."" Honestly, I thought this movie was good but not great. The story is good and entertaining, but it's little slow and sometimes I really can't hear what the actors say, especially Mihune. The acting wasn't that good. And this movie is just old now, or my expectation was too much for it.If someone asks me if I enjoyed this movie, I'll say ""Yes."" No doubt!I give 3 stars to this movie and 1 extra star to the name of Kurosawa, I think it'll explain a lot about what I want to say about this and all Kurosawa's movies. Maybe, Kurosawa's name adds some power to ordinary movies.I'll just rent his movies, but I won't buy them."
3,No CD,"I ordered this item for the CD, which was highly recommended to me. However, none accompanied the book. I am leaving this review to alert buyers to the possibility that the CD no longer comes with this book."
2,No CD included.,"The book is exactly what I needed, but it's supposed to come with a CD and this book did not. It wasn't indicated that it did not include the CD. This was misleading."
2,For Snoopy fans only,"Other books have tried this same concept and succeeded more: Naomi Epel's ""Writers Dreaming,"" ""The Best Writing on Writing"" edited by Jack Heffron, the essays in the annual ""Writer's Handbook,"" or even Frederick Busch's ""Letters to a Fiction Writer.""The twist here is the Snoopy comics - and there are many in this book. Snoopy, the Literary Ace, is a favorite of mine, but I limited the stars due to the lack of substance in the text, particularly for the price! I read it twice, and the book is so unfocused, minimalistic, and generic in its approach as to be useless. The writers represent everything from sci-fi to self-help yet there is suprisingly little writing advice or even reminiscences an aspiring writer might relate to or learn from. It's more like snippets collected at a literary cocktail party.For HUMOR about writing, I'd recommend this book. For anything more meaty, I'd recommend the books previously mentioned."
1,Complete turd,Won't charge at all and I've only had it 8 months. Useless! Save your money and yourself from frustration.
4,Great Phone,"Extremely Happy. My only disappointment was that it is hard to see the ""new message"" alert on the darkened screen."
4,Best value for basic phone,"If you're looking for a phone without all the bells and whistles this is quite adequate. I bought mine a year ago and was quite pleased with it but surprised that the battery already needs replacing; however, I do keep it off the cradle from 8:30 in the morning until early evening during the work week. Have found only one site so far with the battery and it's 19.95. I might as well buy another phone.So the only drawback on this phone is if you're going to keep it off the cradle all day nearly every day buy something with a larger battery pack, otherwise it's fine."
4,Vtech T2326,"Great phone for space saving on the desk. Not the clearest reception and the caller ID is a bit difficult to read. Overall, a fine phone for the price."
1,Coasters,I have been unable to get my NEC DVD Burner to write on these disks. Upgraded drivers and looked at Radius site which say they are compatable with my drive but so far no luck. I also bought the + bundle and they work with my dirve but write at 2X. I am sorry I purchased these.
2,"CAREFUL: Cheap, yes. But these are low quality media","Radius Technology DVDs ID as ""OPTODISC"" brand media. (That is, OPTODISC makes the discs for Radius). OPTODISC media are generally found to be lousy: poor compatibility with many burners and many ""coaster"" (unreadable) burns. Amazon has high quality RIDATA blanks for a little more money. I highly recommend you buy them instead. Save yourself a lot of headaches and (if you store anything of importance) heartbreak. There really *IS* a significant difference between very cheap DVD media (like these) and better DVD media (like the Ridata)."
4,Almost like new,Arrived fast. Arrived in good condition. Most of all the price was phenomenal. Thank you very much.
3,I basically agree with Mr. Samuelson: far too much advice.,"Though the text has some good discussion of the writing process and useful exercises, the authors tend to set down at times questionable ""rules"" and much too much advice. The price is also out of line for most students in public universities and colleges, especially adult education students who want to write as a means of personal enrichment--and it is the latter type of student rather than the next Hemingway or Frost who is most likely to register for a creative writing courrse."
2,"As a teacher, I found the ""sports coach"" tone distracting.","There are already dozens of creative writing ""how to"" books on the market...Why make a student spend this much for a book that's overloaded and at times condescending? Too much advice can intimidate a student; far more useful are exercises and suggestions from practicing writers."
2,Unprofessional and patronizing,"While I'm not the most prolific or most experienced writer, I am familiar enough with the field to not be talked down to like a 6th grader in a father-son chat. While the authors attempts to be ""chumy"" with the reader, they really do no more than patronize and make apparent their academic lack. There were no new ideas presented here--even for a beginning text, I would recommend looking elsewhere for a better basic understanding of the guidelines that will help your work work."
4,Probably the best source in English,"The duchy of Burgundy in the 14th and 15th centuries was remarkable - and very fortunate - in having a dynasty of four Valois dukes, one after another, who were superior to most of their peers in intelligence, charisma, political perspicacity, and sheer magnificence. Philip ""the Bold"" was shrewd and a patron of the arts, John ""the Fearless"" was almost too ambitious for his own good, Philip ""the Good"" almost took the throne of France, and Charles ""the Rash"" went toe-to-toe with Louis XI, the first modern ruler in terms of cold-blooded nationalism. Calmette was a leading authority on this period and he spends some time specifically on the evolution of Burgundy from a weak kingdom to a more powerful duchy and on the problems of dynastic succession. This is arguably the best general study of ducal Burgundy available in English. Be aware, though, that several egregious errors were made in drawing the genealogical charts."
1,ripoff!,"mos def & peeps ripped off the hook from nocera's ""summertime, summertime"" single, and no credit!!shame, but business as usual, i guess..."
4,"Very thick, Strong","On the picture online, the color looked like green and white thread. It has no color, alot thicker than it looks and alot bigger. Very happy with purchase."
4,Wrong product - my fault - but nice,"I bought this thinking it was an eye loupe, not an eyeglass loupe, so it does not fit my needs. My cousin ended up using it a few times and likes it"
4,Deep roots Afro-Cuban Guajira Jubilie,"I have been married to a Cubanita for 6 years. Her family lives for GOOD Cuban Music. This is one of the better compiliations of the Son Montuno rhythmn that I have heard. I gave all of the songs high ratings @DJ.com, then realized that they were on the same Disc, what a pleasant surprise."
3,The movie is 5 stars but beware of DVD,"I guess you get what you pay for, this dvd is horrible. The quality is terrible and appears to be recorded from a video camera filming the movie displayed on a projector. The Sante Fe Trail is one of my favorite movies but due to its lack of ""political correctness"" the studios refuse to remaster and release an official version. I would avoid this dvd and hope for a official release sometime in the future."
3,Santa Fe Faded,"What should have been a good movie, and goodm story was spoiled by the faded print. It looked like a 1920's movie. Such a pity. The packaging and delivery were very good"
3,Olivia de Havilland at her best,"The reason I saw this film was because it was starring Olivia de Havilland. The film itself was good, but Olivia de Havilland was obviously the best. I obviously loved GWTW, but I had to admit Olivia's charicter Kit was beautiful, strong, and smart. I think if you're an Olivia de Havilland fan, WATCH THIS FILM"
4,"This is about ""Abilene Town""","Randolph Scott stars as a rugged, laconic lawman, caught between the competing interests of cattlemen, homesteaders and the nervous townspeople who gave him a job, but hope that he doesn't stir up trouble on his own. Scott plays the marshall with an interesting mix of pragmatism, morality and machismo, each of which pulls him in separate directions; a charismatic actor who is often underrated by film historians, Scott is at his best here, projecting the sheer physicality one imagines a border lawman would have to have possessed back in them days. Fun stuff."
3,Saturday Morning Matinee Movie,"As always, Ronnie is completely likable in this movie. It looks like it was filmed in the hills of California, not on location at West Point or in Kansas, so it is historically ""iffy"".Reagan sparkles with vitality and likability, but he is not really the star. So we do not see as much of him as we would like to see.As with these types of movies, there is a strong sense of right and wrong, the good guys win, and everything has a sense of purpose.I recommend this movie to Reagan fans and to those who love B-Western stars like Roy Rogers and Gene Autry."
1,John Brown a Role Model,"An undercurrent theme of the movie is a man who would give his life so black men may be free from slavery. Such a man must be insane. John Brown was a religious zealot. Who believed serving God was man's ultimate purpose. That meant God before family members. That meant training his children to give up their lives so other men may become free.This movie depicts Mr. Brown as a mad man. The Earl Flynn character says he is against one man taking the law into his own hand. Yet he is depicting Jeb Stuart who joined the Confederate Army who were in open rebellion against the United States of America, because he did not like the election result. In support of nullification of a National election. I will take John Brown's treason over Jeb Stuart's anyday. This movie is sympathetic to one of the worst causes ever fought."
1,strange strange fruit,"A truly strange movie...slavery is ok, and the South will ""sort it out"" in good time. Movies like this built racism and made lynchings possible. Slavery itself isnof course absent from the movie, except for a scared family trying to escape. But never mind, some people will never care. Avoid."
2,Disappointed,"First of all, the rating I gave this DVD is based on the poor quality of the tape transfer not the movie itself. I happen to enjoy this movie.I would rate it 4 stars. When you have Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, President Reagan, and an outstanding performance by Raymond Massey, how can you go wrong? Yes, it's not a historically accurate by and large. But who cares? And really how many Hollywood produced movies are? Just kick back and enjoy this piece of pure escapism. A western full of colorful characters set during the days prior to the Civil War with glorious names (e.g; Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer, J.E.B Stuart, John Brown, etc.) from our American history. However, the tape transfer is horrible. It's grainy and dark in some scenes. It's hard to watch. And there are no extras to it. I would recommend to avoid buying this Synergy Archive Series copy. Let's hope Warner Bros. decides one day to restore this film and market it."
3,"One film rather good quality for public domain, the other not so good...","When buying public domain movies, one must rate on a totally separate scale. Santa Fe Trail is actually not a bad-looking transfer. Of course as you know PD companies generally don't have access to anything even remotely close to an original camera negative, so naturally this isn't as crisp and sparkling as it would be should Warner Brothers ever decide to remaster it, but it is certainly miles above the other versions floating around out there. As for the second feature, Abilene Town, it is a typical shabby print. I guess Marengo just considers it a bonus, so nothing has been done to clean it up. It's watchable, but little else. The purchase price is worth it for what is probably the best looking Santa Fe Trail out there."
2,Santa Fe Trail,Do not buy from this vendor. I have seen this movie on TCM and been very impressed with a number of shots. When I watched this copy I was convinced it must be a warn VHS tape recorded on DVD because the last time I saw such a bad picture was under those conditions (on the tape not recorded to DVD). It has the light showing on screen throughout the whole movie. Also the great B/W scenes do not have great contrasts.I received the tape promptly BUT that's all that was acceptable in this transaction.
5,"Good Old Film ""Santa Fe Tail""",Santa Fe Trail is a fine film of it's time with good acting and a good story.I like Earl Flynn in this alot and Ronald Reagan also is good in it.My digital remaster of the film look great. A Good buy for me.
4,HISTORICAL DRAMA,.....If you don't mind literary licence this is a pretty good story of the Abolitionists and the pro-slavery forces that led to the Civil War. Raymond Masey gives a dynamic performance as the fanatical John Brown who wanted to free the slaves by inciting them to revolt......The movie also pairs Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland for one of their many appearance together with the lovely miss DeHavilland as the love interest of both Flynn and Ronald Reagan with Flynn emerging victorious......Altogether it is an enjoyable film that combines history with fiction and a love story thrown in for good measure.
2,Interesting but not 100% accurate,"I am an American and I have a very good friend from London. Recently my friend came to visit America, and while he was here I pulled out my copy of this book to see what he thought. While many of the terms were accurate, there were a significant number of entries that were outdated, completely off the mark, or close but not quite applied correctly. I handed my friend a red pen and he proceeded to rewrite some entries. He commented several times that the author ""must have never been to England or spoken with actual English people"" as there were so many phrases with inaccurate UK definitions or usages.We did like the pronounciation comparison charts, though, and had a good time saying each of the words and comparing pronounciations. And making fun of the other person where necessary.Overall I'd say, it's a good reference for an overall picture, but if you plan on incorporating any of the phrases into your vocabulary, have it checked by a native first."
4,A handy companion when watching British TV shows on PBS.,"I stumbled upon this book by accident. I don't believe the author meant this as an entertaining book, but a serious reference source for British and American travelers. Just by scanning the pages you can see how misunderstandings can occur even though we are speaking the same language. The example of ""Keep your pecker up"" in Brit is the same as ""Keep smiling"" on this side of the pond could certainly lead to some bizarre encounters. The author limits the work to common and current phrases, which makes the book manageable. Who would have know that Americans in Britain should wear a ""Bum Bag"" instead of a ""Fanny Pack"". As with any travel its good to know the language, even if you already think know it. Divided by a Common Language is a must for any Anglophile. Tom Wilson Tampa, FL"
5,There is English and then there is English.,"I had no idea that we spoke English so differently, and yet we do manage to understand each other!"
2,"An amusing collection, but useless as a reference","This book provides some good information (and some not so good, too), but the problem it that the book is so poorly organized that it is utterly useless as a reference. The words are separated into arbitrary categories, and there is no overall index, so it is impossible to find any particular term without scanning many pages. The text also suffers from badly designed tables and amateur typography; for example, the author uses ALL CAPS both for ACRONYMS as well as TRADEMARKS (instead of simply including the ""tm"" symbol); the overall effect is just as irritating as in this sentence."
5,Mind the Gap!,"Don't drop a clanger-make a big faux pas-when traveling in the U.K! This book is a terrific read for anyone planning a trip to Britain. Amusing and useful, I would recommend DIVIDED BY A COMMON LANGUAGE to anyone hoping to ""say the right thing"" from pubs to politics and television to travel. This book is a gem that will keep you in the know. Cheers!"
4,"Good, but don't rely on it completely","A lot of the British words listed in this book were very helpful, but some were inaccurate. I showed some of the British words in the book to British people, and they told me they had not heard of them. And I had never heard of many of the American words.Of course, the book wasn't perfect, but it was still very helpful. And I realize that some of the mistakes could have something to do with regional dialects."
2,A Semi-Interesting Mess,"The book is largely a glossary - perhaps almost half - which doesn't exactly make for Interesting reading. Some terms were terribly out of date, others wildly obscure, and at worst, just plain useless and random. I love both the UK and language, and I found this book a badly done bore. Also, shame on the publisher for the crappy formatting. I finished about 60% of it before giving up, and I normally eat this stuff up."
1,You CAN be lukewarm about this book,"Reading this novel was like swimming upside down in a vat of peanut oil. Everything seems like it's inverted and moving in slow motion. If a book were ever measured by its weight, then Stones of Summer would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, you may want to read the book. Once you open it and try to sit down to enjoy it, you realize you are not reading a masterpiece, but instead a long-winded, boring tale about characters that you really could care less about. I really want to meet the person who has read this all the way to the end. He/she probably also competes in ""iron man"" triathalons and peruses the tax code for pleasure. The most torturous element of the book is the collection of wholly unlikeable characters. By the middle of the book I didn't care what happened to any of them - in fact I would have liked the book more if they had all died in a fiery car crash."
4,Down the Rabbit Hole,"I'll keep it short, because most everything has already been said. The book absolutely dominated my attention for a week or two. The alienated Midwest upbringing, the almost violent rebellions (usually for no real reason)-- it all rang perfectly true. That's the first half of the novel.Then came Dow's person saga: his real-life descent into madness. Via the book, I felt each dip and swerve as Dow Mossman's life unraveled. This is the only chronicle of schizophrenia worth reading that I'm aware of.So why 4-star instead of 5-star on the review? Because I long for some kind of closure -- I wish I could read the book he SET OUT TO WRITE before the voices in his head became too loud to ignore."
5,Great read!,"I found this book very interesting and enjoyed Mossman's prose. I can't wait for his next novel. From the reviews that have already been posted about this book, I'm reminded of how political books are rated by individuals ... there either 5-stars or 1-star ... depending on your viewpoint."
2,Can't get past word choices,"Okay...I have not been able to finish this book. Some of the author's choices of words are somewhat suspect. In the very first paragraph, he claims that ""the conversations inside the car were like great wood eyes"". How in the sweet Spanish Jesus can a conversation be like a great wood eye? This edition should come with a sheet of LSD, then maybe I could begin to grasp some of the concepts. The only reason I haven't given it one star is because I haven't finished it. Ever hopeful am I...My hope is like a great wall of onyx-like chess pieces. Oh God, it's contagious!"
1,"Wildly meandering, progressively incoherent story","Bought this book for a very long plane flight, excited to discover what prompted the comment placed prominently on the cover that it ""burns with a byzantine fire"". After a struggle of over ten months I finally finished the sprawling and increasingly incoherent story and must admit I'm mystified. Entire paragraphs were completely incomprehensible, with mixed metaphors and comparisons meant to paint a portrait of images and feelings that left me without even a murky idea of what was intended by them. Certainly not worth the time to read, or the $14 I paid for it (which, frankly, is the only reason I felt compelled to finish it). I dislike saying anything so negative, but I'd like to save someone else the pain of feeling invested in finishing over 500 pages of this mess."
1,Witless...,"Applying the axiom that ""brevity is the soul of wit,"" this tome is the essence of inanity. Plodding, antediluvian prose and stultefying characters make slogging through this work a mind-numbing, pointless task. If you want a coming-of-age book, go read McCullers' ""A Member of the Wedding"" or ""Paper Moon"" by Joe David Brown. However, if you're an insomniac, a couple of pages is all it will take."
1,Into the Remainder Bin,"I couldn't finish this book. I could barely start it. I was not at all interested in the story (or lack of) and there was a lot of the stream of consciousness business that I just HATE. I was incredibly disappointed as I loved the movie ""The Stone Reader"" and was really really excited to read the book. I can't imagine what came over that film maker. (Maybe he read a different book?!) I'll be giving this one to Goodwill before I am overcome with some weird notion that I should make another attempt at reading this book."
1,Overhyped,"I too expected big things out of this book after seeing the movie Stoned Reader. But the book never lived up to the hype. It was quit dull, actually and about 400 page too long"
2,Needs a good editor,"I read this novel after watching the documentary Stone Reader and was terribly disappointed. Stones of Summer is a mudhouse of verbiage that collapses under its own pretentious weight. By the end of the book I felt sorry for the poor author, Dow Mossman.A note on the documentary:I originally gave Stone Reader a positive review on amazon.com despite reservations about the director's dubious 'search' for Mossman and his annoying attempts to upstage the publishing people he interviews. What changed my mind was a recent newspaper story about how he sent our thousands of e-mails begging others to leave favorable reviews at amazon.com, even if they had never seen the movie. Trickery of this sort lowers my opinion of both the director and his film. Neither is worthy of our consideration."
2,Everybody must not get Stones,"With 'Stones of Summer' already consigned to the remaindered bins, I would like to agree with the previous reviewer. 'Stones' is not terrible, it is just not very good. What I find inexcusable though is the fact that most if not all the favorable reviews posted in this forum were planted by the publisher. Can't we readers be trusted to form our own opinions?"
1,Over-rated,"I saw a documentary on Stones of Summer in Boston and was eager to see if the novel really lived up to the hype. The answer is NO! This book is slooooooooow and in love with itself and needs some real serious editing. It picked up a little after the first 100 extremely dull pages, but not enough to get me thru the next 500!"
2,BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK? THE REVIEWS!,"I haven't been this entertained reading AMAZON reviews in awhile so I too tried to read it but was stopped cold by too many diverting descriptions starting with the word ""like..."" This is amateurish so-called ""writing"" that, thank the Lord, the author failed to follow up with another to compare with it. I only hope that those who gave it 5 stars aren't compelled to try their hand at authorship --- only the negative reviews were worth reading...A BIG WASTE OF PRECIOUS TIME (try reading Proust for a big fat chunk of your life and you might appreciate a well-written doorstop). Oh, and the 2 stars are for the growing body of amusing reviews, not for the useless book!"
2,"** for the book, * for the film","Caught the programme on this book on BBC4 in Dalkey, sentimental rubbish, to be sure. Director /narrator, a speed reader, acted as if books are personal trophies. Most of us rush along while we read, eager to turn the page, conditioned to move in life as relentlessly as factory workers with a drone ethic. But the best readers are not stone readers. The best readers are the slowest. Speed reading, an American invention, turns out to be skimming, which is not reading at all. The book turns out to be unreadable rubbish. I give it two *s because it makes a great doorstop."
2,You have to love this book,"When I found this book in the book store and read the cover it sounded like a very good read. After looking over some of the pages I was a bit taken aback by some of the prose but thought it would turn out to be a good read. I was wrong.You have to love this book to finish it. I struggled through several tedious pages trying to figure out what the heck Mossman was trying to say, finally giving up and putting it away.The characters weren't very well explained and the conversations they have are just plain boring. Mossman's descriptive style reminded this reader of the hippy-speak of the sixties. It didn't make sense then and it doesn't make any now."
1,A shame,"Into the gobbledeegook go slipper the whipper and the trimtrammaduhdeedo, believing the glubbledubble spewed forth by a madman. What do you think, am I a genius or what? Just send me thirty bucks and I'll send you the next 670 pages.Here are three words for Dow Mossman that he should have tried to make sense of: Ther-a-py. The guy may have had potential at one point, but he ended up a nut. And this book proves it. And also, since he was such a worshiper of Aristotle's, he should have watched out for the philosopher's famous warning: ""No great soul is exempt from a mixture of madness."" True enough, but it is the conquest of that madness, not the surrender to it, which makes a great soul remain so. Mossman, in pitiful fashion, lost the battle, descending from a promising wordsmith to a full-blown babbling idiot. It's a shame, really."
1,NO attention to DESIGN and TYPOGRAPHY Detail - FULL of errors,If you are a graphic designer or graphic design instructor or student PASS THIS ONE UP. There is no basis in design or typography mechanics here whatsoever; it is full of errors and you will have no idea why you are doing anything. Trainers should not be writing books that are considered advanced level design topics. Designers should. Go look up author RYDBERG.
5,Great Book,"This book serves great for beginners but also as a ""refresher"" for those who have been using InDesign already. Great examples, and done in a professional matter."
3,Having More Pictures Would be Good,"I am not an Indian, neither am I well-exposed to Indian food. I recognise only a few dishes, finding most of them unfamiliar. Nevertheless, some unfamiliar ones are interesting enough for me to want to try cooking them. However, I am put off as I do not know how the dish should turn out. Not all recipes in this book are accompanied by pictures; there are only a few pictures interspersed between pages of recipes."
2,Too much of a love story,Some action more of a chick book but for free it gave me something to do. boring love story yup
3,The last Trail,Not what I had hoped for but may be great for others . too old timey for me may be a good read for someone.
4,Ok for my first Western novel read,"I am not into westerns, and had never read one, but had heard of Zane Grey and thought I would give it a try (it was a free download, so if I didn't like it, I lose nothing anyway). I did end up liking it. I didn't love it, but I think if I read a couple more it would grow on me. I would say for someone who doesn't like Westerns, this would still be an enjoyable read, because its not all gun-slinging, tobacco spitting & horse riding. And I like the old fashioned language used, books today just aren't written the same."
1,the last trail,I canceled two book orders when it said I had to pay for them one was incident at muddy creek anr the other was the last trail I never resd them althought one of the went to page 18 when I touched something on my new kindle this is the only way I could get your attention
5,one great book,"I read The Last Trail when I was a teenager over fifty years ago,the book was a pageturner then and it still is today. When reading it back then I was able to see the characters and the scenes so vividly and even today reading it is the same.All of the characters were great but my favorite was Wetzel,a silent but deadly individual that you will never forget, I didnt. This is a great book that you will remember always.So order and enjoy and it is also free."
5,The Eastern Western,"Zane Grey's first novels concerned his ancestors, the Zane family, and the Ohio frontier of the late 18th century. They are fairly authentic, historically, and heroic and romantic as well."
4,A good read,"A very good Zane Gray style western. I ordered the book ""26 Zane Gray Novels"" because I liked this one."
5,Aw some book,"This book had adventure as well as romance. I was kept in suspense till the end. It is a good read, I had a hard time putting this book down once I started reading it"
3,The last trail,"Typical of the writers other books. Action and romance. Well written with a strong vocabulary. Not many movies of this genre written, these days . I think with the right actors and a"
4,The last trial,"Good plot, loads of adventure. Hero, heroine, bad guys and Indians....what more could you ask for... I am looking forward to another Zane Gray."
4,The last trail,A little bit of history wound through adventure--enjoyed it. A quick read. Also interesting how the language changes from the time this was written to today
3,Great read,Good reading from the start. Some descriptions long but otherwise interesting and exciting. Names and locations easy to follow.Good. Book.
3,great old classic,I forgot how good Zane Grey was. Enjoyed reading it again. Would recommend for everyone. Especially like the descriptions of the settings.
4,Zane Grey's best,"Typical Zane Grey very well written. A must read for men. It is a book that tells it like it really was. People really lived like this, ever moment a risk. Indians always watching ready to take someone or kill you. I had a great uncle who benefited from the signing of the scyamore shoals treaty in 1774. He was a fur trapped and made many trip into Tennessee & Kentucky. The Indians caught him with a canoe full of furs. They took his fur, canoe, clothes, gun, food, everything he had, left him naked in the wilderness. He made several trips & became well of. The Indians tried to kill him several times & did. He wrote with his own blood "" Killed by Indians ""..."
4,The Last Trail,"Nice read, the writer creates great visual images with words. I think if you like a little history of how things were in the midwest frontier this is a great fictional read."
3,Poor Copy,Unfortunately this edition suffers from poor quality. A complete page is missing (p. 24 left blank) and several pages have a smaller font size than intended. I would hesitate buying another book from this source.
5,THE LAST TRAIL,"GOOD READ! Time set was very according to period of history. Description of geographic and nature, put reader in the moment."
4,A great adventure,A great story to be read by a l l ages. The entire book is fast moving and hard to put down.
3,The Last Trail,It was an okay book. Kind of slow moving. Overall not a bad book. Parts of the book were dry.
3,Great mystery,love on Zane Grey. Interesting story with a different twist. I recommend this book for any older child and adult
5,The Last Trail,"I am about half way through this book and am enjoying it thoroughly. The characters are well developed and can envision the Ohio frontier with his descriptive writing. If you enjoy a good western, this is a good pic."
3,damaged but happy,"item arrived damaged but company provided replacement efficiently and without any hassle. polite, prompt and efficient service. attractive bracelet. the silver beads on the bracelet are a little cheap looking but as they age and oxide they will look better...."
2,What's The Fuss,"This is a very average book of poems--little to excite or delight. The poem about the last Castrato reminded me of that film Faranelli--a good film, an okay poem. The dog and wolf stuff reminded me of James Dickey's famous poem about the stage between dog and wolf. The language in these poems is neither dazzling nor surprising, but one can sense that the poet is dedicated to the cause of poetry. The imitations function well as tributes, if not as full-developed poems.I do wonder why the reviewer below would waste fifteen minutes writing a review of someone else's review. That to me seems ridiculous. The poet doesn't need anyone to defend her work. Any new book of poetry is a good thing. This book is fairly inoffensive if not unremarkable. I would think the poet would be delighted that people are reading her book and have any response to it at all. I wonder what will come next for this poet after she have moved beyond the ""Cusp."""
4,It's really quite good,"Grotz's first collection is a rather impressive one. Yes it has its faults. It does sag in the middle, but the first section is wonderful and the final section is quite good. But the books also has its positive points. Grotz covers a wide range of styles and subjects in her poems. And though none stick out as a truly phenomenal poem, there are many good poems in the book. I look forward to seeing more of her work as she matures."
1,Awful,"This is truly one of the worst books of poems I have read this year. With the exception of a handful of poems, this book was not ready for publication much less to win the Bakeless Prize. The faux intelligence, the vapid imitations, the lifeless and lackluster lines: a book in need of serious editing. I refuse to go on and on like others have done here. Basically, if Grotz hadn't studied with Komunyakaa (the judge of the contest), and if she hadn't been a Bread Loaf fixture for over five years, she would never have won this contest. Every famous poet in America can annoint this book, but it doesn't change the fact readers will not be duped. Grotz, a would-be Empress, is wearing no clothes."
5,Mopar or No Car!!,"This is by far the most researched book of its kind on the market today. To say that it is full of fun facts, Mopar models, various engines of the era, etc., etc., would be an understatement. Having lived in those glory days of Mopar myself - and owned and raced a few Mopars of my own - I highly recommend this book for any automotive enthusiasts library."
3,Maximum Performance:Mopar Super Stock Drag Racing 1962-1969,"I admire the Author who served in 'Nam and The way he Put the book together is stellar, All the Cars and Photos,great text it wouldn't disappoint the Pentagram/Mopar guys,good thing about it is they beat the Blue Oval Fanboys bad thing Is I'm not into Mopars but something way better."
2,Humm?,"I just couldn't get into this. I did only read one page however, and skimmed through a few more. So I can't really recommend it. However, it might be a good read for those who are very interested in the history & origins of tea. Jenn"
3,Fairly interesting.,"This book is relatively interesting, though it is a bit dry in places. Worth a read for people who are tea-lovers and those interested in the tea ceremony."
3,not what i thought,"i thought i would be reading a nice story of the japanese tea ceremony, instead i read a most decidedly bitter anti-western lament. it was interesting, though. i'm glad it was free, however."
3,Esoteric,"May have been looking for something else. I do appreciate I have much to learn about Eastern philosophy. However, I will read this again when I am in a more relaxed frame of mind."
5,A Life Bible,"This little book, with its elegant evocative language has all the elements of the poetry of life. Everyone should have a copy to enjoy. With the older book, in its sliding box cover, the atmosphere is set in an aesthetic manner as befits the theme, but it is the contents that matters."
5,Very enjoyable reading!,This is probably the neatest book I've ever read. It is an interesting introduction to how tea is much more than just a casual beverage. Tea is a cultural element of both CHinese & Japanese life.
4,the elevated statud of tea,"this book is simple to the point of eloquence. at times it seems to go too much into the history, but that helps in the understanding of the book. it is a good read for anyone who is interested in expanding their understanding of their world and desires to appreciate the natural beauties of the world."
2,not a novel,Having read a few of his novels I was looking forward to another of his stories about different generations in Japan. Instead I found a detailed and tedious history of tea. I gave up after a couple of hours.
1,A sad exploitation of an author who lost his copyright.,Kakuzo Okakura would turn over in his grave if he saw the ridiculous treatment his fine essay has been given. Tuttle's previous restrained and decorous editions fit with the content. This new edition is a travesty. Shame on Tuttle (the publisher) and their hired help for this marketing folly.
1,not as good as other reviews suggest,"Short treatise on the value of appreciating the simple things in life. The problem here is that the vocabulary used here is beyond many readers. While that is fine when such words are required to convey meaning, here they seem to be used just for the sake of using them. They get in the way and obstruct the reading and meaning unnecessarily.The book also presents appreciation of small things as being superior to appreciating other things yet the argument is not backed up with any rationale. For that I find this book to be a bit shallow. I think there are other books on eastern philosophy that would serve the reader better."
1,I didn't order or get this item!,"I have no idea what this is, I didn't order it and I didn't get it,, maybe I better see if I got charged for it lol"
1,Title is deceiving,"This was not an easy book to read, in fact I couldn't get into it so I didn't finish it. I thought it was going to be about tea ceremonies in Japan or China but was not that at all. Maybe it's because of my age (72) but I like light, uplifting reading in world of violence and mind-numbing sci-fi which I don't like at all. I like a book that has innocence in it that is so hard to find these days."
2,Mis leading title for me,It did not match the title. I am a Tea lover and assumed the book is more on Tea comparison
2,Ughhhhh,"I guess I was looking for something else when I ordered this. It is very mundane and dark. Am open to most things but this is a little over the top. Sorry, but I just didn't like it."
2,Hmmm,"With all of my love to Japanese literature, I cant say I enjoyed this one. Extremely difficult to read. But if you are up for a challenge, go ahead. I have read many Japanese authors and this one one just doesnt seem to have a natural flow I'm so used to. Maybe, it is just a transation"
2,Not what I thought,Just was not what I expected so I did not enjoy. A difficult read for me. I thought the title is intriguing.
2,Not what I anticipated judging by the title.,"This book was nothing like what I expected, but I read it to the end just out of sheer stubbornness.I expected more of a history and evolution of the tea product but the book was all about the [highly opinionated] mentality, mysticism and ritual surrounding the use of tea through history.If this is what you're looking for, go for it.If you are looking for more information regarding the tea plant, you'll be better served looking elsewhere."
1,BORING,I found this book so boring I can't believe anyone would write about such a BORING subject and I love tea! DISCARD!
5,East meets West,"A gentle illumination of ""teaism,"" which is really all about the Japanese approach to life. It's the best quick read I've ever seen for someone from the West wanting to understand better how the Japanese think."
4,more philosophy than tea,"This is hardly a book about tea, although it mentions tea on some rare occasions. :) It's about philosophy, meaning of art, nature and flowers, relationship between Japan and America/Europe on the beginning of the 20th century etc. A deeply philosophical and beautiful book."
4,"Not his best playing, but his widest range of playing","The dial and savoy sessions are smaller, shorter and more brilliant. But Norman Granz was committed to bring Charlie Parker to the world beyond bebop fans, and this album is the best of those efforts. From the Carib ""My little suede shoes"" to the small group bop ""Blues for alice"", ""Au Privave"" and ""Confirmation"" to the best of strings ""Laura"" and ""April in Paris"" to jam fests with Ella and Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins, to the perfectly dreadful ""Old Folks"" this album gives you the full picture of the late charlie parker. Listen very carefully for Tony Aless on ""Repetition"" -- it's worth the effort!"
3,Beautiful girls and special effects NOT done by ILM,"Fans of the extemely low-budget Witchcraft franchise know what to expect: gorgeous women, desktop computer special effects, video cinematography that was not done with a hi-def Panavision Genesis camera, and clumsy editing that must have been done in a big hurry! So Witchcraft 13 won't disappoint, and it gets down to business right away in the pre-title sequence: a beautiful girl in a tight white blouse and black cheerleader mini-skirt vigorously seducing a man before she rips out his heart. (Or some hunk of rubber covered with goo that is supposed to be a heart) Later there is another good sequence featuring a short-haired blonde witch in a skimpy white halter doing the same with the hero Will Spanner. This film actually has some fairly smooth editing and adequate direction in spots. The production values of this film are about the same as that for Witchcraft 2, but who cares? I'm ready for Witchcraft 14 and 15."
1,13 an unlucky number,"haven't seen a witchcraft series movie in a while so decided to check it out. yikes! ultra-low budget as the previous reviewer stated, but are the typical beautiful women in this dvd? sorry to say, no. not that i want to get insultive or anything, but the actresses, with the exception of one are very homely and unattractive. it's like they went out and found some women to volunteer to do this movie for credit rolls or something. bad acting, bad editing and horrible and i mean horrible lighting. they used natural lighting and everything is super dark. which is probably good since you don't want to see how bad this film really is. i like the series nevertheless and will have to check out some others."
2,Long Running Series,It was very low budget with bad acting. There are several scenes of cleavage and eventually a couple bare breast scenes. Worth seeing once or twice for horror enthusiasts. They used the exact same pentagram I own as a prop in the movie.
5,Excellent in destroying the myth of the oppressed slaves,"This is an excellent econometric study of the institution of Southern slavery, showing it to be relatively benign in the South (whereas in other countries it could be hideously oppressive). One book that would be interesting to read in conjunction with this is ""The South Was Right!"" by James Ronald Kennedy and Walter Donald Kennedy which also lays to rest the myth that the American Civil War was fought over the slavery issue,actually the pretext for war. The Kennedys suggest partly an economic motive in that the North wanted to retain the South as ""milch cow"" to be milked for tariffs. They imply an underlying battle between Northern Federalism and Southern States' Rights, and insist that the War should be called the War for Southern Independence."
1,Not to be taken seriously.,"This book is useful mostly as an example of how not to approach history. Fogel and Engerman used data based on slaveholders' records to conclude that slaves were treated well in the old South. They counted, for example, the exact number of beatings that an average slave would experience in year and concluded that it was only a few, without considering the impact of witnessing beatings of one fellow slaves, many of whom were family members or close friends. They counted the calories consumed by slaves but ignored data like actual caloric expenditures of slaves (which rendered their intake barely sufficient) and infant mortality (very high). This book serves mainly to reinforce one's prejudices and should not be read without also looking at other works in the field."
2,Flawed methodology & boneheaded interpretation,"The reviews below present the findings of this book as unproblematic and uncontested. In fact, publication of this book in 74 caused a firestorm of debate and criticism. My title sums up the main thrust of the criticisms, for anyone especially interested see Herbert Gutman's, ""The World Two Cliometricians Made"", Journal of Negro History, Jan. 75, for one of the most persuasive of the book's critics."
4,definitely for shroom lovers,A really great recipe book for lovers of wild Shrooms. For those shroom gatherers that have more than they can deal with this will give some really great ideas.
2,Too gourmet,"Seriously, these recipes aren't realistic. Where the heck am i going to get bison, quail, or bear meat in urban Ohio? Most of the recipes are like that. Sorry no use for the average housewife."
2,don't bother,"I bought this camera for the 'wireless' feature. Found out after it ONLY works (theoretically) with XP, 32 bit, SP2 nad if you have anything else forget it. So I tried to install it in my home computer which happens to have exactly the above parameters, nothing doing, not even with the help of my geekiest friend. Excluding the wireless feature the camera is very pedestrian, my Sony is 10x better and I imagine there are dozens of others as well."
4,Nice small camera,"Its a nice camera with good features. The small zoom (3x) is the only downside. Using wireless downloads of photos is great. So far, battery life seems to be fine, but I think i am going to need a spare battery for when I use it for any trips."
5,Let Me Join The Bandwagon,"After reading everybody's reviews, I will have to also chime in and say that the reviewer from ""somewhere in North America"" was absolutely wrong. The other reviewers were definitely right on point. This is one of the best (and most authentic) samba CD's you will ever listen to. You can really feel the heart and soul that was put into it and the raw, non-commercial, natural power that each artist exhibited. This is definitely worth checking out because it is very difficult to find good, authentic samba that is not over stereotyped by Carnaval and catered toward American tourists."
5,Beautiful music,"This is one of the best samba cd's I have ever heard, and is my current favorite. If you love samba you will not be disappointed."
3,Evolving Styx: The Serpent is Rising/Man of Miracles,"I enjoy both of these albums, even though there are no ""hits"" on them. My favorite songs are ""The Grove of Eglantine"", ""Golden Lark"", and ""A Song for Suzanne"". Many of the other songs are respectable. I have always had trouble distinguishing between JY and John Curelewski's vocals. As other reviewers have stated, ""Unfinished Song"", which was released on ""MIRACLES"" years ago (circa 1981), IS one of Dennis De Young's best songs. In fact, I (a die hard Styx fan), never heard ""Lies"" until a few weeks ago when I picked up this compilation while I was visiting CHICAGO (what a coincedence) at Thanksgiving. ""Lies"" does not compare to ""Unfinished Song"". As a last word, you must hear and then buy this CD if for only to own the CD that contains ""Plexiglass Toilet"", which is a hidden track on ""The Serpent is Rising"". A very resonable price and a Tour de Force!"
3,Miracles is the best Styx album prior to Tommy's arrival,"Miracles has long been my favorite Styx album prior to Crystal Ball, Tommy Shaw's first album. Too bad ""Unfinished Song"" is not on this release - much more interesting than ""Lies"" and, along with ""Lady"", one of DDY's strongest songs from the early years. This pairing gets 3 stars simply because Serpent is easily the worst Styx album there is - dark, campy, and ugly. Surprising given that it came after Lady which was lights years ahead of Styx I."
3,MEDIOCRE MATERIAL FROM A GREAT BAND,"I am a huge styx fan and when i bought this album(s)i was slightly disappointed. There are some great songs here, but there are a few that are embarrasingly bad. For example ""As Bad As This"" is horrible. It doesn't get much worse than that. Some of the other songs are decent, such as ""Witch Wolf"" and ""Krakatoa"". They are dark and different, but it's still styx all the same."
1,Just not sturdy.,"I am a bellydance teacher and sometime costume maker; I have a lot of hip scarves and other accessory pieces that need to be easily accessible and stored out of reach of my pets. I've used folding screens for this purpose before, and this one looked perfect for the job, with its hanging rack and small shelves.It's not an expensive piece, but I would not buy it again. Several of the welds have broken in the time I have had it (less than a year), and it is both flimsy and tippy due to the way it is screwed together."
4,Great For Hidding The 10 Zillion Wires Behind My Video Equipment,The left side of my tower of 5 boxes of various video equipment with all the dangling wires behind the TV was exposed for all to see and the black and silver screen blended in well with situation to hide it.
5,Simply stated...,"Simply stated, this is perhaps one of the best ""organ trio"" recordings available. If you're a fan of this genre, you can't go wrong with this CD."
5,Positively Brilliant,"I am not a musician, but I'd like to play one on TV.I have been a big fan of McLaughlin from ""In a Silent Way"" with Miles to ""After the Rain"" and almost everything in between. Every new album of his becomes my favorite for a while. This one, in my opinion, is his best in years! He made me feel that if Coltrane were a guitarist, this is how he would sound. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes modern interpretation of bop."
5,Tasteful and flawlessly played.,"For those of you wanting early Mahavishnu Orchestra fusion pyrotechnics ignore this, but if you want to listen to a guitar,organ,drums trio playing tasteful and flawlessly executed jazz then look no further. Incidentally if you like this as I did then check out Live In Tokyo which is equally superb with the fine Dennis Chambers on drums instead of Elvin Jones in this instance. Check it out!"
1,McLaughlin leaves us waiting,"I have been an avid follower of John Mclauglin's method of crafting an art called fusion. Though the Mahavishnu days are over and John's prior attempts at smooth jazz have been successful, this release is sour and dull. Though John does execute his technical prowess (ie. ""chops"") as always and the band plays beautifully, the tone of his guitar ensures a lackluster mood when listening. The album is somber. I don't think the pick-up, tone, distortion, or chorus settings on his guitar were changed throughout the entire album. blah-blah-boring-blah."
5,Champions rule...,"This Golan-Globus 1983 movie was a bit tame for its day (my opinion), although many people were morally shocked by the story revelations. A good many these days would have some trouble understanding the references and outrage prompted by the unfolding drama. There is good chemistry between the actors most of the movie. It purports to be based on real incidents from a small town's 1957 Championship high school football team and is from a 1972 play by Jason Miller which ran for 988 performances. The play accumulated many praises and won the 1973 Tony Award for Best Play and received a 1973 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Those great many who like the movie compliment its humor, dialogue, and characters, but some people contend there problems with certain aspects of the play and find it distasteful. Whatever your reasons, be sure to watch That Championship Season and decide for your self."
4,"1999 TV Version! NOT Robert Mitchum, et al!","THIS IS THE 1999 TV VERSION THAT PAUL SORVINO DIRECTED & PLAYED THE COACH!!! Vincent D'Onofrio, Gary Sinese, Terry Kinney, & Tony Shaloub are the team members and each gave excellent performances but I had wanted to see the Robert Mitchum version so was a little disappointed."
1,NOT the original 82 MOVIE BE WARNED On Demand Viewers!!,(This review refers to the Video On Demand movie and is for those wanting to see the original movie.)The picture is right but the description is wrong so if you think you're getting to watch the great 1982 version which is described then think again before renting this! AMAZON bait and switch?????Thank goodness I have the right one at HOME because it (1982 version Mitchum Keach Sheen Dern) is truly a great movie!
2,Weak production of a great play,Those of us who are old enough to remember the dynamic original production of TCS can only be disapppointed by this disjointed film. Even the involvement of playwright Jason Miller didn't help.
3,Didn't work for me.,"I know that Dr. Oz recommends this for energy production if you have CFS, but it didn't do anything for me."
2,Side Effects,"Initially, I had a boost of energy with first time.Later after couple of days , I noticed intestinal pain. I tried product at half dosage every other day, but still had intestinal pain , but also inflammation in nerves in sinuses, and teeth.All my symptoms went away after discontinuing the the usage of the product.I have read on internet that some Cordyceps may be contaminated with mold. I do have mold allergy, and this may explain my reaction. I have use Reishi, Shitake,and Maitake mushrooms extracts without problem."
3,Sizing is way off,"Mrs. Davis ~ I ordered this for a new dress that I purchased. I made sure to look at the sizing chart and measure my bust appropriately. I am by no means over weight but am curvy. My size would have been a 34 but to be on the safe side I ordered a 38 expecting to hem a few seems to take it in. That is not the case. This is very, very snug on me. I am not sure if the sizing chart provided online is incorrect (I checked both Amazon and Vanity Fair's site) or if their sizing is just off. I am hoping to just make this item work but am disappointed."
5,it actually works,DDF fade gel cost 1/3 the price I paid for another product. Within a month or so the brown spot on the left side of my face (my car window side) is almost invisible. I re-ordered it.Jano 68Nebraska
2,had to stop use,"I would like to see if this product really works, but it made my face break out, so I had to quit using it. I may give it another shot in the winter, or try it on my hands."
4,True Genius,"Bud Powell does not get the mainstream attention won by such giants as Monk, but his talents at the piano playing bop are surpassed by none. This album is an excellent (and cheap!) way to hear his music. I bought this album for one song: ""Hallucinations"", which is his essential tune. The rest of the songs are good, (""Nightingale"", ""Oblivion"") but I don't need three takes of ""Tea for Two."" To each his own, though."
3,Poor durability ruined an otherwise good product,"I am a woodworker in a busy shop and when I ordered these headphones I looked forward to listening to the radio station of my choice as well as my mp.3 player while working. I have worn Peltor (a.k.a. AO Safety) headphones at work for a decade and have always been pleased, however my newest ""Race Tunes"" pair have developed a short in the wiring conecting the left and right speaker after less than six months of use. While it was working, I certainly enjoyed this product, but I am hesitant to replace it since it seems to have durability issues. I may be reduced to ear buds inside my normal hearing protection."
5,"Contender for ""The Great American Novel""","This is a marvelous opus into which you can really sink your teeth! Of course, I had seen the famous James Dean film version, but had no previous idea of what an expansive, sweeping epic it had been based on--- the book far surpasses the wonderful film. The incredible gift Steinbeck has for storytelling, the classic yet complex characters and the dramatic, original storylines will sweep you up page after page after page.It's especially satisfying to find a juicy read that lasts so long (this edition @ 600 pages) to bring you a fulfilling reading experience you can savor. The author's many pearls of wisdom and insightful spin on the Cain & Abel story will stay with you long after you finish. It's also a fascinating look at the foibles and fortunes of early 20th Century Americans. It's a book to enjoy and to share.I can't believe it took me so long to discover this literary treasure, which quickly leapt to the Top 10 List of my all-time favorites."
2,East of Eden,"It's sad to celebrate the 100th year of Steinbeck, and realize he wasnt that great of a writer. He is a story teller, but not a beautiful writer. East of Eden seems hurredly written, and I kept looking for a beautiful paragraph, a sentence that might make me read it several times. East of Eden was a real disappointment to me."
2,NOT BRAND NEW,"I generally love ordering bookd from Amazon however, this book arrived with a ripped cover. was not BRAND NEW, as advertised."
5,At last: An Oprah book I can agree with!,"This is a classic, but one younger generations of readers might easily overlook. I applaud Oprah for reviving interest in some great books from the past. This and The Little Red (Sox) Book, a revisionist history by that other classic writer, Bill ""Spaceman"" Lee are two must-read summer books!"
4,East of Eden grabs your attention,"East of Eden provides a interesting reading experience and never fails to suprise. The characters are all very complex and change throughout the story. It is about two families, the Trask's and the Hamilton's whose path meet in the Salinas Valley of California. East of Eden also parallels the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The rivalry between Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb directly parallels this story, the only difference being that Aron and Caleb (Adam's children) manage to resolve thier rivalry with each other. Cathy represents the evil character while Adam is the Ultimate good. Adam starts off very naive and gets taken advantage of by Cathy; and not until later does he finally become more aware and sees what Cathy really is. A theme in this novel is the need to be loved. Charles and Caleb, both feel that thier father's do not love them and this creates an extreme jealousy of Adam and Aron respectively."
4,East of Eden is deep reading,"East of Eden is a philosophical investigation into the human mental condition, emphasizing greatly the struggle between good and evil. It explores the complexities of such varied themes as depression, lonesomeness, hate (from Cain and Abel), and of course, love. But one should read this novel with a proverbial ¡grain of salt¡. Steinbeck will sometimes replace character development with his own analysis, much as a historian would look upon past events. For example, he begins a paragraph with ¡When I said Cathy was a monster¡.¡ To the reader, this may be an emotional anticlimax to the plot; it gives the tales a feeling of redundancy. Why not let the stories speak for themselves? It may be that Steinbeck is teaching us something with this novel, something important, something life changing C Timshel."
5,Classic Steinbeck...,"East of Eden is easily one of Steinbeck's best novels (and that's saying something considering how many great books he's wrote). The novel itself is an allegory following the Biblical accounts about the fall of man in the garden of Eden and Cain and Abel set in rural California. Although the book is quite long, its a fast and easy read. The only problem I had with the book is that Steinbeck, at times, tends to make the themes (free will vs. destiny) and the allegory a bit overly-obvious. But this is a minor point and its a great book (Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize shortly after this novel). I would highly recommend it and am glad that Oprah has brought this book out of the required reading lists for high school english and back into the public eye."
5,Too much for Oprah fans?,"A classic in ever sense of the word. A bit biography and a bit cathartic release, this novel is fantastic."
3,steinbeck's novel,"Steinbeck's heart-fulfilling allegory to the biblical story of Cain and Abel demonstrates the qualities and emotions of what it is to be human. The tension, jealousy, and agony are portrayed through characters who make up the entire spectrum of human characteristics. It is a tale of the emotional drama that persists within a family will leave readers engaged. East of Eden will take the reader on an emotional journey because it provokes thought and opinion, making it a piece hard to put down. The language of the novel is like an art which gives literal subjects an unique meaning and interpretation. Each character shows a part of human nature."
5,Wonderful story!,This story was great. I am suprised how well written it was. Fast read!! I loved the Chinese man's character! He was my favorite. A great personality. There's much to love about this book. It's enthralling and you won't be able to put it down.
3,Less than pristine,"New book arrived with markedly creased front cover. Less than perfect. When advertized as brand new, I am one to expect that the item will really appear as brand new. My ""new"" book did not."
4,Steinbeck's 2nd Best,"East of Eden beautifully captures several generations of America and it migration west. A little long-winded at times, though, I can't help but feel that Steinbeck got carried away because he didn't know where exactly he was headed, leaving us with a bit of a flat ending. Nonetheless, a great read -- although lacking in the poetic brevity ofThe Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics)"
5,I've read this book several times,"It is a sweeping story, covering the time period between the civil war and the First World War, and from Connecticut to California. It's interesting that Steinbeck himself is in the novel, and the Hamiltons, his mother's family, takes up half of the book. I wonder what is real and what is not, though everything except the twin's mother seems real. For example Steinbeck's mother's plane ride - was that a made-up story? Or is at least a part of it true? Could there be a real person like Cathy?It's a great book and I'll probably read again several years down the road."
5,A World of Old Lost Friends,"I have to put in my 2 cents for this classic. I can think of only two books which have created a world which has affected my soul as much as the real people in my life. One is Anna Karenina. The other is East of Eden. Steinbeck from the first page casts a spell. It is as if he is really telling his story of his ancestors, the Hamiltons. We are taken back to a post Civil War pastoral world with grassy scents and golden light. The prose is beautifully simple, rich, Mozartian. It is the most economical 700 page book I can think of. The ""joy of creation"" Steinbeck felt when writing it is evident. That joy makes up for its artistic flaws. I envy the readers who will be reading this novel for the first time. You're in for a treat."
3,"Heavy, but satisfying","This book is definitely not short on Biblical themes and references, but as someone who is - at best - agnostic, I wasn't put off at all by this. East of Eden is an obvious Steinbeck work, in that it does have a lot of the darker side of human-kind along with the turn-of-the-century California setting. The grandiose tale spans two families and three generations, with apt ties between all. It is a story of morality and brings up some questions about the soul and inner workings of us all. To me, it ultimately boils down to a story of hope, highlighted by the repeated mention of a single word, timshel, which equates to ""thou mayest."" It is this theme of choosing and controlling your own destiny that most captivated me, as well as the thoughts on acceptance and forgiveness."
5,East of Eden,"East of Eden is the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. For me, John Steinbeck is the VERY BEST WRITER EVER! His common sense and philosophical combination in print is better than any college course. A must read."
4,"Not Steinbeck's best, not his worst","I love Steinbeck and was excited to read this novel. Well, it wasn't his best. It is a very long book and I think there were less insights in the 600+ pages than in the 90 pages of ""The Pearl."" The major insight can be summed up as ""timshel"" meaning thou mayest. Mostly, the novel is about the Trask family... two brother, hmm, Caleb and Arron (?) anyway, Cain and Able. It's also a history of sorts of the Steinbeck family. One part I didn't like was the extreme sexism. Both in lack of female characters but also in the main female character (Kathy) being a cold-blooded... Sure, some women are mean..., but there are sweeping generalities about all women being teases, cold, etc etc. The parts about the Chinese man (Lee) are very good. Overall, I like other Steinbecks better... try Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men, The Wayward Bus, or Cannery Row. Just my opinion."
5,My favorite Book,This is one of the best books ever! I enjoyed it from cover to cover. It was amazing. I really loved the plot and I identified with the characters. The whole theme of forgiveness really touched me and it really made me think about everything. I would recommend this book to anyone.
3,"Very well done, Johnny","this book made me feel higher than ever. Grapes of wrath isn't half as good as this and I want to mention my appreciation for you, John."
5,Loved it!,"I LOVE this book! It is incredible. Arrived in amazing condition, A great read! Leaves me yearning for more and more."
5,Incredible!,"Steinbeck captures the simple truths about humanity in a compelling and intriguing story. I hadn't read any of his other books, and now I look forward to them all."
5,East of Eden,East of Eden is a book that I have santed to read for a long time but kept putting it off. I am so glad I purchased and read it recently. The sibling rivalary goes from generation to genertion just like Cain and Abel in the book of Genesis in the Bible. I certainly enjoyed the vivid iscriptions of the characters and landscapes in this book. The text is excellent.
5,Right up there with my all-time favorites,"I am so pleased and humbled by being led to this book. It is a reminder that there IS LOTS of great literature yet to discover. I honestly had forgotten. Rambling, melodramatic and FABULOUS, along the lines of Desire Under the Elms. I love, inhale and am treasuring every page. Has stirrings of Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose."
5,Inspired,"This book was one of the most passionate books I have ever read. John Steinbeck tells a moving tale of two brothers and how their lives are changed by the people around them. Initially sounding like the biblical story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck puts a new twist on the traditional story, compelling you to see the characters and your own life from a different perspective. It's amazing to witness your emotions and sympathies shift as the story progresses and it's thought provoking to see Steinbeck's distinction between good and evil. After you finish this book, you will find yourself going over and over the symbolism in the story, how the plots twists, and the insight into the sources of good and evil. This book ranks at the top of ""My Most Favorite Books of All Time"" list and will spend little time on my bookshelf as I re-read and re-read this book, gaining something new each time."
1,A horrendous novel,"I was surprised that this book was written by Steinbeck. For high school, I had to read this book during the summer and I had to put it down in the first few chapters. It didn't seem real and Cathy (the main women character) is so cold and evil. It is a dark novel that will make you cringe and throw up-well that's how I felt. The novel shows the worst in people through the characters."
1,Not for Me,"In spite of all the good reviews raving about this masterpiece, I don't like it and I'm not going to struggle with it anymore. If it does get interesting, I'll never know as I'm not going to continue. It was painful reading."
1,JDPariser knows exactly what he's talking about here,"Rarely have I encountered a review on Amazon that so completely describes me reaction to a book (or record) as JDPariser's review of this alleged ""masterpiece"". Quite simply, this is the single most over-rated novel in the canon of American literature. Let's face it; all of Steinbeck's novels are actually pretty bad. It's a miracle that he won any literary awards, let alone the Nobel Prize for Literature. The fact that Steinbeck's work so easily lends itself to animation (see the Warner Bros. cartoons inspired by ""Of Mice and Men""), gives you a hint of the complexity of Steinbeck's characterizations. Unfortunately, ""East of Eden"" lacks the excitement or interest to make a good cartoon. A must to avoid."
2,Hardly Steinbeck's Best,"It's a shame that Oprah chose this of all Steinbeck's novels to resuscitate her book club. 'East of Eden' is, in my opinion, Steinbeck's worst.This was Steinbeck's bid to enter the lofty realms of the 'serious' author. So it is predictably bleak and angst-ridden, its characters constantly mired in futility and frustration.How different from the far sunnier (and more distinctive) novels, 'Tortilla Flat' and 'Cannery Row' and 'Sweet Thursday' -- any of which would have been a more agreeable choice.....This is as close as Steinbeck comes to one of those potboiler sagas that just seem to go on and on and on, grinding through decade upon decade, and generation upon generation.Pick anything else by Steinbeck.Anything."
4,For those who loving writing,"I admit I am only 1/3 of the way through this book, but I have been so impressed with the depth of the writing, the color of the language and the art in play. While Steinbeck clearly is painting with broad brush strokes, and presents a simplified and overplayed image of woman as source of destruction/evil, I still find myself drawn in by the story and the substance of the book thus far. A good choice to kick off Oprah's Book Club again, if only to see a promising, flawed, and complex piece of fiction receive a wide audience. Kudos to her for bringing a work like this to the masses."
4,Reader from Veradale,Oprah got me to read this classic. It is her first pick in the new beginning of her book club. I really liked the book and had a hard time putting it down once I started it. It really made me think about what influences we have on the way a child can end up with the background that Caleb and Aron had. Sad how Cathy was a influence without even raising her boys. Lee was the only good role model and stable enough to keep the family together.
5,Wonderful book with wonderful characters.,What a fun book. Steinbeck creates memorable characters in a sweeping soap opera. If Oprah gets more people to read this one then more power to her. Don't even think about watching the movie instead of reading the novel. The movie leaves out all of the juicy stuff.
2,disappointing,It is surprising that so many people seem to love this book. I found it drifted from place to place and ended up feeling like a bad soap opera. The layers of analogy and metaphor wash over you as you go through it. Probably a good beach book but if you have other things you are interested in they will likely be more satisfying.
3,Grammer/Spelling? Am I the only one who noticed??,"I am only 1/4 through the book and have already noticed a very obvious misspelling and periods where there should be commas, etc. I think the editor should've done a little more homework. I know it shouldn't bother me, but it does. Call me crazy......"
5,Absolutely Incredible,"Long before Oprah and her book club, I was a kid in school and ran out of books to read. My Mom had the whole collection and I grumbled at the plain dictionary-type covers. Little did I know that I was about to read a collection of the most magical author I've ever known. East of Eden is something that you can only experience yourself. It's my favourite out of all Steinbeck's novels (and there isn't one bad Steinbeck book that's not good). I recommend this to you, your family, your friends, your children. I think everyone should read this book once in their lifetime."
5,Oprah? Who knew?,"A fantasic novel with enough twists, turns, descent, heart ache and mental anguish to entrain even the average 21st Centruy reader.I have always enjoyed Steinbeck and after completing ""East of Eden"" I truly believe that he is one of, if not the quintessential American author. As accomplished as Hemmingway and Salinger are, Steinbeck has a gift for relating to the most common-place among us. His descriptive talents are unmatched and his flair for the dramatic is remarkable.If you have a few days and are in the market for a fantastic novel by one of our contry's finest authors I must suggest ""East of Eden."""
5,Meaningful insight into human relations,"These book is one of the greatest clasics you can come across. It is a serene insight in relationship on man-women and brotherhood issues. Though is not very crystal on answering the question why the main character is so sentimentaly naive and as such against all odds, but still the situation, the consequences of it are colorfuly depicted. It's a book how Good can survive against the Evil but still it gets the shorter end of it. There is no ideal or divine realization that good will win overall. Being truly and naivly good doesn't mean that you will be awerded for it and that a true love can win at the end. It can be farse to itself."
5,There is a reason this book is a classic...,"This book has everything that a good read should possess. It's dramatic, ironic, entertaining, holds meaning, makes one feel and is beautifully written."
4,Good but not Great,"I was ready to read a classic and almost at the same time Oprah opened up with this one. (I usually read historicial/romance and needed a change) I have to say there are times when I cannot put the book down and others where the story is exceptionally slow. It is also a dark story, more evil and dissapointment and death then good, even though it gets its point across. I am enjoying it, only 3/4 the way through, but so far, it is so-so. Grapes of Wrath was much better. Hopefully there is a happy ending, but I doubt it.***************************************************************Finished the book, glad I read it and also glad it is over. The end really picks up speed and is quite entertaining, but the ending is so-so. Maybe I am missing something, but still liked Grapes of Wrath better."
5,Amazing,"I loved this book. My favorite Steinbeck book (have read Of Mice and Men, Cannery Row, The Grapes of Wrath and The Moon is Down). I read The Grapes of Wrath just prior and I found Eden to be the better of the two. It was a book that I had trouble putting down. The characters were great."
3,Not The Read I Expected -- Disturbing,"With much regret I am reporting that I did not like this book. I know I am an anomaly from all the other positive reviews this book has received. I came to read this book upon the prompting of my mother and sister who both enjoyed the book immensely.I stopped reading ""East of Eden"" the other day. I just couldn't take the brutal nature of some of the characters. I do not remember feeling so upset and disturbed when I read ""Grapes of Wrath"" ""The Red Pony"" or ""the Pearl"". That was a long time ago so my memory has been dimmed by the years maybe it was in those books as well.I wonder if the character Kathy/Kate was the summation of all the horrible women Steinbeck ever knew. Reading page after page of the demented things she did was just too much for me to justify the read."
5,One of the 5 Greatest Novels Ever Written,"Perhaps every great novelist has one truly great novel. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is outstanding, but ""East of Eden"" is Steinbeck's best novel and one (1) of the five (5) greatest novels ever written (in my opinion).Not only does Steinbeck make Genesis Chapter 4 the centerpiece of this novel, he literally wagers the success of this novel on one (1) Hebrew word found in Genesis Chapter 4: ""Timshel"" (""thou mayest""). Steinbeck wins the wager. Actually, he breaks the casinos-all of them-at Vegas by basing his novel around ""Timshel.""This book is a stunning work of achievement. If you enjoy fiction, you should love ""East of Eden."""
5,Possibly the Best Work of Fiction in the 20th Century,"This is my favorite work of fiction, and I think it could be in contention for the best work ever."
5,East of Eden Changed my life. The best book of all time,What can I say about East of Eden. This book is a masterpiece. This book made me love reading. I have never in my life become so envolved in a story. I recommend this book to everyone. If you pass this book by you will be denying yourself a truly wonderful experience. The story is timeless and thrilling.
4,"A ""boring masterpiece""","There were times, in the middle of the book, when I was so bored by the writing style and I wanted to stop reading it. But I was patient and it paid off. At times I wanted to give the novel two stars, then three stars, then four stars, and it probably deserves a full mark. But I'm keeping it at four stars to tell some readers, especially those who haven't read classics before, that it's not an easy read.I've read ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons"" by Dan Brown before reading this. They were entertaining throughout, but you forget them the moment you finish them. East of Eden, although boring at times, had an impact on me and changed the way I look at life. It just gives you wisdom and a new perspective. And that's what makes a book a great book. I may revisit this epic again."
5,Best Steinbeck I've read!,"When I first picked up East of Eden, I was not sure that I would enjoy it. The first 40 or so pages did not hold my attention, but it seems that once I turned to page 41, I was HOOKED and could not put the large novel down until it was done.The stories of the Hamiltons and Trasks intersect so beautifully and Lee's character is one that I will probably remember forever. So many of his observations about Americans and California are ones that were true in the 1900s and continue to ring true a century later. I highlighted many passages in this book as ones that I won't forget and would recommend this book to anyone."
1,What?,"I find it hard to read a book whose characters I have not respect for. I never had any reason to care what happened to these people.That is what I wrote, when I read the 1st 1/2 of the book. I hated the first 1/2, but then when I read the 2nd half it was a lot better... But it won't let me change my review..."
1,A story?,I thought this book was a waste of my time. it may have emotion... but it is riddled with chapters that contain little relevance to the plot! Save yourself and don't bother.
1,Awful and yukky,This book was yellow and old. I did not want to touch it and threw it away. Condion of book appaling.
4,"""very entertaing and amusing""","I really enjoyed reading this book because it gave me the chance to live the life of Adam Task and his many adventures.As I read the book I was never able to put it down,from Adam going off to join the war or coming back to his brother to fix their troubled past.Overall,I really enjoyed reading about the lives of the Trasks and how they became one of the most richest people of the Salinas Valley,along with Samuel Hamilton!!!""I would really recomend this book to anyonelooking for a book with plenty of humor or a sence of humor""!!!!!"
3,Not quite 'very good',"Labeled 'Very Good', but it was well-beaten around the edges, but otherwise ok. Different edition than advertised, but I didnt mind."
5,Possibly the Best Fictional Book I've Ever Read...,"This is one of those books you must read some time during your life-- probably twice (once in your youth, and another in old age). Read it."
5,"""greatest book ever""","I actually bought this for my wife. She reads every night before going to sleep and according to her this is the best book she has ever read. She commented on the writing as being very desciptive and making her feel like she was there. ""A very satifying read"""
3,Penguin edition has too many errors!,"The book is great, don't get me wrong. The problem is that the centennial edition published by penguin has typos. Lots and lots of typos. An embarrassing amount of typos. Great literature deserves better proofreading."
3,Relationships,"This was a good book but I cannot rave about it. I enjoyed wondering about Adam Trask's life with its ups and downs. The characters were very fascinating and the story line easily fit many of the characters into the events naturally. Yet, in this day and age, there seems little astonishing about the book. The whorehouse and the description of Cathy/Kate are heard everyday from city life. I hear about more unusual lives from the morning news. Yes, I know unusualness was not the purpose of this book. It was written so that we can see how relationships, lies, and love affect the normal and abnormal person (if there is such a thing). Relationships become the corner stone of our lives and build us to our full potential or in some cases break us down to nothing. So, choose your friends and family wisely."
3,Why Hate Steinbeck?,"I thought the review below by bluejaye99 to be particularly interesting. I dont think Steinbeck is in the absolute top rank (with, say James or Faulkner or Twain) but he is a fine story teller who uses words much more fluidly than most American writers. Yes, this book has its clumsy parts, but it is easy to read and makes an impressive beach book."
5,One of my all time ten best!,Great book with fully developed characters and moving plot. His use of language inspires deep thought and joy on so many turns.
5,Spellbinding,"A brilliant story told with passionate prose. I couldn't put it down. The characters are so deep and so strong and so seductive in their musings, madness, and greed that I had to know what they were going to do next. And Steinbeck does not dissapoint."
5,Steinbeck goodness,This is the best book I've read so far. Steinbeck is amazing at drawing you into the story. I recommend this book to everyone.
5,Excellent condition,"We received this book in great shape before the expected delivery date, which was an unexpected pleasure. It was a School required read, and I got it at a great price."
5,East of Eden,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Our book club had a lively discussion about it. Steinbeck made his characters come alive as did the various settings. It's timeless!
4,Good vs. Evil,"I enjoyed this book. Steinbeck used Genesis and the story of Cain and Abel as a setting for the characters in this novel. It is amazing the magnitude of abuse a parent can thrust on a child, how a child can endure that abuse, then end up being horribly abused by a spouse who also had no maternal instinct or feelings whatsoever for their children. Her lack of any emotion at all except hate almost makes Cathy inhuman, an evil presence that those around her feel, but can't quite put their finger on what is different about her. All that to say that this novel carries some very difficult subjects. In smaller amounts, it carries the love and devotion of family."
2,A series again?,"I have to agree that this trend toward series of books going through all the ""Treks"" is annoying. I have tended to not buy them even though I have a huge Star Trek book collection. I am a ST:TNG fan and do not enjoy reading the other series books as much. It seems like the publisher is trying to force me to read them in order to make sense of any single title.I understand the marketing strategies here but I wish there were more stand alone titles in any single Trek series. Making me wait 6-8 months for a new title leaves me looking for other types of reading material and not Trek.This book is okay but is a little to confusing for most of us. I recommend skipping it and waiting for a book you can sink your teeth into without 6 other for backround material."
2,Slow Start and Only Average Finish,"Of the five I've read (excluding Challenger), this was the most disappointing Gateways book. I am a huge TNG fan, but this book was very slow.I enjoyed Troi as Captain, but that was about it. And the crew of her ship had some personality.This book and the Deep Space 9 version, were the most integrated of the Gateways series. Between the two, most of the Gateways story is told, prior to the conclusion in book 7 and you will definitely want to read the conclusion. If you like a series, read these two for sure. You may not need to read Voyager, or New Frontier. If you don't like a series, these are the two to avoid. See my review on the others."
4,A Modern Male's Point of View,"Mothers everywhere should read this well researched book on what it takes to contend with modern demands - technologically, culturally & personally. Dr. Heather Paxson's exploration deserves our attention.Gisbert E Helmreich"
2,Millions could have written this same book.,"There are a million stories in the naked city. This is one of them.This is a rendition of the author's screwy childhood in some podunk town in Missouri. If the Methodists weren't making his life miserable the Baptists were. So by the time he was 16 years old or so he realized old time religion was a load and that hell was just made up to scare people into being controlled.So, as I said, millions could have written this book. Including moi. Reading this book was kind of like reliving my childhood under the thumb of the Baptists. So I didn't care for it. Too many bad memories.I don't recommend it. Better to ignore religion instead.I've not read any of this author's other books but I did see the movie Gangs of New York and that was quite entertaining so I can only suppose the book is also."
4,A Brain Above the Rest,"This is not your average book. Richard Endier is not your average man. A plot of fast-paced action and intrigue takes place in The Spider's Test. The Spider, a fear inspiring awnshegh has focused its terrible gaze upon Richard. Revenge is foremost on its mind. For Richard Endier, the simple farm boy destined for greatness, has tricked, out-witted, and humiliated the Spider again and again. The Spider's main weapon is the fear it inspires, so it cannot a simple farm boy who has tricked it repeatedly live. When Richard creates a frontier settlement near the Spider's domain, the awnshegh sees the perfect opportunity for revenge. With only himself and his friends to protect themselves, the only way Richard can save even himself is by tricking the Spider yet again, this time with the biggest riddle of all."
5,GREAT ADD-ON,"I recently bought a bike and as I was riding and braked behind this guy in a bike and his brake light would FLASH. I'd never seen that feature B4 and I loved it. I researched and came up to this little device. I bought it, went to my local bike shop and installed it. It was great my buddies loved it soo much they all bought one too. Great safety item."
