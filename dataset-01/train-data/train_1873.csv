2,4 in 1 grill,This product did not live up to the expectation. The sandwich maker is messy and whatever you place between 2 pieces of bread leaks all over and does not stay within the bread pieces-like cheese-even with 1 slice it is messy. Not at all what I expected. Thought the edges would be sealed.
2,The same poor experience as other reviewers,"I recently threw this away after owning it for 8 months using it an average of once/week. I threw it away because the non-stick coating was coming off on the griddle and grill plates. Before that, I had pretty much given up on the waffle plates because as another reviewer said, the machine did not get hot enough to cook the waffle all the way. It was low cost, and I did get some use out of it, but was never very satisfied even before it began peeling."
1,Don't purchase this item.,"While the sellers were more than nice, this product is a total flop. The grill does not heat up enough to make a crisp waffle. I spoke to them and they sent another grill but it did the same thing. I mailed both of them back and was refunded the price of a waffle iron but lost money on mailing as I had to return two! Product does not even rate a single star! Donna"
1,Is there a rating for a 1/2 star? No stars?,"Tried the panini sandwich plates.......they never would brown. Tried the belgian waffle plate the following night and there seemed to be hope, except that only the center of the waffle would brown and the outsides wouldn't darken. So I flipped the waffles so the outsides were to the center to darken their color a little bit. then I realized that the whole process took 30 minutes.....30 MINUTES!!!! FOR 1 STUPID WAFFLE! Piece of junk. DO NOT BUY"
1,Total crap..buyers beware,I bought this unit and thought will be good. It took 13 min to heat up a simple sandwitch and then entire outer surface gets heated so much. And it never worked after one time use. Had to return the product. Was very disappointed.
2,Check it out,This unit wasnt up to expected quality. It doent heat up very well. Thats the reason I gave it a 2 star.
2,Not a great product,"This 4 in 1 grill is slow to heat up, slow to cook. Can't imagine doing steaks on it. A Sandwich took 20 minutes and still was only lightly brown. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,This thing is terrible!,"I feel awful giving a gift a bad review, but here I go. My mom bought this for my family as a gift because our 25 year old waffle iron finally gave up the ghost and started shorting out. I was making waffles every weekend for my family and she thought we would find a lot of utility in this item.Problem is, it doesn't make ANYTHING well. It just doesn't get hot enough. It's a terrible waste of money and I feel awful that my mother spent her money on it for us!"
2,"Total Chef Sandwich, Waffle,Grill & Griddle",I got use it once next morning I got up and told my grandson we would have waffles in the morning thank God I kept my old waffle iron cause I plugged it in and it didn't even light up
1,4 in 1 grill,This is a piece of junk! I gave it to my daughter in law for her birthday and was embarrased at what a piece of junk it was. Tried to make pancakes on the grill and it wouldn't even brown them. Didn't have my receipt so I couldn't send it back.
3,I Blame GEFFEN!!!!!!,"In the 80's, Geffen Records picked up a bunch of English bands, and in EVERY signing, they sent an A&R guy to them and said, 'Look. If you want to make it big in America, you must do this, this , and THIS.' Many band quickly lost their 'edge' thanks to this A&R guy, but none did it so quickly, and as sadly as FUZZBOX. This complilation is proof of how a band can eisily be swayed by a major to abandon their origonal and unique stlye and shoot their carrer in the foot. Buy and cry! I did"
1,DVD disc doesn't play,"The music cd part works, but the dvd disc doesn't work, my dvd player says "" Disc error"" -Please eject this disc- playback feature may not be available on this disc"" I'm very unhappy, I paid all this money out for this cd/ dvd set and then the dvd disc not working. Now what do I do?? Can't use the dvd now. PS just found out that the dvd is a PAL format that only works in Eroupe NOT in the USA. We the USA only can use NTSC Format. So if your from the USA and buy this dvd it will not work here in the US. And there is no way you can use the dvd, so you are just wasting money on a dvd that doesn't work and won't work for us here in the US. So don't let people fool you and say that the dvd works here in the US with any other dvd player. The dvd players here in the US won't play PAl which is what this DVD is. Just a waste of money on a dvd that you can never use. Now the cd works but not the DVD."
3,Delayed shipping,"Please go ahead and send Easy Money when it comes in...Is that a positive? I don't know another way to O.K. delayed shipment. It did not work on my computer. Thanks, The Perrys"
4,They travel with me,"I take these small packs with me whenever I travel. They are great for sanitizing hotel room bathrooms, remote controls, and door knobs. I also put a pack in my children's suitcases, for the same purpose."
4,Enjoyable and informative journey,"This was my introduction to this National Geographic series of locale based books written by famous authors. I chose this one because it is from my region. I would recommend it, particularly if you do live in the southwestern region of the US. It was good, but I also really liked (maybe more), Oaxaca Journal from Oliver Sacks. Instead of writing about neurology as his readers have come to know him for, he wrote about his ferns in Mexico. Check that one out too."
1,More of the same moon-eyed junk.,"Yet another book that regurgitates the same badly-managed studies about qi gong, acupuncture, and prayer. About five of these come out every year, and this one's no different. The prayer study, for instance, had no control group; acupuncture has never been clinically shown to have any effect on disease, and only a slight effect on pain management (possibly due to a mild release of endorphins); and so on. It's all the same junk.There's no question that HMOs and doctor-patient relationships are bad. Part of the reason people feel subjectively better when tended to by an ""alternative"" doctor is because of the length and quality of the attention, and has nothing to do with the ""healing"" itself. Let's do something about the crummy doctor-patient system, so that people won't turn to out-and-out quackery and unscientific nonsense to feel like they're getting medical attention."
3,Skinny Puppy is amazing! Nettwerk is lame lame lame!,"I'd seen the video for Dig It years ago and was so happy to see this dvd release -- I didn't even know these guys had made eight videos! And, while I'm thrilled to see these interesting and rather devastating videos with these awesome songs, I don't think I've ever had a worse dvd experience. Not only are there no extras, there aren't even any basics, like menus, and no accompanying booklet.Music and videos: 5 starsDVD treatment: 0 starsSkinny Puppy deserves better."
2,SKINNY PUPPY = THE BEST! NETTWERK = SAD JOB!,"First of all, the only reason this did not get 5 stars is NOT because of the band (Skinny Puppy, the godfathers of EBM INDUSTRIAL) but is because of the utter LACK by the label NETTWERK that did NOTHING but put the VHS version on DVD without ANY MENUS, GRAPHICS, NOTHING EXTRA!the videos themselves are 5 stars!if you have the VHS tape, there is NO NEED to buy the DVD!if you don't have the VHS, you might want to pick it up if you've never seen these MTV-style videos... although there are a LOT of videos NOT included, which is a shame since NETTWERK had YEARS to get a specail DVD version released. NETTWERK IS THE WORST RECORD LABEL EVER BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PRIDE IN THEMSELVES OR FOR THE ARTISTS THAT USED TO BE THEIR MEAL TICKET! (that is until Sarah McLachlan came around then ALL the other artists under NETTWERK's control were ignored by the label!) SKINNY PUPPY & DWAYNE R.I.P."
3,where'd they all go?,"i got this video and to my suprise over half their videos were not there. the have the esential testure, but where the hell is worlock? but its alright i guess."
5,EXCELLENT VIDEOS!,"I've been a Skinny Puppy fan since 1997! These videos are just plain awesome! If you have ever listened to Skinny Puppy, you probably know that they have their own unique style of music that fits in its own genre of music, and the videos on this DVD are just as creative as the music."
1,Terrible!!,"A whole lot of noise and nothing to show for it. This sharpener is dull, slow, noisy and takes F_O_R_E_V_E_R to sharpen a pencil. I returned it right away."
2,Not as I expected,"I had great hopes for this sharpener but I am disappointed. You have to push pretty hard on the pencil to activate the cutters. The sharpener makes a high pitched squealing sound as it sharpens which is very annoying. The auto-stop feature is shaky. There is no way to really know when the pencil is done. Just have to keep checking it, same as any other sharpener. I would not buy this again."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This sharpener stopped working not long after purchase. I called Bostitch to request a replacement and found their return policy expenditure laden, with an exorbitant turn around time which deepens customer inconvenience for faulty products. The price to ship item back along with a two month turn around is not worth the effort. Largely disappointing was Bostitch's lack of customer friendly product support. Clearly they will only stand behind a defected product only after swimming through a sea of red tape. NO MORE BOSTITCH products for our company! BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
4,"Sturdy, though only allows for a certain sharpening window","The term ""heavy duty"" is misleading here. I really think the makers need to test this thing in an elementary school classroom where pencil sharpening is a common occurence.This is a sturdy tool that gets the job done quite nicely. My only complaint is that only about ten pencils can be sharpened before it refuses to take anymore. I suppose this does prevent an early burn-out, but it can be frustrating on those times when there needs to be mass sharpening done."
4,Great sharpener,"This is a great sharpener, it is a nice size and works great, would buy again, I haven't had any problems with it."
1,Terrible,Never worked right put pencil in one minute and half later still trying to sharpen one pencil with no pencil lead showing Then it didn't work at all
3,"Not so quiet, but works fine","Hey I got this 2nd-hand and it works fine, sharpens pencils well. As a teacher I was looking for something that was really quiet so as not to disrupt what's going on in class, and this one makes a bit more sound than I would like."
3,"Great sharpener, ZERO product support","Great pencil sharpener for at home use. Fast and kid friendly. We had this sharpener for almost 2 years when my children managed to throw out the pencil shavings collection cup when emptying the sharpener. The sharpener has a ""safety switch"" and won't work without the cup in place. I tried calling Amax office products at 800-343-9329 and e-mailing Bostich about a replacement part, but there is no answer at the 800#, and the mailbox says it's full. If you want to take your chances, go ahead and buy, but if you expect any product support whatsoever, stay away!"
4,"Quiet As Promised, And It Works, Too!","Between years of homeschooling and now public school, we've gone through a lot of pencil sharpeners in our house. Manual ones are frustrating and messy, and even some of the electric sharpeners we've had just don't sharpen well. This one does what it's supposed to -- gives your pencil a fine, nice point -- without making a mess, and without hurting your ears.I love it when a product does what it promises!"
3,Works well for 3/4 of a school year.,"This is the best I have found :-( I wish that meant more. It lasts a whole school year, but then it starts to get dull. I would guess the last one sharpened over 1000 pencils before it started fading. The good news is that I had the one from the year before and got it out, and it worked at least as well. So do the math... It will last for 1000 pencils."
2,Hard to use,"I bought this thinking it would be a powerful sharpener. It takes a lot of pressure to sharpen pencils. The unit will move backwards unless you have it against a solid surface. I have a battery operated sharpener that work better, without the hassle."
1,Piece of Junk,"After about a month of regular use in the classroom, the sharpener would often overheat and turn off. Then the sharpener would not turn off. When taking it apart to see what was wrong, the cheap plastic microscopic switch was broken off the other cheap piece of little copper. Don't buy this, it's an Executive Piece of Junk."
1,don't buy this one,"doesn't sharpen all sizes of pencils!!! the standard #2 pencils are just OK butif the pencil is just a little smaller or just a little larger, it doesn't do a goodjob...only one side of the pencil gets sharp & the other is wood...or, it feels like isspins around some pencils...i would not advise any one to buy this, i feel like it was a waste of mymoney & i wouldn't have a family member or friend spend their money on it eitherit says it's ""quietsharp"" that's probably because no one uses it"
2,not as good as i thought,This sharpender is not really that good. My pencils don't get a nice sharp at all. I already messed a few pencils trying to work this thing.
2,Not much better than a bad manual one,"For $20.00 it should sharpen a pencil evenly. Nope. That's all I wanted. I could deal with noise, time. But not half the wood meeting the tip of the lead due to uneven sharpening. It will drive you crazy."
2,Good enough- if you turn the pencil,"I must say I was a little disappointed in this Stanley Bostitch pencil sharpener. I expected more than one blade just from the weight of the sharpener. It seems like a very heavy duty one and has a nice sized shavings dispenser. However, the pencils come out sharp all up one side but the other side doesn't have the wood pulled back from the lead at all. We have found we have to manually rotate the pencil while it is in the sharpener to get an even sharpening. It's a little inconvenient since that doesn't always work either."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The only good thing I can say about this product is that it is heavy enough to stay in one place while you are trying to sharpen a pencil.It does not sharpen the pencil evenly no matter how you hold or turn the pencil. As you try to adjust the pencil for even sharpening, it has a voracious appetite for the pencil.This is the second Bostich Electric Pencil Sharpener I have purchased. I thought the first one was just an abberation. Unfortunately, it was no better than this one. I thought second time around would be better. (The first one was purchased from another well-known office supply store).Again, save your money. There has to be something better than Bostich out there."
1,Did not work in the classroom.,"I needed an affordable and efficient pencil sharpener for my classroom. It sharpened some pencils, but others on only one side. It started getting louder after only a week. 20 minutes fter sharpening 21 pencils in a row, it randomly turned on and would not shut off without unplugging it. Now even if plugged in, it won't stop running and doesn't sharpen any pencils. Only lasted 4 weeks and sharpened less than 100 pencils."
4,Stanley Bostitch QuietSharp Executive Electiric Pencil Sharpener,"I think this is great option. Although, it's notquiet when I sharp the pencils. However, itdoes sharp quickly. I get high quality sharppencils out of it.Takako Masuda"
1,not reliable,"I am a third grade teacher, and I needed some very good pencil sharpeners for my kids. These had good reviews so I thought I would try them. It has only been about 2 months, and all three of them that I ordered do not sharpen well anymore and they also start running during my classes which is very distracting. Now I have to buy more sharpeners and I definitely did not get what I paid for... $20 each."
1,"Slow, wears out immediately","The sharpener is good for maybe a dozen uses at best, but still slow for those first dozen. After that, good luck getting anything out of it. Very cheaply made, breaks easily, and is not at all quiet. This is an absolute waste of money."
1,Shimmies while sharpening,"The Good:It's powerful. And it's quiet, for a pencil sharpener. So it lives up to that part of its promise.The Bad:It's hard to keep pencils from spinning as I hold them in the sharpener. The motor and blades aggressively shake the pencil from side to side, and you need a Kung-Fu grip to hold on. I could deal with that, since the powerful motor and sharp blades at least work quickly. However, every pencil that goes in this machine comes out with one side of the point still covered with wood and the other side very deeply exposing the lead. I have another pencil sharpener that never does this, and I tried the same pencils on both my regular sharpener and this one, so I know it's the machine and not the pencil. Also, the shavings tray is pretty small.The Ugly:Actually, this is one of the most attractive pencil sharpeners I've seen. It has everything going for it...if only it could sharpen a pencil properly."
1,Stopped working after 4 pencils,"I agree with the negative comments. We used this sharpener for 4 pencils before it stopped working. It didn't work again until I had unplugged it and let it sit for at least 15 minutes. In my household, my 3 children sharpen their huge big of colored pencils endlessly. This simply will not do. I did not purchase it from Amazon, but from Office Depot. It is getting returned today!"
2,Don't buy. Collecting dust.,"For an office that rarely uses pencil, I expect this thing to last longer. Nope. I think it sharpened $3 worth. That's how much it should cost."
1,Junk!,"I bought this hoping to have a decent pencil sharpener for the new school year. When I put a pencil in it the motor locks up and you get a buzzing noise. Sometimes it turns but never has it completely sharpened a pencil. It is just another piece of junk from China. Buy a manual one, don't waste your money."
1,DOA,"The product was Dead on Arrival. I plugged it in, inserted a pencil, it made a sad, almost pathetic sound, and failed to sharpen my pencil. Oh, and it smells like burnt rubber."
4,Pretty Good Pencil Sharpener--Not for Heavy Use,"It took a while to sharpen my first pencil, maybe 15 seconds compared to the usual 10 seconds. It was quiet, compared to many other sharpeners, but you compomise speed for quiet. The pencil did come out nice and sharp and the mechanical action during sharpening was smooth. I didn't have to rotate the pencil as I usually do with most sharpeners in order to get an even point. I can't say how long it will last, which is the main problem with most sharpeners I purchase. It is rather heavy, but it keeps the sharpener moving while in use. Only time will tell if it will sharpen over time. I can say, if you are a teacher getting this for your class, I would rethink that position. I don't believe it will hold up to the constant sharpening needs of many students throughout the day."
4,Good Sharpener,"This is a difficult product to review because I have no idea how long it will last, or how long the sharpening mechanism will stay sharp. But as it stands right now, I am impressed with this sharpener. I read the reviews and wonder if we have the same product. This sharpened pencils quickly and quietly with a minimum of ""push"" on my part. I sharpened pencils that were brand new so had no previous point and was really impressed with the speed. I found this to be exactly what the box said, quick and quiet."
5,Great SALSA Music,"Since I have a GREAT LOVE for nostalgia Puerto Rican music I am always searching my list for the next cd to purchase. I may go to a music store to search for a cd I am looking for, but 9 out 10 times I do not have the slightest idea what is all in the cd. So when I shop for a cd on Amazon I am very well pleased how Amazon permits me, the customer, to sample tidbits of the music . It hepls me make the right choice and an accuret decision to purchase or not. 10 out of 10 times when I make my purchase on Amazon I am always delighted to know that I did make the right choice and will forever enjoy the product."
1,Bo-o-o-o-o-ring,"Absorbing fable?? I was barely able to finish this book. I kept thinking, ""It has to get better."" It never did. Luckily it was bought on clearance."
2,Not a versatile film,"This film is just not that great. The colors aren't very accurate, instead shifting more towards green/blue, and the latitude isn't very good, either (half a stop, maybe?) Coupled with the fact that it is only 160 speed, this film is pretty much useless unless it is the only thing you have. The Kodak Gold 200 you get at supermarkets takes more accurate colors than this film.It is punchy, like slide film, but if you want slide film, use slide film. If you want a good negative film, use Reala. But not this."
3,Nth West Coast Indian Art: Thomas Burke,The book is deep and a chore to read. The analysis goes beyond a simple appreciation of the art and meanings.
4,A good explanation of the philosophy and intent of Tai Chi,"This book has less to do with the physical part of Tai Chi practice and more of the history and philosophy of the art. The author explains such concepts as Chi, Jing, and their uses for martial arts applications. The Tai Chi classics are translated here with explanation and additional comments. I found these first sections of the book especially useful. The book concludes with a description of the form - but I do not recommend learning Tai Chi from a book; seek out a qualified instructor."
4,T'ai Chi,Bought this as a gift for my mother in law becuase she takes T'ai Chi. It was a great way for her to learn more about the history of Tai chi...
3,check part#'s before ordering.,This bug shield was sent to me by amazon accidentally I ordered a different part number and was sent this one because the descriptions and product pictures are the same for both part#'s. So be careful when ordering. As for the bug shield in question didn't use it I returned it. See my review on bugflectorII part#63025 for correct part#'s.
4,Wonderful Detail... Paint Flaking,"This looks wonderful in the garden leading to our front door and matches a couple of other boy/girl statuettes we have. I am very pleased with the size (it is quite large) and details on the piece. Though we have only had the piece set up for about a month, I noticed that the paint is peeling off the top of the boy's head. Since the paint is an off white and the underlying material is white, I'm not terribly concerned but that is a bit of a disappointment. Overall, very much like the item!"
5,sweet garden sight,"I love this sweet garden sight in my yard. I received my order and the little girl's leg was broken. I contacted the seller and he responded quickly and shipped me a new little girl without requesting I ship back the broken item. I have a big shade garden and put the statue in the center. This statue brightens up the garden and brings a smile to any onlooker. The scene reembles many childhood memories for me when visiting my grandmother. She had a similar teetor-totter that actually went up and down and round and round. I love the durability of the statue, size, and easy assembly of the parts. I will purchase from this seller again in the future both for product quality and customer service!"
5,Better than I thought,When I opened this statue I couldn't believe how wonderful it looked. The children looked so real and the facial expressions made me smile. I put this statue where everyone can see this with an arrangement of flowers. I wanted everyone to smile like I do when I see this darling statue. It has rained like crazy this month and it has held up nicely in the crappy weather. I have a few more that I need to purchase and will go with this product only. Very Happy with the results....
5,Excellent,"This was an excellent addition to our front yard. Everyone comments on how nice it looks. It is not heavy, as it is made out of plastic or some other material (not stone). It stays in place, though. Highly recommend it."
2,Great disappointment,"I think previous reviews of these performances of the Triple Concerto and particularly of the Piano Trio Op. 11 were over enthusiastic. Anyone interested in understanding the reasons of my disappointment with the Eroica Trio, should listen and compare the interpretation of the Op. 11 by the Stern-Isotomin-Rose Trio. They set the gold standard (Sony Classical SM2K 64513). Music will tell you more than words.Muzio ClementiBeethoven: Triple Concerto, Op. 56; Piano Trio, Op. 11"
1,Not dripless,"These candles are described as dripless but they do, indeed, drip all over creating a big red mess. The shape is nice and they fit into my candle holders but would not buy again due to their drippy nature."
2,Nothing I couldn't play myself...,"The selections on this CD are wonderful, however Wayne Gratz does nothing phenomenal with the pieces that would merit buying this CD, unless you like to just listen to the music. If you play piano, just buy the sheet music and record yourself. That way you can get the credit and don't have to shell out the money to listen to an over-rated piano player."
4,Great hard to find songs on this CD!,Songs on CD are:1. Soul Sister Brown Sugar - Sam & Dave2. Dock of the Bay - Percy Sledge3. Every Beat of My Heart - Gladys Knight4. When a Man Loves a Woman - Percy Sledge5. Wonderful World - The Drifters6. Ain't No Sunshine - Al Jarreau7. Try Me - James Brown8. My Guy - Mary Wells9. Spanish Harlem - Ben E King10. Sixteen Candles - The Crests11. Operator - Gladys Knight12. Save the Last Dance for Me - The Drifters13. I Who Have Nothing - Ben E King14. Oh Girl - Chi-Lites
3,OK Bike Shorts,"On the plus side, these shorts are reasonably priced.On the negative side, the padding is so thick and extends so far in the front that I feel like I am wearing a diaper when I am walking in them. But, to be fair, you don't buy them to walk in. They are adequately comfortable on the bike for short rides (less than 20 miles). I haven't taken them on longer rides yet because there hasn't been nice enough weather yet this year but it feels like there might be some chaffing near the front of the pad. I don't think the thick pad provides any additional comfort over shorts with a conventional chamois. Since I have only riden in cool weather, I can't comment on how well they will wick away moisture.I would recommend these shorts to those who are getting their first biking shorts and don't expect to do more than short rides."
3,Great value,"These shorts are a great value. The quality of material, fit, and feel are on a par with more expensive products. The only drawback is the chamois, which is a gel-like center strip with two fiber wing strips. The good news is that it is not bulky and is reasonably comfortable in terms of sit-bone padding and friction. I don't like bulky, heavily padded shorts but, while these are comfortable, they get a little thin on rides over 90 minutes or so (I am on an unpadded, very firm saddle). Therefore, I recommend these for quick rides/spin classes and will wear shorts with better pads on my longer treks. Great for the price and application. Check out the Pearl Izumi Quest for a better pad at just a little more money."
3,Decent,"Not the best of quality, decent for the price I paid. Padding is comfortable and pants fit snugly. Enjoy this!"
3,Ok Product,You get what you pay for. They are fine for short rides but I would recommend paying the extra bucks if you need a good pair.
3,Regular,Le falta un poco más de algodón al producto y me ha respaldado en todos los recorrdiso hechos en largas distancias con la bicicleta
4,Men's bike shorts,"These have a HUGE foam bad sown into the crotch of the shorts. On first appearance I thought would be way too much. However, when I'm riding I don't notice any pressure spots and they are comfortable to ride in. When you're off the bike, it'll feel like to have a mattress between your legs. On the bike, no problem. If you're looking for inexpensive all around padded shorts, these will do fine. I would recommend these to others."
4,great bike shorts,"this bike shorts are great, with plenty of padding to protect you from the seat. I just don't give it a 5 start because they could be a little longer."
5,Great shorts for great price,"I just picked up spinning as a aerobic workout and needed some bike shorts. I was nervous about getting the wrong size since I wear 34"" stuff. I ordered the 32-34 size and cannot be happier! The shorts fit and feel great."
4,Works as specified,These padded shorts are superior to the cheaper shorts that are available. Cheaper shorts had thin cotton padding instead to the thicker foam padding these shorts have. They definite provide cushioning in the right place and there is a noticeable difference in comfort. These shorts were not that much more expensive than the cheaper ones and well worth the price. I threw the cheaper pair away after a single ride as they offerred no improvement at all.
2,Good but not enough,"These bike shorts are pretty good, but they fall a bit short in the padding area. I ride a Jamis Explorer II with a wide saddle seat. After a 10 mile ride, these shorts cushioned the ride significantly less than their more expensive versions. Stretch of the fabric is good, resistance to shrinkage from washing is good, but the ""comfort"" is just a bit less than I want. If your ride is shorter than 30-60 minutes, these shorts will work fine. But, for the longer ride (10+ miles), go for the better padding...it will be worth it."
4,Product is as described,"Shorts came quickly. It is well constructed. Could use a little more padding, but a great value."
3,Good service,"The product arrived as scheduled, it is okay quality wise . but for the price you can't beat it !"
4,bike shorts,I like these shorts because they have padding for the butt and wife likes it because there tight on me.
1,I have not received the said item. Order on Sept 4.,I have not received this item to wear. I ordered it on Sept. 4 and it is Sept 15. My husband and I are leaving to for Colorado to ride bikes in the mountains and he doesn't have his shorts to wear. I rate this company very bad on service.Men's Classic Bike Shorts Cycling Bicycle BikingMen's Classic Bike Shorts Cycling Bicycle Biking
4,Not for the layman.,"This is a concise and well organized manual for the most common types of trauma encountered in a war zone or other similar civilian disaster. It explains in technical, medical jargon the procedures for treating such wounds in a safe and efficient manner.A manual for medical professionals who may need trauma care instructions in the future.I am baffled at the list price of $100 since I picked my copy up at a PX/BX for $19.95 and it is available for free in electronic format at [...]"
5,A timeless Slice of Bliss,"This album was actually first released back in the 80s on audio tape. Through the years it has seen regular use in my Natural Healing Clinic and it sounds as refreshing, meditative, and healing as it did when I bought my first copy. The sounds of the whales are perfectly integrated with Larkin's excellent flute performance. Now that I have finally gotten around to switching everything over to CD I am pleased to find that O'Cean (pronounced O See An) is available on C.D. If you don't have a copy of this album in your healing library, buy one today. You will be glad you did."
4,Erotic Poems,"Life is like a box of chocolates but apparently so is sex. In Chocolate Taste the author, Saphron, puts the box on the table and takes the lid completely off. Without mincing any words, and alliteration and metaphors abounding, the author writes poetry not only for those who enjoy reading it but those who like to talk about it.With poems like Train Ride, Doin' the Dog, Pile Driver, Wake Up Call, and Mussels, Saphron leaves nothing to the imagination, yet it is all in the imagination. You will find some more sensuous pieces but they make less of a statement. Those who like it butt-bare naked raw will be able to appreciate this collection. If you are not afraid of strong sexual language and strong visual imagery, you would want to pick up A Taste of Chocolate.KotanyaAPOOO BookClub"
4,"Brutally, riotously funny","This book is essential for any scholar or passionate reader of SF or, indeed, genre fiction generally. Pair it with the author's novel Herovit's World for a bourbon & gasoline cocktail of black depression for those who genuinely care about the fiction no one takes seriously.Malzberg's chapter on ""instant"" SF novels is both hillarious and sick making: take a plot from the list, buy and guzzle a fifth, make a novel in a weekend, pay the rent. He not only explains the genre writer's life, he does it in front the reader: you can hear the mordant tapping of his dance shoes.A must for any would be writer, along with the essays of Flannery O'Connor."
5,A Great Recital,"This seems to be discontinued but still available through Amazon sellers. It's a great recital, given in Italy in the late 60's with Geoffrey Parsons at the piano. The sound is quite good- better than her early 50s EMI recordings- but watch out for audience applause which can be quite jarring, especially if you're wearing headphones.Schwarzkopf's voice is darker and her singing is more emotive here than her studio lieder recordings, which are now on Great Recordings of the Century. There really is no reason to hesitate buying this, that is unless you do all your music listening with headphones."
1,Innocent Prey,"This question goes for the reviewer above. Before I purchase this book, what is the information not included to make this book a true crime read. What is missing, how can I access true information without necessarily having to talk to the actual characters for whom this book is written after? Where is their website? I am intrigued of this info because of your review. Hope to read from you soon.A true story crime buff"
3,Pretty Good,"This wasn't quite as good as the first Fell book, but it was enjoyable and a quick read. I look forward to other Fell books."
2,unorganized & dated....what else can I say???,"This Almanac has really gone to the dogs. In recent years, This ""Almanac"" has gotten really shoddy since Time took over. When Info Please did the book, it was bearable. I looked in this years edition for the 2000 election result. It was not even in the book. Really updated, is it? Information has always been hard to find and the almamac is disorganized. This almanac has and will never been recomended."
2,Cabinets and Countertops (complete construction),"This book has a huge amount of information but it isn't in a reader friendly format. ""To many words not enough pictures and easy to understand examples"""
3,"Stupid heroine, interesting story.","Book description on back:A LOST COLONY ROMANCE. She was Cidra, an ethereal, fiery-haired beauty, raised amid the serenity and shelter of a spiritual race, but belonging to another people, the so-called Wolves. He was Teague Severance, a ruggedly handsome adventurer, a Wolf used to taking and getting the women he wanted.Side by side on a dangerous quest, they would soar from the shimmering towers of Cidra's home city, to the rough-and-rowdy mining towns of the galaxy's outback, to the lush, deadly jungles of the planet Renaissance. It was their fate to battle both human and alien danger and each other. For Severance would awaken Cidra's untamed and passionate Wolf heritage and the stirrings of a dark, hot desire she had never known before..."
3,Super-natural....,"I do love Jayne Ann Krentz. She is one of my top five best authors, but I think I have gotten a little bored with the sci-fi."
4,Review for Sweet Starfire,I found this very interesting and very different from some of the books I have read. I read different style books and enjoy all of them. I have read for years and still intend to continue to read.
5,Frost in your pocket.......,"I have many original and exhaustive copies of Frost's works but this one is compact, readable and so personal. You won't be sorry you purchased this!"
2,Disappointment,"Having long known of Frost's reputation, but having read only three works, all excellent (The Road Not Taken, Mending Wall, and The Silken Tent), I expected much more from this volume. Unfortunately, Hollander's selections, which eschewed the latter two, by no means showed Frost was a great poet.And with regard to the works that Hollander did select, it was strange to learn that the poet who said ""Writing poetry without rhyme is like playing tennis with the net down"" did cheat so much in blank verse and haphazard rhyme schemes. So until I read a fuller, perhaps better selection of his works, I must ask the question, ""Is Robert Frost overrated""?"
3,Challenging read,"Frost's poetry is very good, there is no denying that, but it must be an acquired taste. I have been reading this volume a little bit at a time but it's not very uplifting and it is hard to enjoy. Melancholia just seems to drip from the pages. I'll bet Robert Frost was a real fun person to be around."
1,Inoperable garbage,"This product does not work. It never sends air to the defrost vents near the windshield. It has a cheap tactile feel and knobs that easily fall off. Do not waste your money, keep your old inoperable stock radio and put a new radio in the compartment near the shifter."
1,Defective,Item was defected and could not be replaced because thy were out of stock. The disappointing part was that it was discovered after waiting 2 hours for installation only to find that the ac/heat controls were defective. The positive was that the refund process was very simple and hassle free
3,"good, over priced!","Product came in on time, only flaw is control knobs don't illuminate to let you how cold or hot , high or low. Material lil cheaply made. But if you Want an after market this is the only way to go."
4,Looks Great!!,This was my first time ever buying a kit and I was skeptical as to how it would look. After installing it with the new stereo it looks like it was meant to be there. The only problem I have with it is that the dials for the temperature and fan pressure don't have lights so you can't tell where the current temperature/pressure is. Otherwise a great product.
3,ok a little overpriced,It seems to work ok the button lights are pretty dim and definately don't feel as good as the regular factory buttons. I guess it will have to do
4,Good but could be better.,I put this in my 2003 Honda Accord.Bad It is a little plain looking and the plastic is a slight diference in color. On hot days the plastic gets a little too pliable.Good This product from what I can tell it the best choice. It looks pretty good for $130 and it does integrate the entire cooling system. I appreciate the produst for the price. Thanks META
4,Great for aftermarket.,While not the most attractive kit for an aftermarket stereo it does function well. I've made sure all the knobs were as they should be based on other reviews and the buttons all light up when pressed and they do work on the first press. Looks aside the unit works well and is very nice to replace a bad stereo in your Honda. I only give it four stars because you can tell it doesn't actually belong but it still looks good. I'd recommend this over the alternative lower din kit any day.
2,"Just Okay, not Great","This kit will fir into dash very well. The look of it does not match with the dash perfectly,but if you want your after market radio to fit in a 2003-05 accord then it will work. The buttons are easy to see and work well. However, the knobs are not well backlit and hard to see at night."
2,Time,My order did not come on time and i'm still waiting for my package to get here. Never had any problems til now with receiving packages.
3,Boring,"I liked the fact that the people in this workout were of different sizes. Is is refreshing to see ""real"" people, however I found this a very boring workout. I don't think I would be able to do it more than once or twice."
2,Shiny piece of crap,"Wrong dimensions, very hard to apply due to over-measured with. Button frame with cut is also wider. Talking about the anti-glare with this thick piece of plastic is just ridiculous. Just avoid this item!"
2,for academics only,"This book is a compendium of information sources for artists. It provides long, categorized lists of websites on a range of topics, including art techniques, individual artists, and even copyright law. It also covers non-Internet resources, such as libraries and museum exhibit catalogs. The Internet resources listed are already becoming dated... a real problem putting this type of information in a printed book. Still, there's some useful information on search methodologies that will work even if sites move and change.The focus of the material presented is very academic. This book will be more useful to a scholarly researcher than a practicing artist or art patron."
5,cat happy,My cats love these socks. The catnip attracts them and the size is perfect for them to carry around.
5,20 year old Craftsman stopping again,"Product does exactly what it was intended to do. Installation was an entirely different story, but with combinations of time, strange tools and lots of patience, it was accomplished in Pop-Pop's garage. Hope it's still available after the next 20 years of use have worn this one out."
5,On security,"Ever since post-cold war the U.S. and other countries have been a little morbid in the use of nuclear weapons; people are afraid by saying the slitest term such as ""nuke"" or ""WMD"" (weapons of mass destruction), that a persons mindset would change to pure evil, cold hearted, and do something drastic. This novel goes in depth about psychological analysis of people and how their minds work, studies have shown how toying around with such language my actually spark a war. This is a great book and awesome for anyone who has a college course on international relations/sociology."
1,Anti-Masonic Deception,"This is NOT a book designed to give information about Masonry. It is an anti-Masonic propaganda sheet - nothing more. As with all such works, facts are replaced by deception offered as if they were fact. To makes things worst, Christianity is represented as if it supports the falsehoods presented. A truly sad work. If you have 3 dollars to waste, buy this book ... or give it to someone standing on a corner asking for food. The latter severs Christianity FAR better."
1,Being A Christian and Being A Mason Don't Contradict,"After reading this pamphlet, I had to laugh. We looked over this in our adult Sunday School class, and, having one of our most devout ministers being a mason, two of my class members being a mason, Mr. Decker has taken an extreme view of this organization. He states that to the Masons, God is a worshiped in a pagen sense. But, like the Boy Scouts, its true the Mason's focus is that God is the Creator. The Masons even add that the Holy Scripture is the one true Word, offering Holy Bibles to their Master Masons. Ask how secretive the Elks are. You can't even get into their building. There is a loyalty, true, and a brotherhood of loving, generous and supportive men focused on helping each other, their neighbors, the community, and the world at large. Don't criticize what you don't understand. I'm not a mason, but I'm considering it strongly. I am a Christian, and it will not be a conflict on my heart or my faith."
5,An Excellent Fact Sheet.,I suggest that all who have loved ones that are in the Masonic Lodge to buy this. This fact sheet will explain what the secret cult of Masonry believes and how unchristian it really is. You can't be both Christian and Mason at the same time. The Mason beliefs are compared to what the Bible teaches. How wide the divide. Buy It!
1,Complete dribble.,The author treats a fraternal organization as a religion. He misses the point completely.
1,The nonsense presented here is absurd.,"I honestly would have enjoyed throwing the money I spent on this fold out pamphlet into a fire, or simply feeding it into a paper shredder. It isn't even worth lining my bird's cage with.As a Freemason, I find this pathetic drivel of the same low caliber as anti Masonic sites on the internet. In fact, there are posters on usenet that copy entire paragraphs from this very pamphlet in authorless posts.Don't waste your money too! The writer doesn't have a clue about the subject he claims to be an expert.I wish the star rating had negative numbers."
1,Not worth the money,This bed topper is way too bg for evena twin bed it is way bigger than it looks in its picture. My son couldnt even sleep in the bed with it on he kept on saying he felt like it was going to fall on him. I tried using it as a play tent but it is really big it took up the play area.
3,Not Quite White,"I'm 85% done with the product and I'm somewhat disappointed. It does work, but it's not as effective as a tray system. It did fade away the yellow, but it didn't make it white. This is likely due to the fact that the gel does not stay in place and gets washed away from saliva, maybe it will work better for people with dry mouth. Overall, it's an average product that shows some result."
2,Disappointing...,"I received a Go Smile treatment while on a Carnival cruise. I then bought the ""maintenance"" product. I found that the use of the product did very little. In fact, I switched to Crest PRO EFFECTS whitestrips and saw a remarkable difference. The Crest strips did more in two days than the Go Smile had in one week. My recommendation is to go with the Crest PRO EFFECTS and skip the Go Smile."
4,Sad events,"I purchased this movie for a different telling of this story. I wanted to see how it compared to the movie ""Mississippi Burning"". What a terrible time this was for our nation."
1,"Nice, until it breaks","I have had this for 2 months, and in a simple action of taking the old paper towel roll off of the stand, I managed to crack the bamboo. The same thing happened to the other bamboo stick that acts as your towel ripper. The quality of this looked fine when I first got it, but it shouldn't have cracked so easily and so soon after purchase."
2,It's ok.,"Not bad. The three feet on the bottom just makes the whole thing unstable and does not help to stabilize the holder. It's ok for the basement or utility room, but if I had to choose again, I wouldn't buy it."
5,Perfect!,"This paper towel holder is perfect for our country kitchen; it's simple, functional, very easy to use, and would look as lovely in 1807 as it does today; we love it!"
5,very nice,very nicely put together and looks nice. love the wood look and ease of loading and unloading the paper towels
2,Bamboo paper towel holder,I ended up returning it because it was poorly made and wobbled. It didn't work out for my purposes so found another.
5,Ideal Gift for Mother for Any Occasion,This worthwhile and well-written book should not be out of print!
5,Get it !,"Two words: Get it. This album is one of the best prog recordings of the year. Forget about Flower Kings new album or The Tangent lastest, this album has it all: Keyboard and synth, amazing vocals by Michael Sadler and Chitron's superb guitar performance. I bought Worlds Apart, Head or Tales, Silent Knight and Saga 1 also, all remastered. Saga's music is timeless, 90% better than what is out there right now."
2,Stale precision,"2 1/2Elderly earnest pop-prog Canadian group can land griping hooks and anthemic moments but are held down, still invested with an 80's power-pop aesthetic which flattens a lot of the already mildly mediocre material. Although Trust sees the group striving to come into somewhat modern times much better then its predecessor, there is just too much commendable practicality and not enough memorable originality."
3,Worthy Effort,"This release is a nice improvement compared to the last 2 studio releases. I rate a least half of the songs above average to very good. There are a couple of songs that are fair at best. The bonus DVD is a joke. With that said, Saga has released a lot of new music in the past 6 years compared to most artists. During this time I feel they have produced some of their best quality music since the early 80's"
3,Saga but only just.,A little lame I'm afraid. A couple of stand out tracks but a bit like they weren't trying too hard. As a Saga fan I had to own it and I am glad I do but don't get too excited about it.Well after listening to this album for aprox 6 months my opinion hasn't changed. Mediocre at best.Mick
4,Insightful,"Difficult read, but I really enjoyed it. Gave good insight into the Muslim people. Had it signed by Reza Aslan when he spoke at my local library. Great guy and very charasmatic speaker. Be sure to see him if he's ever in your area. He also made a great appearance on The Daily Show with John Stewart."
5,Truly Enlightening,"I decided that I had been living in the dark long enough. I wanted to know more about Islam, because ""word of mouth"" seemed to be just plain ignorance. I also suspected that the religion had evolved away from its original intent just as Christianity had. So I saw Reza on ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart"", and I picked up this book.It is a phenomenal eye-opener. It is thoughtful, well-written, and comprehensive. Reza has a unique point of view. He champions women and peace. I think he is the one the entire world should listen to when it comes to matters involving Islam. Read this book--no matter what your religion or ethnicity."
4,good reading,"This book is very specific and complete. If you want to know lot of info about islam religion, This book is for you.Also compares all one god-faith religions as self centered and similar in different approachings."
5,Origins of Islamic faith,"Clearly written, occasionally the details become overwhelming. Best description of development of Islamic faith I have ever read or heard."
3,Marginally Interesting,"I read this book on the strength of other reviews. At 336 pages, it is an extremely terse and somewhat superficial summary of the Muslim religion. I disagree with the reviewer who claimed that Aslan writes so well. He's not bad; but he's not great, either. He makes me wonder if the term ""religious scholar"" isn't an oxymoron.As I read I couldn't help thinking of the hippies who became ""Jesus Freaks"" in the 1960's: Aslan uses infuriatingly vague language to describe transcendent experiences. He strikes me as yet another in a long line of pseudo-intellectuals (like Neale Donald Walsch or Deepak Chopra) who try to reconcile ancient mysticism with contemporary reality."
2,"Very Difficult Read, Did Not Explain Sunni-Shia Antagonism","The reformation of Christianity was a violent argument that engulfed Europe in war for more than a century - even continuing to almost the present in Northern Ireland. Thus, one should not expect Islam to resolve its differences quickly - so says Reza Aslan. On the other hand, with the exception of Northern Ireland, Christianity put this behind it long, long ago.Because of the variability of the Arabic language, wildly different translations of the Quran exist. This problem has been compounded by additions and changes imposed by those with high religious status among his successors. Thus, what Aslan contends were the original views of Muhammed have been substantially ""updated"" - most particularly regarding how women are treated.I was very disappointed by the book's failure to shed light on the intense antagonism now shared between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq."
1,a lie no matter how well spoken is still a lie,"Among the many misconceptions this book paints, none more misleading than describing Medina under Muhammad as some kind of proto-democratic experiment instead of the militaristic dictatorship it really was (if we are going to base our analysis on the Islamic sources themselves).A propaganda piece for the sharia proponents in the West.Reza is still welcomed in Tehran, I wonder why..."
2,Wishfull thinking,"Not in our grandchildren's lifetimes will they see anything remotely resembling enlightened Islam. The author's major problem is that he grew up in America, and understanably, sees the Islamic world and history from that Christianized perspective. The Koran is written in an old fashioned language and script that is not easily accessible to the modern arabic reader. Couple that with the fact that illiteracy rates are very high in many Islamic-dominant countries, except his home country of Iran, and they are at the mercy of the mullahs who preach and teach whatever they interpret as ""holy writ"". With over 240 admonitions to control, convert, or kill the infidel, and only one or two mentions of Love in a Christian sense, it's no wonder the Islamic fundamentalist have won the reformation battle. Game over. Anyone who espouses a modernistic reform agenda will be be rooted out, and struck down. It's dangerous wishful thinking otherwise."
5,excellent introduction to Islam,"This book is beautifully written and deserves to be the bestseller it has become. Aslan is trying to rescue Islam from the traditionalists who see it as stuck in the time of Mohammed forever. Instead, Aslan says the interpretation of what being a ""good Muslim"" is has been hijacked by a series of extremists, and now is the time to reclaim the hidden history of tolerance and diversity. I agree with other reviewers that this has a good chance of becoming the standard book on the subject. Highly recommended!"
2,Ashamed of Islam,"Good writer. Poor exposure of Islam. My overall impression was that the author is ashamed of Islam. He's trying hard (maybe subconsciently) to justify his religion and to make it suitable for an evolved life in the 2000's .It must be painful for an educated, cultured muslim to lower himself to accept and follow(!) such primitive doctrines. Mr. Aslan MUST follow Mohammed's example no matter what school of thought he subscribes to. He does not seem to know precisely what school would that be."
5,A Well Composed Introduction to Islam,"I asked two learned aquaintances who had specialties in Islamic studies for the best one book introduction to Islam I could get, given I knew next to nothing about it...both suggested this book.I found it to be a very insightful read. The first two-thirds of the book, laid a great foundation for my general knowledge on Islam.I am thinking of re-reading it soon."
1,"Spreads lies, dangerous for non-muslims","Lies, lies and more lies. For trueinformation about Islam, see the book:""The Truth About Muhammad"" by Robert Spencer."
3,Thorough and confusing,"I am not sure why I didn't like this book. It just seemed to have so many names about who did what that I couldn't keep all the information straight. It's like reading a novel with way too many characters. I haven't retained much of the information in the book, and am still a little confused about the difference between Sunnis and Shiites. He did make Sufism quite clear though. I think I will have to do more reading on the subject to make the facts stick."
4,An Easy Summary of Islamic Development,"This work is a very readable, comprehensive introduction to the initial development of the Islamic religion by a Muslim source. Albeit a very entertaining book, the work is simply that: an introduction. Whereas it covers details of the life of the Prophet and the development of the Muslim Community in Medina, the book does not delve into later issues of Islamic jurisprudence, nor does it mention the impact of Ottoman rule upon Islam. The Sunni/Shi'a split is also examined to a degree, as are the Pillars, but anyone seeking more than a passing knowledge of the subject should look elsewhere.The author has accomplished his goal in creating a readable, relatively neutral introduction to the Islamic faith. The author is a Shi'a, thus some passages are representative of a slight degree of bias in this respect, but the work as a whole is largely academic."
5,Made a positive difference,"Redid my tower speakers and center channel. I really noticed the improvement in the towers. Music was more defined. I liked it so much, I ordered more! I also used Monster banana clips (see review) and those made connections easier and even made everything sound better. As in cleaner and tighter in response."
5,A difference maker to your home theater system,"I bought this to pair with my LG LHB975 1100-Watt Blu-ray Home Theater System and the sound quality is night and day between the stock wires and the Monster. The stock LG speakers are nothing special and I'm no audio expert, but even to my tinny amateur ears, the improvement was profound. This was a great investment and I'm glad I got it."
2,I hope you can get a 50% discount.,"Only half of this book is about The Dead.The book includes essays analyzing the story from the psychonalytic, reader-response, historical, feminist, and deconstructionist viewpoints.However, these essays are preceded, respectively, by essays on psychonalytic, reader-response, historical, feminist, and deconstructionist criticism in general.If you are interested in literary criticism in general, you might be interested in this book.If you are interested in The Dead, you would do better to look it up in The Social Sciences and Humanities Index."
5,This music IS still available,"Music lovers will want to know: Supraphon has not retired this recording, it has remastered it and reissued it on (SU 3865). The new 2 CD set includes BOTH Brahms Concertos. Both are among the finest performances ever recorded of these works - now with better sound, and at a better bargain than ever."
5,Grear Portable Shortwave Radio,This radio will not disappoint.I purchased several shortwave radios less than $150 in the last year and this is by far the best.Easy to Use.Dial Tuner. This is a feature that no button can replace.Lots of Memory.Sturdy Construction.Single Side Band.Built in Battery Re-charger.Plenty of Sound.After purchasing this radio I regret buying any of the other portable radios that I own.They do not compare.
4,Eton E5 review,"The Eton E5 is the best small portable for FM reception that I've ever seen. It's Broadcast band (AM) is quite good, as well. Shortwave reception is above average but could be improved. When connecting headphones, the FM stereo produced is quite good and the tone of the AM is very satisfactory. A drawback to the radio is the up/down volume control buttons. I find the adjustments to be too coarse. The radio's tuning knob is very good and there's no muting between stations when the knob is tuned. Tone control through the small built-in speaker is quite good for the radio's size. I use rechargeable batteries, and find the battery life to be quite satisfactory. This radio is good value for the money."
3,"Quitcher Slaverin', Angus","There's no need to overdo it. Sure, Jerry Lee has made a song or two now and then that sounded better than the original artist's version; that's the trouble, typical of his albums is the fact that so many of the tunes WERE made by somebody else and often a LOT of somebody else's. Nobody to write an original tune for him, I guess. But he can call ""What Made Milwaukee Famous"" and such his own and if you've never heard the other, usually better, versions, Jerry Lee could usually deliver a good tune so enjoy. Today he shops at Wal-Mart."
4,Works fine!,"Never had any real problems with this Fluval 304 filter. It is quality manufactured (quite heavy duty compared to some Eheim filters) and very quiet. Further it has plenty space for biological, mechanical, and chemical filtration.The only drawback would be that it is quite difficult to open for maintenance, but managable with the right tricks."
3,Eighties Greats,"This book is an informative piece on four of the greatest Major Leaguers of the Seventies and Eighties. Dave Parker ""The Cobra"", member of the great ""WE ARE FAMILY!"" Pittsburgh Pirates and one of the best players not enshrined in Cooperstown. Mike Schmidt, the greatest power hitting third baseman of all time and the backbone of the Philadelphia Phillies for their great teams of the late seventies and early eighties. George Brett, one of the last of the old-time throwback players. The heart and soul of the Kansas City Royals, a member of the illustrious 3000 hit club. Last, but certainly not least, is Mr October himself, Reggie Jackson. Jackson was the biggest star of his time and played up to his billing, a true legend of the game. This book features profiles of all four ball-players, three of them hall-of-famers. Reading this is like taking a time machine back to the Glory of their Times, when each was a Giant in the playing field."
3,"Great Content, Book Format Needs Improvement","The information provided in this book is great. I've never been disappointed with Liz Applegate's books or articles. I do, however, think that a spiral binding would have made this book much more user-friendly. Also, when I looked at the web site that goes along with this book, I realized how much nicer color, quality photos would have been. I ended up printing out the few exercises from the website to use as a quick reference. In hindsite, I wish I investigated the website before I purchased the book."
5,Great exercises for abs!,"Overall, the book is easy to read and the numerous pictures leave no doubt about how to perform each exercise. The six-week plan and diet suggestions will help anyone looking to improve their body, regardless of their current condition. Additionally, I found the exercises for toning and strengthening your abs, and all the muscles in your core, to be particularly useful. I've always had a soft belly, but by using the ball and the recommended exercises, I've seen a noticeable difference. These muscles are notoriously difficult to strengthen with traditional weights and nautilus equipment, but need to be worked because they are so important in nearly every sport. The ball workout is one of the best I've found for working your core. Dr. Applegate provides excellent exercises for the whole body and doing them on the ball forces you to work your core to stay balanced."
2,Half and Half,"I received my TM Ford Oval 2"" billet hitch cover in the mail and was disappointed as soon as I saw it. The blue is a really light blue (did not even come close to the blue on my ford insignia) and didn't match up at all. the quality of the piece (all steel) was good though. I wish the company would have taken the time to get the paint right."
3,Lovecraft did it better,"I'm a Michael Shea fan, but he isnt at his best trying to work in Lovecraft's style. I thought this one was a little cheesy. If you want Shea, get Nifft or Yana; if you want Lovecraft, get Lovecraft. I guess in the Lovecraft-imitation area August Derleth remains the king ... though Stephen King didn't do too bad with that one story."
2,Stay in instead,"2 1/2With oppressively pseudo-sexy vocal delivery careening upon old-man-dom, guided by stale interplay and techno-sheened, early nineties alternative production, only an apparent centerpiece ""Sometimes"" remains virtually unscathed from aesthetics."
5,Extraordinary,"World Outside is a great record. I saw the band perform this live in Portland, Oregon and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen. The album was produced by Steven Street (who produced the Smiths, Morrisey, and others) and that probably accounts for its' excellent sound. The cover art was a collaboration between Richard Butler and Vaughn Oliver of 23e/4AD fame. Altogether, a real creative milestone that seemed to be overlooked by many. If you can find the video for ""Until She Comes"" check it out. It's brilliant."
3,"Lacy Great As Usual, Rudd Not So Hot","Never is heard a discouraging word about trombonist Roswell Rudd, but listening to him lag behind the beat, create sound effects, and project a maybe-I'm-here-maybe-I'm-not affect just makes me tired. The CD picks up energy in the second half, as if the tracks were recorded in order and Rudd finally gets going. Oddly, the vocal tracks are the best, even though Aebi dubbed her voice in later rather than recording live with the band. What you want, instead of this CD, is ""The Beat Suite"" by Lacy with trombonist George Lewis, who astonishes with his facility and ideas."
4,"A great trio: Lacy, Rudd, and Monk","A good recording. Contains many of the songs recorded on ""The Rent"" with the Steve Lacy Trio. The trombone/soprano sax combination makes for an interesting sound. The choice of material is good with catchy melodies and plenty of room for improvising. Irene Adei sings on two songs - her style is more opera than Ella and it can be a shock when her voice jumps out of the speakers for the first time (about 20 minutes into the CD). A very enjoyable recording that holds up on repeated listenings."
5,New Land by Rubaja,"This album is a vintage mix of Spanish and native South American rhythm; an enjoyable ambiance which might appeal to fans of Medwyn Goodall, Cusco or Alice Gomez."
1,too short,"These racks are not 24 inches as advertised. They are only 22 inches. If you are replacing 24 inch racks, these are not the ones to do it with."
4,You Can Say,"You Can Say is a classic slice of Krezip's unique blend of rock pop. A catchy guitar based tune to mosh out in your room to, this is a must for hardcore Krezip-ers (like myself) and also any music fan!"
4,Lovely POpera,Beautiful opera. Enjoy the music. Renee Fleming is a personal family friend.I believe this one is the best version of this opera.
2,Old style opera! In the bad sense.,"Well, this is a good oportunity to watch and listen Fleming, Villazón, Bruson and Conlon together. But the mise en scene by Mrs. Placido Domingo is so bad. Looks like a poor old style in a little town! And Fleming, one of my favorites sopranos, is not Violetta."
2,I saw this live,and it was not remotely close to being a great Traviata. Fleming did not project well; Villazon seemed stiff and nervous; Conlon is clearly not an accomplished Verdian conductor; the sets were average at best.Too many USA people just give any Fleming performance an inflated rating because she is attractive and is from the USA.
1,Look elsewhere,I bought this book to accompany the others in the series and this has disappointed time and again. The information that's in here is covered in much better detail in Litwin/Getz/Gunderloy's Access 2002 Developer book by the same publisher. One subject it covers well is creating forms dynamically. So it gets a star. I blame the editors for letting this go to print.
3,Not for the hands on learner,I am in chapter 3 and have decided to set the book aside and look for a more hands on approach. It's my learning style. I learn a lot more from a technical book (on a new topic) where you work through more examples. Once I have gone through a book with more examples I suspect that the theoretical approach will be more meaningful. I will come back to read this book at a later time.
2,warning,"I suffer from DLP rainbow effect so had to go with an LCD unit. Colors are not as vivid and with the lower contrast ratio video images are not as good as DLP models.""Screendoor effect"" is extremely noticable especially in white/bright areas of video.don't be fooled by the advertisment that this accepts component video signal (which gives you the best possible image).I purchased a vesa adapter to connect via component video to the monitor connection on the unit. it didn't work. after some research, I found that you can only use Epson's adapter to make it work which runs $100. Now, am I going to get $100 worth of image gain over s-video? i don't think so.do not buy this if you want to connect via component video. i read that Epson is the only company that doesn't use the standard adapter.I also received a brand new unit with a dead pixel, which i read is pretty common for LCD projectors over time but i didn't expect it fresh out of the box that way."
4,Kentucky v Georgetown 1984,I am a UK fan.Not as big as some but I wanted to have this game because I went to school with one of the Kentucky players in high school.I very much enjoyed this purchase because I just like being able to go back and watch this game from time to time.If you are an Kentucky fan you'll enjoy this
2,Dissapointed.,The image quality leaves something to be desired. It's a novelty. If you want to display sharp crisp prints: print the picture out and display in a nice frame. The software is cumbersome and not what you would expect with today's one-click gagets.
4,Very Nice Paper,"Appears to be of great quality. Thick. Printed with ""hp"" words on the back for a ""professional"" look. Very glossy, prints well."
2,READ BEFORE PURCHASING!,"If your computer is the only medium to listen to this CD, then DON'T BUY IT!! It is cloaked with an advertisement by Elektra Entertainment Group that asks if you want more information about other music and the cloak will not allow you to get past that window to listen to the music. The cloak leads to their site! The CD plays fine in my car and it's a great CD. But because I am usually at my computer I can't even listen to this most of the time. Very poor taste for a company to do something like this to customers! I personally will never buy an Elektra label again. And I have learned to check the reviews because someone else had the same problem. I wish I knew how they resolved it. I wonder if the artist had known the company was going to do this to their CD that they might have preferred to signed up with another music label!I hope this review helps other people BEFORE they buy and get burned like I did!"
3,Love the music but was cloaked,"It was a gift to my wife, we are both fans. We love the songs alot. But the main listening station for us is our PC, and this CD was cloaked. If you want to see an unhappy woman, that was my wife on her birthday receiving her favorite artist's CD and couldn't play it on her computer. Now we have resolved it, and really like this CD. The 3 stars are for the playability. The music gets a 5."
5,My favorite Natalie Merchant solo effort,"This album starts with a WOW and goes from there. This House is on Fire is an amazing song with loads of energy. I also love the next 2 tracks and generally really enjoy everything on the CD except Henry Darger. What sets this CD aside from NM's earlier solo albums is the range of musical styles. There's ""typical Natalie"" but then there's also an assortment of influences from various areas of the world. Yet NM incorporates these sounds without coming across as some pretentious artiste thinking they're being hip by getting into world music. Wonderful."
5,Natalie with a twist (but with the same amazing lyrics),"Natalie Merchant is one of the rare artists who continually improves with each new CD. She keeps getting better and better. ""Motherland"" excels by incorporating diverse musical genres that takes the listener through a memorable journey with each listen. There are many songs that I really like so it would be unfair to highlight a few. But if you think you might enjoy Natalie with a twist (but with the same amazing lyrics), then I would suggest that you pick up this CD. I previously thought that Ophelia would be her masterpiece but Motherland surpassed all my expectations."
1,"more of the same, only not as good","10,000 Maniacs is one of my favorite groups of all time. When Natalie Merchant left the group, I was skeptical about either's ability to continue creating good music. I've been proven wrong in most cases -- Tigerlilly and Ophelia were both strong records. More than the sound of any particular song or the instrumentation or the vocals, the thing that ties all of the music together (and the thing that makes it good), is that it is interesting. There's a cool riff, or a cool groove, or something, in each and every one of the songs on each and every one of the albums. Motherland is another story. It's just too slow, too down, too long to earn much airtime on my cd player."
1,The voice of an angel disappears...,"Having been a fan of Natalie since 10,000 maniacs, I feel compelled to say that we (my husband and I) did not enjoy the Motherland track.Granted, Ophelia and Tigerlily are a tough act to follow but Motherland lacks substance. With Tigerlily and Ophelia, you kick your shoes off, close your eyes, and relax instantly. With Motherland, you are painfully aware of the music.... Natalie deepens her voice in this CD -- so much so that you can't relax. Our first thought was ""What is she doing here?"" What's her point?Sure, Nat's evolving as musician, but I always felt she never needed to compete....I'd pass on this one."
1,"Bad, sad, mad","Every artist makes a bad CD and this is hers.As a huge fan of all of Natalie's work I need to tell you this self indulgent album is very bad!Her past work has always had an optomistic social critic of the world as she sees it.This album instead displays a mood of pathetic and depressing self loathing, with none of the thought or concerns for the world around her.I CANNOT belief family, friends, and the record company didn't say, ""Stop!, go back when you are in a better mood.""I actually threw the CD away. It was so bad I wouldn't even sell it to someone else!"
2,Can't quite put my finger on what's wrong,"Admittedly, my favorite Merchant CD was Tigerlily, and I think she keeps going downhill. My first impressions were that the songs were weak and not very listenable. Even worse, it sounds like Natalie was trying to sing every song with a mouthful of marbles. I may end up giving this one up to a friend."
4,Natalie's Back!,"...and we've been waiting for years!! Not as accessible as her other albums, this is nonetheless a great cd. Listen to it a few times and you'll quickly start humming along. Not as good as 'Ophelia' - my all time favourite cd - 'Motherland' nonetheless contains some great songs; 'Golden Boy' comes to mind, and also 'Henry Darger' which almost reminds one of Nick Cave and 'Murder Ballads'.A great album - but, admitted, I'm a sucker for anything featuring Natalie."
5,Natalie continues to produce excellent music!,"Where in the (...) Natalie can go? Definately to the top of the triple AAA charts with Motherland. She has grown so maturely as an artist and Motherland is the album where Natalie has deepened her voice for such songs as ""This House is On Fire"" and ""St. Judas"". Guest singer Mavis Staples harmonizes Natalie's voice so well. Triple A singles such as ""Just Can't Last"" and ""Tell Yourself"" might bring in new fans of Natalie, but from devoted fans of hers, the rest of the album is like candy to our ears. She so totally rocks and I encourage everybody who is into folk/blues, and her previous releases to buy ""Motherland"". A terrific album all around."
4,Unique & mesmerizing album,"Natalie Merchant is one of the most unique voices in contemporary music today. ""Motherland"" is a mesmerizing album. Merchant is like a torch singer entrenched in the singer-songwriter-folk tradition of the late 1960s. The lyrics are shot full of politics - the politics of love, addiction, and oppression - and her vocal stylings add layers of subtle texture to the meanings and nuances in the words. With ""Motherland,"" Merchant loses all traces of ever having been in a band with 10,000 Maniacs... and, suprisingly, that's not a bad thing at all."
5,"Sublte, surprisingly good","Motherland is intimate, daring, and most of all, soulful. Natalie Merchant's voice sounds deeper and significantly more mature here than any of her other albums. While there is no real radio-friendly tunes, all the tracks work together extremely well. What is surprising is that Natalie has reinvented herself here with a sound that is slow, yet full of rythum. You could put it into your CD player and just start slow-groovin to it. It's a great CD!"
4,Beautiful voice,"Natalie has a wonderful throaty voice which carries a song farther than one could imagine. If you like to listen to the voice of a woman and not a teenager, pick Natalie Merchant!"
3,her beautiful voice is almost enough to save this album,"I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed with this album. As a long time merchant and maniacs fan, I'll always buy her albums when they come out, but this album isn't as all-around listenable as her previous solo efforts. It's much more folky, with a wide variety of different instruments used on the tracks. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing; the title track and 'tell yourself' are two of my favorite all-time songs of hers. But I miss the more piano-laden tracks from ophelia and some of the maniacs albums. I think the more complicated musical score actually detracts from her music. I just want to hear her voice, with as little extra complications as possible. While it's still a decent album, I'd definitely recommend ophelia or her live album before buying this one."
3,"5 stars for the music, no stars for the recording quality","Natalie writes songs and sings them like nobody else, and in this album she even beats her old self. What is extremely annoying though is the quality of the CD. After taking more than three years to come with this wonderful album, it beats me how such a top class artist allows its deliverence in such a lousy way."
5,Natalie does it again,"As a longtime Merchant and 10,000 Maniacs fan, I was excited to see this new release. The lyrics are strong, unapologetic, and beautiful. She is using a deeper voice on this CD, and it sounds mature and almost bluesy at times. Ms. Merchant is a creative powerhouse, and is in no danger of becoming stagnant. Intelligent and stimulating, and purely entertaining. What more could you want?"
2,"A Terrible, Self-Indulgent Bore","I have been a fan of Natalie since 1988. Her intelligent, quirky lyrics and delivery were consistently spellbinding. Her solo efforts have been spotty at best, while still yielding the occasional gems like ""Ophelia,"" and ""7 Years."" This album, however, seems to have been written and recorded in about an hour. The observations are pat, the lyrics paint-by-numbers, and the music? It all sounds like one big long bad song. Natalie would do well to collaborate musically. Think of all the interesting and engaging covers she does live! The reason they are interesting is that they were written by someone with different sensibilities. ""Build A Levee?"" C'mon. Even Mavis Staples can't save that one. Save your money and give ""In My Tribe"" and ""Natalie Live"" another listen."
4,Her best solo-album.,"I like Natalie's music very much (actually I prefer her music as a solo singer) and this production is very good, all the songs have nice lyrics and this woman's voice is delightful.The first single ""Just can't last"" is her best song ever.10,000 maniacs is a good gruop but Natalie your music is better when you're on your own."
2,Worst Natalie Merchant Album,This CD has my favorite Natalie Merchant song (motherland) on it. Other than that there are 1 or 2 others worth listening to (build a levee). Don't buy this disk. I love Natalie Merchants stuff but this one is worth skipping.
3,book review,"The seller indicated this old, used book was in very good condition. Service was good and quick but the book was in fair condition at best. The seller was notified and promptly offered to discount the price to my satisfaction. Thus, I am much happier."
5,A favorite.,"My whole family loved this book when I was growing up.As a kid, every time you turn the page your eyes get wide and you grin when you see what is happening. It's exciting.The pictures are fantastic.If you're thinking of buying this, it's definitely worth finding a copy."
2,"Great wake up motivator, but the ideas are slowing down","Don't get me wrong. I've been a past admirer of Peters and his delivery technique as a harsh but incisive corporate coach. But the ideas are slowing down, and although you may be dazzled with the puzzling and busy page layouts of the book, drill down further and you realize perhaps Peters has done his best, but ideas aren't as forthcoming as his younger and more active years. This is no crime, but I suspect his reputation now precedes his content. I much prefer the ""The Art of Happiness at Work"" by HH Dalai Lama, or the new Asia book ""Dot ZEN"" by a tag team of new authors in the Far East. Quirky but refreshing with lots of real stories out of the East."
3,Interesting but hard on the arm muscles,"This is a wild collection of Tom Peters thoughts culled from his portfolio of Powerpoint slides.I particularly liked the Chapter on Education - both the current workforce & the future workforce.For all the boasting he made about his new partnership with Dorling Kindersley, I found the book too heavy, and the key ""Contrast"" Summary tables at the end of each Chapter were printed White feint on a bright Red background - very hard to read - DK should know better."
1,Annoying,I downloaded a copy of this book from Itunes for my ipod. He was hard to understand. I don't think we need to know all about History. A little background information would have been enough. It was repetitive. He was abrasive and annoying. I did agree with who marketers are ignoring but these marketers aren't listening. Mainly this just kind of repeats what he has done in the past.
1,More of a Comic Book,I couldn't read beyond first chapter of this book. The colors and graphics gave me headache. Presentation of the book is very complex and confounding. The author doesn't talk anything new in this book. Its all up in the air!
2,Not much new under the sun,"This book is pretty standard. The design is awful and will give one a headache just attempting to keep up with the graphics and sidebars. I'm a Tom Peters fan, but this book was a disappointment. He states the obvious, retreads old stuff, and makes no compelling case, other that his ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore"" attitude (which is admirable to a point). Glad I bought this at a deeply discounted price, for I would have returned if purchased for full retail. Not his best work by a long shot."
1,pointless tripe,"I have a business background so someone thought I'd enjoy a ""business"" book as a Christmas gift. Bad idea! I've read plenty of books in this genre and this seems to cut and paste from all of them. I thought this guy was supposed to be some kind of business guru but, from what I managed to make myself read, he is struggling for new ideas. And unless you're an rabid man-hater I'd stay away from Ch. 21 altogether, sexism disguised as progressive thought.Lots of better books out there if you want to get some idea of upcoming economic trends, just browse any well-stocked business section at a local bookstore. As for this one I managed to convince the store clerk to let me exchange it for something a little more interesting."
1,The internet didn&#65533;t change the Honor Code,"The reviewer who said it was OK to freely borrow from ""Free Agent Nation"" should be aware that in my view this would be a violation of our Honor Code and would probably get me kicked out of my MBA program. The internet didn't change the Honor Code.Perhaps this book wasn't geared to MBA programs. Even so, trying to repackage to appeal to a younger audience without upgrading the content is a mistake. The reviewer below underestimates people's sense of right and wrong as well as attention spans. Mr. Peters underestimates people's ability to discriminate between form and substance."
4,Wanna be Competitive- Reimagine Every thing,"I was introduced to Tom Peters when I was in College (10 years back). I first read his book ""Seminar"". Thereafter I have never missed any of his books. These books have been very instrumental in my career.Actually Tom Peters is just an observer, he observes & tell what has gone right & what has not with reasons. His books are not a management theory (unlike Drucker), he just gives you some food for thoughts. My recommendation is that if you are reading his book, don't read it more that 4-5 pages at a time then stop-take notes-think about-how you can use it in your prospective.The book ""RE-IMAGINE"" is complete TOM PETERS Encyclopedia. It has some new things & some old writing from his books Pursuit of Wow, The Project 50, The Brand You 50, The Professional Service Firm50, The Circle of Innovation. If I were to name this book I would have named it as Best of Tom Peters."
1,False Advertising,"These ideas aren't new for the market, and they aren't even new for Tom Peters. They are a repeat of what he's been saying for ten years. This design is touted as good, but it is fluff over substance. The book runs around chasing its own tail. The design is distracting and bad.While the title is re-imagine the theme is regurgitation of old ideas in inferior packaging."
1,"Good Coffee Deserves a Good Book, Not This One",I agree with the reviewer that said there is nothing here that hasn't already been better presented in the Wall Street Journal or Financial Times general business interest pages. This book is scatty and the layout doesn't help communication.
4,Tom Peters scores again,"I'm a fan of Mr. Peters and have been since reading ""In search of excellence"" and viewing ""A Passion for the Customer"". His fertile mind is constantly taking things that seem out of reach and letting us reach them through the use of the obvious. Re-imagine is another stop along the way as Peters lifts himself up among the guru's of American management."
5,Great Book,Tom Peters has an amazing mind and always a fresh point of view. I highly reccomend this book! Amazon got it to me in flawless shape as well.
3,Meet Tom at the Bar for best results,"Tom Peters blasts into his book Re-Imagine with gusto, touting the power of pissed off people like him to change the world! However, in spewing forth his rhetoric and ideas, the medium of prose does not seem quite sufficient in bandwidth, so the book has side bars, parenthetical remarks, and jumps topics mid-sentence. For best results, bring a glass of wine to your reading chair, and don't try to drink in every word, just listen to the jist of it. You're meeting Tom Peters at the bar, so it's best to be on the same grounds as him."
1,Re-call!,"It seems people either love or hate this book. I fall into the former category. This material is very old and hasn't incorporated latest studies. It is the same material as in Tom Peter's other books, and what little is new, isn't insightful. ""The internet changes everything."" Not worth the read. The layout may be original, but it is a bad idea. Tom, it's time for a Re-think!"
4,Good golden nuggets to extract,I feel this is a good read. Provides some very good insight. Some very good golden nuggets to take from. Inspiring. I recommend.
5,Very Refreshing and Insightful,This is the best business book I have ever read. The writing and style of the book is very non-traditional compared to other books in this category which is refreshing and engaging all at once. Re-imagine! appealed to both my engineering and business background and has made me rethink the way I look at things and will definitely influence the way I run my company and projects in the future. Relevant information for our time and a must read for anyone desiring a fresh perspective.
2,"Good content, strange format","I decided to buy the book after hearing an audio version of the title. I thought the opinions and ideas presented were very interesting and inspiring. It stresses the essence of constant changing when we cope with today's business world and society. It also puts emphasis on people: workers, consumers, etc., and value their role in all business activities. I considered this book especially valuable for young people as they start their careers.But the book itself is disappointing in its format. It is very fragmented and looks like a cartoon. Instead of a main text area, the pages are divided into various boxes and shades. It is difficult to read the book coherently and also difficult to take the book seriously.fragmented and looks like a cartoon."
4,"Good, but with reservations...","I finished Tom Peter's latest book last night... Re-imagine! I'm a Tom Peters fan, as I like his attitude and style of writing. Having said that, this one was more difficult to read than his previous titles...He switched publishers, and went with a more creative style. The pages are colorful with numerous images and side notes. As I found myself struggling to get through the book, I wondered if perhaps that was the reason. Too much visual distraction... The content is typical Peters... The day of the corporate slave is over, you are the CEO of Me, Inc., you should be working on WOW! projects, really good products/services are not enough any more, it's the WOW! experience that separates you from the pack...An OK book for some new ideas and outlooks on corporate life. Not quite a ""sit down and read it"" type book."
1,Disappointment,"Unlike the reviewer who re-shelved this book twice, I bought this book on faith. Now I want to return it and get my money back."
3,Book review,This book was purchased for my grand child's college course. I will know more as she progresses through the class.
5,THE GREATEST ALBUM - EVER...,"This album is SOOO good. It's including the greatest hits by Army of Lovers and a ""Le Remixed Docu-Soap"" - CD (the 10 best remixes), but not just that, on the album you can find the brand new single ""Hands Up"" and one unreleast track: ""Everybody's Gonna Lurn Sometime""... What I think is the best of the copy that I have is that it's signed. And that's just luck - the 3 august I where in Stckholm and meat the four guys! But that's just mine album. But still, it's worth the money... It's like this; the worst track on the album - ""Candyman Messiah"" - is still good, you can't get an 'all-good-tack' album anymore (but this one is)! So go and get it, if not - you will regrept it for ALL your life! So what are you wayting for, when a '28-track-2CD-album' is wayting for you!?! J."
3,Not the best of Ms. Green.,"Having recently finished reading the Terrilian series (which was riveting), I was disappointed with this book. Perhaps if I had read it first, I wouldn't feel this way. Of course, it is a lighter romantic fantasy, but just not what I had come to expect from Ms. Green. I had trouble finishing the book."
4,Four Paws Easy Feeder Syringes,"I like these syringes for assist feedings, and so far, they hold up really well. I've only been using them for a little over a month now, so we'll see. My only complaint is that I have to buy both types (two types per package) in order to get the one that works best for me."
2,They started to bind within two months,"I bought these to dose an aquarium with fertilizer and fill small test tubes. They didn't work out, though. After less than two months they started to become rough and eventually bind. I realize that my application isn't conventional, but I think the issues I had also apply to their intended use.The good:-The markings have held up well, though they are starting to fade. Putting packing tape over the cylinder might be a good way to preserve them, but I haven't tried it.-Fairly high capacity.-The tapered tips lets you tailor them to a certain use.The bad:-Although they started out smooth, that didn't last long. In my case their useful life was only two months while being used every one or two days.-The plungers lock when depressed all the way, which makes extracting something difficult because you have to pop it loose. I don't understand why their designed that way, but if someone knows of a reason for it, then feel free to post a comment."
4,Damn.,"I'm not sure I can say enough good things about this record. This record is so good, you'll slap your grandmother upon first listen. Southern soul rarely if ever sounded so, so good. Simultaniously smooth and raw, ""Lonely"" has an immediacy that hits you where you live and then sticks around for a little while, taking up space on your sofa. Fix some sweet tea, and do it fast. It's fixin' to get hot in here."
4,Good book for hikes in the park,"Does a really excellent job of giving information about hikes in the park, including categorizing them according to such criteria as ""good for first time trips"" and ""hikes for a foggy day: to escape the fog and to revel in the fog."" Also does include a few hikes in the surrounding state parks.On the downside, description of hiking and other outdoors activity is the only topic in the book, and there's no mention of places to stay, the little towns in the area, restaurants, et c. While obviously that info goes out of date faster than description of hiking trails, it would still be nice to have at least a brief mention of the towns and a list of restaurants and lodgings."
2,Disappointed,"I usually love House Beautiful books, but this one did nothing for me. Typically, the photos are beautiful, as the name indicates, but not in this case. They were boring. The book did not show a wide range of artistic styles or medium, nor did it give a wide range of ideas for displaying ones art. You can find just as many ideas for displaying your art in a ""general"" interior design book. I recommend you skip this book or check it out from the library."
4,For anyone who loves art and loves decorating,"I love art and I love decorating--and this book is a wonderful combination of the two. I believe that art--whether paintings or murals, or sculptures or carvings--are key components of a beautiful home, and this book shows inspiring examples of others who believe the same. The decor and art collections shown might not be to everyone's taste, but this book shows the possibilities of what can be done to create a tasteful and aesthetic living space."
1,"useless, not worth $1","The 'maps' are large (slightly fuzzy) color pictures of sky with plastic overlays showing constellations and a few objects of interest, but... only a few. Large pages feature five thumbnail sized pictures of deep sky objects per sector, with unhelpful blurbs like 'requires a 400mm telescope to see.' Not even minimal information like coordinates and magnitudes.Not useful with a large scope (no coordinates or fine detail to find even the few objects mentioned), not useful for small scopes (most of the objects mentioned are too faint), and not useful without a scope with such tiny pictures."
3,Just Okay,"The series is not bad but certainly not good either. I fully agree with others that there is more action in this series compared to the other Marvel anime that I have seen(ie. X-Men), the animation is quite nice, character development is there but the story gets slow in some points. The writers brought in elements of Blade's sword training from his past but also wrote in some mysticism with three sword techniques...LOL!I don't regret watching this series (certainly not worth a 5 rating) but this feels more like a rental."
2,Travesty,"Trying to shoehorn an established and gritty Marvel character like Blade into the conventional tropes of Japanese manga is just plain dumb. Water tiger vampires? Sword strokes with dramatic names blazoned in Kanji on the screen? Are you freaking kidding me? This has nothing to do with Marvel's Blade. This is the illegitimate child of Vampire Hunter D and Cowboy Bebop meets the Power Rangers. If you're into the original stone-cold, combat hardened, non-magical Blade, stay away from this hot mess.P.S. If you're going to repackage a Marvel character as Japanese anime, put ""Anime"" on the case, don't call it an animated series."
5,Humor and political insight unparalleled,"Berke Breathed was one of those rare political cartoonists whose political insight was the same weight as his humor. ""Bloom County"" was his greatest vehicle. Some other cartoons have great political scope but just don't make you laugh out loud--""Doonesbury"" and ""Mallard Fillmore"", particularly. While others fake political insight, but are very humorous. ""Tales Too Ticklish to Tell: Bloom County"" is as good as any of the other Bloom County anthologies, but it's the inclusion of a Bloom Picayune that makes this an extra treat, and serves as a reminder that this strip was special for its time. Boy, do I miss it."
2,I quit,I don't know I just lost interest and quit 3/4 of the way through. After awhile I just didn't care about any of the characters. Nothing like Silver Lining.
5,Actress/Director sees the light!,"This is my first review of anything, but I felt like I needed to give this book a plug--even though it comes from a small, independant press, this book should be in every acting/directing/theater class in the nation. Cady and Stevenson take you through the inner workings of the agent business, the right/wrong approaches to auditions, the way to work in Hollywood while keeping your sanity, all while maintaining an easy tone that gives one the confidence to take a chance and try to be a star! Great work, and a bargain for those of us who thought they knew the business."
5,nicole wray electric blue,just heard a few tracks off the nicole wray album and think the album is hot.if anyone has it as i really wood like to have it email me twocans11@hotmail.com
5,Nicole is the best,"I'm from Germany and nearly nobody knows Nicole here. Well, I hope in America People do, cuz she's such a great artist. Her Voice is so strong and emotional and she's such a beautiful Girl!!!! It's such a shame that she doesn't get the promotion she should get. If she got, she would be so succesful!! Belive me, this CD is off tha chain!! Buy it, and you'll know what I'm talkin 'bout.EVERYBODY who likes great R'n'B, Soul or HipHop Music will love this Album more than anything else on this World! Peace"
2,Bad Quality Video,"I have two Fleischer Superman DVDs. I have this one and I also have one I picked up in Japan. The Japanese one (which only features half of the cartoons) is far superior to this one. The prints in these dvds, so far, appears to have been blown up from other videos that were much smaller in resolution. Sorry, but I think better quality video exists somewhere else."
3,Classical,This is a good cd. The blend of the horn and the piano is heavily weighted on the horn. I would have preferred a more equal blend
2,extremely overrated,"For reasons that I do not understand, Wynton is considered a player of the highest caliber. While his technique would have to seem impressive to most of his fans, in comparison to players such as Phil Smith, Charlie Schleuter, Matthias Hofs, and many other top symphony players, Wynton is completely out of his league. Wynton's interpretations of some of these pieces are laughable in their complete lacking of any sense of direction. Compare his recordings of the Enesco and Hindemith with ones put out by Phil Smith and Charlie Schleuter,amd it is like listening to a student play a piece for his teacher, and then the teacher playing it the way it ought to go. The only valid reason to buy this recording is the great programming. It's just a shame that it is not another trumpet player playing the same pieces."
2,Title doesn't make a lick of sense!,"Movies in this book are not obscure, by any means. How can a book about films that are smaller and less known include ""Groundhog Day"", ""Vertigo"", and ""Zoolander"" ?!?! Just Crazy!!!"
5,"More Mysteries, Please","I wasn't persuaded by ""The Existence of God."" Its argument for theism is meticulous but it depends on heroic assumptions about the ""simplicity"" of God, the kind of world He would make if He existed, what the world would not be like if He did not exist, how free will and suffering midwife human moral improvement, and much more. To me, these are imponderables, the stuff of yearnings and poetry -- yet Swinburne dresses up his argument in the notation of confirmation theory! The details are brilliant, but the whole system is hard to buy.That said, the Amazon reviewers who gave ""The Existence of God"" one- or two-star ratings are being unfair. The book represents bold philosophical speculation at its finest -- the writing is clear, the argument is ingenious and rigorous, the issues are profound, and the conclusions are appropriately modest. Anyone interested in philosophy of religion has to read this book."
3,Sweet read,Minnie Pearl was a sweet woman and the book is a nice tribute to her. There were times I teared up. I would say if you just need a quick read about a sweet woman who knew and met so many of country music's greats this would be a good book to read on a rainy day. Don't look for in depth knowledge of Minnie or of anyone else. It's surface stuff all the way.
2,Minnie Pearl autobiography,A wonderful story! A very enjoyable read whether or not you are a fan of hers or of country music.
1,Crap,"This is the most frustrating program I ever buy, the technical support is a waist of time they send me to a web page advancetech and never find an answer for my question I have the program for about 9 Days and I can`t figure out how to make a check I can only get blank checks I can not fill the information that I want to put, like amount payee and to who so I`m going to remove it from my computer and return it to the store and buy Versacheck 2008 to see if that one is better than this crap. So any one to want to be frustrated with this program feel free to buy it"
1,Checksoft by Avanquest SUCKS!,I have attempted to install and use this program numerous times and have spoke with the company for technical advice all to no avail... a total waste of fifty dollars. Would not recommend this to anyone!
1,MrFelix,"Easy to use, could do all the items I needed to. However this was my second upgrade, and some of my data base and lables didnt transfer from the old version to the new, which ment hrs of re-designing. parts of the new program didnt load and THEN IT HAPPEND ! WHEN TRYING TO OPEN THE PROGRAM IT LOCKED UP MY WHOLE COMPUTER. After getting my computer up and running I contacted their customer service dept, short of disasembaling my computer and hrs of install, remove, reboot and everything else the common user doesent know or want to deal with, they just stoped responding to my e mails. Iffy."
3,Acceptable,"Was very insightful, seemed a little outdated, to deal with my situation I leaned more toward the advise from ""Divorce Poison"" but this book does assist with laying the ground work for children in these situations."
3,"Cute and a good value, but damaged","This is an adorable chair and the choice of colors is wonderful (the Blue is fantastic). It's simple to put together and sturdy. My only problem was that it came with the paint scratched off on one side, at the top, and on a bottom runner. The damage clearly did not happen in transit, since it was securely wrapped and packaged. We really like the chair, will keep it and I can touch up the paint myself, but I shouldn't have to. Otherwise, this is a nice, high quality little rocker. KidKraft items are great!"
4,"Great rocker, there is no slat though underneatht he seat though","Great rocker, it is a little high, I guess it would be good for a 2 year old, my son is 18 months. In the picture there is a slat on the bottom on all 4 sides, but there is one on the rocker, so when my son gets on it he has nothing there to push his litle booty further on the seat, but it is SUPERB quality. This is REAL SOLID wood. It will last a lifetime"
2,I knew it would be cheap but not this cheap,Chair came very scratched. Half of the chair was not even painted Espresso like the rest. I know it was not a lot of money but I expected a bit more.
1,Wood is cracked!,"We bought this rocker back in May and intended on giving it to our daughter for her 2nd birthday in June. However, she was in a climbing stage so we decided to wait until Christmas. The box remained under our bed until today, Christmas Eve, when my hubby opened the box to put it together there was a big crack on the seat."
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered this rocking chair for my granddaughter. When I received it, the arm was scratched and there was a gouge in on of the back rungs. In addition, there were mars in the paint, and the wood had several rough spots. Definitely poor quality of materials and construction. When I contacted the seller to return it, I was told I had to pay for the cost of the shipping and a 30% of the sale price as a restocking fee. This is a scam to consumers. Do not buy this product."
4,Rocking chair of good quality,"Hard to rate this item yet. This chair was purchased for our granddaughter of 22 months. She loves it and rocks her babies while sitting. She is tall for her age, and still cannot touch the floor with her feet to rock efficiently, if she is all the way seated. It looks durable, but only time will tell.The look is good. The surprise, and perhaps I didn't read all the information since it was recommended to us by our kids, it had to be assembled."
5,The BEST wipes ever put on the market by Amazon or anyone else.,These wipes do everything they claim to do. To be able to rinse and reuse each wipe 20 times is quite remarkeable and indeed makes them a reusable and money saving cloth!
4,"Intro to cell culturing, staining technique, interpretaion","This is a book of cytogenetics. (I'm a nonbio major.)The author seems a person who supervises lab tests for hospitals.Excellent detailed diagrams explaining mitosis and meiosis.Looking at chromosomes thru an optical microscope with stains.Looking at the chromosome bands and interpreting them as genetic defects,both congenital and acquired (cancerous).Cell culturing and staining techniques.Has simplified catalogs of irregularitiesincluding one entry on retinoblastoma.The resolution of staining technology is about 4 megabases.Introduction to some specialized higher resolution techniques.Reading this book awakens us to the coming science-fiction futurewhere medical diagnosis will be based on the full genome."
5,An excellent photo history of corps life up until 1984.,"The book is a photo history of life in the corps from 1980-1982. It shows the strict and unique life in the Cadet Corps as it was up until 1984 when changes were made. It focuses on the outfit Squadron Two and the traditions that make being an Aggie special. It's tough and challenging, but worth every minute."
5,Excellent - great for rinsing quinoa,Other reviews helped me purchase this product. I needed a larger fine mesh strainer to rinse quinoa. I wanted stainless steel without paying a big price. This product is great for the job and good quality. I'd buy it again.
5,works well for me.,I am using it for making the soy milk. It works well to filter the remains from the milk even I grates the soy very tinny.
3,Not really worth the price,"I chose this product based on a recommendation on America's Test Kitchen TV show. Our old strainer just happened to come apart the day before, so I went online and just ordered the one they recommended. I was surprised at the mediocre quality of this highly rated and high priced strainer. The screen of the unit we received doesn't have a smooth ""bowl"" shape; it is a bit distorted on one side. I would have expected better quality control for the price. Otherwise, it does strain stuff."
4,Good size and a very well build strainer,"This is a great strainer, it feel very well built, very solid, and is very comfortable to use. It has a nice lip on the opposite side of the handle to rest it on the side of a bowl or pot. The mesh is very fine, something the size of a grain or rice won't get through, but maybe something like chia seeds could sneak past. I wish it were a tiny bit finer, but it works perfect for most everything."
2,Not very fine,"Hello,I could certainly say this is indeed a strainer made with stainless steel mesh. However, very fine is far from applicable to it's mesh. There is little more that can be said. This mesh was no more fine or better at filtering than any product not labeled for it's density in meshing. The product isn't a total failure, but it is still not to where I expected it to be."
4,Good Heavy Structure,Unit is made from a good heavy quality of Stainless Steel. It definitely is not flimsy. The lip on the front of the strainer is nice when placing the strainer in a pot. Only downside for me was the part was manufactured in China. I would have preferred a unit made in USA.
5,Great for my macarons,I required a fine mesh strainer for my macaron recipes and this is very fine. I definately get a work out getting my powdered sugar and flour through this. My flour and sugar come out super fine.
3,Pricy,"This was a bit smaller than I expected. There are strainers with a similar fine mesh in cooking stores such as Williams Sonoma that are less expensive. Since you can't handle it before you buy it online, I thought I was getting something better than I did. I feel like I overpaid for this."
3,There I received the product.,"There I received the product is still impossible to comment. It may be that when receiving, comparing with what I can change my opinion"

5,engaging the enemy,"If you are going to engage the enemy, you better have the knowledge and the weapons. This is Bob's best and most complete work for those who, willingly or not, are to engage the cohorts of the devil. Bob's experiences and his categorization of knowledge and weapontry with respect to spiritual warfare are invaluable."
2,Falls way short of quality of other bible movies,"This movie comes from the old archives and some scenes are repeated. If you are used to the quality of the Bible Collection movies, you will be disappointed."
1,Not good for knitting big kids' socks - missing sizes!,"I just bought this book as I wanted to knit some socks for my 10yo daughter. From the reviews it seemed like it would be a good book for me as I like the versatility of being given measurements based on gauge, then being free to innovate from there. She has size charts for men based on shoe size 6-15, for women, shoe size 5-12 and for kids, shoe sizes 4-13. So if you happen to be a kid shoe size 1-4 (which both of my children are), then you're out of luck. This book was a very frustrating purchase that I regret making."
5,Great sock resource,"I have done a few socks from various patterns in this book but kept looking at the reticulated ones - like the green large one on the cover. It just looked so complicated and that made me hesitate. Well, I was doing a hat and decided to try one of the patterns; that way if it was too fiddly could just do an inch as a band on the hat and quit. To my amazement it was fun to do and quick and loved it. I have some Regia Silk out now (black for the solid and a patterned one for the second); going to make some really different looking socks and enjoy every minute of it. <G> This book is a must have for a sock knitter."
4,Experience helps,"I don't think I would have been able to use this book without some experience knitting socks. There are lots of beautiful options, but you need to have some background and be willing to do the math."
3,Not easy to follow along if you're a beginner,"I was disappointed with this book. I am new to making socks and thought this book would show me how to knit them step by step with a lot of pictures along the way. Unfortunately, there weren't a lot of pictures that helped the brand new sock knitter. Buy this book if you already know how to knit socks but would like to try another method - like 2 circular needles. I did find a lot of useful information in here.Still, I found myself using the tutorials online to help me for free instead of the book I just bought."
2,Beginners beware,"I searched many titles and I am sorry that I ended up purchasing this one. I had to abandon my project as the explanations were just hopeless. If you know how to knit socks already, this book has a lot of beautiful patterns. But if you don't, unless you are way smarter than I am, you won't be able to learn from this. She just assumes that you understand things that a beginner just has no way to know.I unraveled the project I started based on this book, and I found a wonderful website with a free beginner pattern and detailed photographs that worked perfectly for me. So I wasted my $$ on this book.I am an intermediate knitter who just completed her first pair of socks, and while they turned out beautifully, that was no thanks to this book."
2,The Best Sock Book Yet,This is such a great find! It will take years of fun and exciting as well as challenging knitting to make all these sock combinations. It is the best sock book I have found.
5,great sock book!,"I just recently finished my first sock, following the directions for the class sock in Schurch's book. Very well written instructions. I was able to complete my sock with just a tiny little bit of help from some friends who are 'expert sock knitters'. I'm feeling confident and ready to move on to more socks, and maybe some knitted Christmas stockings!"
4,Sensational Kniited Socks,"The book is what I expecected. Good basic patterns, with clear explainations. Many old traditional ones with a slight twist."
4,Beautiful Socks!,"Loved this book when I checked it out from the library, so I bought it. I would like to make almost all of the socks in the book and have even ventured to try some other stitch patterns on my own.My only problem is that so much time and energy go into the making of a pair of sock, it seems a shame to wear the socks, and consequently wear them out! If you can get past this, you'll love the book and love making and wearing the socks!"
5,Really good book!,"I am really impressed with this book. I have several other sock books, but this one has things none of them has. I have already learned a lot of new things which I am using in my current project. I love the way it tells you how to adjust the patterns for a custom fit. There are lots of patterns for a variety of yarn types and LOTS of stitch patterns."
5,Sensational Knitted Socks,"A very helpful book, particularly if you are a beginner like myself. My friends say it is very helpful to them also and they are not beginners! It is quite handy to carry around and use for reference. It would be even handier if these types of books were bound differently. Several of us took ours to a copy shop and had a ring binding put on. That way you can lay it flat while knitting and not lose your place. When I asked my more experienced knitty friends which book would be the most helpful for a beginner sock knitter, ALL of them recommended this book first."
5,Great Choices! Easy to Use!,"This book gives many options for knitting socks! You will never get bored with the same pattern over and over. Easy to follow and gives directions for several avenues to knit (4 kneedle, 5 kneedle, or circular needles). Would highly recommend for knitters with some sock experience. Not for a true beginner but for advanced beginner. Love this book and have shared with others as it gives directions based on the size of the sock you are knitting. Great book!"
1,1ST EDITION ERRORS GALORE,BEWARE! If you happen across the 1st edition: walk away!! (Unless you want to print out half of another book just correcting the errors.)Nearly 30 pages of corrections are now on Publishers website for this book. Some as entire pdf files. The whole mess should be converted to one file. Publishers should have to exchange books that go this wrong 1st time around.
3,best I've seen yet,"This book is alot better than most of the books I have on knitting socks. The patterns are interesting, the yarn choices are vared and I like the instructions MUCH better than any of the Vogue books. I haven't had time to knit any of the patterns yet, but do have 2-4 marked out to make. I'd recommend this book for someone who has a good idea of how to knit socks."
2,Bummer,"This was my first book by Ms. Letts. My mother has raved about her work forever. I saw the movie ""Where the Heart is"" and decided to give this booka try. I found the story to be slow and unbelievable. There were holes in the plot and the characters were not well developed. I kept telling my husband that I was gonna finish it just to find out if finding out the answer to the questions made it worth reading in the end. The answer to that is ""NO."""
4,Review from Texas,I don't know where Billie Letts gets all these characters. This is a good book and one that keeps you turning the pages. The story line was good and I love the twists and turns that keep you guessing. I gave it 4 stars because there are so many characters that it is sometimes difficult to keep up with all of them. However the main charcters are like people you know. I would recommend this for a good read.
5,Best book I have read this year.,I loved this book so much that I read it in 2 and a half days. I could not put it down and was up all night reading it. So sad when I got to the end. The only thing that I didn't like was all the characters in the begining. I could not keep them all straight. I highly recomend this to anyone who just wants to read a great story. Mrs Letts is a great storyteller and I cannot wait till her next book.
1,Anti-Adoption Message is Disheartening,"Billie Letts' latest novel was so disappointing in that it takes a vehement stand against adoption. Basically it asserts that mothers who give up their children don't love them enough to keep them. That's patently untrue, and caused me to be concerned about, 1) young women who might read this novel and feel that this is a prevailing opinion, and 2) men and women who have been adopted feeling that their mothers didn't care about them.Frankly, this spoiled the whole book for me."
2,a bitter disappointment,"After waiting for another book by this author, I was truly disappointed by a run of the mill whodunnit. I should probably call it a ""whocarewhodunnit"". I found Ms Letts's first two novels engaging;filled with interesting characters. This story is simplistic, filled with a cast of characters one can barely keep straight and in the end everything and everyone seemed forced. Shoot The Moon was neither a good mystery nor an interesting character study. Without giving anything away, the questions that Nick (the main character) gets answers for and the relationships that he forms are not remotely fulfilling or well-defined. I wish I had waited for a library copy...it's definitely not worth the money."
3,Shoot the ending,"Not a bad book, but the ending stinks. I have enjoyed Ms. Letts' other books, but this was not that great. Also, I got tired of all of the knocks at Republicans. I don't buy books, watch TV, go to movies, read magazines or buy CDs to have artists give me their political views. Just stick to what you know best....writing, acting, whatever and leave the political views to the experts."
2,First Time Billie Letts Reader - Big Disappointment,"I chose Shoot the Moon for my read at the beach book for this summer. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I never cared about the charactors, the writing was simplistic and the conclusion was wrapped up too quickly. Beverly Hills millionaires don't behave like Mark Allbright, the charactor of Ivy was not fully developed - I never got a feel for who she was and she and Mark's relationship was completely unbelievable and the reason for Gaylene's murder was just plain ridiculous. I never figured out who shot Mark. Did Ms. Letts reveal this or did I miss it?"
4,"good, but not HONK AND HOLLER","I about jumped out of my skin in Barnes and Noble when I saw this book. I had no idea Ms Letts had FINALLY written a new novel. Since HONK AND HOLLER, I have been waiting anxiously. While I did read this book in about 7 hours, so I must have been involved..I don't think it or its characters could hold a candle to HnH..CAFE. I found myself smiling with amusement, whereas in her previous books, I would laugh out loud.Still, I would recommend it, and I will still anticipate Ms Letts next novel, but I wasn't as engrossed as her first two books. And I am sure the characters won't stick with me the way the cast of the HONK AND HOLLER did. They become best friends:)"
5,Hard to put down!,This book is the perfect mix of romance and mystery. A very good read and readers will not be disappointed.
3,have yet to finish,I have yet to finish this book. I bought this book because I loved other Billie Letts books. couldn't hold my interest.
2,Average,This book was full of holes that made me want to put it down. I finished it because I down loaded it. I don't know where she came up with the idea that she knows all about how to portray the life style of Oklahoma folks but she was made a mess out of it. Shame on you Billie.
5,Oklahoma Culture,"Billie Letts has a wonderful way of conveying the Oklahoma culture with her story. As a native Oklahoman, I really appreciate the way she translates what the characters are thinking in clear and understandable vernacular."
2,Contrived,"I thought I would like this book since I own and loved the book Where the Heart Is. While I did finish Shoot the Moon, I found the story too contrived and forced. I didn't particularly like the characters (or the strange names) so I think from the beginning I was not engaged in the story.I was glad that I borrowed this one from the library. Just not my favorite book."
3,Shoot the Moon,"This was a quick and easy read. The story was interesting but you could guess what would happen at the end of the book. I would recommend it as a fill in for more interesting, suspenseful writers."
4,"Oh, this was a good book!","I really enjoyed reading it! It had a little bit of everything thrown in - intrigue, murder, romance, and plenty of excitement. The characters were all interesting and the resolution, though bittersweet, was fairly satisfying. The plot twisted along in pretty unpredictable ways, too. I would definitely read another one of this author's books. And it was a fast read, too! Though I must admit, the whole cousins thing was rather troublesome for me for a while. And while the whole end took me by surprise, the very end was pretty sad, though I suppose there just wasn't any other way to end it... I'll be keeping an eye out for her other books now, that's for sure!"
3,"Good, but not great","I enjoyed the book's story, but I didn't feel that the character's were fully developed, and the writing seemed more simple than her previous novels. I would still recommend reading this, but checking it out from the library rather than buying it."
4,Billie Letts does it again,"This book is filled with her colorful eclectic cast of characters that by the time you are done with the book, you feel you have known them your entire life. This is not my favorite book of hers, but it was certainly well worth the read."
4,A Film That Takes You on a Journey,This film has great atmosphere (the bar was a little scary - not a place I would hang out at) and excellent acting - I didn't see any (acting that is) so I know it was good! It is good to watch a movie that is well done with some good pool action and at the end leaves you thinking. This is what a film should be.
4,"Pretty, but one small concern","It's the same as for their purple necklace - the sides that go around the neck are a little too stiff, so the necklace moves around a little too much when you move your neck, I wish they were more flexible, so that it draped better."
4,The Art of War is a good book,"For anyone interested in this subject, the book is a great survey of combat art printed in a large color glossy format. Good edition and well made."
3,Going West...,An excellent resource for teaching about the West. Lots of information and hands-on crafts for children to do.
5,Iran is awesome,"If you like noisy guitar pop, i mean noisy, guitar, pop, this record is perfect. their self-titled debut is equally great."
2,Not Worth It,"I bought this for my 9 yr. old son for Christmas 2004. It lasted about 8 mos., then quit working. Not a good buy."
2,No what I expected,"First of all this DVD player was part of the my search for ""portable DVD's"". i was looking for a portable to take on a trip this summer with my daughter. When I saw it I ordered it immidiately, when I got it I was like ""this is big for a portable ;-). Anyway it is not a portable and it does not look like the DVD that is displayed. What I received looks like a cheaper version of what I saw online. The Sponge Bob is painted on not etched in/molded in as the pic. Mine is not square but more of a rectangle, the buttons are not round or are at the front but are square and are at the sides. Mine also has these ""photo negative"" looking stripes down the sides. Come to think of it ...........I am not sure that I got what I paid for."
4,very nice tools for the price,"difficult to clean the regular way because they are made of woven wire, so be patient, but they do the job better than any old basket strainer or wire mesh tool. The absolute best for frying chips or dumplings."
1,The handle disintegrated from some kind of rot,"We bought this one and the bigger one. Didn't use them at all and they sat in the utensil drawer. One day we went to use it, and the bamboo handle had disintegrated on the inside!! Weird! The other one seems fine, for now."
4,Too cute.,"These are really cute. I am going to look for other colors. Beware that if you have large stretched out earlobes that these may not work for you because the wires are fairly small. Also, the color of the blue is much lighter than the color shown. They are more of a light baby blue color. Still pretty, but I like that rich blue shown and would rather have had that color. However, these are still a keeper."
3,Good item--poor mailing,I sent this as a gift but they did not included note. So the recipient did not know it was from me!
4,beautiful and elegant,"these are another good pair of earrings - they don't turn my ears green and they're not too heavy. i love the silver ""flower-shaped"" beads that hold the pearl in place...the only reason i gave it 4 stars was b/c i'm not in love with the tiny blue bead above the pearl... it just detracts somehow (in my humble opinion)but then, honestly, who in the HECK is looking at that tiny bead??? come on! you're moving, talking, getting coffee... who's looking at the little bead!!!great earrings - i would buy from Gem Avenue again."
2,"SCER033 Sterling Silver Leverback 1.5"" Drop Earrings",They looked better in the picture. I wouldn't buy anything from these guys again as I can't tell from the picture what it looks like.
2,"catch 22 for an otherwise amazing artist, poor presentation of album","Leilani is a fantastic artist.. but I just do not understand for the life of me why her CD doesn't play. Apparently it's copyright protected. but this cd doesn't play anywhere--not in my laptop, not on my stereo cd player, and not in my car. There is no point selling an album, if you make it unable to play by the purchaser. You cannot even properly listen to her clips either here on AMAZON because of this dilemma. Poor choice on Leilani's part, and is to both her disadvantage and the disadvantage of the listener. Next time, just release an album and forget about the soapbox copyright B.S. !!"
1,Hand Written Size Change!,"I ordered this product for my puppy because I thought it was so cute. I actually ordered a size small, however, on the actual tag the seller wrote over the Md (for Medium) with an S (for Small) with a black marker! Unfortunantly I missed my return window since it is just now getting colder and I just noticed the tag....because it looked so much bigger than a small! I think this is a terrible thing to do to a customer and I would not trust anyone that would dilberatly do something like this!!!!!"
3,Not aweful,"It seems like the compilations are losing their touch with each newer one. The first was amazing, the second alright, and the third was not all aweful. It didn't seem to me that the tracks were mixed together as well as they were with the first cd, but that might just be me. Great price though."
2,Sims guides ??,"cool stuff, but how much of this isn't available free, online, if you bothered to look ?? A great purchase for the lazy (and Newbies - Bob or otherwise) but if you have the slightest motivation Google has cleared it all up for you already."
3,Could use work,"I thought the guide was pretty good, except that all it is is a clearer form of the manual! I found out some things, like how to remove doors and windows. The only things that were different was that this guide had cheat codes, and all this ""a day in the life of"" stuff. Plus, it tells you about jobs. I could say it helped a little, but I wouldn't recomend buying it."
2,"Sims Guide: Looks good, does nothing","This book isn't a very good guide. much of the stuff in it you can work out yourself. it is good for a first time player perhaps, but it can be boring with small print, lots of tables and charts, and only small black & white pictures. if youre an experienced player, give it a miss"
2,Not for the True Novice.,"Although some sections of this book were really fairly useful and clearly written, the fact that the 'type-in' examples didn't work was really frustrating. We'd spend hours following the directions exactly, (hitting the exact keystrokes specified) and get nowhere. Finally, we'd get creative and use what commands we did understand to complete the exercises. This is good if you're trying to learn creative problem solving, but not so good if you want to learn all the features of Autocad LT. Also, the book didn't give enough real world examples to explain where different commands and features would be useful. This is not the right book for the beginner."
5,Great Stuff,"I used it for a sinus infection where I lost my voice completely and had a sore throat. I found this product on yelp and went to an herbal Asian store in Chinatown in Phila. I only paid $2.50! the only difference is that I didn't get tea bags they were dissoluble cubes you place in the hot water. It worked great. It took a few hours to work but it worked!. The next day I had my voice back completely and no sore throat. One night I woke up from terrible post nasal drip cough, took a cup of this tea and it eliminated the cough and put me right to sleep. A must buy, its cheap and natural. You cant go wrong if you give it a try."
5,THIS PRODUCT WORKS!,Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed. I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants. This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work! I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders. Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine. Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work. Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in. Seems to last for 3-4 hrs. No side affects that I can tell. So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed. It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.
1,This made my whole house smell very badly,I used this tea once and it made my whole house smell so badly. The taste is a whole lot more tolerable than the smell. I tried it a second time and had to infuse the tea outside on my patio. Not something I would EVER purchase again. I did not notice any results for what I had to endure. Save your money.
2,Didn't work for me,"I had high hopes when I purchased this produce, shipping was amazingly fast and I've tried it a few times. I don't enjoy the taste, and since I don't sweeten my tea, it wasn't that great, and it did nothing for my sinuses. Will not purchase again but I do recommend the seller."
1,No effect for this sinus sufferer,"I bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache, earache, toothache. I drink multiple cups over a few days, and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. Taste is so-so, but that's not really what matters. As every sinus sufferer knows, if eating dirt would make the pain go away, we'd eat dirt."
5,Very effective tea,I used to take sudafed for my stuffy nose. I tried this tea and felt relief immediately. I usually drink this tea twice a week and have not yet felt the stuffy nose. Would highly recommend.
5,The Jury,"The acting in this dramatic presentation is superb. Derek Jacoby and Gerard Butler are, as usual, outstanding. One of the more refreshing qualities of television series made in Great Britain is that, rather than attempting to ""glamorize"" the characters, emphasis is placed on the reality and believability of the characters. I found myself quickly drawn in and caring about what was happening in the lives of the various people being portrayed in this series -- which is, afterall, the true test of good entertainment. If one wants to get lost in another world for a few hours, this series is worthwhile."
5,The Jury,"First of all you must know that English is not my first language. But it was very clear and easy to understand , even so it has no subtitles in Spanish. The plot is very good and showed me many aspects of England. And also I``m a great fan of Gerard Butler , who is such a marvellous actor. But all actors in the Jury are very good and I recommended it to all my friends. But they will have to buy their own DVD in amazon, because I wouldn``t part with mine!"
1,Very Bad Photography!,"""The Jury"", shot with multiple cameras, all apparently hand-held, is the worst photographed Granada Television feature I've ever seen! Strictly amateur throughout Part 1,that I just watched [3 January 2009]. My rating--because of bad photography--jerky, badly edited, heads cut-off in extreme close-ups--I give this turkey 1 star [or half a star!]."
4,Gerard Butler did a GREAT job in The Jury,Just orderd the DVD because I am a big Gerard Butler fan. He is a great job in this. I think all Gerard Butler fan need to see this.
5,The Jury,"The Jury was a very well done, six episode ""Masterpiece Theatre"". The performances were stellar by everyone. As most of us have sat on the outside looking in on a trial of this magnatitude, The Jury gives all outsiders a glimpse of what it would be like to sit on a jury, for such a horrific crime. It made me question if it is possible for a juror to come to a conclusion that is fact based only. The Jury was emotional and seemed very true to however brief a time you sit as a juror it could change you forever. I thought it also depicted the very real hate that people have against people of different cultures, and sadly that is a true reality. What type of juror would you be?"
5,An interesting look into British Justice....,"after spending the last seven years working in an Americian Courthouse is was very interesting watching this mini-series on this British Judicial System. The stories of the lives of the jurors within the story of the teenage murder, was done very well. It is well acted and well directed. Worth the money for the set. Even my teenage son found it interesting! And for a kid who just likes to watch things blow up, that is saying a lot."
5,"""LUV'IN EVERY MOMENT OF IT""","Oh my, I couldn't be happier with it. I have the Zen Pause in my car so that I may listen on the way to work. This music seems to set the tone for my day. I'm in a very mellow state the whole day thu. On the drive home, Zen Pause is there soothing every mile. I hope I never tire of it.................."
2,First song the best,Like so many CD's the first song is usually the best and the rest are mediocre to forgettable. That's the case with this CD. I heard the first song at Pandora and liked it immensely. I bought the CD for that song only to discover that the rest are forgettable. If you like the first song and have an Ipod buy it only and forget the CD.
5,A Great Upgrade,"I wanted to upgrade to Photoshop CS and add Acrobat Professional. For the extra money, I decided to go all the way to the Premium Suite. It was a great decision.As a the owner of a web design and development shop, I have already found uses for InDesign CS and Illustrator CS, programs I never thought I would use.My favorite part of this program is the file management system. It is easy to use and convenient.One drawback is the upgrade does not come with documentation. There are web based PDFs, but no books. It is daunting for an old dog like myself to open a new program - particularly one as complex as this one - and start a new project. There is a CD with video lessons that helped, but nothing beats a book in your lap when you are lost."
5,"This is an amazing, fun, creative resource tool for everyone","Tired of the same-old-same-old books about how to be a better this, a firmer that, a more successful whatever? Then Living Juicy: Daily Morsels For Your Creative Soul by SARK (stands for Susan Ariel Rainbow Kennedy, by the way) is your tonic, your balm, your absolute necessity! This is a remarkable book. Its simplicity is deceiving--an exercise a day to help free one's creative spirit--because these are some real issues here, and some real fun ones, too. Do yourself and everyone you love (or even just like a little bit) a big favor and get this book. It is an extraordinary tool, creative and spiritual, thought-provoking and fun"
5,Very Inspiring,"The mix of positive thoughts, bright colors and cheerful artwork in this book are a great inspiration to all who want to be more creative. Whether you want to write a book, or paint, or a crative chef, this book, like all of the book by SARK can help tremendously. When I can't think of something to write on my blog, I often flip through the pages of a SARK book for ideas."
5,I love SARK!,"I have several of SARKs books, and Living Juicy is as wonderful as the rest. Every morning, I read the page which corresponds to that date for a positive start to my day."
4,Different kind of Daily Bread,"I saw this book first time in my friend's place, and I like it just by viewing the cover and the scrambled handwritings! So I asked my aunt to search for me a copy of this book because it is not available yet in my city.My first impression of this book is that this IS a real Daily Bread. Daily Bread is a short Christian spiritual reflection in day-to-day basis. So does this book, but the content is not any Christian stuffs but life's stuffs. The books uses colors and pictures, and the text is formed in a short passage, makes it interesting and easier to be read (especially for first SARK reader!). Yet, the power that it has will amaze you...SARK is simply asking you to join a world of joy, filled with wonder and beautiful things that may be passed unnoticed in daily life. This book will takes you to travel inside and outside of your world, expand your view, and fill your new view with amazing scenes of life..."
2,For the silly ones,"I suppose this book is kindof cute and fun to thumb through on occasion, when the silly moods hit, but I don't know that it really holds all that much useful advice for daily life. I loved SARK when I was a teenager. Now that I'm older, however, her advice doesn't really seem that useful for the real world."
5,An incredible inspiration and written from the heart!,"Sark's book, ""Living Juicy"" has been an incredible inspiration for me personally. I like to randomly open a page and see where it takes me. The page I end up on always fits what's going on that moment. Often I am inspired to write in my journal and I always reflect and look inward. This book brings a refreshing new approach to ""daily meditation"" books. It is colorful, creative, compassionate, fun, unique. The handwritten text adds a special touch. I can feel Sark's personality pouring from the pages. Her heart and soul went into putting this wonderful piece together. She is a person I would like to know. Read this book and buy copies for all your friends. It will be cherished! Carol Dreyer, LMT, Portland, Oregon, handsrwise@aol.co"
4,Every Morsel FEELS good!,"I paid full price for my ""Daily Morsels"" but it has been well worth the $15.95. I bought this delicate ensemble of happy colors and personal ventures to continue helping me on a daily basis with my creative prowess as I strive for complete and total saving of my chaotic Soul! Good Job, SARK!"
1,"The book was supposed to be new...the binding was creased, the cover was warn","This book was supposed to be new. The binding was very creased, the cover was very warn. It was supposed to be a gift. Clearly a used book"
4,Liszt not sounding technical? the magic touch...,"Murray Perahia at his finest, making Liszt sound amazingly colourful and not just a crass display of technical pyrotechnics. Substance and style! Enjoy."
5,Remarkable Recording of Gnomenreigen,I have never heard such a brilliant recording of Liszt's Gnomenreigen. My heart was racing with excitement through the whole experience of listening to it. His masterful technique allows him to really open up the musicality of this performance. Unbelievable. Truly amazing...
3,Capuccino cups,"I found the cups rather small - a native of Italy, I have seen those cups in many coffee bars - they're the workhorse of the coffee bar. As such, they're very sturdy, resist high temp washing, but lack in design or decor. I also found the glaze to be defective - sign that these are not very high quality manufacture, possibly seconds.All in all, I use them but will not be heartbroken if they break and need to be replaced."
4,really happy with these,"They get a bit hot to the touch and require a few minutes of cooling before serving other than that no complaints. Sturdy, dish washer safe and look very nice for company!"
3,"A Bit Predictable, But Overall Good Movie....","I must admit with another reviewer that this movie is a cross between Mary Poppins and Arsenic & Old Lace---- though with a modern twist!!Be prepared to laugh throughout this movie as the characters themselves are outrageous & very well acted by cast members: Patrick Swayze plays the perfect sleazy golf pro, Kristin Scott Thomas plays the perfect part as the bored housewife to a small town vicar and is not a goodie two shoes, nor is she the ideally suited wife one would expect from a vicar's wife, and of course has kids out of control!! And who can forget Maggie Sweet as the star of the show!! Sweet's character comes across as a gentle Mary Poppins type on the surface, but beware of what is just below the surface!Funny must see movie, if you enjoy British comedy & dark humor!!"
4,Mummy Dearest,"An excellent British black comedy with a stellar cast. If you enjoyed movies like ""The Lady Killers"" and ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" you are in for a treat. Maggie Smith plays the housekeeper that visits the family with a mysterious trunk. Having seen the trunk at the beginning of the movie with a dubious history, we the audience are in on the joke. As circumstances unfold with the family, we see any problems remedied by the disappearance of said problem. Eventually of course we literally see where the bodies are buried. I enjoyed it as a rental and now intend to purchase it to add to my black comedy collection. Good quality family DVD without extras."
5,Keeping Mum is a real keeper!,"What a fun and clever film 'Keeping Mum' is - after watching it, I had to buy a copy of my own so that we can see it again and again.... talk about a great black comedy, with brilliant performances from Maggie Smith, Rowan Atkinson, Kristin Scott Thomas and more. It reminded me of the brilliant British films we used to see, with murders happening left and right, but no blood and gore, and no offensive language - I can't say any more or I might ""let the cat out of the bag"", but do yourself a favor and watch 'Keeping Mum'!"
4,Don't miss this movie!,"For anyone just now running across this title, it is a gem! Maggie Smith is the most lovable murderess, Kristen Scott Thomas is wonderful, Rowan Atkinson is adorable, and Patrick Swayze's part is so unexpected and hilarious. Prepare to watch it over and over to catch all the twists and turns, but it's a joy to watch each and every time!"
5,"Excellent, Wity Film","I had rented this movie and loved it so much, that I had to purchase it. It is excellent and wity while addressing issues that face many families. I highly recommend this film to anyone, be careful though there is nudity so take care not to watch with children around. :-)"
2,Disappointing: A 30-minute Sit -Com Padded Out Into A Feature Film,"We were expecting a comedy, and kept waiting for this film to be FUNNY, but it was only barely so. It took almost the first whole hour just to set up the story's predictable comedic end, and felt like a 30-min sit-com padded out into a feature film to accommodate a big-name cast. Maybe it's too subtle for my wife and my tastes -- but we found it disappointing, not that funny, nor touching. Maybe some will find it enjoyable for its love-story theme and recognizable actors/actresses.If you want more enjoyable comedies on similar themes (murderous elder women), try ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (a classic) and John Water's ""Serial Mom"" (campy, over-the-top)."
1,DVD in wrong aspect ratio you lose picture. Not first time!!,"The company that issued this DVD also released Tidelands. Both are wonderful films and, as films, rate 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, the company decided for unknown reasons (especially given that the British DVD releases of both are in the correct AR)to release both in 1.85:1 instead of the film AR of 2.35:1 (you probably understand the point, but just in case, you are losing picture on one side or the other OR on both). Humorously, the company claims to be about independant/important films but seems to not respect either the films or their potential customers. The company deserves 0 stars but......."
4,A Killer of a Movie,"Anyone reared or married into a minister's family will enjoy a vicarious revenge in Maggie Smith's uninhibited, unrepentant determination to level the playing field for her family. It was strange to see Rowan Atkinson in a mostly serious role but he did a good job, mixing sincerity with ""serious"" humor that only the English can do. I thought the ending was over-the-top and wasn't true to the family's character but the rest of the movie was good enough to make the flaws tolerable."
4,British black comedy at its best!,"Terrific storyline with the usual British black comedy theme. Superb acting by all. If you like soft chuckles and a little light lewdness, this film is for you."
5,Keeping Mum,I loved this film. What a surprise. I never thought I'd love the villian. All the actors are top notch so you could hardly miss with it being a hit. Would highly recommend.
5,Keeping Mum,"A marvelous black comedy, and a tour de force for the wonderful Maggie Smith. Without giving away the plot, suffice to say that Maggie's a hoot as a husband-killer turned nanny for pastor Rowan Atkinson, wife Kristen Scott-Thomas and their teenage daughter. The late Patrick Swayze is excellent in a supporting role. Highly recommended."
5,delightful!,"funny and serious. this doesn't always work, but it does in this perfectly balanced film. wonderful performances by real pros."
4,Maggie Smith fans will NOT be disappointed!!!,"As a big fan of Maggie Smith, I couldn't miss this film after reading the reviews. I usually don't like ""noir"" comedic films but this one really worked for me with a delightful cast and fun throughout! Highly recommend this film especially if you love British films as I do!"
4,Very British Dark Comedy,"I happen to be a big fan of British comedies, even though I'm American. I rented ""Keeping Mum"" because I enjoy Rowan Atkinson's performances, and even though he's not really the central character in this movie, he does a fine job -- as do all the actors. Indeed, the casting is just about perfect.The movie manages to make light of a number of basically grim topics - most notably murder - and it's definitely not for the kiddies. But if you like wry humor, and aren't put off by swearing, partial nudity, and a lot of violence (mostly off-screen) then ""Keeping Mum"" will tickle your fancy."
3,A really nice surprise.,"Despite, not so great reviews by the critics, KEEPING MUM is a really fun film and a treat for those who like ""black"" comedies."
2,What the heck is this doing under Christian movies?,"I have reviewed the movies included under you ""Christian"" movie section and you have a few that are good and a few that are simply religious, but many of the section are simply out of place.A ""Christian movie should have Biblical content that isn't twisted by spirituality or some Hollywood addition that perverts the teaching of Christ. But this one is really puzzling to be in this content section."
2,The eye of a storm,"No You Love Us spurts from this album. Nicky uses more direct words and you know what he means. Not a masterpiece like GT, and The Holy Bible. Not as good as EMG but it is the Manics and they still mean something. As a Manics fan I prefer their earlier stuff, many new fans like EMG and after, but Im a new fan and like the Richey era. This is nothing like the Punk of GT or the sorrow of The Holy Bible. It is on it's own. Nobody loved You does seem the perfect song on it, singing mostly about Richey, it is a beautiful piece. I would never insult the Manics but this is not their greatest, it is still better than all the junk in the charts at the moment."
5,Brilliant,"Forget the Oasis', Travis' and Coldplays of this world. This is British music at its very, very best. A political band that give real meanings to their songs to great effect. The CD casts a spell on the listner with special songs, most notable being 'The Everlasting', 'If you Tolerate this', 'You Stole the Sun from my Heart' and 'Tsunami'. If you enjoy british music i can not reomend this to you enough! You will not be disappointed."
2,"Sadly good songs, however not a good album","I love the Manic Street Preachers. Always have. I even loved it when they changed direction and went off doing If you Tolerate this. I still like them when they further went on and released their next album know your enemy (Rage Against the Machine Fans maybe???). But both albums lack the direction of Holy Bible or Everything must go. Although singular tracks such as ""nobody loves you"", ""if you tolerate this then your children will be next"", ""Black Dog"", ""Ready for Drowning"" and ""You stole the sun from my heart""; the album slowly plods along playing tracks that sound too similar and too unlike the manics to be memorable. Although it complete's my record colletion its not one that is played often... or at all"
5,This album is head and shoulders above the rest! The best!,The Manics are the best band ever and this albun proves this. It has style and really catchy lyrics. I can really get caught up in the atmosphere of a real manics concert(which are the most brilliant experience ever) The best songs are you stole the sun from my heart and if you tolerate this. They are an example of first class music! I would seriously recommend this album to relax and just chill out. Listen to it when you just want to chill! Log on now and listen to it right now- if you have any taste in music at all you'll fall in love with it at once!
2,The Truth Hurts,"Oh what a story. The perfect band for a Rimbaud poem. The promise of revolution in the bed with You Love Us. A second album that time & ears forgot but remains a coveted prize. The third a bird with it's wings clipped heading for the cat's mouth yet the most incredible statement of human suffeing put on record. The fourth a desperate cry for answers to their own actions. And then their was five. This album defines dissapointment in every sense of it's given up termology. The Everlasting is everlasting in it's dullness(in words the most). The singles tingle every nerve that causes mass headaches. Please take it from someone who's been there since '91 and has fallen for there every breath, this album is a dud. Stick with there first four & let this be the album taste forgot"
1,This record is truly limp!,"After reading all the laudatory reviews I decided to pick up this domestic release (Everything Must Go was a good, solid album), but this thing just sits there! I'm sorry these guys are all depressed and all, but give me a break! It's all slow songs that go on and on, some with horns and crappy extra instuments... these guys have gotten way too pompous. Would picking up the pace occasionally tire these guys out? Do they actually stand for an entire concert? The last thing I want to listen to is rock stars sharing their intense anguish over the world's problems. I can't believe these guys are so huge in the UK and Europe. Arena rock suffering... why are people fawning all over this?"
1,Not what it could be,"I bought this album, my first Manic Street Preachers cd, after hearing the superb Ready For Drowning. I LOVE this song! No question that this is the best track on the cd. Unfortunately it is also the ONLY good track. The rest of the songs sound too 'formula', there's nothing new here, just the same old pop that I would hear on the radio...not a good thing. Overall, it's just not my cup of tea."
1,i hope my one star kills the average (hehe),"out of all the albums the manics have made this is pretty sh*tty. itys what i think they always wanted to stay away from, constant radio play ,video play etc... some bands are in just for the money but i though the manics were different well guess not. still u can trust in brothers in sound not to sell out any time soon. dont buy this is my truth..... save your money and buy their older and much much better stuff(ex holy bible)"
2,To Tell You the Truth....,"...this record isn`t all that great. It`s a decent listen and a competent rock album, yet it seems somehow dated and formulaic. Almost all the songs follow the same formula, and if it`s alright in the beginning it soon gets repetitive and tiresome, given that the strong choruses and grand melodies lose their appeal and get a bit boring and unsurprising. This effort lacks edge, it`s way too shiny, polished and clean, and at parts it really is dull and predictable. There are some good moments to find here, though (""The Everlasting"", ""If You Tolerate This Then Your Children Will Be Next"", ""My Little Empire""), but as a whole this effort is just average and unmemmorable.Not a keeper."
1,Sadly Disappointed,I bought this disc on the suggestion from some people whose opinions i previously valued. Lets just say i doubt them now. This disc is filled with tepid melodies and even weaker vocals. Its hard to find where the band actually picks up their own instruments because orchestral arrangements are so overused on this album. Instead of sounding epic it just sounds severely overthought and unfelt.
2,"ahhh, keep yer truth","i'm stunned that so many people like this. is it really mostly holdvers that five years ago were wearing black eyeliner and cutting themselves? cause i can't see how this cd would bring many new converts. sadly, it sounds like anything else. james' voice remains very strong, but the songs are just not good. i dont like knockin them or comparing them to the way they were, because they are now a different band, but i dont like it."
5,Exellent,"The Manic Street Preachers are one of the best bands in the world and this album proves it. They have a distinct sound that makes you want to here more. P.S I would like to point out that they are Welsh not English, so please do not call them England's best band."
4,IN THE BEGINNING... WHEN WE WERE WINNING...,"As a reluctant fan, having heard the name Manic Streets Preachers thrown about for years before actually hearing them, I guess I am not exactly qualified to review them based on what they have become. I don't know what they used to be or sound like. I only know that when I heard this album, I felt inspired. It struck me as something different from what I had been hearing. There is very little cynicism here and a lot of informed hope. Yes, there are hints of a social conscience, and while many artists write to causes, the Manics are not overt, are not condescending. They just play music. I can say that this album inspired me through many long days of work... in which I put on headphones to block out all the rest of my co-workers. This album has all the elements you look for: great lyrics, meaningful, rich music, very satisfying overall. Height of brilliance in the songs. This is a must-have."
1,bottle lip broken:(,"Hi,The product is almost unusable. Due to the chip in the rim of the bottle, it has allowed air into the product. Not the product's fault. I had been wondering how to deal with my problem when you sent this comment request today, wonderful.How can we remedy this situation?"
5,Awsome,"This is a great CD. I like the popurris on it especial Popurri de Toros, Popurri Tomas Mendez and Popurri Jose Jose. This is one of Sol's best works."
4,Favorite rockabilly.,"I saw this band in concert like over a decade ago, not even sure if they're still together. Has some great classics updated with a modern edge. Tennessee Stud is my personal favorite, with Slewfoot close behind."
4,Works on Vista - but remember to select USB for printer port not LPT,"It actually does work with Vista but you have to remember to do two things:1. Remember to select USB for your printer port when setting up the printer you will be connecting this to and not the traditional LPT1 that you might be using for a parallel cable.2. Connect the cable to your printer - then turn on your pc - then turn on your printer so that it will recognize your new printer connection.I was about to send this back as non-functional until a read a few reviews of folks who had success. Still need to try it with my laptops that use XP and Windows7.The only negative, which is really a big one is that lack of easy to access instructions make this very confusing and frustrating for those of us who aren't real savvy. But the price beats the $25 at our local Radio Shack."
5,Works perfectly on Vista computer with older single function printer (HP722C),"This cable worked perfectly for my HP 722C on a brand new Dell PC with no printer port. I had read in reviews or somewhere else that these cables would not hep if your printer was multifunction (or that only the printing function would work), so since my printer was just a printer, this cable worked fine.Was deliverd within about 3 days from the order."
1,IF YOU HAVE VISTA -- DON'T BUY THIS!,Any positive reviews have to be from people with Windows XP or older. This does NOT work with Vista! The packaging doesn't list Vista nor the installation CD. False advertising here!
2,Not suitable for Aladdin Hasp dongles,It creates a virtual usb printer port. A basic parallel printer will probably work just fine. The Aladdin Hasp dongle requires a LPT port. For reading and writing to the dongle bidirectional is also necessary. Mapping the usb virtual printer to the LPT port did not make any difference
1,Does not work with Vista,"Simply put. This cable does not work with Vista as others who have reviewed have said. The description says it does, but that is false advertising. I have spent too long trying to get it to work and am throwing it away. Not worth sending back."
1,Waste of Money,"If it works for you great. There are NO INSTRUCTIONS. I connected the usb like you normally connect plug n play, waited for the drivers to load, then the printer. NO JOY. I downloaded printer srivers and saved those and ran them & reconnected printer. Still NO JOY. There is a ""button"" to set the priter online or offline. It was ONLINE, drivers loaded, etc. When I tried to print test page data was sent to the printer but nothing else. The test page hung in the que. I paid a computer whiz and she determined I had done everything correctly.Not worth the money. Wasted 3 hours of my time.Did I mention the parallel plug is flimsy. It snaps together and was loose when I opened the package.Do not recommend."
1,Didn't work.,"I got the one that made Chinese manufacturing famous. It moved the print head on my Panasonic KX printer then died. I subsequently tried it on the dot matrix and a Lexmark laser printer. The device was recognized and drivers installed by Windows XP and Vista, but no data goes to the printer. Return shipping would be half the cost of another adapter so instead of returning it I'll just put Sabrent on my list of manufacturers who rely on Chinese quality control."
1,Does not work,"Could not get this product to work at all.Did I smell something burn?When I look at the partially translucent 25-pin connector end, it looks like something is burned inside.I suspect it burned up being plugged in to printer & USB port.I threw it in the trash rather than take a chance of further damage to my expensive computers/printers."
2,Works sometimes,"I had an older injet at home (HP 722) that was never opened, I send it with my son to college. He is using a Dell notebook with XP Pro. After installed it worked. Every time he removes the cable from notebook then plugs its back in he has to do the following to get the printer to work again:- Delete the installed printer in control panel/printers- Go into my computer properties then hardware and delete the usb device.- Turn off the computer- reinstall the usb cable into the computer with the printer off- Then turn on the printer and reinstall it in windows.I found this solution when searching the internet so I am not the only one having this problem. Unfortunately no good solutions to connecting a legacy printer."
5,Works! Fixed problem.,"Had to replace my old desk computer. My old HP 1100 laser printer would not connect to the USB port on the new computer. This connector serves as a 'jumper' between the old HP printer cable and the new computer's USB port. The old HP printer worked fine - ""plug and play' with no problems."
5,Perfect!,"This was exactly what I needed to hook my 4 year old HP printer (w/parallel port) to my new laptop (which came with Windows Vista, and no parallel port). The product comes with a disc to install the drivers needed (but my printer is so awesome, I didn't need to use it.) I just plugged it in and it printed. This is perfect!"
5,Works great with Windows 7,Works great with Windows 7 64-bit and a HP LaserJet 5SI Mopier. Truly plug and play no problems or concerns.
1,Worked for 10 minutes on Windows 7,"Driver CD does not support Windows 7 but a quick response from Sabrent tech support showed me how to install effortlessly on Windows 7. Unfortunately, the connection failed after about 10 minutes and would not re-install on the same USB port. Installed on a different USB port with the same results-- success then failure after about 10 minutes. A computer tech friend advised me that he has had little luck with any of the USB-Parallel port adaptors. Recommendation: install a parallel port on an open PCI slot on your computer. This adaptor works for some people but in my case it didn't. At a low price it may be worth a gamble. Decide with caution."
1,worthless adapter cable,"I recently bought a new iMac and my wife has a Dell laptop, neither of which has a parallel port. Both machines can only print using USB, so my old HP 1100A sits just collecting dust while I've tried to find a solution.HP and Best Buy both said I was out of luck with no cable to connect USB to this type of printer and I should junk it. Most new laser jets don't work as well as my old one so I've been searching for a fix for 6 months now.I found this cable on Amazon and thought it would solve my problem. Well it did for about 6 weeks and then mysteriously just stopped working. There is no way to troubleshoot it, no documentation, and the 2"" installation CD does not work in the iMac.It also stopped working on the Dell laptop at the same time. I would definitely recommend NOT wasting your money on this item. I'm going to try the following item instead -Cables To Go 16899 6 Feet Usb To Db25 Ieee Parallel Printer AdapterGood luck!"
1,WILL NOT work on WindowsXP 64 bit,Did everything I could think of to make it work. Just not designed for WindowsXP 64 bit
1,Length is a problem,"This printer cable was advertised as 6' long, but it is really 4 1/2'. We were counting on and needing six, so we will send it back. It seems like false advertising."
5,Thinking person's game,"Wow! What a fantastic game on so many levels. I would agree with folks that say it is a bit daunting to learn when you first start, but if you are patient and take the time to read the manual and online help included in the game, you will get past the learning curve and have a great time with this one. All the fun of a boardgame like Monopoly combined with the addctive nature of collectible card games like MTG make this hard to resist. The graphics are nothing fancy, but are more than adequate - afterall the focus here is on gameplay, not glitz. If you are looking for a good multiplayer game, or are a fan of collectible card games you can't go wrong!"
1,Lasted 1 month then died,Worked very well when it worked but unfortunately after about a month of owning the product (only 2 charges and maybe 4 hours of use MAX) the charge light began flashing orange when the device was plugged in. The device no longer charges and now does not work at all. I have read many other reports of the same problem.
4,Works Great with Blackberry 8700c,"My first BT headset, so I can't really compare this with the other ones out there. I have used it for over a month and I am really impressed with the quality of sound and the speed at which connection is made with my phone. The only issues that I have had is with the amount of talktime that I can get out of it. I almost always need to recharge the headset every other night or sometimes every night. I probably talk about 40 minutes every day on average, not more than that. But other than that, I have no complaints so far. The voices are loud and clear and my voice also carries through very clear (according to the people that I have talked to using the headset)."
4,"Comfortable, Affordable, and Easy to Use BT Headset","I use this headset with a V3 Razr and have been very pleased with the performance. I've worn the headset for an hour at times and it's not a problem having it on. The sound quality is very good although there is some ocassional static on my end. This is my first BT headset, so I think the static is probably a consequence of the BT connection rather than the headset itself. The people I have called tell me that the headset actually sounds better than talking into my old Motorola V265 phone. Overall, the headset fits well, is easy to set up and use, and provides very good sound quality. For the price, this headset is a good value that's going to be hard to beat. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Clear but uncomfortable,The Logitech Freedom Bluetooth Headset provided clear voice communication with the cell phone (Treo 650) but was noticeably uncomfortable to wear. The section that fits behind the ear was thick and unwieldy. I returned the unit and got a Treo headset with worse reception but a more comfortable fit.
4,Good BT Headset,"I have used it now for 2 weeks with a RAZR V3 and I am satisfied it works as advertised. It was very easy to pair the headset with the phone. The sound is good even in noisy environments. The headset is light, confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off, answer, dial and pair. The button is also a LED indicator. The LED flashes diferently (different colors, intervals) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button. After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off, pair or use voice dial.At $42 it is a good deal."
3,Great sound quality - poor comfortability,"After doing a comparison on a number of Bluetooth headsets, I chose the Logitech Mobile Freedom based on positive customer reviews and the Windstop technology. After a week of daily use, I returned the headset. I found the sound quality to be excellent; I could hear others quite well through the headset and others found my voice to be clear, especially in the car. However, on the downside, the Logitech is somewhat heavy and cumbersome to fit over the ear. The ear loop is not well-designed, making it very difficult to modify to one's ear. Compared to other models, it was difficult to quickly place the unit on my ear and it just kept falling off. I am exchanging it for the Tekkeon EzTalker Mini, a much smaller, lighter unit."
5,Top notch headset!,"I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands. I use the device with a Motorola V551 phone (Cingular). It works geat! It charges very quickly and the charger folds up in a compact fashion when not in use (the electrical prongs fold up into a recess in the charger). The unit holds a charge for a long time. I left it in a drawer for a month, pulled it out and it was still ready to go!I use the device a couple of times a month on business, when driving, etc. The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open. some people complain about the ear piece. It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily, but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one. Then it becomes second nature.the sound is great, the phone detects the device quickly, its fairly comfortable. All it all it performs just like a device twice its price,"
4,Works for Mac OS X 10.4.6 as in/out device and VOIP,"I bought this headset hoping to connect to my Macintosh. Pairing was quick and effortless. I have used it as both an input and ouput device. And it works with both Skype and the Gizmo Project. I get 30 feet through the walls of my apartment just fine. I can even get to 40 feet with some static.I concur with most reviews on its good and bad points. But, think that most complainers do not read the instructions. It is a bit heavy. And the fit is not the best. But it is adjustable in ways that are not obvious w/o reading. It is my first BT headset and larger than I expected compared to those seen on the street. So it is not fashionable. But, sound quality is good.Overall a good value."
1,Received two; neither will turn on.,"I have received two of these headsets, and neither of them will even turn on. Searching user forums reveals others have had this problem -- apparently the latest batch has major battery issues. Maybe there's a reason they're discounted so deeply?"
1,Flamed out early,"I ordered this headset in mid July and it died in mid September. The charging LED just flashes if I try to charge it. And the battery is probably dead as it won't turn on. Also, I never found it to be overly comfortable. Not bad enough, that I would have gotten a new one because of its lack of comfort. But, bad enough that I wouldn't want to wear it for an extended period of time.On a positive note, I had no problems with its voice clarity or use in windy conditions."
3,great as long it worked,Using with Nokia 6230. It worked great to start with. Then it stopped charging and was dying after 20-30 mins of talk time. Now it has unpaired with my new Nokia 6230 (same model - new phone) and is not anymore recognized by it. So it is useless to have it with me. I really hoped it works great... but has a sad ending.
1,"Good, but battery died","The good news: Functionally, this is the best headset I have ever owned. It fit well, I could hear callers and they could hear me.The bad news: The battery was supposed to provide 7 hours of talk time. I never got more than 6 MINUTES. I'm returning it to Amazon, hoping to get a refund. Since a number of other people have reported this same problem, I'm giving it one star. Evidently, Logitech has serious quality control problems with this unit."
1,should have thrown my money in the trash,"this is the biggest piece of sh** there is , i have only been able to use it once since i got it brand new , gave it a full charge paired it with my phone and it worked great , for about 1 hour NOT 7 , so i recharged it thinking maybe it just did'nt get a full charge , well now i have to re-pair it every time i even attempt to use it , and cant get the damn thing to do what it's supposed to do half the time ( like the simple task of turning off ) if i have it on stand by it works for about 5 min. then it completley loses everthing and i have to pair it again !!!!!i have always been a logitech fan but i will never buy a logitech bluethooth again plus i will buy from a store locally so that i can take it back ( i did not try to return it with amazon because i did not want to go through the hassle )so to put it short DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!"
3,Fantastic... until the ear band breaks,"I had one and loved it -- the windstop feature worked great! Good volume, good voice quality, good weight/fit on my ear. It was hard to tell that I was talking from a headset.But after about 10 months, the rubber ear band snapped. :( I treated the thing very well (because I liked it so much). The problem seemed to be that rather than having some kind of thick metal wire running through the core of the rubber band, there is a thin plastic rod that eventually breaks, even if you are careful with the band.Look around the reviews and you'll see a fair number of people who have had this problem. There's even a pic posted in the customer pictures section showing the same problem. Just a heads up if you're considering this headset."
3,"Good piece, but very pathetic battery life","I purchased this model in December'05 and have been using it since then with my Bluetooth enabled Laptop to have voice chat on Yahoo/Gtalk/Skype. It works fine with all and has a good sound reception. Yes, the wearing of it seems a bit uncomfortable over more then 30 mins of talking. It kinda starts hurting you. Others may not feel that way depending on the quality of their ears...:-DJokes apart...What I did not like is the battery life of the model. The manual says 7 hrs of talktime, but between charges, I hardly get 2 hrs of continuous talktime. I charge as per their instructions, but still till date I have never got above 2 hrs of continous talktime..forget the standby. I hope Logitech is listening to this."
1,Absolute waste of money,I have had this earpiece on the charger for over two weeks now and I can still not complete a phone call before it goes dead. It usually lasts for no more than 10 seconds before shutting down
2,Don't Work if you Can't wear it.,"The Logitech Freedom Headset came with great reviews from many prominent sites and publications. I found these reviews to be very misleading. The biggest problem with this headset is the earloop. It is difficult to put on and very uncomfortable. No matter how you set it, the device squeezes your ear. This, as opposed to the Sony-Ericsson HBH-600 I also recently purchased which is easy to put on and very comfortable.The secondary issue is the weight. Its simply too heavy to be comfortable for long stretches. Again, in comparision to the, admittedly, more expensive Sony-Ericsson, which extremely light.On the plus side, pairing this device on both a Treo 650 and Motorola V710 was very easy. Sound quality was acceptable on the Treo and very strong on the V710. Sound quality is not an issue, however, if you can't wear the device.Obviously, I was very disappointed."
3,The best of the ok...,"Bluetooth technology hasn't yet caught up with it's marketing department... this is the second headset I've used with only slightly better results. My main problem is volume, seconded by battery life. This is a fine headset to use, but compared to my wired headset - the quality isn't even comparable."
3,Cheap and sturdy...,"This product is surely cheap and sturdy.... but hopefully (for the sake of other headsets out there) not the best!The voice quality for domestic calls is decent, though much is left to be desired when making international calls. It can cause some pain in your ear initially till the rubber/plastic round thing becomes a little flexible over time.Overall its good value for money and works for a long time on a single charge.. A good first bluetooth headset... but probably not the ""only"" one you may wanna have."
1,crap,this thing is pure crap! It doesn't stay on your ear and is a piece of junk! Don't buy it...its a waste of money
5,Very Good Headset,"I purchased this headset on someones word and let me tell you, I didn't go wrong. It was very easy to setup with my MOTO V-557 phone. It is plenty loud enough, in fact I had to turn it down. ( I'm a little hard of hearing) I ask a few people that I was talking with over the headset how I sounded. They said real clear, then I told them that I was using a headset and they couldn't believe it. They were also very clear on my end. One thing that bothered me was, it kind of hurt my ear after setting for a few hours but HECK, the quailty of the headset made up for that. I don't use the headset everyday, so I can handle that part just fine. Don't just take my word for, try it and you'll see."
1,Too heavy on the ear!,"I've only used the unit for 30 days, but already I dread having it in my ear. The weight of the unit makes it uncomfortable and so too does the rubber piece that raps around your ear to hold it in place. Sound quality is OK although at times it is not very loud. It synched up well with the Trea 650 which was fine. Overall, if you are going to wear the unit for any period of time the weight will ruin your experience. FYI, I've ordered another model to replace it."
3,"Decent, no great.","I did expericence some wind noise, but not alot. I had some issues with the strength of the signal to the phone. I however do no know if it is my phone (RAZR V3c) or the headset. Really was hoping I could connect it to my powerbook, but I guess that is not something supported on the mac for this headset.... just a heads up"
3,"5 stars for comfort and clarity, 1 star for durability","It looks a bit clunky, but this is a comfortable & great sounding headset. Battery life is oustanding. Setup a breeze. Paired easily with my home Mac, a company PC and 2 different Motorola phones. Only problem is the ear loop. Mine broke after 4 months. Logitech doesn't sell replacement parts and I didn't save my receipt for a warrantee claim. 2 other people bought this headset on my recommendation. One broke theirs break within a week of mine. I'm aggrevated Logitec doesn't stock parts, so I'll probably try a competitive headset. If you decide to buy one, put the receipt in a safe place. My experience suggests you'll have a 2 out of 3 chance of needing it real soon."
4,Logitech bluetooth freedom headset,Received this item about the middle of August. Ear piece is large and volume can be turned up even when used in a loud environment. Headset stays paired very well and have had no problems when using it with my Treo 650. I have not tried any other headsets but read many reviews by others on other different headsets and finally decided on this one account of price and the ability to hear with it well. Drawbacks are the size and the comfornt while wearing it could be better. I look for these things to get better as we go foward.
3,Little heavy....and had some problems,"Even though it was a bit heavy/bulky the call clarity was very good. Was able to pair it with my Treo 650 without any issues. After couple of weeks, I couldn't charge the headset at all. Amazon sent me a replacement and that worked only for few months. The headset was getting discharged pretty fast with talk time of only 30 mins tops or standby time of half a day to a day tops. Gave 3 stars because as long as it worked the call quality was good, no static even when I was outdoors or driving. Overall if you are lucky enough to find a headset in great condition it would be a good buy."
1,Logitech doesn't communicate,"I tried both this bluetooth headset and the HS04 V01. Neither felt comfortable on either ear. The instructions were sorely lacking. Sound quality was loud enough, but poor (lots of static) with several different phones. Worst of all was the battery life - talk time of about 10 minutes just after a full charge (and with attempts to condition the battery). Two failed attempts for Logitech are enough, time to look elsewhere."
1,Worst Headset EVER!,"I bought this when I gave my Plantronics headset to my husband. It was cheaper, so I thought, why not? BAD IDEA! I'll never go cheap with bluetooth again. This thing pokes off your head like some kind of growth, and no, it's not adjustable. It just always falls off, and is just plain annoying. I'll never buy anything like this again. Plantronics all the way from now on. If I could give less than one star I would."
1,Doesn't hold charge,"I've tried and tried and tried... the headset dies after a half hour, even on standby. I've left it charging all night, no good. Maybe I got a dud? Unfortunately I left it in the package for a really long time and my warranty was no longer good. Don't buy this piece 'o S#$&."
4,Works great but not sure about Windstop,"very clear, lightweight... the ear piece takes some getting used to in putting on one-handed. the device paired with my blackberry 7100t without problems in about 30 seconds. it is supposed to have windstop technology and other reviews have said that it works great but with all my windows closed and just my car A/C on, callers have said that it sounds like a windtunnel so I'm not sure how well the windstop actually works."
2,Not up to expectations,This unit sat so lightly on my ear that it allowed a large amount of surrounding noise to enter my ear making it almost impossible to hear the other party. The mic worked fine and the other party said they could hear me fine. The ability to hear the other party was so poor I returned the unit.
3,"Sounds quality good, but too heavy","This product works very well, but it is just too heavy. It pulls my ear down and is extremely uncomfortable. My left ear started to droop after a few months even without the earpiece on.The wind noise elimination (a rough surface that creates turbulent flow from laminar) works very well, but catches on all fabric but the smoothest."
3,"Low Cost, Easy to Connect","This is an OK unit. Easy to connect and works. Sound quality and volume is not an issue. What is? The wind noise. Any conversation outside where there is slight wind, it can be heard. Same goes if you walk at a brisk rate indoors. No issues if you are sitting at your desk having a conversation. Battery life is fairly short compared to other models. So if this unit cost is low at the time of your purchase, go for it. (under $25). Anything over that cost, buying something else."
2,No way,"Good sound nd price, nicely connect with mobile,,, however NOT WORK at all with my PC neither MAC... Once it's connected with my moble, they refuse to get in touch with any PC. they don't connect with 2 diveces in same time, it's OK,,,, but even if turn off my mobile nd renew all profile, still it's not changing. No Connection with MY PC,, so I was expecting use this for my Skype but NO WAY. real cheap gadget :("
1,"Great electronics, poor electronics.","The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken. Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much. The voice quality was great on transmission and reception. But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced. I got a new headset the first time on warranty. The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle. I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech."
2,Two strikes - you're out,"I purchased this headset based on great reviews through Amazon. I had to return the first one because the battery wouldn't even last 24 hours on standby. I received another one, free of charge. The battery life was much better. But, the ear piece just broke after only 2 weeks of use. I simply went to remove the piece from behind my ear and it snapped off for no reason! I'm trying a different model now..."
4,Good sound quality but bad fit,"Sound quality and battery life are great. But the weight and fit of this headset is horrible. I find myself always having to adjust the earpiece to get a good fit. When it does fit well, it works well. Forget about taking it out of the car 'cause it's just too bulky. Most of the time I'm too embarassed compared to the Motorola bluetooth headsets."
2,Very heavy and uncomfortable to wear,This headphone has execellent sound quality but it is so heavy and uncomfortable to wear that it is almost useless. The design of holding ear is really terrible. It holds it so hard that it changes the shape of ear. May be I have slightly bigger ears but other headsets works well.
3,"Not great, not terrible",This was the third of four Bluetooth headsets that I've owned. I've had it for about a month. I'm using it with a Verizon Motorola V710.Pros:- That Windstop thing REALLY works. All the other Bluetooth headsets I've used are more or less useless out-of-doors. This one is great.Cons:- Difficult to get comfortable on my ear.- Connection between phone and headset drops more often than other headsets- Sound is a little static-y.
4,Good economical headset,"It can be a bit fiddly to get on the ear until you figure the trick: Hold it with all five fingers, with the index finger on the back of the ear loop opposite the loop's hinge, and push it away from the earphone speaker. It can then slide over the ear from the top.When in standby mode, it picks up inbound calls pretty fast. But I wouldn't try to use it to answer a call if it's off, becuase to turn it on you have to press the button for 4 seconds.My only real problem with it is not specific to this headset, but to all wireless headsets: not quite loud enough for me to use in a car. It's louder than the Motorola I tried at twice the price, but for something this big, it could go louder still. This is certainly a problem with my ears rather than the headset, though."
1,Good sound Awful to wear,"Purchased this based on customer reviews. This item has good sound quality, specially in windy areas. Here comes the BUT....trying to place this device on your ear requires a great deal of effort and then some. It hangs off your ear with no real way to adjust it. I finally got rid of mine and decided to order an SE HBH-610 aslo through Amazon, I will rate that later when it arrives. Logitech seriously needs to invest in testing this item on people before putting it on the market. If you are looking for an easy to wear BT headset, this is not the one."
4,Great,I use it with my notebook and it works great!The only problem i had was to find the Widcomm drivers for my bluetooth adapter...Headset works only with these drivers!After i've installed drivers the headset has been recognized immediately by WindowsXP and started working.Talk time is excellent (up to 8 hours)!!Buy it!
3,Only average,"I have to confess that I don't have a lot of experience with battery powered headsets. I have been using a Plantronics (corded) over the ear headset in the office for 10 years and love it. The weight is behind the ear which I think is the key.The Logitech just felt like it was hanging there with most of the weight on the front of the ear - it just kind of flopped around and while I wasn't afraid that it would fall off, I was all too aware that it was hanging there. Sound quality and distance (25 ft.) were good, but volume was totally unacceptable in anything but a quiet environment.I've returned this and ordered a Plantronics Voyager 510 which looks more like it will have the features that will be better for me."
3,Logitech Mobile Freedom Bluetooth Headset,"The quality of the product is great! I can hear sounds very well, and the person on the receiving end doesn't even know I'm on a hands'free set. It also lasts for a long time without needing to be recharged! However, this thing seems very heavy on my ear and can be somewhat uncomfortable. If you have a sturdy ear, this is a great product for you! Otherwise, next time, I'd get a smaller version."
5,"really cheap, yet great headset","I used to get complaints from callers when I used a wired headset in my truck with my Treo 650. This headset seems to keep some of the interior truck noise to a minimum.Very fast and easy to pair with my Treo 650. Only a 2 second delay in connecting when getting an incoming call. Feels very comfortable on the ear. Only problem is that it resembles a male sexual organ. If you can overcome that, the value is unbeatable."
3,Works but uncomfortable,"Great value and pairs well with my Sony P800, but ear fatigue sets in after about 20 mins. I also have tried the Jabra 250 and it is MUCH more comfortable."
2,"Works fine, but hell on the ears","The quality of sound and signal were fine with this, but the actual putting on your ear is a nightmare. It may just be that I have big ears, but getting this thing on was a struggle. My phone would ring, and by the time I had it stable on my ear, the call had already gone to voicemail. I could just keep it on all the time, but then it hurt my ear. After a few days I gave up and returned it."
2,Logitech letdown!!,"I waited for this headset with anticipation and was sorely let down!! I don't know who's ear's this was designed for but i do know they are not human. I have played with this thing so many different ways and it never fits, falls off all the time and looks plain stupid on!!Also, the volume is so quiet that it is unuseable whilst driving (the whole reason i and many others want a bluetooth)!!The only redeeming feature is the battery life. You can use it a for a week and not have to recharge it.My recomendation....look elsewere!!"
3,Good unit but rapidly diminishing battery life,"Very comfortable fit. Voice is loud and clear. No complaints regarding the mic either. That said, I've had this unit for about 6 months now and the battery life is going down rapidly.....to the point that I now have to recharge after a 1-hour call. No comparision to my Motorola HS-500, which simply lasts and lasts."
5,Great Headset!,"I love this little thing! It was easy to get started, even for technology-impaired me, and sounds great. It has been easy to use, and comfortable."
2,Uncomfortable and variable sound quality,"I find this headset to be heavy and an awkward fit. At times, the sound has a buzzing in the background and often the volume is not high enough to hear."
4,Better then most,"I've been using the Logitech Headset for approx a month paired to my T-mobile MDA device. The sound quaility is terrific. The wind stopper technology really works. I was able to conversations with my windows down without any problems. The battery life if pretty good. I went 2 whole days without recharging. The only negative thing is the size of the headset. After using my Jabra Bluetooth headset for almost 2yrs, I came accustome to something going around the back of my ear instead of right over top of it. The ear cushion is really nice however at times it feels like sound is a bit muffled. Could be do to the fact I am not used to having something over top my ear.In all this headset got 4 out of 5 stars because of the price, usefulness, and aesthetics."
3,Unsuitable for small ears,"Despite my enthusiastically supporting the Logitech company, I returned this headset. A quarter (coin)-sized cushion may seem comfortable, and represent good design. Consider, though, the fit problem it presents if you have small ears. The headset lies much outside the ear, putting undue outward pressure on the ear from the headset loop. A small ear cannot support this headset.Consider a headset that protrudes even slightly into the ear canal, e.g., a Jabra product."
4,Quite Nice,"I believe that its a good headset, maybe the size is a little too big and weight is not as it seems to be, but nevertheless its value for money.UPDATED :Upon reordering this item, I have recieved 2 defective items, so I recommend that you try your luck elsewhere. The quality control for this item is terrible."
4,NIce buy,The product is good overall.Voice is a bit low.The only problem is the instalation process is not easy on windows.The wrong driver gets installed. Once we change it it works properly.
4,Style or no style,"Ok, I can't say anything bad about the sound quality of this item. However, I do not think it takes a genius to see what is wrong with the style of this item. I'm not going to say exactly what this ear piece resembles, but it isn't that hard to see. Please, just watch the video clip that logitech provides for you on this website. It is obsurd. I just want to know if the person that designed this quit immediately after. I work at a bank and have a wonderful career. However, I'm ashamed to wear this thing and have contemplated selling it simply because of the style. My colleages have actually asked if they could submit photographs of the headset to Maxim. If we win, I get $25 which basically pays for this thing because I only paid $25.98. Anyway, I know this is probably ridiculous, but I wish someone would have told me this before and I would have bought a more expensive (standard looking) headset that logitech makes."
1,worst bluetooth headset I have ever owned,"I will be returning this device. After using it a mere 2 weeks, the battery refuses to hold a charge that will allow you to use the device more than 20-30 minutes. When it worked as it was supposed to, the voice quality and ease use was execellent.My previous Motorola headset worked well for over 2 years before the battery died."
3,Freedom Bluetooth,Bluetooth works fine in strong winds. Blocks out noise really well. Not too good on holding charge but still is OK for the price. Mine does not work as well as the one I had before for 3 years. Vendor I bought from has offered to refund money but does not have one to replace with. I plan on keeping because these are too hard to find and are really the best on the market. GREAT BUY IF THEY WORK RIGHT...Vendor has done all they need to do for me but I will be keeping this item. Thanks to the Vendor for a job well done....
3,doesn't seem to hold a charge,"sets up well with my bluetooth, but doesn't seem to hold a charge for very long"
3,"Works great, but hurts",Pros:- Price- Ease of pairing- Sound quality (yours and theirs)- Battery lifeCons- Painful for an extended time (10 mins)- Hard to tell if on or off
3,"first one good, second not as good","I had one of these for about a year and it was very good with quite little to complain about. I lost it, sadly, and ordered a second one from Amazon. It was defective out of the box, and in concert with a new battery from Cingular that I needed I ended up with one of the new Motorola versions, which has been fabulous in a few days of use. Nothing wrong with this model; if cost is an issue compared to the Motorola you'll be happy. I'm not sure the model of the Motorola; it's the one with the swinging boom and all that."
2,Way too big,"Yes, technically it does work well. But you will never want to use it because it is BIG. And awkward looking. And not very comfortable, at least for me. But seriously, it is BIG."
1,Issues with pairing on multiple devices,"I got this Logitech headset setup with my Apple Powerbook, then my t637 mobile and was grinning from ear to ear. Then, without cause, the headset began to malfunction with both devices. First, my powerbook failed to add the device to sound preferences, even though Bluetooth preference listed the devices as paired and connected. Then, unexpectedly, my mobile phone could no longer find the device, even after bluetooth was turned off on the powerbook. As much as I would love to be using my headset, it now sits lifeless... I am going to have to either try and get warranty help from Logitech or assume I don't know how to deal with Bluetooth devices."
2,Frecuent connection with my Siemens S55,"This hs losses connection (too frequently) with my Siemens S55, it reconnects quickly but interlocutor hears me like a man into a deep hole. Very clear speaking reappears when I pair both devices again but for a short time until the hs disconnects again.Attachment divice hurts my ears even though this divice is so light.The manual is the poorest I have seen. Logitech's web site doesn't have online user's manual nor information about how to do the most common tasks like dial a number using the phone and then transfer the call to the headset, with my S55, first dial the number and inmediatly briefly touch the so called ""multifunctional button"" in the headset: warning!!! don't try to do this while you drive because you will need both hands to do this ""impossible mission"" maneuver.Battery life appears to be excelent (by now, I only charged it once, three days ago)."
2,Not very comfortable,"I like the fact that the headset eliminates wind noise, but it's not very comfortable to wear. It's either too loose and feels like it's going to fall off or it's too tight and hurts your ear."
4,GREAT BUY,"Based on the excellent reviews I read online and the price advertised I said let me give it a try.Great buy easy to use piers real quickly, CLEAR reception and fits real well.The only drawback on a few occassions you get a dropped call, but other thatn that a good product from Logitech."
2,It works,"Yes, it does the work, but it is not a very beutiful product...the ear structure is combersome...And the volume is extremely low, in noise environments it will not work. Sometimes the BT signal gets distorted..."
1,This product blows!,The size and weight of this earpiece made me like and idiot. The ear piece felt like a had a D-cell battery hanging from my ear. I would rather hold the phone to my ear.
4,Good,"It works pretty well. However, the only drawback is that I have not seen any sort of low battery indicator. As the charge nears zero, it just ends up with static. Clearly (no pun intended) they could have done something to better indicated low battery (indicator LED on the outside of the unit could blink red, warning tone, etc.). However, given the price I paid for the unit, I can live with this shortcoming. Overall, very good purchase and I would buy it again."
2,good warranty but breaks easily,I have had the earpiece replaced 4 times by logitec. The over the ear rubber hook breaks and is not replaceable. Logitec has sent a new one each time and extended the warranty to 2 years. It has been discontinued and the replacement now is smaller and has what appears to be a better hook.
4,Real Good Unit,I replaced Jabra Unit with this unit and like it a lot. Jabra has its electronics in flexible part and it broke twice. Jabra refused to replace it second time so I bought Logitech unit and is a better unit and better design. Works well with me and my drive in convertible.
4,Works for sure.. but,"After reading all the reviews here, I didn't think twice before buying this headset which is available for a much cheaper price compared to Jabra bt250.So far, I am happy with it's performance expect for a possible design flaw:I observed that the volume level goes down to a default level every time after a call. So, I have to increase it before making every call. (Use the volume button on the headset.. just takes a couple of seconds) That could be the reason why some other reviewers mentioned about low volume levels. But I got used to it and I don't care any more.. (habit is wonderful thing)Otherwise:- Easy to fit.. Easy on ears.. may take time to feel the comfort as it looks bulky.. (I first thought.. ""is it really made for ears?"")- Long battery life.. charge it once a week (typically)- Works seamlessly with my Nokia 6820"
3,"Good quality, but too bulky.","I got one of these after some serious research and it did prove worth all the effort, except for the fact that the pictures shown never really gave me a fair idea of its size. Although it may not affect everyone, I certainly couldn't live with its size. It sort of sticks out from the ear and is not sleek from any angle. Had the boom been a tad slicker, I'd have give it 5 stars.Bottom line: if you dont care about how it looks, its a great piece with very good sound quality. Although, I returned mine."
1,"Have to return this, twice...","I ordered one in July because of the good review. The first arrived at late July. The manual says charging would take upto 4 hours, but the charging LED went off after 30 minutes. I tried a few more times, but same problem occured: the battery won't hold any charge. In fact, I was never able to turn it on.At that time I thought it might be just my bad luck. So the next day I called Amazon and asked for a replacement. One week later I received the second one. Then I tried to charge the battery, same problem occured once: the orange LED went off after about 30 minutes! I unplugged the cable and replugged it again, yet this time the LED was still on after 6 hours. Later I stopped charging and turned it on. It can be used, but my friends said the sound was a little bit noisy. Moreover, the battery drained after it is used for about one hour... It left me no choice but to return it."
3,Logitech headset,"I have absolutely no problems using this device with my phone. It's functionality is not a good as some of the other devices I have seen, for instance I haven't figured out how I can use this headset to dial from my phone book using vocal commands. That doesn't mean it can't it just means it is not easy to figure out how to do it. The windguard technology is good. It has some problems connecting to my computer when I have another headset plugged in, for instance if two people want to listen into the same conversation, they can't. Overall it does what it says it can do but I have seen some better polished headset products out there."
4,Bulky but liberating,"The Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a little bulky but not heavy. Probably not good for people with small ears. However, once you get used to it, you hardly notice that it is on. The longest period of time worn was 5 hours. Noticed it dropped the connection to the Blackberry a couple of times. Turning the headset off and then on again, picks the connection to the Blackberry back up. Otherwise, well worth the cost."
1,Dead on arrival,"I plugged in the charger, and the orange light came on. After a couple of hours, the orange light was off which is supposed to mean that the battery is now charged. Unfortunately the device would not turn on. So I charged the device for 12 hours with the same result. I was not able to turn it on and see the blue light."
4,Compatiblity with Treo 650,"I have had my Treo 650 for years and have tried several types of headsets. I used traditional headsets as well as a more expensive Jabra Bluetooth headset. Even thought it's a little heavy, this is by far the best headset I have owned. The end user voice quality is better than any other headset. It even better that using the Treo without a headset.As an added benefit, the range exceeds that of the Bluetooth Jabra. I walked 15-20 feet away from the phone with no issues."
4,great,Good reception. It fits OK on my ear but not perfectly. It seems sturdy. Price was better than most. The wind doesn't bother it much either.
3,Headset for casual chats,"I bought this headset in the middle of 2005 and I found this acceptable one in general. I have a motorola V551 phone and it works well with it. Noise quality is often poor and stops me from giving better rating.Pros:* Easy connectivity with my phone.* Voice activated dialling really works. I guess this really is a phone feature and should be supported in your phone. (others who say it doesnt make sure your phone has the support)* Fit - as against others review, I find it fitting well on my ears.Cons:* Battery life, not dependable often.* Noise, I am not sure whether the Windstop feature works.* Not good for VOIP calls. I use VOIP for international calls, and the other end always have a complaint when I use my headset.In general, it is a good headset for casual chats and normal calls."
4,Good acoustics,I have been using this headset for over a month and it does have good acoustical quality even in a car with windows partially rolled down. The only issue I have is that the headset is kind of uncomfortable and pinches the ear slightly so it can't be worn for prolonged periods of time.
4,Works good,I bought this two weeks ago. I have some trouble connecting it with my Sony K700i. Seems like it works better now.It works with my computer USB bluetooth adapter. I use it to listen music and voice chat.
4,People tell me it looks like a PENIS hanging from my ear!!!!!!!!!!,"Mechanically perfect. Windstop really works and is very clear when used in windy areas. That feature alone will continue to sell this product. Stand by time is well over a week as described. Two negatives---It is a bit heavier than I would like, and the guys at work tease me about the fact that it looks like a PENIS hanging from my ear......AAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Microphone too soft,"I use this headset with both my V3 and my OS X computer. The microphone does not pick up enough sound. When using the headset with my V3 it works, and people can hear me, but they often complain that I am very soft. When paired up with my OS X computer, I turn the microphone gain all the way up, but it is still too soft to be usable with skype. I wish this had hardware button to increase the gain on the microphone."
1,Defective unit,"Like some of the reviewers mentioned, this unit is bigger than it appears. But it's pretty light.Unfortunately, the unit I got refused to be charged.. The light would stay red for a few min, then it's off. But if I unplug and plug it in again, it would be red for a few min and then off.anyways.. it's too big for my liking. Back to Amazon it went."
1,Poor quality earpiece renders product useless,"The headset itself works beautifully--easy to use, very clear sound quality on both sides, and no dropped bluetooth connections. However, the adjustable earpiece (that wraps around your ear) breaks easily (even with gentle use), rendering the entire product useless. Although the headset was still under warranty when it broke, the replacement that Logitech sent me (Logitech Mobile Traveller Headset) has also received poor reviews for the very same reason.I would avoid this product at all costs."
4,"Its great, but for one design flaw","The unit is amazing value for money. Its cheap, but doesnt feel cheap, works great and sound quality is tight. I am not too happy with the charging times, but it is 30 bucks, so I shouldnt be complaining much. My only problem with it is the mutli fuction button which also doubles up as the LED indicator. Would it be so hard to seperate them? You have to look for blue LED flashing when powering on till it flashes RED. How the hell are you supposed to see that when you have your finger over it??? Did anyone even test this product before launching it? And for powering off, the Red LED flashes 5 times apparently. So to power it on, you just keep holding the button for a while not knowing for sure if it is on or not.Sometimes little things make a big difference, but I guess for this price, I can live with this."
2,Just the truth.,"Hi,I picked this headset because it had the highest rating from amazon's users. Plus I figured, logitech is good.Well think again.The headset is big and heavy.Although the ear clip is very secure, it takes two hands to put on.I dont like to wear my headset at all times, so if youre not like me, it wont bother you.The wind\noise cancelling feature of the phone is nothing but a foam cover for a standard microphone.The sound quality is very bad, constant crackling in the background.I also have an logitech wireless headset, although it uses a different frequency and technology to connect, there is a distinct ping that I heard on the phone headset and still constantly hear on the xbox headset.I have since returned the logitech headset and bought a us black motorola headset (hs850).Very impressed with the new one.-Edward"
2,keep looking!,"I bought this item because of the previous reviews I've read. In my case they couldn't have been more wrong. The item was very difficult to fit onto ear, and then when I finally succeeded in doing so, took major adjustment to feel somewhat comfortable; that is, if you like a battleship on the side of your head. Sound quality was okay, but not good enough to override the size and fit issues. Off to find another one to suite me better. Good luck"
1,Terrible headset,"Let's see - what's happened with this headset?1. People constantly complain to me that they hear a high pitched whine when I use it.2. The volume of the microphone isn't high enough, even at max setting, so people often have trouble hearing me. (Yes, I've been careful to adjust where the microphone is.)3. It's ugly.4. It constantly drops the Bluetooth connection on me when I'm on a call that lasts several (more than 5) minutes, even though the unit is fully charged.It's Jabra or Motorola time!"
3,"Performance is good, but not a good fit for the ear and doesn't look good","I have Motorola RAZR V3. It paired with the phone without any difficulty. The quality of the sound on both the ends is good. I also tested the windstop technology by standing against the fan. My friend on the other end of the call could not hear the wind noise. It does fairly good job stopping the wind noise.But it is too bulky to the looks. If somebody looking for looks along with the sound quality, then this is not the headset for them.I returned it and got the new Jabra BT250v. It looks great and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is also very good."
3,"Quiet, slightly uncomforatable...","I purchased this ear piece mostly for it's long life battery. I'm coming from using a Jabra.First impressions: It's quiet. I've got the phone volume all the way up and the ear piece all the way up. Now I can hear it ok, but if the surrounding volume gets louder, I'm in trouble. I could year with the Jabra much better.Also, for my ear, it almost doesn't fit. Maybe I've just got smaller ears. This makes it slightly uncomfortable...."
1,Windstopper and connectivity with SP2,"Well i guess i got carried away by the fact that a headset is windstopper and at the same time has a good range, i was mistaken. This logitech bluetooth headset is not even compatible with SP2 microsoft Stack, mentioned only on logitech's website, at the end of the troubleshooting section. I returned the first one because it was defective and ordered the second one. Although this headset was very easy to connect to the cellphone (razr V3), i bought it for my pc so i can use it and it didn't sync. with the bluetooth device. The headset is Bulky can't really hear a lot when you have noise around you and NOT windstopper i tried it when it was windy , even on a fan with multiple speed.I personnally do not recommend this piece."
4,"Good Sound Quality. Poor Aesthetics , Weight, & Ergonomics","I compared this to the Motorola bluetooth headset that comes free with the palmOne Treo 650. I found the Logitech's sound quality to be superior to the Motorola model. However, the added weight is noticeable. Also, it's more difficult to attach the headset to my ear with one hand. And, it is much less obstrusive than the Motorola. Overall, the sound quality, i.e., functionality, won out over the other factors and I chose this over the Motorola."
5,Here's a Great Bluetooth Headset,"I have purchased, and used, 4 different bluetooth headsets before discovering the Logitech. The problems I encountered were static, the person on the other end of the call telling me my call sounded like I was in a wind tunnel or standing behind a jet airplane, not fitting on my ear properly and being somewhat painful to wear, and short battery life. With the Logitech, I am pleased to say that none of these problems have occured. No one even suspects I am using an earpiece with a boom microphone, and the comfort is superb. This earpiece is super. It might not look as modern or streamlined as some of the other models, but in sound, comfort and usage, it is light years ahead of anything I have used in the past. I highly recommend this headset.Doug Scott, Real Estate Agent"
4,good value for the money,"i had bought the motorola HS820 before this one for $80. i have a motorola V505 from at&t.; the motorola worked pretty well, but i thought $80 for a bluetooth headset was way too much. i returned the motorola and picked up the logitech instead and for 1/2 the cost, i was just as happy.it fits a little awkwardly on my ear, but so did the motorola, so i am thinking my ears are the problem. call clarity and voice recognition is good. battery life is good. weight on ear is good. overall, i am pretty impressed!i wish there was some way to adjust the tightness of the earpiece as it feels kind of loose on my ear. would also be nice if the ""on"" button wasn't so small that you covered it up with your finger when you turned it on, making it hard to see the flashing blue light.whenever i use my microwave, it makes the bluetooth connection drop. just warning ya'. ;)"
4,great headset at a great price,"have tried many jabra and motorola headsets, some at twice the price. This one spanks them all."
1,TERRIABLE,I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW POOR THIS PRODUCT WAS MADE. THE HELL WITH THIS PRODUCT. NOBODAY NOOOOOOOOOBOOOOOODY BUY THSI PRODUCT. TALK ABOUT POOR.
2,Nice while it lasted,"I'll have to echo what many others have said. For the first 3-4 months, I had no problems with the headset. It did take a long time to charge for some reason, but the sound quality was good and battery lasted a while.But then, it suddenly became unable to hold a charge. It now lasts less than a day just on standby."
2,Fine for the first 3 months only,"I did not expect the best headset for the price that this headset costs. However, at first I was happy with what I got, considering the price. Sound quality was fine. As stated elsewhere, if the phone is in your right pants pocket, use the headset on your right ear. Otherwise, static. The microphone worked well (actually better than I expected). I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem. Battery life was good. Abount 2 1/3 to 3 months after I got it, though, I started noticing that it kept failing. After some testing, I determined that the battery no longer goes for more than 8 1/2 minutes of talk time. After fully charging the battery over-night, that was the longest call I was able to make with it. So now, it is pretty much useless to me, since the unit is sealed, and the battery can not be replaced."
2,Dissapointing comfort level,While the sound and clarity on this unit is just fine it's quite a bit heaver than most other headsets I have tried and therefore isn't comfortable. I would recommend a different headset.
3,Weak on/off button,"I used this headset for 3 months about 3-4 hours a day. The sound quality is ok, not great, but is much better than the Motorola HS850. It holds on to the ear in a much better way compared to the others. The main drawback is the on/off button. Mine became too sensitive and the sound would decrease while in call or whenever you try to increase the volume. It worked great initially, but somehow went dead after 3 months. If it works, it works great if not it is worse than the HS850!"
3,"Works OK, but noise reduction not great","Pros - it finds the device well and the overall functioning works well.- CheapCons - Quirky fitting on the ear, not very stable fitting.- Windstop seemed negligible"
3,It did its job well,"The headset worked as well as it could. The problems I had with both this headset and my Motorola stem from basic design. The sound coming through he earpiece is picked up by the microphone and retransmits back. Although it sounds great to you, the person on the other end will hear an annoying echo of their own voice. It's their voice feeding back to them. The headset idea is great but the technology isn't quite there. I tried both headsets with my LG VX4400 and Motorola E815 an got the same result with both."
4,Terriffic operation,"This Bluetooth headset operates perfectly, has excellent sound and volume control and was very easy to match up to my razr cell phone. the only thing that I wish was better was the fitment around the ear, there is no adjustment to make it larger, however within a few days I got used to it and now I wear it for nearly 6 to 7 hours a day with no discomfort, battery power lasts for more than the described hours and the nice part is that it's rechargeable. I also bought the auto charger for it from another vendor on Amazon. It's a very good buy."
4,Logitech Bluetooth Headset,I like the overall functioning of the headset. At times it can become uncomfortable as the upper part of my ear feels squeezed. It functions well and I especially like that I can activate voice dial with one touch of the button. The features weren't too clear from the sparse instructions. Can't beat the price!
2,First and the Last Headset I'll Have,This Headset Is One of the best headsets I put on my ear and the first I've owned crisp sound ot heavy at all you won't notice it's on (If you put it on correctly) It was very simple to pair to my Sony Ericsson T610 it only took 2mins to pair and 5mins to master the headset you will not regret gettign this headset I promise you it's just like a Motorola but better it has a nice blue like that blinks 3times if you set it on there some don't know how to turn it off(The Light) but I do simple and my friends can hear me clear get this headset!!!!!
2,Defective!,I understand that mass produced items will occasionally have defects. But when you've waited in anticipation for a week it really annoys to have yours be that occasionally defective unit. In this instance the multi-use button was fubar right out of the package.
1,Logitech Bluetooth - Dead on Arrival,"I just purchased the Logitech Mobile Freedom Headset (Bluetooth) and it won't turn on.I called Logitech tech support and after the tech read a bunch of docs at me, said, ""Well, I guess you're doing everthing right. Its fully charged up and there is no mystery to the one-button to turn it on, so the best thing to do is take it back to the store 'cause there is obviously something wrong with it"".Gee, thanks, like I couldn't have told you that myself. He didn't even want to start a warranty return for me, he just kept telling me to take it back to the store because he didn't want to have to charge me for shipping and handling. What a nice guy.Needless to say, I'm returning it."
5,oh my word,"Dave, you're my wife now...An amazing treat. But you should probably watch the rest of The League of Gentleman series before watching this"
5,Great Recording,"Lopez-Cobos and the CSO give a remarkable performance of this incredible work. It is exciting, beautiful, and moving. The CSO plays marvelously, especially in the brass and strings. My only complaint is that the horns were underrecorded and that the upper winds lack color in their more exposed parts. It's nice to hear a conductor really let the brass shine on the last chord as well. This disc would make a fine addition to any collection or a great introduction to a Mahler work."
5,Possibly the Best Recording of This Symphony,"Long have I quested after a Mahler 3 that carried off the power and almost otherworldly grandeur of the first movement, the deceptively simple (but not simplistic) build of the final movement, and the charming and bewitching character of each middle movement.This is that recording.Besides pleasing interpretation and pacing (read: the last movement does not turn into a dirge as it does in so many other versions), the playing of the Cincinnati Symphony is outstanding. Peter Norton's trombone solo in the first movement is doubtlessly the best available recorded version, and the section plays up to his standard throughout.And, lest we forget, there are Telarc's resplendent sonics. I have been a fan of the clean Telarc sound for years, but this is one of their best efforts, bringing off the warmth of Cincinnati's Music Hall quite well.An outstanding effort by all. Recommended without reservation."
3,it's just OK but i still love the-n,"the only songs i like are the Degrassi Theme song, the South of Nowhere Theme by The Donna's, Alexz Johnson's song (which i don't listen to because i own the Instant Star soundtrack) and the last song, Hold on. i think they should have put like atleast 2 more good songs on this soundtrack. it lacked a lot. the enhanced part was useless to me cuz i do not watch Beyond the Break - (and honestly it annoys me because everytime i put it in my compy to listen to it that thing pops up!!)... i knew this cd was just going to be OK but i love the-n so i bought it anyway LOLz."
4,Good album--but why not reissue the original one?,"This is indeed the Staple Singers at their peak, a period crowned by the live recording of ""Freedom Highway."" But originally that song opened a whole album recorded live in a church, complete with Pops Staples' comments between songs, the handclapping and responses of the congregation, and so on. Hey, Epic Records: reissue the complete original ""Freedom Highway"" (with bonus tracks, if anything was left out!)! And if you ever see the original LP for sale, grab it! A real gem!"
5,Great story.,I really enjoyed this series. I just wish that it would have lasted for another season. The reason it leaves you to pick the ending.
5,Excellent sci-fi thriller,"If you like science fiction like the X-Files, your gonna love this series called The Event that is in the true spirit of almost believable!"
3,Not bad,Not a bad watch but did drag on a bit. Certainly keeps you in though!!! Very disappointing to find out half way through that there will never be a second series.
5,Outstanding Show!,"I am deeply saddened that NBC won't bring The Event back for a second season! I found this series to be fresh, exciting, though-provoking, and very creative. Additionally, it's wonderful to see convincing acting on a television drama - the cast worked well together, the dialogue was inventive, and the pace of the show kept me a bit breathless in a few episodes! With all of the horrible ""junk"" that passes for TV viewing these days, it was great to find a very well-done, well-scripted, well-acted show that provides the viewer with an intense story line, impressive visuals and effects, and a sense of anticipation and adventure. Highly recommended - I'm hoping beyond hope that NBC will consider bringing the show back for a 2nd season!"
5,movie,I bought this for my husband. He loves watching movies and he loves everyone who is in this movie. It is well made.
5,EVENT EXCELLENT,"Fascinating plot with good convincing actors.Can`t wait till the second season is available.If the first season with it`s special effects are as well done,this series would have made a breathtaking scenario,more interesting than `V`."
2,boring compaired to falling skys and V,"I did not feel that it had any ""neat stuff"" like Falling Skys had tech and aliens, this one we started to watch and my roommate dropped out of the race and I use it for background tasks or watch and read the paper, it is not the best or worst, but falling skys, chuck, eureka the series was way more fun and interesting. It just is not enough independance day style for me, more long strung out instead (on and on and ON!!!) and usually I leave pretty good reviews and can sit through alot, even the new ""V"" was way better."
1,NBC... I loved the show... But why should I buy your crap if you canceled it after only two season...,NBC... Why should I buy your crap if you will only canceled it after only two season... You told me it's crap because you canceled it after only 2 season... Really... I'm just so tired watching series that series that you and(other Networks)will just cancel them anyway.. I bought season's of a great series only to end after 2 seasons... Really? Never again... Keep your crap... You labeled it.. then you should keep it yourself....
2,Very disappointing......,"Writing is so bad and full of holes, it really makesyou doubt the leadership at NBC for buying a show like this.You need to shrink your IQ to ostrich territory in orderto escape utter boredom......Plus! Real bad choices as far as actors go too....."
5,Another Amazing show canceled? Seriously?,"A coworker once mentioned I may be interested in ""The Event"" so I watched a couple episodes online on the nbc.com web site.Whoa. How come I didn't hear about these guys when the show was going strong! Purchased the set and after the last espisode my family was on the edge of their seats asking for season 2!Yeah, I nearly had a riot on my hands when I told them it was canceled. One of my kids asked me why all the great shows were being canceled after the first season. The Dresden Files was another we were aching for a second season.There are so many plots and subplots in ""The Event"" which haven't been resolved. I hear stories that another may come in and take over it's production. Sci Fi, Netflix, other's have been mentioned. But nobody has confirmed.Hopefully we won't be left here waiting for ""The Event"" Second season. It's definitely a show that has much more to offer."
2,Do Not Buy If You Dislike Incomplete Series,"The 2 stars may be misleading. They consider this to be the ""complete series"". In reality, this is just Season 1. The series was cancelled. The ""series"" is incomplete. Therefore, 2 stars. It is one thing if the series was a collection of individual adventures or self-contained stories. But, this is one continuing storyline and such programs DEMAND an ending.As to the story, it is a good premise and holds your interest; at least mine. One of the problems may have been all of the character backstories were handled in flashbacks. So, some may have found it a little confusing. Hence, the low ratings that caused the cancellation.Now, there is scuttlebutt that the series is to be concluded on the SyFy channel as a mini-series. If that remains true, then wait until the actual series IS complete before buying. Otherwise, despite the good storyline, I don't think it is worth the investment."
3,"Two great songs, really could've been much better","The first track, ""Radio"", is one of my faves from the album. Same with track two, the bizarre ""Frontier Pyschiatrist"". But there's the problem - only two tracks? No remixes? B-sides? Also allow the fact that track 2 has already been a single. It doesnt make sense. Oh well.Speaking of doesn't make sense, the ""Fronter Psychiatrist"" video, included on the Enhanced CD, is quite bizarre, just like the song it acompanies. A very amusing video, almost worth buying the CD just for it. Overall, if you already have the album and aren't a huge fan, give this a miss. If you don't have it yet, get this tantalising little sampler of things to come."
1,Ugh,"This masterpiece is by the same man who directed The Outfit. 'nuff said? No wait, I've gotta belabor this point. This is horrible. I mean it. Worse than The Outfit? No, it can't be you say. Wanna bet? Try this: Go out and break a glass. Take the biggest piece and put it in your mouth. Chew it. How's that feel? You're having more fun than I did watching this film."
3,NOT Compatible with Quicken 2008 or Newer!,"Be Aware: While this 2006 version of Checksoft is compatible with XP and Vista OS, it is NOT COMPATIBLE for check printing with Quicken 2008 or newer. This falls under the heading of ""less than full disclosure"" from the seller, in my opinion."
2,Throw away your pre-printed bank checks,"It's not a bad product for what it does, so if you needs are very simple it might work for you.IT WON'T PRINT onto your pre-printed checks that you order for your laser jet from your bank. Why? You can customize almost everything but the MICR code. It wants to print this and does not allow you to tell it not too. Therefore if you already have MICR on your checks it will print a second one. I guess this is there way of trying to corner the check reorder process.Also, in voucher form they allude that you can print out detailed information. I found no way of doing that. No way to customize the ledger application. They could have done better."
5,This is a wonderful CD,"I don't remember how I came to purchase this CD, almost 15 years ago. But I still bring it out from time to time and I enjoy it all over again. It's good mood music if you want something light and jazzy, but at the same time with some playfulness and complexity. If anyone reads this and can suggest other artists in this vein, I'd love to hear about it.I looked it up on Amazon to see if Brian Mann had ever released any other works. If he had I would have bought them based solely on how much I enjoyed this one.I'm sorry to see that he has never released anything else."
3,Musical Teeter-Totter,"Brian Mann's CD is okay in my book. Not a great CD but worth a few bucks if only for Je t'aime, We're A Family (NOT ""We're in a Family) and the catchy Dab In Da Mida (scat vocal). After the fifth track, my attention seems to wander. The Red Army Song just doesn't seem to fit in with the other selections but one will have to admit that any artist playing the accordion as the lead instrument has got to be brave. Some of the songs attempt a neo-French sound played with a jazz flare. Reclining Civilization fooled me into thinking the rest of the CD was going to be good. Other than the three songs mentioned above, I can't get excited over the remainder of the CD and can only muster three stars... and I love good jazz. This collection of *songs* just never did find a solid genre focal point so the songs seem to meander into various styles of music without picking some thing we could all identify with."
3,"Nice blanket, but...","After reading the reviews of this product and seeing the price, I wanted to try this blanket for myself. When I got it home, it was not what I expected. The weave was a bit loose (there were several large snags in it) and it was thinner than I had hoped. I would need to use another blanket folded up to provide support. Based on the picture, I was expecting something a bit more subdued with the colors. The one that I got was bright red and yellow - not exactly calming.Overall, not a bad blanket and it will serve its purpose. If you need extra support, I suggest buying two. Just a warning to those who buy thinking it will look similar to the picture...it won't."
2,Quality of the weave much poorer than picture shows,"The quality of the weave was significantly poorer than the picture shows. I was expecting a dense tight weave that would be comfortable to hold restorative postures on, and what I received looks and feels uncomfortable and as if it would fall apart in less than a year."
3,Yoga Blankets,It's okay. Really wanted a blanket made with cotton and wool fibers equally. I believe it's mostly made of polyester and some cotton. Difficult to find cotton and wool as 50/50 content as I've tried other vendors also.
5,A Valuable Resource For Dating On The Web,"I'm a beginner at the ""art"" of dating on the Web, and felt that any insights would be of value before starting the ""journey"". I found Eve Hogan's book, ""Virtual Foreplay"", to be a great resource in understanding the process, and how to to proceed with the best opportunity for success in making contact with, and maintaining connection with my ""soulmate"" (who's out there, waing for me to find her). It also provides a comprehensive collection of ""tools"" that address the questions and answers that must be considered before starting any search for a potential ""significant other"". I now believe that I'm ready to begin my ""adventure of discovery""."
4,An excellent book,This is an excellent book that explains the basic concepts of a high-level mathematical theory in a way that it is understandable by high-school students.
1,BookWorm,"I have read one other book by this author and I really liked it. However, this with Kiss Mommy Goodbye, I couldn't beven get through the first chapter."
3,DISAPPOINTING FIELDING ENTRY,"Having read most of Ms. Fielding's novels, I was very disappointed in this earlier work. Maybe if I had started with this one it would have seemed better than it actually was but her later novels were so very tense and gripping that this one just didn't measure up to expectations. As usual though, it was a female in jeopardy with a menacing husband/ex-husband kind of a story which is her main plot line. It was not BAD but if I had my druthers, I would druther have skipped this one."
2,Who's responsible for this break up/down,"As this book was published in 1981, (it now being 2006), I thought that there would be oodles of reviews. Not so.I took up the book based on the blurbs on the rear cover and I was in need for a page turner. Well it is a page turner. The point of view is that of the narrator, Donna. I must agree with those reviewers who wonder about the narrator. There seems to be a certain streak of madness in her. She does set up scenarios which are bound to fall unto her - it almost as if she wants to be a victim. She as narrator, does provide only her interpretation of events and I think that we as readers, should step back.When Donna becomes ""a street person"", it is unclear how she is supporting herself and just how she is able to snap out of her ""space"". The book seems to run to its conclusion from there on it a hurry.Yes it is a page turner, but I found the characterization of the main character too facile."
3,"Good book, but...","This was unique in the plot, but I found it somewhat confusing because it hops around slightly from the past and the present. It starts out in a courtroom where the main character is fighting for custody of her young children from her very odd husband. I am glad I read the book because it does get very suspenseful when her husband, who loses custody vanishes with her children. I just found that, although her husband is mind controlling, the main character seems a tad on the unstable side, too. I just thought she should have seen it coming, but try it, maybe I was having a mind lapse. See what you think."
4,Heartrending and thrilling,"Heartrending and thrilling From the beginning of the book you can identify yourself in the principal person, Donna. It's never boring it's like a thriller. It shows the different trues. You don't have to be a mother to understand the dramatic situations. Rebecca Sundin, Franziska Küng"
3,Good short stories,"Five of HG Wells short stories read by Ralph Cosham, who sounds like Michael Redgrave. He reads each short story, unabridged, but doesn't modulate his voice to indicate when different characters are speaking, so it gets a bit samey after a while,, especially when he's doing a dialog between two characters and there are no 'he saids, she saids' to help it along. The Strange Orchid: tells of the macabre appetite of an exotic plant. The Truth About Pyecraft: explains why an overbearing fat man wears lead underwear Man Who Could Work Miracles: recounts the problems ofdefying nature. The Purple Pileus: deals with a life-altering fungus Aepyornis Island: a man has a special relationship with a prehistoric bird."
4,Western Digital -> Very Useful,"This 250GB external hard disk is pretty sleak, manageable, maintainable and very easy to use.All in all a decent product at a decent price, especially now that the price has substantially dropped."
5,Great product and good ole amazon,Drive works great. Came with free shipping and fast. I have no problems with it. Just make sure you have a 2.0 usb and youll love it.
1,Good thing I have other back-ups!,"I sat it next to the computer and then began backing-up my folders. I did this successfully once a month for several months. Yesterday it stopped working. That's it...it just doesn't work. It is getting no power at all. I have moved it around the room and plugged it in to other outlets to no avail. There was no power surge, no thunderstorm, no dropping..nothing to explain what the heck happened to it. I cannot recommend this hard drive even if it does look ""mahvelous""."
3,Comes In Handy,"I would have never purchased this drive, but I found it through a really good deal. I have owned it for over a month and it has provided some really benefitial help to backup data and store and transfer mass amounts of data from one computer to another. I can easily transfer data from my desktop to my notebook without having to burn it to media or having to wait for the transfer to complete through a network. I love how it's 7200rpm but I gave it 3 stars because the first one I received was DOA. I swapped it out with no hassle and it works like a charm...but for how long?"
5,So far so good - mac user,"This hard drive has wokred great so far, it looks great next to my mac airport extreme router and is generally a nice thing to look at. It has been knocked over, had its power shut off a lot and still runs quietly. So far I am very happy with it. It wokrs great as my wireless hard drive."
2,"Very attractive price, but painfully slow transfer rates","Before Christmas I found this unit for just under a hundred dollars. I planned to use it to store backups for two of my laptops. Unhappily, the transfer rate was so slow (averaging about .50MB/sec - yes, that's ""point five"") that I found the MyBook not to be useful for this application. I tried the MyBook on several different machines and with more than one USB cable to rule the possibility that the drive was not really to blame. Unfortunately, my results were consistent. I recommend you avoid the MyBook if you plan to use it for high volume transfers."
2,Slow and noisy,"I don't really know why, but this drive is exceptionally slow in my experience. My USB 2 iPod and Firewire 400 drives leave it in the dust.I don't know if it's the enclosure, or the drive inside, which is at fault. I'm tempted to try the disk in another enclosure.Another complaint, though less important, is that it's rather noisy when it spins down."
4,Using it right now. FAT32 Vs. NTFS not an issue,I just bought his today and am copying a 250Gig to the My Book. In the middle I forgot about the FAT32 and got mad that I couldn't copy my larger video files. After some Google research I found this command CONVERT G: /FS:NTFS (check it out for yourself). This automatically switched the drive to NTFS after a reboot without loosing my data I had spent hours backing up. So far a great lil' drive.
4,Working good so far.,"This hard drive was purchased to use to backup my home computer. So far so good. The transfer rate seems pretty good for being USB based and on the PC this was a plug-and-play device as advertised, so no cds to worry about.I did, however try to use this same device on a Macintosh (G3) computer and didn't have any luck. I assume the default format of the drive is the issue, but honestly I didn't have a lot of time to look into why the device was not recognized.Overall, I'd say this was an excellent value for the storage capacity. Although it's not meant for a portable drive, it is compact enough to sit next to your computer and not be an eyesore. I'd definitely buy again for my needs."
1,Stay away from this drive,"I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product. I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA. Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement. This one made it until early March. Three clicks and it turns off. WD says there is nothing I can do, but I return it under a RMA. They can do nothing about the lost data. So much for using this drive for backing up important files. I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size. This product however....STAY AWAY!"
1,Crushed my laptop,It worked all right for 2 days and then crushed my laptop ! My USB ports stopped working after that incident and never came back ! I dont really think that this was a coincidence.
1,Read all of the reviews before purchasing.,This drive has an extremely high failure rate. Mine functioned well for several hours and then-- dead. What an overwhelming disappointment.
1,"Just died on me, no warning","I have the earlier model, silver instead of black, but it's very likely that they're essentially the same box. It just stopped working for no apparent reason. Couldn't access it from my laptop, so I powered down, and it won't power back on again. It was sitting there comatose but powered on, now it won't even power on. No unusual use. Googled ""western digital died"" and got a LOT of reviews where this happened to other people. Be careful. Don't do what I did - all my iTunes content is on there. Every movie, every TV show, every song, every podcast. All gone. Probably forever. Google ""Western Digital died"" and look for a better brand name."
4,Works fine with MacBook Pro (so far),"Got the drive about a week ago for use with my new MacBook Pro, and so far it has perfoermed fine, although I still have to put it through heavy use.Initially, there was a problem: hooking it up to the laptop, it wouldn't mount and the green ligh was blinking, with the drive showing nowhere in the connected device list. Not very promising... But after opening the Dik Utility, it magically appeared, was re-formated to HFS+ without a problem and soon after I was filling it up with backups.The speed is OK, comparing to my LaCie 7200 RPM Firewire 400 drive it was noticabely slower, but still acceptable: a large folder copied to LaCie in 28 secs., vs. 36 for the WD.It IS noisy. You can clearly hear it working, it's louder than any of my other external drives and when going to sleep, it makes a horrible LOUD clicking sound. The case feels cheap, but looks OK stashed away in the corner of my desk...All in all, for the price it's a really fine product."
2,Slows Vista Boot Times,Avoid this product if you are running Vista. When My Book is attached to my computer it adds about 2 minutes to Vista's boot time. Others have reported the same problem. Western Digital's has yet to acknowledge the problem. The product does not seem to have a negative impact on XP's performance.
1,One Year Warranty!!!,"I have a 500gig Essential that died after 15 months. I had no idea when I bought it that this only has a one year warranty. I've never heard of ANY harddrive with less than three years. With only one year, this is absolutely not worth the money. I've bought a number of Western Digital drives and have found them to be less and less reliable. As it turns out, this will be my last!!"
3,Not Mobile,"Here is my only complaint. The drive is indeed easily set up on most computers (plug it in and it's good) however the power cord and physical size make this fairly unwieldy. You will groan each time you have to yank the power cord and brick out of the wall to move it to a different computer or travel. For me, it wasn't worth it to put up with this when similar storage-size USB powered drives that are half the size and 1/3 the weight are available and require no power cord.If you plan to leave it on one desk and not move it much then it should be fine! It does work well and is speedy."
4,"Big Drive, Small Size","I bought 2 of these drives to backup digital photos that would no longer fit on my hard drive. I keep the same thing on both of them, just in case one crashes. So far I have had no problems. Plus the Google Picasa2 software that comes on the drives is nice for sorting all of my photos in an easy to view way. The drives are also pretty small and fit nicely on a small shelf beside my computer. They are also pretty quite while running, unlike some of WD's previous drives. If you need extra space, in a compact place, this is a good choice."
3,Is there a decent external hard drive out there????,"I bought this after the Simpletech failed. This one works on my laptop without any problems. On my desktop, it works only when it feels like working. I am having a hard time getting a drive the will work consistently. To anyone that wants to buy these, I would suggest that get one that you can return without penelty. That way, if you try it out and have to return it, it won't cost you anything......."
4,My Book is a nice product,"Couldn't be easier to install and use. Even my mother can use it.Plug and play just as advertised. No CDs or discs containing software to install. It's all embedded in the drive itself, meaning you can utilize My Book with multiple computers without needing to carry any installation software.I'll be buying more...Each My Book can sit in the bookshelf fulfilling my multiple data storage needs.Nice product"
2,not happy,I bought this drive and used it for about two weeks before it crashed and I lost all of my work. I have a few friends that have owned WT products before and they also have had problems with them. I cannot reccomend this drive
1,Mine doesn't work,I have this unit and the drive randomly turns on and off in the middle of writing to it. Not recommended!
5,If you Plan to Use this with both Mac and Windows Machines...,".... Leave it formatted as a FAT32 disk. Though Macs can read an NTFS file, they can not write to it.I find this to be an extremely effective way of transferring files between computers, able to handle extremely large files. Really you are only limited by the speed of the USB 2.0 connection (which is not all that slow).I agree with the other positive reviews here, it is a fine piece of hardware for the money. Quiet, good looking, and ergonomically simple. Really can't go wrong with this."
5,Does what it says,"Setup was easy, plugged it and I was done. Transferring files are done quick enough and the hard drive goes into a sleep mode when not used within a given amount of time. If sending a file to the hard drive when in sleep mode, it starts up and is ready in about 5 seconds. I'm happy with my purchase and will update if anything goes wrong.One thing that bothers me somewhat is the amount of different sounds the drive makes. The sounds aren't exactly consistent, which worries me a bit. The sounds are quiet though, just the humming and ticking of a normal hard drive, but why the range? Is it trying to be a musical instrument?"
5,Very Satisified,"We recently bought these for storing additional data on workstations at my place of business. They have worked wonderfully and with a very small footprint take up very little space when space is an issue. Fast data transfer, virtually silent operation, and virtually non-existant heat generation, great product.Only few cons is the ""utilities"" that come pre-installed are not needed for business users and its an older version of Adobe Reader than is currently available, but those are hardly worth deducting a star.All in all these have been wonderful, will definetly consider WD products in the future."
5,Great drive,Had it for over a year now and it's performed flawlessly. Nice and quiet. I plugged and I played. I'm a big fan of Western Digital now. I've also owned their super fast Raptor HD for over 3 years and it's still going strong.
2,Worst customer service,"My my book crashed within a few months. The customer service never picks up the phone. It just keeps ringing. The enclosure is sealed so I can't check open it unless I want to void the warranty, which I will do tommorrow.If you buy this product just keep your fingers crossed that you will never need customer support. Warranty is meaningless."
4,I'm Glad I Did Not Read the Reviews Before Buying This,"I've had two My Books for over a year. I use one for backing up and one to keep my media files tidy and in one place. I had no idea that everyone was having so many problems. I run XP home edition with service pack two. I reformatted the units to NTFS. I have not had any damage to my systems by shutting down the computer with My Book still powered up and I have not found it to run slow, but I don't have cutting edge computer hardware any more-- I typing this on an hp purchased in 2001 that still gives good service.The main problem? These large external drives discourage me from ever deleting a file. I'm enough of a packrat at it is and I don't need any encouragement to be a digital packrat as well. Heck, I even went through the 3.5 disks I have and copied the contents to the hard drive. I wonder where I could find a 5.25 drive? I know I have an old box of floppies around here with some DOS games on them."
5,Changed my life,"This was one of the first books that I purchased by Dr. Stanley. I read this book many, many, many years ago. Then I was lead by the Holy Spirit to buy more and give them to friends. The individuals that were blessed by this book said that this book changed their prayer life so tremendously. I try to keep one extra on hand just to bless someone else."
5,We NEED More of This Kind of Fresh Artistry,"Being a musician myself, I have followed the likes of Pat Metheny (a very nice guy too!), for decades. When Nando Lauria performed with Metheny, a new feel was created. In addition to this work, and Novo Brasil, as well as his other Narada works, you HAVE to hear Lauria on the the Narada Christmas Collection doing Gloria. The harmonies are incredible and will give you chills. Too bad its the groups like N'SYNC and Brittney Spears that get all the hype. Sheesh.Tis the season... cheers!"
1,GWB-4000 System,"Nothing but problems. The first transmitter was defective. The manufacturer was non-responsive. The replacement transmitter worked but the quality of the video was unacceptable (very blurry) and the transmitter-receiver link was inconsistent, even after trying all the frequency combinations. This product should be removed from the inventory.Ultimate Wireless Dos/linux/macmsd/pwr/95/98/w2k/wme/nt Grandtech"
3,Difficult to use,I have two other types of small SD MP3 players and this one was the only one that gave me trouble in getting it to work. I am going to stick with the MyMusix from now on.
4,Background Info provides new outlook,"This book is basically a tie-in of the first few episodes of the hit show, The O.C., having been a big fan of the show, I picked up the book for the heck of it to read it. And it actually turned out to be pretty good, you find out a lot of background information and it gives you kind of a new outlook on all the characters. And since there's only so much TV can get across, the book helps to convey what's going on in the character's minds.My only gripe with the book is that the author gets a little repetitive. In the first chapter he mentions Ryan and Theresa having been best friends since they were kids twice in the span of 2 pages, and there are other occasions where he does get repetitive, but other than that it was a good read and I recommend it to fans of the show, or maybe even anyone who hasn't seen the show!"
2,Neh.,"It was a pretty crappy novelization if you ask me. First of all, it was based on a whole load of episodes but ended up coming at about, what, 200 pages? and the price is pretty steep for a short book. I think the author needs to write out the characters better. It seems like they only read scripts and didn't really know the characters. Watch the show, don't bother buying the books."
3,Not brilliant but not bad!,"I bought ""The O.C."" book ""The Outsider"" after watching the series for a while.I'm glad I bought it because I never really understood why Ryan Atwood lived in the Cohen's house. The book explains all of this and it's good that you are able to see what is going on in the characters minds. I really got to know the characters much better. BUT, it is very badly written with a lot of repitition and not great descriptions. Read this book if you want to discover the background of the characters but DO NOT read this if you want to read a well written novel!("",)"
4,hooked on it,"omg! at first I thought I was gonna not like the book but it is soooo good! It's basiclly about a guy from Chino who doesn't really have a good family or lifestyle. On day he and his brother steal a car and he goes to juvie. He meets this rich lawyer, who says if he needs anything hes there for him. Well it turns out he does when his mom abandons him. He goes to live with the lawyer and his family in the O.C.. They have a huge mansion, he lives in a trailer. They attended a rich private school, he goes to a low ranked public school. They have visas out the ying yang he has - if hes lucky- a couple dollars. They have the world in the palm of their hands, he has nothing. Now he must learn to live with this family and get along with these rich people. Life in the O.C. is not how he planned it to be. It is a definate good summer read, I read it in one day! I recomend it."
5,Can't stop listening!!,This is a GREAT CD! Every track is tightly written. The guitar riffs are amazing and strong. I am a new fan of Sevendust since Animosity was released. I will be hyping up this cd for some time to come. If you don't have it. What are you waiting for!!!
4,"Cool Tunes, but not Animosity","Seasons is a good album and shows again that Sevendust can rock with the best of them. However, dispite its power of good lyrics and great melodic balance, it seems to lack the appeal of Animosity. Overall, it is a good cd and Sevendust fans will not br disappointed!PS. Fans should also check out Sevendust's single on the Freddy vs. Jason soundtrack!"
5,Seasons,"All I can say is that it's a pretty good album. I had originally said there was no rapping, but then I listened to Enemy and realised how wrong I was.Anyway yeah, it's a good album. This is really just a half-assed review to supply the 5 stars but that's all there is to say. There isn't any defining characteristics Sevendust have that separate them from the rest, it's just a good CD.Of course every band has their own unique sound, admit it or not, I like sevendust's sound and my favourite song is Broken Down. Good nu-metal CD."
4,Step backwards from animosity,"This album is really good and it has maybe 7 or 8 good songs on it, the bonus DVD is a nice addition. But it is not as good as animosity. The sound on this album is too light. the guitars don't have enough meat in them. listen to ""redefine"" from animosity, the chorus. it has a nice sound. the sound here is not like that. there's no low mids. and none of the songs really hit you like T.O.A.B. or Trust or Shine or Black or the songs from Home. For the first time, I find Morgan's drumming annoying, I really want the snare to sound different. On the bright side, clint's backup vocals are good as usual, especially ""Skeleton Song."" And Enemy, Seasons, Broken Down, Burned Out, and Gone are great songs."
1,-1000000000000000000000000 stars!!!!!!!,seven dust stinks like poop! i hate them i hope they break up and that new song enbemy about Dez fomr coal chamber/devildriver i hate that song they suck i donmt see devildriver making a song about u kno who (not saying n e names here) 7ducks are a bunch of lil jr babys
4,Not Bad,"This CD is pretty much what you would expect the follow-up to Animosity to sound like. It is their most melodic album to date, but by no means are they selling out here. There are still some heavy songs on here and it is still pure Sevendust."
5,This album dominates,"I must admit LJ's voice did it for me on this one. This guy has talent. Enemy and Broken Down are my two favorite tracks on this album. I have all of Sevendust's albums and this is their best work. If you're more into melodic beats with plenty of heavy guitar riffs this is the album for you. LJ really lets loose on the song Disgrace. He puts a lot of emotion into his songs, thats one thing i like about this album. Forget all this talk about nu-metal this and nu-metal that. They have a style of their own and that's all i gotta say....."
4,THE BEST NU METAL BAND OUT THERE!!!!!!!,this isn't the best by sevendust or the heaviest but it is an awesome cd by and amazing band.if you a new comer to sevendust i would suggest getting home or sevendust first. I also agree with TensionExperiment if you are a true fan of good music or sevendust or hard rock then you'll see that they still kick A** they just changed a few things
2,Wake me when it's over,There is absolutely nothing about this disc that makes me want to listen to it again. This is definitely not up to the standard that Sevendust has set for themselves with their previous efforts.
5,Screw this.,"Get it at target. Its only 9 dollars and no shipping. Save 3 dollars, I dont think so amazon. I bet this gets deleted but for the ones that see it. TARGET RULES."
2,(2.5 Stars) Barely Decent,"Sevendust have been around for a few years and are one of the hardest working bands in the scene today. Unfortunatly they've never acheived mainstream success and have had to watch much less talented acts such as Staind and others who used to open for them become millionares. So what do they do about it? They make an ultra mainstream record. While on the first or second listen, Seasons is good enough, it gets old extremly fast and lacks the timeless quality other albums had. This is a record entirely comprised of singles. Which means it gets extremely irriatating and cloying after a week or two. Not the worst album ever but dosen't deserve much more than a listen or two every couple of months."
2,ehhhh,"These guys have done a lot better. Apparently they all went sober and decided to write an even more mainstream album than before, but everything just feels too polished and mediocre. I have to admit, I used to love nu metal but since then I've matured musically and my tastes aren't really the same. The Deftones Adrenaline is the closest thing to a nu metal album that I'll listen to. Sevendust where great on the s/t and Home, but here they just sound tired and kinda waiting to die. The song Enemy is really dumb too. I wonder if they're either pissed at him for treating Morgan's ugly wife Rayna like crap, or because he's actually in a much more serious and real metal band, Devildriver.Check out Killswitch Engage instead. Lajon wishes he could sing like Howard Jones."
1,1 1/2 stars...weak,"I was only able to find 2 songs on this album that I could enjoy at all. This is their weakest album yet. Theres nothing on here that's too heavy, melodic, or original. It's nothing but dull and recycled guitar riffs and drum beats this time around. Here I thought they were progressing when Animosity overpowered Home but I was just plain wrong. Bad job guys, and I couldn't care less what any hardcore Sevendust fan that's just happy that their band is still making music has to think about my opinion on this. Just face it, soon you'll realize after a few more listens that this album just plain sucks."
1,just another mainstream band,"if u want to know what this album sounds like just go listen to their first one, or the second one or even the third one. why?? cuz they all sound the freakin same. these guys got about as much musical talent and creativity as britney spears. the music is great but im sick of hearing the same song 40 times. dont waste ur money, or just buy one of their albums and u got all 4!!! pathetic, pathetic, pathetic"
3,what happened?!,"i think sevendust has gotten kidna soft...the stuff that they are putting out can't touch their song ""Black""...i could tell with Anitmosity that they were gonna start making more melodic songs...it's an ok cd but i like the older cd's better...i did catch them on their animosity tour @ the tabernacle in atlanta a few years back and they do put on one hell of a show...one thing hasn't changed, and that's the passion in the music..."
3,not their greatest but still good,"seasons was the first cd from them that i got and even though its not my favorite i liked it enough to buy all sevendust's other cds. enemy was the first song by sevendust that i heard and i loved it. overall it isnt as heavy as the others but the songs still manage to keep me listening. i think lajon's voice is at its prime on this cd and he yells less which i think is better cause he can sing good. my favorite songs are enemy, broken down, seperate, and face to face. the others are ok but not sevendust's best work"
3,Ehhhh...so-so,Animosity is the best 7dust ever. This one seems to be trying to be like it to much. Some catchy songs but not there best effort!
4,Perfect starting point for anyone who is new to 7dust,"This is Sevendust at their most melodic. Some people might fight me on that. But they have kept the screaming to a minimum this time and focused more on Lajon's singing. Butch Walker's production has made for a solid, more focused, radio friendly feel. This is a perfect starting point for anyone who is new to Sevendust."
2,seasons change and so have sevendust...,"i have a lot of respect for sevendust and i own all of their cd's too but i can't say that i like where they are going...the songs in this cd each start off raw and hard but then is unfortunately laced with a melodic chorus...it just doesn't fly too well with me...the sevendust that i like are songs like ""black""...i caught their animosity show at the tabernacle in atlanta and they can put on a show but i just dont feel it with this one...yeah i can see how everyone says that they've matured with this album and i guess i just haven't..."
2,WTF?,i am sorry but i am glad they got a new guitarist their new albums NEXT is good but this album sucked it wasn't heavy and didn't sound like sevendustpersonally i was diappointed
3,Not as good as the old stuff,"Seasons is not even close the gut wrenching, heavy guitar, and lyrics that the past cd's have. I tried giving it a chance for a week and I think its a pathetic excuse for a cd from a metal band. Boy bands are trash and Coal Chamber sucks."
4,Considerable Follow up 4.5 stars,"Follwing up on 2001's animosity sevendust take even more of a mellow approach. Like animosity, but far more into ballad/anthem meterial. Not bad at all, and certainly matured, and evolved a complete 180 degree turn from there abbraisive, ultra hard rocking debut. Altough fans of the first two album will most certainly not like this album, for real fans it's another album, more compasionate, emotional."
3,A good introductory book,It is a good introductory book that gives explanations about basic concepts and some good and simple recommendations. I found the explanations in the beginning about basic Hindu concepts very vague and simplistic
2,Find something else,"I know most people are required to buy this for teacher training, but it's such a poorly written book. It would work so much better with some charts or grafts and clearer definitions. I wouldn't buy it again, and I definitely don't recommend it."
4,A little more advanced than I thought,The book starts off with a whole lot of information and not a whole lot of explanation. Not the best book to start with on your Ayurveda journey but definitely useful.
3,"Nothing new, and nothing deep in this book","The problem I have with Ayurveda is that based on the body type descriptions I don't fit into any of the categories. Until one can diagnose which body type one is, the rest of the information is not very useful. All the treatments are type specific.In the 1980's I read a lot of Depak Chopra and that was the problem I had with his books as well. If you teach yoga this book will give you enough background info to field basic questions about Ayurveda."
5,Quiet Empowerment: A Family Woman's Journey,"The writing is brilliant--I couldn't put the book down. What a picture it gives of a busy and caring life within an international context. And how much of that life was submergedfor years, until the author's work was done, raising a wonderful family.I love the poetic vignettes. The photographs contribute images that complement the text. What a loving and dutiful wife, mother, daughter-in-law! An elegant restraint makes the few, critical passages (the mild outburst over the instant mashed potatoes for Mothers' Day!) more telling. And the quiet wisdom in finding solutions, like the second potatopeeler for her husband. Tiberghien's story of achieving a successful marriage is the sturdy subtext of this memoir. I admire the work unreservedly."
3,A Non-Christian's First Gospel Record,"I've always really appreciated the energy of a good gospel choir, but this my first whole album of it, and coming from musical, secular perspective, it's a pretty good album. Tons of energy and emotion, but i can't say i'd ever put this on over a great soul record. The highlights, for me, of a great soul record are often when the artist can't help but sing their hearts out. Shakin the Rafters is an entire album of that, and, for me, it gets tiring. Even the ballads seem too on the nose. The highlights, for me, of this record are purely musical and emotional. I know this is a ridiculous comment for a gospel record, but take out the preaching and i'd probably put this on regular rotation."
2,What's the Fuss?,"I bought this after being intrigued by Tom Waits' comment that Shakin' the Rafters is the greatest rock and roll record of all time. If that's why you are checking it out, forget it because there is very little rock and roll here.I knew this CD was going to be gospel music when I ordered it and some gospel really rocks, but after hearing this I could not imagine what the fuss is about. The music, particularly the keyboards, is very weak and the singing, while inspired, is amateurish. There is a lot better gospel music to listen to on the market than this.Celebrity endorsements aren't any better than anyone else's, but I took a chance on Waits' assessment of this CD since his tastes in music are famously eclectic and mine are as well. Looks like I lost my bet here, I won't be playing this one much. If you buy this, you should do so for the message, but certainly not for the music."
3,Last Stand,"Released in 1992, Method to the Madness was the final studio album from Canadian rockers Killer Dwarfs. On this album, the band continued their Ratt meets Quiet Riot party metal style, with a bit more emphasis on power ballads and melodies, perhaps in hopes of capitalizing on the Steelheart/Firehouse/Slaughter power ballad trend going on at the time. The result is a slightly more commercial Killer Dwarfs album.Unfortunately for the band, there was another musical trend waiting in the wings. Method to the Madness was released just as a sea of flannel clad grunge bands was taking over radio and MTV, all but eliminating the ""hair metal"" genre. It's not all that surprising that Killer Dwarfs would call it a day soon after the album's release.Method to the Madness is hardly original, but it remains a fun album from a fun band, and is likely to please most hair metal/80's rock fans."
4,No Problems,"+Pretty+Works as advertised.-No fan, but doesn't seem to really get hot.-Have to take out 4 screws to change the drive. Recommended for semi-permanent installations.?Never spins down the drive, however, I'm not sure if that is cause of the computer or enclosure."
5,"I was skeptical, but this product is AWESOME!! 5 Stars all the way","I really needed to find a drive enclosure that would not require me to reformat the hard drive. I had important files I needed to keep and had already tried one product but when I found out I would have to reformat I turned to Amazon reviews for a solution. Everything that the others have written about the Kingston drive enclosure is ""spot on"". It's super easy. It's very fast. There is NO need to reformat the hard drive. You'll SAVE your data. And yes, the lights are kinda bright but who cares? This thing WORKS. And it's very affordable. I highly recommend it. I'm buying my second one right now."
1,"my HDD didn't fit (NOTE: Correction, it DID fit after all!)","I would have thought my Seagate 100 GB Barracuda ATA hard drive (ST310011A-RL) is a ""standard"" 3.5"" HD, and so would fit in this enclosure, but it doesn't. The enclosure cover can not slide back into place because it gets hung up on the middle set of screws on the hard drive. So, if you are wanting to use a Seagate because you like that 5 year warranty, here is a caution that it might not fit!CORRECTION: Five (5) stars after all! Sorry, my mistake. Before returning the enclosure, I tried again. This time the cover slid closed just fine, apparently I had not seated the drive in the enclosure properly. So, the external hard disk drive I created using this enclosure with the Seagate internal drive has worked out great. Orange and blue bubble lights: I know they bug some people, and I'm not a Bronco's fan, but I don't mind these, they are weirdly interesting."
4,Making use of old hard drives,The Kingwin USB hard drive enclosure provides an easy method to extend the life of a hard drive from an old computer. The hardest part of using this enclosure was determining how to open the case. Once open the installation of the old hard drive was a breeze and worked perfectly after plugging into a USB 2.0 port. You can recover files from the old drive and then use it as a backup on your new computer. Excellent product.
5,"Works as advertised, lights no prob","Received the unit per committed ship dates and as already stated by others, the thing just works and is easy to get going. Installed an already formatted 3.5"" IDE 150Gb h/d drive from old, dead system, with data on it, and within 5 mins I was accessing my data from Win XP Media Ctr PC. Saved my bacon because the new system I'd bought was ATA only with no other way to retrieve the valuable data on the drive. If you don't care for the lights you can obscure one by turning the drive on it's side (with accompanying mounts), but my 13 yr old thought the blue/orange lights were cool -- also great if you're Denver/Boise State Broncos fan."
3,"Covers a number of words, but the definitions prejudiced","This book covers many KJV words which are currently used but their meanings are changed. I wanted to know KJV in the positive way through this book. But, when I began to read this book, this book disappointed me. Because, the cover of this book said this book would give you clear understanding on the KJV, but through the contents of the book the author praised RSV or ASV. I think RSV is also a good translation, but, if the author prefers RSV to KJV, he must be sincere to choose the title of the book."
2,too simplified,"I wanted it to be words in the King James Bible that I don't use everyday (like furlong), but it was mostly simple terms."
1,Easy Wheels not easy without the hardware,"I had to return the Easy Wheels cart because the hardware was not complete.However, I was able to order Easy Wheels from our local hardware store, andthe package came with all of the hardware. With all of the hardware, the productis excellent. Without all of the hardware, you can't assemble it. Simple as that."
2,MISSING PARTS!!!!,The item arrived missing the rear axle!!! It was a birthday gift that we couldn't put together because of the missing part!! It looks like a great product but very disappointing to give something as a gift that is missing the main part that makes it work!! Drat!!!
2,Smelly Cart,"I ordered the chart a few months ago. The first thing I noticed was that my new chart didn't come with any instructions, so I pulled up a couple pictures online and managed to complete the assembly. Then I noticed a strong smell coming from the wheels of the chart, it smelled like Dr. Tichenors Antiseptic, so I put the chart outside for a couple days to let it air out. Unfortunate, two months later, the chart still has the strong smell associated with it. The smell is so bad that we leave it outside when it's not being used. I'm not sure if I received a defected chart, but I'm not very happy with the product."
1,False Advertising!!!,Seller advertises package of 2 carts for the price listed. Seller only sent 1 cart and did not respond to emails regarding this issue.
3,Not worth the money,"With shipping, I paid over $50 for this cart and while that's not a tremendous amount, I'd still expect decent quality for it, considering that the cheapies from Target cost about half that price. The only good things about this cart are its size and the fact that the wheels are metal and rubber rather than plastic. That said, the design is pretty lousy. After putting together the cart according to the minimal instructions, I took it out for a test run. Luckily, I was just returning from the supermarket when one of pins securing the wheels to the axle--more or less a bobby pin--fell out and a wheel came off. By bending the securing pins with pliers to lock them in place, I've managed to rig it so that the cart functions again, but who knows how long it will last..."
4,"Good, sturdy, a bit akward","A nice cart and lots of room for shopping or (best) farmer's markets. With so much room, it's hard to squash your veggies. Puts together fast, but I was missing one washer. It would be nice to have this sold with a liner, but it is easy to find liners that fit it."
3,Efficient but bad manoeverability,"Good capacity , good in storage, but without rotator front wheels it poses a problem when manoevering curves - you ll have to tilt the cart towards the handle in order to turn.Reliable though."
5,Great Cart,"The Narita Trading NTC001-RD Jumbo Shopping Cart is one of the handiest things I own. I just passed my 70th birthday, and the cart makes play out of the used-to-be arduous task of hauling a large order of groceries from our car in the garage, down the driveway, across the patio, into our kitchen; and it folds up neatly out of the way when it's not being used. I have another of these carts that I have used for that task for several years, and its job now, with a plastic trash can inside, is to carry as much as 100 pounds of firewood per trip from our patio to the fireplace in our den. Great product."
1,Defective item,"I wanted to give NO stars for the cart, but Amazon doesn't have that rating. The cart arrived very fast; unfortunately, it arrived in a seriously defective and unusable state. On the rear axle, the inner cotter pin holes were misplaced allowing only enough room to use one, not both; also, both rear wheels were impaired, with one seriously warped in both spokes and rubber. The packaging was minimal and not enough to protect the item.3 stars to TrueValue - they responded immediately and promised to refund my purchase without return, but now I have to reorder it. It would have been nicer if they had just sent me another. Because of this experience, I will be using another vendor and it will take much longer to get, but hopefully it will arrive in good order."
3,"I like it, but.....","This cart is very capacious and easily brought six bags of groceries into the house from the car. However, it is not as easily maneuverable as it could be because the smaller wheels don't swivel. This could be helpful when I would like to push the cart in front of me rather than pull it behind."
2,Black Jumbo Shopping Cart,"Item came shrink wrapped and was defective. I would not buy it again from the store that Amazon partnered with since although they gave me my money back for it. It was a real hassle since the store first wanted me to try and return it, but would not give me a box to put it in. They told me their carrier,FedeX Ground would supply a box but that was untrue. Fedex will not take items without a box. Then they told me to tie up the item and give it to Fedex, but Fedex refused as they do not pick up items that are not in a box. This proved to be a very big problem and caused me much aggravation."
4,Does not come assembled,"Mine didn't come pre-assembled. Maybe I didn't research the product well enough. Just a heads up, so you don't have a big wheel fall and pound on your cable box, too."
5,Editor in Chief A1,"A friend introduced these books to me. Had to have them. We use them along side our other curriculum to help build our writing skills by looking for ""error's"". Paragraphs are short and the ""hunt"" can be lots of fun."
2,Not the best selection.,"I was expecting to get a collection of early Betty Boop cartoons but found this did not have many of these. No ""Snow White,"" or ""Bimbo's Initiation"" for example. I have the VHS set ""Betty Boop - The Definitive Collection"" and wish something like that could be put out on DVD. The Complete Fleischer Popeye is available from WB on 8 discs in three sets. When will the same be done with BB?"
4,"Betty Boop, a few greats and a lot of dross","Classic Betty Boop Cartoons, Vol. 1I was a little disappointed, but I suppose it is too much to hope for all the great Betty Boops on one disk.Mary DeForest"
5,A Life of Picasso Book 1,"This Book is very interesting. It is detailed about Picasso and his life (until the age of 25), his influences and best of all a lot of information about his paintings. There are a lot of black and white pictures of his work as well as the paintings that directly influenced a particular work. There is also a fair amount of gossipy information about Picasso and his poet and painter peers, girlfriends and especially excerpts from letters that allow you to get inside his mind. It is quite enjoyable. Now on to book 2."
1,Rimage Has Poor After-Sales Service,"Rimage has poor after sales service. If you're buying this product be prepared to fend for yourself.Their distributor in Miami, Brooke, would say anything to close the sale but once your money is in their pocket, the distributor would tell you to go to Rimage directly for support and Rimage would give you a runaround.The product worked pretty well at the start but as soon as I needed support - and believe me, you will need support too - they began the run around.As a matter of disclosure, I work for a Trinidad news company ([...]) which in no way competes with Rimage or Brooke. I have my receipt and of course the machine to prove ownership.One more thing, be prepared to get the run around just about until the warranty expires.That's my advice. Take it or leave it. It's your money."
2,Great...when it works...,"We've had two of these things running off Windows XP boxes and it's been a love/hate relationship. All the previous posters were right; support sucks...and you will need it. The Quickdisk program crashes more than any other software I've ever used. I frequently have to shut everything down and reboot. It doesn't like copying from burned year+ old burned DVD disks, chokes on CDs frequently, and has trouble picking up the disks. Lots of Rejected burns within a burn session, too. However, when it works it's great. The prints are very nice and it can be a huge time saver."
5,Tingles,This stuff makes your head tingle. It's delightful. Very happy with the product and the shampoo is awesome too. Thanks.
5,Cheap!,"Bought this for 4 bucks, because it was an older edition. Found out it has the same information as the newer edition. The lesson of this story is... Don't buy new editions!"
4,D Hearns,"This book is a good source for astronomy information. However, like most textbooks, it's very pricey."
1,"No page numbers. Read page 200-220, where is that? How do i get there?","At first glance this book is fine. It has embedded links and all the content. However, the BIGGEST issue I have is that there is no easy way to navigate to specific places in the book. Yes you can click on the index to go to a chapter. But you cannot go to specific pages within the chapter. So when my instructor says read pages 145-287 how the heck am I supposed to know where in the book that is? I have to ask, what chapter is that in? and then whats the sentence it starts with and ends with and manually skim over the chapter until i find the page. If anyone is going to school online and working full time you know that you don't have time to search for what you should be reading. ADD PAGE NUMBERS! and an option in the Go To section to 'go to' a specific page just like in the REAL 8th edition. Until you add pages I give this product a 1 for being a pain since I can't return it and just get the physical copy."
1,Gave as a gift.,Never heard much back. Not sure it the receiver liked it or not. But not up my alley. That's for sure.
2,boston pops orchestra,"I have tried, I really have to appreciate the BOSTON POPS .... but they are so bland, Fielder, williams, and this keith person.. can't just one of these conductors put some orignality in their recordings?Andre Kostalantz sounds actually better which is a stretch. If you like Franck Pourcel, James Last, Paul Muriat, Raymond Lefevre,you will be solely disappoined with the Pops"
3,Wanted to like it more,"I really wanted to like this. I enjoy different interpretations of the ""standards"". I think, however, to celebrate Sinatra, this collection misses the sass and style of my favorite singer! The orchestra does a nice job with the arrangements, but they are more vanilla-flavored Sinatra. Not a bad thing, but not what I expected...more of an Andy Williams type of tribute with Sinatra classic songs...if that makes sense to you.A different Sinatra portrait (from here at Amazon) that I enjoy much more is by the Oscar Peterson Trio:A Jazz Portrait of Frank SinatraListen to the samples on that one...I think you'll like it!"
2,Two stars for effort,"I love Sinatra, but this cd si more insult than tribute, sorry to say. Let's find out why...Could it be that this band is better at playing marches, classical music, and Broadway stuff? Huh I think I hit the nail on the head. Looks like we've got ourselves a two sided sword here, on one side of the sword we have a band that is too large and klunky to paly those Nelson Rissle style Sinatra arrangemets. On the other side of the sword we have a band that has no personality.What could have been done differently?A abnd liek Marty Paich or Billy May could pull off a Ole Blue eyes tribute or even ole Harru Connick Jr, but not the pops,s-o-r-r-y. I'll give it 2 stars for effort, and for remebering Sinatra."
5,Big Boy Returns,"If you live in Canada, and love BigBoy... u may have already noticed how hard it is to find BigBoy in any music stores now, which bites. Even if you DONT LIKE RAP... believe me, you'll like BigBoy... My favorite song out of them all is Sin Tu Amor feat. Angel from Son By Four. BigBoy makes great music and has no use for vulgar language, which is pretty hard to find now a days in so much music. Buy it even if you dont understand Spanish, its worth. I had to order this CD cause where I live they dont get the bigboy cd's in anymore :-( BUT it IS WORTH THE MONEY to have ordered in!"
5,Don't miss this production!,"Believe me, Big Boy has done so many albums and is really one of the only artists who travel worldwide to spread ""reggaeton"" to other countries. He even does concerts in England! He was recently nominated for a ""Premios Lo Nuestro"" award as best latin rapper. He raps with much skill w/o having to curse or talk ""demasiado vulgarmente"". I recommend this production to all latin music lovers! My favorite songs are:Juramelo: A big hit in Puerto Rico! Catchy chorus!I'm sorry! Since the songs dont have samples I forgot the other songs I loved! But I remember they were very popular in PR! Trust me .Buy it!"
3,Farewell Read,"The book was there. Black letters on a red cover as red as blood. I wanted to impresss the dame next to me. She had curves in all the right places. I wanted her to know that I was the kind of a real man that read Spillane. I got the book and headed to the check out desk. She looked me over. Never saw her again. Read the book as a goodbye to Mickey. Not a real good memory. Mike gets shot and hurts the whole book. Gets the bad guys, but plot isn't too interesting. So long, Mike."
2,Ray King got it right,"Another reviewer said ""The story starts with him gut shot and for the rest of the book, he hobbles around. Where the Mike of old would have performed surgery on himself, reloaded the bullet and shot someone with it, this Hammer keeps going to the doctor and complaining""This is completely perfect. I don't WANT my heros eating a soft boiled egg because they hurt from too much stress. That's not why I picked up this novel.The mystery itself (missing money, who murdered his buddy) is not very interesting, and drags. Ah, Hammer."
2,A very poor outing by a previously dynamite author.,"In my opinion this does not even come close to the Spillane classics, Kiss Me Deadly, I the Jury, My gun is quick. This is not the same old Hammer and the plot is definitely not up to Spillane's previous works. The plot is shallow, the characters are transparent and he should give up now before he embarrasses himself further. I bought the hardcover (never again) and when finished, gave it away."
1,"Long in the tooth, short in the action, this Hammer doesn't","I've read and enjoyed Spillane for 35 years but his latest work is a major disappointment. Spillane's Hammer has aged along with Spillane with the result that he is more like Barnaby Jones than the Hammer of old. He talks about his buddies from the ""War"" and the way he talks (and acts), you realize it is WWII.The story starts with him gut shot and for the rest of the book, he hobbles around. Where the Mike of old would have performed surgery on himself, reloaded the bullet and shot someone with it, this Hammer keeps going to the doctor and complaining. He gets engaged to Velda, she's more than willing, and he does nothing about it. Enough said? Like Agatha Christie, Alistair MacLean and others, age seems to have sapped Spillane's talents. My advice is to skip this book, find some vintage Spillane and enjoy the ride."
1,Do the math,"I grew up on Mike Hammer. I can still hear some of the dialogue, written in the fifties, echoing through the halls of memory. Mike Hammer, his friend Pat Chambers and the drop-dead gorgeous Velda were all products of the second world war era. To have them bridging the gap between the forties and the nineties as if the two time periods were contemporaneous is a jarring experience. No amount of suspension of disbelief will allow for that. It's as if Spillane took the cash advance and phoned in the manuscript. My gut feeling is that he merely dusted off an old plot line from some unpublished work prior work, updated the technology and sent it in as a new story. I nearly choked when Hammer and Velda discussed the possibility of starting a family. Viagra can only do so much."
1,costume,"The costume arrived quickly, but it did not look like the picture. It was a different color and very poor quality. I was really disappointed."
5,Another great season,"This is another great year of ER, the goodbye of Dr. Greene leads to the building of Dr. Carter becoming the leader of the emergency room. Also they build on younger characters like Abby, Pratt and the foundation for the show now starts, great season!"
5,Amazon and ER DVD's,"The ER DVD's....what can I say?? This excellent, excellent series seems to keep getting better every year, despite the loss of prominent characters. Thanks, Amazon, for putting these out as soon as they're available and for the fast shipping you always handle so well!"
5,Another Great Season,"This season was great, only one more to watch before a long wait for season 10."
3,Glory Days Over,"This was a watchable season, mainly for the farewaell to Anthony Edwards' character of Dr. Mark Green. Other than that, the season was too often a reminder of just how good the show HAD been. Later characters in the series lacked the same chemistry of the first five years and although you rooted for them to get it right, they never seemed to get the same magical mix they had the first five years of the show. So, although an okay season and still better than lots of other television, it was not the ER I had loved or remembered and was actually the last year I watched the show."
2,last disc is blank!!!!,"I was very disappointed when I got to the final disc on ER Season 8, and come to find out that it was blank!!! It wouldn't play on our DVD. We tried every DVD in the house and ....nothing! What is going on? I then come to find out one of my friends also experience the same problem with her ER Season 8 DVD. Anyone else experiencing the same problem?"
1,ER season 8,"I have another bad experience with this series. Before buying this season, I read the properties where they said that this subtitled in French and Spanish and is not true. It is only subtitled in English.Please be more honest with consumers because it also costs us money"
5,Er # 1,"My daugther is 14 years old and has multiple disabilities. She LOVES ER, she has most of the ER Seasons on Dvd. She cant wait to get her 9th Season. She would love meet the cast..."
5,Great,Got this as a gift. Great price and so much easier to buy online than going to the store. Thanks
3,Electric Guitar,"Only problem is the handle that needed to be screwed in wouldn't go in, so we didn't put it on. That was the only quality problem. Other than that, everything else is great."
4,Great guitar,"I bought this guitar for my stepson, who decided that he wanted to learn howto play. I originally picked this one because of the price, but the quality is top notch. The guitar and the amp both have great sound, overall a greatpurchase"
4,Purity of Sound,"There are few voices that are ""pure,"" and few songs that exhibit such purity. I'm reminded of ""My Girl"" by the Temptations as one of those combinations of purity. In this album, Paul Robeson captured purity a couple of times. You know the songs. You heard them as a kid. They are part of our culture, part of our humanity, reflective of a difficult time, and they remind us of how far we have come and how far we have yet to go.Robeson's voice is rich, pure, and resonant. The only fear I had (a fear I have with the digitization of any old recording) was the quality of the CD. Have no fear--it's crystal clear.Why not 5 stars? It's a personal preference: I would have liked to have swapped out a few songs for some others. Still, a majority of the songs are just wonderful...pure."
3,"His best album is ""Ol' Man River"", this one is ok","His best album is ""Ol' Man River"", this one is ok, and has some good songs not on Ol Man River. Paul Robeson is one of the greatest singers of all time. His best songs include Shenandoah, Just a wearyin for you, water boy, deep river, joshua fit the battle of jericho. Other good songs include By and By, go down Moses, swing low sweet chariot. The more you listen to Robeson, the better he sounds. Robeson is the American equivalent of the Irish Tenor John McCormack. If you like one, you will like the other."
4,The Great Voice of the 20th Century,"I cannot say better than Brian Foster. I agree with his assessment entirely. Try, Green Pastures, Big Fella, ""Paul Robeson"" (the CD), and The Voice of The Mississippi, and then see how you feel about The Power & the Glory."
1,New Mexico Railroads: A Historical Survey,"The book is great. I've owned it for years. But I looked at it out of curiousity on Amazon and somehow they sent it to me -- not one but two. Of course, I sent them both back, but I'm not going to take another chance with Amazon."
5,Essential listens for funkmeisters,"This album rocks. It is the first in the series that I bought and now I am hooked on the Dope on Plastic name. I can't quite put my finger on what kind of music that it actually is, but in this case, I actually think that is a good thing. It is very groovy and upbeat, but not too upbeat. Perfect for parties, cooking and long car trips. Two big thumbs up!"
1,Disillusioned,"When I received the Prophecies of Mother Shipton I expected to receive a book which contained a compendium of her prophecies. Instead,I received a pamphlet consisting of a one prophecy fortelling the death of Cardinial Wolsey, the Lord Percy & others during the reign of Henry the VIII. Additionally in the book there are prophecies by Lady Eleanor Audeley which is not indicated in the title. Therefore I think the title of this book is misleading. In no way do I consider this book to be representative of Mother Shipton."
2,Very uncomfortable,"These are the most uncomfortable things to wear. I only have problems in my left foot and wearing just one is uncomfortable. To help with hammer toe, I put pads inbetween the toes and a cushion pad under the second toe."
3,It's OK.....,I have a neuroma and problems with one toe on my foot and willing to try everything to reduce the pain. This cushion helped my aching foot somewhat but it was annoying as it kept moving in my shoe and had to reposition it all the time.
2,no help,I wish I could say this product helped but it wanted to shift around and just overall was not comfortable.
5,Superior product for hammer toe,Very good product. Great fit and nice application as adjustment piece does not fall out easily. Much better than gel items previously used.
3,crest cushion,the cushion effect is excellent the only problem is the elastic pull tape doesnt stay tight enough...use with my bath sandals
2,Uncomfortable,This for me was very uncomfortable. I have done better with the flat type. I believe it is a Buddha.
1,Terribly Made,"What you can't see from the picture is that this device has one very narrow elastic band to secure it to one toe. If that band is not in the correct spot on your toe, it does not push it down to keep it straight. The puffy underbody of this device is very uncomfortable to walk in (without shoes on, I mean. It is virtually impossible to wear shoes with this). I would instead reccomend the tripple toe straightener from Footsmart.com, item #40169. Even if you only have a problem with one toe, this device makes more sense because it has wider and sturdier bands, and a flat backing that covers all three toes. It is far more comfortable to wear. I have only been using it for about two weeks, but I think it is making a difference. The problem is that most of these devices are next to impossible to wear with shoes on because they are bulky and the bands pinch inside shoes. They can be worn comfortably around the house with slipper socks over them."
1,bad fit,The elastic band is too big to hold securely. The devise was supposed to be suede and is some kind of cloth. All together it is very disappointing. If i had the box i would send it back.
4,New light on old characters,"Lady Catherine de Bourgh has some unexpected visitors when a carriage comes to grief close to the gates of Rosings. The Delavals seem as though they may have an ulterior motive for having an accident exactly where they did but the rules of hospitality are binding on such as Lady Catherine.Very soon the brother and sister are part of the household. Meanwhile Mr Bennett of Longbourn has died and the pompous clergyman, Mr Collins must go and sort out his inheritance leaving his wife, Charlotte, about to give birth to twins in the company of her sister Maria Lucas.This entertaining story - subtitled a Jane Austen Entertainment - is an amusing read. It introduces some plausible new characters to the society of Rosings and casts new light on some of those who also appear in Jane Austen's `Pride and Prejudice'. I enjoyed it and thought it was well written though I did feel the ending was a little rushed."
1,Ludricrous and unsatisfactory,This novel was a big disappointment to me. It began with great promise but then fell apart at its midpoint. I can only conclude that Ms. Aikens was writing under a deadline because the resolution of the various plot lines in the novel's concluding scene is ludicrous and unsatisfactory. So save your money for another book.
1,Disappointing,"I had rather high hopes for this books but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. It had a lot of promise-- starting with a love affair between Maria Lucas and Colonel Fitzwilliam and the secret past of Lady Catherine's late husband, Sir Lewis. These plots just fizzled and turned out to be annoying. I also thought that since Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins were in the book it would have been entertaining, but I was wrong. Aiken didn't know how to play characters like that. Mr. Collins had a brief cameo and Lady Catherine wasn't nearly wonderfully awful as Austen would her out to be. I don't suggest this book. Not at all. If you have a compulsion to read it,get it from the library and save your money."
2,Glaring errors spoiled what might have been a good story.,"This would have been an excellent book if had not had so many glaring errors.If the reader wish- es to read a decent sequel to P&P,I suggest that they read ""Letters From Pemberley"".That was much better done.Ms.Aiken should at least read the book she is writing a sequel to before she writes her story."
5,the host finally shuts up,"Shiggar Fraggar vol's 4 and 5 are great because most of the tracks are pure music (unlike vol's 2 and 3 where the host won't shut up). Just about anything put out by ISP is great, but of the Shiggar Fraggars, this one is worth tracking down (even if you heard one that wasn't)."
3,Budget amp,"Did not put out as much power as I expected for 240 watts, but for the price I really can't complain. Was easy to install and I don't get any interference whatsoever.UPDATE: Not sure what happened, but the amp quit working. Fuse ok, radio ok, speaker wires ok."
2,Cheap for a reason,"Given that this knife is designed to cut hard cheeses, it seems to me to fail in two important ways: First, it isn't very sharp, and second, the cutting blade is thick.Granted, it's inexpensive, but any sharp knife you have handy will do just as well."
4,HISTORY OF THE WESTERN FRONTIER - VERY INFORMATIVE,The documentaries that are included in this collection were well done.I have read several books on the Western Frontier and seen manymovies on this period. These documtaries were well done and filled ingaps in my knowledge of the men and events shown.
4,Yet Another New Direction,"In my never ending quest for good music, every so often I come across something that I consider a gem, which to me is a collection of music that is beautiful, inspiring, innovative, re playable, and above all things, enjoyable. The Myst franchise has been consistantly giving me gems for the last few years that i've been turned onto the music, and Myst V: End Of Ages is no disappointment. Tim Larkin is clearly not afraid to push boundaries and take the music of the game to places you wouldn't expect it to go, which makes the soundtrack stand alone rather easily. I say this not having played the game, or any of the Myst games but the first. The sounds used take you to various regions of the world, most of which come from middle eastern influence and instruments. The bottom line is that I love this album. Its beautiful, its cool new sound, and easily contends for my favorite spot out of the Myst soundtracks thus far. 4/5 stars."
5,Relive the excitement!!,"Great compilation of the unforgetable 1999 season that was the Rams rise to glory. These 3 games are from the playoff drive including the Super Bowl. Warner to Bruce to start the game against Minnesota, Warner to Proehl for the win against the Bucs, alet's not forget Mike Jones' game saving tackle to preserve the win in against the Titans. Great gift for the Rams fan in your family!!"
3,Great Memory,This brought back loads of memories as I was there for all these games.It was fun to sit back and watch them all again and relive the Rams Superbowl run.I was a little disapointed in the DVD quality as it was not the best.
3,disappointing,"This volume is handsome and visually appealing, but its contents are a disappointment. The appellation ""atlas"" is entirely inappropriate for a work that contains only a handful of maps scattered across hundreds of pages and pays almost zero attention to regional variations. The work also spoke little about ""culture,"" choosing to zero in on specific historical anecdotes, generalizations about historic ties with China, and the most cursory information on the life of the modern Japanese. I was very, very disappointed. It's a nice book, but it's not at all what I expected."
4,Great shirt. Keep an iron handy.,I didn't think man made materials could wrinkle easily but this shirt gets creased as you wear it through the day. Other than that it's a beautiful shirt and feels great.
2,window visor,the tape isn't that strong. i had to put some gorilla glue because they were coming off.
4,Inspiring and sound advice on keeping an aquarium,"This book combines inspiring and sound guidance on topic of setting up and maintaining beginner and intermediate aquaria, particularly those containing live plants. Very helpful in sorting out genuinely useful hardware from costly and usually unecessary high tech gadgets. Nice photos, line drawings and extensive descriptions of successful fish and plants. Worth keeping an eye out for. Sorry to learn its out of print."
5,Very complete,"I've read many books on the subject and this is, by far, the best one out there for beginners who want to build a succesfull aquarium. Very easy to read and understand. You will learn everything you need to know and more about water chemistry, fish and plants."
2,Not impressed,"This ring had such great ratings, after visiting it often, I finally bought it as a gift. When I saw it in person, I was not impressed. It does look like the picture, but it also looks cheap. I do realize it costs cheap, I just wasn't impressed. It did arrive VERY quickly though."
3,"Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Celtic Knot Ring Size 9 (Size 4,5,6,7,8,9) Review",I bought this ring a long time ago and I do not wear it anymore. It seemed to look old too fast due to the sterling silver.
2,thin ring,Silver on bottom of ring paper thin and came with marks on it. Very poor quality the top of ring was nice.
4,"Ok, but more for a child","Ring is very very pretty, but small. Would be better suited for a child and I gave it to my granddaughter who loves it. I rated it high because the ring itself is very pretty."
4,Great for the price,"I think this ring is abosolutely beautiful! And for that price, I couldn't pass it up."
4,Beautiful Ring,"The ring was beautiful and the sizing was perfect. My only complaint, is how easily it bends...but I am also rough on jewelry and believe the cost vs product value is excellent."
3,gin,"The ring has a very pretty silver design, but the stone is very light blue topaz that appears transparent or green in the right light."
5,love the ring,I love my celtic knot ring from Silver Insanity. I've loved everything I've ordered from this company and will certainly order from them again.
3,An enjoyable short read...,"Before this book, I never knew about the Jewish ghetto in Prague, where Jews lived for hundreds of years, barely making much contact with the outside world, and when they did, facing great discrimination along the way. Rivka, the main character, is consistered to be part of the upper class in the ghetto. Her father is a doctor, and she is set to marry a man who everyone loves- except her, for she doesn't even know him. After seeing a bit of the outer world of the ghetto on an errand with her father, she decides she must go again...but this time she'll go as a Gentile boy. However, the outside is so tempting, and Rivka finds herself drawn out again and again. She just can't get caught."
3,Gorgeous but hollow,"The Bottom Line:It cannot be denied that Renaissance's black-and-white rotoscoping effect is very pleasing to the eye, but the central mystery of the movie isn't interesting enough to keep viewers' interests after the novelty of the visuals fades; I admired a lot about the film, including its vision of 2054 France, but the storytelling wasn't very compelling and when I wasn't staring agog at the animation I was staring at my watch.2.5/4"
4,"Amazing visuals, though plot could be better","As I hoped, the visual style of the movie was breathtaking--not only the black/white effects, but also the architectural setting and interior design, the camera angles and shadows. The visuals worked perfectly to create the emotional environment of a cyberpunk drama.The plot kept up the pace, but only barely so. I found it too dark, lacking in depth, higher emotions, and sophistication. It was no match for Gattaca's (my token of sci-fi/cyberpunk perfection).Though it is easy for some to concentrate on the deficiencies of the plot, it provides an adequate backdrop for the visuals. The visuals carry emotional meaning and in some ways compensate for the deficiencies of the plot. Renaissance definitely broke new, exciting ground visually, and for that it is exceedingly noteworthy."
4,Really good,"ProsAnimation- this movie is one of the most visually stunning things I've seen. The motion capture kicks Beowulf and Polar Express' arses. The rain and city looks very uniqueStory- Is quite engaging, and you really get into it. It will remind you of Minority ReportThere is definite replay value.ConThere is no big twist. It's not shocking. I'm still glad I own it, but it doesn't hit you. This is why I take away a star. I was really into this film, but towards the end there was no twist. I'll still watch it again, but the end is sort of deadening."
4,SEE this film,"This film is a visual experience. Try to remember the first time you watched 2001: A Space Odyssey. You knew that it was made in the late 60's, but were still blown away by the visuals.Well, Renaissance is its the visual equivalent. Too bad the storyline isn't as good as it could have been, hence only 4 stars."
4,Pretty good,I rented this movie not really knowing anything about it and was surprised when I saw it was animated and I just wish it had color but other than that it was pretty good.
3,"Great effects, poor story-telling.","I just saw this. Fascinating use of technology, but neither a good story nor compelling characters. I can't really recommend it.The look of the film was striking, but the sparcity of visual information (lots of solid blacks throughout) made some of the action awkward and hard to follow. All the characters looked sort of the same and most of the action took place in darkly lit locales.Ho-hum."
5,Better than Ghost in the Shell!,"This movie is waaaay better than the 1st Ghost in the Shell flick! Not because of the better animation, or the better special effects! Even though this flick was made in and animated in a black and white style it's still better! This is the only movie that reminded me of Sin City but still kept me interested in watching it from beginning to end! The animation, the acting, and the action were all flawless in execution! Even if you rent it...it's still a great buy! Another thing to keep in mind is that Daniel Craig does a great job acting here and you don't see him fail like in the Bond Movies!"
2,FX great; no story worth watching,"Whether it's the vapid ""Sky Captain and the World of Tommorrow, the sophomoric ""A Waking Life,"" or now ""Renaissance,"" it seems Hollywood studios can't get the special effects out of their eyes long enough to see that an interesting (dare we hope for intelligent?) story is necessary.I thought the B&W; rotoscoping was a daring and novel piece of work, but the story had all the flair of a Junior HS student in his first creative writing class. I couldn't bring myself to finish watching it. A total bore."
2,I lost interest quickly,"This is almost entirely b&w animation. If you're that kind of a movie geek, you might like this. I tuned out almost immediately. I couldn't find 007 Daniel Craig either."
1,What in the world were they thinking?,"I have to agree with Thomas J. Bonner. I have no idea where anyone got 'visually stunning' where this movie is concerned. It's in black and white and like a comic strip for Pete's sake. Just look at the picture on the box and know that this is how the whole movie is presented. So, what is so visually stunning?"
1,terrible movie,I would like to break the rumor that this is a good movie. This movie is terrible. The movie is not visualy stunning and the black and white is boreing within minutes. The story is not very interesting and culminates in a very disapointing ending. I was very disapointed that i wasted my money on this movie.
5,I like this book,"This book is for those who like business history. Mr. Sobel tells the story of the great conglomerate but goes far beyond simple description, providing a deep and exhaustive analysis of ITT itself and the whole phenomenon of business conglomeration. I would also suggest further reaging--The Rise and Fall of the Conglomerate Kings (by Sobel again) and The ITT Wars: An Insider's View of Hostile Takeovers, written by ITT's former CEO."
4,She comes off as extremely selfish,"Nobody knows the author's motives but the author himself. With that said I admit to being just floored that Carolyn Bessette had two abortions and a miscarriage (supposedly). If she was as intelligent as everyone says why on earth did she not practice birth control? How could she be so selfish and decide to end the lives of her unborn children because ""it's just not the right time."" She had choices and she could have been responsible prior to conception (same goes for Michael Bergin). The assumption is that JFK Jr. had no idea his wife had two abortions...I am not at all pleased that my opinion of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy has changed and for the worse. I once thought the world of her and I cant help but feel disappointed."
3,Wake up people!,"Carolyn Bessette was obviously in need of depression medication and a good therapist. Here everyone thinks she had such class while secretly she was jumping into bed with Lord knows how many men and wasn't even taking precautions to avoid unwanted pregnancy, I can see one mistake but 3? I can imagine that Jackie must have been rolling in her grave when her son hooked up with this one. What I do wonder is why Michaek Bergin would make himself look so bad in print."
3,Entertaining,"I purchased the book because I read an article in a magazine about it and I found interesting the story, besides, I had a huge crush on Michael Bergin back in the nineties !!! It may not win a Nobel Prize of literature but at least you can tell the author was candid and honest, maybe too much...I do not doubt his feelings about Carolyn Bessette and I really think he had the right to express his point of view about their story, but I also think he could have kept a few details for himself. I think the book would have been as interesting as it is without those details. I also found interesting to realize that no matter if you are rich, beautiful and famous...you still can have your heart broken and feel you are living a miserable life."
1,judging the book by the cover,"For once you can indeed judge the book by the cover! This looks like a bad book and it is bad. We just got this in and I read it (most of it, because I skipped a few parts) and boy is it bad. The author Michael Bergin isn't the smartest guy around, but that isn't the real problem. The main problem is that the book doesn't have a point (except maybe to get money). He is a guy that Carolyn Bisset had a few dates with, who she trusted on some points and then kept in the dark when she started going out with John John ... big deal. He was her boy toy, a good looking guy she could never be content with. And now that his modeling career is finished, he betrays a dead woman's trust to make a few bucks. Just terrible!"
1,Waste of Time,Don't waste time with hollowed-out bagel; wanna-be rich-and-famous model gets dumped by beautiful jet setter for American prince. Nothing else happens. Not a single<alleged> conversation or interlude worth repeating. Meow is all she said.
1,embarassing!!!,"We grew up with Mike and we wish he would stop mentioning our ""small blue collar town"" because he's giving it a bad name!!!SHAME ON YOU, Mike, LET THIS TRAGIC STORY(not YOUR love story) REST IN PEACE!!"
1,"Shameless, self-promoting book!","Obviously, Michael's only claim to fame is that he had a relationship with a woman who happened to marry American royalty and therefore become famous. So what does any ex-Times Square model do to cash in?...he writes a book! Shame on him for exploiting her private life when there is no one left to corroborate what the truth really is. Maybe if Carolyn was still alive she would write her own book...The Other Side: My Story. Don't waste your money on this garbage!"
1,STOP!,"Before you click and add this to your cart, please reconsider. If you can afford $18.17, do something useful and donate the money to a worthwhile charity instead. Rather than promoting this literary debacle and its self-promoting author...consider saving the life of an animal with your donation, contributing to cancer research, etc. We all know how this story ends, but you can help rewrite the ending for someone or something else! Every little bit helps. Thank you."
1,Exploitation once again.,"First, Ed Smart exploits his kidnapped daughter's trevails and writes a book for money. Then, Richard Clarke does his grandstand and writes a book to exploit the tragedy of 9/11 for money. So, why should we be surprised that Michael Bergin, a pretty boy pinup model with an IQ of 85, would exploit for money the memory and relationship with a woman he suppposedly loved? He talks about Carolyn's multiple abortions, infidelities, and insecurities with a casualness of describing a season of baseball. These are dead people he is maligning, and they are unable to defend themselves. Whatever happened of ""speak no ill of the dead""???I read this book this morning, just to see if it were as bad as I expected. It is."
1,People are entitled to their privacy. Respect for the Dead Michael MOney Grubber.,"With his mouth the godless destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous escape... A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy man keeps a secret.He who covers over an offense promotes love, but whoever repeats the matter separates close friendsThe words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts.A gossip betrays a confidence; so avoid a man who talks too much."
1,"Cheap, very very Cheap","what a cheap way to make a profit! Just read the footnotes of the pictures! it's all it takes!The book is a revelation of shameless man ( with a wife by the way! where was she? ) taking advantage of the life of JFK Jr and his tragedy. I found it boring, insulting and misleading."
1,Cheesy,"This is no more than another example of cheap opportunism and self-aggrandizement masquerading as a ""tell all"" confession. It is not particularly well-written and tells the reader a whole lot more about the writer than he would likely want us to know. He's mainly interested in exploiting his l5 minutes of fame. I borrowed this book from a houseguest, and found it to be just another piece of sleazy junk that I was unable to finish. Don't buy this thing - it's trash."
1,What an idiot!!!!!,"Has this guy done ANYTHING since Baywatch??? His writing style is that of a third grader...and how dare he come out with this gossip AFTER she's dead? Who can defend her? If what this brainstem says in the book IS true, he looks like a human bobo doll being used by a very troubled, yet smart as a fox woman.She was no dummy.This dude needs to get a life. I'm so ashamed to say I let my human curiosity get the best of me and read this trash.Sorry John.......Sorry Carolyn."
3,"prostitute Carolyn, Insecure Michael, Confused Kennedy","Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll never know fully what drove Carolyn to play such a number on Michael's heart (how CRUEL was she?), yet we know that in order for us to assess the situation ourselves we need more details as to what kind of a person she really was. Knowing that she was emotionally needy and she was a nervous sleeper with some abondoment issues isn't enough. We need details! Unfortunately the book doesn't have many of those. Just the same repetitive formula about how beautiful she was (I beg to differ) and how complicated she was (need more detail). Overall, it all left me empty."
2,karma bites,"Chapter after chapter, Michael pines for a woman who obviously needs mental help. She's ashamed to be seen in public with him, cheats on him, and gets pregnant with another man's baby and claims it's Michael's. In the end, Mike finally gets a good woman. As for Carolyn, ""What goes around, comes around"". Karma bites, doesn't it?"
3,Give this guy a break,"To the majority of reviewers who did not read the book but are trashing it, give this guy a break. We are all flawed and we are all human. Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with his decision to write this book, this is his life experience! He dispels the ""fairy tale "" myth of Camelot.Life is real! Perhaps he is even giving us insight on why Carolyn never seemed happy after winning the most eligible man in the world. Once again we learn a valuable lesson here: Marry for love not MONEY!"
1,Save Your Money!,Don't be an idiot like me and waste your hard-earned money on this book. I may be able to get 50-cents out of it at my yard sale!
1,The Other Man,"What this man did lacks class and reveals his shallow nature. If he honestly cared for Carolyn he would never have dishonored her in the wake of her tragic death...and profit from this shameful book. I can only imagine how she would feel about the writing of this book. Ironic how this books juxtaposes chivalry in the shaming of a ""son of Camelot""...Camelot where chivalry was the honor of the day."
1,Leave Them Alone.......,"I'm not very old at all, but maybe now I've really seen everything. The book & now this pitiful little man's confessions on ET. The curse is not being a Kennedy, rather it's being helpless victims to these desperate for 15 minutes of glory wolves. For God's sake, let them rest in peace. If all this happened, why did you wait so long? Do you need money so badly that you'll publish such an invasive tale while no one is alive to refute your rubbish? Get somewhat of a life, you hapless joke. Oh, don't worry, plenty of sucklings & lickspittles will buy your trash & you'll find raking in the cash is just as easy as when you're where modeling your emaciated body for your underwear ads. Personally, I hope you fall flat on your face. Shame on you, little boy."
1,Pathetic,"If Bergin was so proud of his relationship with Caroline, why not write the book while she was still alive? Money, that's why. He's making much more with her dead, and that is just terrible. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but this book is poorly written gossip about someone not alive to contradict him or defend herself. Bergin should be ashamed."
1,When your modeling days are over and your,TV Career never gets off the ground-write a piece ofFICTION about a famous former lover who is conveniently dead and unable to refute the libelous and truly unflattering pictorial of her. This book is trash and the motive is obvious.
1,Michael Berin is a LIAR!!,The Documentary on TV was rehearhed and Michaels's Acting was atrocious! He has to be doing it for money! Who would trash someone they truly Loved!Any People Person knows He is a Liar!!
3,The Other Loser,"All three of these people lost at love and it is sad to know all the details.I read this book and found it compelling..........in that you wanted to know what happened next with Carolyn and Michael. So, it was a page turner.However............Michael is severely lacking in self understanding. To reveal Carolyn's behavior is NOT to glorifly her memory, honor her memory, or correct misunderstandings. Frankly, he has revealed her to be extremely screwed up.And if he thinks what they had is a love story, he has a misguided idea of what happens between people who love each other.I'm glad he wrote the book, because it helps confirm to me that people whom the media glorify.......like Carolyn Bessette can actually be in much worse shape than simple nobodies like myself."
1,"A love story, indeed...love of money!","I can't beleive I read this book. It has some interesting stories about Ms. Bessette (although very, very unflattering), but falls apart when Mr. Bergin talks of his 'love' for her. It's just simian sentimentality and it doesn't read true. Next year you'll find this in the extras bin for 25 cents - right next to ""Monica's Story""."
1,Don't waste your money....,"Frankly, I so regret having spent that much money for this book! If Carolyn Bessette wouldn't have married John Kennedy Jr. we would have never heard about her ""love story"" with Michael Bergen, right? Clearly, the book has been written for money, nothing else. Theirs was a relationship based on sex and nothing more. Carolyn was mentally unstable and also very superficial, not the main ingredients for a great love story... I had the impression of wasting my time reading that book, it's only banalities IMHO."
4,The Other Man,"I loved the book. I thought it was honest and lovely I enjoyed reading it. It's ok Michael I feel you told the truth. Enjoy your family, I'm sure Carolyn is smiling down at you for the choices you made for both of you."
5,Bravo,"What an amazing and truthful book. The customer reviews for this book are NOT reviews, many have said that they haven't read the books. Save us all some time and keep your personal thoughts about the author to yourself, they have nothing to do with this book. I think it's clear that the author waited a long time to bring this forward and to shed some light on JFK Jr's wife, a lot of things that nobody knew previously. Getting rich is not the goal with writing this book, at least I didn't come away with that thought after actually READING the book."
4,The Other Man,"This is a wonderful, truthful book that explores the depths of true love. I found myself wanting more...No matter how famous or powerful someone is they still fall prey to ""real emotions"" that the average person experiences. I think this book is a wonderful book and story that makes you feel and experience the joy and the pain of the relationship between Michael and Carolyn Bessette. I saw the interview on A & E and my heart was absolutely breaking for Michael. I am happy to learn he is happily married with a beautiful family. I respect him for coming forward and clearing Carloyn's name. I hate to hear some of the things that have been said...and he had wonderful things to say about her...when he talks about her he just glowed. I think he is very genuine."
1,"SO THIS IS LOVE???? Self-serving love, maybe.....","Revealing unflattering secrets of a dead woman regarding abortion, cocaine use, infidelity etc...is hardly the kind of thing which will put the dead at peace and give closure to their families as irrationally claimed by the author. Now that the sordid truth is out, there will surely be closure, according to this intellectually disabled man ( and I use the term ""man"" loosely). Anyone who buys that propaganda is one taco short of combination plate. I hope his current gal doesn't have any ""secrets"" she doesn't want the world to know b/c she's certainly at risk. A real man would have kept this stuff to himself. I won't buy it or read it. I won't read anything from the publisher again and I won't watch anything in which this guy appears. It doesn't rate one star, but I didn't have a choice."
1,Let me be honest....,"I have not read this book. I do not need to read it becauseall the reviews I have read from customers tell me that what Ibelieved about it are true.. this is just a guy who's time haspassed and needs to make a buck. I saw an interview on t.v. where he ""broke down"" and believe me, he's got no future in acting, either. There is absolutely no need for this exploitivebook. For those who have written in and warned us off...thankyou."
2,the other man,"I would not pay full price for the book. I have no way of knowing how much of it is true or not true, but I did not find it believable, particularly the latter part. Without rehashing the whole book, I find it unlikely they could meet repeatedly in hotels without her being noticed, that she could sit outside the step of his house crying in full view without anyone seeing her, that she asked for his help to leave jfk jr. and went after his taxi when he left. I liked the books by Christopher Andersen and Edward Klein much better, and found them more believable, even though of course I have no way of knowing either way. My recommendation is that if someone wants to read the book they not pay full price."
1,Don't waste your money!,This book is filled with lies. Don't waste your money and make this looser rich. He just wrote this book to get money because he can't find work and he's too old and ugly to model anymore! He thinks he can get away with this because Carolyn isn't here to defend herself. If he really loved this girl he would have stayed quiet and not tried to make money off of her. There was a reason she married John Jr. and that was because she loved him! This looser needs to get a life.
4,Average.. yet Above Average,"I'd give this book 3.5 but I cant... I found this book to be very well informing of all types of stages in trasining to be a green beret and the conciseness... Though it lacks detailed first-hand accounts on what the training is like and rather usually just gives a brief overview. It does however have alot of pictures and often times (brief but) particular information on other stages of the course like the Scuba and even has a course outline and pictures on SERE.This book is really good for those that have no working foundation on process of becoming SF, yet its also good if you already have one because it presents the information in a clearer concise presentation. If you want more detailed first-hand accounts on the actual training read Dick Couch's ""Chosen Soldier"""
5,Excellent,"Probably the best single resource I've ever seen about Army S.F., recommend to anyone interested in this field!"
5,Terrific Pictures,This book a is a great motivator for anyone getting ready to join Special Operations in any branch.
1,Not enough space...,"Well, this was to organize my glove box. Not sure what everyone else has in the box, but for me it simply didn't provide enough space. All compartments are very tight, forget to fill both sides - you wouldn't be able to close the organizer. If you have a few business cards and a pen to store, this would do - otherwise I would not recommend it. I had to return it."
3,"I expected better, But hey , What are you gonna do??","Its a good purchase if your gonna store auto documents and stuff of that nature. But owners manual to you car, and other nik naks, Get a bigger one. Amazon offers quite a few in various sizes."
1,Smells,"This product smells like rubber. It ended up in a plastic bag, and I believe the next stop will be the garbage bin."
2,Little Man Writes Little Book,"It is a man with little imagination that writes a book about historical events that no one cares about. The editing was badly done, with several errors that I picked up with only one reading. Yes, documentary literature has its place in the literary world, however this one would not be missed if it had not been written.It has been suggested that he is writing a book about a Mass Murder. God forbid! Literature has been murdered enough in the past. Do we really want Murder in the Unimaginative in the present"
5,Like me,"I'm a lot like Frances. But if a guy like Theo told me to fight for him id be like ""heck yeah"""
5,Great Shirt,"I bought this shirt for my husbands birthday and he loved it. I love that when I wash it and dry it, it doesn't need ironing."
1,Too Cheesy for words,A mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s. Don't even bother....
4,Before the Sopranos there was Joey...,"I read this many years ago when it first came out entitled as 'Killer' and thought it was a fascinating look at the business of crime. However, I just bought the reissue and noticed that a whole chapter devoted to Joey and his feelings about women was dropped. Why so? Were the publishers getting PC about a Mafia killer so as not to offend new readers? Anyone have the original? And does anyone have any info on Joey's real name? A mention was made of his obit in Time magazine...date and issue anyone?"
3,Real life autobiography of Jewish hitman.,"I read the original ""Killer"", by Joey, back in the early 70`s.I also saw a masked ""Joey"" interviewed on the Sunday evening talk show ""Open Mind"" by David Susskind. Susskind berates Joey, at one point, for using the slur""Pollack"". Susskind said""You wouldn`t want me to use an anti-Italian epithet, would you?""Joey retorted.""I wouldn`t care, really, since I`m not Italian. I`m Jewish""(Susskind was stunned!) Also, in ""Killer"", Joey recounts a meeting in a NYC club with the reputed Columbo crime family soldier, Carmine Di Biasi, in which he describes shoving the barrel of his revolver into Di Biasi`s mouth after Di Biasi ""insulted my Ethnic backround"". All in all,this is not a Primer on organized crime.To really enjoy this book you are better off reading a few other books first, such as ""Mafia USA"",""The Grim Reapers"",""Pictorial History of the Mafia"" or ""The Vallachi Papers""."
3,Anitquated,"Some good anecdotes. My problem with this book is that, in contrast to books written later, it is totally anonymous. Might have been necessary in the old days, but those were the old days."
1,The Cheshire Cat is Smiling,"What a hilarious irony. Books like this (and sick movies like Farenheit 9/11) are GOING TO ELECT GEORGE BUSH TO A 2nd TERM. As David Brooks lamented in tne NY Times about Michael Moore, ""The standards of acceptable liberal opinion have shifted. We're a long way from John Dewey."" Mr. Franks book is going to be a giant hit in the university district in Seattle, but this book, and Moore's movies will be powerful tools in the hands of Republicans next November when it comes time to portray Democrats as being looney conspiracy theorists. So thoughtful Democrats should be concerned about over-the-top books like this, and Republicans should be rejoicing. I guess not too many of the Amazon reviewers have the necessary subtlety to discern this irony."
4,great insight,"If you have ever wondered about what (if anything) is rattling around in W's head, this is good insight!"
2,It doesn't take a book,"Although the author who clearly has impeccable credientials makes excellent points about the President and the entire Bush dynasty regarding the psychological motivations for all of their behaviors, particularly W's, this could have all been covered in a long article. The author did offer very intersting biographical information to flesh out the story but the end result was still very repetitious."
3,Nation now on the couch,"I would have given a higher rating if the author interviewed Bush. But the analysis of Bush's thinking (or lack of) and his simplified all or nothing way of looking at the world along with a heavy dose of narcissism beginning in his formative years shows the reader why we are in the mess we find ourselves in. I would have liked to have more information about his relationship with his wife Barbara. Overall, an interersting book about the worst president to date."
1,Far too Freudian for my taste!,"I really did not like this book and got bored before I finished it. He starts with Freudian premises that have already been largely rejected by the psychological community. Then Frank builds all of his subsequent beliefs and conclusions on these premises, so if you think the initial assumptions are false, like I did, then the rest of the book just degenerates into a bunch of theoretical nonsense. I am no Bush fan, and I think he is probably nuts in some interesting ways, but this book did not get at any of them. I have heard that Freud was an undiagnosed and untreated drug addict, so his theories have a lot of denial built into them, and certainly no awareness of the addictive family systems that have been developed in recent decades. THAT would be a revealing Bush study, but this one was just a bunch of complicated but essentially silly German beard pulling."
3,Freud Meets Dubya,"This is a great read for people who hate both Bush and Sigmund Freud. The author obviously adores Freudian psychologist Melanie Klein, and uses her preposterous theories (such as how babies are born with destructive impulses as a result of ""fighting their way"" out of the womb) to explain George W's neuroses. Skip the Freudian nonsense, though, and you will get to the heart of the matter: whatever way you analyze him, the President is a paranoid, learning-disabled, ""dry"" alcoholic with delusions of grandeur. Very scary indeed."
4,What every American should know about G W Bush,"Although sometimes repetitive this outlines the mental state and functioning of our current president. I had just startedreading the book at the time GWB walked up behind the German Chancellor at an international meeting, the G8?, and started to give her a neck rub. I thought how inappropriate and how GWB. It is unforunate the such a review of our president could not be done for all presidential candidates before elections. Our world would be a more peacful place and the level of international respect for our country would be much higher. It is apparent that GWB looks at most situations as black and whitewhich is so narrow minded and unbalenced."
5,This book should not be ignored!!,"The author raises some very serious questions about the most powerful man in the country. While I am not a psychologist, the book does a very good job explaining the academic subject matter and then how it applies to the President.I would suggest that the 1-Star reviewers, unless they are psychologists and/or have degrees in psychology, can not / should not readily dismiss the analysis performed by the author.This is an important book, whether you are a Democrat or Republican."
4,great insight but sources on dry drunk not properly credited,"This book provides the facts that explain Bush's foreign policy, the madness in his method. Some of the facts have not been revealed before; Dr. Frank explains, for example, the meaning of a certain heart rate. However, his chapter on alcoholism and irrational thinking-the dry drunk thesis--was derived from the writings of Alan Bisbort, Michael O'McCarthy, and myself. Yet the only reference is to the theory ""bandied about on the Internet."" In fact, we've published articles in the Irish Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, as well as commondreams and our theories which are described in full should have been attributed to us. (go to google and type in dry drunk and they come up).Perhaps he will do so in the future."
2,OK but Not Worth the Time,"I thought I would devour this book, considering the juicy topic, but instead found myself yawning most of the way through it. For all of his psychological training, Frank tells us little that the bright layperson cannot figure out from merely observing Bush in action through his rare press conferences, appalling attempts at public speaking, and reading up on the background and personality of this man we are currently reduced to calling president. I searched long and hard for this book (it was hard to find on the shelves at the time I was looking as it was going through a reprint.), but you can save your time and energy for something more stimulating. I gave up 3/4 of the way through and felt released to look for something really worth the time."
5,A reveling well-supported documentary,This work is revealing and well supported and accurately reflects the president and his full constellation of mental disorders.
4,Compelling read,"Though some may question whether or not it is possible to analyze a public figure at a distance, this is the only Bush book that gives the public any clue as to who this man really is, and what makes him tick. Frank connects the dots in Bush's behavior patterns and provides a credible, if chilling, profile of the president."
1,Just another Bush attack book,"Well, you can tell its an election year. We've had lots and lots of books attacking the president in the last few months, and certain publishers seem to be choosing their timing in very deliberate fashion. This one is comically bad. It is one thing to criticize the president's economic or foreign policy programs. It's quite another to claim that he is crazy!! This is really over the top, but in all fairness, if you hate Bush's guts already and just want to feel good about your resentments, then you'll love this book."
1,Unethical,"It is patently unethical and unprofessional to write psychoanalytic reports on someone who is not your patient. It is equally unacceptable to write about someone who is. Either way, Justin Frank, an amateur demagogue, should surrender his license to the nearest highway patroleman."
1,Put me to sleep.,This is one of the poorest written books I have ever read. The topic is great but this falls way short.
1,Psycho Babble,"I heard the author interviewd on Air America (Where else?) by nitwit Randi Rhodes. So the professor is a psychoanalyst, but one must remember psychoanalysis went out with high button shoes. It is not real psychotherapy which can be useful, but a high priced con game that does not stand up to scientific scrutiny. A lot of people don't like Bush, me included. The offensive part is that this is smarmy self riteous psuedo science presented as something profound and meaningful. I have no problem with political opinion except when it masquerades as something else as is the case here."
1,Transparent Agenda,Armchair psychology is rarely accurate... and this book is no different. It's a clear case of finding only what you are looking for. This Dr. has done his profession a disservice by ignoring anything that doesn't support his slanted view. This hastily thrown together book is only about making money off the public at the expense of true psychological ethics.
1,3 reactions,"There are only 3 possible analyses of this book:(1.) I'm a leftwinger, hate George Bush, and I love this book.(2.) I'm a rightwinger, love George Bush, and hate this book.(3.) I'm an apolitical psychologist, and this book is an embarrassment to me."
4,Superb Book Overall,"I started reading this book with an open mind. Frankly, even if I don't agree with our President's views, I tend to sleep better at night knowing he is sane. Well, I haven't been sleeping as well lately.The author does a tremendous job in analyzing Bush based on his actions and correllating those with his childhood. For the most part, his conclusions make sense based on my own knowledge of psychology and plain common sense. The parts I found most interesting were the details and analysis of his childhood where the George Bush we see today was formed.My only issue was that the book became progressively more tedious to read. The psychological links and theories made my brain work harder than I would have liked for leisure reading. The information could have been condensed a bit better and flowed more smoothly.Overall though, this is a grounbreaking book in the sense that you feel as though you intimately know our President after reading it."
5,A Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Waste,"This is a literate analysis of George W. Bush written by a well respected psychologist. It is a book of conclusions based on careful observation and psychological analysis of the personality traits and behavior of the subject. Watch and listen to what George W. says and does and decide for yourself. Personally, I have always thought he has serious mental problems and this book confirms it.I find it interesting that most of the one star reviewers appear to be nothing more than political hacks who probably never read the book, and wouldn't understand it if they did. One of the more recent reviewers boiled it all down to partisan love/hate, and the other misspelled Psych 101 and called the author a psychiatrist. These reviews are good for laughs, but if you really want to understand the workings of a flawed mind, read this book and decide for yourself."
5,A Brillliant and Gripping Page Turner,"Dr. Frank had me from the opening paragraphs of his introduction:""If one of my patients frequently said one thing and did another, I would want to know why. If I found that he often used words that hid their true meaning, and affected a persona that obscured the nature of his actions, I would grow more concerned. If he presented an inflexible worldview characterized by an oversimplified distinction between right and wrong, good and evil, allies and enemies, I would question his ability to grasp reality. And if his actions revealed an unacknowledged-even sadistic-- indifference to human suffering, wrapped in pious claims of compassion, I would worry about the safety of the people whose lives he touched.""For the last three years, I have observed with increasing alarm the inconsistencies and denials of such an individual. But he is not one of my patients. He is our President.""How can you stop reading after that?"
5,Fresh perspective on what we've all been thinking,"An essential must-read for anyone with an interest in the current administration. This book removes the argument from sheer numbers or biased partisan bickering into a well thought out and psychoanalytic perspective.The other comments here provide a great background as to this work. Let me just add that this is one of those books that is simply hard to put down. Like a good novel, you - despite the depressing state of affairs with our administration - quickly develop a need to keep going into this book. I read it in just a few days.Consider this book for not just a new angle in political discourse, but simply for understanding how America is positioned in the world today."
2,Very difficult to understand!,"This book is written in a manner that makes it more useful for professors than students. Virtually no derivation paths for formulas are shown, which makes it almost impossible or very time-consuming to understand where they come from."
1,Woeful book - Utter waste of Time and Money,"Was recommended this book by college lecturer. Knowing what I know now about that guy, this book ranks where he did. Rubbish. For undergraduate Mechanical Engineering steer clear. Rubbish."
3,Mary J. Blige (Be Without You).,The item is ok. The amount of time it took for me to get this item was unacceptable.
5,Excellent condition,I am very pleased with my purchase. It came in excellent condition and in good timing. Thanks!
5,Awesome ! Just totally awesome !!!!,This book is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It has truely intensified my relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. A must read for all those who want a serious relationship with the Almighty.
1,Bad,"My wife grew up in the United Pentecostal Church. This book gives me the reasons why she still has problems when dealing with church and authority within it. Tenney twists the Bible switches translations when it suits him. Mostly KJV and then twists the scripture to match his beliefs. Typical Oneness Heresy. Unfortunately, people buy this stuff and treat like the Gospel itself.Sad really. I am glad I got it at a book sale for 50 cents I still paid too much."
4,A Passionate Book,"In looking at the reactions of the other reviewers it seems people either love this book or hate it. Furthermore, it appears some of the more harsh critics don't want to give the author the benefit of the doubt, i.e., they assume he has sinister motives or a hidden agenda. I don't want to be in the same corner with those of such a vitriolic disposition.It appears to me Tommy Tenney's central premise is, he had a major encounter with God and if you are hungry for God you can experience something similar. He goes on to describe that he wanted reality and not just a form of religion. He uses Scripture to make his case. This book is just a heartfelt effort to call people to a passionate encounter with God."
3,The God Chasers by Tommy Tenney,The book I had a few years ago had pictures of the split pulpit.I was disappointed.Other than that it is a good book
5,Best book ever!,I was challenged very much by this book. This book touched me in such a way that I don't want to settle for less.Jesus is coming back soon and I want to be ready and make sure that I have been working to see that others accept Jesus in their hearts. I'm not gonna settle for less anymore
5,Fuel For The Hungry,"In tenneys book you are challeged to take a look at yourself and wonder, how hungry am I? To those critics who say that tenney is after experiences and encounters only, I have this to say READ THE BOOK MORE CAREFULLY!!!!!! Tommy makes it clear in his book that we are to seek the face of God(2 Chron. 7:14) he vehemently states we are to seek Him and not His benefits only(Including experinces and feelings. I just returned from a Tenney meeting and I can assure you God was there. Hundreds of people responded to the altar call and wept in repentance and brokeness. I love you tommy, stay hot on His trail."
1,Painful!,"The time I spent reading this book totals up to about 30 minutes. I'm sorry to say its 30 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Tenney spends absolutely no time doing any expository preaching (I doubt he even knows what that is), instead telling story after story of supposed powerful visitations from God for which he provides only subjective proof. How anyone can endure such garbage to the end is beyond me. It just shows you what is popular isn't necessarily spiritually nourishing."
1,Another Pop Christianity book,"I had heard a lot about ""The God Chasers"" so I picked it up. The first chapter was excellent and I thought I had finally found a good book on experiencing the presence of God, which has been a life-long pursuit. After the initial chapter, the book degrades into a soapbox for Tenney's complaints about the modern church, pats on the back for his spirituality, and paints an Old Testament God that we should seek out of fear (not Godly fear, I'm talking terror here) not out of love. It's not popular to write a negative review on a Christian book but I'm tired of all these pop Christianity books that lack substance. This one is pure motivational drivel and that motivation stems from fear, no less. No thank you."
2,I didn't like this book,"Tenney has some interesting things to say, but unfortunately he says them in the first chapter and on the back cover. After that, he just repeated himself. Also, I felt uncomfortable with his description of the church revival service that he attended. I believe that God does great things, but the author seemed to be bragging somehow. If you want to read this book, stand in the book store and read the back cover - that's all the author had to say."
1,Can you spell H-E-R-E-S-Y?,"There's no other adequate way to describe this. If you believe in experience over Holy Scripture, consider the Bible as the ""dusty, moldy, old truth"" as Tenney describes it, then jump in!! I'm sure the passage in Matthew 7:22,23 "" 'Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you, away from me you evildoers!'"" you can also ignore!"
5,"Lord, I want to die!!","Helped me to understand the manifest presence of the Father and to know I want His glory in my life and church. I look forward to dying to self that I might see Him. If your hungary for more of His presence in your life, then this is what you've been waiting for. You won't want to borrow this one, you'll want to own it. Dripping with anointing, once you begin reading you just can't set it down for long and your back in it again. Praise God for faithful servants like Tommy Tenny."
1,The Devil loves this.,"Whenever we (the church) make emotion and 'experience' the proof of God's presence, the Devil wins again. Demons will provide all the manifestations needed to keep the party going.Meanwhile, God's program of making believers more like Christ continues."
5,Great,"I have not read the book as of yet I recently attend a women confrence,and several of the ladies were really impressed. Several book store in my area were out of this book, but I did order it, Cant wait to read it"
1,Fizzle Pop!,"Thanks Tommy. A lot more emotional basket cases for us to clean up behind you. Experience with ""God"" is not a substitute for truth. When I was young an involved in oriental occultism, we prided ourselves on the spiritual presense we felt. Now that I am not a child, I have learned that God's presense is not about a ""feel good"" experience. Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit when he went to the cross. Not a great day for Him. A great day for us. I find this book a marginal read with a confused point of view. Dangerous to the young and easily swayed. Worthless to the mature and stable."
3,God chaser or God catcher?,"Have you ever reached with your appetite for something you saw on television? Tasted a meal so vividly and you get home to find it was eaten by a sibling?Do you want God? Not the history of His path but Him? If so then you might be a God Chaser according to the author. Maybe you can find your scenario in one of the above situations.Tommy Tennney is a God chaser, I thought I was when I first picked up this book and began reading it. After reading a few pages I began to wonder what God is Mr. Tenney chasing? Early on I felt that the autor wanted us as Christians to do away with our bible and chase something else. As a Christian I need my bible it is my defense, it is my friend and most importantly it is the words of my Father.I would not recommend The God Chasers to a newborn Christian, but one who is seasoned with the word certainly will be able to separate this from that."
5,very very good read,"This book really got me back into reading. (I have been spending waaaay to much time staring at my computer screen.) Its intelligent, thought provoking and even has a good amount of action. There is alot of [...] in the fantasy/scifi section of my local barnes and nobles, and I am so glad I found this book in the midst of all the cliche novels and drab story collections. Its wonderful. My favorite story is ""Red star Prophesy"". All the stories are so different, its amazing how many talented authors can come up with stories so vastly unique when posed with the same idea. Awesome book!"
3,Interesting Read,I liked this book and I would refer it to my girls. It really rung true for me. I picked this one up with the relationship guide Stripped Bare by LaDawn Black and between the two books I think I am ready to conquer love at its best.
2,"I hear you talking, but you ain't saying nothing.","I bought this pamphlet based upon the rave reviews. The ""book"" is 94 pages and it is the size of a Jehovah Witness pamphlet. Why the publisher didn't put this in traditional book form is beyond me. The writing was tiny and, basically, it was a bunch of hyperbole--a bunch of words with no substance behind it.Basically, the author analyzes the player (in simplistic terms) and gives you advice on how not to fall for his game. A prime example of the nonsense in this book:Question: Should I be in a monogamous relationship with the player?Answer: No. Don't be monogamous. There is no legitimate reason to be monogamous with someone else who is not.Well DUH!Instead, this is the only advice you need: KNOWLEDGE is the key to not being played, common sense and intuition gives you that.Anyway, I would not recommend this book because it said nothing."
4,new British band,this is a very interesting new band. they come from near Liverpool and while their album might not grab you round the throat it certainly grows on you after a few listens. they're getting quite a following in the UK and could make it big. definitely one to look out for.
2,my father's son,This was not a good effort. Previous recordings were much better. I would not buy it.
4,Kimbrum,I loved the music. There's a classical piece that is played when they are in the house... it's dark & sinister... anyone know who the musician is?
3,Favorite Movie,I woud like to have the song that is played in the backgound of the scene when Laura and Martin go to the outside party. It is in the very beginning of the film. I think it is an 80's song; however I might be mistaken.Thanks! Anyone know the song?
4,Please! Help me!,There's a scene in this movie where Laura (Julia Roberts) and Ben are dancing a song.I wanna know what the name of the song they dance after Borwn Eye Girl.please! Somebody give me that song!Thanks.Mariana
4,To answer your question...,"The song that Julia & Ben dance to after Brown eyed girl is ""Run Around Sue"". I hope that helps."
5,an uplifting movie,it is very uplifting loved the music especially berlioz. julia is an amazing actress. i could always watch it....
3,musical score,"The clasical music you are looking for is Hector Berlioz' ""Symphonie Fantastique"". Good luck. Sorry for the low stars, I'm not that big a fan."
3,"A good summary of events, but maybe biased in Nixon's favour","Jonathan Aitken provides a good description of Nixon's early years, and this part of the book, in my view, provides the sharpest perspective on the personnality of R. Nixon. When the key topics, such as Watergate are approached, I felt that the narration lost its direction, and focused too much on conjecture. In the midst of uncertainty, giving the benefit of the doubt to Nixon might be generous, but not always justified. Nevertheless, this book is unique, and for those who enjoy this style of biography, a good introduction to Nixon"
1,Convicted Perjurer Writes Book on Nixon,"How can you possibly trust an author such as Jonathan Aitken, who served time in prison in the U.K. for perjury, to write an objective book on ... Nixon?One liar interviewing another liar.Thanks, but no.TonyTony Williams"
1,Not very effective.,"This back support didn't work for me or my mother in law, but it may work well for others. Not expensive a probably worth trying."
1,Not particularly useful,"If you have any kind of back pain or discomfort, I can't see this product being much help. It's too small, too soft, too meh to really do anything for you. If you're looking for a remedy to lower back pain for your office chair, I'd strongly recommend either a high-end ergonomic replacement or a seating solution that incorporates a kneeling chair or stability ball. For car use, maybe this is the right idea, but just the wrong model. Knowing how life-crippling back pain can be, your quality of life is worth more than the $20 you'll waste here."
1,Squishy foam - NO SUPPORT,"In addition to being hideous, this pillow provides absolutely no support, especially in the car, where the elastic straps barely go around the seat and don't hold the pillow firmly in place, so it slides around. The foam is useless, since when you lean against it, it compresses and then stays compressed (and then slides around). Unfortunately I threw away the box so I can't return the thing. DO NOT BUY."
4,Great,"I bought this to use in my car for long trips to add more support for my lower back. It works well for that. In fact, it works so well, my boyfriend kidnapped the pillow and now calls it his.The material is firm, conforms to your body and the seat well, and provides the right amount of support. The only complaint I have is the cover is a dust magnet and seems to absorb the dog hair in my car."
5,Best product of its catagory,"My wife loves this. She tried several products and settled on this. She uses this to watch TV on bed and HoMedics Ortho Therapy Four Position Support Pillow under her neck (plus a regular pillow). Now she does not complain about back, neck or shoulder ache anymore."
3,not so good,It is...just fine.Not so supportive actually and does not really help me to fight with my lumbar disc herniation.I would not suggest anyone to buy it.
2,lumbar cushion,Not for either of us. No matter how we moved it around it just would not help either of us plus was not firm enough
2,fast shipment but moderate comfort,The pillow is quite narrow so even as a petite person I found the two edges pushing up against me rather than letting me relax on it. Wish they used a slightly softer foam that allows the body to mesh slightly into it rather than having this rock hard feeling.
4,HoMedics Lumbar pillow,I bought this pillow for back support while driving. It works great for the price that I paid!
3,Not exactly what I thought I was getting,"I really like the comfort of this lumbar pillow and the material around it is really nice microfiber, however I bought it to put in my car, but the strap is to small to fit over my seat. I was hopeing to be able to use the strap because I had ruined my last lumbar pillow when it fell out of the car when I got out one night and I didn't realize until the next day. So basically if you are getting this for your home it will be great, not so great for in the car."
3,Decent support,"I am not completely blown away by this pillow, yet I have no specific complaints about it either. It is very simple and inexpensive. I bought it to use at my computer where I often get back pain from sitting too long. it's decent support but has not alleviated my back pain. However, I am also pregnant in my third trimester so I wouldn't expect it to take the pain away completely. So overall, it is decent support for the money!"
3,Good as regular pillow not lumbar support,I intended to use this as a lumbar support in my car but the pillow is a bit too large and stiff for that use. It works great as a normal head pillow though.
4,Excellent support for your aching back!!,"It is perfect if you are having a lower back pain. Its firm, fits nicely and supports your back where it requires. The elastic strap in the back helps it to fit exactly with no hassle to correct the position of the pillow. I recommend it to all who do sedentary job for most of the day."
4,Keeps lower back stable while supportive,"I read that there were issues regarding the sides of this lumbar pillow... but I like how they stabilize my lower back and keep it from moving side to side. I have had several back surgeries, the most recent one a few months ago... so I needed a pillow that could give me more support while sitting up...as well as stabilize my back from moving independently from my hips. This pillow allows me to sit on the couch without pain... sit at the computer chair... etc. I have a smaller lumbar pillow already for driving.My only complaint that it is covered with a nice soft WHITE fabric. The white will be sure and get dirty easily...but is removable and machine washable/tumble dry.I am six feet tall and around 175lbs. It fits me fine. I really like the adjustable elastic band on the back to keep in place on your chair."
3,Definitely helps back pain!,"I ordered 2 of these pillows, one for me and one for my husband. We are both very pleased with the comfort this pillow gives. The removable cover is another story. It doesn't stay ""put"". And it's an ordeal to try and rearrange it without taking the pillow out. And that is yet another ordeal I won't even go into. I think we're just going to take the covers off and use them that way."
4,Not really for the car with buckle seat,"The shipping is fast. The manufacture quality is good. But the design is not for car. It has both left and right side too thick. I had to cut half its thickness from both left and right hand sides.Different car seats may need to have different amount lambar support. For cars with captain seat, this is too much. The manufacture can use the material to make three of them.On the hand, this was not designed for car use, the seller's picture showing for some really low cost home furniture use."
2,Overrated,The cushion is too soft. Memory foam just smashes when pressure is applied. This means it doesn't really do a good job of supporting your back but it's better than nothing. This item does not come with an adjustable strap (it's elastic) which means it will more than likely not strap to your car seat and may or may not work in the office.
1,Much too narrow,"Support seems OK, but it is much too narrow for virtually any adult male, including slender ones like me. ""Wings"" dig painfully into the sides of my back. Not recommended."
5,Excellent for driving,"I have a long commute to work and was feeling lower back pain, so I tried this product. I am VERY pleased with the comfort it has provided! It forces me to sit upright instead of slumping, and is a perfect fit. The washable cover is a great feature."
3,Aparentemente funcional,"Recibí la almohada con la finalidad de utilizarla en mi carro, pero no es tan cómoda como pareciera. La he utilizado en los sillones y como almohada y me ha resultado cómoda, así que después de todo no fue un desperdicio de dinero del todo. En lo que respecta al uso en el carro no la recomiendo."
5,great for my back at work!,"I bought this pillow to use with my office chair at work. It is wonderful! It gives my back the right support, isnt too hard or too soft. Great for when youre stuck in an office all day long. I put a pillowcase over the pillow so that i can take it off and wash it at home, rather than deal with the white cover getting dirty."
3,Mixed comfort,"I bought this to use in my wife's minivan (Honda Odyssey) for a long trip. The driver seat doesn't provide adequate lumbar support. The middle portion of the cushion gave me good lumbar support, but the sides tended to put some pressure on my lower back after a while and became uncomfortable. I found it a little too thick and firm."
1,Horrible smell,"These pillows smell like they are going to give me cancer. They smell so bad that I find them to be unusable. I even washed the covers multiple times, and aired the pillows out for days on my screen porch, but the smell is deep within the pillows and will not go away. I won't be using these. It cannot be healthy to inhale that chemical smell."
3,Could b a lil better,It's a little too soft. Slightly harder would be better. Also a slightly wider one would of been better. Also do not get a white one. I was not able to find a dark color one.
4,Works well in my desk chair,"This cushion provides just the support I need for my desk chair, which has little, to no, contouring. Much easier to sit for long hours. It would be helpful for the cushion to have a means other than the elastic strip on the back for holding it on the chair, as it is not long enough to make it around my chair.May be too small for someone who is taller or bigger as the sides curve around and provide support at the waist. If you don't fit in the middle and your back hits the side edges of the pillow, it might not be as comfortable."
3,"Decent product, but doesn't work for me.","This is a well made cushion, exactly as described. But for me, it is too thick to go on most chairs, and pushes me too far forward. It might be OK for use on a couch."
3,"Okay, Not Great -- Softens Too Much w/Body Heat","Part of the design of good support is to help with good spinal alignment. The problem with this pillow is that, while upon initial use each is supportive because it starts out firm, as you use it, the heat from your body softens it up substantially. Instead of gently forcing your back into a proper alignment, it allows your poor posture to dictate the shape of the pillow. I have been looking for a pillow for my car. The weight and heat of my body flattens it out, so it now longer maintains the curved shape as you see in the photo. It does provide some sacral support, but it doesn't support posture as well as a pillow should."
4,Great back rest,"I used this on my sofa and outdoor lounge chair. It helps give support right where I need it, in my lower back. I wish the foam was a little bit softer, but it's better than others that I tried. Definitely worth the money."
3,"HoMedics Ortho Lumbar Good for Office, Less So for Car","The short and sweet of it all is that it's very good for your ""office chair"" but rather ill-designed for the car.Why? Because it's a tad too big for most mid-sized auto drivers seats. The product would be better with contoured edgesconforming to typical car seat construction. I used it three times in both a sedan and SUV but found it uncomfortable andit resided, unused, in the back seat for a month. The straight ""back"" works OK for home/office applications. Build and materialquality is good but the white cover is likely to soil quickly."
3,Functional,Use this item when traveling to reduce back and sciatic nerve pain. Reasonable back support. Cover quality only fair. Reasonable value for the dollar spent.
1,Too soft,"I had great hopes for this pillow, but it is way too soft to give any support. I have MS and have constant bad lower back ache. I need a supportive pillow for driving. This is not it!"
5,Making a difference,The lumbar support cushion has made a big difference in the way I feel. I am amazed that I no longer feel daily back pain. Thank you.
3,Works fine but needs to be a little Wider,This product works just like it should. It is soft and form fitting. There are no batteries to poke you with. It's light and portable. The price is very inexpensive compared to other car back supports. The only drawback is the pillow is not very wide and unless you are very skinny you'll overlap a bit. Thankfully I'm more skinny than not right now.
2,Not great,"I needed something strong for my back when i am sitting in a chair. After 1 week, this seems to getting softer and softer. i bought a mesh similar to the following bed bath beyond and it is lot better than this.http://www.amazon.com/Mesh-Back-Lumbar-Support-Chair/dp/B000RZNC0I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1354900433&sr;=8-1&keywords;=back+support+mesh"
1,All sex and no bite,"I was under the impression by the book jacket that this was indeed some kind of interesting mystery novel. I was wrong. I was just a collection of erotic nonsense strung together with a plot that never made any sense.This book just feeds negative stereotypes of gay men having too much money, too much free time, and only on thing on their minds."
4,Bella Luisa Radio Control Boat,"Great RC boat for young kids - it was a gift for my son's 10th birthday. Dual props make it fairly quick and manueverable for a little battery powered boat. Charge is good for about 30 minutes of run time so an extra battery is a good idea. Best for use in calm water (ponds, swimming pools, etc.). My kids take it on our family boat and play with it in quiet coves while we're stopped to sun or break for lunch.It's a fairly durrable little boat that we've had for a few years, but its not set up to have parts replaced - so some care is required."
4,"The Bella Luisa is pretty, detailed and fast",This boat is great and priced right. Its looks are much more scale model than toy. Very fast. Good radio system. Only wish you could charge the battery without removing it from the boat.
3,Fun that didn't last,"A beautiful boat that was fun to play with on several occasions one summer. By the next summer it was dead. BTW in case you're wondering, it's plastic, not wood. I couldn't find that in any of the descriptions or reviews."
2,Not as expected.,"I was a dissapointed, since the actual singers are not Billy Joel or Elton John as I thought they would be. They were some little known singers.I should have realized it from the cheap price. It would have been nice, if that were made more clear."
4,Friedemann Delights,I'm not sure why others have given this recording such poor marks. It's refreshing and a delight to listen too. I would recommend this CD above many others that have received 5 stars. I guess it comes down to whether you like chocolate or vanilla. It's too bad it has been discontinued. I think Friedemann got a bad shake on this one!
3,Feeding the Whole Family,"I didn't realize that so much of it was dedicated to baby food! I have tried a couple of recipes, and they were good. I also found the general information helpful. I am making a change in diet due to illness and am searching for the best recipes available."
3,Good for familes but not babies,"This is a good book if you are looking for recipes for a family, however, I thought that it was lacking in recipes and information as first solids for babies (which is what I expected). I think it's it great for families with children 2 years and older. The recipes are focused on adults first, then younger children, then babies. So, if you are looking for recipes exclusively or primarily for babies-- this is not the right book."
2,Was recommended by Veganmom and it is not Vegan,"I was a little disappointed to find out this book was not vegan. It was recommended by Veganmom and the fact that it was a whole foods cookbook made it seem like it was Vegan. Nonhuman animal flesh is not a whole food unless you are planning on eating the skin, hair, feathers or scales and every other part of the animal. This is not a true whole foods cookbook. I actually purchased it for my sister who is raising my nephew a vegan she seems to like it. If you do not mind the mention of dairy, eggs, and nonhuman animal flesh it's O. K. I personally would not have bought it had I know it contained recipes with nonhuman animals in them. I just wanted to warn the prospective buyer that is mislead into purchasing this book on the pretense that it is a true whole foods cookbook."
5,Inner peace and satisfaction starts here...,This is a book to practice not just to be read. The wording is carefully chosen to calm our minds and to bring our inner awareness and enlightenment.This is my 2nd book of Tarthang Tlku who speaks in a religion free base. It is a very useful book to help you enjoy and feel alive like nothing else.
2,"Great performance, horrible recording.","You can read all of the other reviews pertaining to the music. For me, much of the enjoyment of music is the live quality, especially with latin percussive music. To have that quality ripped away so the producers can have fun with their compressors and roll of the high end with their EQ's is just sad. I was listening directly off of the CD. Sounds like an mp3 set to 96 kbps or worse. Maybe he was poor back then and recorded this on a cassette? Sorry to be a Debbie downer, but the only way to listen to this is in the background with lots of people talking and laughing all around you, or maybe driving. I said my peace."
5,Jumpstart!,"People who do not even like this kind of music like Jesse Cook's music. If ""jumpstart"" does not make your toe tap and do a chair dance, then you have no pulse!"
5,Beautiful music!!,I was happy to get this music. I heard Jesse sing for the first time & went to my computer & of course went to Amazon where I find most anything I want! I ordered 3 tapes of Jesse Cook. Thanks to all the businesses who seek out Amazon! Prompt service @ a great price! Thank you!
5,Excellent,I've been buying and listening to Jesse Cook's music for a few years now after reading some of the reviews and now have every CD and DVD he's released and plays like the worlds best Flamenco guitarists ... Excellent .
5,"Tempest ""Greatest hits""","I'm into rock and all that, but i'm also into Jesse Cook! i grew up with him, and now that i'm older, i have grown to have an appretiation for his music. He amazing,most of all in his abitility to play the guitar... I just resently went to see one of his concerts, and it was amazing to actually watch and experience him play that thing, this cd tempest, is a great cd, Tempest, and Gravity i would concider to be his ""greatest hits"" albums, you can be into ANY kind of music and still LOVE Jesse Cook, hes great and Tempest displays this!"
2,Monotonous Album,"Todd Agnew's song, Grace Like Rain, is an amazing song. However the album is composed of very similar songs... same tempo, same mood, same husky voice and instrumentals. The lyrics are so-so, some are inspiring, but the music is depressing, especially after 10 similar songs.You might be better off buying a couple individual songs or a collection like Wow Hits with his best song on it. If you want a monotonous album, go ahead and spend your money."
4,Powerful album of faith,"Great songs, great heart. A little too ""cute"" on how Todd places the lengthy pauses between songs of the final track, but nonetheless a wonderful album. The title cut, ""Grace Like Rain"", is a classic. ""Romans 12:1"" is a keeper and the raw passion of ""Wait for Your Rain"" is absolutely powerful."
5,Very Awesome,I wasn't not sure about the cd when I bought it but I am so glad that I did. Talk about inspiring. His voice and everything else goes so awesome together. I cant wait for his next cd.
5,One was all it took.,"I have recently returned to the Christian Faith, and our non-denominational church plays a lot of contemporary music. On a subsequent road trip, I started paying more attention to the Christian radio stations, and discovered K-LOVE. After hearing a couple of songs that I had heard in church, I heard ""Grace Like Rain"". Had I not been driving, it would have brought me to my knees. I had never heard such a touching rendition of our old classic, ""Amazing Grace"".The title track to this album quickly became, and remains to this day, my favorite song of all time. The rest of the album is wonderful, but cannot overcome Grace's initial impact as a new listener. Todd Agnew shares the credit for bringing me back to Jesus.UPDATE: I subsequently saw Todd Agnew in concert. Sadly, his attitude is that if we don't give to his chosen charity, we are not Christians. When I met him after the concert, as he signed autographs, my wife complimented him and thanked him. He was rude and dismissive."
3,Some Good Songs,"Some very good praise lyrics are included in this album. Two of the songs are very good - Grace Like Rain and This Fragile Breath. In addition to those two, Romans 12:1 is pretty good.Most of the rest of the songs on this CD are ok, but nothing too great. If I were to do it over, I would probably get those three songs on I Tunes and pass on the album."
4,Grace like Rain,First checked Amazon.com to find this cd because of its age and when produced. Shipping was prompt; CD was of excellent quality as advertized; Purchase price was very reasonable; Would recommend the seller to anyone.
5,Great CD,Todd Agnew's deep scratchy voice is awesome. The last track is actually three songs and one of them is Grace Like Rain the rock version which is awesome. This isn't your grandma's Amazing Grace this is Biblical truth wrapped into a song filled with passion.
4,Antiquated but interesting,"The review of common phrases and gestures is thought-provoking. I now notice when someone starts a sentence with ""Honestly,..."" or adds ""by the way"" to the end of a conversation. What people mean and what they say are sometimes very different. The writer does rely heavily on Freud's viewpoints, which I think are often twisted and sick, but still very interesting. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in how we communicate."
4,Ivy Extract,"I like this product, it seems to be helping my bronchical tubes. I wish it was sold in larger quantity. One bottle does not last long."
5,GREAT MUSIC,GETTELL HAS A VERY UNIQUE AND WINTER LIKE SOUND. Ispend alot of all nighters plowing snow and his cd best describes sometimes whats going on in my head thanks Mike
4,Non-technical but intuitive,"This book is a nice introduction to the subject. A trader would benefit from reading the text more than a financial engineer would. It may be a good idea to read the author's ""Currency Derivatives,"" as well. People who have read any text at the level of Hull or higher are advised to move on to ""Currency Derivatives"" directly."
4,Do the Math,"I used this CD to learn new concepts in my math classes. It is one of the few products which covers math concepts for 5th -8th grade. The kids loved it. Even though they like to act older, they are still children and they are motivated through music."
5,Finally...math is fun!,"If you're like me and wonder how to convey math to your kids or other young people without them looking at you like you're really, really wierd, here's the answer! A fun but well-crafted and presented album of the most clever songs one could wish for. And the album art -- including a cover by a 5th grader -- will encourage kids to give it a spin. Just terrific!"
5,Timeless...,"It's hard to believe that this album is ten years old (at this writing). It remains a favorite in my collection (I even bought it again when my first copy was stolen). Wonderfully evocative nature-painting music with a new-age twist (although it remains firmly grounded; not too etherial). Particular standouts include ""Yosemite"" and the moving ""Requiem For Hetch Hetchy"", which honors John Muir, one of my heroes (I once listened to that one while standing on the Hetch Hetchy Dam itself!). Fact is, there really isn't a weak track in the entire compilation. Definitely an example of the ""Narada Sound"". If you like this, try their Christmas album!Fairly ""lightweight"" music, but enjoyable nonetheless. It will likely become one of your favorites too..."
2,Not what I expected,"I have long enjoyed Narada collections (especially the many that are themed around the winter/Yule/Christmas season) and had high hopes for this one. I was expecting beautiful instrumental pieces composed for children, to be listened to by children, to bring a sense of wonder to children. Instead, the tracks are just synthetic and not engaging (despite all those intriguing titles). My daughter(5)was disturbed by the use of this cd as background music and wanted it turned off. Perhaps I misunderstood the intended audience, but even as a collection for adult ears, it falls flat."
5,Bravo! Magnificent!,"This cd is the greatest. I really thought I would never hear those old songs again, sung the way they were intended to be sung. The band is great also. My kids even fell in love with it and bought their own! Now that's a compliment! Thank you Ms. Krall."
4,Bravo Ms.Krall !!!,"I'm crazy about Sinatra for the way he put his soul in everything he sang, you'll just end up 100% sure he meant every single word in his song. I had been searching for female equivalent of his magic. And I think I've found it in Diana Krall. Just listen to the emotion she devoted to ""When I Look in Your Eyes"". Or for straight comparison with The Chairman listen to ""I've Got You Under My Skin"". We're probably witnessing a truly great star in making here, folks !Go buy this CD ! Put it in your player after a long day in the office, dim the light, relax and enjoy the Krall treatment."
5,Great songs performed by a wonderful singer!,"The most wonderful thing about Diana Krall, that she sings from her heart. Thank you Diana for this wonderful performance........."
5,"""DOING WHAT SHE DOES BEST""","JAZZ COMES IN MANY SHAPES AND MANY DIFFERENT FORMS. SOME MIGHT TRY TO LABEL OR CATAGORIZE HER, BUT WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT SHE'S NOT TRYING TO BE ANYONE BUT DIANA. SMOOTH AND SUAVE, HER VOCAL STYLINGS TOUCH ALL THE COLOR'S OF THE RAINBOW. THAT COMBINED WITH HER ARTISTRY OF THE KEYBOARDS MAKES FOR A LOVELY MARRIGE. DONT TRY TO COMPARE HER TO ALL THE PAST GREATS OR SAY THAT HER MUSIC IS NOT JAZZ. GIVE HER CREDIT FOR WHAT SHE DOES BEST. SHE IS TOTALLY JAZZ REGARDLESS OF WHAT BM. PRAISWATER OF PASO ROBLES CA, OR B. BIGGS OF TOLUCA LAKE CA. MIGHT SAY. SHE'S DOING HER THING. AND I MIGHT ADD QUITE WELL!"
5,"sensual, skilled, soulful and seasoned","As a jazz singer myself, I never believed that anyone could truly take a song and turn it upside down, leaving one breathless, except for the late Betty Carter. Then I heard Diana. Her playing and singing on this album, as in the previous ones, absolutely takes my breath away!!! Diana 's rendtion of ""Let's Face the Music and Dance"" is brilliant. All the cuts have Diana's unique brand on them. The interpretations blow me away! I can't think of another musician who deserves the success s/he has. Bravo. Anyone who doesn't check out this CD should have his ears examined.Barbara Kelly, Siobebop Music"
4,Cut the strings!,"I love Diana Krall (her ""Stepping Out"" album is my favorite), but I prefer the trio to the orchestra and strings that pop up much too often on this album. There's some great stuff here, especially her takes on ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and--a personal favorite--""Pick Yourself Up."" I don't know if the strings and orchestra are an attempt by her label to ""popify"" DK or what. As far as I'm concerned, the sound with the trio was/is perfect and there was no need to tinker with anything. In any case, strings or no strings, horns or no horns, it's still a pleasure to hear Ms. Krall's sultry vocal on ""Do It Again"": ""Mama may scold me/'cause she told me/it was naughty, but then/please, do it again."" Ooh-la-la. Maybe this disc will grow on me, but for now I prefer the overall sound of the first four albums."
3,Not Bad But Nothing new,"Krall sounds fine but the material has either been done to death or nothing new was added by her artistic endeavors. Examples being Cole Porter's ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and Harold Arlen ""Let's Fall In Love"". She doesn't top Frank Sinatra on the former or Margaret Whiting on the latter. She isn't bad--just passably compentent!"
4,LA CALIDEZ DEL JAZZ A FINES DE SIGLO XX,"DIANA KRALL RECREO EN ESTE ALBUM LA MAGIA Y LA CALIDEZ DEL JAZZ CANTADO, CON LOS TOQUES TIPICOS DE LAS DECADAS DEL 50 Y 60, DEMOSTRANDO A LAS PUERTAS DEL SIGLO XXI QUE AUN SIGUE VIGENTE COMO EL PRIMER DIA. LOS ARREGLOS ORQUESTALES Y EL ACOMPAÑAMIENTO HACEN DE ESTE ALBUM UN EXCELENTE TRABAJO DONDE LOS TEMAS MAS TRADICIONALES CUANTO LOS MENOS CONOCIDOS O NUEVOS, VAN ENTRELANZANDO UNA GAMA DE SONIDOS QUE CONFORMAN CLIMAS ESPECIALES PARA OCASIONES ESPECIALES. VALE LA PENA COMPRARLO Y CONVERTIRLO EN UNA INMEJORABLE INVERSION. UN CONSEJO...PONGALO EN SUS CLASIFICADORES DE CD'S JUNTO A CASSANDRA WILSON...AMBAS SON PARTE DE UNA MISMA HISTORIA"
3,great but disappointing,"This recording is not up to par with D. Krall's previous two. The band really cooks on the numbers that do not include orchestration. Unfortunately, the orchestrations, while very professional, sound phony and IMHO do not enhance what Diana Krall and her terrific trios do best: swing!!"
5,I love to listen to this when I am resting and relaxing!,"This is the best CD I own, hand's down. It's mellow mood, and sultry lyrics are so calming and at the same time energizing. I adore it! I have to say that ""Popsicle Toes"" is my absolute favorite. Actually my Dad purchased this CD and he made me a copy because he thought I would like it. I didn't even listen to it for a year, because I had a lot going on in my life and then I moved and misplaced my CD case. I finally found it about 6 months ago and decided to give it a chance, and I am so glad I did. I would be very upset to lose this CD again. Anyone who buys it will be glad that they did."
1,"Choppy singing, tentative vocalist","This CD is nothing to bother about, she's clearly overrated in talents and looks. Her balads are merely OK but the moderate tempo songs she always sings choppy and never connects her phrases. It's too staccato and short sounding. Not easy to listen to at all. Don't recommend!"
2,What's the fuss about?,"I try to like Ms. Krall, but for the life of me I just can't see what all the fuss is about. To me she just seems rather boring. She's the kind of vocalist you'd find singing in the cocktail lounge of big hotel. When she finished a number, people would clap politely and go back to their conversations. If you're a ""smooth jazz"" fan, aka Easy Listening, you'll love Ms. Krall."
5,Just add candles,"This is not one of those cheesy ""romantic nights"" CDs. However it will serve the purpose very well. A friend of mine first purchased this CD as a gift to send to his father in Australia. He listened to it, loaned it to me, sent it to his father, and his mother loved it so much she took it for her auto. So now between us, we have purchased 5 copies. It is great music for all kinds of settings. I love to sing along when I am stuck in traffic. It puts a smile on the faces of those around me. She has a exceptionally pasionate and sexy voice."
4,She's Everywhere!,"All of a sudden, it seems, Diana Krall is everywhere. On T.V. in her own lyrical special, being touted by many jazz musicians, espically pianists, in magazines and union material, and now opening for Tony Bennett. And for good reason--this woman has the looks, the voice, the style, the musicianship at the ivories that takes us back to the 40's a la Lena Horne.Smooth as silk with that just right jazz edge, Ms. Krall delivers that 'lil bit of smoky, sensual sound with 13 tracks on ""When I Look In Your Eyes"". Plucky strings from Johnny Mandel snap, crackle and pop on ""I'll String Along With You"", ""Pick Yourslef Up"" and ""Do It Again"". A sassy Latin twist has been added to ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and ""Let's Face The Music and Dance"". The sticks and brushes on Lewis Nash and Jeff Hamilton's drum work are perfect with her voice, especially on one of my fav's ""Popsicle Toes"".Just look at the cover photo shot--a glimmering talent to swing, sway, and simply sexy jazz your night away to."
5,You will love this album!,"I am one of those compulsive nuts who has my radio permanently set on scan because I can't stand to listen to a song I don't like. I will never forget the day I heard the song ""Why Should I Care"" in my never ending search for the perfect song. I literally pulled my car off the road, turned up the radio and sat there in awe. I bought this CD the minute I had the chance. There is not a track on this album that is anything but great. If you are a jazz fan, and a Diana Krall fan in particular, this album will not disappoint."
4,Mesmerizing... especially hearing her live,"great cd to begin with, and live performance went way beyond it. lots of emotion and fire were added on. something noteworthy is the ""hidden track 13,"" which i think was written by clint eastwood, is my personal favorite. it brought tears to my eyes."
5,Love it!,I love Diana Krall. Her CD's are just absolutely wonderful! I love her voice and the music she sings! God bless that wonderful voice!!!
4,Relaxing pleasure.,"This is the very first cd I have ordered here at amazon.com. I was very curious about Diana Krall. Really, nobody knows her here in Holland, maybe only some die-hard Jazzfans. Anyway, I saw the front cover of the cd and decided to take al look. I read the album description; Jazz, thats new for me. I thought, lets order it!I am listening at this moment to When I Look In Your Eyes, and I feel very relaxed. That's the power of this music/cd. Diana's lush vocals are a must and I am very happy that I decided to order this cd. I like all the songs, but the hidden track is the best song in my eyes."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,"If you're looking for music to set mood, reflecting, relaxing, remembering, and just thoroughly enjoying the beautiful ""feel"" of music, you will NOT be disappointed! It is simply the best music money I've spent in a long time!"
4,"A very good CD, from a very talented singer.","Needless to say I had never listened much to Jazz music until I discovered Diana Krall. I love her voice, and her music. I liked her ""Love Scenes"", and ""All For You"" albums. This one is no exception, except that it just sounds a bit more commercial with the classical violins and stuff on the background, the other 2 CDs I own from her were more intimate and moody. Not that this CD isn't emotional or moody. It is a very good CD, with some very nice and humorous songs (like ""The Best Thing For You"" and ""Popsickle Toes""), and of course sensual songs such as ""Lets Face The Music And Dance"". Her voice is deep, soothing, and her arrangements are quite unique."
5,the best cd i have ever owned,"i happened to see diana on the ""morning show"", she played a couple of songs, they announced that this cd had been nominated for a couple of grammy's and i just loved her music. she played a couple of songs from the cd and i couldnt wait to buy it, in fact, i did within days. i've owned it now for about 4 months and listen to it almost every single night. i've purchased it for a few friends and my boss as gifts. they love it too. we all feel as if we're in a piano bar. i've been waiting for her to come to a city near me so i can see her live, and, hopefully, she will be in highland park, illinois in august with tony bennett. i cant wait. i would recommend this cd to anyone!"
5,Dianne Krall,"Great. There are no other superlatives. Dianne Krall with her trio excel themselves on this disc. She sings effortlessly and the end product is superb. I rate her up with Fitgerald, Vaughm etc.Listen to 'East of the Sun (and West of the Moon) - sheer bliss."
5,Wonderful!,"I recently discovered Diana Krall... I'm so glad I did! She has a beautiful low voice... just right to croon out those great jazz songs. Some songs have some suggestive lyrics, especially ""Popsicle Toes"", but over all not bad lyrics... Wonderful romatic crooning music.. Diana Krall is so talented! The same feel as Billie Holiday! Diana Krall, keep the cds coming!"
4,She's a true gem to listen to,"...and if you haven't seen her live, you really owe yourself an evening with her. Her music is simply magic and this cd only extends on the joy this woman can bring you. From the great 'Devil May Care' to the funny 'Popsicle Toes', light some candles, dim the lights, and put in this cd...trust me, you'll have a fun evening."
5,Silky SMOOTH Diana Krall,"I had been meaning to buy Diana Krall,and I finally did!She has a very sultry but silky voice at the same time,and her renditions of songs are wonderful.""Simply put""...Her voice is soft and could easily melt butter,and the butter knife along with it"
2,Definitely overrated!,"I would only recommend this cd to those who like German cabaret-style jazz. Despite the arrangements, Diana Krall is closer to Ute Lemper than to Nat King Cole. She knows a thing or two about subtlety but unfortunately there is almost no real emotion in her vocals. The lack of feeling and variety made this cd very difficult to enjoy. Krall has good intentions but for the most part she is all style and little substance."
3,this is good music?,"Okay, so I bought this on SACD due to a recommendation(SACD is superb). In her defense I am not usually into this type of music. It seems to me that this CD is a little light on the jazz, and her singing is good but not what I would call powerful. And why do I seem to think of Christmas when I hear these songs? I must say that this CD makes me what to sleep, I guess its not for me. To her credit she CAN sing and it seems like she has a classic style. Too bad it bores me. If you're into SACD, I like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. Slow jazz similar to this, but VERY VERY good."
5,Something for Everyone!,"I'm a dancer and this is one of my favorite CD's. I like it for it's swingin' music and the way the ballads are mixed into it. It has given me a new appreciation for ballads.Too many musicians really can't swing so ballads work for them and that's about all they can tackle. There is nothing worse than ten or twelve ballads angonizing over failed love!Later gaiters,Brad"
2,Puh-leaze,"Enough already. This has got to be the most overrated album by the most overrated artist in history. Yes, the music is pleasant, but Ms. Krall cannot hold a candle to several present day female vocalists -- Madeline Eastman, Abbey Lincoln, and Carol Sloane come immediately to mind -- let alone greats of the past like Ella, Sarah, Billie, Sheila Jordan, and Chris Connor. And her piano playing? It is competent, at best. Check out Jessica Williams, Renee Rosnes, or Eliane Elias for some real contemporary female talent. I think it is wonderful that so many people have discovered jazz through Ms. Krall's work. But if you are one of them, please take the next step and listen to some of the artists listed above."
1,Where's the Captian???,"Diana Krall's voice sounds like Tennille of the '70's duo, THE CAPTIAN AND TENNILLE."
2,"Yes, let's face the music","I really wanted to like this CD--it got such great reviews. But maybe you have to REALLY love jazz music to enjoy it. Diana's voice is not extraordinary, but it is interesing. Natalie Cole's Unforgettable is a much better investment."
5,Da Bomb!,"I happen to see Diane Krall performing on some show while channell surfing on a Saturday morning. I was hooked from the first song I heard her singing, but had to listen to two more songs to find out who she was so I could buy the CD. I immediatley went out and purchased it. When I heard it had been nominated for Grammys ""Album of the Year"" I was in total agreement."
4,No better way to unwind,There are tons of reviews out there for this CD. I just wanted to add that there is not better way to relax than to sit on a deck or patio in the summer with the beverage of your choice and this playing in the background.
4,Supper club jazz at its best,"This is supper club jazz at its best. Songs are carefully selected standards, unconfronting and familiar, arrangements are slick and professional but unadvanterous. An unashamedly commercial product aimed at both lovers of mainstream jazz and adult contemporary pop. What makes this otherwise unremarkable attempt remarkable is the talent of Diana Krall. Her husky vocals, clear piano delivery, and effortless phrasing are delights to savour. She shows no sign of being overwhelmed by the ghosts of the jazz greats who had covered these standards many times before. Her style is both uniquely individual and unthreateningly familiar. There is an effortless sexuality in this young woman's voice that recalls Holly Cole, although Diana is a better performer. Her debt to Nat King Cole is implicitly acknowledged. Every blatantly commercial effort should be that good."
1,Diana's in love with herself...,"yes, and we've got the pictures to prove it! I'm a little confused- is she selling the music or the face?? What, a few risque, sassy songs, a load of pictures and we've got a winner? I don't think so at all. Spend your money on real vocalists like Sarah Vaughn or Claire Martin. Eliane Elias can sure kick a-- on the piano and she even composes tunes, too. Now THAT's versatile. Diana just sings the exact SAME way on different tunes, that's all."
3,"Great Songs, CD Needs Improvement","This is one of the CDs where each song is wonderful all by itself, but put the CD together and it's boring. Each song is finely crafted, but there's not enough variation in pace to put the listener in a slash-your-wrists mood. The only song that even tries to liven the CD up is ""I Can't Give You Anything But Love."" Overall, this CD is one of those CDs that you pull out to listen to a song or two but you promptly take it off as soon as you're through."
1,I don't understand,"I have to admit some Diana Krall cd's work nicely as easy listening, but this one just goes beyond the point of ""easy"" and into the realm of boring. This cd is bleak, and monotonous with predictable arrangements, Not to mention the instrumentation sounds pretty washed out. Also, it really puzzles me how many people find Diana Krall so amazing, and even dare compare her to greats of the past. These songs are simple, maybe that's why they're called standards, I don't know, and they're simple because it's the performer who is meant to breathe life and joy and pain into the songs. Diana Krall is just the opposite of that.Her voice is lifeless, her phrasing, liltless and uninspired .I love jazz, and I guess the reason Diana Krall is so successful is because, she is ""jazz' for people who love anything but."
2,Luke Warm,"With Diana Krall there is always much better and much worse. She is the quintessential middle of the road chick. She is difficult to hate, but difficult to like. Her voice likens itself to the warm, smoky tones of the wonderful Carmen McRae (even more so on this release), and her piano playing is definitely sub par to her musical associate Russell Malone. But you know what, buy Diana's new one because she is good for jazz. Why? Because when you add her latest outing to your Amazon shopping cart also pick-up a Nat King Cole trio album, a Brad Mehldau and some Miles Davis or whatever. Take the time explore other jazz artists. And if you do, then Ms. Krall has done more then just sing for you."
4,Almost great...,"This is a lush album, with strings galore, and overall it works very well. There are some great readings of standards (Under My Skin, in particular) and contrary to some comments I've read, the strings add a nice dimension to her performance. My biggest complaint, though, is that there's not enough PIANO on this one. Diana is above all a great piano player, and while her voice is good, as she has said herself, she's not a singer by training. Nevertheless, this is a worthy addition to her catalog. When do we get a ""live"" one!?"
5,I'm hooked!,"What a voice! This woman can sing! I bought this cd after hearing Diana sing at the Grammy's. Honestly, I'd never heard of her before. Her perfomance on the Grammy's left me wanting more which is exactly what I got when I purchased this cd! If you're looking for something smooth, relaxing and soothing, look no further! Buy this cd! You will not be disappointed!One more comment.....Jazz is not my usual genre of preference but I appreciate talent and ability. Diana has an angelic voice. I will be purchasing more of her work in the future!"
4,"Smooth, romantic, you just need a fireplace...","I'ts by far the warmest album by Diana Krall. The arrangement, her voice, the instruments, everything fall in to the right place."
4,My first Diana,"I heard this CD in local HMV and got blown away by her performance in ""Let's face the music and dance"". ""Devil may care"" has all the emotion and attitude. I also like her style in ""Let's fall in love"". These are the songs I like most.This is my first Krall and Jazz album. I liked this one a lot until I get her earlier work ""All for You"" which, in my opinion, is her best album to date. This should be given 4.5 stars."
2,sorry......,"ok. love scenes was a fantastic album. diana krall really showed her colours and her talent. i feel that with the latest release she falls short. she should have just stuck to the piano and her voice. with me, that wins. the whole orchestral bit in the background is stuffy and useless. it sounds like muzak and not much more. the two stars are for the superiority of her voice alone. finally, the song popsicle toes makes me physically ill. sorry."
2,Diana hides her light under a bushel,"I saw Diana Krall and her trio at Blue Alley last summer. It was a GREAT performance. She sang ""East of the Sun"" and then she and the trio played , jammed for a half hour. Other songs ran 20 minutes to 30 and she would only sing at the begining of the songs. It was mesmerizing. On this CD, she sings the chourus of ""East of the Sun"" and all but leaves out the piano, guitar and bass solos. The same song lasts 4 minutes; so disappointing when she can do so much better!This CD seems interesting in places but overall listless and burned out in comparison with her earlier CD's. The schlocky orchestra 1001-strings background doesn't help.She is primarily a jazz pianist, and she is being marketed as a singer. I believe the record company forces her to do this.Come on Diana, release a record of a REAL LIVE PERFORMANCE! Show the people what you can do!"
3,Nothing new . . . Heard it all before!,"Mediocre, at best. Reviewers need to see beyond the pretty face and blonde hair and really listen to this CD for its content. We've heard it before and better at that!"
4,it's pretty good,"though not as good as her nat king cole tribute album ""all for you"", i feel this is better than ""love scenes""...i especially like her rendition of ""let's face the music and dance""..her interpretation of ""i've got you under my skin"" is interesting but lacks punch...but all complaints aside, anything by diana kralll is fine by me"
3,Not her best CD,"I have Diana Krall's previous two CDs and this one comes short of both ""All For You"" and ""Love Scenes."" I agree there's too much strings in too many of the songs giving it a more ""pop"" feel than the other albums. I further agree with other reviewers who said that there's not enough emphasis on her piano playing. Her singing definitely has more wit and swing when she's active on the keys."
3,"Well, it's OK I guess...","... I've given it many listens over several months, and I still don't get it. The problem is that it just doesn't sound very interesting!To my ear it's performed and sung perfectly well but if you want to be moved there are many greater performances out there, be it in jazz, opera, classical, folk, or whatever. If you are considering buying this CD, you may love it like many others here, or you may find it rather dull."
1,Jazz DIVA?,"...please...I really hesitate to even use that word in the same sentence as Diana Krall. She's probably the most overrated jazz vocalist there is out there. Yes, she can play the piano, but we hardly hear it on this CD at all! Singing is rugged and lazy sounding, nonchalant, and the piano playing is so sparse...what's the point of even having it on this CD? It really appears as if she's wanting her ""looks"" to make up for her short-comings as an ""artist"". That's what it looks like. Probably just a marketer trying to make a buck. I personally think it's cheesy all the way round. These songs she does on ""when I look..."", she has this habit of trying to be reinventive by singing all the balads in a moderate tempo and all the moderate tempo songs as ballads to make it sound refreshing or something. Her style is nothing short of predictable and trite. Disappointing and a waste of my time. Sorry, I'm not impressed with her."
1,Another Shania Twain crossover in the making,"I think that the focus of Diana's music has shifted to her evening wear and latest hair styles. Not to mention those fabulous dresses of hers from Donna Karan as sited on her CD. She kind of contradicts herself on countless interviews where she stresses ""It all a-boat the music"" in her muffled Canadian speaking voice. After striking a pose with Vanity Fair, I see yet another Shania Twain crossover star in the making. I could bet money that her next CD will have much ""pop"" appeal. Maybe even a video to show off her new makeover. She don't impress me much."
1,Tired and lazy vocalist!!,"This vocalist sounds like she just rolled out of bed and started singing. She takes her raspyness a little too far. It's nice every NOW and THEN but every since song and phrase is just a bit too much. I don't hear her singing ""smoothly"" like others say. She sounds hoarse a lot. Why does she always sing about body parts?? ""popsocle toes"" and ""do it again"" are just a little too risque for me. I won't play them at our radio station. Whole thing is average. I'm disappointed thoroughly. She's more of a pianist than a singer-she should play NOT sing!!"
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Diana Krall isn't doing anything Shirley Horn doesn't do better ... considerably better. Johnny Mandel's string arrangements sound lush behind Horn, not treacly and pallid, as they do on this wannabe CD. Why not buy Shirley's string album, paste a picture of Sharon Stone on the cover and have the best of both worlds?"
5,Diana Krall Impressed me...,"I've never heard of Diana Krall until i rented the movie, ""True Crime."" When i heard her sing the song, ""Why should I care"", I knew this cd was for me. Another great cd by Diana is her Christmas cd entitled, ""Have yourself a merry little Christmas."" It's only a 3 song cd but the title track is well worth it..."
1,nothing special,she is a alright Piano Player but NINA SIMONE won't lose sleep though.she is a Celine Dion in training.i feel cross-over more than solid goods.her voice is a hurting thing on the ears.and the whole strings and what not don't work.shes no Cassandra WIlson.overall she is a dime a dozen.i've heard this style done time in&time again.nothing special.
1,Underwhelmed,"Though I don't normally care for most jazz music, I thought I would try this one because it was highly recommended in a favorite classical Christian education (!) catalog. I'll have to say that I was underwhelmed. I agree with a previous reviewer who said Ms. Krall sounds like a typical lounge singer in one of those big hotels, where the attendees converse, politely clap at the end of a song, and then converse again. I'm sorry, I really tried to like it. Is she popular because she's kind of pretty?"
2,What a waste,"Unimpressive. The arrangements, recording and backup are great, Diana is terrible. She has absolutely no vocal refrain. Her ability to create passion is nonexistant. I can't believe anyone would give this 5 stars, her singing is F L A T ! She was not able to hit one big note. Definately skip this one."
3,a bit of a dissapointment compared to her previous releases,"I loved her previous two CD's. This one was a little too glitzy and slow. In addition,I think she's better with small jazz group, not with violins in the background. As often happens with wonderful vocalists, their releases are increasingly overproduced as they become more popular."
5,"Wonderful, relaxing Jazz","This C.D has a few more upbeat songs in it, compared to some of her other more mellow albums. This is a wonderful Jazz album, done in a way that only Diana Krall can. Very enjoyable!! I have a copy in my car, for my drive into work! You won't be disappointed!"
4,"Oh my God, I found it in the Jazz section!","I heard Diana Krall for the first time not to long ago on The Conan O'brien show singing East of the Sun I knew immediately that I had to buy that album. After looking all over I was unable to find it and was about to give up when I figured I might as well look under Jazz and there it was. I enjoy all kinds of music but traditionally I am biased against anything labeled as Jazz (thanks to kenny-g). Diana has a beautiful voice and her music is a big change of pace for me, thanks to her I will look at the genre in a different light now."
2,A revised rating,"I originally left a 4-star review for this album here at Amazon.com. I'm a huge fan of DK, and after the first couple of listens I must've been blinded by her good looks and her past performances. But now I've listened to this CD several more times and have to 'fess up: I don't like it much. I hate the strings. I much prefer the trio arrangement of her previous albums. If you want to buy a *great* Diana Krall CD, choose ""All for You"" or ""Stepping Out."" This one just doesn't cut it. I'd give it 2.5 stars, but that isn't an option. And 3 stars is too high. Thus the 2-star rating. Sorry, Diana...I have to be honest. Lose the strings next time. Don't try to be something you're not (i.e., a pop star)!"
3,More advertisements than a magazine.,"I just started looking through this. It appears to be a good resource. A lot of the same information could be found elsewhere. I would have liked a little more detail on the specific dive sites. The author provides a few paragraphs on each. GPS info is included.I'm a little turned off by all the advertisements; there are more than one of those highly biased dive magazines. I thought I was buying an unbiased book, but I'm not sure that's the case."
4,It Did the Job,"Can't hate on this book, it's probably really helpful and awesome. I bought it for my future father-in-law to show him that I not only pay attention when he's talking, but can act on it by purchasing gifts that reflect his interests. He was very happy when he unwrapped it, and I know he has used it at least once, but beyond that I think this book has sat on the shelf."
1,Complete Rubbish,"Having read and enjoyed many of Ben Bova's earlier books I can only express my extreme disappointment with Powersat. For a man of 'vision' he has blindly trotted out every stereotype possible - the terrorist Arabs, the innocent Israeli 'victims' and the good ole US of A saving the world again. This book is a treat for any redneck neo-con but for any thinking person it is an insult to our intelligence. I suggest Ben Bova keeps to stories set in the far future because he obviously hasn't a clue about the here and now and stirring up more anti Muslim feeling is certainly not doing humanity any favours. Please don't buy this book if you've got any sense of right or wrong."
4,A Powerful Tale of Asrto-terrorism,"Imagine never having to worry about energy again. No high rising gas prices, electric bills, and no more involvement in a violently unstable region of the globe. Ben Bova's novel ""Powersat"" brings that possibility as an astronaut and business owner Dan Randolf atttempts to create the world's first solar power plant in space. Of course, such an ambitious task faces strangling odds against Corporate Oil titans, fundementalist terrorists, and even Dan Randolf's first employer and personal friend, Yamagata.This is a very intense book, filled with decent action and suspense. I would say the best part is knowing how the relationship between Dan and Jane Scanwell came together and fell apart like a constant rollercoaster ride. The only real portion of this book I didn't like was the cliched last line. Other than that, this is one of Bova's greatest books."
1,sadly plodding story with cliche Arab and Eco villains,One would hope science fiction as a gerne and Ben Bova in particular would rise above such cliché plots but apparently not in this case.Very disappointing
3,Am I the first person to read this on a Kindle?,"Ben Bova always spins a very enjoyable yarn. This one stretched things just a bit though. Another ""double-damn"" and my head would have exploded.Another MAJOR problem with this book is the way it was laid out on my new #359 Kindle I just purchased from Amazon. Many times the 2-5 paragraph for a new chapter would come out of the blue and be at the end of the previous chapter. Then you ""flip the page"" and read the first paragraph, ""Ohhhh, that's how it goes."" Then you start reading the second paragraph and it picks up where it is supposed to."
3,what else can I say?,"It's not what I expected from this author & I'm sorry to say, I was disappointed with it. so sorry...!"
4,Umm...old song,"This song is OLD!! I would like to know why they did not release her new single ""Goodbye"" (which is very good) instead of rereleasing this song? Good song though but give us some recent stuff herein the US."
1,What Could've Been and What Is Definately NOT!,"This hastily thrown-together album is an amalgam of great dMb tracks that simply don't work. In short, this is a mistake, and only buying it could superscede such a horrible decision. This album is NOT close to what the band sounds like, and at points it sounds as if the musicians have never even listened to Dave and the guys.Here's the point: if you like dMb, even the smallest bit, do not support these piece-o-junk compilated dedications. They amount to little more than no talent bums riding off of Dave's success. And might I add, they couldn't be doing a worse job if they tried.P.S. And don't just take my word for it. Check out similar reviews on nancies.org and the iTunes music store."
3,It was a power adaptor,"It arrived on time - turned out I didn't need it - gave it gto a friend.Would I order again from this company?Yes, fair price, quick shipment."
2,A theosophical guide to Tolkien,"Ellwood analyzes the general spiritual character of Tolkien's plot and characters, and uses them as starting points for meditation exercises. Whether you agree with his approach or not, he at least grasps the book well."
2,More suited for a TV Show,"The acting was below average and the main character was none to bright, but there was some decent parts in the middle. This ""movie"" would have been much better cut down to about 44 minutes and shown on TV. Not as bad it is being made out to be, but liberal use of fast forward through the filler scences will increase your watching pleasure."
3,This Highway is a trip to the guilt ridden,"I don't know why other writers were so negative.Yes the acting was dreadful but the movie kept my interest.It was great to see someone driven to shear madness.I liked DEAD END better but this was fun to watch in its own sick way.Its only 84 minutes long but there's far worse out there,believe me.A quick story about a photographer Rand Gamble kills wife Laura Putney over a japanese girl Hinano Yoshikawa.He puts wifes body in trunk to dump in Black Lake and makes his journey a living hell.Its a great little movie despite some critical coments made by other writers. YOUR CALL FOLKS"
2,Cheeeeeeeeeeeeesy,"Got this for my girlfriend off her wishlist for 5 bucks awhile back. Yep. What can you expect for 5 bucks? The movie was cheesy and it's not about ghosts, so the cover is very misleading, as others have reviewed. It's about the dude going crazy because he killed his wife. If I remember correctly. The acting was terrible. Cheesy. Not scary at all. But for 5 dollars, who cares? I'll give it 2 stars because it at least entertained us for an hour.... and the cover is cool looking (though it has nothing at all to do with the movie itself)."
1,Ever seen a ghost on a highway?,"Greg (Rand Gamble) is waiting for Yumi (Hinano Yoshikawa) in her house where they agreed to meet. He was going to break it off with her. Amanda (Laura Putney), his wife, also comes to the house knowing her husband is having an affair. She has had a private detective following him. She starts to become hysterical and fights Greg. She falls and hits her head hard on the floor, killing her instantly. He decides to cover-up the accident. He cleans up the blood and wraps up her body. He puts her in the car trunk and high-tails it on Haunted Highway.Also known as: Death Ride (2006). Running time: 83 minutes."
1,Not oven-safe,I just received this set. I was very disappointed to find out these didn't have the silicone sleeves to make them oven-safe. I will be returning this set because they can't be warmed in the oven(they'd probably melt) Just wanted to let others know what to expect.
3,We Have A Pot To ..,The Revere pots and pans we were given as a wedding gift 47 years ago were high quality and are still in use. This set we just purchased for $50.00 is a good value for the money but not the same quality we expected form Revere.
4,Cookware,"Nice collection of cookware at a reasonable price. I'm not sure why a frying pan doesn't have a corresponding lid, but I find this typical regardless of manufacturer."
5,a true classic!,I am very pleased with this set. The same set my mom has used for years and years is working out very well for me...
4,Type VII U boat,"Good information on the type VII for general information. I was hoping for in-depth details on the actual systems. High pressure air system. Medium pressure and low pressure air systems. Bilge pump specifications. Hydraulic systems. Detailed pictures form the shipyards. Hull welds, type of rods used with HY80 steel, ie. high tinsel/high carbon center with softer cap welds? steel used in pressure hull ribs. How was the 2"" thick pressure hull formed, maybe cold rolled, or pulled around the ribs with straps/cables/hydraulics and then welded or mabe even stamped? I would like to know the real how it was done. To build those boats under such stressful times with such quality is unbelievable. Those are crafts should not be forgotten. This book is great for the modeler and am very glad I bought it. I was hoping for more though."
1,Disappointment,"The Battleship Yamato from Anatomy of the Ship series has all measures that you want to know, to buit your model. And it's regarding a ship that does not existe anymore. It's the opposite of this book: We have a Type VII C to study (U-995), and this book does NOT have any decent measures of the parts of this U-Boot. It's useless to the modeler that intends to buit from scratch. This book is only interesting at the pictures part. Nothing else. A great disappointment !!"
4,An introduction and overview,"This is an excellent, well-written, introduction and overview of the Eastern Front, 1941, with regard to German policies vis-a-vis the general populace. However, the author says upfront that the book is not intended as a work of great scholarship and, as indicated by the footnotes, it is not. Megargee wrote a great book in 2000 about the German General Staff (a WWII ""must read""), and has a dream job at the U.S. Holocaust Museum. He is a top-notch military historian in the prime of his career, which is the reason I was so very disappointed with the book's bibliography. His book brings to mind scores of questions, and needs a good bibliography to lead the reader to appropriate literature. Instead, all we get is some lame ""bibliographic essay"". A definite flaw in the book."
5,Sascha Wagner's new collection of poetry is wonderful!,"It is not often that a book comes along that can give bereaved parents both hope and understanding. This is exactly what For You From Sascha, a new collection of poetry by Sascha Wagner, does so beautifully. Sascha's poems have been a soothing balm for bereaved parents for years, so it was with excitement and delight that I found her latest book containing all of my old favorites, and wonderful new poems as well. For You From Sascha will be especially meaningful for the newly bereaved, those just beginning their journey through grief, but it also gives hope to those farther along who find themselves in the muck and mire of the also difficult later grieving stages. This is a book to read and reread, enabling the reader to find solace, light, and love from Sascha, even in the darkest hours."
2,Disappointment,"I have been very disappointed by this book, perhaps because it promised much more than it delivered. First, despite the editorial comment, it does not even attempt completeness. Entire important systems, the classical Orthodox as played by Capablanca and Alekhine among them, are mentioned only in short annotations or passed over with the justification that they are ""out of fashion"" - as if I was buying this summer's swimsuit catalog! This becomes almost absurd when one finds that on the other side, there are 3(!) complete annotated games with the ridiculous 8.Rb1??! against the Tartakower. And, again contrary to the editorial claim of objectivity, a bias for Black is perceptible, not so much in the evaluation of positions as in the choice of games. I didn't make precise statistics, but Black must have scored well over 50% in the games in the book. One gets the impression that the QGD is a particularly sharp and fighting defence :-/"
2,Won't buy them again,"I was actually satisfied with how they worked up until they broke. I had them for a couple months, but for no apparent reason they split right down the middle above the nose piece. No pressure was applied, just put them on and the lense feel on the floor."
2,Great Goggles Except they split right down the middle,These goggles are great lightweight fit snugly without marking your nose. However about 2 months into wearing them without being hit by a ball they completely split right above the nose-piece making the goggles completely worthless. Many reviewers are complaining about the same exact thing happening. I will be submitting a complaint to ektelon as i would hope others would as well. Sadly it makes this a do not buy.
4,I use them for Handball.,"I play handball at the local rec, so I wanted something that was inexpensive, but sturdy. After using these many times, I would recommend them to any handball/racquetball players. They stay on, offer great protection, and are fairly comfortable as opposed to other pairs I've tried on. I took a hit to the right lens in one of these and had nothing to show for it."
2,broken after 3 uses,"Great glasses, excellent sweat protection, they stay put and visibility is outstanding! But....pulled them out of the bag and the lens was cracked down the middle. Less than half a dozen uses and no impacts to the glasses. Will see how the replacement/repair system goes..."
4,"Goggles protect eyes, make nose sweaty","I definitely feel safer when I play racquetball. They fit very comfortably and I forget I'm wearing them sometimes. They allow little to no sweat in your eyes, but that's because it angles all the sweat onto your nose. After 20 minutes of playing, I have to stop and wipe the outside of my nose. Then every rally after that. I don't mind that much, but I'm considering the headband option so that will catch more of the sweat."
3,Simply OK - not great.,"Fit is not great for me. Uncomfortable around the ears and nose and, if ever scratched, are worthless. I would like a harder surface and better smoothing of the main contact points."
1,Never Delivered,The product was never delivered. Nobody had the courtesy to contact me to explain any difficulties.
5,Excellent,"Very good racquetball glasses. Don't fog, well vented. Had this brand before and liked them a lot so was happy to buy them again"
1,Not Well Made,I ordered 2 of these hoods (in addition to two of the 72mm hoods) and all of them arrived with the rubber part already halfway detached from the mount. I never even had a chance to get it on a lens.The two parts couldn't even be snapped back together as the rubber part was just slightly larger than the mount. Very disappointing!I've requested a full refund.
4,love it,the bra isnt the perfect one (if there is one out there) so it doesnt get 5 stars. but i really like it. comfortable yet supportive. a staple in my everyday life.
3,"Good fit, tends to fog up","Slight glare with shots off the back glass, tendency to fog up after a couple games...even tried using RainX. I would rate average at best."
4,Great New Orleans sound...,"This was a great CD to introduce the pre-schoolers I teach to the various instruments used in Dixieland jazz. The musicians are consummate, inventive, and best of all, FUN! Toe-tappin', body-wigglin' music for anyone."
2,"Some good advice, if you can ignore the militant tone","I was searching for a breastfeeding book that would offer lots of practical advice. Jackman's book does provide advice but its couched in plenty of ideology and a militant tone that isn't super helpful. He presents info in a way that is sure to make some mom's feel guilty if they supplement with formula, use a pacifier, or pump regularly. Because I intended to go to back to work 6 weeks post-partum and would very likely do one of the above, I was offended by his tone at times. The other thing I didn't like about this book is the author will frequently say things like ""I think its better..."" or ""I don't think that's necessary..."" I felt like - I don't give a crap what you think, I was to know what the evidence suggests. When I asked the lactation consultant about this book, she said Jackman is a ""lactivist"" who offered some good advice but not always in a way that's sensitive to the diverse situations mom's find themselves in."
4,Good info but author has agenda,The book gave lots of very helpful information. The first few chapters are a little intense with the way that the author describes how formula companies have brainwashed people into using their product and these chapters did not help with any breastfeeding concerns.
5,Wonderful discovery!,"If you enjoy Pat Metheny's brazilian-influenced jazz albums, Nando Lauria is a must."
1,Avoid this CD!,"Beware! If you're buying this CD to hear the three ""rare"" tracks (Everyday, The Letter and You're the One I Love) that don't appear on any other JT release, please note that these are NOT performed by James Taylor! The song Everyday is NOT JT's cover of the Buddy Holly tune, it is a different song, and these 3 tunes are performed by an unknown (mediocre) singer whom I cannot identify at all. The remaining 6 tracks can be found on the ""Original Flying Machine"" CD, rendering this CD release completely useless."
1,Ripped off!,"While visiting a store in British Columbia, I came across a JT album that I had never seen. I was so excited to think that I had run across some rare or unreleased songs by one of my favorite artists! The title of the CD I purchased is The Letter, but it has the exact same song list as Listen With James. I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer who says to AVOID buying this CD. When the first song came on, I thought that there must be some mistake. By the time I had heard three songs, I was mad. The first three songs on this album are definitely NOT SUNG BY JAMES TAYLOR! This album was produced by Prestige Elite Records Ltd out of Holland in 2005 and distributed by United Audio Entertainment Ltd. It shows a modern-day photo of JT and the entire packaging is deceiving. How can they get away with this type of misrepresentation?"
2,Only for serious collectors.,"This CD is actually James Taylor's first recordings with The Original Flying Machine (original album on Euphoria Records pre-eponymous Apple record) way back in 1967. Some songs (strange sequencing being it is the first three tracks that are non-JT lead vocals) are sung and/or written by Danny ""Kootch"" Kortchmar (although JT's guitar is impossible to miss even on those cuts). Interestingly, it is those cuts that make this a collector's gem (for those who might care). The Kortchmar cuts were never included on the original album and were only later available on vinyl on some records that were of dubious origin. For those who would want them (collectors/complete-ists) some of these songs are actually pretty hard to find on CD. I myself would have preferred it was called James Taylor And The Original Flying Machine for clarity and to keep from upsetting the masses."
5,Significant insight humor. A scholarly work as well.,"This work is a serious analysis of the feminist movement and includes references to over 180 scholarly works. This is the best book I have read on critical insight humor. Unless one is familiar with this book (see also Patai & Koertge's Professing Feminism and C. Sommers Who Stole Feminism?) one cannot understand feminism. They are quantum leaps above other books on the subject. The authors are also refreshingly honest, critical and courageous in criticizing Women's Studies teaching in the University."
1,Not a good product for my hair,"I purchased this product after hearing so many great reviews on african american hair. My hair is a combination of 3b, 4a-b-- but doesn't do well with these types of rollers. Relaxer or no relaxer, my hair turns out either too frizzy and I have to eventually flat iron it to get it descent, or it turns out really limp. Not a good product for me, maybe it works on different hair types. I will probably sell my product."
5,Gentle curls,"I love this product and the lasting results. It is so gentle on my hair. I bought two, one being a Christmas present for my neighbor who had recently had a very bad perm, and she agreed, makes the set last while not futher damaging your hair.If you are sleeping in curlers, sleep no more. This product is for you."
1,Junk! Two broke after less than 10 uses,"The first one of these I received broke after 2 uses. Target.com quickly sent a replacement at no charge, and now that one has broken after about 5 uses. Very frustrating, because otherwise it seems like a good system."
2,Did not last long,"This was a great product for the price, but within 6 months the product no longer works. Don't know why. I would rather pay more for a better product."
1,Hated it!,"I had an old Caruso molecular setter that finally conked out. I thought the ion feature of this would be great. The clicking is annoying, but if it worked, I wouldn't mind. This puts out WAY less steam, causing the amount of time it takes to heat a curler much longer than the old system. Then, after all that, it only curls about 1/2 as much. So, it takes longer for less curl--not worth it. I hope I can get another Caruso, but I hear they have problems now, too. Ahhhh, remember the good old days when things worked!"
3,Decent,"This really isn't the best choice for body wash, or else use soap with it. While the smell is great, it really doesn't last very long, nad not just because the wearer would get used to the scent."
2,"I would not, could not, with this Axe","If you're a manBeware this AxeAll nicely wrappedIn reds and blacksThere're better onesThat you can chooseThan ""Touch"" - a redAnd fruity oozeFrom the bottleComes a floodOf bright red stuffThat looks like bloodMy husband lookedAnd said ""Oh God!Keep that red goopFrom my bod!""Made for a man?Surely they jest?More like aZombie horror festAmanda Richards, April 15, 2009"
5,Good Value,Expensive but worth the money because it does engage our 4-year-old and keeps her entertained for more than a few minutes. The crystal ball puts on a neat light show and forms animals and letters. The Quizard dog and the Magic Mirror each have their own unique voice/personality which I find amusing. I recommend getting extra cards/cartridges to extend the play.
1,JUNKKKKK...,The only good thing about this toy is that i got it on sale... thank god for that... this toy sucksssssss...unless i had a defective one this is very frustrating... i too was caught by the reviews... it does not tell the child when he is incorrect... it gives the wrong facts for the wrong animals... it does not read the cards... i put in a dog it says the cow... :-/ its horrible... i would return it but its not even worht that hassle... think long and hard before you buy this toy... i fell in love with it right away but now im soooo disappointed... i have it on the junk pile... :-(
4,"Very good, but not as good as Age of Empires II","Very fun real time stratagy game, but I would recomendAGE OF EMPIRES II: THE AGE OF KINGS over it any day."
3,Sooo sweet!,Grapes are very sweet. Adding more Grape Juice Concentrate to sweeten the juice is overdoing it. I wished Kedem would stop making a good product bad.
3,Very Informative,Well written and well organized. Very helpful if building large houses from stone. To much information if you only want to build a small cabin. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to acquire broad knowledge of stone masonry.
4,good book from an experienced mason,"This book was great (except for its lack of color pictures). The stonemason showed a great many illustrations of stonework - ranging from walls, restoration, and arches. I think it was a good introduction to the fine art of stonemasonry."
2,"Good, but better options available","While a good review of proper stoneworking, I felt that the author put too much ""art"" into this book and not enough science. There are some very nice ideas for building with stone, but this is not a book I would recommend for someone just starting out."
2,"A good book, but would like to see more subjects & detail","The book wasn't bad, but I felt was did not include enough variety. How about detail on putting up flagstone, or putting rock on an existing wood frame house wall... Still an interesting book and includes some neat info."
5,Totally awesome!,I've actually seen them live a couple of times because they're from Seattle and they are totally awesome. I would recommend this cd to anyone. Their songs are catchy with a hard rock edge and Ryan the lead singer is totally sweet but when she hits the stage she rocks really hard!You will not be unhappy with this cd!!
2,Don't Bother,"I'm very dissapointed in how much I paid for this product. They don't really teach you how to sound out letters. It's more of a review if you already know the sounds. My four year old watches the Leap Letter factory over and over. He didn't even make it through 20 minutes of this one. The music sounds like a child choir, and doesn't sound varied. Each of the 3 levels are the same, slightly different concepts. No new idieas with new concepts. I'd say this DVD is worth about $10 not $30. if you want a couple good videos, go with Leap Letter and Leap Word factory. THEY are outstanding and less expensive. Only $9.99 at Target. My boys (4 and 6) can't get enough of the Leap Frog series."
4,Great way to start your child into Phonics and Reading,"This DVD it is working so far very good for my child. He was having some trouble with phonics and Sounding the words. I feel that the price may be a little to high and would be nice if will have more words, but I think it is a good way to start Phonics and Reading. The songs are a good way to encourage learning while having fun, and I love the part that sings ""I can read"" making a great encouraging and positive motivation on him. So, You should never underestimate the learning of your child, my son is five and he likes to watch the 3 levels over and over."
1,complete waste of money,"What a disappointment - this video teaches nothing; it moves too fast; it's ""extras"" are a rehash of the songs and a non-existent game (it has 4 - that's right, 4 - words for the kids to spell. Over and over); and it wasn't interesting enough to engage my son for more than a few minutes. Don't waste your money. Try Leap Frog or Word World instead."
2,Confusing,"Plot description on this book's Amazon[.com] page. I felt this book went on too long. There was something not quite ""right"" about some of this story. If the dead twin, Helena, was pregnant, why was she drinking for two months? You get bits and pieces of parts of the story and it just starts to get annoying. And to top it off, Davin, the son, gets lost on the ski slopes--big rescue, couldn't they come up with anything different? Not a book I would keep, I'd just pass it on."
5,Great book. very revealing,Medals of Blood is one of the most interesting books I have read in a very long time. It tells the reader of the horror behind war and the effects it leaves on a soldier. It also reveals the more believable side of ths US Special Forces. They have been painted as heroes who never do anything wrong. This book shows the reader that even America has its share of dark secrets. There is a sense of reality being hidden by a cloak of fiction that makes you wonder if this book is more of an autobiography of the author rather than fictional tale. ????? I would highly recommend this book to all.
3,"Good, but not what I was expecting","I love Ricky Nelson, I just wish there was a little bit more of him solo instead of with the group."
5,Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway,A great book with a huge amount of information. Ideal for me as I live on the other side of the world and this has given me a great platform to build up my knowledge on the Burlington Northern Road.The quality and amount of Photos in this book is fantastic and a perfect resource for my model railway. It is easy to read and well made with good quality paper and hard bond cover.A must have book for thoseinterested in this rail road company.
5,beautiful work...,"This is a terrific album-very melancholy with kind of a dreamy, surreal type feeling to it. Leader Vini Reilly is a much neglected musician and a vastly under-rated guitarist, mind you his subtle playing requires some repeated listenings to really appreciate. LC and The Return of the Durutti Column are equally mellow and dreamy."
5,Ask like a litte kid!!,"A friend of mine gave me ""The Prayer of Jabez"" and told me it is one of the best books she ever read. So I read the book expecting big things, and big things I got! This book told me that God wants to give us what we want and if we ask we will get it. I loved how the book made me forget that asking for what we truly desire is not selfish. This book made me pray harder for my greatest desire: to be a Christian singer and show people the light in the dark when there appears to be no way out. That is what I want to do for God. So read this book and be greatly inspired by a little man with the right idea!"
2,How I felt about this book,I didn't enjoy this book because it talked about how to please yourself. The book was suppose to be about bettering yourself but you seek God everything will be added to you.matt.6:33
4,A solid beginning,"Good information and guide to beginning the tabla. A very good starting place, but you can't learn without a teacher, not if you really want to PLAY tabla. In this day and age it is time to include a short DVD or CD-Rom to at least help with beginning strokes so the beginner knows what it sounds like and this author could do it to help beginners over the initial growing pains."
1,wate of money,"This is a book for someone just starting out... most information you can find it on the web for free, truly waste of money."
3,Very Basic,"This is an extremely basic overview of the tabla. It reminds me of early mel bay method books for band instruments. I had already taken six months worth of lessons so this didn't really fit my needs. I would strongly recommend learning tabla from an experienced teacher because if your technique isn't monitored from the beginning, it can be difficult to get out of bad habits. Once the basics are in check, I would recommendFundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1"
2,The basic,"Its a start, the basic, begining to the tabla but I think a video or dvd is needed to really understand some of the complexities of tuning and playing of the tabla, the CD is lame and of no help."
5,best single by far by CB!!!,"this song is phenomenal!!! the beat is very good, bells on!!! the zitar on the background is unheard of before.... the flaming lips on this single is a great collaboration.... the message of the song is also very good.... i first heard of this song from a friend and then heard of it again from mtv europe music 2003 awards (they're gods!).... this single reminds me of old school CB.... definitely will be a rave classic.... the song transports you ""the golden path"".... the song climaxes on the last minute of its entiriety.... A MUST BUY!!!"
5,Wishing on a Star is one the most beautiful songs ever done,One of the most talented groups of the 80's. Strong Vocals on par with Whitney and Mariah.
4,very good - versatile - the lead singer is the best ever,this new lead singer is the best they ever had. she can really blow. not the nasal sound of the other covergirls' songs. she has soul and style. she should go solo.
3,Popcorn,This book came recommended to me by a speaker at a Pampered Chef seminar. It gave some interesting facts and information on all those food topics that you've always wondered about.Some things were interesting and others are what you've seen everywhere else.This is a great book for the coffee table.
2,FujiFilm A340 digital Camera disappointed customer.,"I bought this camera a few months ago and I am very unhappy with it I can see why it was returned remanufactured cameras do not work this camera is confusing the menu is is a problem and also the the picture shakes before you can click the button it does not come into focus right away I will never buy another Fuji camera this was a waste of money you can't even get the batteries to charge the camera, don't waste your time buying this one."
5,Great bit and great price,Great bit. don't waste your money to pay for higher priced brand. This bit holds up as well as any of them. I even accidently hit a small finish nail and the bit didn't skip a beat.
4,A good single-disc collection of Chris's recent output.,"This contains a new version of ""Copenhagen"" featuring Toby Keith. All in all, a good single-disc collection of Chris's Capitol output so far. My one complaint is that it's missing ""Bareback Jack."""
4,Chris Ledoux - 20 Greatest Hits,This was bought to give someone for a Christmas gift. The person seemed happy to get it. J. Hall
2,Sorry,"I'm going to spoil the party. But first I want to make clear my bona fides: Chris is my favorite singer of all time, I have all his CDs, I've loved his music for more than 25 years, and I was a member of his fan club for a long time (till the founder died). BUT... I am so tired of Capitol/Liberty reissuing Chris compilations (this one, best of, box sets, live, early years, rock 'n' roll collection, etc.). And a year and a half after Chris' untimely passing, it still hasn't ended (""Anthology"" and ""Ultimate Collection""). Enough! As much as I love Chris LeDoux, where does this CD come from? Greatest hits? As great as he was, he had NO hits! This is just shameless commercialism, although at least Chris' widow and kids benefit."
