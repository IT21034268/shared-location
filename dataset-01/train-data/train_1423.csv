2,"O so slow,so slow, O Clarise wear ever did you go?","I exsepted this to be simailer to Silence of the Lambs Jump right to the point!, This doesnt yes it has a lot of talking in it,, IN my opion this could go on the list of the worst sequals. It just has Starling looking again for Dr.Lecter, after 10 years she recives a letter from him!!!Why Jodi Foster! why!!! Dont get me 1 this Clarise does good but she looks younger,, I mean this is like 10 years later.Despite what many probly think I think this should be the final moive going foward in time,, I mean I think haveing Lecter thrown back in jail would be to orgianal ending after all Lecter is a very smart guy in deed.Note to the productes: If you ever consider makeing a IV one DONT go ahead go back explane more about Dr.Lecter's past before he was thrown in jail!"
2,Unbelievably Bad!!!,"I can't imagine why Sir Anthony Hopkins agreed to make this movie! Calling it a sequel to Silence of the Lambs is ludicrous. It's no suspence, all gore. If you're into seeing lots of blood and disgusting displays of cannibalism -- this film is for you. If you're lookling for a good suspenseful thriller, skip Hannibal. Jody Foster clearly made the right choice in skipping this one!"
1,It just doesn't make sense,"When this movie came out I just knew I had to watch it. I expected to see a thriller that would make me have nightmares for days. What I saw was pure crap.This just doesn't make any sense AT ALL. Wild boars? Give me a break, that is just so absurd and pointless. It's just like the old and boring Batman TV series in which the villains tried to kill Batman with the most bizarre and stupid methods. I just laughed during the entire movie.The only thing I liked? The brain thing. It actually sucked but hey, after an hour and a half of crap any change is good."
1,Not a good movie,"Save your money!Boring, blood, gut's, and no real plot.I thought Gladiator was great!Alien was great, but the director failedin this.Good try Mr. Scott, but you did not get my money!"
2,Disappointed,"The omission of character development (Hannibal, the Verger family, Starling) and changes in story line were extremely disappointing. Audio CD was much more of a psychostory. The movie stepped down several notches to a grizzly scary story. The visuals were excellent and appropriately dark, Anthony Hopkins reflected the best of his dark side. This was not even close to the story Harris wrote. Hollywood is taking some extreme artistic license in the translation. A disappointment."
2,Anthony Hopkins is good. That's about it.,"Maybe Anthony Hopkins doesn't need to try in order to scare us. He certainly makes it LOOK easy. His performance as Hannibal Lecter is again riveting and chilling. Thus ends the movie's good traits.Much has been made of this movie being relatively gory compared to the first. I frankly think people don't remember the first if they think so, but I understand. Hannibal is much more PSYCHOLOGICALLY horrifying the aesthically horrifying. But the fact is the this horror does nothing to advance the plot. It is purely there to horrify. Without a sensible plot, Hannibal is only debatably worth your time."
5,HANNIBAL,HANNIBAL IS A MASTERPIECE IT IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE GREATEST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE THIS DVD IS 2 HOURS LONG AND IT IS IN DTS I LOVED EVER PART OF THIS MOVIE ANTHONY HOPKINS IS THE TRUE BOOGEYMAN
1,Horrible,"This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. It starts with Hannibal in Italy, and Sterling on executive review, possibly loosing her career. Very slow paced. The graphic seens were good, but they really didn't come till very late in the movie. I expected so much better. Was very disappointed."
1,Trash,"Anthony Hopkins must have wanted the paycheck because this film absolutely stinks.It has the plot and story of a grade z mad slasher film.Don't waste your time or money,as I did.The worst film of 2001 thus far."
2,Bad Taste,"This is an uneven movie. It almost works. The atmosphere and music are intriguing and adequate, some moments are visually stunning and a few thrills truly engage and surprise. However, the rythm of the narrative is too slow and the plot is basically just another cat-and-mouse game with an anticlimatic ending that`s way too out there and doesn`t connect with the rest of the movie. Anthony Hopkins is again a convincing Hannibal Lecter but Julliane Moore plays an uninteresting, bland Clarice Starling that shows little sparkle. There are some genuine moments of tension and suspense to find here, though as a whole it`s too flawed and not very captivating. The baroque feel is an edgy and well-accomplished idea, creating some tension, darkness and weirdness that unfortunately don`t work very well in the end. This movie wants to be a rich banquet, yet ultimately is just another happy meal. Tasty enough, but leaves you wantig more."
2,I think this is why Ridley got passed up...,"... this movie had no tension at any point. That is what is so great about the first two Hannibal Lector films, but Ridley decided to pass that up and go for show everything attitude. Well this failed miserably. In my opinion, I don't think this movie should have ever been made. They should have just let it die in the novel. The only, and I stress ONLY, bright spot in this entire turd is how well Julianne Moore was able to nail Jodie Foster doing Clarice. It was uncanny. That's it I'm DONE."
3,Sequel does not measure up with Silence of the Lambs...,"The escaped Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) once again contacts Agent Starling (Julianne Moore), who has come under public scrutiny after an FBI operation gone bad. This opens up a new opportunity to catch Dr. Lecter for those who seek to catch him. Hannibal is a suspenseful thriller with some gruesome scenes that will remind the audience of Hannibal's psychological state long after they have seen the film. In addition, Hopkins offers a solid performance as Hannibal once again, but this sequel does not measure up with the original Silence of the Lambs."
3,not as good as the book,"I would just like to say that I enjoyed this movie, but only until I read the book. Harris is a master and the book was creepy yet compelling but this movie does the book no justice. not to mention the terrible ""Hollywood"" friendly ending. Yes it's hard not to love watching Anthony Hopkins, as Hannibal the cannibal, and I did enjoy him telling Gary Oldman to cut his face off, but it still wasn't good enough. If you plan only to see the movie then you are missing out. I strongly suggest that you run out and get the book today. You won't regret it."
2,Sick cuisine; sick ending,I give this movie two stars only because I like the opening scene featuring the FBI shootout with the gangster mother. Scott does a decent job adapting the screenplay from Harris's novel (initially titled Morbidity of the Soul). What inclined Harris to write such a grotesque ending? I'm glad Jodie Foster turned down the role. I'm also glad I rented this film instead of buying it. Hannibal has the most over-the-top sick ending I've ever seen in a film/novel. I'm also a little disappointed that Hopkins agreed to do a second sequal. Apparently he has succomed to the lust for fame and fortune that intoxicates so many Hollywood actors. I don't plan on seeing this movie again.
2,No Alternate Ending,"I was not crazy about this movie but I bought a copy of the DVD because of the alternate ending... I was fooled. Much of the hype and complaints I heard about Ridley Scott's version of Hannibal was that he changed the infamous ending that was in the novel. The DVD promises an ""alternate ending"" that I hoped was closer to the novel. In reality it is almost exactly the same as the one in the theatrical release with one change. If you are planning to buy this DVD because of the alternate ending... DON'T BOTHER!!! They are trying to capitalize on the fact that some people really want to see the ending as Thomas Harris wrote it. I was fooled by this."
3,Hannibal could have been Better,First off Moore taking Fosters place was the biggest no no in cinema history.Yes she is a good actor she just doesnt fill Jody Fosters shoes.While watching the film i just didnt feel any chemistry between Moore and Hopkins.Unlike Silence of the Lambs where Jody Foster and Anthony Hopkins scenes were almost erotic.See it for Hannibal's humour nothing more than that.We will not see any Oscars for this film.
2,"DISTRACTING GORE, GREAT DVD SET!","I watched Hannibal with a fresh mind for a new story about Dr. Lector. The movie was interesting, but, only half of the gore seemed to work. The last gory scene, where the brain is shown, sent me detouring from the story to what were the filmakers thinking???? NO GORE SHOULD SEND YOUR MIND AWAY FROM A MOVIE, BUT SHOULD BE USED TO SEND YOU DEEPER INTO IT. Gore is a tool, which is abused in Hannibal. The savers of this movie were the actors. The script wasen't very bad, but would have been scarier with less gore. Also, it wouldn't have been hard to put in a little more thought. The 2 disc set though is deeply satisifyng for special features with multiangle features and tons of trailers and posters and making of features. To leave you off with, don't watch Hannibal expecting much, and you will walk away satisfied...."
4,"Expecting another ""Silence""? Don't apply here...","""Silence of the Lambs"" was one of the great movies of the decade, complete with superb acting, a solid script, fabulous directing, and just an all-around good crew. It won several oscars, including best picture, actor and actress. The movie was chilling thanks to the greatest performance of Anthony Hopkins' career, and poignant and redeeming thanks to Jodie Foster's.But ""Hannibal"" has a different director, a new Starling, but the same old Hopkins. It has a distinctly un-American feel to it, what with the very un-American Lecter and the slimy Paul Krendler (played well by a paunchy Ray Liotta) and mishappen Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).And though Lecter seems a ghost of his former self, one gets the feeling he's gotten soft since his heyday of the great escape, there are times when flashes of his old self are visible.Overall, a worthwhile movie, with different themes than ""Silence""...don't come expecting the latter and you won't be disappointed."
2,Its Just Not The Same,"Hannibal has an entertaining story line, but when compared to its predecessor, Silence of the Lambs, it just doesn't stack up.One problem is that Anthony Hopkins acts too much like Anthony Hopkins and not the evil Hannibal Lecter we met in the first movie. This movie just isn't dark enough. It has the requisite gratuitous violence, but not the creepiness.Silence of the Lambs made me feel uncomfortable. It was eerie and dark throughout; the movie had a sombre tone. That tone is missing in Hannibal. Dr. Lecter seems to have lost some of his pizazz in this movie.It could have been better, soooo much better, but it isn't. Rent this movie, don't buy it. It is worth watching if you've seen Silence of the Lambs."
4,"Very good, but not nearly as good as Silence of the lambs.","It is a great movie if you don't compare it to silence of the lambs. The two movies are entirely different. It is very engrossing (and gross as well at times). Not too much mystery to it, but enough to keep you going. You just might not want to eat for a few days afterwards though...."
2,"large vocabulary, but poorly written","I bought this book because I am a German student, and I thought that this book would be the best. However, there is a major problem. In the English to German section, no plurals of any nouns are given. You must look the word up again in the German to English section to find the plurals. This is a huge inconvenience, and I am sorry I bought the book."
2,not in tune,"on this recording two important points are missing: a good recorder sound and a good ensemble feeling. van hauwe sounds very boring with a lot of intonation problems (listen fontana!). the lute is very hard and with only one color: plink.This style of doing music can not be in the international competion with the very good groups (listen girdino armonico with this repertoire!) and with really good recorder players like maurice steger, sebastien marq or lorenzo cavasanti"
5,Preventing Surprise Attacks,"An excellent buy. Book was in good condition, and was shipped in a timely manner."
5,THE BALLET MASTERPIECES,"I always loved the music of the wonderful Tchaikovsky, specially the suites on this disc; I always wanted to have these three great works in one disc and this cd made this dream come true; beginning from the outstanding and ethereal SWAN LAKE, passing for the sublime and exquisite SLEEPING BEAUTY to a magnificent ending with the NUTCRACKER (My favorite and for me the most creative and beautiful of the master's ballets); Israel and National Philarmonic Orchestras made an incredible work bringing life to these trascendent compositions. Every instrument is indispensable and the sound quality is simply glorious!!! This cd is for every Tchaikovsky's fan and for everyone who like classical arias."
1,one of the worst recordings of the ballet suites,"is this below reveiwer crazy,this is one of the worst performences of these works there is.and the sound is pretty bad to.i cant belive london recorded this performence,its one of there worst recording jobs.get zubin metas later tchikovsky disc for teldec its better played.and i think richard boyoin STINKS.im trying to figure out where this below reveiewer gets his taste from.please skip this one and get dutiot/montreal version these are great masterpieces that deserve alot better"
1,ego check at the door,"a friend of mine is a bartender at a dance hall in texas, the lead singer of Cross Canadian Ragweed ordered a beer from him and acted like he didn't have to pay, when my friend inquired about getting the beer money, the guy replied ""Do you know who I am?"" My friend, said ""No"". The guy replied, ""I'm the lead singer of CCR."" ""John Fogerty?"", my friend asked. The lead singer gave him a five and walked away. There is only one CCR and it ain't Cross Oklahomian Ragweed"" Buy Old 97's ""Too Far to Care"" for how this music should sound."
5,A great album of very high quality,I have bought most of CCR's albums which means I like them. But this album is the tops for me. It has some great songs played in a good southern rockin style with distorted guitars. Distorted like Neil Young not Jimi Hendrix that is. Dimebag and Sister are my favourites tunes but to be fair all the material is of a high standard which makes it my favourite of theirs.Shame they are no more as this type of music really rocks on stage.
4,"Man, The Weed brings it.....again!!!","Don't listen to the haters, there are always one or two ""Tweeterheads"" who can't help but try to bring everyone else down. Make no mistake, this is a ROCK ALBUM, not country, and rock it does (like they were ever a country band anyway). If you liked Purple and Gravy, you won't be disappointed. Lighthouse Keeper and Dimebag are great tunes and most of the tracks are really good. There are only one or two songs that I don't care for, but that might change after a few more spins. 10 years and it just keeps getting better every time. Keep it up boys, you got your mixture right and all cylinders are firin'."
5,Cross Canadian Ragweed-Garage,"Why isn't this group more famous? This CD is excellent! CCR is classified as Alt Country, but their sound is a combination of blues, country and rock. My favorite track is ""Blues for You"", which is the song that got me interested in them. There is not a bad song on the CD. There are ballads and there are songs that really rock. I am so glad I discovered this band."
1,Def Leppard-Lite,"I am and have been a big Def Leppard fan. This album does not rock like ""Euphoria"" or any other Lep album. It's lame. I bought it and listened to it twice. I tried to give it a chance, but I sold it at the used cd store for five bucks. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
2,too polished!,"first listen to this cd convinced me that this is no old def leppard from the 80s,which to me was disappointing.""now""did got some airplay,but its pretty ordinary song.The only thing they know now is to cry like a boy band on ballads apparent on songs like""unbelievable,youre so beautiful,let me be the one,love dont lie..etc."".only good song is""kiss the day""which is a bonus track.This song truly rocks-shades of old time here.Overall the cd is pretty ordinary & a great disappointment."
1,"Why can't they just make another ""Hysteria""??","Boy, did these guys ever lose the way. If I wanted a 'N Sync album, I would have borrowed it from my little sister. ... It seems this band can never get it right: Either they are way too hard sounding, like on ""High 'N Dry,"" or they sound too wimpy, like on ""X"".... If they created 12 tracks on par with songs like ""Scar"", then I'd still believe in them. As it stands, though, these guys are taking a much too commercial route.WELL, ENJOY!!"
2,Worst Def Leppard Album Yet,"I find one problem with this album, too many ballads. Don't get me wrong because I have no problems with them, its just that none of these ballads stand out.If Def Leppard wants to keep their younger fanbase, they better put out something that Rokks!"
1,Not this one...,"I've been a die-hard fan of Def Leppard up until this album. Just knowing that they're putting out music has been reason enough to buy whatever they release. But when I listened to this album (multiple times, just to see if it would grow on me), not a single track stood out. It still sounds like them, but their attitude seems like ""Let's get back on Top 40 radio"" instead of rock stations. Even then, most of these songs, if any, wouldn't even make the cut on a top 40 station. They said that Aerosmith's latest - ""Just Push Play"" - was an inspiration, and that album wasn't very good! I'm still a fan, though. After all, 9 other great albums says a lot."
2,Below average release,Well its 2002 are the Leps back in our face?? not exactly there are 13 songs on this release and most sound either like ballads or are very popish sounding. While Joe's voice is in peak condition I can't say the same about the rest of the guys they sound too much like a lounge act now. Thee is in fact a couple stand out tracks Now Gravity and scar. This was only a halfway decent release from these guys. While I wish it were still 1987 or 1983 for that matter I'm glad these guys moved forward with their sound. I am a DIE HARD fan of the early stuff which is their overall best output of music but change isn't all bad. I'm glad I only listened to samples BUT I may buy it used I wouldn't pay full whack for it. (the same can be said of slang from 1996 I did not buy that one either but I might used of course). Bring on album 11
2,Hard Rockers Gone Soft!,"Once again, a great hard rockin' band has gone soft. I can't understand what happens as rock musicians age, but it seems once they reach a certain age (40-50), they hang up their rockin' sound in favor of bubble gum or as it is termed in the radio industry (adult contemporary). Maybe they think that sound will sell more records. Personally, I still love to ROCK!! Amazingly, groups like the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith have managed to keep rockin' over the years. With the exception of Four Letter Word, X does not even remotely sound like the same band who recorded Hysteria and Adrenalize. I long for the return of the rockers I knew as Def Leppard!"
2,Hard Rock?,"If you want the hard rifs of the Pyromania and Hysteria style, this CD is not for you. A lot of bands change their style, something they call evolving. Def Leppard should have stuck with the type of music that made them great. Steve Clark, we miss you."
5,Very good album,"Take it for what it is, and realize that the last time Def Lep truly rocked like they did in the Pyro days was on Retro-Active.Sure, I had expected more from this cd, but with the exception of a few tracks, (namely 3,4 and 5) I liked it very well. In fact, the very last track Scar is up there with some of my favorite tracks on Hysteria.If you don't like it, you don't like it, but don't discard it right off the bat as being too soft or being a sell out, give it a good listen and enjoy the usual great musicianship by Def Lef.(Okay, I admit, maybe it's closer to a 4 star album, but it's Lep! I can't see a Lep CD w/ a 3 1/2 star average and not try to increase it.)"
3,Good Musicianship -- Average Songwriting,"""X"" won't rank as my favorite Def Leppard CD, but it has its moments. To me, the bands' albums have always had a nice balance between ballads and churning rock anthems. ""X"" seems to lean too heavy upon the slower material; even the more upbeat songs seem a little tame when compared to their past material.There are a few bright spots: ""Torn to Shreds,"" ""Love Don't Lie"" and ""Cry"" are excellent songs. On the other hand ""Four Letter Word,"" ""Girl Like You"" and ""Gravity"" are dismal musically and lyrically.I don't really see the ""boy band"" comparison some people have made -- maybe a little on ""Gravity"" but that's about it. I don't think the band would be going down that path. Typically when a band matures (Def Leppard has been at it 20+ years), the music does tend to get toned down.If you're a rabid fan, make this a part of your collection. If you're new to the band and would like to know a little more about their music, try ""Hysteria""."
4,do you expect the same album over and over,reading some of the reviews for this album hearing people say its pop crap ah its not the def leppard that started out. But do you expect the same music over and over yah they have changed but the music is still good same with the songwriting. everyone in the band is 40 or close to it how would they all look with rediculous long hair and playing as heavy as they did nothing wrong with changing your stlye of music. These tunes are better than some loud annyoing noise that lots of hard rock bands put out. Key word there is NOISE this isnt. keep going def leppard
3,better than there last 2,x is better than euphoria and slang. x does rock . I wish they would rock little harder. I hope they rock harder on their next cd. x is still a good cd.
2,Could be better...,"I'm rather disapointed with this album. It lacks the hardness of previous albums such as Pyromania and Hysteria. In anycase, I feel their older material is much better than the last few albums. I am giving this 2 stars just for the fact that I do like Def Leppard."
1,Def Leppard are GONE.,"Def Leppard have definitely sold out to pop. This is by far their worst album. Nothing but slow pop ballads, not a single hard rocking track on this album. Unbelievable...for someone who used to be a fan, this is just pitiful. I would not recommend this CD to ANYONE.Dice"
4,the Sheffield guys are back!,"I liked the this album, it has some of the same sound of 'Euphoria' but most of the other songs such as 'Now' and 'Unbelievable' are what these guys are all about, a more raw, natural sound.I think any DL fan will not be disappointed with this collaboration.And I think it shows that these guys are here to stay."
2,Def Leppard?!,"I bought this CD hoping that Def Leppard would finally come out of their writers block since the death of Steve Clark. Didn't happen. This album, among their last two, are a good reason for the band to just give it up."
1,I waited 3 years for THIS !,"I have been a hard core devoted fan of Def Leppard since the Pyro days, back when these rockers knew how to rock.I have to say I have never been so disgusted by anything in my life. Practically every song on this album is sappy, mushy, love crap that is predominant with boy bands, and that is pretty much what these guys sound like. This is not the hard rock band that gave us Pyro and Hysteria.They have totally lost their edge.As for what I am doing with my copy of this sap-o-rama, well it makes a really nice coaster."
2,Jesus Christ Guys...,"Ok C'mon guys, the lep is by far my favorite band of all time...but WHAT HAPPENED here is pathetic. X sounds more like middle aged men singing to pre-puberty girls. I listened to the album once and never touched it again. I only made it through it because I'm a die hard fan, but I wouldn't recomment it to anyone else. Ever since clark died, this band had gone way to soft. C'MON GUYS! SUCK IT UP AND PRODUCE ANOTHER ALBUM THAT HAS SOME ROCK IN IT! If you like the 80's lep, listen to pyromania, on through the night, high 'n' dry, and definitely hysteria. DON'T EVEN TOUCH euphoria, adrenalize, and especially this one, X....unless you like boy bands. *gag* *hurl*"
1,Atrocious piece of manure!,"What happened? What happenes to heavy metal? These idiots are no longer making metal. They are making pop in the vein of NSYNC and The Backstreet Boys. No kidding. Gone is all the heaviness and rock. Instead they decide they wanna make a boy band album, so they go right ahead and do it. It shows they dont give a darn about their fans (see Metallica), and only wanna do whatever kind of music they wanna. This album went right in the garbage can."
2,Very Unfortunate for Rock Fans,"Well, a new Def Leppard album? Sign me up! even if their last few albums were a little weak, I was still pleased to see a new offering. Man, was I in for a shock. Oh, the sharp production is still there, the performances are good and the sound is great. But what about the songs? Weak all the way through. The only song that STARTS to rock dies as soon as it reaches the chorus. 4 letter word? K-I-S-S? Come ON! That is so L-A-M-E. This album never takes off. It leaves you wondering what happened to the band. I guess they're trying to get in on the quick and snappy sweet world of boy band music. And what about all the songs about LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE? Wow, you'd think they were love starved 12 year old girls. This album was so syrupy-sugar sweet that I thought I'd get a pimple from listening to it. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,As Flat As It Gets,"Yes Def Leppard is continuing its slide... HighNDry was great, Pyromania was great, Hysteria was great, and then it went downward.. This album is so flat, all songs are same and non-distinct, nothing really going on there... I feel bad....Same thing that happened to Van Halen. Only Iron Maiden seems to be able to keep in real."
2,"I think already heard this album, except it was Euphoria","Hardcore Lepps fans will be disappointed again, they have lost their edge. I guess Steve really was that important! The thing is, I love Def Leppard, but all of these sappy songs just can't stand up next to all the great songs from Pyro and Hysteria. It is WAY better than ""Slang"" though.."
1,What happened to Def Leppard,"I have been a fan of Def Leppard for over 15 years. I have bought and worn out many copies of their albums, cassettes, and Cd's. I bought this cd first thing this morning. I got home and plugged it in. I was thoroughly disappointed on what I heard. I ran through the songs looking for somthing to grab me and sadly nothing did. If your into ballads this is for you. If your into rock, this is way off mark. I guess Brittany Spears producer helped with this album, if that is not an indicator? Anyway, Def Leppard sounded tired and slow on there album. Needless to say they are not Aerosmith by any sense. Aerosmith is at least still putting out jamming musica dn is still ROCK based. Please Def Leppard come back with something better. Sorry do not buy this ""X"" album."
2,I want my money back!,"I've been a huge fan since the early 80s and the Leps have put out my favorite albums time & time again but GEEZ, what is going on here? First, the cover artwork - this is not Def Leppard, this is some minimulist nothingness, Second (and much more importantly), the music. The boys don't even plug in their guitars until Track 6 - Four Letter Word. Their harmonies sound mushy in an oatmeal kinda way. There are no real gut wretching slow songs(like Love Bites or Breathe a Sigh) just blandness. Also, where's the barn-burner every album has? (And the best albums have many). Four Letter Word is the closest to true Lep-ism, granted but I expect more.Someone once compared this album to Bryan Adams and I laughed out loud and wholeheartedly agree. This is their weakest outing and even Slang as a whole is better than this. I'll be using this album on those nights I have insomnia. Zzzzzzzzz."
1,This album is a joke!,"Bottome line, if I could give this less than 1 Star I would. Every single song is horrible. Nothing rocks on this album. Someone comapared a few of the tracks to songs on Hysteria. I'd like to know exactly what songs they were talking about and I'd like to get some of the stuff they were taking at the time. Comeback album? Hardly! When are they ever going to get w/ the program and record an album that has some b@lls. Record something that matters or retire!"
1,Better to burn out then fade away...............,"Isn't there a law prohibiting 10+ ballads on a single lp? If not there should be. Fans of ""High 'n' Dry"" or ""Pyromania"" do not pay any mind to this album. Well, unless you have become ""born again"" since the 80's and traded all your metal albums in for country ones. I'm not saying ""X"" is country, rather the rock equivalent. Play ""X"" backwards and you'll catch my drift."
1,Sugar-coated Crap,"OK. I ain't a professional music critic. But I was COMPELLED to write one about this album. After all, I was raised on Leppard.How can I eloquently put this? This album is pure, total, 100%, unadulterated, dripping rubbish. Garbage.I can't compare it to any other sound. It doesn't sound like Leppard, either the hard-rocking days or the post-one-armed drummer days. I can hear several influences on the album, though. There are hints of NSYNC, Tommy Lee, Linkin Park, Chicago, Air Supply, Journey, and many other older poser chick rock bands and several more modern day teen pop rock bands. It is obvious that Def Leppard are now trying to ""change with the times."" It's apparent they are trying to blend with all the modern day shallow, one sound, no-talent teenie pop rock idiots. They're not themselves anymore. They've sold out. Making music 'cos they have to in order to eat now, not for fun. Pathetic. Really."
1,10 is less than 1,"this sucked. I became a fan when High n Dry was out. Pyromania was the best and then they started sliding.Yeah and Sparkle Lounge were much better than this.The band is fun to watch but I dont think they will ever ""rock"" like they did in the first three records."
1,Xtremely Disapointing,"After Euphoria I thought the band was on the right track, but this sounds like soft-rock material."
4,Should Have Been Between Pyromania and Hysteria,"Def Leppard's tenth studio album having catchy 80s power pop vibe is a nice album if you are a fan of the genre. It is surprisingly mellower extension of the last album, Euphoria.I had expected more hard-edged sound but I may have to wait that from the next one.Grumbling aside, it really have excellently catchy songs and you will be sure to love it if you love Def Leppard in the same manner as Survivor, Billy Joel, Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, and Electric Light Orchestra. But my best pick is not on those catchy gems such as YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, UNBELIEVABLE, LONG LONG WAY TO GO, EVERYDAY but CRY, and SCAR.Best fit for mid 80's power pop fans but if you are looking for hard-edged DEF LEPPARD maybe you can skip this and wait for a new one."
4,X Marks the Spot,"I will confess that i didn't get ""into"" DL until Pyromania, and always thought that Hysteria was a MUCH better effort, despite the incessant rantings of those who still long for the music they listened to 20 years ago. But for this DL fan, ""X"" is a great outing for the boys. Good sounds throughout - and for the first time in a LOOOOONG time, this is a CD that I have played again and again and again. Maybe I'm getting old, but it's time to appreciate a good classic rock album - and this is definately one. If ""Now"" doesn't get you going (and it has a pretty interesting video, to boot), well then you're definately living in the past. If you like the Leps, this is a well-overdue visit.Time to move on - good job, boys!"
3,STICKY SWEET....but not enough ROCK! ROCK!,"The new DL album was a disappointment at first listen - there were just no memorable songs! Nothing stood out as a major track. But now after 2 weeks i can say that i am enjoying more songs off this CD than i anticipated. Songs like ""Torn To Shreds"" and ""Girl Like You"" sound very good & catchy, but i doubt they will work well live.Hard rock acts have been a bit of a letdown in recent times (Hollywierd anyone? Van Halen?). I think X is a decent album, but not the album that DL fans had been hoping for. Like Euphoria, it just feels too contrived and calculated. If I could ever meet the band i would ask them to go listen to High N Dry again."
3,Pretty Decent Come back album,"The new Def Leppard album is probably the band's best album since Hysteria but it still can't be as highly rated as Hysteria or Pyromania. They are trying though...nothing special here but it's worth buying if you love the band like I do. Good vocals by Joe, good drums, guitar, they sound good...but not as good as they did in the 80's."
4,with time comes change,"Ok, so this new def leppard album isn't as much of a heavy metal hard rock album as the stuff that they released in the 80's. But they have been around long enough and I think have proved themselves over and over again, that they could play pretty much any kind of music they want to. They went through somany hardships to get where they are today. first Pete Willis drank tothe point where he was incapable of playing and had to be let go. Rick Allen lost his arm, and nearly his life, and lastly the guitar legend Steve Clark lost his long battle with alcoholism. I personally think it is a good album, and a welcome addition to any REAL Def Leppard fans collection. And lastly, to those of you who do not like this album I think it is time for you to grow up and be more open minded."
2,X-def leppard,"Hello! Wake up, def leppard ! I have been your loyal fan since "" On through the night."" I have always loved your works until this X- thing which sounds very soft and spongy to me. I mean having pop metal/rock sound is great, but this whole X-album sounds like backstreet boys mixed with Britney Spear to me. And sorry I hate backstreet boys to the bone ! ... For this album, the only thing that sounds like def leppard is the chorus part which is the only great part about this album. Changes are great like what you, guys did in Slang. Again changes are great as long as the soul remains the same. By the way, I think the band photo on the inside with Band members, jumping high on the air looks kinda perverted to me. But I will keep on following your next album. If it still sounds Britney Spear-ish like this X-thing, I guess I have to quit."
2,This album pains me,"A DL fan of old, I was at their concert the weekend Pour Some Sugar On Me hit #1, and Joe turned 30. Ah, the good old days. Steve Clark's death several years ago had a bigger impact on this band than anyone realized at the time. Have you liked an album of theirs since he died? Yes, Retroactive, but that doesn't count because he wrote/recorded music for that. Sadly, this album- like the others- falls short. There's a lot of airplay for ""Now"" and I had high hopes. Maybe, just maybe....If you're on the fence about whether to buy, remember they're not a heavy metal/hard rock band anymore. Like them for who they are now, not for who they were. Music reminds me of Adrenalize, the last DL album I bought. Dear God, is Joe rapping in ""Gravity""?I like ""Love Don't Lie"", ""Now"", and ""Scar"". Old fans probably will too. Reminds me of what they used to be... but give me Pyromania any day!"
3,"Dude, Where's the Guitar?","Don't get me wrong, I really am a big fan of Def Leppard, but what happened to the ""wall of guitars"" that made Def Leppard sound BIG? This CD sounds like the Backstreet Boys."
1,Sucks,"Four Letter Word is somewhat vintage Def pop but the rest sounds like Def Leopard playing fake garbage like camp rock. Fail album. I mean this band wasen't a strong band musically to begin with, now they stood to this? They even play with Taylor Swift these days, Def Leppard the original shat out manufactured crap rock band."
3,"Half Bad, Half Good","This should be a warning to every band that thinks using outside writers will get you hit singles. They won't and in the case of ""X"" they just make about half of the album really awkward sounding. The album starts off nicely with ""Now"" but quickly goes straight down with ""Unbelievable"". What IS unbelievable is that the band convinced themselves that recording this song was a good idea. That's followed by 4 so-so songs that all sound a little too pop for Def Leppard. Then without warning the album starts to actually get good with ""Torn To Shreds"" through the epic ""Scar"" with the exception of the sticky sweet misstep of ""Girl Like You"". Let's see, the first half of the album was written or co-written by outside writers and was very poor while the second half was all penned by Def Leppard and was actually pretty good. Hopefully we can chalk this up to a lesson learned and just forget that ""Unbelievable"" every happened."
3,Def Lepmedown,"I am a Def Leppard fan and have been since, ""On Through The Night."" But I do miss the rock and roll that the band put out in the days of ""Pyromania"", ""Hysteria"" and even ""Adrenalize."" If the band have defined themselves as Pop-Rock then I feel they followed through with that definition on this album. While you can't deny the guitar and the vocals being 100% Leppard, I have to wonder about the content of the songs. The songs are mostly love ballads, some about the good times in life and some about the low times in life. While one song will bring you up, the next track might bring you right back down. I will listen to the CD but it will not be in my list of favorites. They put out a 2002 Def Leppard album, but not a Def Leppard rock and roll album."
5,DON'T MISS THIS ALBUM!,"Def Leppard is back in form with a well-crafted set of songs that appeals to all fans of music, whether it's metal, rock, or pop. Ignore your preconceptions and simply listen to this album for what it is - a great rock n' roll record.""X"" only gets better with each listen!"
2,Third rate B-Sides,"Def Leppard have long been one of hard rock's most talented and melody driven bands, but this album is really, really bad. Nothing on this disc rocks at all, its just a collection of cheesy, third rate power ballads that don't compare to classics like ""Love Bites"" or ""Bringin on the Heartbreak."" This disc has none of the edgy, headbanging intensity found on ""Pyromania,"" ""Hysteria"" or 1999's ""Euphoria,"" and the only really good track is the opener ""Now."" It seems the rocking, melodic metal band that was once Def Leppard has finally traded in their rock n roll for AM radio shlock. Don't buy this album, instead go back to the classics and rediscover how good Def Leppard used to be."
2,Disapointing to say the least,"Def Leppard really lost it with this CD. Unlike Euphoria, which had a few good songs, X only has about 3 or 4 songs actually worth listening to. This is not the Def Leppard we are all used to. Most of the songs on this album have the same feeling and are very mellow and weak (not to mention a little familiar at times). If you are a casual Def Leppard fan you should stay away from this CD. However, if you are a fan who needs to have all the albums, buy it and stash it away someplace where you never have to listen to it again. I am very disappointed with this album. It gets 2 stars for the four songs that are actually good. Hope this is it from them!"
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME???????!!!!!!!!!,"Im not even going to waste my time typing out a long message about this awful album....All i'm going to say is i'm a very open minded person when it comes to music, but my god this album is beyond awful and a discrace to the def leppard legacy!!!! Stay clear of this album if you are a true rock/metal/def leppard fan!!!"
3,What Happened Guys?,"Being a die hard Def Leppard fan, I am a little disappointedin this one. They seem to have lost that hard guitar ripping edge that they had in the early 80's. I know they are trying tokeep their old fans and get new ones, but this album isn't the way. They sound too much like the fluff bands today.I am only giving them 3 stars (and that is generous.) Come on guys, give us that old Def Leppard ... sound we've been waiting for!!"
4,Good Buy,"This a good all around album. There isn't a bad song on X, and that says a lot now a days. I purchased X the day it was released and it is still in my CD player a majority of the time. Anyone that bad mouths what Def Leppard is doing today is still stuck in the 80s and doesn't have a clue when it comes to music."
5,Solid: Def Leppard Maturing With Their Fans,"This album is a polished and thoroughly enjoyable outing from the best thing (Liz Hurley and Catherine Zeta-Jones aside) to ever come from Britain's entertainment scene. The album *won't* rock your socks off - this is basically a relaxing and smooth release that helps you to mellow out, rather than rock out. Hey - Def Leppard's done plenty of rocking. This album doubles their number of great ballads, while adding a slick twist with relaxing, yet upbeat, pop/rock tunes.If you're looking to headbang, sorry - you won't find the next 'Pour Some Sugar On Me' here. If you want some Def Leppard just having fun, with catchy melodies (that's melodies, not rockers per se) and a great sound, this is a solid listen. Better than Euphoria, in my opinion - sounds more polished and not quite as broad in musical styles. They have a definite over-arcing melodic, softer side on this disc - and I love it."
5,Surprisingly Perfect!,"when this record came out i was a little nervous. i'd just found out WHO Def Leppard was and, after buying Pyromania and Hysteria, had them ranked as one of my favorite bands. what i was hopeing for on X was that the times hadn't changed them. so i bought the cassette and, after listen to like 2 songs put it with my other tapes and didn't listen to it again for a long time. then my little brother (who's a teenager and just getting into a love for 80s metal) bought X on a wim and told me he LOVED it. surprised i gave it another shot and couldn't help but agree. though a lot of it is balladish and poppy it's done SO WELL that you have to love it. Long Long Way To Go blew me away! i've never heard Joe Elliot put so much emotion into a song! that song alone is worth buying the record for. the rest is really good. though, in my opinion, they should have thrown in more of what Hysteria and Pyromania were built on, this cd is a must have!"
4,"DEF LEPPARD, STILL ALIVE","EXCELLENT ALBUM, NOT AS GREAT AS HYSTERIA, BUT SURRELLY TE BEST SINCE. SONGS LIKE ""SCAR"", ""TURN TO SHREDS"", ""NOW"" AND ""EVERYDAY"" ARE THE BEST TRACKS OF THE ALBUM, AND THE SOPHISTICATED OF THEIR MUSIC WILL MAKE YOU FEEL PROUD ABOUT THE BAND.DEF LEPPARD IS STILL ROCKIN', STILL POPPY, BUT STILL THE BEST BAND."
4,Try this album if you are a Def Leppard fan!,"This album is not pyromania, or hysteria, but more like a cross between Slang and Euphoria, leaning more towards Euphoria. I think the other reveiwers are too harsh. This album is very mixed. But if you love the old stuff, try Torn to Shreds, it is great, and Four Letter Word, Scar and You;re so beautiful rock. Now and Unbeleivable are more modern. This album is very good. It is Def Leppard, if you heard a random track somewhere you would know that it is them. I guess what I am trying to say is Def Leppard is back and this album is going in the cd changer right along with hysteria, pyromania, and euphoria!"
3,"Once A Fan, Always A Fan, But...","I love Def Leppard. But I really feel that the lads from England have left their hardcore fans out in the cold with ""X"". They have chosen a musical direction not befitting a band of their callibar, attempting to fit in with the mainstream and not sticking to their hard rock roots. ""X"" has its moments, and lead singer Joe Elliot's voice and the bands harmonies are both tight and on the money, but ""X"" sounds more like an older more talented version of *N'Sync than it does hard rock metal monsters. The lead off track ""Now"" uses a drum track instead of the powerful drum prowess of stickman Rick Allen, and the song ""Long, Long Way To Go"" is a keeper, however there are no real standouts on this disc. Not a terrible album, just not a Def Leppard album."
1,It's all over,I've been listening to Def Leppard since before their first album and it's kinda sad to here what it's all come too. Sorry lads but you just went over the top with an album FULL of mush!!
1,Need A Few Extra Hands,"Oh man this album is bad. Even if Rick Allen had four arms, the rating wouldn't go up a half point. Throw in the towel boys. Slayer rocks harder after 20 years, Def Leppard don't. They follow trends."
1,don't waste your time,"As a previous reviewer said, I really tried to like this album. It didn't happen. Any comparison to Hysteria is flat wrong. In my opinion, there are two good songs. Now and Love Don't Lie. Either buy the singles or buy it used."
1,Sappy-radio-milk-toast,"I was really looking forward to this album, but I was majorly bummed after the first listen. Nothing really rocks on here at all. This is nearly all sappy radio ballad stuff. If I wanted widdley-woo (and sometimes I do), I would have pulled out my Enya CDs. I don't need Def Leppard to do that for me. I wanted to rock, but it just didn't happen with this one. After a second listen, I still couldn't find anything I liked about it. Another of my favorite groups that won't be an ""automatic buy"" for me in the future. I guess they just aren't my cup of tea anymore. This album is for heartsick teenage girls."
2,Just plain bad. Not the Def Leppard that everyone knows.,"I am a big fan of Def Leppard. They were in their heyday in the eighties and made some great rock music back then. However, it seems like ever since Steve Clark died, they've never been the same. On this album they sound more like the Backstreet boys than Def Leppard. It's almost like they forgot who they were. What happened to the huge choruses, screaming back vocals and loud arena anthems? They sounded great in the eighties, but now, they've lost the edge. What happened guys?"
1,Oh my God...,This is not the Def Leppard I know and love. I can appreciate it when rock bands experiment but this album sounds more like N'Sync. God help us. There isn't a single listenable rocking tune on this album. Def Leppard used to rock. What happened?Do NOT buy this!
3,"Soft rock at best, euphoria was better","X is definately a DL album but very differant , soft n' sometimes boring , it has a bit of hysteria in it and a tad of slang, but lacks the rock of euphoria .CRY and EVERYDAY rock on well , the rest are well written and produced .This could even be called easy listening. LONG LONG WAY TO GO is a good song and GRAVITY is fairly decent.Dont expect hysteria 2 like ive heard and its no euphoria. Its almost slang with a soft hysteria prod.Its no where near the GREAT PYRO! . PYROMANIA, HYSTERIA ,EUPHORIA , HIGH N' DRY, X, SLANG, ADRENILISE, ON THROUGH THE NIGHT, are my order of faves.Get it recorded if you can i dont know if its worth buying.Go buy the best of WINGER thats a great album."
4,Well Done Ol' Chaps!,"I love it!!! I've been a DL fan since the 5th grade(I just turned 30 a week ago) ""Torn to Shreds"" and ""Gravity"" are my most favorites of this AWESOME CD."
1,Will somebody please slap some sense into these guys!,"Listening to this nonsense is absolutely depressing! They've lowered themselves to make this pop [music] for 13 year old girls. I'll give it to you straight... #1 Pyromania, #2 Hysteria, #3 High 'N' Dry, #4 Retro-active (the good half)... all the rest you can throw in the trash! And this is coming from a diehard Def Leppard fan, back when they knew how to make good creative kick-ass rock n roll music. DEF LEPPARD, either give each other a swift kick in the ass, or simply turn off the mic, roll over dead, and give me some AC/DC and Ozzy --- just about the only known survivors of guitar-based 80s hard rock, heavy metal, or whatever we called it back then. Oh how I miss GUITAR-BASED rock n roll! Will somebody please teach these pup ""bands"" of today how to play a guitar!!?? Angus, help these poor souls!!"
4,the love ballad album,"This cd isn't a pure Def Lep rocker album.Yes it has some rokers on ,but its more ballad then hard rock.Whitch in Def Leps case isn't bad, cause they put out great ballads.Long way to go is by far the best ballad out there.Perfect song for missing your ex boyfriend or girlfriend that you still want back.The song KISS still has that classic Def Lep guitar feel to it.This album though is more like a top 40 or adult rock cd.Its a very cd , the best since Hysteria."
3,The Bad Boys from Sheffield are back...almost!,"One of the most exciting live bands in Rock & Roll history has finally released another album, the very much anticipated X. I must admit that I was very disappointed with Slang and saw slight glimmer of hope in Euphoria. But I have gone back to listening to High And Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria, which are amazing. So, here comes X. When listening to the album as a whole, the first two things that I notice are the brilliant guitar talents of Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell throughout the entire listening experience, and that the direction of the band has officially changed to Pop-Rock as opposed to Rock-Pop. There are no heavy hitters anywhere on the record. The opening ""Now"" is their current radio hit, a Def Leppard signature rock ballad with excellent vocals and guitars. ""Unbelievable"" follows in similar fashion but with a lot less punch.More of the review at [URL]"
4,Unbelieveable!!!,"They have come back with a new style and it is fantastic! The words and the music tie together beautifully Torn To Shreds, Unbelievable, Scar, Love Don't Lie, Everyday and Now are the best picks. (my humble opionion) Elliott sounds better than ever, last comparison would be to Hysteria, however, X has more deeper meanings and thoughtfulness put into the lyrics and music. Lots of emotion and energy. Whether older fan or new, you will not be disappointed."
1,What Could've Been,"Had Def Leppard stuck to their roots, they could have been the next Aerosmith. Because of this release, as well as their previous release, they have bound their fame to the 80's and early 90's and prevented what could have been the greatest rock career ever. Unless they come back soon with a powerful rock release, they will be known in this millennium only through classic rock venues.This latest album is the sequel to the release that evidenced their abandonment of the hard rock genre. Everything their fans appreciated in them is gone."
1,What Happened to Def Leppard?,"I have been a Leppard fan since their second album High N'Dry. That album is true Leppard rock and roll! Since Slang, however I have been disappointed in most of their work. X is by far the worst Leppard album of them all. There are no tracks the really rock like on Pyromania or even Hysteria. It's like they were trying to be like Hootie and the Blowfish, it's like they got old! If you want ""old"" Def Leppard type rock then don't buy this CD. If you want easy listening adult contempary music with some guitars then this CD is for you. I'll sell you mine, CHEAP!"
1,"Yes, this is 2002...","And that is the trouble with this new Leppard album. Here, they put behind once and for all the fact that they once were a rock band. Now they are just a pop band, a ballad band, a ladies band, what is a shame, given the high quality of its musicians.I'm not living in the past, but this is a sell out band. At least, they can be proud of staying alive while thousands of others eighties bands disappeared along the nineties.X is the end of the road for Def Leppard, in my opinion. They will go on, but they will not get my vote (money) anymore."
2,"I hate to knock on this CD, but...","...coming from a band that created such unimpeacheable classics as PYROMANIA, HYSTERIA, ADRENALIZE & EUPHORIA, this new CD is a total letdown. I know, I know, I know - they shouldn't be stuck in the past rehashing the same riffs, but given that we are in 2002, you'd think that rock would sound alot more modern and futuristic; instead, nearly every current rock band rehashes tired sounds from the '60s and '70s (why don't bands copy sounds from the '80s? In a strange way, most music from that decade sounds alot more futuristic and forward-looking than most current music) Anyway, I hate to knock a band that was a big fan of for 15 years, but this CD nearly killed my interest in them.But hopefully they'll rebound from this album like they rebounded from SLANG when they released EUPHORIA..."
1,Hair Metal Fan,"This Album does not hold a candle to the earlier Def Lepp albums Pyromania and Hysteria, nor does it even reach the level of Euphoria or Retroactive. Even compared to their more recent offering, A tremendous disappointment."
4,Just enough Slang in it to make it interesting,A little better than Euphoria because it has some bite to it. Good effort- especially the first five songs. I can see hits if the DJs will play it.IMO
3,X Streamly Boring,"Ok here we are 2002 and in need of an all out Ball$ to wall Rock N Roll CD.Def Leppard are about to release the long awaited ""killer"" Disc. And they have the talent to do it!!!But not this time. Sorry but at the initial spin of this disc, I gotta say I was not rocking out to it. X must stand for all the X-wives, girlfriends ect..... cause to me most of the songs are about ""tear in my beer"" feel bad for me, lost you boo hoo....the only thing missing is ""today my dog died"".I'm sorry I really don't mean to bash the guys ... the music is ok, and there are a couple of times where you think that they may break into the fist pumping, guitar driven Leppard that we grew up with.... but alas as stated before YAWN....""Four Letter Word"" comes close....has an AC-DC sound to it, even has a lifted solo I think..... ""Love Don't Lie"" is OK.... ""Gravity"" is cool - I think a left over from Slang also ""Girl Like you""But the rest... oh wellNow live, these songs may have a harder edge..... let's hope"
3,You might as well try them for the price,"Although I didn't like this product and found it to be uncomfortable, I saw on other sites that many people love this product... so, why not try it for the price. I am going to keep this product and give it to whomever can use it for themselve. Fast shipping was appreciated too."
4,"Older, funky, fun","If you can get them cheaply and avoid shipping costs, these are nicer than the usual ones and for older baby-boomers, a trip back to the 50's and early 60's."
3,Interesting material from a youngster,"This book claims to be material from a young occultist who came on the scene and then vanished. There's no way to tell how true any of that is, but the material does have some modest value.The material is very basic, and the attempts at more advanced work are partial and unrealized. The Druidry is Doug Monroe, and the Necronomicon is Simon, so it's all just the most commercial available material. The author has some interesting insights in the more theoretical sections, but nothing very unique.All in all, this only manages to be moderately interesting, and of little use beyond the most basic sorts of study and practice."
2,This not a best of !!,"I don't know why Jive is toying with Aaron, by releasing this kind of not worthwhile release.There is almost no difference with the Most Requested Hits cd. Aaron deserves better.It only can be called a best of, when also his 4 hits of his first album were included. (trans continental records/Edel)I'm a 100 % Aaron fan and i have more than 100 CDs of him (released from different counties ect), but I would NOT buy this cd."
3,Not as substantial as it looks,"This is a cute bracelet in sterling, but the links were essentially formed over a mold...so the underside is hollow. In the picture it seems to be a substantial bracelet with a little weight to it. And the product weight is listed in lbs which is clearly incorrect, but I was a little disappointed when it arrived. If it was purchased for me, I would have returned it. On the other hand, my son's 15 y/o girlfriend (for whom it was intended) was thrilled."
1,Even quilt shop teachers can't figure out her instructions!,Don't waste your money on such a sloppy pattern designer and writer. Her instructions have many errors and missing steps.
2,Strangely focused book,"This is a weird book. If you happen to be a stock analyst specializing in American stocks for sale in the European market, and planning to move to Switzerland, this book probably has a lot to offer you. Otherwise, there are plenty of better books out there. It contains a rather small guide to hiking and skiing trails in certain areas of Switzerland, plus some extensive and cynical views of the Swiss banking and stockbrokering system. The author also displays a certain amount of homophobia, in case that matters to you. John McPhee's book gives a much better look at the Swiss character, and just about any travel guide gives you more travel information."
3,Civil War Fueds,"There were Southern sympathizers in the North and Northern sympathies in the South. The people were very suspicious of each other at this time. In Shelton Laurel of North Carolina it was no different. ""Victims"" is a true story of a mass murder in Shelton Laurel. Were these people divided because of state rights and slavery or their linage and personal feuds? There was trouble between the town of Marshall and Shelton Laurel. Thirteen of Shelton Laurel's people were killed. Did anyone get a fair trial?"" I did not know this story and was glad to learn about the killings in Shelton Laurel. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
2,Whoops!,"I did not read this item well enough. I did not realize this was a book for Christians. I tried reading this book because it is a good subject, but I couldn't get past the Christian aspect of this. Lots of Bible passages and references to God in the book. If you are Christian this would be a great book for you!"
1,Egyption,Print is so glossy it will never look old like I had intended it to look. I would not recommend anyone to purchase this print( if you don't want a high gloss paper). I had to paint over the poster with clear coat(flat) for it to look older. The poster isn't on thick paper so it tried rolling on me in the end. I then had to put it on a strecher. To much work for a poster no matter how cheap they may be.
4,one of the basic Coltrane's albums,"This is in my view one of the basic Coltrane's albums. From 1957 to 1958, John Coltrane try to find his style from Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk. Standard Coltrane, to be fair, is a fruit that is rewarded. A fascinating compilations for early sight and sound of young Coltrane's talent. Above all, 'Spring is here' is to become another of Coltrane's favorite standards. And This is a hugely thoughtful and technically adroit reading, ranging without strain across two and a half octaves. The album is an intense spiritual and thoughtful re-construction."
2,one tiny wafer of the problem,"I choose this, b/c image reminded me of massage ball i used to buy a while back.Nope. What i got is not even remotely close to it - its some odd inflatable stuff.. I think somewhere else on amazon its sold as porcupine ball or something. Basically - there is no ""needles"" but rather smooth bumps. Which is not what i needed.So.. up to you.."
2,Technical errors mar the Kindle version,"Boole is often considered the founder of modern mathematical logic and I was looking forward to browsing through the Kindle version of his book. Unfortunately, what is being sold is a great disappointment. The Kindle edition is the result of scanning the original book using character recognition software to convert the scan into digitized text. A responsible publisher would follow up the automated scan with a careful editing of the result to remove the inevitable errors. The correction process for this edition was (to be generous)grossly inadequate. The English text is full of errors -- mildly annoying. The equations, however, are often indecipherable or nearly so -- unforgivable! If you are interested in the details of Boole's mathematics, you are in for a lot of work -- work that should have been done by the publisher. If you are willing to ignore the mathematical details and merely want to skim the gist of Boole's arguments, a purchase might be worthwhile."
5,Very Impressive Debut!!!,"I recently saw Groove Stu open for Motown soul artist Donnie in Baltimore, and was blown away. Their live show was absolutely awesome. And so is their album Authentic 4.10 Sessions. On the album they take you through a range of different emotions and musical styles. Very much like their live show. Musically they give you hip hop, reggae, soul, and unbelievable ballads. You will not be disappointed. Pick this album up."
2,Good for the price,"Works fine as a mute, but it really needs some kind of a string or handle. Hard to pick up and remove quickly, and the clanging on the floor when it's dropped is not cool."
5,tragic individual in huge history,"First at all, I hope to dare speak, This is the best of his films.of course, I only had watched about his 20 films.(his films are over 100.) This story was based on old china history work about 'assassin'. As i know, original story is short.So i think, this film is belong to director 'chang cheh'.specially, love affair in movies.Someone said, this film smash hk people in 67 hk riot. Because, image of jimmy wang yu-play the leading role in movie- is tragic,nihilistic,..... This movie is core of chang cheh style.This is a reason, i select this as his best work.If you like 'chang chen',you must watch this.Thankswith my best regardshak"
2,Difficult Interface,I've used multiple sport watches over the years-this one is the worst. The interface is awkward and the on-line tutorial is no help either. They leave a telephone number for support but the person answering the phone acted as if they were not familar with the watch. I am now in the process of having this watch picked up as she believes there is a problem with the unit.
5,So happy with it!,I'm absolutely happy with this watch. Pedometer very accurate and very easy to set up. Great buy!
4,We Like It,"An excellent product. My wife and I both have versions. They require more calibration than one would think, but when one pays attention to settings (e.g. length of gait related to weight of backpack and terrain) they can be highly accurate. The settings are easy to change, but this can be a handicap when inadvertent contacts (e.g. with straps on trekking poles) cause the pedometer function to turn off. The software is somewhat difficult to master, but once learned, it is relatively easy to change essential functions.We will be using our pedometers on El Camino de Santiago.We would (and have) recommended this product to others.Russell J Hall, author of Gem of the Adirondacks and other Lighthall Books available on Amazon.com."
2,Not much new here,"Cornwell covers a great deal of material, albeit superficially, in re-hashing the issues under contention and the various parties in the debates, but no real light is shed, no feasible solutions proposed. This work would be worthwhile for those not familiar with how the Church has come to its current state of crisis in various aspects. His biases show as well. I read Hitler's Pope with great interest, but found this work somewhat lacking. Seemed thrown together in order to be timely."
1,Dynex not worth the risk - fried iTouch,Please consider this as simply additional info regarding Dynex products.I purchased this Dynex ipod dock[...]And it instantly fried a $200 iTouch 8GB device. Nothing to be done. Replace iTouch. I would highly recommend avoiding Dynex products like the plague. Not worth your Apple device.
5,Very good book,"great selection from Amazon, there was good communication, and fast service. The price of the items were very fair and reasonable."
5,Broken Hearts,"This is wrenchingly honest reflection of the effect of divorce on children. It would be useful to parents considering divorce or already divorcing and children who are compelled into a divided family. If you think your children are not very effected by this decision over which they have no control- think again. The voices of these children are beautiful, uninhibited and poignant. Highly recommended."
5,Broken Hearts...Healing has changed my life.,"Broken Hearts...Healing: Young Poets Speak Out on Divorce has changed my life. The voices of these young poets represent all the many children whose lives have been affected by divorce. Until now their words have been covered up and hidden, so that we wouldn't realize what an impact divorce has on children's lives. Some of their poems are very emotional and were painful for me to read, but others are about forgiveness and healing. Thank you Tom for letting these children speak out. This book has given me a new perspective on divorce. It has taught me that the true victims are the children and we must help them heal."
4,Smiley Forrest Face,"The face was just what I wanted. Nose is a little long, kind of witch like. But otherwise was the face I had been looking for. The item also arrived just three days after I ordered it instead of the seven to ten they predicted. Very prompt service."
1,How could this book be wrong?,"Considering the fact that one of it's authors was convicted of beating and stabbing his wife to death (Murray), you would have to believe this book holds all the truths about the language of sadomasochism! Somebody spend the $100 and let me know if you learn anything."
5,Frontier House - AWESOME,"The Frontier House was an awesome program. We all think about what is would have been like, but they got to do it. We learned what life could have been like in the 1880's. I just wonder if Frontier Valley is still there, if it's open to the public and if you can visit the place where it ""experiment"" took place. I think it would be fun to try it. That kind of life is not for the weak. I just wish they would have shown more about the actual daily life and not so much of the drama from the twentith century. The Frontier House website is also an excellent source of information for those of us who were born in the wrong century."
5,A Must-See for All family Members,"This is a story that all members of your family should see... how the lifestyle in the 1883 Montana wilderness was one of simple pleasures with a lot of honest work. Thoroughly enjoyable viewing of the lives of three families. Once you start watching this excellent PBS production, you won't want to stop."
2,It WAS Too Short For Digital Standards,"A word to the wise, as a collector I got this one, but beware, many of theses titles are the 10 track versions(look at seller info that it is the 12 track version you actually are getting)& I found a 12 track version. The title of the CD misses the actual track, they used 7"" edits on some tracks & could have actually used full versions on this collection. So unless your collector, you might want to buy ""This Is The moody Blues"" first & then ""Anthology"",or the box set ""Time Traveller"" (look for the 5 CD set if you can find it with the BONUS CD) or just get ""Moody Blues Gold"". I got them all, so hopefully I helped the buyer out ;-). Search ""Judemac forever"" on msn."
3,I may be different,"...but my disk has a different song order than listed here. Although you could argue that this is not really a best-of collection, most of the songs are very enjoyable. If you ever enjoyed the ""Long Distance Voyager"" release, this CD has the best songs from that, plus great songs from the earlier releases. ONE MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT: the disk that I purchased has the short version of ""Nights in White Satin"", without the spoken ""breathe deep the gathering gloom...."" portion...bummer!"
5,They're more than JUST (SINGERS) IN A ROCK AND ROLL BAND!,"I'm SITTING AT THE WHEEL, listening to THE VOICE and have one QUESTION...Why aren't these guys in the hall of fame??? ISN'T LIFE STRANGE? Such meaning in their music...My GEMINI DREAM is to enjoy more NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN, and these guys should not be cast aside as DRIFTWOOD! Love this CD!"
1,Intelligence and Religion?,"Although I absolutely believe in a person's right to believe in whatever crazy ideas they choose to (Jesus, Bigfoot, UFOs), I must vociferously protest the use of the words ""Intelligent"" and ""Religion"" in the same sentence."
2,Not effective enough,"I used it in my home, and all i notice is they don't seem to work. Please buy something else instead."
2,12 months? No way.,"Isn't working out the way I expected. 12 months? Nah. More like 2. These seem to be the absolute weakest roach traps I've ever bought. They barely work, for some reason."
2,I wish it had worked better,"It seemed to work, the little roaches that we had seemed to be tapering off, but then they returned with a vengeance within a few weeks. Disappointed."
1,Shoddy quality,"This product works for less than two months. Try other products!Don't confuse this product with ""Dial 18CT Combat Roach Bait - 97218"".Dial 18CT Combat Roach Bait - 97218 is much better!!!"
4,Best case for an iPod,"Like every case I have ever used, the belt clip is rather flimsy (I blame my studded leather belt for this problem). Also, the screen protector can be difficult to put in. Other than that, this is an absolutely great case. Aside from the jack for the headphones, it provides protection to the entire iPod (screen, wheel, body, and even the 30 pin connection on the bottom). The screen cover takes away a little of the brightness, but somehow makes it look clearer at the same time because it hides the scratches it accumulated prior to this wonderful case."
3,Not As Great as the Hype,"My daughter has asked for a toy Ambulance that makes noise for quite some time. This looked like exactly the right thing, and the fact that it was always out of stock seemed to confirm the suspicion.The toy is not that strong (though it hasn't broken in the 2 months we own it), though it is quite boring. It does play a little song when you push the button, but that's it.This is not a tough truck like Tonka usually is, and there isn't much to it.If you are buying it for a kid with low expectations, you should be satisfied. My five year old is happy enough with it."
4,A must for for indoor Bonsai newcomers.,This is an excellent book for newcomers and pros alike. It encourages one to break with many of the old traditions and grow your Bonsai indoors! It covers all aspects of tropical and sub-tropical tree cultivation and gives hints and tips on every page. Excellent value for money at any price.
2,Ok Beginners book,"This is a good general basics book -- it has beautiful color plates and some good diagramming on prunning and training.I found the index of specific species to be very lacking and there is no ""problems"" section so if you have a problem that is not pest or disease related -- you can't find answers to pretty common situations(like leaf drop) here."
3,Indoor Bonsai,"A very basic bonsai book. Good for beginners who wants to grow bonsai inside the house. The information about the suitable species for indoor training is very helpful. there are no ""big and old"" bonsai pictures in this book, mostly young plants. Again, a book for beginners."
2,Uneven toasting,"The original toaster did not toast on one side. Reolacement did work better, but toast is uneven. Looks good. Not worth the price. Could have gotten a better toaster for less money."
5,Excellent Item,We have a family of 5 and have been using a 3 tray worm factory for several years now. It works great and I use the castings for my potted plants and add to my flower beds and garden. You can really tell a difference. We even use the castings to make a tea an spray on the grass.
3,Not for complete beginners,"This seems like a very good product for people who know something about vermicomposting. I did not. As a result, even though I followed the directions, all of my worms died. I did some research after the fact and discovered what I did wrong, which is admittedly probably too complicated for the handy ""cheat sheet"" on top of the box.For complete beginners, I would suggest buying the book ""worms eat my garbage"" along with the unit, or upgrading to the worm factory 360, as it comes with an instructional DVD."
4,Worm Farm?,"I saw a conservationist demonstrate this product in the Adirondacks. I loved the idea because we have a small urban organic garden during the spring and summer in upstate NY....so we compost. We are always too lazy to carry out compost in the winter. I thought this would be a good alternative. Have not set it up yet because of our experience with fruit flies over the winter months. Trying to find a good solution to prevent this, as I am told that is the only drawback."
3,Received,Seems kind of cheap for $80.00. Too many companies cashing in on folks wanting to go green. Will update review in a few weeks.
3,"It works well, but has it's issues","The worm factory makes an adequate habitat for your favorite garbage eating critters (worms). However, it has it's problems. The first is that the drain spout is too small and gets easily clogged, requiring frequent thorough cleanings. The other issue is that it doesn't take a worm trained in the escape arts to figure out how to exit this bin. There are gaps all over the place which means lot of little worms wandering about if you are using this in an indoor location. Not difficult to clean the little critters up, but something to be aware of."
4,Works nicely overall,"I have been using this system for about a half a year now and it has worked out nicely overall.Pros:-None of my worms ever escaped - just keep the bin moist and the worms will stay.-The bin is easy to clean and transport - important for a college student.-It's relatively easy on the eyes and doesn't smell if you treat it right. :)Cons:-The drainage spout does occasionally get clogged, which is annoying.Hope this helps!"
4,So much better than home made,Keep it in the garage and no odor. Really like this item. Does what it says. Have about 8000 worms in it and no problems!
3,A little knowledge,"I bought the worm bin because I have wanted one for a while, but when I read the instructions I learned that the box needs to be kept away from temperature fluctuations, and away from rain or light. I had planned to put it on the back patio, because I don't have room for it in the house. After reading the instructions, and realizing it had to be kept indoors, I gave it away, and started a sturdier one outdoors.Assembly was pretty easy, but I had to enlarge some of the holes to get the items (spigot, bolts) through them. The item is light plastic, so it was easy to do with a kitchen knife."
5,Wonderful Worm Factory,"I love this product! I have been using this for about 1 month and it is better then I expected. The worms have been eating a good amount of kitchen waste. There is no smell. I was really worried about it stinking. I have it sitting in the corner of my dining room, and there are no disgusting smells. In addition to a great product, my kids really enjoy checking on the worms and watching our scraps disappear! Great product, easy to use!"
3,enjoyable but not great,"This story has a sweetness to it that is quite nice, however I found Amy a little to patronizing toward her family, believing she is the Only one of her sisters who has a hope of marrying without a dowry (as she is by far the most attractive).This aside the book is sweet and romantic, Amy has good intentions and truly does what she thinks is best. overall this book is an easy read, while not as good as Jo Beverley's later books it is enjoyable!"
5,This is still my favorite Regency ever.,"I love this book. No one else seems to give it the credit it deserves. You can cut the tension with a knife and I was laughing SO hard at the characters' thoughts and imaginations. This was the first regency I ever read and I've read a million after it, but it is still the best."
4,"A bit of fluff, but well-written.","This is the first Regency I've read, and it doesn't tempt me to read others, but I'm willing to try books by the author in other genres, since she seems to be a good writer."
5,No better headphones under $200,"I'm an amateur DJ, and I just keep buying these things. For listening at home or the office, I use the velour pads, and for shows I use the leather. Great sound, 3 different (replaceable) cords, interchangeable ear pads...you don't get these options at this price point. Main reason I like these though is that the audio response is really good even at very loud volumes - if I start to get distortion in the cans, you can bet that the distortion will start to come through in the speakers if you push the volume there as well. These aren't high-end Denons or HDJ-2000s or anything, but for $80 or whatever you end up paying, they are phenomenal."
5,Numark PHX - Awesome headphones,"As good as the high end Sony, Pioneer, or Technics dj headphones.I have a Rane TTM56 mixer and I can crank the headphone volume to ear bleeding levels with no distortion. I don't recommend doing that though.I just wanted to test them out.Great highs, mids, & bass for me.Everyones ears are different though."
1,Any Headphones are better than these,"These are simply the worst sounding things that I've ever put over my ears. You've heard of muddy bass... How about muddy everything. I was going to serious think about donating these to the school for the deaf so that people could experience what hearing loss sounds like.Buy a pair of cheap headphones for MP3's, portable CD players, or iPods and get an adapter if you want to use it on home equipment and it would sound light years better than these headphones!EDIT: Of course if you are looking at these you are probably looking for some DJ Headphones. Let me recommend the Marathon 1100's. See my review on Amazon."
3,does not hold much,I was a little disappointed to find that this lid holder won't hold many lids. I bought two of them and I still did not have enough space for all of my lids. I only have a 36 piece set. Each rack will only hold about 5-10 lids comfortably.
2,holder,"this is what I wanted but did not show how small it really was, only holds a few lidsNot great"
3,Nice idea but impractical,These organizers screw onto your cabinets which pretty much ruins them as the screws are very long and tend to come out the other side! Works well for larger lids but not so well for smaller ones. Good idea but installation is not very practical.
2,Cheap product,"I purchased these lid holders for my daughter and I. Very flimsy, not what I expected. I would not recommend them."
4,Easy storage for foil and wrap containers,This product is durable and it works great. It hooks over a cabinet door and stays put and holds our wrapping materials in their boxes very well.
3,Cheap but good,"The book is used one, and it cost me about $6 dollars. The quality of the book is same like the new one, just with some marks inside. It worth the price."
2,Book falling apart,"This book does not deserve the rating that the book seller have said. When I first got this book, there were already 10 pages that was falling off from the seams. I figure, forget about it, probably just a bad purchase. After 3 weeks, this book is completely falling apart. The seller of this book needs to look at the books that they have purchased and see if there is any damages. If there are damages, the seller needs to make necessary repairs before putting out there to sell. This is completely unfair for me as a buyer of this book. I could have purchase another copy from somewhere else that was without issue instead of this leaflet-like book'it is that bad!!!) that I have now."
1,Essential Academic Vocabulary: Mastering the Complete Academic Word List by,i dought it at 30th august but now it is october i still do not receive my stuff
3,Meh.,"I mainly ordered this for reference to a single song. I find that the orchestra is very skilled, but overall I'm not a fan of the soprano."
5,Still on my mind....,"I love both historical fiction and Christian fiction and this book (set of three stories) has stayed with me the last few days since I finished the last heart-wrenching story of the Riley family. I loved these stories so much that even though I have been a member of Amazon Prime for a long time, I have never taken the time to write a review. I highly recommend this book, and if you want more by the author I also LOVED the Claire series by Tracey Bateman. You can't go wrong here!"
4,Nice read,"This book contains the stories of three separate Oregon women : Star, Hope, and Eva. The three are united by difficult experiences, trust issues, and the convenient location of the perfect man for them in their life when they are most in need. In the first story, ""But For Grace,"" Star escapes from the saloon where her mother was employed, but is hunted by the proprietor who is determined to find her and bring her back. Next, ""Everlasting Hope"" tells of a widow who takes a wagon train to Oregon in an attempt to save her family. Lastly, Eva experiences a trauma and pushes away the ones she loves most.This book was pretty much as expected: nice, dependable, a little predictable, but not bad. It's a comfort read more than anything else."
3,An okay read.,"The stories in the book are not bad. I just felt that the characters fell in love to soon and that the plot had holes in it. I generally like Christian books like this, but it was not the best that I have read."
5,Love it!,"The music choice is excellent and the images go from lanscape scenic, to babies playing, to babies being held, back to nature scenes (many with animals). As an infant my son loved it and fell asleep to it several times. In fact, my husbnd likes it so much that he also has used it to fall asleep to!"
5,Smile Time,"I have 5 grandchildren and have gotten sets of Praise Babies for each of the families. I like the choice of music, and you can choose either an adult singing or a child. The pictures aren't flashy with too much movement but are calm and colorful. My grandchildren love the music and photo selections and so do I."
5,Love Praise Baby!,"My kids love Praise Baby! And, I love the soothing music, as well. Whenever my kids are getting wild or cranky I pop it in and it changes the atmosphere of our home. All the praise baby movies are pretty similar so I wouldn't worry about which one to buy. This one is a little more slow and soothing for night time, but not a whole lot different from others. Best age for these is 6 mo - 2 yrs"
3,not quite a romance......,"although well written, ""The Girl Who Invented Romance"" can get boring. Kelly Williams is a sixteen year old junior who has never had a date, much less a boyfriend. She constantly daydreams about finally meeting that one special guy. She decides to turn her daydream into a romance board game, in which the goal is to get to happily ever after. What begins as a game that would be more acurately titled ""A Fairy Tale Romance"" turns into a real life romance situation as Kelly witnesses her brother and his girlfriend (the perfect couple) break up, realizes that her parents marraige (the most romantic one on earth) may not be that rock solid, and begins to fall for the least expected guy ever. The book is good, but I felt that too much of it was simply daydreams and fluff,and not enough of a solid plot."
3,PERIOD 7 MRS. SULLIVAN,"Have you ever wished you could have the perfect date? Well in the book ""The Girl Who Invented Romance"" by Caroline Cooney thats what the main character wished. This books genre is fiction. In the story the main character Kelly Williams, wished for just that, the perfect date and the most perfect boyfriend. Kelly is a sixteen year old girl who has never had a boyfriend let alone a date.Kelly is very outspoken and dramatic. In the book Kelly invents a game called ""Romance"". In the game you can go on the perfect date and be set up with your perfect match. But when match is someone Kelly least expected him to be she becomes very confused and has trouble finding out what romance really means. I would recomend this book because Kelly goes through alot thihgs normal girls do and its a very interesting book."
3,New Version,Has been updated from original. Why'd they cut the part with Faith throwing nail polish at Kelly??!!
4,Romance is neat but Love is sweet,"Kelly is such a relatable character. With her plain features and ordinary style she is overlooked by most guys, but when she realizes she truly needs a boyfriend she takes unique approaches to satisfying her need. I loved how Will was not Mr. Perfect but they could share their feelings with each other and have a cute high school fling. The possiblity that they're relationship could go beyond that is not to unbelievable. They could learn that they are just what each other need. Will could be her support , listener, security, and her first love. Kelly could be a stable person in his life , a comfort, and most importantly someone to make him realize there is more to like to basketball and himself. The book frequently preaches the concept romancing your lover is nothing without love."
3,freak like me remix,"man, i was disappointed when i got this cd because the remix i was looking for wasnt on here. how do you make a cd titled freak like me remixes and not have all the remixes that you had for that song. it has been a long time searching for that one particular remix...man adina..holla at me..lol"
5,yeah I wanna freak like her,me and adina would have gotten alongh just fine she's a nympho just like me plus she'll do whatever I like thjat in a woman loved this song in 95.
3,Best of Sananda Maitreya,"I've often wondered what happened to Terrence. How could such a talented cat who is still recording to this day have fallen off and disapeared so comlepetely. Well, this album answers those questions once and for all. The four best songs are all from his debut, some of the later ones are o.k, like ""Elevators And Hearts"" and ""Do You Love Me Like You Say?"" but the choruses are repeated endlessly and this is the main problem with his post debut material- repetition. If you are really interested in T.T.D, you should either buy his debut or the more expensive import version of his greatest hits which has ""The Other Side Of Love"" and some of his better later material. He does do a nice version of ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" and a great live version of ""Under My Thumb"", but his original material like ""Vibrator""is kind of tiresome and wears out it's welcome real quick. He has also changed his name to Sananda Maitreya, not to be confused with Sanjaya Malakar."
3,Do You Love Me Like you say,"T Trent d'Arby is a fantastic artist. My only regret is that I attempted to download the mp3 of his newst creation, Vampires & ?. Sorry I don't remember the entire title. I was just disappointed that I could not order it here in the states. I know he relocated out of the states but I still feel we should promote his music, he is one of the greatest musicians of my lifetime."
4,Pretty Good,It grows on ya...If you don't like it at first give it a few spins. Real catchy melodies and great solos. Keep on groovin' Robert.
4,The Captive,"The Captive begins right where the first book left off. Faye is blackmailing Cassie into voting for her. Somehow Faye found out about Cassie and Adam and she's still threatening to tell Diana. So now Cassie is torn between her intense loyalty towards Diana and her feelings for Adam. She doesn't want Faye lying to Diana and hurting her. Faye also blackmails Cassie into getting the crystal skull and when Faye gets it she accidently releases more dark energy. In this exciting sequal we will learn more about Cassie's family's past, and Cassie will lose someone she cares about.Another great read. If you like this, be sure to check out the Night World series also by L.J. Smith"
5,The publisher needs to reprint this one!,"Book two began exactly where the first left off! Cassie was part of the Circle. Faye was blackmailing Cassie to help her become the Coven's leader when the votes were next cast. Cassie, torn between what she felt for Adam and her loyalty toward Diana, would do almost anything to keep Faye from twisting truths into believable lies!Meanwhile, more dark energy escapes from the crystal skull and more kids are found dead from the high school. Cassie will lose a loved one, find her working stone, learn some shocking family secrets, and her grandmother will reveal who Black John is and where he is now!Lastly, all secrets of all the Coven members are about to be revealed!***** This one is not as gripping as the first was, but still exciting! (Cassie is finally getting a back bone!) I am left eager to dive into the third book! Thank goodness I purchased all three books of this trilogy at once! Terrific series!"
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The whole series is great. L.J. Smith really knows how to write a good book. I borrowed the series from my friend a few years back and couldn't get enough! I was hooked on L.J. Smith and I have been buying her books ever since. Although I just couldn't find any more copies of The Secret Circle. If anyone out there has the complete trilogy and would like to sell it....I would pay original cover price for it (as long as its in a readable condition!) Please email me at Kandy600@hotmail.com or if you just want someone who shares a common interest e-mail me!
5,All L.J. Smith books are addictive and wonderfull!!!,"L.J. Smith has been one of my favorite writers for years. She is incredibly clever, and writes in such a way that you can't put down a book once you start it! I highly recommend her books to everyone!"
4,Good middle of an excellent series,"This book does all that the middle part of a trilogy does. It brings insight into characters, advances the plot, identifies the threat and begins to draw the group together. Only to bust them apart towards the end, or are they?The Captive in the piece is Cassie, who is being blackmailed by Faye. There is a dark force let loose, and it is affecting the Outsiders and those of the Coven. Things are not quite so black and white any more, except of course that Faye and Diana are like sunshine and shadow - the 'hero' and 'villain' of the piece. Cassie's feelings of guilt and unhappiness at her deception of Diana is well explored, and getting to know the Henderson brothers, Deborah, Melonie and in particular Nick better was worth reading the book for.The ending of the book was definitely the climax of the piece and will lead the final book off to a running start. All in all a successful 'middle' book, and most definitely to be read as part of the trilogy."
5,I LOVE HER BOOKS SOOOO MUCH!,"Ever since the first book i read by her...i haven't stopped. I have read ALL of the books that she's written and I reaalllyyy hope that she will start to write some more. All of them are SOOO good and I read non-stop for hours falling in love with the characters. She is my favorite author and I hope she will come out with some new books soon. The Secret Circle series was great. I liked it a lot...I wish there was more that she could write about them, but I guessed she decided to end it after three books. She is such a great author and if you haven't read any of her books, you really should. They will mesmerize you and you won't be able to put your book down!"
2,UK 'GhostHunters' NOTHING like US Show Based On It...,"I bought this DVD because I had heard complaints from the presenter of this show, Ian Cashmore, about the US version of the show, in which a paranormal investigation group investigates paranormal claims. In the UK version, there are NO investigations: the show is nothing but interviews with people who feel they have been haunted. While still interesting, I have read online that the US show 'bought the format' of the UK show, and expected something a little more... interesting. If you are checking out this show because you like the American Ghost Hunters: TAPS, then I recommended that you listen to their radio show instead. There are lots of shows like this on the Discovery channel, and unless you have problems sleeping you probably won't like this."
3,Looking good but disapointed in all the disclaimers that came with it,"This product stated that it came with a 6 month guarantee, which was part of my decision to buy a refurbished product. When this product arrived, it was in great working order, but it came PEPPERED with disclaimers talking about how it was for parts only and meant to be used only for printer technicians. That was disappointing. Although it seems to run great, I don't think they should send all those disclaimers.They have clearly stated a 6 month guarantee on this equipment and did not say it was for parts in their AD. They make it seem like they are selling it to be used in an office and then SURPRISE, they tell you they aren't guaranteeing it when it arrives in the mail. It is working great, but with all those papers that came with it, I'm holding my breath and waiting for it to break down! :>("
5,Built like a truck,"I've gone through dozens of teakettles in my life. They start out being ugly, then they get chipped or dented, parts fall off, and the whistle quits working. This one, while a bit pricey, is super durable and worth every cent. An added plus is that it's an attractive accessory that harmonizes with decor ranging from antique to modern. Electric range users will also be happy with the large flat bottom which conducts heat readily. Your water gets hot faster and you save energy, thus making it politically correct as well."
4,A mineral collector historical guide,"Mining has secrets and history I really didn't imagine. Danger, engineering, land knowledge, and above all the nose.Being an Italian collector of American Turquoise, and purchasing specimen from USA, I've been adressed to this book througha Turquoise prospector from Nevada.I still thank him for the advice."
3,it still only lasted about 2 1/2 weeks,"This was the best of the 4 toys, I bought for my dogs. But it still only lasted just over 2 weeks before they had it apart the squeaker out. For 1 dog it would be great, or even a smaller dog. I have mutts but they are a mix of rot and german shep and american bull dog and lab, so big dogs. have not yet to find a toy they like that they can't destroy"
2,Maybe not,"This product looks good, but my small dog broke the sound bag in just 2 minutes. It didn't last as long as some of the toys I have purchased at Walmart."
1,Destroyed in less then 10 minutes,"We have been very happy with the AKC brand of stuffed chew animals. We have had the raccoon and the squirrel both have lasted. The squirrel lasted a month and came to it's end with a game of tug of war with a 90 lb lab and our 35 lb pit mix. The raccoon is only on day 5 but looks like it will last equally as long.The rabbit on the other hand, was brought home today, and the belly stuffing and squeaker where out and everywhere in less then 10 minutes. We are very disappointed."
2,Bunny Not Bulletproof,"I was pleased when the bunny arrived quickly. I did read the advise not to leave the bunny unattended with a dog that has a tendency to chew up toys. My apparently fits into that category. With in minutes he had the face tore open. I took it away from him and my wife stitched the bunny up. A few days later he did it again, got the belly. In for another stitch up. Now the bunny is waiting to have his nose put back on. I had really hoped for a more durable product. It may just be my dog, but I wish they made rabbits out of Kevlar. Not likely to buy again, but it is cute."
4,So far so good.,"I purchased this rabbit for my 10yr Dalmatian who, as much as he loves playing with his soft toys, also enjoys equally trying to use them for attention by torturing them!He has had toys in the past that have not lasted more than a day or two from the teeth that are determined to remove the stuffing and squeak. I have to say that this rabbit has so far put up a much better show than I had expected. He has had it for a week and it still looks like new. It is a great shape for him to carry in his mouth and very life like. It seems to be sturdily built and I don't forsee me having to carry out any running repairs on it anytime soon.In general I am very happy with this purchase and would consider buying more of the range."
2,Came apart easily,"Bought this for my Golden Retriever and within 2 days he had a hole in it, the squeaker removed and all the stuffing pulled out. Not a good value for 14.00$"
5,My dog loved it,"When my dog saw this toy, you could tell she was so excited. She grabbed it and ran into the back yard with it and played for about an hour. During the following week, she kept going back to it, and hasn't lost interest in it yet. She usually tears up stuffed toys quickly, but this one has held up for over a week, with only a tiny tear on the side."
4,Destroyed by 5 mini-schnauzers in a few hours,These are the best toys that hold up with my 5 little monsters. I buy them anywhere I can find them on sale.
2,Dog loves it - Poor quality,"We gave this to my dog for Christmas. She is a 35 lb mix who loves 'stuffed animals' and has several. She 'plays' with her animals - fetches them, carries them around, cuddles up with them, squeezes them to make them squeak. She does not chew them up or pull them apart.But this rabbit fell apart immediately. she pulled out the seam and the stuffing before we even sat down to christmas dinner. My sister-in-law sewed it back up, and all was well, but the squeaker (which sounds more like a duck call than anything) stopped working within a couple of weeks.So - in the end, my assessment is that, especially for the price, this is a very poor quality item. But the dog does love it. It's still her favorite toy."
2,Not for the Type-A dog,"It took my one year old German Shepherd less than a half-hour to start dismembering this.This item may be fine for older / calmer dogs, but I wouldn't recommend it for puppies."
1,Hazardous,"My puppy was very excited at first to have this toy. However, soon after he got the toy, he started gagging. I realized that the synthetic hair was easily coming off this toy. He started swallowing the hair! I find this toy to be dangerous."
1,Quickly destroyed in no time.,My dog had this toy all of about 2 hours before she managed to destroy it and get the honker thing out and spread the stuffing everywhere. Not for a dog that loves to chew.
3,Wrong Size,"The iflter is exactly the quality that I have come to expect from K&N. However the site says that it will fit a 2007 Malibu MAXX LT V6 3.5L. THIS IS WRONG, AMAZON MUST CORRECT THIS. The proper filter is K&N 33-2315."
3,Okay but not great,"At this level of study not having kana and kanji is an absurd blunder. The only way to get the non-romanized versions of the text is to buy a very ugly teacher's edition of the core conversations and drills, which themselves become a bit too much like brute memorization here.This book is great for polishing your knowledge and tiny grammar subtleties, but something extra is needed in order to prepare yourself for making your own sentances, not ones you memorize from a book. (This could be provided by say, a teacher)So in this sense, a book more geared towards self-learning and adaptation would be the second half of the Yookoso series, Yookoso: A Continuation of Contemporary Japanese. This book is JSL2,3 and JWL2+more combined into one."
3,Pros and Cons,"Pros: Good grammatical structure, and just enough vocabulary necessary for a beginner to learn japanese. The book starts with a conversation in Romaji, then the translations, including vocabularies that must be memorized. The onversation is thouroughly explained later. Sentence structures and grammar lessons, and drills comes afterwards.Cons: Too much unecessary information about the conversations sometimes, and... the vacbularies and book itself could be more organized. Overall, I give it a 3, or a four."
2,Outdated,"This series either needs an update or to be replaced with a more comprehensive system. While JSL has excellent explanations of Japanese grammar, the entire book is printed in romaji, it has vocabulary that is no longer in use, and the order in which the book teaches words is ridiculous. Furthermore, the romaji itself is a system used only by JSL. If you are lucky enough to get a teacher who understands how to teach from JSL and a small enough class it can be a great book, but it is not for self-study and it needs to be phased out of college classes and favor of something more up to date."
2,Should not be used as a core Text,"When learning a language, it is important that class time be devoted to learning, not rehashing forced conversations that are supposed to emphasize grammar points. This makes students memorize things people normally do not say or phrases that are not commonly used. The most useful learning experiences in my opinion, were the times when the teachers threw in extra information/phrases and made use change up the conversations using added vocabulary. This book would do better as a text for a Japanese grammar class taught it English, rather than a Japanese Conversation class. The over analysis of the Japanese language is best suited for that type of environment."
2,Muted <<,"I've been playing the trumpet for almost 15 years and I bought this piece after moving into a 1-bedroom apartment. Gotta keep the chops up. This unit definitely reduces the amount of sound made by the instrument, but it reduces airflow through the instrument to such an extent that you almost have to play in a different way. With the mute on, the instrument requires nearly twice the amount of air to produce a tone at all. It's a tough trade off, and in my opinion, too much to ask."
5,reef coral review,this book is a must have for all snorkelers and divers. i gave it as a gift and the recipient was thrilled.
5,Wonderful Book,"Reviewed for web site:- whats that fish. Wonderful book, full of pictures and information. Good for any diver going to these area."
4,Faith Amongst The Turmoil,"I personally found this book incredibly interesting. I work in the Ohio prison system and the insight to a riot this book provides should be required reading for all who work in this profession. Mr. Dotson's strength of character and faith enabled him to not only survive this ordeal, but provide a role model to the other hostages. The book is somewhat critical of the Central Office response to the riot, and at times deservedly so, although I should add that being with the department I have seen first hand the growth and improvement from this terrible event. I would wholeheartedly endorse this book."
3,A Must Read Book for all Practitioners!,"As a practitioner in the field of criminal justice and a Correction Supervisor at the oldest operational prison west of the Mississippi, the Missouri State Penitentiary, I found this book to be extremely beneficial and educational in understanding the dynamics in both hostage and riot situations. As correctional professionals, we are faced with this dilemma every time we pass through the gates of hell into the community environment of convicted felons.Both Gary and Larry did an outstanding job in illustrating the trauma and horror one sustains in a crisis situation of this nature. However, more information on the aftermath and trials would have been beneficial for future research.If either Gary or Larry reads this review, please email me so I can obtain further knowledge on this subject."
5,Must read for Mt. Wilson enthusiasts,"If this book is all that Alan Sandage did for astronomy it would still be an enormous contribution. It provides semi-technical survey of all the work and people at the Mt. Wilson observatory up to early 1950's. Sandage does not merely list papers and projects and reproduces somebody else's opinion on them, he provides his own excellent authoritative analysis and summaries. As a scientist, he is known for strong opinions, but such personal angles can either be easily spotted or are largely smoothed by the perspective of a lifetime experience. The book is a work of love, actually worship. Anyone interested in MWO, or history of solar physics, stellar physics, or observational cosmology will benefit from this book."
5,Centennial Histroy of the Carnegie Institution,I received my copy of this book in fine condition and very promptly. The price of $80 is in line with what everyone selling this book is asking. The price is a bit high but that is true with any book of limited release. The book itself has a few very minor errors. This is the best history of the Mount Wilson Observatory which I have every seen. The only way to get a more comprehensive history is to have access to the Observatorys libary. Then you would have to spend years reading thru hundreds of volumns of techincal work for the same information.
3,Biskind Falls Short,"The Companion is a nice book with lots of trivia, however many of the facts stated are inaccurate. It's a must-have for the true padrinophile's collection, but for more accurate research, check out The Godfather Legacy by Harlan Lebo (1997), or The Godfather Book by Peter Cowie (1997)."
2,Cute but Squeaker Quit after 2 Days,"My daughter's cat really loved this toy but the squeaker quit working after the 2nd day of play. Some of these toys include an extra squeaker because this is an inherent problem with animal toys, but this one didn't include an extra and upon examination of the toy, there is no place provided to remove and replace the squeaker."
4,Overpriced but fun,"This Lego mini set is fun, but when you compare the Lego set we could have gotten in a store for the same price, it wasn't worth it to me as a parent. My son enjoys it though, and is happy with the shuttle. It is just overpriced for the amount of Legos that is comes with."
3,"Ok, but not a must have","I just played this CD for the first time, and I was a bit disappointed. I found Eva's voice annoying when it gets loud, and unfortunately too many of the songs in this album are louder--in a gospel sort of way--than I'd prefer. Granted this is a live album, but I wish the production and song selection had been better thought out. She obviously had raw talent and huge potential, but I've heard more refined voices than on this album. For me, only Stormy Monday and Fields of Gold live up to the hype."
5,One of the best female voices I have ever heard.,This is the second time I have purchased this CD. I bought one for a friend because I have fallen in love with Eva's voice. There are so many qualities in those pipes. She can put her own spin on every song she has redone and made it unique. I really don't have words to describe her. What a loss it is for her family and her fans because she was just beginning to be discovered. She never compromised her art for anyone. She had a pure voice and pure soul and it came thru in her music.
5,can't stop listeneing to it,"this is a fabulous recording, wish she was still alive so i could be a groupie"
5,The most incredible voice I have ever heard,"I first heard Eva on KFOG in San Francisco, singing ""Fields of Gold"" and was totally blown away. Her voice was the most beautiful I've ever heard. I immediately bought the Blues Alley CD, and soon after Eva By Heart and The Other Side. Her music is some of the most moving I have ever heard. Many thanks to all those who continue to promote it.Recently I was driving through Yosemite Valley listening to Eva sing What A Wonderful World and finally understood what this song was all about."
5,One Of The Lucky Ones!,"I was lucky enough to have had the pleasure to see Eva in person. I was sitting with friends in the back of a bar in suburban Maryland not knowing who the entertainment was, when the live music began. When she began singing, the crowd in the back stopped talking and like a wave rushing up to the shore, literally everyone got up from their seats and rushed to the front of the bar to see who belonged to that incredible voice! She had an amazing ability to convey so much genuine feeling in her voice.Years ago, I stumbled on ""Live at Blues Alley"" at a record store that had lots of ""local"" music. I haven't stopped listening to her since! I turned a lot of people onto her, including a boyfriend, who is now my husband of five years. We even played several cuts at our wedding reception. I've got them all, but over all this one is the best!We are so very lucky to have the gift of Eva in these recordings!"
5,eva cassidy at her best,eva singing live!what a great voice this is my personal fav of evas albumssuch a shame she did not live to become one off the worldsgreat artistsgreat rendition of bridge over trouled waters
5,Nice Music,Love Eva Cassidy. Just discovered her. What a talent. Great songs. Nice sound. Good mix of songs. Wish she was still here.
2,Sadly Overrated,"I bought this CD expecting great things but was very disappointed, especially by the psuedo-jazz tracks with electric bass. They don't swing and the bass player is terrible. Some of the pop tracks are ok, but to be honest i'd rather listen to sting. Perhaps the studio cds are better. . ."
2,Mmm... it's just okay.,"I had heard a few songs from Songbook in the store, and decided to try this 'live' album. Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing. Nothing of the magic that was Songbook.Capable note-wise, Cassidy's delivery is however, very unmoving here. It was, and is, very annoying, that I keep imagining this was all sung by Ann Wilson (of rock band Heart). But this is the wrong kind of music for a voice like that; i.e. she doesn't sound good live."
5,Stunning,"Eva Cassidy is one of those rare people who have a beautiful voice and the soul to use it. If you are a fan of blues, jazz, or vocals, then there is something on this album that you'll love."
5,Her best album,"A lot of people are introduced to Eva via her album ""Songbird"" which includes cuts from this LIVE album. ""Songbird"" is a great compilation but the songs have been edited to remove the intros and clapping heard on LIVE.""Cheek to Cheek"" is such a great song to get this album going. Things then slow down for ""stormy monday"" before slowly picking up again for the great rendition of ""Blue Skies"".This album is the only way to truly appreciate ""Fields of Gold"" as it was edited for its inclusion on ""Singbird"". I have to say I prefer the version on LIVE.If you were to buy this album, then ""The Other Side"" then ""Eva By Heart"", you would really have the essential Eva CD collection. Her remaining albums, while still good, are not coumpulsory listening like these three."
5,Smooth amd light.,"Eva Cassidy has accomplished something very rare in the blues genre. This album is smooth and light. Often, blues artists tend toward the melodramatic and moody; not Eva Cassidy. This album is suitable for background music at parties as well as a quiet evening with a nice glass of merlot.Fields of Gold is one of my favorite tracts. Sting has been quoted as saying that this cover, of his hit song, is his favorite rendition. A Wonderful World is nicely arranged and a nice twist on the traditional melody."
5,Soul touching...,Eva was recently introduced to me while touring the Napa country side and has since become an integral part of my day. Her voice has a way of gripping the heart and bringing a person into the moment of a song. She touched my heart with her velvet voice over and over again and the memories shared with her songs will forever be cherished.
5,A must see for any Neil Young fan!,"Anyone who digs Neil has to see this film. It dances in and out of quality concert moments, honest, informative interviews, and rare backstage footage of arguements and light humor. Put it next to Weld in your collection, and enjoy it over and over again....."
2,Too bad this video doesn't show how good Crazy Horse is.,"I've been a Neil Young fan since the Buffalo Springfield days, and never pass up a chance to enjoy his music if I can. For my money, Neil has more talent, drive, and passion than any 5 ""rock stars"" around today. Thus, I was really looking forward to seeing this video. In a nutshell, the song list sucked, the ""interview"" clips were disjointed and felt contrived, and the overall production seemed weak. The best parts, for me, were the clips from the 70s and 80s, showing the band much more energized and focused. Even Neil looked and sounded old and tired in this overdone drivel. If you are new to Neil and Crazy Horse, PLEASE don't make any judgements based on this video. Instead, listen to all the music they've made, see the earlier video record, and dig Crazy Horse for what is really is: one of the best live rock bands to ever take a stage."
3,Good and Bad,"Whats good about this video is that its Neil Young and band (also Dad) being interviewed. Rarely do we get to see Neil in interview. The live clip of 'Hurricane' from 1976 is amazingly well filmed. However, we only get to see a few moments before it is cut to the BAD parts of this film. The never ending endings. For all the great music that Crazy Horse has recorded with Neil, we are stuck here with NEVER ENDING ENDINGS to the songs. I do recommend this to Neil fanatics but to the curious minded who are not to familiar with his work, this is not a good representation of Neil and Crazy Horse live. Get 'Rust Never Sleeps' instead. A much better performance."
3,year of th hoarse,"A bunch of old dudes jammin. Its cool if you really like Neil, I recommend watching it in intervals."
3,"Eh, what?","This film portrays the darkest side of Neil Young. There is just too much blckness, with no break. Interesting versions of many songs - but certainly not the greatest versions. A true Neil Young fan will enjoy the video, however, the film is a dissapointment."
2,a dud,"For anyone who is a huge fan of Neil Young and director Jim Jarmusch, this film is a stunning disappointment. The footage is uninteresting, and the performances uninspired; the individual interviews are amusing, but in a concert film that should be the aspect that matters least. In the end, the whole thing is just one big frigging waste of time."
4,A must see for the die hard Neiler fan,"This film will grow on you, just like Neil Young does,after you have seen it a few times.Sit back with some old friends,and watch some old friends,Neil, and the always great Crazy Horse,get down and do what they do best,make great rocknroll! From the director of ""Dead Man"" and playing the role of a soda jerk boy from ""Sling Blade"",Jim Jarmusch brings you a gritty look at life on the road with one of the last real guitar heroes, one role that is still vital for Neil Young, and for us,his fans.Hey Hey, My My."
4,"Nicely mastered, but over-edited","I think many of you will agree with me that when you sit down to watch a concert video, you want a concert experience. I think the interviews are bestkept to before and after the concert footage... not mixed in between the songs, disrupting the mood of the event. Other than the breaks in continuity, this is a greatDVD. The sound is awesome, and is worthy for use as a demo disc as well as for entertainment. The video is nicely cinematic. The performance is typical Luther... sheer perfection. It is truly remarkable how his performances sound studio-perfect. Overall: a worthy archive of a masterful vocalist."
3,Luther sings only a few of his songs,This is apretty good DVD but not the classic Luther. It would have been nice to see Luther the way he normally is in concert. Buy this one because it's the only Luther available on DVD.
5,Fantastico!,"As one of many of Luther's No. 1 fans, I love this video! I've watched the concert many times on YouTube but finally ordered my own copy,which came today. Every time Luther came to the Bay Area, my late husband made sure to get great tickets. He always knew he had to share me with my ""other man, Luther!"" I loved Luther from the first time I saw and heard him. LOL This was just supberb! It joins the rest of my Luther collection of his CD's and videos! Oh, and I forgot to add I miss Luther very much and hope he continues to Rest in Peace with his Mom, Dad, sisters and brother."
5,AN EVENING OF SONGS,"I ENJOYED THIS CONCERT DVD, IT WAS VERY GOOD. I LOVE LUTHER VAN DROSS' BEAUTIFUL VOICE, I MISS HIM GREATLY."
1,A misleading book for western readers,"Dr. Anne Birrell does not understand the Chinese text called ""Shan Hai Jing"". She was misled by the Chinese scholars, both ancient and modern and made wrong interpretations of the records in the text. She merely scratched the surface of it and immediately rushed into her own conclusion as stated in the Introduction. The translations of the names of places are wrong and unacceptable. She cannot make use of the figures regarding the distances of the mountains to do calculations, and says that the lands are all imaginery. In fact the landscape described in ""Shan Hai Jing"" is that of Asia during the Cretaceous Period which is 67million years ago but Dr Birrell does not know about it. This translation has no value at all and it will mislead the western readers who cannot read Chinese.Written by C. C. Teng (cryogenic physicist)December 7, 2010, in Kuala Lumpur."
2,"A Surrealist Curiosity. Mirandum, non legendum","The reviews I read here for this book bamboozled me into buying it. I can only assume they are full time academics: no other explanation can be offered for their myopia.The book is admirably done, and the freeish rendering of Chinese mythological names is fine. The difficulty is that this is nothing but an extended catalogue, without stories or plot. It's a list. The descriptions are so unbelievably wierd that it's much fun to read for a page or two, but it's all so much the same, that after two paragraphs you've read it all. To call this a major source for Chinese mythology is simply untrue. Those interested in that subject should get a copy of The Journey to the West, or Chuang Tzu, or the stories of Pu Song Ling. To offer this to the reader as any sort of a narrative is an outright lie.The academic twits who have reviewed this so far do not seem to appreciate that just because a book's content is fictional doesn't make it fiction."
4,A Simply Amazing Guitarist,"Don Ross has recently been added to my A-list of guitarists. This is a short list which includes Leo Kottke, John Fahey, Michael Hedges, William Ackerman and Bill Frisell.Much of this album is solo acoustic guitar, but Ross makes sparing use of additional musicians on some cuts adding soprano sax here, upright bass there, a piano elsewhere. Much of the album is upbeat and funky, like the title track and the infectious ""Bubble Radio."" But there are moments of quiet introspection as on ""June"" and especially the live ""Goodbye Kelly Goodbye,"" the latter inspired by his wife who had recently died of breast cancer at age 43.Fellow Canadian Bruce Cockburn offers this endorsement of Ross: ""Nobody does what Don Ross does with an acoustic guitar. He takes the corners so fast you think he's going to roll, but he never loses control."" RECOMMENDED"
4,ROBOT MUZAK,"don ross is an oustanding acoustic guitarist. most of the songs here are solo pieces played on various alternately tuned 6,7 & 8 string acoustics. his playing at times can floor you and alone he still sounds like a full orchestra. but this isn' t his first outing and he doesn' t show us anything new here. the problem here, is that he seems to be running out of ideas. his weakness, composing, stands out.check out don' s earlier work like 'huron street', 'passion session' and the rare 'this dragon won' t sleep' (features outstanding live version of 'zarzuella'). 'this dargon won' t sleep' also has more playing within small ensembles.despite the above comments, the cd is a very good listen. his earlier work is just far better, he' s that good! if u' ve never heard don' s playing before u'll enjoy 'robot monster'(great title by the way). this type of virtuosity is anomolous!looking forward to don' s new ideas and his development as a composer"
3,"Nice, sweet read.","A good enjoyable, uncomplicated book. Enjoyed reading something that I already knew in that love between a ""yankee"" and a ""rebel"" can work and nicely. The author writes a book that is a cut above many of the paperdoll cutouts on the market today."
1,"Real review, I don't work for the company","This is the most ridiculous waste of money and time. As any real parent knows, kids learn to walk in about a week. After that, you can't strap 'em in fast enough. Why anyone would pay $30 plus S&H for something to use for 10 minutes is beyond me. It's unreasonable to assuming that you're going to walk around like Frankenstein keeping baby from falling. Well, baby needs to learn to fall and get back up...that's how they build up their leg muscles. Secondly, 90% of kids learn to walk while wisking around holding onto the furniture. save your money and back and let jr. learn to walk on their own."
1,Didn't work for us,"Bad design & waste of money. Since there isn't any support in the crotch area, the walking wings tend to slip up under the arms, causing pain. Even if you tighten the straps, it doesn't stop it from slipping. Our daughter was uncomfortable and cried. I wish I had seen the review recommending the Juppy first. That looks great & most of all, supportive & more secure. I'm returning the walking wings and will order the Juppy."
3,little use,"I bought it, but my daughter didn't like. She felt like in a jail or in a small clothes. Good for calm kids."
2,DOn't waste your money,"I have a daughter with CP. I thought this would be good since it has taken us longer for her to learn how to walk and bending down to help her is not fun to do for longer distances. Plus I thought it may help her confidence with walking without having to hold a hand. This thing is really not needed for the typical kid, given the length of time it takes to go from walking with help to walking solo... but for a special needs kid who may be stuck in that phase for a long time like our daughter I thought I'd give it a try. It really was just not helpful. The support it gave her on the mid section was just not enough and once it became enough it wasn't needed at all. Save your money on this one."
2,not useful,"this is not what i expected, the baby hardly ever used it. It might work out for my crippled dog"
5,Cool Wings,"This is so great! Great gift...I recently gave it to one of my best friends and she said her daughter absolutely loves it. No more crying fits over holding hands to walk. It gives the little spitfire a way to get around ""on her own""."
1,My baby hated wearing the walking wings.,"I ordered this product with high hopes that it would get my baby walking. She was born premature and as a result is slightly delayed on her large motor skills. Well, my baby would cry and throw a fit every time I managed to get the walking wings on her. It rode up under her armpits and looked really uncomfortable. She wouldn't even attempt to walk with it on because it was she hated wearing it. If your baby hates being constricted or having a tied-down feeling I would avoid this product. My baby has since learned to walk with persistent practice, help and encouragement from mom and dad...no walking wings needed."
3,Great concept but not quite as good as I thought it would be,"This looked like the perfect thing to help my boy learn how to walk. I was really excited to start using it, and it does work for the most part. The problem is that it rides up under his armpits, no matter how snug we fasten it. It sometimes rides up under his chin as well. This would work better if it had a stap around the legs as well. It does take some time to get the hang of it. I have found, for me, it is easier to just use the arm straps instead of the extention straps. This may be because I am short (although the straps do adjust quite well). On the bright side, my son does like it when I put him in this contraption and let him walk around. He doesn't mind it riding up under his arm pits as much as I do, I suppose."
1,very bad,"very bad, my baby can not find hi balance when we are walking him. he is doing excellent when we are holding hands but not great when we use this product."
4,just what i was looking for!,My 9 mo old has been walking around furniture for months and has been able to stand on his own when distracted. he was terrified to let go. this has given him the confidence he needs to start walking on his own. he has a very small body frame and we have had no problems with it fitting. After the very first time using it he was more willing to stand on his own and actually took his first step on his own. i read lots of reviews of people expecting their 6 mo old to start walking. their balance is not developed enough for those kind of expectations. this has been a great product and i recommend it for anyone in a similar situation.
5,WHAT A HELP,"Although my baby is a little small for the product yet, he does like the assistance he gets & is progressing much quicker. Plus its a back-saver for mom & dad. Great product."
2,Good idea but BIG flaw,"My dad bought this for my 9 month old son who loves to be on his feet and walk or chase around a soccer ball but since so young has very little balance even though he is really strong. After an afternoon of babsitting my dad's back was killing him so he thought this product would be great. My son loved the freedom he got from it and quite literally took off in it, but the problem is that bc it's not secure around the torso it can ride up under the armpits. Once I saw his arms turning purple bc of the blood restriction this caused it went back in the box and was returned. I've ordered the Juppy baby walker which is basically looks like big unerwear with straps so it holds him better without the problems of a torso-only walker. Maybe this would work better with a more cautious walker or one with better balance, but if your kid is like mine and wants to go go go this is probably not the product for you."
2,Works for some... not for us!,"This is one of those products that can be terrific for some people and bad for others. My daughter didn't do well with it at all. It fit awkwardly, and she kept leaning and falling while using it, much more than without it. It got to the point where I felt that it was dangerous to keep trying, so I got rid of it. If you have any way of trying before buying, I'd suggest doing so-- maybe borrow one from a friend to see if your child takes to it."
3,Don't bother,The product itself is very nice. I bought this on inpulse and thought I needed it but I did not and my son did not seem to like the fact that he had something around his body.
4,Pink Walking Wings,"If you're going to buy this for your child, get it early. My daughter was 14 months old when I ordered this. Between the time I placed the order and it arrived, she went from trying to walk to full on walking. When I tried to put the wings on her, she did not want anything to do with it. So... if your baby is close to walking on her/his own or already tottering, don't spend your money. Once they start walking, they don't want the assistance. The only use I have for it now is if we go to an outdoor park which can have some rough, hard ground (its winter) and it helps her navigate uneven ground without falling. Otherwise, I think its very well made and would definitely be of good use to help a baby learn to balance and walk."
2,Not as I had hoped.,"The idea of this product is fantastic, the product itself needs help.I was looking forward to using this, since I am so much taller than my daughter and I have a bad back. I was hoping it would save me from bending over too much while assisting her to walk. The product seemed to raise up on her and would end up under her chin. It would help if there was a strap or something that would go between the legs rather than just go around the torso. The design is a bit flawed. She is starting to walk on her own now and we never did get any use out of this product. Wasted money, at least it wasn't expensive."
3,"Like, but didn't use","I have a bad back, so when I came across this, I couldn't believe it and had to have it. I used it maybe twice, because my son hated it! Too restricting and it's also very hot! I gave it a three because it does the job and if your infant doesn't mind being ""tied up"" and restricted it would be great. Not for us."
4,very useful,"This product was ordered and received within a few days, I purchased this product to help my grand child ""who needed assistance in practicing walking"" it was very helpful......the only reason I gave this product a 4 rating was/is because the ""holding up/assisting ""straps were a little too short and were slightly fatiguing when using it for an extented length of time (maybe for shorter people) it would not be a problem...(Other than that) I still would purchase from amazon anytime in the future....."
1,You Have to Be Kidding Me!!,$30 for this piece of junk?! I read about it in Reader's Digest and thought the author was joking. The little walk behind push toys are so much more useful and a lot cheaper! How is a harness going to give a child independence? SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! NOT WORTH IT!!
5,Gave my baby the confidence to keep walking,"My little girl started taking her first steps at 10 1/2 months, before she even crawled! And she really wanted to keep walking. But a few falls and bumps later, and with daddy hovering anxiously and our backs killing us, she was afraid to keep trying. We got the walking wings and although the first day or two she used them more as a swing, after that she took off! The padded chest area makes her feel like she's being supported so she feels more confident. The straps keep us from having to be hunched over and allow her to run around in areas of our house where we have hard floors, sharp corners, or things we don't want her getting into. It's a win-win. She's almost 13 months now and is a pro at walking and running. We only need them in places where we need to keep a rein (literally) on her mobility and keep her from hurting herself. Lovelovelove this item."
1,Disappointing,I got this item off my gift registry and I was very excited about it at the time. When my daughter turned 8 months old I tried to put it on her and help her with standing up and walking. She did not like it at all and it seemed very uncomfortable!! (see other reviews who gave one star. we had the exact same problems!!) I would not recommend this to anybody! disappointing product!!
2,is ok,My daughter uses this product as a jumping toy more than she does a walking assist. if I had it my way I would get my money back for it. not worth the money I paid for it. I know sad review but it is the truth.
1,It broke immediately,"We were very excited to order the Walking Wings for our 8 month old. As soon as it arrived, we wrapped the walking wings around him, velcroed and snapped it shut, and then went about our first ""walk."" After only 3 steps, my son stumbled forward a bit. His stumble caused one of the fabric straps on the Walking Wings to rip totally off - a clean break at the seam. Our son immediately fell to the ground. Luckily, the fall was not hard, as the other strap remained in place. However, other babies may not be so lucky. We had this product a total of 3 minutes before it broke and put our son in harms way. I would not waste the money."
3,"It's not bad, but there's better out there...","Sometimes, while I'm reading this series, I am interested and excited about the events, but there are a lot of times when I'm just bored. In this volume, Ryoko Mitsurugi and Shinsengumi have to go participate in battles at Dragon Land. While I still think the artwork looks pretty awesome, the panels still feel overcrowded and I'm having problems caring about what happens to the characters. In this book or any of the previous ones, there's never really all that much time devoted to allowing the readers to really get to know and care about the characters. Instead, there are a lot of fights, which, while often fun, aren't enough, at least for me. Judging from some of the reviews I've seen for the other volumes, however, I seem to be in the minority with my opinions about this series."
4,Great Chart,"This chart is an excellent reference tool. As stated by others, the print is indeed tiny. If I wanted to use it during a session with a client, I'd be fumbling for my glasses if I needed to know names of things. However because of the 3-D, I can follow the muscles and see the grain... very useful. I especially like the cut-away work, enabling me to see the different layers of muscle. Great tool, nice quality."
4,Good product,The product looks good on the wall but I had purchased it as a study guide and the labeling is too small to read unless you are standing near the wall which kind of defeated my purpose for buying it. It does look really nice and the labeling is great except for the font size.
5,easy reference,This is great as a wall mounted easy reference. Also have skeletal and nervous system posters. I bought this for another provider (an anesthesiologist) because he kept coming in my office to use mine!
4,Scientific applications focus,"A good combination of the theory of fractals along with its application in several diverse fields, like percolation clusters. Vicsek covers the familiar geometric objects like Julia sets and Sierpinski gaskets. The book is not focused on the fancy computer graphics applications. Instead, it looks at scientific phenomena like a hierarchical network of resistors and how a distribution of voltage drops shows multifractal scaling.He gives extensive coverage of cluster growth models and how these square with various observations and simulations.Very understandable to both theorists and experimentalists. Made more useful by lengthy lists of references at the end of each chapter, to journal papers."
5,This book is excellent! A must have!,I received this book in December 1998 at Yule Tide from my sister. It has been a great addition to my library and there is a great amount of information about just about any momentous life event. I recommend this book to everyone.
4,Good for those in need!,"I came across this book shortly after my father passed on. It was invaluable to me. It helped me recognize many things. Most of all that he wasn't gone, just in a different plane of existence. This is a must for any who walk this path!"
2,not a lot of helpful info,I wasn't too impressed with this book; bought it for my end-of-life planning business but I didn't find much helpful info in it.
3,Found this book lacking.,"I've done quite a lot of reading and experiencing of death the past few years, recently buying Starhawks book for reference. There are some nice rituals for the pagan community or self healing, but nothing that covered the ritual of dying and how to work a ""death watch."" I would not recommend this book as the only reference guide to anyone who I wish to help me pass on into the next life. It was written more as a healing tool for the authors than as a guide for pagans (or so it seemed). If you are not going read any other book on death, then this should serve you well."
5,Will use it again and again.,I can't say enough good about this book. Thank the goddess there is a book from a Pagan perspective. That celebrates the diversity of pagan belief and addresses loss and death. From how to help children deal with the loss of a loved one (bird or teacher or...) to how to conduct a home-made cremation to mourning rituals and healing songs to advice for being with a loved one who is dying. My only complaint is that it isn't long enough. Deep enough. Hopefully it is only the first volume of future books...
5,A Special Gift to Community,I gifted a copy of this book to the Pastoral Care department of the children's hospital where I work. It was received with open minds and hearts. Pagan children and families face the same trials as those who walk other paths. This book will serve to support those in my community. It belongs on EVERY Pagan's bookshelf...it's on mine!Tyla
2,Disorganized facts,"Peter Harclerode clearly did a tremendous amount of research on Western paramilitary operations, but the book he ended up with is practically useless as a history source. The chapters are not divided into stages of the campaign. There is no explanation of why an operation was carried out, what the strategy was, or even which side had the upper hand. Instead, it's just 590 pages of tactics organized more or less by date. Can you imagine the US Civil War being described this way? The maps don't help either; they are from a stock source and don't show half of the locations mentioned in the text. I haven't memorized the geography of Tibet, help me out! Maybe Harclerode will get a chance to make another edition that addresses these problems, so his work won't have been wasted."
4,"Complete, but too much info!","This is a very complete book on tennis. Not a book to learn from, though, because it has so much information. If you already play well and would like to know the game's history as well as other techniques (and look at lots of pictures of past great players), this is the perfect book."
1,Not the Best!,"I purchased this product for hair growth and breakage. After about 2 months of regular use, it has done nothing. No additional lenght, or thickness. I have some bald areas and was hoping for some new growth. This product has a very strong smell, in fact the 1st time I used it, I was a little dizzy do not buy."
1,VIRGO not Virgin hair fertilizer,I wouldn't even give the product one star but since I have to..The VIRGIN hair fetilizer worked wonders on my hair when I used it but this is the VIRGO hair fertilizer and they took the herbal extracts mixture out and threw in african shea butter...DO NOT buy from this seller. Go somewhere else until you the real VIRGIN hair fertilizer!!!
1,Only deserves one star for right now.,"Okay, so one of my friends were telling me about this product VIRGIN and how great it is. So I decided to order it on amazon. I was so excited about my shipment. When I received it and open up the package, both of my boxes say VIRGO. I don't like this false advertisement. The picture that is shown above clearly shows the name brand VIRGIN. I know the title says it wears a new name but once again I go back to the picture it doesn't say that. They should really update the picture so people could know what they are buying instead of just putting that it wears a new name. Of course once I saw the name Virgo I came on amazon to check out everyone's reviews and see what they all had to say about this. I see a lot of positive feedback even though its not the real stuff. So I'm going to try it out and be back with a an updated review. Once again please change the picture."
4,Good,Don't like the smell but overall it makes my hair feel and look healthier. I've got Asian hair and it works great on my hair.
2,new user,"have not had this product long and have not got to use it regularas of yet, that's why i gave a 2"
4,the best stuff ever for growing african american hair/ball spots,Love virgin hair. I had bald spot in the front and some in the back. After using this product for 3 weeks consistently my hair grew and grew and is still growing. It has a smell which some people find bold. It doesn't bother me. My hair is thicker and heavy because of this product. I can't live without it and nither will my hair. The vendor sent it to me right away and I appreciate it so much. Please keep This product works for real. Exspecially for african american hair types. Trust me I'm a nurse.Thank God for this stuff.P.Sbe careful not to get in eyes.
5,Excellent product,"I love this product, it was first given to me by a friend after running out had to find more"
4,Cheap & Effective,I started finding these kind of product when I lost lot of hair after dyed my hair color.After the first time I used it my hair coming back to life. It been smoother and I lost less hair.However I didn't love my color so I did another dyed my hair color.This time I lost less amont of hair than the first time. I use Chi infusion and leave on for 2 week.My hair didn't smooth like before which make me believe that this product is really work with my hair.I came back to use it. the reason I cut one star is the smell. I have to choose day that I will be home all day so I can use it.The smell is so ....I had checked with the company and this seller it is the same product with virgin brand.
4,It's working,I've been using this product for a month and it really works my hair was very damage in the top now it's healthy looking and growing.
4,Virgin Hair Fertlizer,"Work well on the hair, it has made a differnce in my hair. The thin spot in my hair are thickening and hair is healthier.The only hang-up is the smell, use it litely.virgin hair fertilizer now wears a new name (2 pc pack)"
3,Hair Fertilizer,I received my order on time. The company sent the order as I ordered it. I can't say if the product works or not because it has a scent to it that I can't take. I have only used the product one time so I guess I haven't used it enough to make a fair review but the business that sold it I would do business with again.
4,HAIR GROWTH YES!,"I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT ABOUT A MONTH AGO. I APPLY IT DAILY, THE SMELL IS NOT UNBEARABLE! I HAVE SEEN SOME HAIR GROWTH AROUND MY TEMPLES. ONLY DOWNFALL IS THAT IT MAKES MY SCALP ALITTLE DRY. BUT I JUST THINK ITS BECAUSE ITS WINTER AND I HAVE DRY SKIN USUALLY. BUT I BOUGHT A SCALP GREASE TO ADD WITH VIRGIN AND I HAVE FELT A DIFFRENCE. ILL KEEP USING THE PRODUCT UNTIL ALL 3 TUBES THAT I BOUGHT ARE DONE! AND THEN ILL REVIEW AGAIN"
4,Entertaining,"The main character is a character that you hate to love. He has made such a mess of his life. As things get worse, he continues to make such bad choices. Despite the bad choices, the dumb things he does, I still couldn't help but like him.<P...The book is tight enough that the ending remains a surprise. I would recommend it."
4,"Great book, intriguing!!!!!",Good Book!!!! Those of you from Florida or who have ever been in Tallahassee will have a great time reading.
5,Lovely Addition to our Kitchen...,"Aesthetically this is the toaster I was looking for without such an enormous price tag. It blends wonderfully with my KitchenAid Mixer, same finish on the red panels, so it's as if I'd always planned the arrangement. The appearance is ""professional"", however this toaster DOES turn off when not in use. The perfect aide in responsible parenting! Don't know how a person could go wrong with this appliance choice. Many other colors are available to choose from and it's a nice option to replace plastic or polished stainless models which always tend to appear grubby after handling. Enjoy your toasting moments!"
3,Ok- reasonable beach read,"This book could have been better. The lead character and his partner are interesting enough but essentially stock characters-- the damaged but brilliant cop and his sexy sidekick. It would be interesting to see if they're better developed in future books. The story could be set anywhere- Scotland could be Cleveland or South Florida for all the part it plays. And the mystery itself is overly complicated and not difficult to figure out. The real challenge is trying to keep the subplots and characters sorted out-- too many minor players have too much time in the book. Rather than allowing them to be introduced and then developed over several books, the author seems to want to introduce and flesh out everyone right from the beginning.That all said, I've read much worse and if you read quickly and don't mind a few glitches, it's worth an afternoon."
4,Great synopsis of the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible),"In his book, Mr Berrier does a book-by-book overview of the entire Old Testament. He writes in plain English so that anyone with an average reading level can understand what the Bible says. I enjoy this book because I am a Bible College student and I can refer to this book when I need to cram for a Bible test."
4,All but one of the stories are top-flight!,"Weber's Honor Harrington series is a delight even to those of us who don't particularly like military series. The difference is that Weber draws detailed characters on all sides of an issue. His two short stories in this collection continue that tradition, as do his fellow authors. If I had a problem with any of these stories, it was with Green's tale of the Peeps and Manties. The details were overdone and the characterization, the thing I most love about Honor, is found in bits and pieces throughout the book. Still, I would recommend it to anyone wanting more background on Honor's universe. In fact, I would like to see more stories about Stephanie Harrington and Queen Adrienne."
3,what is wrong with this book?,"I find it hard to understand the other comments regarding Weber's skill at characterization. If there is anything that defines these books it is that his characters are completely flat, except for the tree cats which are just too cute and purrsome to take seriously.The stories were OK, some better than others. But without the sweeping Tom Clancy elements of the regular Harrington books, it seems rather, well, pointless.The best thing about Echoes Of Honor is that he is finally giving his heroes some worthwhile opponents, instead of the cardboard evildoers from the first few novels.The stories in this book are generally a step backwards in that regard."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A range of stories, from a murder investigation, to a military conflict, and an actual princess-with-cat tale (but no pony :)). None of them are particularly good.Worlds of Honor : The Stray - Linda EvansWorlds of Honor : What Price Dreams? - David WeberWorlds of Honor : The Queen's Gambit - Jane LindskoldWorlds of Honor : The Hard Way Home - David WeberWorlds of Honor : Deck Load Strike - Roland J. GreenTreecat partner murder revenge.3.5 out of 5Got to check out those humans, boss.3 out of 5Royalty more fun with smart furries.3 out of 5Get out of my way you fracking fool, I have an avalanche to rescue people from.3.5 out of 5Planetary dispute with guns.2.5 out of 52.5 out of 5"
3,Linda's story is worth the price of the book.,"The first story is wonderful. Linda could write worthy of Anne McCaffrey or Larry Niven if this story was continued. Go for the big time Linda! Write a great saga for us!The rest of the book trails off and is a real comedown from Linda's story. Tries to hold together with a very thin device of stepping through time, but fails badly.Stars? Hard to say. The book is a no-stars, but Linda's story is a 5 star. So three."
1,Where's the shade?!!,"11/20/09 - I just received this item, which I ordered for my sister's birthday. There's no shade! The picture on Amazon shows a shade, the Amazon description specifically mentions the shade (""12"" diameter white Shantung shade""), the box itself has a picture of a lamp with a shade, WHAT'S WITH THAT?! I will be contacting Amazon/Bargain Outfitters and returning this item if they can't provide a shade. Very disappointing, especially since this was a birthday gift.update: I contacted Amazon and Bargain Outfitters and they responded immediately, stating that a shade will be sent immediately. When I receive the shade, I will update and (presumably) increase the stars for this review."
3,Phrase Book is useful.,"very adequate phrase book. Several phrases for various situations. I found it helpful on my trip to Bandung in January. I would have liked a little more language instructional features,"
5,Cherrished Memories,This is a wonderful little book!Instill common sense in your self and children. Bring back memories to your Grandfather and Grandmother. This is a wonderful little collection! It is my understanding that these are from the little words of Wisdom that Johnny Gruelle had published in the paper. Simply fantastic!I got 2 - one to keep and one to share!
3,Fit was not accurate.,"It was just ok. Color was good, pic matches shorts, but fit was too small. Order one size up from what you think you are."
3,Different Approach to Bach,"Wispelwey's approach to this music is valid, and his sound is uniformly excellent. However, his treatments of these preludes and dances are a little quirky for my taste in terms of rhythmic organization, and Wispelwey's approach tends to remain on the surface of the music. If you want an excellent, straightforward version, the references by Casals and Fournier provide better alternatives. However, if you are looking for a different approach and tend to like your Bach light and sprightly rather than dark and meditative, then this may be the album for you. Excellent sound."
3,Good flashlight. Amazon over price.,I bought mine at Walmart for $14.47 regular price instead of near $25 in this Amazon.
2,Ok people i'll try to make this short and sweet.,"This DVD was somewhat of a disappointment. I expected great things having purchased the hilarious first edition. First off, there was only one comedian (save cedric) who actually made me laugh as opposed to just chuckle, he was the first comedian to be presented by Cedric. Secondly, even Cedric himself whom I rate very highly wasn't as funny as I have know him to be. Lastly, The show is just under an hour long..........what the heck is that about?. In short if you are someone how is satisfied with mediocrity then by all means...........Allez-y."
1,"Cedric, your guests 'act funny'!","Don't waste your time. Cedric is talented, he's hilarious but appears all of ten minutes. The rest of the time you are subjected to his guest comics. One of them had a (singular) good line. Every remaining second I spent wondering if Cedric brought on these absolutely lame comedians to make himself look good. Their routines were juvenile, incoherent and definitely amatuer. I write this review hoping to discourage people from buying and therefore discourage such inane and tasteless humor from comedians of neglible talent. Don't waste your money! Instead getCedric's ""Taking you higher"". It is classy, inteligent humor that will have you laughing so hard it hurts."
4,Better than volume 1! 4/12 stars,"I decided to check this out because I had seen the first ""Starting Line Up"",plus I love the Platinum Comedy Series.Cedric's performance on here is funnier than ever.I love his jokes about Snoop Dogg.I hate Snoop,so I was glad to hear someone make fun of him.The other comedians on here are funny also.The first comedian on here,Leon Rogers,makes fun of the music I like,but he is hilarious!I love his impression of DMX.The second comic,Nema Williams,is not funny at all.I am white,so I like white comics,but I hated the way he was telling all black jokes to get laughs.The third comedian on here,Rodney Perry,was funny,but he cussed WAY too much.The last comedian on here is Prescott.He was funny,but again, he cussed WAY too much.This is better than Volume 1,but not as good as ""D.L. Hughley Live"" or Dave Chappelle's ""Killin Them Softly""."
4,Excellent videos,I watched lynda.com's AE 6 videos and watched this one - and this really is better - Although the same in length - much more details are given. A good example would be the mothion paths curves which are not covered in lynda's videos.I feel better with Nathan's instruction.I give it 4 stars only as I know Total Training series are the best around - although too expensive for me.
1,"Trash flick that has nothing to do with the ""Dead"".",This movie was a waste of time. The film has a totaly missleading title. The Discription on the back didnt even have anything to do with the movie. There isnt one zombie! Plus there is almost no violence or gore! It shouldnt even be a horror movie!
1,Worst Movie!,This is the worst movie. I think 1 person died and he had heart attack. There isn't one zombie in this movie. There is no point in this movie. Don't rent this movie.
1,BEWARE!!!!,"This film contains zero zombies. The artwork is a very feeble attempt to get you to buy this. If you're a zombie fan, you WILL be disappointed. There is no gore. No zombies. Nothin good here. If you want some boring horror movie w/ no blood n guts, this may be your ticket. BUYER BEWEARE!!!!"
1,mass disappointment,"i can't believe that a movie like this actually got made. to put it plainly, the title is completly misleading. if a movie is going to imply zombies, there had better be some f*#%ing zombies in it! on the cover, it shows some zombies busting through the streat, but in all reality, those are the only ones in the entire flick. sure, there's something at the end that i can only guess is a zombie, but in the not even two minutes it has, it's hard to tell. the real title for this crap should be 'a guy gets a used typewriter and tries to find who had it before him'. this is the only movie i've ever watched in fast-forward mode. the only reason i gave this thing one star is because i had to give it something. it's not even worth that one. my advice to you, don't listen to those people who give this five stars, because i can garentee you they are the only ones who feel that way. if you don't want your money, burn it before getting this. you'll get more out of it."
1,The title is misleading...,"...don't be fooled by this movie. The only reason I bought it was because I thought, due to the cover and name, that it was going to be a zombie movie. It is not. Apparantly it got renamed by U.S. distributors or what not, but it has nothing to do with zombies. The reason for the low rating is because I expected a zombie movie due to the name, cover, and quote on the top of the case. Well I lost interest in this fairly quickly after seeing no zombies at all. If you are looking for a zombie flick here stay clear, as it has nothing to do with them, if you are looking for the movie ""Zeder"" or whatever it is called then you found it. I was looking for a zombie movie, didn't get it so hence the one star."
1,It Stinks!,This movie was the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever!The cover has nothing to do with the movie.There is no gore or blood at all.The title has nothing to do with the movie.The most im protant thing is ....NO ZOMBIES!Thats right you heard me no dead corpses walking around and eating people just some stupid old guy.My advice do not buy or even rent ths movie.I was suckered by the cover so I wa stupid and rented it.Lemme tell ya its the worst excuse for a movie never mind a horor movie. My 2 words for this movie are: Stay Away!
1,this movie should be called the man and the type wrighter,How can a movie with such a cool cover be so horrible. The cover has three zombie son it and there is like two in the movie who do nothing. Most of this painfully boring movie is a man playing with his type wrighter. Yep deffinately exciting. I would recommend to bye this movie to break or to torture some one. So pretty much just stay away if u buy it gos help u cuz i was a victim and the pain still stays.
1,"This would be great, if it worked...","I purchased two of these. Both leak through the valve stem and are useless. I'm no valve expert, but perhaps running some water through these to see if they leak would be a good quality control check for the Chinese manufacturer. The ones I received were in boxes labeled Four Seasons."
3,Pink pills,Note on bottle says you may not notice a difference for a while. Maybe never in my case....I have not used it long enough I guess.
5,"The sound is way more ""swamplike"" here...","Yes, they call themselves swamp metal, which is indeed a close representation. The vocalist here sounds more mechanical, which is a good thing and the music is very atmospheric. Yet, the intensity is still there, although their previous albums ""They Will Return"" and ""Swamplord"" are even more intense and furious. However, there is something new here that I can't quite explain. It's just so catchy and you will come back for more. Get any of their albums, as you will be impressed."
4,Great but alot like CoB,"They sound really awesome but they also sound exactly like Children of Bodom, the whole Finish melodic metal scene that uses lots of keyboards. They still kick ass though."
5,"Extreme, some of the only greatest music today!","Looking around on Amazon I came across this so called Kalmah and downloaded a song elsewhere and was blown away. Just bought Swampsong and it is such amazing cd. I'm not a big fan of death metal but Kalmah knows how to do it. Cloned Insanity is a great song. If you like these guys then you'll like Children of Bodom, and vice versa.Buy it and rock"
3,Good background read on HST,"Frankly, I enjoyed the atsropolitics perspective of the Hubble Space Telescope [HST] but several people that were associated with the project I have spoken dispute elements of the book on a factual basis. Nonetheless, I see facts as being taken from where one stands especially in political science and the art of spin. For anyone doing an overview study of the Hubble Space Telescope, this book should be among those to be read for insight to the early development issues associated with a 'Big Science' project. The HST has, fortunately, been a significant instrument in astronomy the past decade or so. Hopefully the 2008 service mission will extend its life several more years leaving more to the HST story to be told with many more pictures and words to be written as to its astronomical observations."
5,Great reading for anyone interested in astronomy,"If you've ever wondered what went wrong, and more importantly, what went right with the Hubble Space Telescope, this is a book for you. The author describes many of his personal experiences and gives us folks on the outside a peek at how professional astronomers work. Also, he corrects some of the errors that were made by the newsmedia in the early days of the project"
1,A Great Novel,"``Hubble Wars'' is a great exciting read, but unfortunately it has little to do with anything that really happened. Chaisson's tone reads like that of a classic self-serving political memior, ``I was there. I saw everything. It's a shame that the fools didn't listen to me, because I alone knew what to do.'' In truth, Chaisson gets the details completely wrong in many places, fails to understand what people were really doing to save the mission, and represents a privileged vantage point that he in fact did not have. I have yet to meet anyone who had anything to do with the Hubble who considers this book to be a fair or accurate history. Chaisson's tone is vividly clear in the summary chapter in which he judges the profoundly successful 1993 repair mission to having fallen far short. There is a great history of the Hubble to be written, but this is not it."
4,Fabulous,"This is a one of a kind; a masterpiece of people trying/struggling to stay afloat in the midst of terrible sorrow--and show they do that is the premise of the book. And the fact that they grow up to be good people despite the odds gives us all hope. Read this and you will be changed. Because it cost me nothing, I expected it to be worth that...and it isn't; Its one of the best books ia have read this year."
5,Poignant story of loss and healing....,"Although I purchased this book awhile ago, I just recently got to finish it. Poignant story of a boy's loss of his father and becoming a man. Told with sensitivity and humor, Steinberg invites the reader to share the emotions with his well written prose.I spent my '60's in the Boston area, but Chicago didn't sound very different, and I enjoyed being taken back to a more innocent and kinder time in our society.The Widow's Son is one such example."
3,A bit long . . .,"First of all, I will say this was a good book. I loved hearing about things that happened ""back in the day."" That said - it was too long. I know there was an editor, but there were stretches that were so long and involved that I nearly put the book down.There was some good imagery: ""We're like a piano keyboard, with its highest key far to the right squeaking like a mouse, and the key on the far left end thumping as deep as elephant farts."" This sentence was used to describe how the boys lined up in a gym class.The way the author described death in the minds of children was very good, too.When I was growing up in the 1960's, we didn't have ""backpacks"" but carried a book satchel. All the other things seemed true to the time period - the saddle shoes, the TV, the way kids played.Good book with some editing."
2,widow son,this just should have been cleaned up and done a a children's book . too draggy. children may enjoy this book but adults do not.
3,Boring,"This book was pretty boring. It just didn't seem to go anywhere. I never give up on a book so continued to read it, but it took much longer than usual because it was difficult to keep going. I kept waiting for it to get better."
4,Hits Home,"This is a wonderful read, made more powerful by the fact that I grew up about 15 minutes from the setting during the same time period. The emotions of a kid as he grows into manhood ring true and kept me turning pages."
2,Not at all engaging,I was disappointed in this book. I typically love stories from this era but I found it choppy and it took effort to stayed engaged in the story.
5,Brilliantly written!!! A required read!!!,"The Widow's Son is a touchingly, brilliant story as real as most of it's readers will ever find. I'm a member of the ""dead-father's club"", and Steinberg's depiction of the thoughts, fears, and emotions that are experienced by grieving children is on target every time. I usually breeze through books, but read this one very slowly...deliberately...and carefully. Steinberg reminded me of the feelings I had as a child, and put them into words more beautifully than I could have ever expressed. Anyone who lost thier dad at a too early age needs to read this book. It will make them laugh, it will touch their hearts, and it will make them cry - for the loss of youth that all ""dead-father kids"" experience."
5,A treat for all intelligent readers,"This was an excellent story that got into the heads of adults and children alike. How a family copes with a loss is delicately and meticulously outlined. Also, truth will out and people do adjust. Just a wonderfully written story of a family coping."
2,More of the same thing,"While I am a new believer in the love and logic approach to parenting, I feel this audio tape is just a ""greatest hits"" of the Parenting with Love and Logic book. I need more support, not reruns of stories I've already heard. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't make this purchase."
2,"Go Viking, go Viking, go!","These artists do not know how to spell or use proper grammar, but they are good for a laugh, hence they get two stars. Imagine pressing the demo button on your 80's synth and growling about Norse mythology... there is your dose of Valhalla Ice.Awesomely bad. Do not spend more than $2 on this CD."
2,It didn't work,"I bought this to change over an older Legend crossbow, from the adjustable sight in the rear with light pin in front, to a crossbow scope and it didn't fit the legend right. We had to grind down the back end and I still have a trip to a bow shop in my future."
3,Needs some adjusting,"I needed this piece of metal to slide in place as an adapter for my Horton 175HD crossbow. The Lite Rite red dot scope that came installed on the bow finally quit working after 5 years of use. I called Horton directly and visited their website to find a replacement or get the adapter because I received a Horton brand red dot scope from a friend. Horton wanted to charge me $50 for this piece of metal and then $15 in shipping. I looked on Amazon and found it for 1/2 as much (including shipping)! However, after taking the adapter to my local Bass Pro to have it properly installed and trying to install it on my own, it still needed some major adjusting due to the adjustable knob on the stock of the bow that can help level/accomodate for different shooting distances/angles. I had to shimmy the adapter in place and then adjust the scope dots until I was able to get 2 inch groupings."
4,I'd give it 4.5 if I could...,Solid and well made item...but no installation instructions whatsoever. I had to resort to the web of course...but it only took me a few minutes to find that the cross bolt is self tapping and the only bolt needed to install this after pulling off my fixed sight on my Tacoma 150.I reused the spring that was under it as well.Took me about 10 minutes total time and included installing my red dot sight.They should ship all bows with this instead.
3,Amazon xBow scope base review,"The base was what I needed; however, I had to drill out the hole a little in order for the OEM pin that held the old open scope in place. It wasn't a bid deal and in the end I was able to mount the scope as needed to get the job done. I appreciated having the scope on my crossbow!"
3,It does run small.,"Arrived quickly, and looks to be great quality... it does run small in length of torso."
3,Runs 2 sizes Small,"I wear a size 8 jeans. When I read the other reviews, I decided to order a Large (sz 12-14) since they run small. I just received them and the Larges are too tight. I really like the looks and quality construction of them. I would order the next larger size, but they are not avaiable. So I just have to return them."
2,Ski Bib,"It was way too big so sent it back! Read the others' reviews and since I am a medium size, I ordered the large due to the inseam. Well it's made for someone who would need an XL!"
2,arctix women's ski bib,"These run very small to size. Ordered an XL and it was way to small. The Bib portion comes to low for my liking, it rides low hip and I'd like it up above the waist to keep snow out. I have to return this item."
3,Just What They All Said,"Just like everyone said in their previous posts...these do run small. Based on the reviews, I bought a large for my daughter who is 5'4"" and 134lbs. They fit her perfectly in the legs, but with the straps on over her shoulders she got a wedgie everytime she bent over. Still, they seemed to be of good quality and served my daughter well for sledding every now and then."
3,Buyer beware!,"Just like most other reviewers stated, these run extremely small! I am 5 feet 5 inches tall and weigh 125 lbs. I typically wear a ladies small/medium or a size 6. I figured I would get a medium in these to accomodate for bulky clothing underneath. They were really short in the torso and were pretty tight, so I had to go up to the large size. They are good pants, but the sizes are all wrong... I would recommend trying different sizes to find the right fit."
2,Don't waste your money,"Don't get me wrong, I am a committed Peter Frampton fan, but this short-changes him and cannot be described as his very best. It's just a collection of 10 songs, some of which were hits, some not. Without a doubt much of his very best work never made it on to this album. If you want a single-CD collection of his work, go for 'Greatest hits', but much better by far is the 2CD compilation 'Shine on' which contains 30 tracks, covers his career much more effectively, and is very good value."
1,Wheel lock remover,Very limited usage. Does not specify exact measurement on lug nuts. Was really disappointed. Should have a list of specific lug nut for the product to be used.
1,Does not work on locking lug nuts,I bought this to remove locking lug nuts on a Honda Oddessy. Neither socket fits. Both are too big. This tool would work fine on regular (non-locking) lugs that have been striped.
5,great!,"Fantastic!! It works well with my ps2 set up, and there is enough cord to place the system anywhere. Great quality feel!!"
3,A lovely Story,So this one of those I'm still thinking about how I feel with this story. I liked. I enjoyed getting to know Susie (more then the movie portrayed). There were even some characters in the book that I liked more now that I read the story. This story could almost hit a 4 star for me but it just had something that I can't put my finger on that I did not like about it. Still a great story to read for all ages. It's an exciting look into the world of heaven.
5,Amazing book,"I bought this book after i watched the movie, I tend to do that as usually the book is better in most cases.I loved both the movie and the book. I have read this book 4 times, and yes im a guy and straight lol."
3,A Tad Disappointing,"I read this book with great expectations, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. I expected much more.I don't know if I want to think of my deceased loved one's lurking about, unless, of course, they have unfinished business. The MC in this story definitely had unfinished business, but was never allowed to finish it. It really ruined the whole story for me. Perhaps if she'd been able to help in some way, it would have made a difference, but as it was, the story fell completely flat.This book disagreed with me so much, I refused to even watch the movie. I give it 3 stars because the writing is impeccable. I give 3 stars to the brilliant editing and 1 star for the lack-luster story."
2,A (Somehow) Unmoving Story About Murder,"Everyone raved about this book. I was told by multiple people that I just HAD to read it. I finally read it and am completely underwhelmed.More than anything, this book feels like it was written for the Lifetime Network crowd: people (primarily women) who have a morbid fascination with bad things happening to other people. The story had a chance to put a unique spin on an oft-told tale, but instead it was completely uninspired and felt like it should be sandwiched between a story about a woman who was attacked and wheelchair bound but still won a gold medal and a story about a woman who gets up the courage to finally leave her cheatin', beatin', drinkin' husband.Nothing about this story moved me one way or the other. I didn't feel hatred or love. I didn't cry or laugh. It was a complete waste of my time."
4,Definitely different...,"This book was interesting to me in some ways, and confusing to me in others. Watching the people below, growing and changing was neat, nut I didn't understand the concept of the 'individual' heavens and things like that. Also, towards the end, my mind was beginning to wonder; like it was starting to draw on...but besides that, it was a great book!"
2,Not enough written substance to hold my attention,"This book was not half as good as I expected it to be. It starts out interesting (with pain and tragedy), but the next 4/5ths of the story is boring, dissected, and with poor character development. I kept reading, still hoping for some interesting descriptions, characters, or closure. I remained disappointed. The ending has one gem of interest, which I enjoyed, however, I would not recommend this book.I have now seen the movie, The Lovely Bones, and enjoyed that much more than the book. Surprising, I know! I would recommend the movie."
4,The Lovely Bones,I received the book I ordered in a timely fashion and was pleased with the condition of the book for not being new. I would purchase from this seller in the future if they have an item I am interested in.
2,Interesting but overrated,"I just finished this book and it took me 2 1/2 weeks (quite a long time for the page length). I, of course, read it because it seemed all of America was doing the same thing. The point of view was interesting, and the story of the grieving family kept my attention. However, for the most part I couldn't wrap myself around this one. Perhaps there were too many subplots and minor characters.Also my expectations may have been too high, but the book seemed to really slog along with really very little accomplished. Also, the ""possession"" and the icicle at the end were very anti-climatic.I think a movie of this book would be a real mistake (think Shipping News) but will probably be inevitable."
1,Insipid book,"Even the dullest teen would people heaven with more imagination than Susie. I picked up this book hoping it would be at least as good as her husband's recent novel, Carter Beats the Devil which was imaginative, and in places quite deft.When she's not forcing the language and imagery, Alice Sebold has got the characters acting on unexplained impulses which baffle and perturb the reader. It feels like it was written in a seminar course and that too many ideas were developed by the group, and then dropped by the writer who couldn't commit. The author's handling of dialogue was particularly clumsy.By the time Susie returns to Earth for a tryst with her sweetie the reader is incredulous at how lame the ending is shaping up to be. Save yourself the time and money and wait until the movie comes out. It will be a big hit with teenagers everywhere."
2,"lovely, shmovely","After reading this novel, I couldn't help but wonder, why did Alice Sebold bother? This read like a rough draft with some much needed editing. Frankly, it seemed contrived & tired and unneccessarily brutal. However, the hokey back-to-earth experience and the family reunited proved that even though Sebold tried to work on a tough subject she couldn't leave the ""happy ever after"" mentality behind. Make up your mind and quit with the blather, I say."
1,"Overly Hyped, Underly Entertaining",I bought this due to the hype and found it written in the style of the 14 year old protagonist. Unless you like middle school drivel save your money and buy a book worth reading.
3,an uneven account of life and death...,"'The Lovely Bones' by Alice Sebold is a rather unusual book. It is narrated by the ghostly (or perhaps better said, 'angelic') spirit of a murdered teenaged girl. She tells the story of her murder (..not too gruesome) and how it had affected the lives of her family and friends. This might sound fine but it's not, or at least not entirely.The book starts off somewhat moody and dark, as we understand how the narrator was killed. Very reminiscent of 'Being Dead' by Jim Crace (... a rather good book). But then the book switches gears and becomes more of a domestic drama (her family breaks up, her sister falls in love, etc). And it eventually evolves into a spiritual ""touchy feely"" mess, much like the movie 'Ghost' (okay, it wasn't a bad movie). So after starting out rather well 'The Lovely Bones' goes downhill. The ending was very anti-climatic.Bottom line: a book that should have very good turns out to be unexceptional. Not recommended."
2,Yawn!Yawn!,"It would be impossible to count the number of books I have read over the years but I could count on one hand how many I have read to the half way mark then couldn't be bothered to finish - this was one of them. It's such an intriguing idea for a novel yet so little was made of it. It seemed to lack energy and just came across as half-soaked.I kept waiting for it to rev up but after reaching the half way mark only to find it still as ineffectual, I lost interest completely. A work colleague finished reading it but I couldn't even work up the curiosity to ask her what had happened in the end, such was my apathy regarding this novel."
2,Admit it: it's overhyped,"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is not a bad book per se, it's just not a good book. The central action revolves around a family trying to heal itself following the murder of one of its daughters.To Sebold's credit, the ""heaven"" scenes are quite well done (e.g., dogs playing and kids with friends and swingsets) and these, in my opinion, are the most appealing portions of the book.However, this is not enough. The Lovely Bones has the emotional depth of a Judy Blume book, yet somehow has managed to generate enough hype to mask itself in a patina of ""serious literature."" Hats off to the Publishers, I suppose."
2,SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY,What am I missing? Why such great reviews? I stopped reading it about 50 pages from the end - forcing myself to try to finish it. I gave up. So disappointing! It just didn't go anywhere. The characters weren't interesting enough. There are too many other good books out there to waste my time on this one.
3,Lost momentum about two-thirds through,"Great start. At one point found it difficult to put down. In the beginning the characters were very carefully thought out and quite believable. What had me completely turning pages was watching how the grieving family dealt with MR Harvey, the killer, living in the neighborhood as a free man. But the book seemed to lose coherance about the time he left the neighborhood. Characters started to act in ways I found unconvincing....the ""falling out of heaven"" and overly sentimental reveries reminded me of bad soap opera with a ghost....."
1,Totally overrated.,"This book should have been classified as a ""young adult"" novel, not adult fiction. The writing is larded with dreadful cliches and pedestrian observations. If the author had not used the ""novel"" device of dead girl as narrator, this book would have attracted no notice whatsoever. That's the only bit of originality, and a slender reed it is."
5,What a great book!,I was listened to it as a book on CD while driving and couldn't wait to get back in the car to listen! What a great book!
4,Well written book!,"I thought this was a very well written book. It was a book that I had ""heard"" about for the past couple of years and just hadn't gotten around to reading yet. It is worth reading. It is sad, but very thought provoking. The best book that I have read this summer!"
1,Disturbing,"The only word I can use to describe this book, is ""disturbing."" This author obviously has some serious emotional issues that she needs to deal with."
5,Loved it,"I loved this book - it was so different than anything I've read before - the whole idea of a young girl writing about her murder from heaven. It was heartbreaking, funny, warm, so many things. I would highly recommend it."
3,Almost Forgetable,"I was looking for some light summer reading and purchased this book based on the reviews. I thought the premise was something unique and couldn't wait to start. It didn't match up to the reviews. Not much character development and the story jumped from scene to scene without any clear direction. The ending just sort of arrived, like the author was running out of things to say. Overall, I'm glad I read it, but wait until someone like me lends you the book before you spend any money."
4,Better than expected,"I didn't plan on reading this book because of all the hype around it, but I skimmed over the first chapter and haven't stopped. Perhaps it's a little more compelling because the Everytown, USA Susie's story is set in is filled with the names of places I knew growing up."
1,Another Lifetime Special turned novel,"I'm not going to repeat much of what has been said already. In short the writing of this book seemed forced. The premise, much like the rape in the novel ""Kite Runner"" really was just another shock value device in order to give the author an opportunity to ramble on about, quite frankly, a not very interesting childhood."
5,Great Novel,"This was by far one of the best books I have ever read. I sat down and started reading it one night, and could not put it down. It was exciting, and full of surprises and suspense."
2,shallow sentimentality,"I picked up this novel on a whim in the ""summer reading"" section at a local bookstore. Books classified in such a way are notoriously cursory; I suppose I got what I asked for. If you're a person who prefers a thought-provoking summer novel (like me) for prolonged interest and/or inspiration, you might want to think twice before paying the money for the hardcover edition. The characters, although easy to sympathize with, are cliche to the point of ridicule. Everyone reacts in such a way that is entirely predictable. Nevertheless, Sebold's depiction of heaven is enthralling, especially the description of various smells. Don't be misled by my criticism; this isn't a bad book if you can stand relatively superficial, typical characterization and plot development."
1,Emotional pornography,"Sebold demonstrates a stunning capacity to combine all the worst aspects of American culture into a single novel - materialism, cheap religion, shallow psychotherapy, and a vigilante obsession with rare and violent crimes. The literary conceit is that 14-year-old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered, at which point she enters the perfect consumer heaven - untroubled by God or the unfathomable soul, in Sebold's heaven, we must merely say what we want and it appears. From this vantage, Susie exhibits a mind-boggling lack of curiosity about her sudden new ability to spy on her earthbound loved ones, opting instead to relate the cloyingly transparent activities of her family as they grieve her death and hunt down the man they know killed her, even though they have no evidence to suspect him. From the moment Sebold describes a character's smile as ""like stars exploding,"" I knew this would be a monumental work of emotional [...]."
4,Love it but wished the ending was different,"It's nice to know I'm not the only one who doesn't think Heaven is all angels and harps, but it's ""MY"" Heaven and what you make it.I loved this book, but wish the ending was different. Not all crimes are solved, but this would have been much better if Susie's remains were found in the sink hole and the murder solved. Other than that, it's a 5 star read.Still, I recommend reading this book. I read the entire book in about 6 hours over the period of 2 days."
2,Not worth the hype...,"After all the focus from the press and hype I've heard about this book, I decided to give it a try. It was one of my poorest choices of the year, and wished my $20 was spent elsewhere.I was, frankly, attracted to the book by its first few pages (that was what lured me to purchase it). The story flowed nicely for the first chapter or so, before it began to repeat itself. Motions and dialogues repeat, relationships amazingly odd (especially that of Ruth and Ray...would a childhood crush last a lifetime for those who still have to live their lives?), but most of all-- no plot, no climax, no nothing.I don't know what I have went through after reading the entire book. This is one of the few books that I could put down after reading for every 2 minutes.To be fair, it was creative, and the language has a nice flow to it. But it cannot be said as good fiction."
3,The Not So Lovely Bones,"I picked this book up because I'd heard a lot of glowing reviews from friends. However, I wasn't very impressed. I think the story could have ended about 100 pages before it actually did. The first half is engaging, thought it lags at points. But from pg. 140 and on, it just goes downhill.At first glance, the characters seem real and well put together. But as one reads on, it becomes apparent that Sebold is struggling to develop them further and instead of giving more insight into who these people are, the reader is left with more questions. The plot goes from enchanting and original to cheesy and very Hollywood, so much so, that you might find that you're actually laughing when you are supposed to be crying.But this book did give me hope. Since I'm an aspiring writer myself, I took great comfort in knowing that THIS made it to the best seller list. If Sebold can do it, then there's no question in my mind that I can."
3,It Could Have Been Better,"Alice Sebold is a fantastic writer. Her prose flows from chapter to chapter. But the storyline becomes a bit farfetched and strays over the final 75 pages. Somehow, I sense that this novel will turn into a Steven Spielberg movie. And that's not a compliment."
3,Just Okay.,"I read the book, it was a little painful to finish, because it wasn't going anywhere for me. I expected a different ending and it was ordinary. The book was well written, it came from an unusual point of view and it was an interesting story line, but I didn't find the ""special"" something that it had to make it a bestseller on all the lists. Susie Salmon was a real 14 year old girl that was experiencing life through the eyes of the world she left behind. It is not a mystery if that is what you are looking for, but it is a good rainy day book for the weekend. Enjoy."
3,not what I expected,"When I read the description of this book and the ratings of it for number 1 on the best seller list I thought it would be a great book. It was very disappointing. I kept reading it to find out what everyone was raving about and to see if it improved. When I finished the book my impression was ""what did people see it this."" I am a trauma therapist working a great deal with abuse victims and families and this book could have gone in such better directions. My impression is word of mouth about it being #1 is what keeps people buying it not word of mouth after the read."
4,I like this book,"I think I really like this book. I might not have understood all of it, but I appreciated all that I could. I was unsure about the ending--something about it was unrealistic. Maybe it was the mother suddenly coming back or Mr. Harvey getting killed by an icicle or maybe it was how quickly the family healed. However, there was much to think about in this book, and I'll certainly read it again."
2,Didn't believe in the narrator,"I had a hard time believing this was actually a 14-year-old girl narrating - she felt like an adult to me. Better books with (believable) teenage narrators: Feeling Sorry for Celia, Shadow Baby, An Egg on Three Sticks."
4,Easy to Read. Hard to Forget,"Having also come from a small town where a murder of a teenage girl took place, I felt as if I was taking a front seat in this journey created by Sebold. It starts off gut wrenching, and yet I could barely put it down. You'll watch your children more closely after reading this novel, but don't think it is just about death and the evil mind of the killer, but about love and family and the delicate fabric of time that holds us either in this earthly plane or in Sebold's ""Inbetween."" I hope you enjoy your life too."
3,Touching tale of lossand healing...with a little incoherency,"The Lovely Bones is a beautifully written story full of compassion, feeling of loss, frustration and despair due to loss, and finally healing. There were actually a couple of parts in the story, where I was in tears. In the midst of the sorrow, the author has managed some subtle humour, so the book doesn't leave you feeling stabbed in the stomach. So, basically I recommend this book for everyone. However, there are some things that bothered me, but I clearly blame it on the fact that this is the author's first book...things like - the voice of the 14year old is too mature and understanding for a 14year old..which is not what her character was actually like when she was alive. Also, things like entering a person's body, etc., steals some of the book's credibility. But despite of this I believe the author has true potential, and I hope she writes more. Three stars!"
1,A ....,"What's stunning about this book is the PR and the blindness of most critics who have been doing cartwheels. There is no way at all that this is a convincing voice of a 14-year-old girl. It's too smart, too subtle, too mature, too sophisticated. I could not suspend, no, *crush*, disbelief long enough to enjoy it, and found myself insulted by the author, editor, publisher and reviewers who have put one over on the reading public, which has, sheep-like, made this book a wild success. The book is in its own way as bad as some early Michael Cunningham (A Home at the End of the World) where he has children observing life with the exact same richness of perception as adults. A Reader's Manifesto is absolutely right--reviewers are snowed nowadays by beautiful sentences no matter how opaque, or in this case, how unlikely they are."
4,The Lovely Bones,"I usually don't read novels, especially first novels, but I decided to read The Lovely Bones after glancing online at the first chapter. I was not disappointed. While it is not without flaw, it is an interesting, moving story written by an author who knows grammar, sentence structure, and who has a unique style. The plot engages the reader almost immediately; and the reader is not wont to be disappointed with the subtle suspense that is carried forward to the end of the poignant tale. You're missing a real treat if you pass by this one."
5,connecting,"I'm not even finished reading this book and I love it! Because it's told through the eyes of Susie from heaven, it's as heart- wrenching as it is insightful. Anyone who's lost a loved one, be it a person or a beloved pet, can relate to what Susie's family and friends are going through, as well as see through their own lost loved one's eyes. This book takes you through all possible emotions- sadness, anger, nostalgia- and back again, without missing a beat!"
4,Memorable and haunting,"Sebold's novel is one of the better ones I've read recently, along with Berg's True to form and The Secret LIfe of Bees (don't remember author's name! sorry!). Recommended, particularly with the other two novels, for book groups. I hope Sebold has more stories to tell. Its only flaw is perhaps the deus ex machina handling of the neighbor, but Sebold's metaphor of bones is more important, and so I overlook that."
3,Quality of the book,When I requested the book it said the book was in excellent condition but it was more like fair condition. The cover was riped and had a couple of coffee stains on the cover. Other then that the book was in good condition.
1,Life after death?,"The premise of this book is appalling! A heinous crime is somehow made palatable by giving a murdered girl a ""life"" after her death. I read about the first 50 or so pages before deciding this book was deeply disturbing. It is made more so due to its popularity. What is wrong with people's analytical abilities? I guess it belongs to the same category of books as The Virgin Suicides. Disturbing and disgusting! Lets celebrate life and goodness where it exists, not death! Yuck!"
1,Ridiculous book,"I think Sebold's central message is: if you get raped, go ahead and rape someone else, and continue the circle of horror. Nope, nothing irresponsible about that! That's your book report for the day!"
2,Missing Book Cover,"I was planning on giving this book as a gift, but when it came without a book cover, I was very disappointed. The book obviously looked used, even though there weren't any marks on the inside. The description did not indicate that the book would be coming without a cover, and when it did, I had to change my plans."
2,theres nothing lovely about this book,"This books starts out heartwarming, then horrifying and then sad, then it becomes downright stupid. it explains none of it acid trip logic.it more than deflated, it crashed and burned.I ve never hated a book so much in my life."
3,So-So,"My husband bought this book for my birthday, and with all the hype I was excited to get into it. The book, in essence reminded me of Alice Walker's 'By the Light of my Father's Smile.' Beautiful prose I suppose but I became drained and perhaps even bored by the dreamy overdramatization. Three stars because Sebold provided an excellent depiction of a family displaced and trying to cope and thrive in the face of a tragedy."
2,What's all the hype about?,"This book missed the point somewhere along the way. There was so much potential to this story. However, it just made it to mediocre. There is too much filler and incidental information written. It would have been so much more exciting to be quick and to the point and to keep those characters moving in more compelling ways. It starts off just fine..and then becomes too boring. A great disappointment. DLD"
3,Oprah wannabe,"If Oprah were still doing her BookClub on a regular basis, this would be a shoe-in (Halo-in?) for a monthly pick. It's got the same dysfunctional family & sentimentality going on. If you liked Oprah's picks, this book's for you! Bravo, Jonathan Franzen!"
2,Lucky was Better!,"After reading Alice Sebold's memoir, Lucky, I rushed out to pick up her first novel. I had read how she had started writing this book and was forced to stop and write Lucky first so she could move past her own experiences with rape and focus on Susie Salmon.I was disappointed. Sebold's style in Lucky is raw and real but her style in Lovely Bones seems contrived and capricious. Although I connected well with Susie, the other characters in the story were flat and uninteresting. I would highly recommend Lucky as an alternative Sebold pick for all those who felt let down by this bestseller (and for those who loved it!). It is an incredible account of a serious crime with lots of dark humor but minus the murder and syrupy sweetness of Lovely Bones."
2,Overhyped!,"I agree that this 'novel' is completely overhyped (which is exactly the reason I winded up with it in the first place). I never got past Chapter 7 or so -- with not even a clue nor desire to know how it ended. I just can't understand why it keeps popping up in articles, magazines and the like. It just seems to me that any work of literature that is lucky enough to get the right media attention can magically appear to be a work of art. Not so in this case; I'm befuddled."
3,Missed opportunities,"What a great book this could have been! Great premise, great beginning.I started reading The Lovely Bones prepared to love it. It came highly recommended. Unfortunately it opened up important themes: what motivates serial sexual predators, and how a family copes with the aftermath of such an event and did little with it. For example: the dead protagonist - How did she feel understanding the torment her torturer had once endured himself? Did she ever feel she wanted some kind of justice beyond an earthly one? Did she ever feel torn between the immediate earthly concerns she had while continuing to monitor the lives of her family and friends and the presumably more enlightened view she would have obtained after death. And what of her family, had they ever tried to deal with the aftermath of her death, their failure to come together would have been more compelling. This book took on the big issues, but then took the shallow road out. Too bad, it could have been great!"
2,A sketchbook rather than a painting,"Unsatisfying and manipulative. Learning this was a debut effort explains a lot.I didn't feel the narrative voice was convincingly close enough to a 14 year old's and I suppose the omniscient parts about what her mother/father/siblings/friends are feeling can be ascribed to the heaven vantage point.I found myself asking ""what was the author intending?"" more than I should, especially considering with a really compelling story, one forgets about the writer's existence entirely. The plot seemed to be advanced mainly through a desire for justice rather than interest in individual characters and the ending was just too Touched by Angel for my taste.There are so many better authors who can show rather than tell.I wonder if this book is so popular because of the subject matter, and to find fault with it is somehow an indictment of personal grief?"
2,A Let Down,"Everyone was gushing about this book so I read it to see what the fuss was about. i have to say the idea of a murdered girl narrating from her own desired idea of heaven is an interesting one, however there are major frustrations when we read about those left on earth. Susie's sister Lindsey seems to mature far faster than is normal (losing her virginity at 14?). Also Mr. Harvey ""gets away with it"". Though he ends up dying in a freak accident, nobody in Susie's family knows. We're left with no closure at all."
2,Not Very Convincing -- or Satisfying...,"I didn't know what to expect but, while I found ""The Lovely Bones"" just (barely) engaging enough to finish the book, I kept hoping for more and the last part of the book was especially disappointing. It isn't a challenging piece of work and, while it may be a ""...page-turner..."" for some, it definitely is not ""...in the vein of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'..."" (as described on the back of the jacket)."
3,??? - who knows - ???,"Ok. I finished the book, but I was definitely expecting a lot more. The beginning of the novel was extremely gloomy, but I found myself becoming bored as I read further. I never put a book down, but I had to with this one. Once, I picked it up again, it was bit more interesting.Although the middle of the book was a bit dull, the ending made up for it. I rate this book a 3 for the middle, definitely not the beginning or end.As for the characters, the conflicts were resolved which made this an interesting read. The conclusion was interesting, but I wonder - how realistic?If you like death and afterlife - buy the book. If not - don't waste your time."
4,amazing,"I thought this book was fantastic! I was completely immersed in Susie's (after) life, and whipped through this book in two days. A part of me was sad that it was over. I recommended it to everyone I know, and have a waiting list for people wanting to borrow my copy. The description of Heaven being a place made especially for you, with familiar sights, sounds, and even smells was an idea that provoked an immense feeling of peace within me. Fabulous!"
4,The Lovely Bones,"The Lovely Bones is a chilling novel that grabs you in the second sentence; "" I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973."" Susie is on her way home from school when she decided to take a shortcut through a cornfield. Soon enough she is lured into a hideaway built by a neighbor, where she becomes his next victim. Susie is brutally raped and murdered. Sebold shows her talent by describing the crime in a manner where the reader is chilled but not disgusted. The novel is narrated by Susie from heaven, where wishing is having. This first person narration gives a warm connection between her and the reader. She looks down on hearth watching as her friends and family deal with the grief of her absence. Her distort father hides his sadness as he tries to find evidence. Looking down, Susie so badly wants to give them the answers, lead them to her body. The Community really comes together, everyone quietly helps investigate the murder."
3,"Not great, but good.","Likely I would have given this book a higher rating had I first read Alice Sebold's true memoir, entitled Lucky. It would have helped me to understand the depth of emotion with which The Lovely Bones was written. Perhaps The Lovely Bones only failed to be a ""great"" book in my mind because its press had prepared me for something incredible. It wasn't. Alice Sebold's writing style was appealing enough to give her the second chance, though, and I was pleased enough to have read both. I'll remember her other book for much longer."
4,Interesting Read,"The Lovely Bones weaves a beautiful story from a sad concept. Told from the point of view of a dead teenage girl who now resides in heaven, we meet many characters who have affected her (and she has affected) throughout life and death.It's worthwhile to spend some time on this novel. Although I didn't see it as a page-turner, I did not struggle to finish it. The whole story was completely satisfying. Alice Sebold does not disappoint, and who hasn't wondered what heaven is like? The Lovely Bones paints an interesting theory."
2,too much hype,"At first i was excited to read this book having heard and read so much about it but it turned out to be disappointing particularly the character of Susie Salmon's mother, Abigail. The author never made clear her emotions and why she left her family ro dift off in some far away places only to come back when her husband had a heart attack. I thought the author made a very superficial character, weak and undeveloped. All in all this book is a big disappointmnet and it reads more like a third grade novel than a literary achievment it was hyped to be."

All in all this book is a big disappointmnet and it reads more like a third grade novel than a literary achievement it was hyped to be."
3,Quite Good,"Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones, her debut, celebrates Grace in form of a tragedy. The author starts you off from a very unfortunate loss which initially brought Susie's family to turmoil and eventual redemption to hope and grace; even for Susie herself. The book may have more room for some more pages of character and plot development. But altogether, the book is a moving experience. It is indeed an affirmation of the idea that life goes on. Except this one leaves a comfortable smile of promise in your heart."
4,Astonisingly wonderful,"This book took me by surprise. Recommended by a friend, I sat down not expecting to feel such compassion and hate for both people and for life. This book is beautifuly written and at times the harsh reality of the story is hard to handle, but it is so worth the journey it takes you through, I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends and family.Read the excerpt to get an idea what you're in for, because I find it hard to do this wonderful piece justice."
4,This would be an Oprah book club pick...,"...if she still had a book club. It has all the signatures of the books she chose, most of which I did enjoy, though I did come to understand that in picking up an Oprah book club selection, I was signing up for a particular kind of story--young female protagonist, heartbreaking violation of a childhood, ultimate triumph. This book did call me back to it whenever I put it down, and the first two thirds move quickly and compellingly. The last third, for me, meandered, and I began to feel impatient for the author to wrap things up. Don't want to give away the plot, so I can't really get in to my frustration with the final third, but overall, a beautifully written and hopeful view of our ability to survive the worst that can be leveled at us. Worth reading, I think, despite the flaws."
4,Unresolved,"I read this book about a year ago. It was a rather beautiful story about a young girl that gets murdered and how the family copes with, first, her disappearance, and then her murder investigation. All throughout the book the young girl looks down at the life of her family from her heaven. I think this book was well written and offered the reader a fresh and different perspective of heaven than I had ever heard of. It was easy for me to get into the story, and I even to related to the characters well. However, at the end of this book I was slightly disappointed. I felt like something was left unresolved in the story. Nonetheless, that doesn't stop me from considering this a very good book."
4,Pearls of wisdom,"I really loved the book and give it 4 stars only because of some character flaws that made me feel a little empty at the end (especially Susie's mom). Alice Sebold said some beautiful things about death and how the dead hold unto you until their through with you. I liked that and won't forget it. She also gave me insight into the mind of the serial killer when she said he had ""wild and bottomless lust."" In many ways she writes like Joyce Carol Oates. Very observant and deep. I will remember Susie and the horrible Mr. Harvey for quite a while."
2,Amateurish writing camouflaged in a teenager's voice,"Intriguing plot but not particularly original. The voice may sound authentic in the beginning. But as the mystery unfolds, it's obviously that the writer was camouflaging her lack of style and transition in the narrative of a teenager."
5,Great Book - held interest all through,"Zipped right through this. Couldn't wait for the outcome and if the killer would be found. I could feel the feelings of the victim.and yes to Tim Datasmith the author was really raped read ""Lucky"" by same author"
5,Lovely Bones is lovely book,"As a 14 year old girl living in suburbia, I could relate to the main character very closely, right down to the fact that we share a passion for photography and have a somewhat estranged family. Alice Sebold is such an amazing author and tells this story from such an interesting viewpoint, up above in heaven.Filled with love & hope, and yet despair & sympathy this book will blow you off your feet. I COULD NOT put it donw until it was finished, and then I wanted more."
1,HUH?,"Okay, this is going to be quick review because I am still amazed to find this book on the New York Times Best Seller list. I read it. I closed it up and returned it to the library. Like other reviewers, I don't understand why it's been so popular. It's an okay book. Nothing great and certainly nothing that will live for years. Of course a review is simply one person's opinion and that's mine. Whether this helps you or not, I don't particularly care. Just had to speak my mind after all these months! :o)"
1,Look out for this turkey!,"1 star-for marketing, 0 stars- for writing. What starts off with a decent hook and a rather clever idea of heaven, quickly decends into a morass of syrupy narrative, unbeliveably trite dialogue and cardboard characters. Many, many plot holes and an annoying tendency for the characters to make leaps to correct and crucial decisions out of nowhere. I could see this book marketed as a light read for the teenagers, mostly female, but certainly not to any reader looking for a book that is ""destined to become a classic.""Here is a small sample of the writing that set my teeth on edge:""She pulled Len in to her and slowly kissed him on the mouth. He seemed to hesitate at first. His body tensed, telling him NO, but that NO became vague and cloudy, became air sucked into the intake fan of the humming hydrant beside them. She reached up and unbuttoned her raincoat. He placed his hand against the thin gauzy material of her summer gown."" (pg. 148)WHEW!!"
2,Really??,"Maybe it was the hype that killed it for me, but I tried THREE times to read this book. Long before the movie tie-in. I also gave it out as gifts to a few people, including my mom and none of us actually finished it.I loved the premise, which is why I bought so many copies. Hardback copies at that. :( But the execution really didn't work for me. I wanted to like it, but no dice.I'm not sure what all of these 5-star reviews are about. I guess art really IS amazingly subjective."
1,Total Headache.,"I really wanted to like this book. It literally gave me a headache trying to read through it. The author tried to cram about 6 thoughts into one broken up sentence. You have to reread the sentence a few times to even understand what she was trying to say, then you realize it has no significance. Guhh. It was almost like listening to a drunk person ramble on. Or talking to a child with severe ADD. It was so unorganized.Don't waste your time."
1,I gave it a one star because I couldn't get any lower.,"I read this book in it's regular paperback form because it was given to me by my Son for Christmas this year. I finished the book for the same reason. I found the book to wander along, jump around and be hard to follow. The character of Susie was too laid back to believe. The descriptions of the different ""heavens"" began well and then would dissolve leaving the reader wondering if the writer fell asleep during that part of production. The sentiment behind the book is there, though veiled thru the many, many, many characters and their comings and goings. This is the first time that I have ever hoped that the movie is nothing like the book."
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"This book is by far my least favorite. While I'll agree that the author has talent, hence the three stars, I never felt drawn in, and while the story for obvious reasons is not a ""happy"" one, I missed the emotional connection that I often crave when reading a book of this magnitude. My heart just wasn't in it, no tears were spilled unfortunately. Plot spoiler: The fact that the murderer died mercifully left me with unresolved issues. Additionally, my vision of Heaven is so peacefully euphoric that I was deeply disappointed by its design in this book. The idea that anyone would have to watch their family mourn them and then subsequently fall apart seems more like Hell in my eyes. This is not a book I'd recommend, however, it's obvious by all the amazing reviews and Hollywood's desire to put its hands on it that I'm a rarity."
4,"Good beginning and middle, kind of weird ending...","I really enjoyed this book, but somewhere towards the ending of the story, the plot took a weird turn. I don't want to give away the ending because I still think this book is worth reading. But I finished the book feeling somewhat unsatisfied."
5,Good book,Bought this for my wife. She said it was a good read. Kinda sad though. Good read if you're going to watch the movie. Read this first.
3,Engaging Mind Warp,"Engaging fantasy where everybody gets their own heaven, even apparently pedophile serial murderers. Yeah, right!"
2,"1st half great, 2nd half BAD - so forget it.","Well, what can I say? I enjoyed the first half of this book, but hated the second half. The 1st half was interesting, and almost believable. It doesn't have to be exactly factual - it just has to be believable. But the second half was slow, slow, slow... and the ending?? Well, I won't give it away, but it felt like I was reading a supernatural mills & boon!! It was TERRIBLE!! Completely unbelievable, ridiculous, and wrapped up in too neat a little package for me at the end. Two stars for the 1st half, but nothing for the second. Don't waste your time or your money, or you'll literally be rolling your eyes at the end just like I was."
1,Disappointing,"Halfway through I realized the only reason I was continuing to read was to discover what happens to Mr. Harvey, the murderer. So I flipped over to the ending, scanned it and put the book away.The prose was lovely if a little tiring at times, and too many scenes were unbelieveable and even disturbing. A girl in heaven watching her mother's adultery? A camp counselor assigning the theme ""how to commit a perfect murder"" as a project (in theory, mind you) for junior high kids? A mother, already having had one child murdered, leaves her small boy in a mall play area to meet with her lover?I had treated myself to a stack of books for my birthday -- wish I had my money back for this one."
3,I don't get it,"I got this book because I had heard such good reviews I couldn't wait to read it. Boy was I disappointed! When you read a book dealing with the death of a child you expect to read it with a box of kleenex in tow, but the character development was so poor I found myself not caring about any of the characters. You never get into the heads of any of them. The first 50 pages were a very fast read but then it goes on for another 250 where nothing much happens and the killer never gets caught. I had a hard time finishing it. It was an ok read but not anything I would recommend that's for sure."
4,Lovely!,im a very slow reader. but i finished this book in less then two weeks. it is one you will have a hard time putting down! some parts were a little slow but over all one of the best books i have ever read.
5,simply amazimg,"Such a well-written, heartwarming story. Great for all ages. Extremely well done narrative. Just read it on my new kindle! Makes the experience even better. Would read a hundred times more."
3,Sad and Longing,"This is a sad but riveting book. Read it and experience the frustration of knowing what to do with whom, but unable to do it. The characters in this book take out their misery in different and sometimes miserable ways. But...who knows how one would handle tragedy until one experiences it. There are far more terrible monsters in this would than depicted in the movies, and we meet one in this book.Virgil Howarth"
5,Can't wait for the movie,Loved this book - it was very well written and thought provoking. I like how we got to know each of the characters and came to appreciate their flaws. They were all just trying to deal with a very difficult situation in their own way and the journey made for a great read.
4,A worthy reading selection,"I originally heard about this book from a former student of mine who mentioned it was a good book, but also easy to pick up and begin reading. Also, I knew the motion picture was coming out soon and I like many other readers enjoy reading a book prior to viewing the movie version.I was instantly hooked after reading the sample chapters for this book which is surprising for me because I generally put my leisure reading off, but I couldn't do that to do this book. I really loved chapter to chapter and although some were more like ""filler"" chapters most were entertaining.It's a bookworthy selection for most age groups and those who are still intrigued and bothered by child killers & their victims & their family. So, download it--you won't be disappointed!"
3,"First half good, then got disappointing","I really thought this book had a lot of potential. The first half was very good and I really wanted more. I was disappointed in the ending and didn't feel that Mr. Harvey really got what he deserved. I wanted to see the family get some real peace and catch the bastard.I think if the book would have continued more as a murder/mystery it would have been good. I know it ended up being more about the family and I get that, but I wanted more of the mystery.It was still well written and I did enjoy it. I just felt let down by the ending and really expected an entirely different story."
2,I Thought it Would be Better,"I suppose I entered into reading this book with high expectations. After all, it was all over the TV and media as a wonderful and unique novel. At first, during the description of the murder and its immediate after effects, I was very intrigued. But towards the middle of the book, I began to feel let down. This is it??? The end of the book had a very unrealistic flare that made it seem ""written to be made into a movie."" Too bad. It had potential. Also, if you pick it up thinking it will give an entirely new and wonderful idea of what heaven is....then, you may be disappointed. Nothing really enlightening to me."
3,A different approach,"Expectations sometimes work against a book, and that probably was the case with me.This book is written from the viewpoint of a murdered girl, Susie Salmon. And, her viewpoint is sad and touching, violent and scary, and funny and wistful. I found her part, very engrossing.But, I thought Ms. Seybold resorted to stereotypes, and things we've seen and read before, for the rest of the characters. The father's anger and behavior is understandable, but expected. And, what does the grieving wife and mother do? The same here, as in many of those other sad and meaningful? books. Then there is the wise grandmother, the weird friends.And Susie returns to earth, to do what? She was 14 years old when she was murdered.Finally, the ending wasn't one I would hope for. Too neat and quick a resolution, for me."
3,Thought-provoking...,"What do I really think Heaven is like? This is the question I have been asking myself since reading The Lovely Bones, narrated by Susie Salmon, a murdered teenage girl residing in her own version of Heaven.Susie lives in a perfect place surrounded by coveted objects from her most vivid imaginings, yet she is still aware of and emotionally involved in the lives of the friends and family she left behind. She is omni-present and is able to facilitate the unfolding plot from a ubiquitous perspective.Her loved ones' lives are shattered as a result of her death, and, try as she might, she can do nothing to intercede. She is left to see the harsh unraveling that she incidentally caused.The Lovely Bones is a thought-provoking effort from a first-time author; however, I feel the resolution of the story (without giving it away) is too forced and inconsistent with the rest of the novel. Overall, though, this book left me asking myself some great questions, which makes it worth the read."
4,"A Lovely, Lovely Read!","While Sebold's debut novel may not pack the literary punch of an Austen or a Bronte, The Lovely Bones' haunting, ethereal prose lingers long after the novel's conclusion. Sebold's narrator, Susie Salmon, pushes the reader forward through the entire novel by grabbing an immediate interest in her life (after-life?) from the very first paragraph ... Discover this wonderful novel!"
5,Read it and cheer!,"I bought this book based on Anna Quindlan's Today Show review, ""If you read no other book this summer, this is the book you should read."" She was right, right, right! Alice Sebold is a first-class story teller - who captures the spirit of a 14-year-old girl perfectly. I look forward to future novels from this talented writer."
3,Watch the Hype!,"Like other reviewers, I felt almost guilty for not liking the book better. I read about the touching, ""luminous"" writing. If ""luminous"" means ""I can't figure out what the hell this sentence is saying,"" then luminous the book is.The concept was excellent - girl in heaven looking after her friends & family after her murder. Susie was fairly fleshed out, and her dad was real, but, again like other reviewers, I found most of the characters rather stilted and unreal.Still and all, I found myself turning pages until the last 3 or 4 chapters where it was a matter of, sorry, getting the damn thing over with!"
4,Great for a first novel ...,I read a wide variety of authors and genres. I was surprised at how engaged I was in this book. It is a great idea and one that I have not come across before in terms of story telling. The story itself will rip your heart out if you are a parent of a young girl. This is not on my top ten all time favorites but I frequently recommend it to people who like to read and are looking for something more original than what you'll find on the NYTimes best seller list.
5,Amazing Book,"This book was so great, I would recommend it to anyone. I wasn't sure at first if I wanted to read it, but after I read her other book ""Lucky"", I knew that I had to buy it.If any of you ladies need a good read over the holidays, read ""The Lovely Bones""."
3,Emotional,"Your emotions can't help but be stirred by this book. The storyline is an excellent idea as disturbing as it may be to any parent.As good as this book is, you can't help thinking it could have been so much better. Somewhere along the line it seems as though the writer just gets tired of writing and wants to wrap things up. There are also times it could have been more suspenseful, but the opportunity is allowed to pass.It's still worth the read."
4,Wonderful beginning...excellent story,"The first several chapters of this book are touching, heartbreaking, and also hilarious. Susie's intitial descriptions of ""her heaven"" are spiced with a 14 year-old's imagination and cynicism. However, the story gradually loses some of it's opening orginality and freshness. Still a great read."
3,A pretty good read.,I have to agree that this in not the best book ever but it is a good read. The writer could have done a better job with the story line. Some parts of the story are filled with fluff that I scanned over to get on with the story. The ending of the book was disappointing and could have been better. The characters could have been developed more. All in all I did enjoy the book though. I'd love to see Alice Sebold rewrite some of the story.
5,Entrapped Love,"I really enjoyed reading Lovely Bones. Seabold beautifully and romantically transcended her character's need and desire to love by skillfully describing acts of rape, having visions of the deceased, longing to live again, not just on the main character's part, and many other explicitly decribed weavings of suspense and activity. Lovely Bones was truly a remarkable novel written with grace and sensitivity.I would recommend this book to individuals who long to be engrossed and compelled to finish a novel about the various sins committed in each of the character&#65533;s attempt to achieve unconditional love."
1,Not My Kind Of Book,"...The first chapter sets up the reader for some major disappointment. Susie is telling us about her murder and yet there is no emotion for her or the reader. It seems that she is just an observer in her own death and not even a horrorified observer. The lack of emotion and important details continues throughout the whole book. The murderer isn't even that interesting! For a story about a murdered girl, there is a lot of fluffy tales of the happenings on earth(Starting after chapter 1 and going to the end of the book), such as a sister's romance and a budding friendship between 2 classmates. There are many tales of sex as well, which seems completely unnecessary. Overall I gave this book 1 star because I was upset that the hype got to me and my book club.For every 1 star there is a 5 star... so this is just 1 opinion for which there are millions more to choose from."
3,Hauntingly Inconsistent,"Disturbing, sad, and beautifully written, THE LOVELY BONES is as inconsistent as the sentence I just wrote. Alice Sebold's moving account of a 14-year-old girl's metaphysical oddysey following her brutal murder evokes more questions than answers.The protagonist, Susie Salmon, gives us a first-person account of her death, her experience in Heaven, and the lingering effect of her death on her family with a detached aloofness that often suspends credibility. How...how on earth...can this tragic character relate the events of the story with such emotional sterility? It's as if another person were killed, and Susie is giving us the grisly aftermath as an objective reporter. Her transcendental afterlife, as she moves freely between Heaven and earth, rings hollow, almost purgatorial: there is an inconsistent lack of an emotional investment.That said, Alice Sebold provides a haunting, well-written narrative. Good, but less than satisfying."
1,The Lovely Bones,"Now I have read the worst book of my entire life. This book had no redeeming values what-so-ever! Believe me, it is a waste of time. The characters were shallow, and you really could care less what happens to them. The story didn't flow right, and was all over the place. She would introduce characters (Ruth) and then you never knew or cared what happened to her. And her idea of Heaven, for gosh sakes, Woman, read the Bible! Who wants to live a life for God only to end up in a place like what she describes Heaven to be! Please don't waste your time like I did, and pick a better book for Book Club. Life is full of enough despair without adding more to it."
1,The Lovely Bones,"I ordered this book along with ""Lucky"" by the same seller. I never received it. I wrote to inform the seller and Amazon. I was credited the amount of purchase. I have since reordered it and waiting for it to arrive."
1,I don't get it,"I cannot believe the hype this book has received. Utterly boring and unreadable. Undoubtedly one must be religious to enjoy this silly, seemingly un-ending piece of supernatural tripe. America is not so different from its Muslim counterparts in embracing all this other-worldliness - whether ""heaven"" or ""martyrism"" with 72 virgins - it's all the same ridiculous superstition. May reason someday prevail, and only then will there be a chance of peace amongst nations.Another gripe - soooo PC. The dark-skinned Indians were so much more beautiful than the whites - plus she could bake the vastly better pie. Ray was angelic. His mother was superior in all ways. When will silly white writers stop genuflecting to the darker-colored? A look at racial crime might be in order. As in 99% of inter-racial crime is black/hispanic on white. Do your research you silly white liberals! Research crime stats! You then just might - maybe - find that the victims in this nation are white, not black."
1,Sooo disappointed....,"I expected so much and got soooo little from this book. It started out okay but through the book it became slow and drawn out. The characters were not developed enough for me. The story jumped around between past reflections, different characters, and did not seem to have a clear or finished thought. (if that makes sense) I am glad this only cost me less than 10 bucks. There were only a few good moments in the book that had you wanting to keep reading but they were not enough to hold your attention. Not the best book in my opinion."
3,Great until the end,"I loved this book and was excited for the possibilities. However, at some point near the end, it became completely unreal and that ruined it for me. It also seemed like the end just wrapped up in a hurry as if the author suddenly had a deadline to meet.I was really disappointed in this book which is a shame because I loved it so much in the beginning."
5,Amazingly well written with beautiful descriptions,"This book was wonderfully written. Sebold does a fantastic job of blurring the lines between life in heaven and life on earth. She takes us through the journey of Susie's murder, and we watch Susie in heaven as she herself watches her family on earth. This story was not just about the family letting go of Susie, but of her letting go of her family and her lifelong dreams."
4,Very Interesting Read,I enjoyed this book very much! I bought it in the airport and was almost done by the time my plane landed 4 hours later. I couldn't put it down. Presents a very interesting perspective on the afterlife. Highly recommend.
2,how is this such a good seller?!,"i didn't enjoy this book! parts were disturbing... and boring. i didn't even think it was worth finishing, so i stopped. other people i know who read it said it was depressing and not very good. i have no idea what the hype was about!"
2,Bizarre,"This book got great reviews so I was quite excited to read it. As I read I felt that it was at best good, but as I neared the end I couldn't believe the bizarre turns the book took and I found myself skimming paragraphs. Had certain parts of the book (e.g. most of the afterlife) been omitted and the characters been developed better this book could have been very good. I'm truly surprised that many people could have enjoyed it that much."
4,Wonderful and Original!,"Lovely Bones was such a great book, unlike other I have ever read. It is full of intelligence and thought and you really have to admire the author for putting that much thought into it! It was really interesting to read about death from another person's perspective and then to also get the perspective of the characters in the book! My only complaint is that some concepts in the book were not explained enough, such as the whole idea of Susie ""breaking through"" for the first time, and the concept of accepting her death and moving to another level in heaven. It was a complex thought process by the author, but maybe after a few more reads it will become more clear! I really recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a thought provoking and orignial read. Guaranteed, it will be different than anything else you have read recently."
4,A Different Perspective,"First of all, the narrator is the dead Susie Salmon. She was killed. From the heaven above, she supposedly tells the story while watching her family and close friends on earth. Reminds me of the movie 6th Sense. OK don't read it if you couldn't bear that idea.This is exactly what makes the book interesting. She could see everything, things seem to be so close, but she couldn't do anything. Helpless. As the story unfolds in a remarkably descriptive way, the suspense continues. My heart reaches for those girls with similar fate, and especially the families. I wish the truth would be disclosed and everybody gets what (s)he deserves. A closure.But no, this is a different story. What we want is not exactly what we need."
4,Haunting,"This is the story of a terrible tragedy. Susie is raped and murdered by Mr. Harvey. She tells this story from heaven, and through following the implosion and reconstruction of her own family, she finally finds her own peace.Most of the loose ends are tied very neatly in this book, though justice is never really dealt. There are some very spooky supernatural type scenes; anyone who is strictly judeo-christian may be slightly offended by some of the ideas here.But for the most part, it is a story that will simply strike at your heart and break it. For it can't have a happy ending. Susie is dead, and there's no fixing that.(*)>"
3,She almost had me...,"I'd waited quite a while to get my hands on this one. I borrowed it from a friend and read it in 2 sittings so it's quite a fast read. I loved the beginning and the set up. It's quite exciting to be able to have the omniscient point of view from the start. The device to have the narrator a deceased girl looking down from heaven is really clever. Also, I loved the ideas the author has about heaven.I believe the problem with the book is that it doesn't know what it wants to be... a novel about picking up the pieces after a violent death in the family... or a serial killer story and consequentially, it does neither very well. And then we have the ending... so silly, so incredible, so inappropriate... for me, it ruined the joys of the first part. I would never go as far as saying that it's not worth reading... but after such a great start, I do confess to be very disappointed in the end."
3,What's with that icicle?,"I too got engrossed in the novel, but by the end, I thought it was ridiculous."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"Can anyone truly imagine what life would be like without them in it? What goes on when we are gone, both on earth or in Heaven (or in the realm of death in general)? I found this book truly extraordinary in that it takes a tragic situation and builds a dramatic and sometimes light- hearted story of one girl's experience in answering these questions. It is a must read! I could hardly put it down, and it also left me with some things to ponder. This book stays with you because it focuses on issues that we all will have to eventually face. Beautifully written, too!"
1,Terribly Contrived...,"""Lovely Bones"" seemed more to be a book written to be a bestseller than a book that was written and happened to become one..."
1,phony book,-the premise is a good one-- a book narrated by someone recently passed over -too bad the writer isnt up to the task- this book is contrived and manipulative --- all books manipulate the reader of course-- but brilliant books do it with a certain grace and believablity-- this is a prurient bunch of nonsense- with no real meat to it-- i hated it and couldnt even finish it- dont waste yer time-----
1,A Most Dissappointing Book,"The Lovely Bones had a Lovely Book Cover and that is about it!Seldom am I pulled in by so much hype over a book,but must admit that is why I bought this book.Also, I thought the concept might be interesting. I thought I would never get through this book, but made myself do so.I read the book to the end, as painful as it was for me. I felt it was poorly written, and a waste of time. It held no interest for me whatsoever. There are so many great books to read. The Lovely Bones is not one of them."
1,I fell for they hype,I got the Kindle sample and was not impressed but talked myself out of my hesitation because the book had received so many positive reviews. I should have followed my instincts. Each page was a bigger disappointment and totally unbelievable...a mother who lost a child runs off and abandons her other children is not something a mother would do....a 14 year old girl who is raped and murdered has a chance to come back to experience life and chooses to come back to have sex with a boy she barely knew is not something a rape victim would do. I am really confused as to why so many people enjoyed this book.
2,Very disappointing. Too much going on.,"I've heard of this book, of course, for several years. I finally decided to read it after seeing previews for the movie. The way the book starts is promising. The first few chapters (and last few chapters) held my interest but I kept waiting for something more to happen. Actually, I kept reflecting back to the movie previews which make it seem more like a thriller or intense drama. That's not what the book is like. The book is more about an exploration of the grief process--in about a half a dozen characters. There's just as many subplots in the book which is too many! I think Alice Sebold should have picked 1 or 2 characters and and plots and focused on them. Instead, she tries to do too much and loses the effect she wanted to create. Overall, I think the book is a waste of time. Just my opinion, but I think the movie might be more interesting than the book--how often does that happen?"
3,Ugh depressing!,"To be fair, it was a good book but I would not recommend it to a friend. It started off so good but it just continued to be depressing. I suppose the rape and murder of a 14 year old girl is never a comedic book theme but I was hoping for some sort of story about family coming together after tragedy, which sort of happened, but mainly it was just about grief, grief and more grief. Unless you're into having a good cry and never any laughs, this isn't the book for you."
3,not as good as expected,"I've heard mostly good things about this book, so I decided to read it. The point of view was interesting and unique and the beginning pulled me in. But, about halfway through I was getting bored and the ending was pretty anticlimactic."
5,Hollywood or Not,"I was deeply moved by this book. Suzie is murdered at fourteen by a neighborhood monster. She goes to heaven and watches for years -- and describes in the first person -- how her bereaving family and friends cope with that fact. That the ultimate denouement is a bit too Hollywoody (as some other reviewers have said) doesn't detract, in my opinion, from the grace and the insight about family relationships and about life's miracles with which the author imbues her story. When Hollywood brings out the movie, it may turn out to be quintessentially tacky (but I still hope they do!). But the writing is poignantly beautiful, magically inspired. A definite must-read."
4,Very good effort!,"Susie Salmon tells her story from heaven after being raped an murdered. She describes how her family is coping with the terrible events that unfold from her murder and how life in heaven develops.The book presents a well depicted vision of what heaven is like but the most important acomplishment is the unveiling of what a family goes through as a consequence of such horrible events.The only flaw I can point is that there is a point in which the story moves forward in time very fast creating a gap that would have been better filled with a more thorough depiction of what was going on.Overall a very good read, definitely worth your time!"
4,Good Book,"Good book, definitely worth reading. This books seems almost poetic in a way, i like Alice Sebold's way of writing. Anyway, good book, i would recomend it."
5,Most Emotional Book I've Ever Read,"I can quibble over what I perceive as certain flaws in the book. The male characters are generally bland, some of the key scenes are cut too short, and the waxing poetic goes on a little too long for my tastes in some parts. But as I said, this is quibbling. What was most significant for me was the unbelievable emotions this book stirred and it's going to take me a while to get why that is (I just finished it a couple of hours ago as I write this). Sadness mixed with joy mixed with grief mixed with wonderment - often all together. Alice Sebold is a touching and gifted writer who has created an unbelievably moving experience in this book. It's magical."
2,Not worth the hype,"I found this book disappointing. There was so much hype and it fell short of my expectations. The dialogue was not believable, and there was no closure at the end. It seemed to ramble on forever without the good ending I had expected."
2,Heaven can wait,"This book uses an unusual point of view as a perspective on a horrific event and its aftermath, but in the end, I felt like I was the one being manipulated. I looked forward to finishing this book more than any I've read recently, just so I could move on to something better."
5,The Lovely Bones,"Heavenly......literally. Engaging, human, psychologically very real. By far, best read of the summer."
2,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS......,"Why is it on the NYT bestsellers' list i have no idea, other than a interesting concept of posthumous narrative, there's nothing more to the novel than gratuitous emtional fluff. I can't believe i bought this book. If you are into that kinda stuff, and have nothing better to do, maybe u can consider buying if from me."
4,Good but a bit grisly for me...,"This book has a terrific plot. It is about young Susie Salmon dying and going to heaven. Unfortuantely, she dies on account she was raped and murdered. Aside from that grisly part in the beginning, this book is a good read. The way Sebold gives life to her charcters is great, though the mother seemed a bit unrealistic and too dramatic. If you can stand constant sex scenes and mention of rape, this is a good book to read."
5,The Lovely Bones,The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is the story of a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon who was raped and murdered by a neighbor and family friend. Throughout this story Susie is watching her family and friends from Heaven. She has to watch her family suffer and deal with her loss while at the same time she is trying to move on so that her family will do the same. This is a very unusual book but very well written and it made me want to read it for hours at a time. The author's creative twists really make this book one of a kind and the ending is delightful. Overall this book is very well-done and I would definitely recommend it to anybody.
2,A Little Slow,"I was psyched to read this book because I heard that it was great, but when I actually started reading it, I thought it was boring. It's interesting because it was from Susie's point of view but it was a little slow in places and the flashbacks could have been placed a little better"
2,not worth the hype,"The writer had a wonderfully unique premis but failed to capitalize on it. My book club (10 women) read it and we all thought that it had been over hyped. It wasn't awfull - just not great either. The first chapter is a ""10"" then each one that followes is less until you are realy happy to see it end."
1,Very Dissapointed,I thought this book took a very serious subject and made light of it. I found it very depressing and could not believe the comments on the cover after I finished reading the entire book. There was nothing funny about it and did not find it well written. Was very shocked at the reviews and awards.
2,"Started Out Good, But...","I started out really liking this book and would have actually recommended it. But, then I started reading the last quarter of the book. What a cop out to end the book the way she did. A first grader could have seen it coming...which makes it all the worse in my opinion. The very ending with Mr. Harvey was the worst of it in my opinion. What had been a very well written book turned to a wrap up of the book that was meant to make the reader feel better about what had happened."
2,Depressing!,I thought this book was really depressing. It opens with Susie's murder. She is murdered by her neighbor and the whole focus of the book is how Susie and her family deal with her death. The book is narrated by Susie who watches over her family and friends from heaven. I found the book so depressing because the version that Susie has of heaven is not one that I want to go. Her heaven is everything she ever wanted except for the fact that she can't have her life on earth. That is of course what Susie wants the most. She watches the lives of the people she cared about as they deal with her death and she is impotent to help them through anything.The book would have been better if Susie's body would have been found and there was some sort of closure. The book didn't have a happy ending... you just don't know what is going to happen.
5,A truely lovely book,"It goes without saying that there are people who will not like or even want to read this book. the subject matter is difficult and one knows from the second sentence that there can be no completely happy ending. However, this is absolutely one of the most beautifully crafted books I have ever read. Sebold's prose is simple, powerful and enthralling. It must also be said that this is not a perfect book and there are some aspects of the ending that did not sit well with me. This is definately one of those books that is about the journey not the destination. Susie, Lindsay, Buck and the rest feel like family to me and I will revist them time and again."
5,MASTERPIECE,"Susie Salmon, a 14 year old victim of a serial killer tells her tale from her personal heaven and this is one of the most imaginative tales I ever read. She spends much of her time exploring the nature of heaven, though paradoxically, her true idea of heaven is just to be alive and with her family and friends, be able to grow up and enjoy life. She wants to follow lives of people she knew. This is a tale of horror told without hate or bloody details. On the contrary, it is full of love and humor. Of cause, the narrator, Alyssa Bresnahan deserves the best possible marks. Her performance is outstanding.This is one of these books you cannot put down. You know the end,but you want to get there at a slow pace and make sure that the end is the right one. I think this book is one of the best books written in a long while."
2,Not as good as the hype,"Whoever marketed this book did a great job.........it is my opinion that it is way over hyped, much too highly rated and doesn't deserve the attention it has been getting. As I moved through it I couldn't help but think that I would have taken the story in a different direction. This happened often. I found that much of the book spent too many words on subjects that were of no interest to me, whether fictional or real. I was enthralled for the first two chapters and it was downhill from there and by the end I was really skimming to get it finished, always thinking that any minute it would reach out and grab me. It never did. Can't recommend this one."
1,Make No Bones About It,"Please don't waste your time on this un-original sensationalistic novel. Unless you were enthralled with the OJ trial, it will not interest you. Borrowing special effects from several movies (b-movies), it has nothing uplifting to say about the human condition. I only completed it, because I was expecting something to redeem it. Alas, I was disappointed again. Since it was a best seller, I can only equate the interest to the OJ spectacle....."
5,Unlike anything you've read before,What a wonderful novel to begin a career. This was an absolute pleasure to read and unlike anything I've read before. You can't help but think that all those who have left this earth are watching over from thier own version of heaven.
3,"Not all that and a bag of chips, but an okay story","I finished this book last night and have to say it is worth finishing. But I found it to be by turns both gruesome and sentimental. The grief of Susie's family lingers, but the scenes from her heaven wander into a too sweet sitcom version of a 14-year-old girl's feelings."
2,Trite and cliched,"Unless you're a sentimental middle-aged housewife, don't believe the hype.This book is trite and completely ordinary. The voice is tired, the characters are cliched, the plot sags, and the aftertaste is that of water. I persevered past page 70 -- indeed, I finished the book out of sheer will, trying to see what in the world was so remarkable and moving about it. But it remained utterly bland and uncompelling. (The mom is sad. The dad is sad. The sister is sad. The murderer is bad and sad. Things Fall Apart.) No creativity AT ALL was involved in the writing of this book. So Susie narrates from heaven with courage and acuity? Big deal. Where's the spark? The resonance? The complex, three-dimensional characters? All I see is a contrived, sappy attempt at poignancy.But sheep would fawn over this book. And they have. It sure does ""pull"" ""at"" ""the"" ""heartstrings."""
3,Don't listen...,"To people who's reviews claim how horribly written a book is but can't manage to spell words correctly (it is character, not charachter) or form grammatically correct sentences.No, this may not become a classic. No, it isn't the best book I have ever read. It is interesting, thought provoking, and gives an interesting point of view on the issues of death, the afterlife, and the different ways people deal with tragedy. Read it if you like. I enjoyed it. But you don't know me so decide for yourself."
5,Enormous comfort,Reading this incredibly deft and redemptive novel was cathartic. The characters are so endearingly human and knowable. It is reassuring to travel with young Susie as she comes to understand how and why life goes on. Read it NOW.
4,A Visceral Experience,"Lovely Bones commanded my immediate and continued attention. I don't believe I have ever had such an emotional book-reading experience. I cried and sometimes sobbed through most of the book. It hit many nerves: many of us have deaths in our families we can hardly bare--deaths of brothers, fathers, kids in high school, children next door, soldiers in far away countries. A book like this rubs those emotions raw. I found it to be beautifully cathartic.There were loose ends and opportunities lost amongst the plotline--the ""heaven"" where Susie lived never quite took shape; the visitation to Ruth's body was a purposeless jolt.All-in-all, it was a very emotional, beautifully written book, especially for a first-time novel. I could easily see a cinematic version of this book but I doubt it could convey the visceral experience of the written version."
4,HARD TO STICK TO IT AT FIRST,"THIS WAS AN OK BOOK ONCE I GOT INTO IT. AT FIRST I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FOLLOWING IT. IT IS STRANGE, AND YET INTERESTING.IT CERTAINLY GIVE A PERSON A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. I DID ENJOY READING IT, AND WOULD SUGGEST IT TO SOMEONE ELSE TO READ."
4,"An easy read - compelling, thoughtful and very sad","When I first began to read the book, I couldn't put it down. It was a beautifully written sad story about loss and grieving and ultimately having to let go. I found that towards the end, as suspenseful as it had been the entire way through even though we knew who the killer was from the beginning, the story fades and becomes just another unbelievable tale. All in all, I enjoyed the book but wished that there was no Ruth but instead just the family and their lives - I wanted to see them going on with their lives even after such a tragic loss. Also, everything was too perfect at the end as we all know life never is."
1,Hallmark sex murders,"So I was another of the millions who felt the simply MUST read this book, if just to keep a toe in the zeitgeist. So many people, including friends I respect, loved it. By the end of it, I was thinking if maybe I should be rethinking my relationships. This was the worst book I have read in a long, long time. Hackneyed prose, hackneyed characters, nothing to redeem it whatsoever.And it could have been so good! There was the potential here for a sort of murder mystery from heaven, the potential to explore our questions about What Comes After and the devastation of those left behind in a new and intriguing way. But the author gave us nothing but a premise unfulfilled, a pack of palliative lies, and some of the worse writing about sex to come down the pike in years.Alice Seabold is rich, rich beyond her wildest dreams - good for her. Don't feel you need to contribute."
5,Strangely moved,Though it is a sad topic the story is in a strange way very uplifting. Definite must read.
5,A beautiful book.,"This may be the best book you'll read this year; perhaps the best book of 2002. Alice Sebold tells a chilling story without histrionics or sensationalism, and her self-discipline makes the story all the more poignant. If you want a first-hand experience with what writing should be, treat yourself to The Lovely Bones."
3,"Good story, but unhappy with the ending","I also was looking forward to reading this book. Seeing how a movie will be made of it soon, I wanted to read the book first. I was very perplexed that the only ""second"" chance that Susie had when she came back to earth she didn't help to find her killer, explain how she was killed, or where she was buried so her family could finally rest knowing what happened to her. I also was disappointed at how the murderer met his fate. I thought it lacked imagination.I would recommend this book as a quick read, but it wasn't as intense and thought provoking as I had hoped."
4,Interesting Approach,"Alice Sebold takes us on a unique journey to what she feels is everyone's unique heaven, told through the thoughts of a murdered 14 year old girl. From her treacherous rape and murder to her resolve of the fact that life must go on without her, a quite different approach in a life-after-death storyline takes place. As other reviewers before me have summarized the storyline, I will suffice it to say that The Lovely Bones turns out to be a good read although at times it can become very lengthy and somehow cause the reader to stray. I would definitely recommend sticking to it and finishing the book as there is no comparison to the movie. Hands down, don't see the movie until you have read the book. The book does not disappoint!"
4,Not what you expect,"The victim is the narrator, and she has a perspective on the events that follow. If you like neat endings tied up in ribbon, this is not for you."
2,Where are the Lovely Bones?,"Very good until the ending. I wish I had stopped reading before the last 2 chapters. However, I guess life is not always tied up nicely in little bows."
4,So much better than the movie,"Not that it's a surprise that the book would be better than it's film execution, but Lovely Bones is so much more enjoyable as a book. I don't typically dive into books of this genre (mix of murder mystery and afterlife-oriented), but found myself tearing through this in just a few nights.The crime element is well written, smart, and not overly gory or cliche. The aftermath/family angle is honest and genuine (though at times a bit tedious). The adolescent perspective is very heartfelt and ""real."" And the depiction of the afterlife is very unique.What the book gives you that is left out of the movie (SPOILERS AHEAD) - intro/overview of other victims, more insight into the murderer and his history, better detective work, more about the sister, more about the victim interacting from ""beyond,"" and better development of the murderer's final end."
5,A voice from the dead,I was fascinated by the presentation of the story from the perspective of the murdered girl. The author has presented a wonderfully intriguing pilgrimmage of the killers capture.
4,Eerie,I think the author did a great job of narrating this story from the viewpoint of the murdered person. She's got perspective and some emotional distance from what happened to her. Very interesting and a little eerie.
3,"Weird, weird, weird!","The author is excellent at descriptions and her writing style is good. She is also good at fillers in between dialogue. However the plot in this story is extremely weird. Susie Salmon is dead. She has been murdered but somehow using the body of Ruth, she returns to the living and has a love affair with Ray Singh, with whom she had shared a kiss before her untimely passing. The story climaxes when her sister decides to search the killer's house for clues, just as he is returning home. There is great tension building here, but then it all fizzles out. Several clues injected into the story lead to nowhere. Some information in the story seem pointless.Finally, in describing heaven as a place where a being craves to return to life, the author failed miserably in depicting MY heaven. Sorry."
5,LOVED IT!!,"This is one of my favorites. I could not put it down. IF you like The Lovely Bones, you may also want to read Lucky; another great book by Alice Sebold."
1,Sad to say it was a let down,"After reading about how wonderful this book is, and seeing its fabulous placement in the bookstores, I bought a copy for both my mom and I, thinking it would be great. After all, the premise is orginal, compelling...But neither of us could finish it. I made it to chapter 5 and my mom made it only to chapter 3. The protagonist, Susie, goes off on so many unimportant tangents, and the narrator (Susie, again) is portrayed to be omniscient--delving into everybody's thoughts--which I found hard to believe, and a bit irritating.Kudos to the book for the original storyline, but, for us, it was way too difficult to maintain interest in the storyline with all of the fluff.I'm happy that Sebold has been able to enjoy tremendous success with her debut novel--the dream of every aspiring author--but I found myself extremely disappointed, and I would not recommend the book, especially in hardcover."
3,On overall 'nice' novel,"Well, yes, most of the fan fare for this book is warranted.Though the concept isn't new - except for the idea that every person has his or her own heaven - it is well written and one can get emotionally involved in the novel (a good sign of a good read).It's great for the light reader."
3,Great writer...but the story was a little too farfetched...,"First of all I would like to say that I think Ms. Sebold is an excellent writer as far as writing goes, but her story was just a bit too farfetched to suit me. The thought of our dead loved ones spying on our every move after death was a little chilling and a tad over the top I thought. Will I read another book by this writer? You bet I will, I think Ms. Sebold has a lot of talent."
4,An Intriguing Perspective on the Afterlife!,"This book intrigued me from the very beginning. I tend to enjoy novels dealing with the relationship between the living and the dead and this was a remarkable example of just that. Ms. Sebold portrays the afterlife as a very personal experience - to each his/her own heaven ... or hell, for that matter. Susie, who was murdered at 14 years old, chooses to observe her family for many years, witnessing the effect that her death had on the lives of those she left behind.There were times when the book was a bit creepy, making me think that some dead person was watching my every move in a voyeuristic sort of way. And reading about the actions of a serial killer made me worry about my own children ...But it dealt so wonderfully with the process of mourning and letting go in times of great loss and it was also so marvelously suspenseful in certain parts that it was still a great read!"
4,Reads Like Poetry,"I loved this book. It reads like poetry in places and like a masterful mystery novel in others. It paints a detailed picture of the afterlife from the point of view of a murdered little girl. From ""her"" heaven she follows us through the sobering, surprising and suspenseful reality of her families lives after her death. This story is told with such sensitivity, it may move you to tears. On a brighter note, you are sure to meet a new friend during your commute by merely holding this very popular book. It is widely read for good reason. It's great."
4,Amazing,"great idea for a book, hauntingly beautiful, what a wonderful writer - this is a book I won't forget for a long time"
5,Good story...,This was a different approach to a dramatic story of a serial killer -- it humanizes the victim and has great insight as to the stress those connected to the horrible crime suffer.
5,Lovely Read,"This is one of my 7th grade students' favorite book. They fight over who gets to read it next, and it's hard to check out at the school library. A must have for a middle school LA teacher, or a parent who wants to get their kid hooked on books. Appropriate for both boys and girls."
1,Hated it!,"I hated this book! It started in an interesting way, and I thought it would be wonderful. It soon rambled off into kindergarten pnilosophy. The action is extremely slow and focus jumps around without apparent reason. The ending was very disappointing. There are no likable characters. The narrator at first seems likable and certainly sympathetic, but the reader soon becomes impatient with the snail's pace of the action and the pointless digressions. I stuck with it the book even though I was tempted to give up many times. It was a waste of time and money. I feel qualified to judge because I taught literature on the college level for many years."
4,The View from Heaven,"This book is not so much about murder as it is about grief. The narrator is a 14 year old girl in heaven looking down upon her family as they all go through the grieving process in different ways. This is a beautifully written novel that explores the so many different emotions that come with tragedy - anger, sadness and confusion. I don't want to give anything away - just know it's not your average murder mystery. The book is currently making it's way through my friends & family and each have enjoyed it a great deal."
3,Not the Best!,"I have to agree with ""What's the Fuss"". It was an ok read. however, hasn't this all been done before?"
4,"A Most Unusual, Hopeful and Touching Story","This book's unusual premise gives one pause to consider deeply how humans are affected by death, both here and on the ""other side"". If you are looking for a fantasy about what life after death is, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a whodunit, this is not your book. This book requires the reader to become more involved in the often overlooked and deeper result of the losses that those who are merely vouyers of crime seldom experience. The author challenges you by stretching your thinking past the obviouis criminology or emotional pain caused by a horrid act of violence. Having the victim tell the story herself is the key. So, no matter what your beliefs are about crime and life after death, I guarantee you'll find something within these pages that you hadn't thought of before."
2,Could have been better,"A good concept poorly executed. It opened promisingly and heartbreakingly -- those of you with adolescent daughters might really find the opening discomforting -- but quickly bogged down with weakly-developed characters, confusing time shifts and plot lines, and simplistic platitudes about love and loss.Unlike some of the others here, I didn't find this book spiritually hokey, I simply found it juvenile. It had the underdeveloped feel that I get when -- stuck for something to read -- I pick up a book that my 12-year-old daughter is reading. I don't regret reading it, butI wouldn't recommend it to anyone else as a great book to read.Sheri Reynolds covered similar ground with 5 star results in ""A Gracious Plenty."" I'd recommend that you read that book instead."
2,"Promising, but an ultimate failure","Sebold can write, but can she synthesize a plot, develop characters in a meaningful way, and create a well-rounded tale? No.The family dynamics illustrated after their daughters death felt like a strained attempt to create characters out of the famous stages of dealing with grief (denial, anger, depression...).The heaven Sebold describes is incredibly superficial (every wish is granted), unimaginative, and sentimental.Sebold tries to tackle far too much--too many characters and their emotional states, and she obviously adores nearly all of them, considering by the end, everyone's lives have become disgustingly and predictably ideal.The book does not come to any resolution, fruition, or conclusion, nor does it have any underlying message that I could glean from its pages."
3,"Very well written, but lacking in certain areas.","This book was written very descriptively. At time though I thought the book was disjointed. There were too many characters expressing their feelings and at times you had to switch gears too fast and move on to the next character.The story of Susie Salmon was very interesting. I felt that towards the end though the book was lacking-almost losing its momentum.I'm glad I read it, but it isn't on my list of favorites!"
2,Sentimental pap,"This book was recommended to me by a friend whose judgment I ordinarily trust. Unlike her promise, I couldn't wait to put it down! I don't mind well-written fantasy - say, Hundred Years of Solitude - but this just isn't close. It is cute, sentimental, a challenge to anyone's ability to suspend disbelief. Don't waste your time."
5,The Lovely Bones,"The Lovely Bones is about a girl named Susie Salmon. She was raped and murdered by her neighbor Mr.Harvey when she was 14 years old. Susie looks down and is watching her friends and family continue living their lives without her.My favorite part of the book is in the beginning when the police are looking for suspects. They come across a boy named Ray. He loved Susie, and they found a love note that he had wrote to her. That's why the police had originally thought of Ray as a suspect. Even though it was just a schoolboy crush, Ray still wrote Susie love notes.The Lovely Bones is one of my favorite books that I've ever read. It is filled with love in all types of ways. I would absolutely recommend this book. Especially to teenage girls because this entire book is fille with love. It is a little depressing though. I thought this book was especially good because i thought it was interesting listening to how Susie is watching life on Earth go on without her."
2,Disappointing,"The opening really made me want to read the book--it was edgy and well-written (and as to the complaints of its being grisly, well, of course it's grisly. It's about murder!). But I became increasingly disappointed as I kept reading. The writing degenerated into sentimental mush and got preachy and extremely strange at the end. Integrity was sacrificed for a happy ending. Very disappointing."
3,Disappointed,After having read the hipe and saw the placement of the book on the best sellers list I must say I was highly disappointed after having read the book.
1,rape=a fun read?,"The only people who would enjoy this book are the ones who think that reading a meaningless account of a young girl's rape/murder is fun.For the rest of us the book is horrifying, disturbing, and nauseating. It's also quite frustrating because the author foreshadows some sort of punishment for the rapist/murderer, but in the end the justice is tepid and disappointing.It would be one thing if the girl's suffering meant something within the book, but the author just uses that method of death for sensationalistic value. If she wanted to portray what dead people are thinking, why not have the girl die from something less horrific than rape/murder?Basically, the author exploits the topics of rape and murder and does nothing novel or interesting with them. Her book is a slap in the face to rape and murder victims and the people who love/d them."
3,"Clever idea, but didn't sustain it.","I give Alice Sebold high marks for originality; the idea of the story being told by the girl murdered in chapter one is clever. Unfortunately, though, the unfolding story fell far short of the hype - and became totally ridiculous when Susie came back to earth. Had Sebold focused on the hunt for the murderer it could have been much more interesting."
4,Interesting read,"I found this to be well written and I just couldn't put it down. It is an interesting story that encourages the reader to view life from a different angle. The story was a bit upsetting, but I would recommend it."
3,Highly readable - Potential not realized,"A very captivating and charming book, at least for the first half. It began to drag towards the middle. I felt as though the author had been pressed by editor/critics to lengthen the story, but she was unable to make the most of it in the end.There should have been more development of the murdered girl's hunt for the killer. Sebold hints at this, but seems to reject that side of the story for fear of appealing to sensationalism. The conclusion of the story does nothing to bring about the girl's conception of heaven, which I thought was the main part of the story. Her heaven doesn't get much different at all. The victim is told to shake off the burden of her murder; in fact negativity seems to pervade her heaven all the more in the end, until she's surrounded by dead people! This is heaven?Still, an involving and interesting read."
2,Unusual but not great,"In Chapter I, a 14-year-old girl, Susie, is raped and murdered. She narrates the story from heaven. She doesn't make heaven sound attractive, nor does she seem particularly happy there. She is more concerned with the people she left back on earth. The heaven parts and what the author imagined its residents can do were boring and not very believable..... Most of the characters seemed more isolated from each other than from Susie. I didn't see any preparation or motivation for the mother's sudden desire to have sex with the detective working on her daughter's death. The neighbors gathering spontaneously in a cornfield for an impromptu memorial service on the first anniversary of Susie's death seemed corny.There are too many things wrong with this book to list them all. It has a few good moments, ..."
4,The Lovely Bones is an interesting tale told from an even mo,"The novel, unlike most stories that focuses around a murder, begins with the murder scene with a chillingly vivid description of the act. Our story is then told from the eyes of the victim watching down on Earth from her heaven.Susie Salmon, ""like the fish,"" is a girl left perpetually 14, her age at her time of death. Her tail is beautifully told. Her voice, sometimes sounding so young and childish, sometimes wise beyond her years, is typical of her age and ads depth to her character.The story is suspenseful, enthralling and atypical of a novel involving a murder in that the killer is revealed within the first few pages of the book to the reader but not to the characters. The story is a beautiful commentary on growing up and grief. The author breaches many touchy subjects such as teenage sexuality, religion, belief in the afterlife and the supernatural with gentle hand.Expertly written and a must read."
2,Give me a break...,"this is so not the best book of the summer. The great writing is all that saves an overwise dreary and unbelievable tale. I liked Susie's view of heaven. I did not like the ""body-snatching of a former friend so she could sleep with a boy"" scene. That completely lost the book for me. It was compelling enough to read, but it is not compelling enough to be the must-read book of the summer!"
3,Good book.,"I found the book to be quite good. It starts well, and improves halfway through, and then suddenly deflates. It leaves the reader wanting more. It's like taking you up a mountain, the scenic route, to the top. It's beautiful all the way up there. But as soon as you're up there, you look down and it is empty. You get dizzy and you feel like the whole trip amounted to naught.The last quarter was disappointing."
4,Lovely story,"This is a very enjoyable story although its subject matter is sad. I like the way the author ties everything together, a very nice job writing. The parallel stories work well together and the sad emotions are touched on be not dwelled upon. You recognize the sadness is there but its presentation does not detract from telling the story. Well worth reading."
4,Great Book!,"This was one of the best books I've ever read. I am so interested in this type of stuff, not the rape- but the spiritual essence. It's definatly worth reading!"
4,Excellent book!,"This book is really good but it was really hard to read. Usually I can sit down and read a book in a few hours but with this book it took me a few months. I would start it and have to put it down. It just brings so much emotion with it. But, I would reccomend it."
3,A strong beginning and a weak ending...,The beginning was very promising. A strong story with even stronger characters then a strong fizzle. What happened to George Harvey? For so long he was on the run and then he slips...I felt the author grew tired of the story and just quickly put a closing to it all. I would recommend this book to anyone in a book club. It will give something for everyone to discuss.
4,"A gripping, easy-to-read book, but a not light-hearted story","Compared to music categories, I would definitely place this book rather in the ""commercial"" genre. But - and that's what I like about it - commercial, easy-to-read with quality.The book deals with the rape and murder of 14-year-old Susie Salmon and the way her family copes with this loss after her death. On every move of her sister Lindsey, her little brother Buckley, her parents and her murderer, Susie is watching from heaven.There are moments when you will feel tears getting in your eyes, small details that show how much Alice Sebold knows about the pain and fear she is writing about. If you are looking for a stirring, fine little novel you will not be able to put down easily, go for it. You will not be disappointed."
2,What Am I Missing Here?,"I couldn't wait to begin reading and had expectations of a great book, engrossing and compelling. After only a few chapters, I realized this book wasn't going to be the ""literary find"" I was hoping for; I had to force myself to read a few chapters each evening and was determined to make it all the way through. Needless to say, I was disappointed; I really can't find anything good to say about the book. I feel as though I wasted many hours trudging through it with the hope that the ending would be worth the time. Again, sorry - the ending was just as disappointing as the rest of the story. Good thing I didn't pick it to read while on vacation. . ."
1,didn't do it for me,"I read the first few chapters and wasn't at all involved. The 14 year old didn't seem like a 14 year old. Heaven didn't seem like much of a heaven. Trying to give it a chance, I continued on. Never did any of the characters touch me in any way...Never did I really care. Never did I forget that I was reading a book and that it seemed to be tedious at that. ..Finally, 3/4 of the way thru I gave up and gave it away.I want a novel to surround me, involve me. I hate the feel of required reading and there was nothing here to make me feel otherwise."
1,1 star is too many,"Unable to fathom the hoopla surrounding this book. I was so anxious to read it, only to be profoundly disappointed. The plot gave me nightmares and the fantasy element in the book was annoying. The one redeeming value of this book is that it is relatively short."
1,The Lovley Bones,"I first picked up this book at my boyfriends house and began reading out of curiosity. After the first chapter I was hooked and bought my own copy the same day on amazon.com. To my dissapointment the first chapter was the climax of the book. The middle of the novel was entertaining but moved less than quickly and I felt myself skimming past some of the ending chapters. By the last chapter I was down right bored, what was the whole point of this book again?"
5,Emotional Journey,"I loved this book, it captured the true essence of what life must be like for the families left behind when children are taken or killed, well beofre their time.As the book starts off, Susie Salmon, is already dead, and speaking to us from ""her"" heaven. The book is both sad and joyus, thought provoking, and angering.We get to see the lives of her family fall apart, and the life of her killer, from before he took her from this world.A wonderful read, bring the Kleenex on!"
2,"Well, it's a good YA title: reminiscent of other YAs read","I certainly won't forget this book, parts of it. But it won't be one of my favorites. That wouldn't keep me from recommending it. Heavens! Everyone to his or her own choosing, is my thought!But I got a bit tired of the heavenly circumstances and the fact that nothing would really be resolved. And having read the blurb from respected writer Anna Quindlen on the back cover, comparing this book to To Kill A Mockingbird, just makes me wonder who was paying her to write the blurb.The tragedy of this girl's death, horrible murder and rape and slaughter, and the continued life of her serial murderer is sickening. Justice played out by nature is good, even humorous; unexpected, yet predictable.I know this is a best seller, a runaway best seller, but I am glad I did not rush out to get it. I would have been disappointed. Am I glad I read it? Of course! I don't want someone else to make up my mind for me.Would I recommend it? Not without reservation."
3,The Lovely Bones... not as lovely as i expected...,"I just finished this book last night, and although i enjoyed it... i must admit that i expected a little too much out of it because it was getting such great reviews. As i have read in a previous review, there were too many instances in the story that did not really belong... the ending was also a little abrupt. She watches her family for eight and a half years then comes down to earth for a little romp in a shack then leaves and can all of a sudden live peacefully in heaven without her family? in some ways it made sense, but for the most part, there was something missing. I recommend this book to everyone, but as far as the writing goes... i just didn't clash very well with it."
3,EH It was okay - BUT,Like the previous reviewer - I too and kind of ticked with myself of falling into the media hype about this book....IT WAS NOT THAT GOOD.Good stuff - Yes it was a different perspective in hearing the victim tell the story. Not the usual cop/detective trying to be the voice of the victim. The victim in this story seemed very sweet and young and still trying to figure out what life was all about even though she no longer had one.Bad stuff - The story was a tad boring at times plus exploring how a family can be completly torn apart and then brought back together in the last oh say 10 pages....nope not good enough for me. If your going to explore the family being ripped apart at least explore how they rebuild and become whole again. My other grievance is some of the passages were just way to sappy - to many to name - so if you want to know you will have to read it yourself.Was it a good book...no not really....was it interesting enough to hold my attention. Yes.
1,A waste of time,The book would have been perfect if it ended at the first chapter. The concept of the story is good but was poorly writen. The story went on and on and on... then ended.A good idea gone bad.
2,Like a cheap Hollywood tearjerker,"On a trip to Vancouver I learned about this book during a CBC book review program, called HotType.The story is about a young girl, brutally murdered, witnessing her family coping with the reality of her death from her personal heaven and magically revealing herself to some people from time to time.The story lingers, and lingers, and it suddenly struck me that the book was exactly like one of these cheap hollywood tearjerkers, the one's that give Hollywood it's name for bad taste and need for special effects (read: girl in heaven revealing herself etc etc - drama - blah blah - etc.).If you like this type of hollywood film, this book might be for you. If you like literature: skip it."
2,Just Okay,"When I first started reading this book I remember thinking -- wow, this is good but right now I'm at about the fourth or fifth chapter and I'm getting bored with it. I don't even know if I'll finish it."
2,Too much hype,"I was so excited to read this book because of all the media-hype surrounding it- it was the first book I've seen in a long time that actually got a commercial promo. But once I started reading it, I had to force myself to get to the end. In theory, this is a great premise for a story- something fresh and new- but I thought that Sebold could have executed this story so much better, with a little more character development and a better demise for the murderer, which I found very disappointing. I think that there are many books worthy of publicity that never receive it- this was not one of them."
4,The Lovely Bones,This book is beautifully written. It's truly worth reading and I would recommend this to everyone.
4,Grabs your attention in the first line,"I read several different types of books, but this one was different. It grabbed my attention with the first line, and was never able to put it down. This was the first book that I read that had the climax in the first 3 pages.Lovely Bones gives an incredible view of what someone may see from heaven. I began to look forward to what Susie saw on earth and how she viewed her heaven.This is a great novel to those who are just looking to fall into a book."
3,beginner effort,"I went to school with Alice Sebold, so I was curious to read this, though I didn't know her well. I hesitated for over a year due to the subject, because I have a 14 yr old daughter. The first third of the book was difficult and moving as a parent, but well-written --the stuff of great literature. Halfway through the book it disappointingly retreats to mediocrity. The already thin characters struggle to prove their worthiness to the reader. The theme fades in and out. Details don't make sense--in one scene it's summer, but they build a fire to keep warm. Other scenes leave you scratching your head searching for the relevancy to the theme. Overall I enjoyed the book, but felt it could have either used another edit or been much shorter. The biggest injustice to Ms. Sebold was by the publisher's marketing on the back cover of the paperback which states something like ""A Jack Grissham like page turner."" Ms. Sebold writes much better than Mr. Grisham."
5,Both Intriguing and Polarizing,"Why polarizing? I have found that people tend to love or despise this book. I find myself much more on the ""love"" side of the fence, if for no other reason than for the daring, unique viewpoint of the main character. She is dead, and is in heaven, describing things as she sees them on earth as well as describing her death. It was somewhat like passing a car wreck on the highway-- you stare, both compelled to look and repelled by what you see.This book is bound to be a classic, and I think it deserves that fate. I agree with some of the other reviewers that it has weak spots, especially toward the end, but who said books have to be perfect?"
5,A Great Surprise,"I picked up this book in the summer for about 5 bucks on the clearance shelf at Waldenbooks. I had heard of it before.Any aspiring author should read this book. It is beautifully crafted. The plot is complex. It is a page-turner that you can easily stay up all night to read. The best part of the book is how the author lets you know lots of follow-up details about the secondary characters. You have a few questions at the end, but most of them are answered."
4,The Lovely Bones,"The Lovely Bones by: Alice Sebold, is about a fourteen year old girl named Susie Salmon. Susie gets murdered by a teacher named Goerge Harvey. When she dies she goes into her own version of heaven. While she is there she realizes how her death effected many people. Some of my favorite parts in this book is when Susie's father notices her presence. Another one of my favorite parts is when everyone that Susie knew (and more) made a bonfire to remember her. Those parts were very heart warming.I would recomend this book to anyone over the age of 11. Also if you are someone who doesn't like books that are graphically described then i would not recomend this book to you. If you like touching stories then this is a great book. It also may teach you something about understanding families who have lost a loved one."
1,disturbing,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone nor would I advise anyone to read it.yes - maybe it's well written but I found the book to be very shocking, upsetting + not the least bit entertaining."
2,Ugh,"This book was truly stupid. The disintegration of the family theme following the murder of a child is an interesting one - but the ""device"" of the girl looking down from heaven didn't work for me - it was just too stupid. Sorry I can't suspend my disbelief, but I can't believe this is at the top of the best sellers' list..."
2,LAME,I struggled through this book because my daughter wanted me to read it. I would have saved the effort after the first 50 pages if I had not been trying to spare my daughter's feelings.Boring...a waste of time and brain cells.
3,not that bad,"Boy, some people really hated this book! My only complaint is that it is littered with florid prose. I mean, it borders on gibberish at times. Other than that, I thought it was fairly interesting because of the perspective it was told from--a dead girl in heaven."
3,That's Really 2 1/2 Stars,"This book started off terrifically. It had everything: terror, bittersweet sadness, anger, beauty. Then it eventually fell apart with the inclusion of the sister and boyfriend story, which was just icky. It left a bad taste."
2,Did not live up to the hype!,"I was away on business and forgot a book. So I went to the local BN and bought this book since I heard so much hype about it. The book started well, but lost steam for me. I finished the whole book but I do not think it lived up to the hype at all, much less enough for it to make it into a film. The advertisements around this book offered hope, and there is none to offer at the end of this book. I understand that evil doers do not always get caught, but I still felt very unsatisfied. Some of the concepts in the book was a bit too out there for me too. Overall, I was disappointed."
4,A Heaven for everyone,"This book is very moving. We watch what happens through Susie's eyes as she is lured by one of her neighbors into a hole in a cornfield, raped and murdered. Her family and friends are torn apart by her disappearance. While they can never find the body that police come to a conclusion that she is murdered. Susie lives through watching her family and following her murderer. She seems to appear to them without meaning to which gives us that feeling that maybe the dead really can see us. Her brother seems to see her more than anyone else and is a sweet child who just lives his life in the now. This book I believe would be great for anyone coping with a recent death because it gives us hope that they are okay and have their own great Heaven."
2,Found myself rolling my eyes often,"There were many places in this book where I found myself rolling my eyes and saying, ""Oh, come on."" The writing is serviceable but not literary. Almost every plot point could be anticipated. I suppose its premise is somewhat original, but rather than feeling much emotion while reading this book, I just wanted it to be over with. Having had a teen-age friend murdered, I thought I would feel something more: my point being, I SHOULD have, but the book just didn't rise to that level. I found it to be simplistic and, frankly, sappy."
1,Drivel,This book is complete and utter drivel. It is poorly written and inconsistant. I don't understand how or why it is on the best-seller list. The author uses every overly dramatic movie-of-the-week cliche in this book. My theory as to why this book is so popular is that some marketing/advertising hot-shot remembered this piece of [junk] sitting on his or her shelf when the rash of missing girls occurred and decided to capitalize on these tragedies. A huge marketing campaign took place with this book when it first came out. There were even TV commercials for it. I find the whole timing of this book's popularity very disturbing.
4,The Lovely Bones,When I picked up The Lovely Bones I thought it an odd title but after reading the jacket cover I thought I would give it a try. I am glad I did. Alice Sebold tells a wonderful story with humor and agony. I found myself shedding a few tears along with a chuckle every now and then. I could not put this book down and finsihed in one day. I see great things ahead for Ms. Sebold based on this book. If you want to lose yourself in a story that shows the dark side of Earth as well as the hope of heaven then I would recommend this book.
1,Good start fooled me,"I have to agree with most of the other critics: this book starts well, in true page-turner style, then it sadly loses focus and ends up fading out tediously, not quite knowing what it wants to say. Obviously written with a movie in mind, complete with soppy-sad Hollywood happy-end. Very disappointing."
5,"Dear Me, How Can Anyone Not Like This Book?","I do not know why some readers berate Alice Sebold and ""The Lovely Bones"". What does it take? I would think it would be quite riveting for all, especially those who have ever lost a loved one. The way Alice Sebold presented the entire book within the framework of a fantasy, beginning in heaven, is wonderful. It reminds me of the well known Christmas fiction movie ""It's A Wonderful Life"" by Frank Capra, and the lesser known postmodern nonfiction book ""West Point..."" by Norman Thomas Remick. If you enjoy ""Heavenly"" presentations of wonderful stories like these, you should certainly find that Alice Sebold's ""The Lovely Bones"" is heavenly."
3,Word of Warning,"This book powerfully conveys the emotional anguish of its main characters, but it was too disturbing for me to finish, even though I generally like serious subjects. It includes vivid descriptions of a young girl's rape and murder, and heart-rending descriptions of her family's nearly unbearable sorrow. I bought this book at the airport just before departing for my honeymoon, and it was pretty effective at replacing my post-wedding high with haunting visions of violence and despair."
5,MEV from SOA 8th grade,"The Lovely Bones by Alice Seabold is an amazing book! I read it in under a week; i could not put it down! It was a little bit disturbing at the beginning, but that was mostly because I was the same age as the main character, Susie Salmon. I can honestly say that I have never read anything like it and I probably never will, unless, of course, Alice Seabold writes any other books for people my age. It is full of sorrow and revenge and betrayal and romance. It ends in the most amazing way, so amazing it was almost beautiful. It was also really interesting because of the point of view, or at least the state of the main character. It begins like so: "" My name was Salmon, like the fish....""As it clarifies in the sentences that follow, the main character is deceased and throughout the entire book she is watching over all of the people she grew up with from a distance."
4,"Drags a bit, but great for book clubs","This was third time reading this book. Once on my own and twice now for a book club. I remember really liking it the first time I read it, but perhaps because it does tend to drag on a bit in the middle, the last two times haven't been as enjoyable. The writing is really outstanding this book, the author brings you along for the story. It feels like she's not telling you the story, but letting the story tell itself.As I mentioned, the middle of the book drags a bit, the story gets a little bogged down as time seems to move on aimlessly. You want something to happen - anything really, but instead we just watch both worlds move along at a snail's pace.Having said that, the story is compelling, it opened up some very interesting discussions and I'm glad I read it. But the next book club that chooses it, I'm not reading it again."
3,It started out well...,"I really enjoyed the book at first. It had an interesting and unique view of life and death. However, the ending was completely random and rediculous. I won't give away the ending, but those of you who have read it know what I'm talking about. It's given more credit than it deserves."
3,Good but somewhat scattered,"I admit the book was haunting, and it has left an impression that is still lingering 3 days later, but I also don't think that it lived up to the hype. But more specifically, I had the impression, time and again as I was reading it, that the book was somewhat scattered. It was as if tiny portions of themes never developed, or perhaps edited out, were excised in a sloppy sort of way, leaving half developed thoughts and characters dangling. If I could ask the author one nagging question, in particular, it would be this: What did Mrs. Singh mean when she said of Ruth ""I will start with her"" (something along those lines, anyway). It's as if a story that never went anywhere, or a piece of character development that was excised was done in an incomplete way. Or am I missing something?A good book, but not the earth-shaking masterpiece that some would have you believe."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Sometimes the public is swept up in the hype of a product that delivers less than it claims to offer. The Lovely Bones is no exception. This novel is purported to be an insightful view of death, what tragedy means for survivors, and how those survivors navigate lives without someone they love; instead, it reads like a fictionalized account of a ""Touched by an Angel"" episode. The only force propelling this narrative forward was my dim curiosity about what would happen to Susie's killer - hardly the emphasis the author intended, I suspect. Additionally, Susie's experiences in heaven sound not unlike how purgatory is often described. An overly simplistic novel whose runaway success is most likely motivated by its I-Can-Read language and its appeal to sensitive types who watch PAX."
3,What a scary thought!,"I have not read all of ""The Lovely Bones"" yet but what I have read so far I love. It is very interesting and it gets your attention. To think that my parents would go a couple days with out knowing where my body was or if I was even dead would be a very scary thought. For now on I will watch my brothers and sisters when I let them out. Usually I just let them go and tell them to check in but now I will keep an eye out for them. The murderer being their next door neighbor is even a freakier thought. If I had to take a second thought of one of my neighbrs like that I would not even think about talking to them oro even going to their house."
2,Not what I expected,"Many people recommended this book to me. The first quarter of the book captured my interest with the crime, but failed to keep me going. I skimmed the book very quickly for the second half and put it down. I am glad I did not purchase the book."
2,The glass is half full,"This book is very well written for the first few chapters. Alice Sebold does a great job of developing characters and starting a plot line. Unfortunately this book should have been written as a short story, because after the main plot line develops in the first few chapters - nothing new happens. This book remains very dismal until the end. The mood about how a family deals with death is well developed in the first half of the book and regurgitated in every chapter after that. Alice Sebold had many opportunities to liven up the book with some humor, but passed. I would recommend reading the first half of The Lovely Bones and leave it at that."
4,A view of heaven from a child's eye,"My partner brought me this book, thinking that it was something that I would pick out for myself, had I been at the store with her. Boy, was it the book for me. I had not yet heard any of the publicity on the book, so I did not have any preconcieved notions. This author brought out what I think heaven would be like, in some ways. She was able to keep the reader turning the page to see what was going to happen next, to see how life could go on. My one and only complaint, is that the ending was not what I thought it should be. But when she writes again, I will be there to read it."
3,"Well, I didn't hate it.","But then I wouldn't say I liked it either. It's a memorable book and the premise is interesting. In the beginning I thought it was going to be one of those 'wow' books but somewhere in the middle it kind of lost me and by the end I was just plugging away so I could say I finished it. I was completely disappointed by the ending- don't want to spoil it, but there are surprises at the end of books/movies that are a payoff, and then there are surprises that you just look at the last page and think...""what??"""
3,Boring,"I've heard such rave reviews about this book, it might have set me up for failure. I really never got into it, and struggled to finish it."
4,Not bad,"I loved parts, hated others. I found the end, ended too abruptly. It feels like two books. The first 85% is a suspense/how do you go on, and the last 15% is ""say what??? I read all of this for THAT ending"" but overall a great book."
4,Haunting,"A horrifyingly descriptive story with a triumphant finish. Takes you into the mind of the killer, the victim, and the survivors."
1,"A meaningless, empty book!!!",This book left me totally cold. It's hard to feel sad about a girl's death when she is the narrator AFTER it. She seemed very alive and not really suffering too much. Especially with the assertion that in heaven you have only to wish for something to make it happen. The story of her murder is equally proposterous. It seems impossible for the murderer to have done everything that he did and never be seen by anyone especially given the location of the crime scene. Her parents reactions seem forced as if the writer had a list of the steps that a grieving family goes thru and went down it one by one checking off emotions. The ending left me completely unsatisfied. It was totally contrived and obviously constructed to tie up any loose ends without thought to wether or not it made sense.
2,Bang then a whimper,"Chalk it up to to having read too many stellar reviews or having spent the summer talking myself into reading a book about a child raped and murdered, but now that I am finished, I admit, I am disappointed.In some eerie ways, the best of the book rests in its first few chapters. These are lucid, and raw and painfully descriptive--the murder, the early mourning, the landscape...As time moves on, however, the book devolves into an odd light touch. Susie lilts from place to place, person to person, commenting on their behaviors and actions. While you sense her longing to be back there in the thick of it, as a reader, you're not so certain you want to be there.Sometimes, you feel angst and sympathy, even empathy for the characters, but everyone is so lightly painted. It is hard to grasp on to something worth caring about for more than a moment or two. ..."
1,Why do people like this book?,"I had read all the glowing reviews of this book in newspapers and magazines, saw the author interviewed on the today's show, read the mostly 5-star reviews other people gave the book on this website, and heard a friend of mine simply rave about it--so I bought it and could not even force myself to finish it. The premise was so creative and it could have been a great story. Yet, the writing was so basic and not flowing. It was painful. I knew as soon as I read the first silly description of Heaven, including a Heaven in-take counselor, that reading this book was a mistake. Why do people like this book??"
3,"interesting, but that's it","The first 2/3 of the book are interesting, fast paced (let's face it, it's a one afternoon read). The last 1/3 of the book breaks down and falls apart and gets into territory that isn't consistent w/the rest of the book. And the last 1/3 crams too much and changes the pace of the rest of the book just to wrap up the story."
3,What's all the hype?,"I don't quite understand what the hype is about. The story moved too slowly for me. There was a lot of description and detail - a lot of which I felt unnecessary - that slowed the story down. This is a contemplative book, not a page-turner. More time is spent on long descriptions than on the events of the story. Also, there is no sense of justice for Susie's murder. Mr. Harvey's ultimate fate seems hallow and empty and the murder is never solved. The family never gets a real sense of closure, but just kind of falls to pieces ... Not a depressing book, but far from satisfying, either."
4,"lovely, but heavy","I read the book Lovely Bones and thouroghly injoyed it. i thought it gave incredible perspectives on life and death. Alice (Seblod) wrote discriptivly and on opinon. It started out with a visule sceen. A 15 year old girl got raped. I loved this book, however i thought it was rough. Im not sure what the age recomended for it is, but it should be at leest 13+."
2,I was disappointed,"I was looking forward to this book because of the terrific reviews. It was definitely a page-turner for the first chapter, then it was all downhill for me. I did not think it was such a terrific description of heaven! I hope heaven is not just wishing you are back on earth or living the lives of those you left behind with them. Not since ""Cold Mountain"" have I been so disappointed by a best seller. I would have liked this book better if the murder victim had just helped to solve the crime or recount how it was solved. Everything else was boring and pitiful."
2,Death of a great premise,"I was surprised that this book was so simplistically written. I thought some philosophical and even metaphysical aspects of life and death would be delved into, but this is a sing songy children's book that at times is just plain annoying. The character development ranged from shallow to non existent and the heavenly narratives by the dead girl are weak. If you want some originality and a thought provoking read pick up PREY by Michael Chrichton and CLONED LOVE by Thorne Peters. This novel I thought was just drivel."
5,Really good!,I'm not a big reader but I truly enjoyed reading this. The storyline was excellent and very well written. I loved it!
4,A good book,This book was easy to read although sometimes depressing. It has me rooting for the murderer to be caught the whole way through while still showing what loss does to a family.
3,The first 3/4 of the book are good.........,"This book was excellent up until the last 4 chapters or so. I loved that Sebold told the story from the point of view of the murder victom and followed all of her family members and friends as they dealed with her death over the years. The plot continued to build and build only to fall flat, creating a lowsy ending. I almost wonder if the author had no idea how she wanted the story to end and hurridly threw one together. I still think it was a good read but the ending does not do justice to the rest of the book."
3,"Very good, but then....","I listened to the audiobook version of The Lovely Bones. I really enjoyed the book and its imaginative view of Susie's heaven. I was also absorbed with her family and how they handled her death, especially her father. Her father grieved for her while trying to remain strong, clinging to his other children, and plotting vengence on the man who murdered her. He remained focused and committed in many ways, unlike her mother who had an affair and then abandoned her family. I enjoyed the first, three quarters of the book.However, towards the end, I was disappointed with the ""intimate"" interaction between Ray and Ruth/Susie...It was more like a useless, delusional dream state to me...and I was also disappointed that Mr. Harvey was never really punished for his crimes. In the end, he died freakishly, but he also got away with murders for so many years."
1,Plain ordinary,"I found it so very hard to finish this book. It seemed to have a nice plot but the build up of the story and the characters was so ordinary. The novel being narrated by the dead girl, there is a subtle undertone of humor in the narration. Whereas, all the living characters have a sense of tragedy and loss enveloping them. However the story failed to evoke any emotion and I felt like a dead reader not feeling anything. It was such a boring reading that I gave up and could never finish the book to the last page."
3,Life After Death Story,"I just finidshed this book and wonder if anyone else thinks heaven is ""like that"". First few chapters make you sad as you read about the rape of a 14 year-old (detailed), conversation between raper and Susie, murder and death, and a dog finding her elbow!At some monents Sebold makes unpredicted moves like turning Susie's mother into a marriage cheater after daughter's death and sleeping with the detective, after which she runs away for years and leaves two children and a husbnad. Or makes Susie's soul enter another woman's body and make love to the guy she was in love with. There a few love making scenes, as well as body admiring aspects.It's more like another evening news story but the intersting thing is that the whole story/novel was told by a dead person from the heaven."
3,Disappointing--Merely Adequate,"I am an English teacher. Granted, I just finished reading ""The Great Gatsby"" for the umpteenth time, but I was disappointed by Sebold's book. I was looking for a lyrical read--full of unique, provocative turns of phrase that make a book experience into a vision--disappointed. I was looking for resolution at the end, but I feel the end of the book was weak. I found myself much more interested in the tidbits about the life of the criminal, but these were served up sparingly. The mother's reaction to events is also perplexing as presented by the author, not ambiguous in the positive, artistic sense but incomplete might be a better way of putting it, or inhabited by a psychology that doesn't make sense. It's not a great book, but an okay book. A quick read. Merely adequate with room for improvement. Probably will make a better film adaptation...reads a bit like a screenplay in prose."
2,"OK, but not a classic","I read this book to see if it could be possibly as good as it has been hyped, and because I heard the author interviewed on the radio and felt sympathy for her horrific experience. One of the blurbs proclaimed that this book would be as classic as To Kill A Mockingbird. I don't think so. A classic is a book that transcends time, whereas this is a book that very much speaks to our anxieties of the moment, while the Jon Benet and the Elizabeth Smart cases are still in our minds, and our nation has been terrorized by an evil man just like this child was. It seemed to have too much that was unnecessary to the story. What was the point of Ruth's meandering around New York?"
4,A gutsy lady,"Wow! This lady had some nerve to write such a quirky story. What a risk this book takes. Like Kurt Vonnegut's 'Happy Birthday Wanda June.' That's what this reminds me of. I found this when I was on the Amazon page for 'Rich Man's Coffin,' another good book which a lot of people are getting in addition to this book for some reason. I think they are similar in their unique approach to writing."
4,Washington State Mom,It was an excellent book! A very interesting read...I couldn't put it down! This book wasn't as sad as I oridinally thought it would be. It was actually uplifting and very thoughtful. Definitly a book to read!
4,very moving and engaging book,This book had me thinking about death and those left behind in a detached and thoughtful way. nice book.
2,Not that great,"I found this book super boring. It was a struggle to finish it. Dont buy it, get it at the library."
1,Tough to get through,"After hearing all of the rave reviews I was totally disappointed in this book. I forced myself to read the first half, the second half got a little better, but it was still a chore to pick it up. I had read that it was about a murdered girl who was trying to help her father find her body. Not once in the book do I remember that happening. Not an exciting ending either. Just blah. I can't believe they are making a movie out of it. Good luck with that!"
3,Creepy,"Started out interesting, ended up just creepy.Lost interest after several chapters.Glad I got it on Kindle, less investment and don't have make a trip to Library to donate."
3,Good enough to keep my interest,"So this review will not contain a summary of the book. Just what I thought about it.A co-worker recommended this book fm me. He said that the authors idea was brilliant and original. I wouldn't go that far. It is different.It wasn't a can't put down book for me, but it wasn't so boring that I gave up reading the book. It did keepme interested enough to keep reading the book.This isn't a mystery or even a suspense. It's more like what happens after she dies for herself and her family.The beginning of the book grabbed and kept my interest, the middle had me barely hanging on, and the end left me feeling, ""that's it???"""
4,Touching,"What a wonderful book. Sensitively written about a very sad topic. Yet the author succeeded in not making the book sad, but a wonderful depiction of a family's grief and growth. I can't believe I waited so long to read this. I will definitely read it again."
5,Wonderful Book - don't be put off by the subject,"I delayed getting The Lovely Bones, because the subject matter sounded so depressing. And it was, but it was also uplifting. And the end, the final sentence, gave me such a rush I started crying. DON'T PEEK AHEAD. It will mean nothing to you unless it is read in context.I'm currently reading Lucky by the same author. Also depressing subject, but just as wonderfully written as The Lovely Bones. I love this author!"
4,Read her autobiography,"Alice Sebold's autobiography, Lucky, is amazing. It's some of the best writing I've read in a very long time! I lent it to someone who'd read Lovely Bones, and she read Lucky in a weekend, returned it to me saying she was going to buy copies of it for her family members."
4,Lovely and life affirming,"This is really an extraordinary, beautifully written book that finds something life affirming in the greatest of tragedies. Its characters are fascinating, and the writing is compelling. Since reading it, I have been on a quest to read more good stories about life and death, what we can learn about life from the dying, etc...and I thought reading real life accounts would be a good way to get into that. Tuesdays With Morrie is great and so is a brand new book entitled It's All Good: Emails From A Dying Best Friend by Jonathan Widran (Xlibris). It's about an extraordinary friendship and centers around the often humorous, always life affirming emails the two exchanged in the months before one of them died. Takes you through the process in a gripping way, poetically, and shows the value of faith in the process, and what we learn by just being there for others. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed Alice's book!"
3,FAIR,"Although the story dragged a bit at times, it held my interest in spite of the gore. What I think I wanted to read was Susie's return, which of course was impossible. I could not understand why Abigail left the family. Seibold's definition of Santa Rosa, CA as ""upscale"" is laughable, as it never was and to this day not.I final part of the book was slow and boring, no answers and no direction."
2,Okay...I guess...,"The first few chapters are interesting, but soon I found myself skipping past chapters to learn more about the murderer, who I thought was one of the more interesting characters in the novel. The novel's text is simplistic, tasteful (nothing so incredibly graphic) and somewhat realistic. But the whole heaven idea...it's been done. The heaven in the novel is an incredibly cliched version... And the writer had such an interesting and imaginative veiwpoint..why couldn't she use the same effort to create a new veiw of 'heaven'?"
1,Disappointing!,"I had never read Alice Sebold before, but I was very disappointed in this book. This book was very disturbing. There are so many horrific things going on in the real world and when you read, most of us would like to escape from all the ""reality"" of the world. The author I'm sure is a very good writer, but the ending of this book was rushed. I would not recommend this book to anyone, as a matter of fact I have told people not to read it."
4,made me think,"I found the actual story itself good but it was the questions raised in my own mind that the most compelling. Placing myself in Susie's place lead me to thinking about what the scereno would be like with my life today, as opposed to a young girl It also stirred a strange sense of peace for me as I thought about the transitions we make through life, and the hereafter."
2,To much hype,"I had heard how great this book was, but it was unable to keep with my expectations. Maybe I was in more in the mood for a light-hearted feel good book when I started, but I just did not find it as wonderful as others talked about. I do think the vantage of a girl from heaven telling the store was cleaver, but the store beyond that did not keep my attention. I found it highly predictable."
5,Can't let go,"You must IMMEDIATELY go out and buy the book, ""The Lovely Bones,"" by Alice Sebold. It is haunting, powerful, sad but insatiable. At times, I just had to look away and contemplate. There are parts that I had to stop reading to dry my eyes. The book took me to lonely but unavoidable places which in real life, I can't seem to avoid going some days."
2,Movie of the week,"When I read the blurb for The Lovely Bones, I had no idea how popular it was. Then I bought it and read it and have no idea why it's so popular. The plot is an interesting one. The beginning is very strong and emotional. Yet beyond the beginning and the promising plot is really just bad writing. The dialogue alone is laughable and made me(when I wasn't laughing) cringeing at some of the VERY sappy sentiments. Yes this is an emotional subject matter, but that doesn't excuse lines such as ""she seasoned her toast with her tears"" GOD! Who wrote this, a 16 year old? This novel reads as though Sebold took a creative writing course and took everything that the hack that taught it told her to write, seriously. If you're interested in how a family copes with the murder of a daughter in a realistic way, I wouldn't say this is the book. But I'm sure it will be a movie! Hopefully the screen writer will be better than Sebold!"
2,A Complete Let Down...,"I agree that the book seemed a bit creepy, being that it's written from the perspective of the dead. The beginning chapters seemed to lead to no where. Several chapters into the book, the pace picked up but Alice Sebold lost me with a scene on spiritual possession. The ending presented no sense of closure. As the reader, you are left asking, is that it??? It ends there??? What a complete utter disappointment!"
1,hated this book,"It is depressing. and the last 3rd of the book is utterly ridiculous. Ugh, don't bother reading this, not worth the time."
1,Boring,"Because I let myself be convinced by so much publicity about this book I bought it (they even made a program in NPR). Don't make my mistake. Maybe because my favorite books are historical fiction with good storylines that keeps you glued to the pages, I found this book really boooring. It was difficult to keep reading it because I could not care less about the characters. Its like a ""7th heaven"" tragedy mixed with the ""The Wonder Years"" (do you remember the series with Fred Savage?). I read 2/3 of the book and I was not sure I was going to finish it; I finished it so I could write this review and warn other people about it. I did not even like the narrative, too simplistic. I won't recommend it unless you are a suburban mom that can identify her family with the one portrayed by the book, then you might like it."
1,What a waste of time,"Thank goodness for libraries. I was able to checkout a free copy and not spend my hard earned money on this. The visions of heaven were actually disturbing to me. I'd hate to think that once I get there I still have the human characteristic of worry, pettiness, regret, longing and unhappiness.By the way, she spent quite a bit of time interacting with her high school love, why didn't she instead find a way to stop George Harvey or at least help those on earth find her remains.I thought the main character was selfish and self adsorbed.If you MUST ready this book and its not a must, go get it at library instead."
2,Boring!,"I think the reason this book got such press is the shock factor of the first chapter, the grafic rape and murder of 14 year old Susie Salmon. To be honest thats where the story ended for me, nothing else happened... The rest of the book didnt hold my attension it was an effort just to finish it.Ive also seen the movie, thats why ive given the book a 2 star, the movie was even worse."
5,Genius,I loved this book. Me and my friends have passed this around work and everyone there loves it. I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves novels. Also I would like to recommend another book that has inspired me recently--Dreams: Gateway to the True Self is what it is called.
2,"Great premise, great beginning, then it just dies","After seeing the movie review, I was more than excited to read this book that I was positive would become a new favorite. Wrong. The beginning was great, it caught my attention, and I wanted to see what happened. The climax though occurred in the *middle* of the book. With nowhere to go from there, the author just drug out the story, filling it with pointless trivia about the victim's family and friends. I kept going though, wanting to know how it ended. Then I got to the end and had to ask myself - what was this author thinking!If you're looking for a murder mystery as told by the victim, this unfortunately is not your book. If you're looking to read about the mundane lives of a family and their friends that you don't particularly care about, happy reading!"
2,"Good story line, but not worth reading","The first half was interesting so even when it started to drag in the middle I kept with it thinking it was going to pick up again. It never did.**spoiler alert******************Not only was the second half of the book tough, but how she ""takes care"" of the bad guy made me feel cheated. Part of sticking with the book was about finding out what happened to him. I couldn't believe I read the entire book. It was so frustrating to drag myself through whole thing, that the author had just barely strung me along and wasted my time. I promised myself to not read another release by Alice Sebold (unless she does some major growth as a writer). This may sound like a contradiction, but it could be a good movie, because the overall story line is good."
2,The definition of Maudlin,"Corny and effusively sentimental, with a too-tidy ending that brings justice to all. I didn't connect to any of the characters because they were all entirely unreal in a stereotyped way, much like a 1950's sitcom. The one positive is that I felt compelled to finish it. This book is best suited for the person in your life that collects angel knick-knacks and needs to feel like ""in the end, all the poor suffering children will have their own gazebo on a cloud!"""
1,Most Depressing Book EVER!,"Like many others, i was so incredibly intrigued by the opening sentences. I read so many raving reviews so i just had to read this book. As I read the book I became more and more depressed. I was hoping so badly that it would get better or that there woudl be some sort of resolution but there never was. It was horrible. Don't waste your time or your money."
4,Interesting book!,This is an odd and sad tale of a girl who dies. I thought some of it was strange but I really enjoyed reading it. The story line is terrific. What's odd is some of the spirituality and after life presented. I am so glad I read it though.
2,it was okay.,"I didn't really like it. After all the publicity it got, I was expecting.... more somehow. It started out wonderful, but it really dragged in the middle. There were times when it didn't seem like anything was happening, plot-wise."
3,Overrated,This is a bang-up short story that has been bloated to book length. The result is one part Stephen King one part Harlequin novel. She should have just published the first chapter and left it at that.
5,Affairs To Remember,"Why should you read this book? In my opinion, Alice Sebold's ""The Lovely Bones"" is one of the most uniquely presented and creatively written fiction stories to come out in many years. The only others in the same category, that I liked, are the ""Harry Potter"" books, in fiction, and, ""West Point: Character Leadership...Thomas Jefferson"", in creative nonfiction. If you would like an unusual experience, don't miss reading Ms. Sebold's great book, or the others I have mentioned, for that matter. They are all affairs to remember."
1,Macabre and tedious at the same time,"This is a story that indulges a taste for the horrific details of a loathsome crime, the capture, rape, murder and dismemberment of a young girl. The storyline is, on the surface, awful indeed, but the hype surrounding the book led me to believe that the novel rose above that to deliver some uplifting message. Acquaintances who had read the book said it was pretty good.Why?Can people be so insecure about their own mortality that they are willing to grasp at straws such as these for reassurance?This story just made me feel bad. If I could give it less than one star, I would."
1,A Disappointment of a Novel,"I too fell for the hype. So much has been mentioned over the past few months about this novel and I fell for it and bought it. As stated in previous reviews, after the first chapter or two, where the shock and horror of the experience of the murder and rape of a young teenage girl has you focused on the events as opposed to the writing, you find yourself surrounded by poorly developed characters, a non-sensical story-line and page after page of silliness. This novel doesn't know what it wants to be... a serious crime-solver novel, a teenage soap opera, a romance, a supernatural thriller... too bad."
3,Too Much Hype,"I was very eager to read 'The Lovely Bones' after hearing the critics label it a modern-classic. As another victim of hype, I was letdown. The angle of this book is its biggest redeeming quality. The narrator in the novel tells her story from heaven. The writing, not the most poetic, is good. And I was never, ever bored with the book--the pacing's good. But aside from the father, there really never was a character I truly cared about. A decent read, but nowhere near the area of modern-classic."
4,Very Good but not Great,"Alice Sebold has written an interesting and readable first novel with a very unusual view of life after death. Susie Salmon and her sister Lindsay are very memorable characters and her parents sympathetic. However, it was not the GREAT read the pre-release publicity led me to expect only a very good light read that made me think."
2,can't believe this was a best seller,"Very depressing book, or maybe just not my cup of tee. Young girl murdered (gruesome) and then watches herfamily from heaven. Would not recommend (sick mind of this writter!)Do not want to get depressed reading a book ~ not uplifting at all. Give me a break (best seller???) Very bad book."
2,Led Astray,"I stop reading books if I'm not grabbed within the first couple pages or at least within the first chapter. I was tricked with this book. I thought after downloading and devouring the preview of this book I'd stumbled across a winner, but after purchasing I was sorely disappointed.Let me sum it up for you. Girl is abducted and killed, family is forever altered and messed up, dead child has weird experiences on the other side. I like movies and books that take on a challenging and devastating topic, but this book lacked any redeeming quality. If you like to take a look into someones messed up life, and enjoy a beginning but no destination, you will love this book. Save yourself a miserable journey and find another way to depress yourself."
3,In and out,"This novel has some great moments and endeavors to be touching, but in the end there is a corniness that permeates this novel. For a girl who died at 14 her narratives are steeped with a wisdom of the ages that is out of place. The way the violence erupts from a kindly neighbor in this friendly town hits a high dramatic note early that is not sustained and I thought it would've been better if the killer were not known to the reader as she steers the investigation along, because it took a lot of the interest out of it for me."
2,characters can feel more than one emotion,"I've never written a review on-line before, but there has been so much hype about this book I finally gave in and bought it. It's a gutsy premise for a book, and , as many others have said, starts off strongly, but when Sebold tries to do the really difficult stuff - tangle and untangle the pain, anger and emotions in response to such a tragedy - she fails. Each character seems to have only one response - Dad is pitiful, Mom is detatched, little sis goes on to leave such a charmed and uneventful life it simply is not believable. I don't want to give anything away in the book, but when events happen that would make Mahatma Gandhi angry and all Dad does is weep you just lose interest. It is the writer's job to make a character complex, but whenever Sebold comes close to something,she pulls back and throws in another character, from the town or a roadside diner or school. It ends up being a very superficial treatment of a very powerful subject."
5,Awesome Book!,Excellent book. Holds a very different story line that grabs you from the first page. Wonderful read that brings tears to your eyes and a smile to your face.
3,Hmmmm.,"Opinions seem to vary on this book - all the way from one star to five. I'm in the middle. The Lovely Bones held my attention long enough for me to finish it. The writing, in places is weak, but then the person telling the story is a 14 year old and the text reads like a 14 year old might speak. I thought the viewpoint (that of a young girl in heaven) of the main character was different and interesting. Descriptions of heaven were not too clear nor appealing, but how many readers know what heaven is really like? I was confused by the mother's reaction to everything, but admired the father. The little brother, Buckley, is likable, the sister, Lindsey, is not. The likability of this book - more than most - seems to depend on the reader's taste."
2,Amazing Book but Then .....,"I'd waited months to read this book (before I'd finally gotten around to getting a copy of it) and dove right in after receiving it. My honest opinion? The first 21 chapters are AMAZING. They are filled with humor, sadness, and a 14-year old's perspective that really brought back some memories of my own (I was a child of the 70s also). However, around the 20th chapter or so, the author seemed to lose direction and the book went from being a sweet story to something resemblimg ""Tales From The Crypt"" or ""The Twighlight Zone."" It was a huge let down after reading all of those first chapters that were so beautifully written! I'm not sure what happened in the writing process to make the tone change so dramatically in the end but I'm glad I read it since everyone is talking about it. I wouldn't recommend it to others because of those last few chapters."
2,Not a strong story,"This book was really interesting in the beggining but it totally fell apart and dragged on in the middle. The ending straight up sucked. It seemed like she just totally ran out of ideas. I don't know, I didn't like it at all. I thought this book was totally over rated."
3,The Lovely Bones...,"Every now and then, people at my job will leave books available for anyone to read, ""The Lovely Bones"" was one of them. I picked it up and started to read, every chance I had at work (lunch, after work), I went through the book. The story was tragic, sad, mournful. But, it was also funny and uplifting. I felt that it was well written and painted the mental pictures very well. Get a copy at a good price and decide for yourself! Three stars! P.S., when I finished the book, I put it back for someone else to read/enjoy!! It is a good book!!"
3,"Decent book, worth the read","I would give it 3 1/2 stars if that were an option. This was a good read. Creative story and pulls the heart strings. But the subject is so disturbing, I often asked myself if I really wanted to continue reading this book. I disliked some of the characters, especially the mother. Overall it was worth the time, but it was ultimately pretty forgettable."
2,Beginning was great!,"When I first started the book I was hooked. Not just because of what was happening to Susie Salmon but all in all it was very touching, and moving. But towards the middle and the end of the book I must say I was struggling to finish. I even put it up for a few weeks and then went back to finish it up. Good but not all the hype that it has been given."
5,An Amazing Story..A must read!!,"This well crafted novel about a murdered girl who watches the life she was once in go on without her is an amazingly intriguing and touching story, with passion, truth and the unimaginable. Alice Sebold captures her reader's interest in this breath taking story that will give you goosebumps, make you laugh, and want to know more. The ending is awesome, and unexpected.... This is a must read! Once you finish it, you will want to start it again, so pick up a copy of this book and read it NOW!!!"
3,"The Deep End of the Ocean, Revisited","""The Lovely Bones"" reminded me a lot of ""The Deep End of the Ocean."" If you liked one, you will surely like the other. I look forward to reading Ms. Sebold's next work.For what it is worth, I agree with the reviewer who considered the last part of the story a misstep. I would go farther and say I thought it was very disappointing. At the end of the chapter immediately preceding the ""misstep"", the reader is led to believe that something important is about to happen. I guess the ""misstep"" could be considered a dramatic development, but it cheapens the rest of Susie's story. Ms. Sebold could have gone in so many different directions. Why did she have to go in that one?Nonetheless, I recommend this book."
5,A Stunning & Beautiful Story,"I was completely blown away by this book. Sebold tells the story from the point of view of a dead girl, beginning with her murder, and ending 10 years later, as the protagonist views her family from heaven. The story is told in an extremely poignant fashion without becoming a tear-jerker or an overly emotional ""statement on the human existence.""The story itself, the plot, the characters, and the narrative style are portrayed very intelligently, though there is nothing pretentious about it.The scenic descriptions are sublime, and there is suspense involved, though this isn't in any way a mystery. The characters are slowly, but fully, developed, and the passage of time is shown with a light hand.I will read every book Sebold writes."
4,THE LOVELY BONES: A Novel by Alice Sebold,"This is a must read!Alice Sebold has the most vivid, wonderful,refreshing imagination i have felt in words in a long time.The Lovely"
4,Experiencing death through Susie's eyes is incredible.,A powerful story rich with experiencing the memory of living and dying. A brutal rape and murder takes you on an intense journey.
4,A Gripping Read,I really enjoyed this book. You feel as if you are in heaven with Susie looking down on earth. You want to help her family and friends find the killer. It is a great depiction of how each person handle's death in a different way. I enjoyed the author's take on heaven. I thought it was quite original. Very good.
2,Unlovely Plot,"My mother-in-law gave me this book to me to read, which was given to her by her older son, my brother-in-law. It was not a topic to her liking, but she thought I might enjoy it. Like many readers, I found the very first pages engrossing, but the prose got forced,the sentimentality too much, and the switching of bodies for the sake of some sort of happy ending of sexual union did it for me. HUH? The potential strength of the book is that it presents a wonderful opportunity for the kind of internal dialogue warranted by the unique situation of the narrator--she is in heaven and now sees everything from up there. But by allowing her to have this extremely physical experience, the author squanders this wonderful opportunity, so the strength of the book becomes its weakness. I suppose the prose can be captivating since it has the aura of an omniscient, stream-of-consciousness narrator, but then again, there are better stream-of-consciousness books."
3,Something was missing.,"I enjoyed the book. It was pretty hard to put it down and I finished it in 2 days. The first few chapters were excellent but as the book progressed, I was screaming for justice for Susie. Were they ever gonna find her body, and catch the murderer? ... Her body was never fully recovered, I felt something was missing. She came back to earth and did what... She could have done more than that. The author did not move me as much as I thought this book would. I guess in the end her true objective was to see how the family would cope and what they would do with their lives.It was worth my money...but I thought it would do more."
4,Good reading,"I purchased this book because there was so much buzz about it, however, to me the ending of a book is important. The author must disagree with me. Although this book is a real page turner and very well written with a very interesting point of view, it leaves you at the end wondering what happens??? I can't stand that! Plus, with the book being a murder mystery, you would think that the author would give us more closure. I would recommed this book, however-it's one you don't want to put down but one that will let you down in the end."
5,An incredible story...,"From the eyes of a child murdered - it is both saddening and at the same time inspiring. The story of a girl watching what happens on earth after she is murdered, it was hard to put down. With 3 kids I still HAD to finish it and did in 4 days. It is that hard to stop reading. I recomend it to anyone who has a heart but also likes the suspense of mystery also."
3,A Tender Look Into A Horrifying Tragedy,"When child murder occurs, tenderness is supplanted with a myriad of horrifying human feelings and responses. How might one ever again get to tenderness unless through the eyes of the child victim. Only she may grant the wish of all others to feel sweet, vulnerable and whole again. No other perspective is possible in a pure form. I thank the author for at least an pixel of space to choose."
2,"Strong beginning, weak finish.","This book had so much potential. I was racing through it, tissue in hand. Then suddenly I felt that one evening while watching ""Ghost"" Ms. Sebold's editor called and said he needed the book. She hurriedly finished leaving out all the depth of her early writing. Susie's ""return to Earth"" was totally unnecessary, almost insulting, to the wonderful character that had been developed. The mother's acceptance back into the family felt tacked on as did George Harvey's fate. In short, I don't understand the huge success of this book."
1,I don't see how anyone could like this,"By the time I got to the end of this book I was just flipping through the pages, skimming them for anything that seemed interesting. I had high hopes for this book, but I think, and I believe that any critical reader would agree, that there is no substance to this book. I dogear pages in books that contain some jewel of language that I think pertains to my life or has some insight on human nature. I didn't dogear a single page in this book. Don't buy it. If you must buy it, buy it used."
2,stomach turning,"Oprah would've loved this book. You've got your classic female victim: an innocent young girl. You have your tragedy: an ugly rape and murder scene. You have your female triumph: the victim goes to heaven. You've got your weak, evil or helpless males. And then you have a lot of garbage filling the rest of the pages. The family, which wasn't wrapped that tightly to begin with and we, along with our heroine get to watch. Ick. This is a slobbery, sentimental, poorly written triffle. It should have been called As the Stomach Turns."
4,Nice change of pace,"This is not typically the kind of book I read however I found it interesting having been written from the perspective of a 14 year old girl who had been murdered, watching down on earth from her heaven. Her family and friends trying to pick up the pieces and the police trying to find her murderer. Definitely a nice change of pace and one I would recommend to my friends."
3,Wait for the movie,"I found this book a bit disappointing. It definitely did not live up to the hype. Do yourself a favor and wait for the movie. Its one of the rare instances where the movie will be better then the book. It was a nice read though. The concept of the murdered girl's point of view from heaven was inventive and uplifting. However, I think the story falls off toward the end and left me disappointed overall."
4,A different perspective,"This was a wonderful book to read. I couldn't put it down. I finished it in 4 nights. Just the way the story unfolds told in 1st person, but an already dead person. It was just compelling to learn of the ordeals the family and friends of a loved one had to deal w/ their death. I cried, I laughed and I panicked. It did get confusing at times because of all the jumping around from memory to memory."
1,I wish that I could of liked it,"I was really excited to start reading this book. It has received so much attention. It turned out to be a big disappointment for me. Maybe it was the reality of it. I am not sure. I don't need reality. I see it every day. I wish I could say something good about the book and I can't. I can't even call the book creative because I feel it was a rip-off of the movie ""What Dreams May Come"" that won an Academy Award back in 1998."
1,A HUGE disappointment,"The Lovely Bones was a huge disappointment and I am embarrassed to have fallen for the pre-release hype that led me to purchase it. The narrative is contrived; I groaned aloud at several passages. For example: ""Hers contained a desire beyond sweetness and attention, it fed a longing, beginning to flower green and yellow into a crocuslike lust, the soft petals opening into her awkward adolescence."" Enough said."
5,Bible Thumpers,"Dontcha just love it when Bible Thumpers weigh in with their 'oh so mighty opinions'? It's a work of fiction, not a book on Theology. Lighten up and go open the Bible if you want that kind of story."
1,Maudlin to the max,Yikes- this was recommended reading for my daughter entering her senior year .... this is written as well as any novel picked off the paper back rack at the airport- NOT an example of intelligent writing one hopes would be recommended for students. The story is disturbing but it is written for pre-teenagers in terms of the language used - and I'd yank it away from anyone under the age of 16!SO DISAPPOINTED!
3,Powerful beginning falls flat,"This book didn't live up to my high expectations. I admire the author greatly for writing it, I have never read a book quite like it, I really did feel mired down in the family's great unhappiness. However the characters didn't really come alive for me. The book is part mystery, part fantasy, part fly on the wall drama of a family falling apart. I felt very compelled to read on for the first third of the book but after that I felt that the story started to unravel somewhat. I would recommend it to people who have read a lot of books and want to read something quite original."
2,Left me feeling bad.,Not as well-written as I had hoped...I had to read some sentences several times to make sense of them. Found it hard to become engaged by the characters and care about what happened to them. Many instances of dissonance and downright dichotomy in the story.
2,More hype than substance,"I'd read so many high-octane reviews of Lovely Bones that I began it with great hope and anticipation. Unfortunately, I ended it with a whimper. The engaging premise was ripe fruit left to die on the vine. The book moved slowly and I never felt a great deal of empathy for the characters, except perhaps the father. There was too much nuance; too much literary stylishness; too little that touched my heart or challenged my mind. And I was really turned off by the body-borrowing that went on late in the book. Not exactly sorry I read it, but ....hmmmm... well, maybe I am."
2,Could have been better,There was a lot of rambling and jumping from one story line to the next. The author never stayed on subject and I felt like the story was incomplete. It took me long time to read it and I felt myself skipping over pages. It was very cliche too.Plot of book was creative but not unique.
5,Heaven and Earth?,"I was first drawn to read this book because of a review that appeared in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The subject matter piqued my curiousity. And the author's handling of the subject matter gripped me and I found myself thinking about the book while I was at work and I couldn't wait 'til I got home so that I could continue reading. I highly recommend it. It is an easy read, but that does not mean that the book is of light material. It is heavy and deals with a lot of emotions and a lot of issues that come up after a tragedy such as this - the rape and murder of a children - and the apparent injustice that so often prevails. Whether one believes in a life hereafter or not, I think this book sets one to thinking...."
3,Somewhat Disturbing,"This book has made me look at my child rearing responsibilities in a whole new light. I am constantly reminding my children to be cautious of everyone, even neighbors and acquaintances. Also disturbing to me was the idea that in this little girl's heaven, she still worried and had anxieties she had when living."
3,It's a peice of summer fluff,"Lighten up! This is a good story, fun to read and easy to put down. I finished it in 3 hours with a cup of tea and a scone. If you want to get into theological arguments over a summer book, I think its a big waste of time. It is pretty well written and the characters are good enough that I cried a couple times.However, there was material here for a longer book with more plotting and deeper characterization - the plot is pretty linear. I also wished that there had been a bit more justice in this book, but then I am a long time reader of murder mysteries...so I kept expecting the detective to figure something out.Lots of fun and should be read for fun. The ending was a bit much and I would have preferred for the protaganist to be more 'hands off'. If I had a second chance on earth, I don't think I would have done what she did, but hey...its a summer novel!"
4,So far a good read.,"Much better than the movie, a quick and enjoyable read for those looking for a good book to tote to work. I bought a used copy and for what I paid for it ($4) I couldn't have been disappointed."
2,The Lovely Bones,Just didn't care for the way this novel was written. Saw the movie and thought it was good although it didn't follow the book and develop the characters the way they are developed in teh book.
2,Love it or hate it!,"This book has circulated Juneau, Alaska this past year, and I read it on the recommendation of a friend who couldn't put it down. Me? I had a very difficult time wading through it! I just couldn't get into it . . . didn't like the story line . . . and didn't like the concepts the book was dealing with. After talking with several people who read it, we've learned it's one of those books a person either loves or hates."
1,very disappointing,"After all the hype, I expected more. I kept plugging away, but could not get interested and finally gave up, something I rarely do."
1,A ton of reading for nothing,"I finished the book yesterday much anticipating it to hit its stride and become interesting. The book felt like it peaked in the first chapter and I spend the rest of it waiting and hoping for a revenge that never comes. I would only reccomend this to people wanting to imagine what life would be like for your family and community if you were murdered, but it is certainly not a page turner."
2,Not worth 5 bucks,Not near as good as hyped up to be. I was not impressed with the authors style. Prefer James Patterson anyday.
1,Very Disappointed,"This book was not at all what I expected. I was left sad and frustrated after reading it. I was only able to finish it by telling myself that the murderer would be caught or that her body would be discovered. Unfortunately, even though the writer teased the reader with the possibility of both, neither happened. The reader, through the eyes of the poor dead girl, helplessly watched as the family fell apart. I felt so sorry for her father and just as strongly despised her mother. As for the writing, the sentence structure was so strange that I spent half my time re-reading. Someone asked me if it was because it was being told by a teenager. I could allow for that, except that the school systems back in the 70's still expected students to use proper grammar. Overall a real disappointment that I would not recommend to anyone. I had planned to see the movie, but after reading the book, I won't bother."
4,Family frustration on a lost of a child.,"Alice Sebold describes in this novel what she thinks heaven and hell are at the eyes of a murdered little girl.And how she helps give confort to a family who has been affected by blood and evil.It helps us see the reality in which we live in.We must be aware of the people who surround us so no one we love becomes a picture on our milk carton as the 9 year old girl from lonely bones.Great book,very sad story of today's reality."
4,"Unique, engaging","It seems this book strikes a strong cord with people--they either love it or hate it. The progtagonist, Susie, is a richly dimensional character for whom we come to know and love. Susie, as such, tells her story from an omniscient perspective. I found it interesting that sometimes I felt as if I were in the room with the other characters of the novel and at other times, looking above, as Susie herself. If you like novels focused on character development and are willing the forays into unchartered literary ground then this may be a book for you!"
3,Lovely and Haunting,This book was lovely and haunting. It details a child's journey from life to afterlife while she watches the effects of her murder on the people that she loves. It gives people a new way of thinking about letting go of those that we have lost.I give this one 3 stars because of the ending. After reading some of the horrors of the book I was disappointed by the ending (I don't want to give too many away here). Worth a read.
5,"Great, but depressing","This book was by far the most depressing thing I have ever read in my life. While the characters developed well throughout the story, and the plot development kept me interested, I admit I had to put it down from time to time. This was not a book to sit through in one read. The subject matter was obviously going to be tough, but I had no clue it would make me feel so sad!! So while I HIGHLY reccomend the read, I also highly reccomend a box of tissues and some Prozac to go with it."
4,The ending is well worth it,"Although this book sometimes reads like pulling teeth, I think the end was marvelous. Although ""justice is not served"" in the traditional sense, it reiterates what the book is telling the reader all along - not everything in life is about fairness. Pick this book up and stick with it, even through the dull or slow parts."
2,Therapy For the Author - Unpleasant For the Reader,"If you want to cry and like seeing other people in anguish and pain, this is a book for you. I'm not sure why this is such a popular book? A wrenching murder and then the painful aftermath are studied in great detail. This isn't an experience I would wish for anyone, so why do we need to read about it? I guess I was expecting something more based on the book's popularity. Probably it's my fault. High expectations often create a difficult hurdle for an author to overcome. I hope others found some solace or value in this. It was just a difficult downer for me."
2,Decent...but that's all,"I am in agreement with another reviewer who is confused by all the raves that this mediocre book is inviting. I didn't think it was so great. Perhaps this is due to its following Tartt's The Secret History in my reading order, but this was only second-rate."
3,Good Read but.................,"The beginning of the book was exceptional, however, her transition through heaven was not really covered enough, although the pain felt by the family was very real, even that was not expanded upon as I thought it would be. Her father and sister seem to me the only real characters. The mother's actions became totally unexplained by the author, in other words not in depth enough to understand her actions within her own mind."
3,The Lovely Bones,"This book was quite interesting at the beginning and mostly throughout the book, but the end lacked a strong resolution for the main character's family. Overall, a very good book."
2,Waste of trees,"The book started strong. But, after dragging the story for years out and all the unnecessary stuff like the mother's ""actions"", the grandmother appearing from nowhere, it became a total bore. It just was a waste of trees. This book could have been written in maybe 150 pages (at the most)."
1,NOT well written,"I really looked forward to reading this book, seeing as how it has been on the bestseller list for ages. What a HUGE disappointment! While I found the first half of the book rather engrossing, mid-way thru it literally just fell apart. It made me think that the writer simply ran out of ideas and was searching for a way to end the book. I almost didn't even finish it, because I totally lost interest. Don't waste your money or time on this book."
2,Hard to Finish,"The only reason why I read this book from cover to cover is because I hate not finishing things I start. It took me a total of about three whole agonizing months to finally get to the end, and I only succeeded because I was on a flight to Jamaica. One more month, and I probably would have forgotten about it. Bookstores need to take this book of their bestseller bookshelves and quit teasing readers into thinking that it is a good read--it was terrible.The only reason I gave this book two stars was because the beginning hooked me, but everything past that had nothing to do with what hooked me in the first place.If you like stories with shallow plots or don't mind it when the antagonist gets away, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, steer clear and don't waste your precious time like I did."
2,What's so good about it?,I have read about a third of this book and have decided to stop. I honestly don't know what the fuss is about. It started okay and is now downright boring. Save your time and money.
2,Disappointing,"After reading all the hype of this book, I was very excited to dive into something worthwhile. After getting through 1/2 of the book, I was extremely disappointed and bored. I just had to finish the book since I already made it that far plus I was curious to see how all the loose ends would be resolved. Needless to say I was not satisfied with how everything ended. The author ended everything on a positive note. Yet I didn't feel justice was served and the murderer got away easy, compared to what Susie went through on Earth and goes through in Heaven. If you are looking for a exciting read and feel good read, this isn't the book for you."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I love mysteries and thrillers of all kinds, and dramatic fiction that is unique and challenging. This book didn't fit into any of these catagories for me. I can't deny its popularity, but I can say it wasn't my cup of tea.I was glad when I finished it."
2,"Too Much Hype, Not Enough Substance","I was not impressed with this incredibly promoted, overly hyped novel. The subject matter is of course, controversial and I felt it could have been handled alot better. The narrative was awkward in places and was basically 8th grade reading level. Not impressed."
3,Fantasy for those who don't usually read fantasy,"A girl dies and is taken to a magical world where she learns to deal with her Earth-bound life. Although a novel concept for a mainstream book, a person who reads fantasy may find road all too well travelled.For that reason and others, I did not find this book as remarkable as the rest of the world seems to have found it."
2,This book was a disappointment...,"While this book was entertaining through the first half, I found that the author seemed to lose sight of where the book was going, how it was going to end, and why it was even written. I was pulled into the story immediately with the crime that the story revolves around. Then, about halfway through the novel I lost interest as nothing was really happening. The ending, which I struggled to get through, was silly and disappointing. I pushed through to the last pages hoping the ending would at least be a bang, but unfortunately it was a barely a whimper. With all the incredible fiction out there, I would not recommend this novel."
3,Overrated,I got suckered into the hype on this one. It's an okay read. I thought the premise extremely interesting--a girl in heaven as the narrator looking down on earth. The part where the dead-girl-in-heaven inhabits another girl's earth body and seduces her high school crush was a little over the top for me. Susie's heaven sounds to me like a flat emotionless place. I hope the other side is not like this at all!
2,Big disappointment,The reason I bought this is because of a review I heard on NPR stating this was one of the year's best novels. It makes me rethink my annual donation to public radio. It is easy reading and is written from a unique perspective but has an absurd endinging and underdeveloped characters. You should feel sorry for the mother in the story bc she has lost her child instead I thought she should have stayed in her minimum wage job in Napa after deserting her family. The ending was ridiculous with the Susie's reinactment of Ghost where Demi Moore invades Whoopie Goldberg's body. Then the piece de resistance is when the murderer is killed by the icicle. Give me a break. I have never been so interested in selling something on eBay.
2,"""Heaven"" help this culture","This and other ""book group"" books like The Secret Life of Bees, Bee Season, The Corrections, etc. typify the decline of American culture. Though I suppose that in the past, the ""popular"" books were not the ones that survived the test of time, much as, I'm certain, these won't, either.The Lovely Bones was a decent read, though given the subject matter, oddly devoid of emotion. There are some aspects that are disturbing, which is okay, but others that are downright silly. But when I got to the scene where Suzie enters her friend's body so she can have sex with Ray, I just lost it. This is SOOOO Hollywood and such a cheap trick. Well, at least I am forewarned, not to see the movie version, which I'm sure will play up this totally stupid scene. This ruined the book for me."
2,Interesting plot but lacked character...,When I first got the book and started to read it i thought it was interesting to have the perspective of grief told from the point of view of the person who is dead.. however i think the story would have been better if she had not fell from heaven.. it just confuses and messes up the plot of what is going on with her family on earth and her adjusting to life in heaven..
1,Disappointing,"This is a ""chick"" book. It is not intended for guys who are linear thinkers and expect a story to unfold in an orderly and logical fashion. The beginning starts of well enough, but after that the author gives us snapshots or ""postcards"" of events unfolding on earth after Susie dies. It is not cohesive. What the author does is paint some excellent word pictures of single events occurring in the book, but the actual story is disjointed and dissatisfying. The killer appears to get away with the murder. What happens to her remains on earth is dissatisfying. There are just too many questions left open. If you care more about the emotional impact her Susie's death on her family and less about the solving and answering of her death, you may like it more than I did."
2,Stupid ending,"When I read the first part of this book, I was hooked. I even got a couple of friends to start reading it and was recommending it to everyone. But, halfway through the book, I felt the author losing focus and direction. The George Harvey character deserved more than 3 lines to describe what happens to him. I found the interaction between Ruth (as Susie) and Ray a little farfetched, even given the spiritual tones of the book. Disappointing and anticlimactic..."
2,A sketchbook rather than a painting,"Unsatisfying and manipulative. Learning this was a debut effort explains a lot.I didn't feel the narrative voice was convincingly close enough to a 14 year old's and I suppose the omniscient parts about what her mother/father/siblings/friends are feeling can be ascribed to the heaven vantage point.I found myself asking ""what was the author intending?"" more than I should, especially considering with a really compelling story, one forgets about the writer's existence entirely. The plot seemed to be advanced mainly through a desire for justice rather than interest in individual characters and the ending was just too Touched by Angel for my taste.There are so many better authors who can show rather than tell.I wonder if this book is so popular because of the subject matter, and to find fault with it is somehow and indictment of personal grief?"
2,The most over-hyped book of the summer.,"Alice Sebold writes beautifully. Also one saving grace in this book is the delightful grandmother who pops up from time to time. That character alone convinced me that Sebold really does have talent and may be capable of writing a decent novel, some day. Other than that--ugh. What an awful book. I can't believe I read an entire novel about a little raped/murdered girl who watches her family from ""heaven."" And then when she briefly body-snatches her old friend and hangs out with her old boyfriend for a few hours. Good lord! Like another reviewer on this page, I groaned out loud several times, too. The full-page ad in the New York Times has Anna Quindlan urging, ""If you read only one book this summer, read Lovely Bones."" So let me urge you--PLEASE. If you read only one book this summer, make it something decent--NOT THIS. Read Rohinton Mistry or Andrew Miller or Tessa Hadley or ""Spies"" by Michael Frayn."
2,Poor organization,"I haven't finished the book. It is quite depressing, but on a deeper level, I think that the book just doesn't seem realistic to me at all. I can't grasp anything the book was talking about and I just want to finish the book quickly out of irritation rather than because it was fun."
3,The Lovely Bones,"This was just an okay book for me. It revealed who the murderer was as soon as it happened, and never really got deeply into proving it. The whole story was told by the dead girl watching the relationships of her family from her heaven. It lacked excitement."
2,Lovely Bones,"It was a struggle to get through this book as it's very disturbing and dangerously depicts dying and heaven in a way that is very misleading. If one believes in heaven, then by default, onewould believe in God, and also the Bible. For people who are confused or seeking answers about their creation, dying and heaven, she has dangerously implied heaven and dying as something other than whatit is.I understand that this is a work of fiction, but nothing would lead a reader to believe that this is a work of science-fiction. Some readers may be okay with the rape and dismemberment of a young girl, as for me, it's an unfortunate reality for few and the rest of us should not deem it entertainment. I'm giving two stars because it does portray a good account of what effects a loss such as Susie's might have on her family and even people she hardly knew, such as Ruth."
3,Not as good as it could have been,I was a little disappointed in the book. It's a great story...about a girl (Susie) who watches her family and friends from above trying to cope with her murder (and trying to deal with it herself)...but I had a hard time getting into the characters. They were a bit dull to me (except maybe for the Grandmother) The description of Susie's heaven was rather boring as well. I think Sebold could have made this a little more interesting. I also wanted to know more of what was going on in the head of the murderer...but we didn't get to spend much time there either. The story itself was enough to keep me interested...and the ending was the best part (to me.)
3,Not worth all the hype,"I was SO excited to read this book, the concept sounded so amazing to me. But I must admit, once I had the book and began reading, it was not as I pictured at all. I struggled to complete the book which was not what I expected at all.The characters seemed unreal to me and although the author tried to get you in ""their shoes,"" I just couldn't ""feel"" for them, like I wish I had been able too.I'd say its worth the read just for the concept, but the whole time you spend thinking; ""I could have wrote this so much better."""
2,Wouldn't read it again...,"The author's writing in this book is very well done. She describes things very very well.BUT....the ending was a disappointment. It was missing something, in my opinion."
2,"Unique, yet somehow average","I completely agree that this is not a ""feel good"" book, and I disagree that this represents a typical teenager. My best friend died when I was thirteen and I did not relate to any of the situations that took place in the book. This book seems as a complete misrepresentation of youth and death. The supernatural part of the book was original, yet completely dark and depressing. I would not recommend this book."
3,Definitely not for gift giving,"I was profoundly depressed and disturbed by this book from beginning to end. It definitely is not a ""feel good"" nor gift type book. The author's concept of Heaven I also found a little strange; however, I gave it 3 stars for originality and uniqueness, but it is not a book I recommend to my reading friends."
2,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I bought this book based on reviews from friends and from magazine reviews that all said it was great. I liked the general idea of the story, that Susie is murdered and looks on from heaven, but found the rest of the story to be forced. That Ray still lusts for Susie after one kiss when they are 13 is unrealistic. I would have liked for there to be more about what Susie's heaven was like and to have understood more about the emotions that the mom went through.Overall, this book ws a big disappointement. I'm afraid that everyone is reading it and making it more popular based off of hype rather than real quality."
5,great book,"this was a very good book, i could not put it down! although it was a little disgusting in details i thouroughly enjoyed it. i have never experienced such a moving and erie feeling in my life. Thank you Alise Sebold for writing this book."
1,everybody owes somebody sometime,"This book has a gimmick (a spy in heaven) -- so does Dave Eggers's book, and so does Atonement. Those gimmicks work, but this gimmick becomes very very tiresome very very soon. Even so, I'd stick with it if the writing were good. It's precious, and not for mature readers. I keep on, thinking, surely, any moment... but no. What I'll remember from this is that even fabulous writers like Jonathan Franzen have publicists and editors who can coerce him into writing a blurb. That's how the system works. Read Three Junes by Julia Glass instead."
2,"good advice for girls, but not literature","This is a very disappointing book. The disappointment, for me, came from the fact that the subject so important and touching, as the bestial murder of a child and grief of the family, should be presented in equally moving manner. Even if the narrator is the child victim, which, obviously, necessitates some simplifications of the prose. Instead, Sebold's novel is formally conventional, very boring and predictable. I can understand its being a recommended reading for schoolchildren, because it can be a warning and fulfills the educational purposes, maybe getting to the adolescent child better than pamphlets and science, but if you are not a teenager and/or are looking for something else that a warning in a book, this would be a waste of time."
1,"Not worth reading, not worth a penny","There is nothing inspiring, nothing learned from reading this book. The book does not make sense and it is very hard to read. It seems that Susie never actually died, she never left earth. In buying this book, I thougth there was a chance to learn something from the heaven perspective but the author was just to earthly, into the emotions and the sex ...I was very, very disappointed. I am surprised that other readers gave this book even two stars."
3,So-So,This book was alright. I read it while traveling on business to pass the flying time. It was entertaining to say the most. I regret spending the money on the hardback. I would recomend buying it when the paperback comes out or get it from the library. The most interesting part is that the young girl is teling the story from heaven. Not the best book but not the worst either.
1,not sure,I have heard this is an excellant book... I wouldn't know due to the seller taking my money and not sending me my book. NOR have they bothered to contact me to return my money or let me know where the book I purchased is. I will no longer use the used book sellers.
2,Ending kills a potentially great book...,"You would hope this book could fulfill some of the hype, but of course it does not. Actually very entertaining for most of the book, but the ending abolutely destroys it in my opinion. I began reading it knowing there was a film already being made. Not sure how they will pull some of it off with much of the narrative being told from the first-person, but it may give them the opportunity to change some things, hopefully the ending....I guess it's worth the read but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Disappointing,"When I saw an interview with author Alice Sebold on the Today show about a month ago, I felt compelled to read this book. I liked the author and found a familiarity in her personality, as if she could be one of my friends. Unfortunately, I thought the book was extremely depressing and did not look forward to my nightly sessions of reading after a long day at the office. It starts with the detailed description of the rape and murder of a sweet 14 year old girl. When the book started out this way I thought it would get better but it continued on a depressing path describing her family's dissolution, her friends' wierd adolescent life ramblings and later, the supernatural invasion of their bodies. The best part of the book was the ending, where the subject (the murdered girl) addresses what the afterlife is like. That part was very descriptive and strangely uplifting after an arduous read. It was disappointing overall and I probably won't pick up another Alice Sebold novel."
1,A waste of time and money...,"I've never written a review before but I just had to jump in here with this one. I have never read a more boring book. Bestseller? Yes. Came highly recommended? Yes. But I can't imagine why.It starts out okay, but it never goes anywhere. You just keep wondering when SOMETHING is going to happen. I was at the end ofthe book before I realized that NOTHING more was going to happen.There was no great story here. No development of characters.Not even much of a plot. Everything you wanted to know about the book can be found out by reading the jacket and the inside cover.It goes nowhere...Save your money. But if you must read it, borrow a copy from someone. Or better yet...I'll give you mine!"
1,The Lovely Bones,This is the most trivial nothing that I have read all the way to the end! And the last couple of chapters proved to be the most disappointing feature of the whole book. I do not think that characters were well developed and the whole story disappointing.
2,Warning: Do not read if you want to feel good,"Despite what the reviews on the dust jacket and in many publications, this book is full of angst to the point that many readers may have to go on Prozac to finish. DO not believe the review that states the book has ""funny"" moments. This is a depressing read that even the supposed try at a ""happy"" ending does nothing to diminish. Maybe I am shallow, but I raced through this quickly to try and start reading someting that makes me feel something other than sad. It is a fairly well-written book, although you could probably skim through much of it and get the same effect in less time. Let the buyer beware in this case."
2,Is this supposed to be literature?,"I can't believe that there isn't one criticism of this book found in the editorial reviews. Maybe it is out of respect for the author and what she has survived that no one dared to write a negative review publicly. I (reluctantly) read this book for a book club, and I admit that the first 100 pages or so kept my attention. But there could have been so many themes here -life after death, faith, the mind of a serial killer, marriage issues, etc that were touched upon but ultimately left hanging. The book didn't seem to have any real message or coherence. Aside from the unusual perspective, I felt like I might as well have been reading a Judy Blume novel about adolescence."
3,Untouched By An Angel,"The much-heralded framing device of ""The Lovely Bones"" -- a narration by a 14-year-old murder victim -- would serve this ambitious novel better if the character of Susie wasn't oddly modeled on the wise, kind and omniscient angels so familiar from film and television. No teenaged girl was ever so knowing or brave, so stridently NOT a victim of violent crime. She is a combination of ghost, angel, avenger and poltergeist, and fills none of these roles credibly. Susie's preternatural insights and interventions from her highly personal heaven on high are, however, compelling reading. It is impossible to believe in this heroine, but it is also difficult to put the book down. Unfortunately, what creative power Ms. Sebold has is expended two-thirds of the way into the novel and it ends on a note so false and bathetic that it fairly screams ""Lifetime Movie of the Week."""
4,Good page-turner,"Excellent read. I couldn't put it down. The first half has moments of brilliance. As Sebold tries to tie the ends together, she falls into some sentimentality and cliche, but it remains a haunting story with an excellent premise."
3,Compelling,"This novel herald among the best of the best in NY times bestsellers; so it was no surprise that this book has to be read. Sebold is an amazing writer able to articulate feelings into words. I found myself tearing as the emotions flow along the pages. I like this book, but I don't love it, it did not deliver a great ending to the characters, but I suppose that is the beauty of it. The book is about a girl who was brutally killed; her killer at large; her soul linger among her love ones and witnessing the pain of her untimely death."
2,Not for me,"The fault with this book, and I feel kind of insensitive referring to it that way, is in the story. It was too vapid for me. Too unsettling in how dark and yet casual this murder, death and loss was. Several reviewers have mentioned humor; I found none. Maybe I wanted revenge too much. I wanted her character to pull some Hollywood stunt that would make her death make sense, but that wasn't the author's intent and, I never could figure any other reason for the story to be. It wasn't strong enough in its focus on loss or change and it did end up utilizing mysticism here and there, so why did the author not give it a purpose? It felt like a loosely wound ball of string with ends sticking out all over the place. I was anxious for it to be over and just felt sad, as if her life (and death) had not only been meaningless, but she had left no lasting effect on anyone elses life either. Just grief, guilt and confusion."
3,Disappointing Ending,"A good enough read, but the ending left (for me) much to be desired. I felt it was sort of a cop out, actually. Know exactly how I would have rewritten it. Still, good to read, and yes, it did grip your attention from the start. Although I wasn't exactly pleased with the ending, I hope there will be more from this author. She has the power and skill to write many a good book."
4,Makes The Implausible Seem Plausible..,"I am not a person who really believes in an afterlife. Also,I find most books about murdered children and young adults to be very explotive in nature,so I approached this book with some reservations. I was however,pleasantly suprized. I did wanted more descriptions of Susie's ""heaven"" as well as maybe a less elequent tone from an girl who describes herself as being an unexpectational student and not much into writing. It's like all of a sudden she becomes this kind of prophet as a result of her death. On the postive side,I really liked the charactors and I felt that it handled the subject matter well. Overall,a good and ""lovely"" story.."
4,This Book was Awesome,"""Lovely Bones"" is about a girl named Sausie who was raped and killed at the age of fourteen. The setting of the book is in heaven. She experiences many new feelings in heaven as she watches her family from above. She sees her family cope with her loss. Her mom leaves her family and Susie gets to see her mom as a person, not just a housewife. At the end of the book her family has grown older and she gets to spend a night on earth as a person and not as a soul. Susie ends up OK with being in heaven and finally moves on with her life as another soul.I thought the book is a story that is for serious readers, it can be overwhelming for a beginner. I think it was a sad book that teaches a lot about love within family and friends. This book was a great book. It makes me hope that that is how heaven is and it also makes me thankful for the people in my life whom I love. I hope the people that read this don?t just think of this as a sad book and think of it as a lesson on life."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I'm suprised others didn't like this book, as I found it (as cliched as it might sound) one I literally couldn't put down. In truth, I'm not sure whether I loved it or it was simply just compelling (which sounds redundant, I know) -- but I was riveted from the beginning. I didn't initially want to read this, as I'd heard so much hype I couldn't believe it, but was in a situation where I needed something to read and happened to have just been lent the book. Once I started, I didn't stop and read it one day. Did I love it? I'm really not sure, but I do know that it was incredibly gripping -- and would recommend it highly."
2,After reading the reviews I expected too much!,"I did not enjoy this book. It was quite shocking, and very tedious to read. Please read ""The Secret Life of Bees"" if you want a heartwarming book."
4,Of course I read this for a girl,At the time I must have only been 25-26 and I read this book to have an impressive discussion with a girl. But it actually ended up being a fascinating book and not at all chick lit-ty.
4,Good read,"Kind of confusing at times but a good book nonetheless, not as bone chilling as I'd hoped it to be"
2,Whatever,"I was intrigued by the first half of the book. The characters were likeable, but then it was like work to get through the rest. It hit a low plateau and just continued the same. I was so bored I never finished it. It lingered too long on unecessary stuff- kind of like the movie ""In The Bedroom"" with Sissy Spacek and Marissa Tomei where there were long periods of nothing happening to propel the story forward. I thought it was a big snore after the first 3/4ths."
2,Where's the Beef?,"Gentle Readers...this was not my type of book. I was expecting a gritty crime story and what I got was fluff. The basic idea of the book intrigued me; however, I found most of the characters boring and the author's writing style lacking. In defense of the book, I was the ONLY member of my book club who didn't like it -- the rest of them are still raving about it. It would probably make a good movie -- so I gave it 2 stars!"
2,If you like books that implode...,"What happened to this novel? It started off wonderfully and grabbed me from the first chapter (read it here at Amazon and see if you don't agree) - I can see why the publisher wanted it in print. But each chapter thereafter gets duller, more mundane, and - especially in the last 100 pages - downright inane.I don't doubt Ms. Sebold's talent as a writer, but it seems obvious she had no idea how to end the book - and still doesn't.One other note: you need to be able to handle metaphors that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Doesn't Little Brown have editors anymore? I can only hope whoever writes the screenplay (I assume this is going to film) will rewrite the second half of the story."
2,"Good Title, Boring Novel","So many people had talked about how wonderful this book was, so whimsical and wonderful and moving, I just had to get it. I was very let down. It's an interesting concept, but unfortunately, I didn't get into it at all. It was, sorry to say, boring. The writing was very stilted at times and the people were wooden. The heaven portrayed was depressing. I didn't really care what happened to any of the people- I just wanted SOMETHING to happen. The first half of the first chapter is the best part. The title is great, too bad the novel fails to deliver on the promise."
2,ho hum,"I was very disappointed - all the hype . . . best seller, good reviews . . . BORING. It worked better than a sleeping pill though, I'll give it that."
3,"Good story and unique narrator, but......","The story becomes weak when Susie is temporarily reincarnated in Ruth's body for a sexual rendez-vous with an old beau. Prior to this, it was made clear that the deceased in heaven can not influence people or events or intervene on earth, despite what may be their wish to do so. What was the point of this inconsistency in the plot?Susie tries to give the reader a feel for ""my heaven."" Some of her heavenly companions are described, but there is never any mention of God in heaven. A real deficiency in credibility, it seems to me."
1,What a Waste of Time,"This was the biggest waste of my time!! Absolutely one of the worst, disjointed, unbelievable stories I have read in many years. Don't expect to be able to follow any train of thought. There simply isn't any. Ms. Sebold evidently cannot write about anything without going off in multiple directions that have nothing to do with the original thought.She seems to be mesmerized by everything and anything. None of which has anything to do with the story.If the movie is anything like the book, I'll be walking out."
1,Seriously? Someone thought this would make a good movie?,"This book starts out interestingly enough, but fizzles into a tedious account of the boring goings-on of every minor character, with no resolution to speak of. The story left me feeling like I'd had cotton balls for dinner: still hungry, and confused about why I wasted so much time on something so purposeless.I can't give you my reason for disliking this book without spoiling the ending, but let's just say that if I were going to write a parody of The Lovely Bones, I would leave the last 100 pages completely blank."
4,Wonderful surprise,"This book was a great surprise for many reasons; I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. People should definitely read this book, especially if you've recently lost someone regardless of how they died. This book has helped give me a new view on what the ""afterlife"" might possibly be like and made my mother's death more bearable."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I have to say I was VERY disappointed in this book. I think it had excellent potential but I found that none of the characters ever really developed into people that I felt drawn to or even interested in. Also, I am soooo completely disappointed as to how the main issue in the book is resolved. I don't want to give anything away but I felt it was a total cop-out and if it had happened sooner in the book, I simply would have stopped reading. Since it was a few pages from the end I finished.This book certainly wasn't a waste of my time but I can't say I would recommend it to anyone."
2,A disappointment,"Doesn't live up to the hype at all. Sebold tries to tackle ideas that are substantial with weak writing. As a result, complicated themes are barely supported by immature writing."
2,What was the point.,"This book made no sense. It was not even a good murder mystery. If that is the writer's view of heaven, I feel sorry for her. She has nothing to look forward to except an eternity of what equates to real life television shows. Everyone suffers and the murderer is never brought to justice. Maybe that is what life is like for some, but who wants to read a fictional novel about it. I rate this right up there with Oprah's pick...House of Sand and Fog."
1,Boring and slow moving,"The beginning of the book is horrendous--a horrible attack on a 14 year old girl. The rest of the book plods on slowly as she watches the events of her family and friend's lives unfold. While there is a wonderful message--appreciate everything in life and appreciate the gift of living, the story just plods along slowly. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,From One Writer to Another -- Bravo!,"Alice Sebold's talent shines through in ""The Lovely Bones."" Susie's voice is powerful. Her version of heaven allows readers to visualize the journey of our souls in the after-life. The various characters in the story are people we can easily identify with. Each family member dealt with the tragedy differently, and the author did an excellent job detailing their emotions. My only gripe has to do with Susie's reunion with Ray. The technique seemed right out of the movie ""Ghost,"" with Susie in the role of Sam (Patrick Swayze).Bill Lee, author (""Chinese Playground"")"
5,moving towards resolution.....,"When I first saw Alice Sebold's name, I knew it rang a bell. ...Reading THE LOVELY BONES was NOT a too sweet experience for me- the possibility of death during my bad experience was obviously something Sebold has thought about extensively and the idea that THIS book came from working that possibilty through gives me great hope for the survival of the species. Bravo, Alice! I was moved, and unbelievably entertained,throughout the entire book."
4,The movie does NOT compare,"The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold has created a way to express what the life of a person who has passed might be like. Sebold's creativity lets you imagine things out of this world and feel the pain of losing a loved one. This story might not be suitable for girls that have not been explained the ""birds and the bees"" but defiantly will be a great reading for girls around the age of 13. The movie does NOT compare to the book, as though it has other views of the origin it still isn't the same, I recommend reading the book first."
1,What a sophomoric book!,"I was completely disappointed in this book that had received so much hype. I was reluctant to read it at first because in my job as a defense attorney, I deal with many child abuse cases and didn't relish reading a book that would deal so personally with the child's death. But, after reading so many rave reviews for the book, I gave in. Alice Sebold certainly had a clever idea for her story, and could have used it to explore real human emotions and the dynamics of the family, but instead she squandered her opportunity and ended up with a ridiculous, improbable and immature revere on retribution/fulfillment from the grave. Don't waste your time."
4,"Haunting, and wondefully written","When I first hear of the Lovely Bones then, the plot (young girl narrates her life and murder from heaven) seemed to just too hokey for me. But, after it was recommended to me a half dozen times, I decided to give it a go. I am really glad I did. Seabold walks a fine line between cheesy and brilliant here. Dead child narrators are not an easy trick, and at times the book is a little maudlin and contrived. But, the scene where the child narrates her own murder gave me chills. Definitely worth a look."
3,"Fabulous start, then falls flat","I became immediately engrossed in this novel. It was riveting. Unfortunately, somewhere just after the midpoint of the book, I felt the whole thing fell flat and I had to almost force myself to finish the book.The author's concept of heaven and the ""interaction"" between those that have passed and us mere mortals still on Earth is both interesting and hopeful. It has given me lots to think about. It could have been a great novel, if only the story hadn't languished after having me so inspired."
2,i reccomend this book for how NOT to write,"i had high hopes for this book since i had heard rumors that peter jackson was taking it on for his next film project. as i started to read this book, i really felt for the main character. the descriptions of place and time were well written, however the additional characters in the novel began to blend into each other. one minute, we think we are really feeling what this teenage girl wanted and loved, then suddenly, it becomes some cheesy harloquin romance novel. i was extremely disappointed in the last half of the book. several people have asked to borrow this book since i finished it, i loaned it to them with prejudice. and all of them came to the same conclusion. it was a good story and good premise but poorly handled. if peter jackson really is going to make a movie based on this book, i hope he fixes it!"
3,Introspective look at life...and death,"Due to the storyline, I find it somewhat difficult to review this book without giving anything away. I will say that this book proved to be a veritable dichotomy of unrelenting euphoria intertwined with an inexplicable cryptic moroseness. Difficult to explain, yet when you read it you will understand. Quite unlike any other book I've read in a while.The characterization by Alice Sebold is superb as she engenders a genuine empathy for our amiable protagonist Susie along with an equally ineluctable disdain for the antagonist Mr. Harvey. The entire book I found myself seeking justice for the tragic transgression committed - only to be somewhat let down at the anticlimactic conclusion. Overall, The Lovely Bones proves to be a unique page-turner that you can't put down. I liken it to a poor man's To Kill a Mockingbird - but that's still high praise, nonetheless."
3,The Lovely Bones- JH,"I was very excited to read this book because I had so many people tell me how good and different it was, but when I finally had the chance to read it myself, I was somewhat let down.The story is about a girl who was raped and killed and watches her family struggle through good times and bad while she is in heaven. The author was very creative while writing this story, because there were times I wanted to cry and then times where I was laughing hysterricaly. Suzie's character was very well developed and as the story went on I felt as if I knew her and her family.I did enjoy this book, but I had greater expectations. So many people told me different things about the book and when I finally had a chance to read it myself, I was dissappointed.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a funny yet heartfelt novel."
4,A Lovely Book,"Read this book a few years ago and recently reread it. An original, unformulaic story with an interesting premise and well developed characters. It can be difficult to convey all the emotions encountered in this story without being cliche, but Sebold pulls it off, especially in her realistic portrayal of the impact of Susie's murder on, and the gradual unravelling of her family, in the aftermath. The ""happy"" ending may not be realistic enough for some, but, hey, this is fiction. Overall, a book I would recommend to most anyone. It is timeless and has a permanent place on my bookshelf."
1,"""Is She 14 or 40???","After hearing/reading all the rave reviews of this novel, I decided to read the book. All I can say is ""Am I the only one who felt that all the hype must have been paid for by the publisher""? I will admit that the book began strongly, however it rapidly plunged downhill like an out of control rollercoaster. A couple of chapters could have been taken directly from the shooting script of ""Ghost"" and were completely out of character for a naive 14 year old.As for heavenly experiences and the meaning of our lives here on earth, both subjects were covered with more warmth and wisdom in Mitch Albom's ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"""
2,A Meandering Character Study,The Lovely Bones is really a series of character studies. The story kind of meanders along and there's not much resolution. Don't pick up this book thinking it's a mystery that will be solved. The focus of the story is how the protagonist's death changes her family.
2,I didn't like it at all!,"This book is so sad, so sad, that I could barely finish it. It had so many stories inside one that made no sense sometimes. I didn't like it and don't recommend it."
3,"Great start, then it sunk into cheese-town","The first 100 pages or so of this book had me hooked. What a fresh idea - narration from the grave by a young girl! But once it turned to the details of her sister growing up, it became tedious and quite cheesy."
4,"I really liked this book, thought it was a good read.",Thought the book was a good read but was a little disappointed with the ending. It felt like the writer had to end the book suddenly. I wanted more out of the ending. I wanted to have more details of the killer. I thought his demise was to...easy...nonchalant like. But all in all it was a good read. I recommend it for teens on up. I think I related to this book because I was a teen girl of the 70's.
5,A sad tale well written,"I had trouble with this book because of the nature of the story, but I kept right on reading. Well done."
3,"Too ""touched by an angel"" for me...","I have to say that I did read this the whole way through, and that alone says something good. How happy I was though to see that other readers shared my feelings that this book just started out so amazing, and then went south with the whole body inhabitation thing and all. The first 100 pages, I was thinking man 'o man I'm just loving this, and then something big time bad happened. How funny that it has done so well... I guess the TV show I mentioned above did pretty peachy too."
5,Not To Love a Novel More Than Life Itself,"I simply loved the way this book started out!! The first chapter was as awesome as the following ones. Of course the very start may give you a fright but it was very worth it to continue reading it. As soon as I was done reading all 42 of the sample pages online I had headed out on the same night to buy the book.... I continued to read for 2 days and I reached the end of a superior ending of a great book. I could tell that from reading from Susie's point of view, the author herself must've had a real life experience of a girl she had possibly known raped. The action in this book never drew my attention away from the plot even once. I could just say I loved it."
3,DECENT,"The Lovely Bones was pretty hyped this year - it even had a cameo on Family Guy which displayed a group of middle aged book club females grueling over Susie's mother's decision to leave. While Seabold's envisionment of heaven is somewhat intriguing her decision to incorporate a ""return to earth so she can bang her old crush through her lesbian friends body"" was a bit far-fetched. Ahhh, if only after we died we could zip back down to the planet and get laid. The most intriguing character in my humble opinion was Susie's father, his emotion in the book is the most prevalent and his scenes evoke sadness in the reader. The story started out strong and lost it's touch towards the end and often I would find myself wondering if I would even finish the story... I was getting bored. It had it's ups and downs; being that this was Sebold's freshman attempt I would venture to guess that she's on the right track, but doesn't quite have it yet."
1,disappointed,"I am struggling with this novel, which is surprising, because I was really looking forward to reading it. I don't even think the writing is very good. It is often confusing and awkward. I am having a hard time relating to any of the characters, as none of them seem real to me. I am only on page 150, so there is still hope, but at this point I think I am just being stubborn to continue with it. I forced myself to finish ""On Green Dolphin Street"" in November, and swore that was the last time I would do that for a book that is meant to be ""pleasure reading"". Some pleasure. For true pleasure reading, try Atonement. Sebold's novel seems to be an overhyped chore."
3,disappointing ending,"I also loved the first two thirds of the story; the ending was poor. Harvey's death was disappointing as well as Susie not being found, but perhaps alluded to being found in the future. Also, if Ruth really had sixth sense, why could't Susie help point her to her own body parts? Hey - if Susie could come on down for a quickie with Ray, why not fill him in? She could talk, after all. That made zero sense. And her charm bracelet being found in the end was unnecessary. After all, the person who found it had no idea whose it was thereby...not evidence as to what happened to Susie. I found the author leaving Susie's not being found disappointing, to say the least."
1,Astonishingly Overhyped,"I guess you either love or hate this book. When I see the stacks and stacks ... - one sure sign of the new author's rite of passage - I marvel at the marketing power of the book industry. The book is deceiving, with its theme, concept, and moral/ethical stance. And what a marvelous premise. As a single mom of an 11-yr-old girl, I think about this sort of thing constantly. Unfortunately, what starts out so promising fizzles like a cheap firework snake. The heaven scenes were laughable (why all the forced ""Heaven"" geography?), the family dynamics played out like a worn out soap opera, and the ending was so contrived it almost made me hurl. (And that bathtub scene - shamelessly stolen from ""Ghost."") Fortunately I only wasted an afternoon and a trip to the library (something told me not to spend any money on this one). Sebold: bag the fiction and stick to memoir."
3,Watch the Movie,"THE LOVELY BONES by Alice Sebold (3 stars) Watch the movie, forget the book. Yes, they are different, but the movie is better. The saying ""the book is always better than the movie"" is a crock."
2,An Ice Ending,"I won't go into the whole book, just the ending.The villain (is it possible to be more of a villain than someone who rapes and murders children and gets away with it?) receives his just desserts in the end -- now pay attention here -- when a large icicle hanging from a roof eave falls on his head.Yup. I ain't kiddin' ya."
4,A good read,I have read this book before. That is why I wanted it. It is a great story and that is why I gave it four stars but I was a bit surprised with the way the book looked. It was a plain blue cover I felt a bit of bait and switch by the picture advertising it. I think it was in a library prior to my purchasing it. It seemed a bit used and I thought it was supposed to be new. It did arrive on time thou and is a great story.
4,Beauty out of horror,"This book was a gift from my husband - one I would not have chosen because it centres around the murder of a child, every parent's most feared nightmare. This was indeed a gift, a gift of softly lyrical beauty, taking us through the fear and horror of Susie's dying to the peace and reconciliation of a uniquely imaginative conception of the after-life. I loved the interplay of Susie's choice of her own heaven, her close observation of her family and friends' journey through their grief and the ultimate resolution of the search for the murderer and his final punishment. This is a unique story which is both moving and elegantly crafted. I await Alice Sebold's next novel with eager anticipation."
3,fantasy or reality?,"I found it interesting that this book was written from a fantasy point of view and yet the author made sure to be realistic about how murderers get away. When Susie possessed Ruth's body that's where it all fell apart for me. First of all they both violated Ruth, Susie was still 14 technically but her boyfriend was a grown man, and how in the world was he able to get aroused under those circumstances? And the serial killer of children had just driven by, you'd think Susie might have mentioned that and that her body was in the sinkhole where they were standing. I liked the icicle but think it should have killed him while he was in prison. I gave this book 3 stars though because it was unique and intriguing."
3,"Good start, ran out of gas","The first two thirds of the book are great. The premise is very interesting, and it is carried off well in the beginning. But then it becomes a trudge to the end, and the end is disappointing.Still, it's a good read; just not quite satisying.The problem is a common one--great idea, good start, but inability to really carry it off. That's the main difference between popular books and literature--good literature is much more uniform from beginning to end."
5,Don't let the title scare you,"After losing my mom, I was searching everywhere for comfort, in every book imaginable. This was the last book I would've thought could provide a calming, but it did. It was nice to read another person's perspective of the afterlife. I recommend this book to everyone, especially those who have just experienced a loss. The death of child is horrendous, but the author did justice for my peace of mind."
3,Ruined it for me,I was so excited to read this book after all the good things I had heard about it. And I wasn't disappointed with Sebold's great story idea or her very real and likable Susie Salmon. I could even deal with the rather unconventional and seemingly God-less view of heaven - one view is as good as another. But the last bit of the book ruined it for me. I felt it cheapened the whole idea of humanity and presents a warped view of maturity and ultimate peace/happiness. I should have stopped reading sooner and I'd have been able to really give the book a glowing recommendation to my friends.
1,Disappointing,"I'm clearly a minority here, but this book was a waste of time and money. After a good first chapter, the story becomes more and more boring. I ended up skipping bits and pieces in the end... The writing style is mediocre, the psychology of the characters and their interaction very predictable. Some of the events described, and some of the dialogs, were downright ridiculous."
5,Good Grief!,"This is one of the best books I have read of late. If you have ever lost anyone close to you, this bittersweet story can help you through the greiving process with a gentle nudge. I am grateful for having read this story."
4,Engaging,This is supposed to be a sad book but the writer gives you reasons to rejoice. A chilling tale of a sad event with a gleam of hope. Sebold is an enganging writer.
4,I personally enjoyed the book,"I read the book in a matter of a few days. I had heard many things about the book being both good and bad. I decided to try the book for myself. Although, there are a few parts where the book is slow moving and even disturbing I found the book to be very interesting. It is a book that you dont really get into, or even uderstand, till it is over. You really begin to understand Suzie, the main character, by the end. It brings a new light to an explination of life after death. Althogether, I found it to be well written and interesting but I do believe it is aimed more towards a teenage audience."
1,Boring Bones is More like It!,"The book grabs you in right away and then takes you down a spiral of nothingness. I got sucked in and fell all the way down to the bottom - help!! Somebody get me out. I did finish the book, much to my regret. I kept hoping it would come back and give me a reason for the interest I had in the beginning. Sorry to say it never gave me a hint. Don't waste your time."
1,Don't fill your head with this,"Please don't read this book. It trivializes horror. Keep it as far away from young children and teenagers as possible. Teach them the evils that exist in this world and instill in them the precautions they must take to stay safe, but DO NOT let this book be their teacher. Murder, adultery, theft, betrayal, rape, teenage sex. Are these truly our bestselling themes?"
1,Lovely Bones = Maudlin,"I am stumped, not only by the popularity of this book, but by numerous critics who have chosen it among the best of 2002. It is the most maudlin, contrived story I have ever read. Drivel. Amateurish. Poorly written. Cliched. Over-hyped. Stunted character development. Tripe. The book is memorable only because I have been trying so hard to forget it and get beyond my anger with myself for falling for the hype. I can't believe I made myself finish it. I have urged others not to begin."
4,should have had a better ending,"I wasn't thrilled with this book because I was hoping for a different ending and was disappointed. Also she jumped about 5 yrs down the road and I was confused for awhile, it was a good in that I couldn't put it down. I just wish it was a little better."
1,Very Dissatisfied!,"I was expecting a very good read, after hearing and reading so many positive reviews on ""The Lovely Bones."" Sebold needs to take a different route in her writing. This is diffently a book you either love or hate. I will sell my copy to someone."
5,"Lovely Bones, Lovely Book!","My first thought on finishing The Lovely Bones, I'd probably read the best book I'll read this year..I read an ARC copy when I saw it was now available I was almost sad that I'd already read this wonderful book and didn't have it to look forward to...Don't be put off by what sounds like a rather depressing story, it is anything but that...it is almost a comforting read..Susie's heaven is one that left me smiling and actually picturing people I love who have died in just such a wonderful place..and if you are an animal lover there is one scene in this book that will touch you in a very special way...a special book this is!"
2,I enjoyed the story until...,"A book's ending can make or break it. While the majority of this story was fairly decent, it fell apart at the ending. I liked the idea that the young girl was telling her story from heaven. Unfortunately, the author seemed to have been struck with a case of writer's block at the end and asked a stranger to write the ending. That could be the only explanation. Why else would the girl come down from heaven to have sex with some boy, but never come down and reveal her killer?"
3,"Powerful ending, but not much else","Based on all the hype, I expected this novel to be better than it was. The last page was powerful, but the book itself was written in an odd, difficult-to-understand style. I had to read several of the pages more than once to understand what had happened. Not the worst book I ever read, but far, very far, from the best."
4,A diffrent view,"It was an attention grabber on the first page when the reader is advised that the main character is telling the story from her Heaven. That situation makes the story interesting as she learns about relationships that she wasn't able to understand while she was alive. It was an interesting read because of that perspective, but was maybe overwritten a bit. As each relationship is defined and settled it unnecessarily bleeds into the next character's story causing a little confusion."
3,"Dissapointed with ending, but author makes nice selection of words","I just finished the book. When I bought the book, the girl at the cashier said (as she bagged my order which included this book), she said - Oh wow, Lovely Bones, that is such a good book. I quote. I felt excited about reading it. I am always intrigued to read books about authors perspective of what heaven is like, since I miss my mom so much. Either I missed some details because I read the book post op from my elbow surgery, or the book just simply had a very anti climatic ending. I don't the murderer was ever proven or charged or discovered as the murderer, and I am not sure why the book was titled Lovely Bones. On the positive note, the author makes excellent use of words, I like the word selection and flow. But was disappointed otherwise"
4,Beautifully written story,"It is a beutifully written story.What a tragedy..But the way author has written it is another way of looking at these terrible events.I enjoyed the book very much altought the end was quite slow for me.Sometimes it was spooky too.But overall, very good read."
3,Good Read,"A good book. I never read horror or scary books but once I started this book I could not put it down and God knows I really wanted to. Very well written, I would definitely recommend it! Movie was not bad either"
3,nothing to brag about,"this book was nothing to brag about. I kinda lost interest in the reading so it was kind of hard to keep up. I really didn't picture it in my mind as I read this story, but I hope watching the movie will make this story more real for me."
4,beautiful ethereal narration; unexpectedly profound content,"The narration is so light and easy, I almost wouldn't have expected to get such a powerful story to come of it.How clever to use a fantastical, other-wordly narrative voice to paint such a realistic picture of 'horror on earth'. Given the content, the book could've easily veered off into a series of cliches about how evil must be punished, how the deceased are carried on in our memories, how true sorrow brings people together. But the book so seamlessly and cleverly avoids all of these. Instead, Sebold lets the characters be real people, make their mistakes, act kindly, meanly, appropriately, and inappropriately. And instead of a sappy, 'tie it all together' conclusion, the reader was left much like I imagine Susie's family was at the book's end: part at peace in their sorrow, part sorrowful knowing they will never be at peace."
3,A lost opportunity,"An absorbing first half, a pitiful second half. Sebold demonstrates an exceptional ability to get in the heads of her characters and develop them: the gradual maturation of her sister, the slow torment of her father and, best of all, the banality of George Harvey.**Spoilers** But then Sebold seemingly didn't know how to finish it, and concocted a happy ending: Suzie finally makes love to her boyfriend - in the body of her lesbian best friend! Yuck; Mr. Harvey gets his comeuppance from a falling icicle dropped by Suzie from above - cheap irony and facile justice. Ughh.Sebold exercises such restraint in the first half of her book I wonder if her editor said to her, ""Alice, we need a happy ending for this thing to sell."" If so, it's a crying shame."
3,good book,"Good book, but I wish I had read it before I ever saw the movie. Movies are never made to match the books, but otherwise the quality is good."
1,Inappropriate language,I purchased this book for my granddaughter because it was on a list of recommended reading at my granddaughter's Veteran Memorial Middle school's Accelerated Reader program. She started reading this book and immediately commented that the language was foul and much to her credit indicated that she would prefer not reading this book. I would not recommend this book to young people middle school age or younger.
2,book review,The beginning of this book is so disturbing that I have not finished it to this day...4 years after purchase. I have returned to it on a number of occasions and feel obligated to finish. My book club gave it positive reviews and I hear nothing but good about it.
1,Spectacularly failed to deliver,"Good start. The idea of a murdered 14-year-old telling her story as resident in heaven is an attractive idea.However, the story-telling goes down hill rapidly as the characters behave in manners so bizarre, so quickly, that as a reader I find it hard to keep interest. The most ridiculous point (amongst many) is the main character's desire to spend her only time back on earth having sex with a little boy (now grown up) who used to like her. If the girl is raped then brutally murdered at the age of 14, one would think sex is probably not the most important thing on the mind of such a soul.A good story must have a good beginning, a decent middle and an equally good end. The author has failed even at the second hurdle."
5,Distubingly Fascinating,"The Lovely Bones sucked me in from the very first page. It is not a particularly pleasant subject, but is disturbingly fascinating. The writing is compelling and I would highly recommend this book. I could not put it down!"
3,amazing until the end,"this book was so moving. it deals with the murder of this young girl in graphic and honest ways, refusing to sugar-coat it. i sobbed through a lot of it- which i never do - and found the pain so real and complicated. toward the end of the book, the author writes a scene that feels like a betrayal. it reverses everything that was so well done in the first 300 pages in a 'and then she woke up and none of it had happened' sort of way. it undermined my investment in these characters and seemed to dismiss the reality of what is lost when a child dies. i wanted to rip those pages right out of the book. without them, the story would deserve 5 stars. their inclusion cheats the reader out of a truthful depiction of grief without a fantasy cushion that doesn't really exist."
3,An Interesting Story....,The story is good and it starts out great but unfortunately it begins to drag out a bit and started to lose me about 2/3 of the way through. This might be one of the rare occasions where the movie version is better than the book.
4,First Half Promising,"I'd rate the first half of this book five stars. As the book progressed, the new ideas/perspective dwindled, and it became a predictable three-star read. I averaged the two for a four star rating--which is generous."
3,Very disappointing,"This book does not live up to its hype. It is an interesting concept, but the writing does not meet my standard for good literature. I had no desire to reread a phrase or a sentence because it was so beautifully written. This is a beach read at best."
2,this was a strange book,I am impressed that this book is so popular. It must be a reflection of the state of being in this country. I gave it to my daughter first who thought it was wierd and skimmed through it. I continued reading hoping that things would tidy up in the end and they never did. It was a stretch for me to believe all the characters and some I just couldn't. I would not recommend it.
5,An Excellent Book,"I found this book very different then most of the storylines I have ever read and I enjoyed the difference. I thought it was well done, the characters very real and the author had a way of putting the reader into the story, especially if you had suffered such a tragedy or knew someone who did in your life. Whoever said there was no closure certainly did not fully comprehend what the writer was conveying. I think that anyone who has a real compassionate nature and wants to read something that moves you will love this book. I highly recommend it."
3,Descriptive Bones,"I liked this book because Alice has an unbelievable way of showing not telling. She is incredibly descriptive about all the surroundings and or persons in this book. A great author in general.However, I didn't like this book because it had no closure. The only one with some closure was the victim herself.Sad read, I like to be uplifted a bit when I entertain myself. I wanted to see some peace out of this situation and saw none.Good read but not Great. Salute."
4,"The Lovely bones, thought provoking","After listening to this unabridged book, I felt each and everyone's complex pain. I felt that it was written very well and I was kept anxiously wanting and waiting for justice. I caught myself several times, saying WHAT? It did keep me on my toes, thinking that I knew what was going to happen and then it didn't. That does not happen often with me and was enjoyable. Sometimes I want a different type of read that departs from my hero writer, Ann Rule. And this fit the bill perfectly. I do not want to give away any of the story so I will just say that it was very interesting to hear the story written and narrated from a dead girls perspective. That's what I feel really made this story work. Enjoy!"
4,I'm just trying to be jealous with the 5 stars. Great book.,"I wish I could write a novel -- any novel, let alone a debut -- as good as THE LOVELY BONES. Perhaps it's not totally original to tell a story from the view of a murder victim or to explore in print the possibilities of the afterlife, but Alice Sebold's story is at once charming and challenging, as well as beautifully written. Watching -- through the eyes of the dead child-- a family and a community grow, change, and cope with the untimely death of one of their own, is a beautiful and painful journey."
3,The Lovely Bones: A Novel,"The book has an interesting premise. The writing was very good, but the story was a bit far fetched. A good book on a rainy Saturday afternoon, but not one I would highly recommend to others."
3,Depends on the reader,"Some may find this the best book ever written, others will not not like it all. I think I fall in the middle, it was interesting, different and entertaining, but it didn't leave me in awe afterwards like other books have."
4,Terribly Sad and Haunting,If you want a good cry - this is definitely the book for you! Sebold will take you on an adventurous ride of a dead girl's family through the eyes of the dead girl. You have no idea how sucked in you get until its over. Don't know who anyone could think this book was boring - it was a definite page-turner for me. ...
4,Memorable and Moving,"My daughter-in-law gave me her copy to read, and I had no preconceived ideas, since I had not yet heard of it. I could not put it down, and found it different from anything I have read for a long time. It was chilling in its matter-of-factness about her death, yet the voice was perfect for a young teen girl. I have been one, and raised three, and it rang true in every way. I would recommend it to any woman over 14 or so, and look forward to reading more by this author. My daughter-in-law is so cool! She turned me on to Harry Potter before she even had a child! We love sharing our strange literary tastes. Only Shakespeare and Twain get 5 stars...well, maybe Asimov."
3,Challenging...Disturbing...,"...This is an amazing first novel, brilliantly crafted, disturbing in scope. It deals with a shockingly horrible event--the rape and brutal murder of a 14-year old child--and the impact this event has on the girl herself (in heaven), her family, her friends and the murderer. It's a story of healing, of letting go, of justice.I'm not sure if I recommend it or not...the dispassionate, detached way the author deals with intensely emotional events was, for me, disturbing."
3,Kept my attention...,"This book kept my attention, but I was a little ""let down"" in the end. Flowery and wordy...but OK."
4,I was pleasantly surprised.....,I was skeptical of this book and it's concept at first but ended up really getting into it. I am not a religious person at all and was anticipating a religious overtone and it had none. I loved the fact that she wrote of a heaven that did not necessarily involve a god. I would absolutely recommend this book!
3,Too Far Out For Me,I did not like the book at all. I found it very hard to understand in some places. I could not understand the wording the author chose to use. I found myself having to read the same sentences over twice to get the meaning of what the author was saying. I still did not get it every time.A young girl who has been murdered tells the story. She is telling her story from heaven as she watches her family and friends continue their lives after her death. This part I could accept because it was shear fantasy and imagination.
4,What a surprise,"I read this book stictly because it was one of Amazon's recommendations. The unique way the story is told by Susie is englightening, funny, sad and intriguing.I only hope that people that we have lost and loved look down on us and keep us in their hearts like the book proves.I was so surprised at how it makes you laugh one minute and be in tears the next. Definitely a must-read."
2,Very depressing with dull writing style...,"I honestly don't know what all the hype is about over this book. I found it to be depressing, boring and lacking in any kind of style. I think it is highly overrated."
4,A Ghost Story from the Ghost's POV,"Michiko Kakutani nailed this book in her review in the New York Times, which I read after reading this book. (nytimes.com > books > bestsellers)I didn't think I would like Bones much because stories about 14-year-old girls put me to sleep, and heaven excites me as much as angels, unicorns, and i's dotted with hearts. But Sebold pulled me in with a good story about how a death affects the lives of those around her, at times touching, funny, exciting, and sad.Written plainly, as if told by an intelligent teenager, the story falls down only once. (I actually slapped my forehead and groaned.) But she pulled it out of that tailspin, ending satisfactorily.A good yarn. I smell movie."
4,Not a bad read!!,"It is a little slow at first, but it is worth it, the back ground information is needed. I enjoyed the book, I know I will enjoy the movie"
4,A LOVELY novel,"Let me start off by saying that this novel has a very specific audience. It's not for everyone. If you are the type of person who is into reading thrillers or murder mysteries, it's not for you. This book centers around the idea of what happens after one has passed away, not just in the perspective of a family dealing with the tragedy but the person herself. It opens up the idea about what happens after we pass away, and what happens to those ""unfinished items"" that we left behind. It has a very loving, funny yet sad tone. Don't get me wrong it's not sad and depressing. In fact the author is very witty and her writing ability makes the story that much more interesting. This book gives the hope that for anyone dealing with the loss of a loved one, that the individual who passed away is at peace in the afterlife, and that the people who experienced the loss eventually do learn to be at peace with the tragedy, and carry on with a happy memory in their heart."
3,"A good book, but.......","it didn't blow me away or anything......I just felt it was very unsatisfying when I was done with it, but I would never discourage anyone from reading it....I think Sebold does a great job at developing her characters and showing how everyone copes with their grief in different ways."
3,The Lovely Bones,"Never mind about this book. It's a pretty good read, though I found descriptions of Heaven a bit difficult to believe.Read Lucky. A powerful book about the 'victim's' sense of responsibility to others in the face of her own pain. An amazing story, and one for all women who need to believe in themselves.Unforgettable."
5,A Great Start For Alice Sebold!,"I didn't know what to expect from this novel after reading the reviews. What I do know is that I couldn't put it down. All the stories we read or hear about when someone dies are from the point of view of those left behind. Susie manages to open the doorway to a world invisible to our own. I was horrified, saddened, touched and uplifted at different times during this book. I looked forward to every page and my mind and imagination were opened just a little bit wider by the end. Read it...I know you will enjoy it."
4,Touching Side of a story by a Person in Heaven,"Lovely Bones was a great novel. I enjoyed it so much because of it's mysterious and random ways of writing, or narrating. The narrator is the Susie, a girl who was raped and murdered. She talks about how life on earth goes on without her, and she just says it so beautifuly and peacefully, even though the worst things are happening. The story was strong, and so interesting, I couldn't stop reading it, because of it's mystery, you wanting to know what happens to the characters you now love, or the murderer himself. Susie talks very descriptively about the rape at the first chapter, I shuddered at what little I read, and skipped ahead, it was just to horrible, and spine chilling. I really recommend this book to anyone who wants to be glued to the pages, and find a beautiful story written by a great author."
3,unique.. disturbing.. touching,"I usually pass hyped books; yet, a friend had recommended The Lovely Bones, so I ventured into Susie's world of heaven and earth. Susie's experience mirrors my own childhood idea of journey from life to death. The concept of wanting to comfort those you love, while you have absolutely no ability to do so. Though the story moves along quickly enough, the murderer was uninterestingly obvious."
1,wouldn't recommend,"All I can say is it's very slow. The few parts it where it starts to get interesting, comes to an abrupt halt. It's defenitly not an exciting page turner."
3,disturbing read,"This book is haunting and disturbing. I have a small daughter, and this may account for my evaluation, but I can imagine that it would be disturbing just the same for any normal person. The book forces one to be reminded of the fact that life can be utterly brutal and that horror exists in life. I liked the way the father was developed, and also the little brother. I didn't like the author's heaven. I assume that heaven is heaven, and at least you achieve peace and ""happiness"", that is beyond this world. Susie was in purgatory I believe. Maybe I am sensitive, but the book affected me strongly. The author did succeed in making her message felt. I don't like the book because of its grimness, but out of respect for the victims of horror I have to acknowledge its effect. I am trying to come to terms with it."
2,Bad Ending,"The first of the book held me. As it continued, I became frustrated trying to figure out who she was talking about at that moment. The ending was terrible and very unsatisfying."
2,The Lovely Bones,"Reading the back of the book The Lovely Bones sounds like an enchanting story, but open in it and its brutal. The descriptions of Susie murder are much too graphic and highly disturbing. If you are sensitive about things like this think twice before reading it and don't get lured into the praise on the back of the book which makes you want to read it."
4,Reassuring,"Bought at an airpot and figured it would be a sleeper. To my surprise it was quite capturing from the first couple pages. Susie Salmon tragically & abruptly taken away from earth and transported into a plane in where we all have questioned at one time or another. A beautifully written novel about love, understanding, perseverance and finally justice. It was very hard to put it down. Although the ending was far from where i though it would lead, it made me understand that the authors message was one of reassurance to life's grief of loss."
3,Over rated?,"This is one of several books I've read lately that makes me wonder what all the fuss is about. It starts with a gruesome and horrifying rape and murder of a young teenaged girl. It certainly got my attention. The murderer's and the grandmother's characters were perfect. I felt like I new and understood who they were. However, the rest of the characters were vague and I had no understanding of who they were and why they did what they did. Consequently, I just didn't care. I also didn't feel that the author herself had any understanding of what her heaven was supposed to be. So I certainly didn't. It's a great example of a book that starts with a thunderbolt and drags on in drizzle."
3,To much Filler....,"I couldn't put this book down. However, I tired of the reflections of the past. I got to the point where I would skip over those parts and read on. I also felt 3/4 of the way through the book the plot began to unravel. I wasnt' crazy about the ending. I wanted the murderer to get caught although it was very interesting of how he moved on and the discovery of other girls he had killed. All in all, I would give it 3.5 stars."
3,The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold,"This book may not be print perfect, there are a few typos and the language structure is sometimes lacking, but I found this book a good read.It begins quite brutally and because the victim is writing from her point of view, 'dead in heaven', the actual rape is quite hard to read through.I found the book a struggle until about the middle, I almost put it down, but I kept on reading and finally finished the book. The ending really gives you something. It's a hard book, not from the point of view of the reading, but the coming to terms!Hope you enjoy this book, I eventually did!"
2,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","THE LOVELY BONES certainly grabs one's attention in the first few pages. But the initial powerful surge of tension ultimately leads to a limp resolution, and in the final chapters the reader is mired in a morass of syrupy sentimentality. Sebold's ""omniscient first person"" viewpoint, morerover, though a novelty in the beginning, soon feels irritatingly manipulative; her narrator's ability not only to know the thoughts and feeling of all the other characters but, by the end of the book, actually to inhabit the body of one of those characters, is simply overkill. This was a promising but ultimately disappointing read."
3,Quaint,"Not something I would have normally read, but an interesting story all the same. The perspective is somewhat unique (which is why I picked up the book in the first place), a teenager in her own self-made Heaven. Several of the supporting characters seem two-dimensional; the detective is simply obtuse and dealing with his own emotional issues acts in a manner which is degrading to the profession. And the 'miracle' at the end, oh good grief. I think the idea is to create a sympathetic audience, and while it took a mere few hours to read, my only sympathy is for the person who wastes more time on it."
4,Great Until the End,"The premise of the Lovely Bones is that a girl has been murdered and is watching from heaven as her family deals with her death. She describes what heaven is like for her, how she feels about missing her family, and what everyone is doing below her.Given that this is the premise, you will understand how far-fetched the ending needs to be to be considered far-fetched. The author simply doesn't play by the rules she's set up for this fictitious situation. An entire book based on coming to grips with a life cut short is turned on its ear when the heroine manages to return briefly to earth. The power of the message of loss, healing and carrying on is severely damaged.That being said, the first 3/4 or so of the book is wonderful, if upsetting, and it's worth reading, although perhaps not in hardcover."
2,This novel was not lovely,"I am sorry, I really liked this book in the beginning. I found it unique and interesting. Then, about half way through, it was almost as though another author took over and began writing. I lost interest in all of it. Her focus stopped being on the murder and investigation, but on characters, I didn't understand. The ending was disappointing to say the least. This could have been a very good novel, if the author had not lost her writing style and direction, in the middle of it. I wish someone could take the idea, and write a really good novel."
2,Disappointing,"This book started out with an interesting premise. I had high hopes, but the story was shallow, incomplete and hard to believe . Comments on the book's jacket described it in part as ""funny"". I didn't see anything even remotely funny here. I finished it only for the payoff at the end, but there was none. This book didn't deliver. I wouldn't suggest you waste your time."
4,Not as good as it's made out to be,"Interesting story. Once you get past the first 15 pages (which are the hardest) the novel slows down at some parts. The miracle that takes place at the end with Ray is a little weird and was the major bump in the road. Good look at what people go through when a loved one dies, but it wasn't as good as its hype"
2,over rated.,Yes it starts well. Unfortunatly it slowly declines into mediocraty . The premis of a murder victim as first person voice is great but it should have remained a novella or short story instead of the book it became.
2,A Chore to Read,"Simply stated, this book is a chore to read. I am 3/4 of the way through, however every page is a struggle. After a pretty strong opening chapter, the book takes a nose dive into the depths of boredom and drudgery. The narrator, 15-year-old Susie Salmon, speaks in a voice well beyond her years with not much personality. The other characters are not very well developed or likeable. Her grandmother is the only interesting character in the book. I look forward to finishing this and moving on to something a little more worthwhile."
2,Skipped to the end,"Bought the hype, and regret it. The story really lost interest for me after about 60 pages, so I read the end and have skimmed a few paragraphs in between. Am so disappointed in the story have turned my attention to the strange mix of numbers and titles for chapter headings; anybody have a clue about this?Sure wish I'd waited for the paperback."
4,It was a very good book,This book I thought was very good and well wrighten. When I was told that I had to read it in my school I didn't like it because I don't like to read . But I finished this book and for not being a reader I was an incretable book.If I had to I would read it again. Susie is a very good charactor the reason why I gave it a 4 is because I realy didnt like the end of the book but other then that it was good.
2,Weird and Sad!,"This book is a totall disappointment!! I got it the second it came out because talk of it was soo great...well i dont know what the fuss is about!? First off, it is sad as all hell! Second, it is strange...not just kinda strange..its downright weird! I mean this little girl is raped and then watches her family from heaven, and then gets a chance to spend a night back on earth?? Hmmm...The book starts off OK and then it goes straight down hill! The writing is not great, its a good way to pass time if its the only book left in the bookstore..hehe..or on Amazon! Pass this one up and Read ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" by arthur golden. Now that is a good book about a girl with a hard life...and the writing is awesome."
2,What was all the hype about?,"After hearing several reviews from friends and family, I couldn't wait to get my own copy. Luckily, I didn't have to buy it myself - a good friend, who was also unimpressed with the book, lent it to me. While an easy read and not totally boring, it was not the emotional and exciting journey I was guaranteed."
1,Skip it,"The book was disjointed, cliched, and maudlin. Sebold writes like a one-dimensional Alice Hoffman. I couldn't wait to get through the stupid thing."
1,terrible book,i hated it. i thoght that it would scare all readers worst book ever i give it 2 thumbs down. what a sad excsue 4 a story. it is terrible. im sorry if u disagree but TERRIBLE BOOK. i dont recomedn this book.
2,What happened to the brilliant writer of Lucky?,"When I began The Lovely Bones, I'd just finished reading Lucky,which I think is one of the most gripping,insightful,and humorous memoirs I've ever read -- so, I couldn't wait to read Sebold's first novel.Then, to read what seemed like idle reveries of a suburban everygirl or everyboy or everydaughter or everyhousewife or everyhusband,depending on the character in Lovely Bones,well,to say I was disappointed is an everystatement.Lucky was so taut. Its prose, its plot, its magnificent dark humor, about a distinctly unhumorous crime against Sebold,kept the reader riveted. By contrast, The Lovely Bones, with its limp style and indifferent characterization made me struggle to maintain my concentration or to care about these characters.I do think that Sebold's gritty and brilliant writing in Lucky could be repeated in another book. Alas, I didn't find it in The Lovely Bones."
2,Lovely bones?,"Having many friends who recommended this book to me I was sadly disappointed with it. Maybe I'm being stupid as so far I've read only heavy praise but I felt the book sadly lacking in reality and character. Maybe that wasn't the objective of the book but when Susie Salmon fell from heaven I felt that the plot was lost. Maybe I'm not deep enough to grasp the novel. It did however take me; I read it quickly and maybe that was the problem or I'm just not the kind of person who likes reading about a girl who has been raped and murdered and is watching her family have sex and stare her murderer in the face every day. Maybe I'm staring a future classic in the face, or a book which will eventually been forgotten. Who knows."
1,What a waste ...,"This is the most unsatisfying book I've read in years. The only reason I bothered to finish was because it was the most recent choice of my book club. I kept waiting for something redeeming to occur, which didn't happen until I slammed it shut for the final time.The story is pedestrian and the writing banal. There isn't anything original about this novel, and many of the characters (i.e., the grandmother) though meant to be quirky and eccentric, are simply cliche and annoying. This book is best reserved for adolescents, but only if the goal is to inhibit their imaginations.If you feel compelled to read something unsophisticated, this is your book. But do yourself a favor ... buy a used paperback edition."
4,A book that can provoke thought and hopefully discussion about grief and loss can only be a good one!,"I didn't find this book depressing at all, far from it actually. I thouht it was a moving and healthy description of how people cope when someone very close to them died. The thoughts we think, the way we make assumptions, the guilt we feel ""...Out loud I said I had two children. Silently I said I had three."" as well as social pressures.There were times where I wanted to skim-read and move on to something else I could relate to or a faster moving scene so it's not gripped me as much as some other books have, but this novel does what it sets out to do; Make us think!... about life and death, relationships, our own ideas of heaven or what happens when we die...and overall a knowledge that grief effects us all in different ways and that although time and our lives move on, it's perfectly normal to still think about and talk about the one's we've lost."
4,Engrossing,"I am only 2/3 of the way through with this book. Unless the ending turns out to be really disappointing, I have to say it is one of the best books I have ever read. It's not exactly a literary masterpiece, but it is well-written, and it is a touching story. It will not appeal to non-sentimental readers, but it made ME cry at several points (esp. when Susie described the night of her murder, how her family was going on with their lambchop dinner and wondering where she was...I actually felt homesick!)This is a terrific book, the kind of book that is so good it actually makes you look forward to riding the NYC subway at rush hour just to get a chance to read it."
3,"Good, but it's no ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""","It's a good read and it's written in an ethereal style that's very compelling, but there's a plot point near the end of the book that drags the narrative into mawkish ""Touched by an Angel"" territory. I'd like to read more from her, though."
1,Too boring for my taste,"I think it is a well written novel technically... Well the first half that I managed to read. Maybe it's just my own personal taste, but the book is slow and pretty uneventful. A really great angle for the story by having a narative from a dead girl -- but that (for me) sems to be the only thing it has going for it. To this end I ended up reading it in pieces so it felt even slower. I think if you like a very good sensitive, well written but ultimately slow book - then it will appeal. If you want something with more bang then go check out Da Vinci code, Angels & Demons, Vanish, Secret Revelation, or State of Fear. I read all of these between reading Lovely Bones -- sorry."
2,Author seemed to lose interest in her story,"I was disappointed in The Lovely Bones. It started out well, but then the author seemed to lose interest -- dropping storylines, shifting focus, etc. Makes me wonder whether she had a decent editor."
3,The Lovely Bones,"Just not my cup of tea. I suppose it is well enough written, but it did not grab me. Certainly it may appeal to others, but the premise seems too fanciful for my taste."
1,NOT a great book,i read the first few chapters of this book and then it was boring. i didnt like it at all.
1,The Lovely Bones,I expected more from this book. Disappointing. Wish the author could decide whether it was a mystery thriller or cheap romance story.
2,not as described,"This book arrived with the jacket torn, writing and stickers on it and dog-earred. I was expecting it to come as described in 'good' condition. This was not so."
1,"Let go of this book, and move on","The problem with this story is that none of the characters are likable -- they're all passive and largely react when things happen to them. They don't have goals, and they don't have obstacles to overcome to meet those goals. The main character ""watches"" her family and friends the entire book, as if she was watching TV. She doesn't explore her heaven, she never really tries to help or connect with anyone living, etc. Perhaps I'm too picky -- I demand tension, excitement, and intelligence. Not here."
5,Haunting and delightful...,"One would think that the subject matter would be disturbing, but somehow the author makes it all seem okay. You will fall in love with the main character and find yourself cheering for her out loud. Rich and captivating; this book is a must-read for anyone. I wish it was about 200 pages longer! Keep them coming, Alice."
5,Like a trance......,"It takes me a long time to finish a book. I started reading this book one evening and found myself halfway through, trapped in it entirely. Finished the book the very next night. Not only is this book very well written, but it takes you to a place that few authors have explored before. Have you ever imagined what is going through a person's mind right before their death? In the case of this book, you nearly become one with Susie as she is enduring this initial torture, feel her relief knowing that she had survived and was going to make it through, then fall apart with her as the reality becomes true that she was not, in fact, going to make it at all. Although the beginning is rather tough to take, you become entranced by Susie, her life after her death and have hope that you have loved ones gone by that watch after you and that you may be able to do the same someday."
2,Disappointing,"I was surprised to find this book on Time Magazine's list of 2002's best fiction. I began with great expectations, but alas, the book never really got off the ground.The characters seem too light and superficial. Many promising premises are introduced: Susie's heaven, Ruth's connection with the dead, the extra-marital affair, Mr. Harvey's past. Sadly, none of these beginnings ever culminates into a satisfactory ending. They are all dealt with in a surfacy, nealtly bow-tied manner. None of the characters ever really deal with the consequences of the situations the author places them in. Susie's closure with Ray Singh and Mr. Harvey's fate are particularly disappointing. The author seems to have gotten bored with her own book and tried to end it as easily as possible.There are a few interesting passages, but overall ... flat."
3,This book is okay.,"I thought this book was very sad, especially the last paragraph. However, it is not my favorite book but I would not discourage anyone from reading it."
3,Quick & Entertaining,"I enjoyed the story and found this to be a fast read. I felt that it had a lot of areas that weren't properly developed or explored. I liked the idea of the dead being able to watch from above and live vicariously - but being able to see everything that everyone is doing all the time is kind of creepy.The whole possession of Ruth wasn't really explained well enough for my taste - just ""fell to earth""? Also odd was the mother just disappearing for 8+ years and returning. I thought that the sister, Lindsey, was one of the better characters while the brother, Buck, was not as well developed as he could have been.I haven't yet seen the movie - but already could see from the trailers they did take a lot of liberty with the story (ie, the brother saying that Susie was in the ""in-between"") among other things. I've got the movie on Netflix and will just watch it as being ""inspired by"" - rather than a strict interpretation of the somewhat under developed novel."
5,Beautiful,This is among the top 5 most beautiful and well written books I've ever read. I cant believe it's taken me this long to read this! I sucked this book down in 24 hours of non stop emotional roller coaster enjoyment... I cant say enough good things about this book. It is a must read.
3,hesitant to read it.,"i shouldn't giving review since i haven't read it yet but watched the film adaptation of it. Most of my twitter friends reads it and they have the book. i will just wait for them to finish reading so i can borrow it. i hope d story on d book has more of uplifting part bcuz i havent got much lesson from watching the film. although i have the kindle e-reader, the amazon store doesnt have the e-book, version of it anymore instead i found the audible which i cant be able to download. But i know this book is amazing according to friends who had it read. btw i really love the actress who plays Susie on the film. She is believable and has an amazing talking eyes. She's Saoirse Ronan! -Jade"
4,a very good book,i wrote down that it was 4 stars becuase it wasn't the greatest book i ever read i think it had really good plot but it kinda got boring just a tad when they were talking with her in heaven
4,Great Book--Not so Good Audio Edition,"I echo the positive comments made by thousands of other readers, but must warn about the unabridged audio version. A professional voice should have been chosen in place of the author. After listening to several chapters the monotone was so difficult to follow I had to give up and buy the Kindle version. I hear that Stanley Tucci is incredible in the movie and look forward to that later this week."
3,Not so lovely...,"I was a bit disappointed in the story. This book leaves you wanting more of something substantial. Like your really hungry, you've tried everything in the refrigerator and you still aren't satisfied. It's not badly written, it's just unfulfilling. I bought this book because they are making it into a movie and was curious about the story. Maybe the movie will be better. ***This is not a book for young girls, I wouldn't recommend it to even my teenage girls, it has a disturbing and graphic rape/murder scene. I guess that's my biggest issue, the author put more emphasis on developing that aspect of the story."
3,"I wouldn't use the word ""suspenseful""...","I was really looking forward to reading ""The Lovely Bones"" by Alice Sebold but after doing so I must say I left the book somewhat disappointed. It's not to say that the book wasn't any good, because it was very interesting at some parts and even a little enlightening; however I think there were parts of the book where the author went into too much monotonous babble over trivial things not solely related to the story concept and lost sight of what really grabbed the reader to begin with. My biggest complaint was the end the book which in my opinion lacked any feeling; the message at the end that the whole book was building up to seemed rushed or merely thrown in your face at the last minute. In the end this book could hardly be called suspenseful as it had been described. It had a good (interesting) beginning then teetered out to a pretty disappointing ending."
4,Unexpected Plot,"I had expected this book to be about the search for her murder. The story is in fact about her family dealing with her loss, there are times in the beginning of the book where it is a bit slow and boring. Watching how each family member deals with the loss in their own way was the most interesting part of the story."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this book years ago at a co-worker's insistence. I couldn't get into it then, and only now thought I would force myself to read it. It wasn't horrible in the first half, but as it went on I hated it more and more, but forced myself to finish. I completely lost respect for this book when Susie came back to Earth in Ruth's body...WHAT?! Even aside from that ridiculous plot point, I couldn't stand her writing style. Sebold really enjoyed writing ridiculously long, confusing sentences. I honestly wish I had never bought this book and bought into the hype. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Rough read with some reassuring visions about the other side,"This book was a real rough read for me as the subject matter is so unthinkable and disturbing. I really had to push myself to get through it. It's well written though, and the notions about how someone who has passed continues in the lives of those left behind were fascinating. Grief, pain, and loss are all dealt with poignantly. I'd definitely read more from Alice Sebold."
3,Lovely bones is a good book for some,It is a pretty good book but in my opinion it is to long and drawn out. I don't have a lot of time to sit down and read a book. I started reading this book because my teacher of my Literature class and some of the students in it recommended it.
5,Enjoyable and Well Written,"5 stars EnjoyableFrom the moment I read the first page of this book I was captivated by the story and I had a hard time putting this book down. I really loved the character of Susie and I thought the story was well written.When the book begins Susie is violently raped and murdered, she than narrates the story from heaven as she watches her family, friends and murderer go through life. Susie watches her father's attempt to bring her murderer to justice, her sister live the life that she might have and the boy that she kissed go on with life. I found myself crying at times and angry at others but most of all I thought this was an enjoyable book. I look forward to reading more books by Alice Sebold and I intend to read her memoirs ""Lucky"""
2,Disappointing,"There is not very much that's lovely about this novel - certainly not the writing, the plot, nor the characters."
3,Missed the mark...,"The Lovely Bones had super potential and there are beautifully written chapters - BUT- it feels way too long and sometimes falls into the ""The Lifetime Movie for Women"" category -- kind of unbelievable or soap opera-ish. What the author needed was a good and ruthless editor. I'm not saying it's not worth the read, but your eyes do glaze over for periods of time!"
5,A Life Changing Experience,"OK...I'm an avid reader and I have loved a lot of books in my time. This story touched me in a way that no other book has. The story is amazing, thought provoking, touching, scary, intellegent and intense. After reading the first chapter (and what a chapter it is)I could not put the book down. One of the professional reviews listed on the cover of the book summed up my feelings exactly. The reviewer stated that he/she ""envied"" the reader that gets to begin reading this book for the first time because the journey is amazing. I wish I could experience it for the first time again. You won't be sorry."
2,Doesn't sustain interest,"I found this book started out well, I was interested in the premise, plot and characters. But about halfway through, I started to lose interest in the story. It seemed to turn into a disjoint collection of observations on grief and death. The story fell apart at the end with a very unbelievable plot element. I am surprised that this book has been on the bestseller list as long as it has."
5,A great read,I actually bought this book back when it first came out and i think it must have been around the early 2000's... I read it and thought ok a little weird. About 8 years later i picked it up and dusted it off thinking that I couldn't remember what it was about. Its a great book and I stayed up late to read it again. I still have the copy I bought all those years ago and when I saw that there will be a movie I was awed. I would say if you haven't read it yet then do so. The story is so touching and will make the hardest person think a little more about life and death.
1,boring....,"never have i not been able to finish a book. i guess there is a first for everything. and this was it. i found the plot tedious and boring. it was like reading a school assignment. it may just be the fact that the story takes place after susie's death that i found too weird to relate to. or it may have just been the fact that i found almost every character extremely annoying. i would say to pass on this book. even though the free sample was good enough to get me interested in the story, it became increasingly boring from there on..."
3,Expected more,"It started out very well, it grabbed my attention and started pulling me in and then it just seemed to fizzle out. I was very disappointed with the last quarter of the book."
2,Excitement turned into disapointment,I was so excited to read this book but after about half way through I was waiting for it to end! I don't understand how it got such great reviews.
3,Death is only the beginning,"This was a beautifully written novel. The perspective was amazing from the ghost of the girl who dies in the first page of the book how she looks down up all those she loves and those she wanted to, and the one who murdered her. Questions I thought of while reading were, How do the dead perceive us? Do they watch us and hear what good and bad things we have to say about them? I like to think if I ever have someone I'm close to die, that I could talk to her and tell her my thoughts and feelings. I do feel we're connected to those who've passed on and this story just brings that to life.Disclaimers: There were a few scenes in here with a murder and some sex...they don't last long an I think there were a couple of f bombs, but overall the book was pretty clean."
3,"DIFFERENT, BUT NICE WAY TO PASS A LONG DRIVE","Author tends to wander off topic for extended periods, which was a bit of a put-off, but in the end was well worth the time spent."
5,Lovely Bones,"I have little spare time to sit and read, so I use audiobooks. This book was well read and an interesting take on the rape and murder of a teenage girl. I couldn't wait for the next time I was in my car driving somewhere. The book was fascinating."
2,"If you want to enjoy the novel more,","don't finish it. just skip the last 20 or 30 pages. i was loving it and ready to recommend it to family and friends... that is until i finished it. actually, it's not necessarily the ending that's so bad, just skip the part where susie jumps into ruth's body. that whole scene ruined what was otherwise a moving, and what could have been a healing, novel."
2,"Interesting Premise, Disappointing Story","After hearing so many great things about this book, my expectations had been high. It seemed an intriguing idea: a story told from the perspective of a young girl who had been murdered and could watch what becomes of her murderer and family while in heaven. I agree with the other review that it was off to a very good start. It was a fast page turner throughout the book. However the events in the last few chapters of the book were rather silly, especially what becomes of the murderer. It was a great idea for a story, but the story didn't turn out to be as great as the idea."
3,Lovely Bones Lacked calcium,"The Lovely Bones is a good book, but it doesn't know what it wants to be. The first chapter is the best chapter in the whole book and then it all went down hill from there. One mintue the story about Susie, the next is about her friend, and in between it's about her mom. It's like a book of short stories with no central theme. Is it a suspense story or love story? The switching body part of the story is totally out of context. Read the first half of the book and then jump to the ending. you won't miss a thing."
2,A Waste of Time,"This book takes place in a small town in the 1970's. It's about a young girl who is mysteriously killed and everything that comes after. The main charecter, Susie, is telling the story from heaven. She just sits back and watches everyone on earth. In heaven she gets everything and anything she wants. As Susie watches he murderer get away and her family fall apart, she realizes how much she misses her friends and family. After ten years it finally happens her family is all back together. Her mom left then came back later and now the family is coming together again. Now everyone can finally move on with their lives and get over Susie's death. Over all I thought that this book wasn't very good. It was exciting in the beginning then just trailed off into other topics and got very weird. Basiclly I would'nt recomend this book to anyone. It was a waste of time."
3,Opening was good,"I know this is now a major motion picture, but it makes me wonder if they are running short of good ideas for movies these days. Overall, I thought the book was OK. The opening is excellent, but then I found myself slowly losing interest. I did like how the evil killer is rendered and there is certainly a certain amount of creepiness conveyed that makes this book one I would recommend on that account alone. I do lean more toward the classics, so I can't say I am the normal reader of this type of fiction. So I am sort of in the middle (thus a 3 rating)."
2,completely not what I expected,"After much hype about this book and my friends telling me I just had to read it I picked this book up on a run to the store. It was a very slow read and it jumped around a lot. At some points I found myself confused because I wasn't sure where this passage/anecdote came from. I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't. The last fourty pages seemed to have nothing to do with the rest of the book and yes, like some other reviewers I felt cheated. The end was not what I expected. I felt nothing was wrapped up and there was a lot of build up only to drop u in the end."
5,Extraordinary. A very rewarding experience.,"I find myself recommending this book to more and more people. THE LOVELY BONES is like a symphony with not a note out of place. It's very well written and well edited. I appreciate all the finish work put into this, which is all too rare these days in publishing. Everything about the book is finely polished. And it is beautifully put together. The language reminds me of WHITE OLEANDER in which the author used words and metaphors in new ways to make us see in new ways. What an experience, to look at life and death from this whole new perspective. I hated to see it end. In fact, I found myself crying. I read it basically in one sitting -- I simply couldn't put it down. Such a good read! I can't get over how excellent this book is -- it's a fine, fine work of art that will last a long time in the literary world. Fun, tense, quiet, reflective, horrifying, sad, peaceful, joyful, loving. And it makes you think. And feel. And think again. An astounding book."
2,What a disappointment,"After all the publicity and hype, this book is my most disappointing read in a long time. Sure, there are moments of powerful reflection, especially on the relationship between children and their parents. But the prose here is pedestrian at best and the characters are hardly developed in interesting ways at all. And there is no real ending to this book. Readers looking for interesting and compelling novels would do much better by reading recent novels authored by Geraldine Brooks, Julia Glass, and Kate Jennings, all of which deserve the acclaim, attention, and publicity that this book has received by the mainstream book publishing/advertising industry."
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"I was anxious to read this book because of all the hype surrounding it. I read this in an evening (I average about a book a day) and was disappointed. I have read that this is destined to be a classic like ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" which is my favorite book of all time. Uh, sorry, I don't see this being required reading at high schools. The book is very well-written, the descriptions are beautiful and some of the passages are heartbreaking. It is a bit weird, especially toward the end, with the narrator being dead and the very quick passage of time. It is a touching story and I found myself getting a bit choked up but this is not a book I will read over and over again and or even probably think about a week from now. Please read this and enjoy it, but don't fall into the trap of this being one of the greatest novels ever written as some people would have you believe."
5,Outstanding read.,"Having read several reviews about the subject of this book, it was a bit difficult for me to decide to actually sit down and read it. But, it kept pulling at me, and, after hearing the author talk about writing the book, I knew I would have to read it. Once, I finally did open it, I gulped it down in one sitting. Like many other readers, I was sorry to see it end, but, unable to slow down. I hoped for peace for Suzie's family, and, justice to catch up with Mr. Harvey. Ms Sebold reminds me that, very often, life deals to us in ways we never would have expected or wanted, but, she reminds me so gently that I am left shaking my head saying, 'That's right, that's how things are here.'I highly recommend this book, and, look forward to anything else Ms Sebold offers in the future."
3,Ouch.,The writer does a very good job showing us pain and how different people deal with hurt and loss. I'm sure it'll make an interesting movie wherein you'll watch several people cry.
4,Completely captures the reader.,"From page one, you won't be able to put this book down. Although a tragic tale, you can't help feeling hopeful in the end. Well worth reading. Eloquently written, suspenseful, and captivating."
5,AWESOME,This book is a #1 in my book. Alice Sebold hit the jackpot...I have read it and I am buying on for all my reading buddies.
1,lost it's way,This story was all over the place. It started out with a bang and it was all down hill from there. It was not a mystery. It was not a love story. It had NO POINT! I am sorry I purchased the book and I would not recomend it to anyone!!!
3,"Okay, but uneven","I wanted to love ""The Lovely Bones,"" but ultimately just thought it was so-so. The concept is excellent, and Sebold starts off very well. However, toward the last 1/3 or so of the book, it just got too strange to tolerate; Sebold wrote herself into a hole, really. Far from being romantic, I found Susie's posthumous love-via-bodily possession thread disturbingly creepy. And the ending left me wanting. I don't think ""The Lovely Bones"" deserves the hype it's received."
2,got through it,"I'm not really sure how to describe my thoughts on this novel...On the one hand I found it thought provoking and I really appreciated Sebold's vision of heaven, but on the other I really found myself waiting to love the book. Well sad to say that moment never came. I just kept thinking that I was really glad that I hadn't just lost a loved one, because instead of finding the book theraputic I just found it awkward.This book does portray human struggles, but I wouldn't give it to someone who is struggling."
2,Overrated,"After I finished this book, I looked at the adulatory reviews on the back cover, and wondered what I was missing. I was really drawn in at first, but then kept wondering why we had to keep hearing about the boring family when what I really wanted to know was what heaven was like. Apparently heaven is is a big yawnfest."
3,Started out so well . . . and fizzled out.,"This book, as so many other readers have noted, started out very strong (albeit, disturbing) and then just ""lost it"" in the middle. The writing itself was wonderful, but the plot meandered in the second half of the book. The mother's abandonment of her family was where it started to break down. And, there were scenes that were REALLY out of place - like the 14 year-old protagonist falling out of heaven to inhabit her friend's body and, while here on earth temporarily, begged her old boyfriend to have sex with her. Also unrealistic was that she appeared to be in a heaven without the existence of a God. The book certainly lacked focus toward the end, and the ultimate comeuppance for the murderer was extremely unsatisfying."
3,Unique and artfully written,"This novel is a breath of fresh air in many respects, especially in its unique point of view. A story told from the perspective of someone who is already dead is quite intriguing indeed. The story is well-paced and beautifully written, although there were times when it was difficult to read. The opening scene, in which Susie is murdered, is disturbing while not overly-graphic, but it was even more difficult, as a reader, to eavesdrop on this family as they fall apart in the wake of this horrific tragedy. The end, I felt, was a bit too pat, but all in all I came away from this novel satisfied. It's a very good read."
2,Dissapointing,"This book was rather disturbing. It's hard to read about murder from the perspective of the 14 year-old victim. It was thought-provoking, but I found it to be lacking something. Once I figure out what that is, I will update this review."
1,Very disturbing.,"This book was brought up to be this amazing novel that touched hearts around the nation, but I felt that it was very disturbing. Nothing happy happened and it portrayed a very bad outcome of death. I definatley do not reccommend."
1,Don't bother,I can't believe I did. And I can't understand why this book has stayed on the best-seller list for as long as it has. I finished it only because I hate to not finish books. I didn't care a hoot whether or not the murderer was caught. And guess what? He wasn't. What a lame ending.
1,[bites],this book ...-its a phony book-- its a great idea-- thats all- it goes nowhere really slowly-- i was intrigued-- for a few pages then felt manipualted and bored - and ripped off--- dont waste yer time !
2,Over-hyped,I have just completed this book and it was a major disappointment. I am still trying to understand all the hype for this novel.The beginning of the book holds a lot of promise but any interest in the characters dies about a third of the way through. I had to force myself to finish the last 30 pages.Don't waste your money on this piece of fluff.
2,big disappointment,"wow, did this book get hyped to me. but it falls far short of the mark and it is, finally, exploitive of its horrendous subject matter. muddled and so not worth it."
2,Over-rated!!,"The perspective and thoughts of heaven are interesting, but the plot is very, very thin. Also, the part where she comes down from heaven and makes love, well, it's kind of silly. Moreover, if the detective had any clue, he should of solved the murder immediately. I mean there is a single man who gives everyone the heebie-jeebies, lives near-by, and no one initally interviews him or visits the local dump site. It stains the crediblity of the plot. There are a lot of books that are a better read!"
3,the lovely bones,I enjoyed The Lovely Bones simply because it was such an unusual read. The story grabbed me and would not let me go until I Finished it. I do think the story left us with out closure but perhaps that personifies real life.
3,Lost interest,"When I first started this book, I couldn't put it down, although a morbid sad story, it got me hooked. Unfortunately, I found the mothers reaction to the situation rather hard to believe, as hard as I tried to put myself in her shoes, I just could never ever abandon the rest of my family. I also thought it was strange how the murderer could just disappear from the neighborhood without being located, to me it was just too unreal, so therefore I lost interest toward the end. I also agree with another reader as far as the closure at the end."
4,"Not Quite What I Expected, but Good","This was a very thought-provoking book. At first glance the book seems to be about her murder and the man who killed her and how she was killed, but then it grows into something different. It is more about how her family comes to term with her death over the passage of weeks and months and years. It's about new beginnings and saying goodbye.I quite liked this book. I think it gives the reader a lot of things to think about. Whether or not your idea of what heaven is like concurs with the author (mine doesn't), telling the story from the point of view of someone who has died is quite interesting."
4,Beautiful. But not as good as Lucky.,Lovely bones is lovely. But not as lovely as Lucky (by the same author).
2,Lovely bones,"Although I read this book in spanish I agree with those people who think that it was, generally speaking, a very good beginning and a very bad ending. Is an example about what a writer shouldn't do with a good idea. Ms. Sebold had the characters in her hands and made up a very sympathetic heaven. She had it all, so I don't know why she spoil it. Unfortunately she betrayed her own work by rising up some ingenuous ghost like Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in ""Ghost"".In the end: the winners take nothing."
4,LOVED IT!!,"I loved this book! I hated reading, but my cousin told me I had to read this book and I am glad I did! I love to read now and this book really made me think, I love to hear other peoples ideas and thoughts on what heaven is like. I was disapointed at the ending and how rushed the last few chapters were, but still I love this book."
4,Have you ever lost someone you loved?,"I have read this book twice now and I truly enjoyed both readings. If you have ever lost someone in your life, it brings some comfort to know that they might be watching from the distance. Part of the charm of the book is the realistic way the tragedy that can tear a family apart is portrayed. Although the tragic ending seemed far fetched (and face it, a story told from the beyond is all greatly imaginative), I was glad that the evil one got what he deserved."
5,Wonderful book!,"I recently read this book. I enjoyed it thoroughly! I had a hard time putting it down, yet didn't want the story to end when I was down to the last chapters. Sebold's visions of heaven and getting to know each character was a thrill. For an easy and entertaining read, I highly recommend this book."
2,Eh...really wasn't that great,"I didn't relate to any of the characters, and despite the tragedy that happened, I couldn't feel any sympathy for them. They were distant and cold. The story itself was like a puzzle that didn't quite fit together. And the killer got off pretty easy in my opinion. [...]"
2,Lovely Bones,"This book had a good message, in the end. I would not recommend this book to anyone who cannot handle slightly disgusting situations. At the very beginning, the main character has some troubles, and the author describes it in gruesome detail. There are also some parts which are very risque. However, at the end of the book I was happy for the character and her family. Throughout most of the book, I was either sad for the situation or literally ""grossed-out"". This was quite a depressing read actually, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who couldn't handle it (if you know what I mean). This was not one of my favorites. I hope my review has been helpful!"
4,The Lovely Bones,"This book was very interesting. It took the reader into two different aspects of the narrator (Susie Salmon)'s life. She told how her life was on earth, and described her after-life in heaven. I really liked how though Susie would never grow up, throughout the book, the reader watched her family and friends grow to become adults. The book was somewhat confusing in certain parts, but for the most part, I really enjoied it. I would definately recommend it."
4,Wonderful!!!!,"I think that ""The Lovely Bones"" has been the best novel I've read in quite a while. I don't think another author could have had Ms. Sebold's perspective. I thought it was beautifully written & I didn't want to put it down. I found the plot engrossing and the characters well developed to the point that it didn't feel like a book, it felt real. It was very sad, but really worth reading anyway. I gave it a 4 becuase it had some awkward moments & seem to twindle a little near the end, but overall, I really enjoyed ""The Lovely Bones"" & would recommend it."
4,Not everyone's cup of tea,"Susie Salmon is ripped from her family by violence at the age of fourteen. The story is told from her point of view looking down on the world from heaven. After putting herself back together she watches as her family grieves, the man who killed her goes on with life and watches her sister and brother grow up. The first two thirds of this book kept my attention as we watch her family pick up the pieces and move on with life. Her father isconsumed with the need to find the man who killed his daughter and bring justice to Susie. Her mother is an unlikeable character as she compromises the investigation by becoming friendly with the lead detective and then leaving home. Her brother copes bestby just pretending Susie was never here and leads a good life. Her sister is where the focus shifts and became the downfall of this book. If Sebold would of not aged the characters so many years and had a more realistic ending this book would of been a 10."
1,Would of rather taken a walk through the cemetery,I have to admit that I had very high expectations of this book after seeing it top the book charts for so long. I think people are comforted about the fact that their was depiction of heaven. Anyone who has ever lost a loved one despite the circumstances surrounding the death has to have a certain curiosity of the after life. I only read about 200 pages of this book and decided I would rather be reading a good Stephen King novel.
4,Wonderful writing / painful book,"First off, let me say that anyone who has a daughter, and even an ounce of empathy, will find this book physically painful to read. That said, it is a beautifully written, very poignant story of a young girl's murder, yes, but even more about the effect that crime has on her family. The narrative voice is that of the girl from ""heaven"" or the ""afterlife,"" as she recalls her life and watches as life moves on for those left behind. To be honest, I found the end a bit facile and silly, but still, overall, I would recommend this book to any serious reader."
4,unique fiction,"Normally I am not interested in reading fiction. However, Sebold's ""The Lovely Bones"" had me hooked from the very first chapter. The author's perspective is unique and while the subject is death, the book is upbeat and enchanting.Sebold has an uncanny ability to jump from gender to gender, age to age, and paint a picture of incredible detail that makes the reader believe the herone, 14-year-old deceased Susie Salmon, is indeed looking down from her prison/heaven and experiencing the pain, joy, and emotions each of her loved ones have endured since her murder.The description of homicide detective Len Fenerman's feelings about ""wounded women"" on Page 272 is both compact and compassionate. ""The wife in the bait-'n'-tackle shop had no bruises on her fact but cowered like a dog and spoke in apologetic whispers.""It is that kind of tightness of thought that could place Sebold in the same category as John Steinbeck and Pearl Buck as she continues to hone her craft."
1,Disappointed,"I looked forward to reading this book, however, found it to be predictable and mediocre.A tragic beginning was a ploy to hold my interest, but it was lost like the victim. Then the nameless town, faceless people, proverbial parental and children problems , and lackluster language added up to the common comment of money lost."
3,A good start- a terrible finish,"This novel is one I would recommend to a friend with some hesitation. It starts off with a portrait of family pain so crisp and expertly written that your own heart and gut will feel the wound. However, that novel with its dramatic realism and captivating portraits (Susie, Lindsey and their Dad) veers off into a landscape I disliked: the characters of Mr.Harvey and Abigail are essentially not well-described and the tone for both is indefinite. But the real flaw of the book is an ending ... that reads as tacked on, almost compulsively Cheerful. It is a false cheer and the opposite of the rest of the book. Nevertheless, this book is a cultural touchstone now and it is fun to argue over. Overall, a good book but not a great one."
4,Emotional and Compelling.,"I loved this book and couldn't put it down once I started reading it. Unlike some of the other people who have posted comments here, I must say that I connected with the characters in this novel from the very beginning. Sebold makes the grief that this family endures, particularly the father's, palpable. Anyone who has a young child can feel the weight of the father's loss as he sits in his den remembering the moments that he wished he had treasured.The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because the book does get a bit long toward the end. All in all, however, a terrific read."
3,"Good, not great","This book, which came highly recommemded from critics, is a highly creative novel dealing with death, grief, and the necessity of letting go. It's told by the lively Susie Salmon, someone who is dead by the end of the first chapter. She tells her story from a heaven of sorts, looking down on her family and charting their grief and gradual acceptance of her death. Amazingly, even with this subject matter, the book is never depressing, never too somber. I liked it, but I think I came into it expecting too much--thanks in large part to the glowing reviews. It didn't quite deliver, especially with the ending. It seemed like the author wanted to take a complex subject, which she at first dealt with fairly, and wrap it up in a neat little box with a bow on top. That is not to say I don't recommend it. I do. Just don't expect a masterpiece."
4,Disturbing and sweet.,It's a good story with a complex web of emotions and characters. It hooks you early and drags you through. The ending is satifying and endearing.
3,melancholy,"My co-worker insisted I read this novel. Lovely Bones is bittersweet. I think the author could have done a better job portraying the events that took place in the book. I wanted to be emotional. I wanted to scream, cry, laugh, but there was never one part that really struck a cord. Would I recommend this book? The answer is no."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT Audio Book Unabrid 9cds,"14 yr old Susie Salmon has been raped and dismembered in the field near her home in the 1970s by a serial killer.In heaven, Susie can see the impact her murder has on family and friends. As a spectator and sometimes participant in earthly activities, she is able to maintain connected to the living in ways that most people on earth fail to notice.Overall, a good book but not a great book and not the earth-shaking masterpiece that some would have you believe.I am stingy with the stars as I found the thought of Susie not just hanging around watching her family for a couple of weeks but she followed them around for years as a spirit watching. I found that thought disturbing. I would have given it a 2 star but I will give it a 3 star as I shouldn't penalise the author because I found the spirit idea disturbing. The first 1/3 of the story much better than the rest of it."
5,I could'nt stop reading!!,This was such a good book. I love the story it was very easy to get pulled into. I really liked the way that the author described the way the characters felt and how she explained things in their point of view. I would definitly recomend this book to any teenager.
5,A mystery watched from heaven,I thuroughly enjoyed this book hands down my favortie. The imagery and storyline is so believeable it make you cry. The reader hangs on bated breath watching as susie does. I strongly recommend.
3,i dont recomend.,"i read this book for my english class.i heard SO much about it. it was on OPRAH as one of her favorites.. yadie yadie yadda.the first few chapters were pretty good, sucked me in. but.. after that.. it began to get very slow,i kept reading it, thinking that something GOOD was about to happen, because thats how it seemed.it didnt.i guess its an OKAY book. but, i warn, at times, very very slow.it also flashes back alot into the past, which at times gets a little confussing.its not a bad book though, but, not the best i've read.i wouldnt recomend to teenagers."
4,Everyone should read it!,"One day in December, a young girl named Susie Salmon was on her way home when she was stopped in the field by her neighbor. After some talking, he rapes her and murders her. All anyone finds of her body is an elbow, which the dog brings home. This is an excellent book. Susie goes to heaven and watches down on her family. She's able to watch the many struggles her family goes through while grieving over her. This book shows how people act when they loose a loved one. Susie likes watching her family from heaven and often she pretends that she is living in her sister's life. Susie dreams of going to high school. All she wants to do is be a kid again. This book really hooks you in. You want to keep reading to see what her family does next. Whether it's her dad stalking the neighbors or her mom moving to California, you never know what's going to happen next. The Lovely Bones is a great book. I think that everyone should read it."
2,Not what I expected,"I picked up this book becuase I had heard phenominal things about Alice Seabold and there seemed to be a lot of anticipation for the release of this book. First and formost, I must tell you its NOT a murder mystery as the synopsis lead me to think. Its not about finding the killer or anything. Its basicly about a family's healing process after a daughter was murdered. I proably would't be so bitter about the book had I known the focus wasn't on the murder, but on the family instead. Other than that, the writing was eloquent but a touch on the flowery side at times. Not a terrible read as long as you understand where its suposed to lead."
2,"dull lit, but a promising script","While reading ""The Lovely Bones"" I constantly complained of it's lack of style. Yes, style should be an important element in literature--especially in work that elicited that much RAVING.The premise was compelling, but the writing was dull, which made me utter the premonition: ""In the right hands, this could make a good film""When I found out that Peter Jackson and his equally talented wife would be doing just that, I breathed a sigh of relief. You see, I do hope that they can make a heavenly creature (;->) out of them bones."
3,Suspense,"In The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold, Susie Salmon gets raped and brutally murdered. This event starts the book and then it follows Susie as she tells the rest of the story from her view of Earth from heaven. She was a fourteen-year-old girl heading home from school one day when the tragedy occurred. Right away you witness Susie's family fall apart and the mystery of who her killer was get the best of them. The story is in Susie's point of view in heaven and she watches certain people continue on with life without her.This book was very suspenseful. Having Susie tell the story you, as a reader, know everything about everyone, but she can't change their actions; so you know if someone is doing something they shouldn't but they don't. It is also very original and written unlike many books. But, it can be a little confusing at times and is meant for older teens and adults. This book makes you think a lot about trust and how you always have to follow your instinct."
4,The Lovely Bones,"The book, The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold was a very interesting suspense-filled mystery novel. It was really enjoyable to read this book because it was very different from other novels I have read. It was interesting to see the author's different view on heaven and what she might imagine it to be like. This book kept me reading with its very well described situation and its thought-provoking suspense. It raises many issues dealing with the outside world, such a child molestation and murder. It gives you a glimpse of the pain and grief that grows within a family who has had this type of terrible tragedy arise. Although the book was fiction, many issues in The Lovely Bones have happened frequently in real life and in ways could be considered a non-fiction novel. This book was a very good book, and very suspenseful, although, at certain points, it was kind of slow."
4,"If you have a heart, 1st chapter will make you cry.","If you're up for a depressing read, this is the book for you. The first chapter had me bawling. The Susie character is gripping from the very 1st page.The book starts strong and wanes a bit as it goes along. I was more interested in Susie's heaven then what was going on down on Earth.The ending really stretched it bit and pulled me out of the story.Overall, recommended."
3,Just Okay,This book was just okay for me. Maybe the sadness left on earth after her death was just too intense. Or maybe the detached way she looked back was not intense enough. Just not my cup of tea.Sandra Wilkes
2,EEhh.. not all that great..,"This book wasn't that great at all. It was very hard for me to keep on reading it. It was somewhat boring and a slow read. There is a story line, but it is just plain boring. A couple of times I wanted to stop reading it, but I kept going hoping it would get better but it never did. Not a book I enjoyed."
4,"Easy read, but worth it","This book was a bit over the top - and the ending feels rushed - but it really was a worthwhile read. The narrator is fun, witty and very likeable and the author tells the story with feeling, and good emotion. The writing is clean and crisp, with some flowery prose - but that's expected from a 14 year old narrator so the flowery prose is believable. I enjoyed the book and finished it in two days, reading several hours per day."
1,Now I remember . . .,"I finally broke down and read this book because of all the buzz it generated - after all, ""Cold Mountain"" generated a lot of buzz, and it was an excellent book. Unfortunately, this book reminded me of why I shy away from books on the best seller lists: They're usually pap. I think I'll go back to avoiding the best seller lists."
1,Hated this book w/a passion,"Read this for a book club and absolutely hated it. The writing was awful, the characters unbelievable and I can't understand its popularity at all."
1,I couldn't get through this book,I loved the reviews of this book and the outline. I was very excited but unfortunately I couldn't get through the first pages. I kept reading and it was just boring. Maybe it wasn't my style but wasn't what I was expecting. I did not like this book at all.
2,Not So Lovely Bones,"This book was probably a catharsis for the author to write but it wasn't a story that worked for me. I bought it because of the media hype and actually did find it to be very well written. The topic of death and what the victim was thinking and observing while in heaven sounded very interesting. However, as I was reading the story, the sadness was so overwhelming it was hard to shake. I simply hurt too much. It wasn't until literally the last handful of pages that any resolution was achieved. Sorry to be one of the rare nay-sayers for this book, but I won't be recommending it."
3,So-so at best..,"For this book to even have appeared on the NY Times bestsellers list was impressive, for it to STAY on the list for so long was very impressive. That was one of the main reasons I wanted to read it...that, and the reviews written here....most of which were glowing. I was bitterly disappointed in this book, and cannot, for the life of me, understand how it ever made the Best sellers list in the first place. To me, it had zero depth. But then, an awful lot of people loved it....they MUST have seen something in this book that I failed to see. I would advise anyone considering reading this book to do so....everyone's taste is different and you may love it. Me? I found it an overlong waste of time. The closest thing I can compare it to, in depth and interest is a magazine story....OK to read while trapped in a doctor's waiting room....but not worth taking you time otherwise."
3,Not a book about God or Heaven,"To me, that best describes this book. I, unlike most others, picked up the book, read the inside jacket and figured it sounded good. I must have missed all the media hype!! To me, this book was about lost relationships and regrets. Hopefully this won't sound corny but it made me think of what legacy I'd like to leave behind to those who love me and what I would like to accomplish before its over. I found the book long winded and a bit contrived while trying hard to be original. I put it down and picked it up several times. I didn't find it hard hitting or emotional until the last few chapters. I cried hard as I finished the book. But I really didn't expect that kind of response from me early or even mid-way through the book. The parts where she's in Heaven... well... I wasn't impressed. But overall I gave it 3 stars because of the ending."
1,I don't get it,"I found the writing in this book to be rather trite and cursory. The story was quite fluffy and the ending very Hollywood. I really don't get all the hype around it; it was the hype that led me to it, and I was sorely disappointed."
3,Great premise,"The Lovely Bones is not exactly a mystery, for we know ""whodunnit"" immediately, but it is fascinating to read a story written from the murder victim's perspective. The plot involves the main character watching her family learn how to deal with loss, a community coping with the horror of the crime committed, and how ""justice"" comes about. I couldn't put it down, but I must recommend this book with caution. There is some sexuality (the main character longs for physical love that she never had a chance to experience) and a bizarre scene where another character is possessed by this dead girl. Without these aspects, the book would be rated 5 stars, in my opinion."
3,The Lovely Bones,"I could have put this book down at any moment of the first 100 pages. It did pick up after that. If you are ""afraid"" to read it because of the gore...there is none. Things are hinted but not really stated out. It is not sit on the edge of your seat exciting but it does hold your interest. For a part of the book I had the feeling it was going to turn into a Stephen King novel but that never happened. Kind of a let down. My book club met on this book and the biggest discussion out of it was about heaven/hell/after life and what we believe in and why."
2,Too Bleak,"I read this book on a recommendation from a friend, who said it was good, but sad. How true! Though I did read the entire book, I did not feel uplifted at the end. I had to take breaks between reading the chapters because I found it to be such an incredibly bleak story, and so very sad. While it was a well written story with an excellent premise, I just felt it was too sad to give it more than two stars."
5,A surprisingly upbeat book about tragedy,"Despite its morbid premise, this book left me feeling uplifted. This is a tale of a community's response to tragedy, the rape and murder of a beloved teenage girl. While the aftershock of her disappearance has understandably negative results on her family and neighborhood, the story was crafted in such a way that it ended up as a narrative of hope, not depression. More importantly, this was one of the better books I read in 2003. It kept me riveted from the first page. I would definitely recommend it."
2,Very slow,"You know, I didn't care for this book very much at all. The beginning of the book really got to me and stayed with me for awhile as the author painted a very vivid picture of the murder. However, after that it just seemed to drag on forever. I also felt a bit let down by the fate of the murderer. I know that not every villian needs to ""get his"" in order to satisfy me but it just seemed to be a very anti-climatic end. A well written book but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Overated!,"I finished this book just because I wanted to see how it ended, not because I was captivated by the story. When I read that blurb on the book I wanted to read it as it seemed to be a very unique plotline, and it was. But for me that is pretty much where the interest ended. I don't know what the book was trying to SAY to me. Although Susie was the central character, we really didnt learn much about her other than the murder and her young crush. Another reviewer on here had the problem with the fact that everything tied up nicely, I would have to agree. To me the story was very ""Hollywood"" - nice happy ending which was strange considering the premise of the book! Would not recommend it."
1,Maudlin gimmickry.,"Like many others I was led to believe that this was an outstanding example of serious literature. What it was, after reading seventy pages, I discovered, was silly hokum and a brazen attempt at bathos to move everyone to tears. It's like a fairy tale that turns into a nightmare of boredom. It will be amusing to see the author's next ployto make a lot of money while having really nothing to say. Save your time. Read DINO instead."
1,Overrated,"After reading many great reviews about this book I finally broke down and bought it, and it was a waste of my time and money. While the book is not dreadfull, it is certainly not good. I found the writing to be very immature and the story to be unimaginative. Sebold could have done a much better job on this story since it felt rushed and thrown together. The characters could have been developed much better, the best lines in the book are about the father and I wish that Sebold would have spent more time on this and the mother. Many reviews detail the emotion that this book evokes, and I just didn't feel anything remotely close while reading. This story could have been great, but the writing just falls flat. If you really want to read this wait until its on the discount shelf because it is not worth it now."
1,Depressing with no merit,"I hardly ever dislike books this strongly, but I absolutely hated this book. In fact, my entire book group disliked it as well. I have tried to figure out why this book is popular but cannot find a reason. It is depressing, parts of it are ridiculous, it is slow moving, and disturbing. The concept could be interesting in the hands of a more talented writer, but in the hands of this writer it ends up being completely unsatisfying."
5,Inspirational,"How unusual. In early creative writing courses, we often had to retell a story (such as Cinderella) from the point of view of one of the characters (say, the mouse). At the time, I thought it was silly. But the telling of this story by the dead victim is brilliant. And gives me hope for all of us about the ""Great Beyond"" and the ""Rainbows Bridge."" What a great story. A real page turner. Geared more to womens' feelings, than mens', I think."
1,choppy sentences,"This book was hard to understand because of the sentence structure. Choppy sentences that went no-where-""worked together, the snow falling, almost wafting, down"", and ""He had his family walking through the streets, going to school, passing, on their way, Mr. Harvey's green-shingled house"". To be fair, I just finished ""Empire Falls, by Richard Russo. Mr. Russo writes in a smooth, elegant fashion. I will give a book 50 pages to convince me its worth my time. I stopped at page 43."
2,How does this [stuff] get published?,"What a ridiculous premise. The writing was competent, but I hope the author learns the art of concept, storyline, and character development next time, instead of wasting her promising abilities on utter silliness. Who agents this kind of incoherent, artless offering? Good grief. Susie Salmon (""like the fish"")????? Aye-yi-yi."
1,Hated it!!!,I feel that I'm being generous in even giving it one star. I've never hated a book so much as I hate this one. And I recently saw that it's going to become a movie. Why would they want to torture those who were fortunate enough to not have read the book??? I honestly do NOT understand why so many people seem to really like this book. It's simply not worth reading.
4,Interesting concept,"I bought the book after hearing about it from friends and found it interesting but not one I ""couldn't put down"". Definitely a great ""first novel"" and deserving of an award. However, I felt it had a weak ending as though the author ran out of steam.It's definitely a book I could recommend but not one I'll read again and again."
1,1 star is rating this book to highly,"This was absolutely the WORST book I have ever read. Hopefully no one will waste their time reading it. I can't understand how this book was even published, what an embarrassment to the publishing company to put their name on it. Honestly I can't describe how much i hated this book. Don't make the same mistake I did by buying or reading it."
1,What a disappointment!,"I saw Anna Quindlen on the Today show promoting this book as a ""future classic"" and the best book she had read in years. She either must be a friend of Alice Seibold's or is receiving some kind of kickback from the publisher. I could not wait for this book to come out and submitted to the hype. Having recently suffered an expected death in my family, I was prepared for a life changing book with some profound meaning and depth. What I got instead was over hyped, amateurish, cliche, overhyped drivel."
1,One word: overrated,"I checked out this book on premise alone. Great premise, I have to say. The first third of the book was well-written, and I liked her concept of a religiously neutral heaven. But after the first hundred pages, the book started meandering. She kept rambling on about the members of her family, and it was so distant I couldn't sympathize with anyone but Susie's little brother. Then by the last third, it got just plain bad. Worst. Conclusion. Ever.Given the schmaltziness of most of the book, I think the author was desparately trying to get into Oprah's Book Club. ""Hey Oprah, I'm depressing! Can I be in your book club too?""So one star for the premise and the first hundred pages. I think that's all her agent and editor read."
1,Most Disappointing Book I've Ever Read!,This book starts out extremely interesting and leads you to believe she will be able to help her family through the tough times. The story was extremely disappointing and goes on and on without approaching the real subject. I found the ending aggrevating and not worth my time of the entire read. The publicity this book has had is ridiculous and people who actually read this book in it's entirety I believe would feel the same. This is one book I would recommend not believing in all the hype. I bought it before it became so recommended and am still in awe at the push to sell this book.
3,"Not as good as I'd hoped, not as bad as I'd feared","Newspaper and magazine reviewers do no one a favor when they over-hype a small book like this one. This novel is okay, but I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd known less about it and hadn't been primed for some sort of major literary miracle."
1,Zero Stars,"The Lovely Bones is written on a fifth-grade level. The characters are one-dimensional and the dialogue is awkward and pedestrian. This is the only book I've ever read where the author starts the book with a certain cadence to her prose and never veers from it. Unbelievable that she could maintain the same boring rhythm throughout the book by having every sentence march to the same beat. There also seems to be a notable lack of vocabulary. Maybe the idea was to have everything sound like it was coming from the land of the dead. The author succeeded in that respect. The book reads more like a first-draft produced by a novice rather than a book written by a professional. If I had written it myself, I would have been too embarrassed to submit it to a publisher."
3,I Just Don't Know...,"I'd heard that this book wasn't one of the best, and I just had to find out for myself. I read it, and I just don't know. Someparts were very good, and the pages flew by,but there were other parts, where I just wanted to call it quits.Susie is a 14 year old girl, who one day on her way home from school, is lured away by a neighbor. Her parents beginto worry and as time goes by, all that is recovered is an elbow.After a decade, her parents give up hope of finding her alive.This book goes on to tell the stories of the way Susie's deathaffects her friends and family. But after that the story gets a bit unbelievable, and I couldn't wait for it to be over.In my opinion The Lovely Bones is worthy of a 3.5."
3,mediocre,"I found this novel a bit aggravating...the characters made me very angry. I had heard good reviews but once I read it myself I felt like I was lied to. I found that how she spent her time back on earth awful...this book leads you up to nothing...and what happens to the ""bad guy"" sucks...some of the plot was good and interesting but other than that it was just o.k..."
4,Not For Mothers,This book is captivating from the start. Alice Sebold's descriptions of Susie Salmon's life allows the reader to dive into the book and become part of it. The journey Susie takes through this book gives insight to Sebold's ideas. Personal heavens and lost emotions are a couple of the main themes. I wouldn't recomend this book for mothers because of the tragic death of Susie. In fact I won't let my own mother read it.
2,What does Sebold know about heaven???,"It was a struggle to get through this bookas it's very disturbing and dangerously depictsdying and heaven in a way that is very misleading.If one believes in heaven, then by default, onewould believe in God, and also the Bible. For peoplewho are confused or seeking answers abouttheir creation, dying and heaven, she has dangerouslyimplied heaven and dying as something other than whatit is. I understand that this is a work of fiction, butnothing would lead a reader to believe that this is a work of science-fiction. Some readers may be okay with the rape and dismemberment of a young girl, as for me, it's an unfortunate reality for few and the rest of us should not deem it entertainment. I'm giving two stars because it does portray a good account of what effects a loss such as Susie's might have on her family and even people she hardly knew, such as Ruth."
2,Intriguing story concept but deflates mid-way through,I am listening to this book on cassette and I'm not going to finish it. It has been dragging on since cassette 4 (out of 8)and I couldn't believe that I had that much more of the story to plod through. Sebold's writing is very thick and beautiful in points but it felt like the purpose of the story was diluted after the mid-point in the book. I'm glad I'm not alone in my thoughts about the boredom brought about during the back end of this book. Reading the other reviews made me decided that I will put The Lovely Bones down and return it to the library and pick up another one of the titles I have in the wings. I don't want to waste any more time.
4,Bones...,"I liked this book, but felt disappointed at the end. It gave me a creepy feeling for some reason. They never really resolved the family's need to find her bones and I expected there to be more. It bugged me. Forgive my lack of great explanation, I'm not feeling particularly intellectual/smart today."
1,Didn't live up to the hype,"I read this book after many recommendations (from friends who have the same taste in books that I do.) and found it almost unreadable. None of the characters held my interest at all. I kept waiting for the book to get better, but sadly it did not. I am still wondering what so many people see in it. I had to skim to end it was so boring."
1,A disappointment...,"I was so disappointed in this book, after all the publicity! I love crime stories, but this one falls into some other category entirely. There's nothing compelling about this story, and the unusual plot device of having the dead girl narrate it wears thin early on. I gave up and never finished it."
