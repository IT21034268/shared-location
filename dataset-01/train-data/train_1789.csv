4,Presto 04820 PopLit Hot Air Corn Popper,"This popcorn popper really works! And it's quite fast.The only real issue with it is that it pretty much always throws some popcorn kernels beyond the bowl. But it is very good in every other way.Of course, as others have said it would be nice to have a switch so you wouldn't have to pull the plug to shut it off. But that said, I'm glad I bought it and it has become popular in our house."
4,Poptastic,"Works great and pops fast, which lets me stuff my face with delicious popcorn that much sooner. Tastes better than microwavable popcorn and you get far fewer unpopped kernels. Because you are popping these Bad Larrys with hot air, you won't end up using a lot of unnecessary oil or butter.My only complaint would be the lack of on/off switch; If this sucker is plugged in, it is running.*Side note - you can totally roast coffee in this mofo, too.Enjoy!"
4,Great Popper,"We've used this popper for a month now and it always pops big fluffy kernels and leaves only a couple unpopped kernels. There is only one thing I would change if I could; the butter melter. I wish it had slits in it so the melted butter would drip on the popcorn as it pops in to the bowl, like the popper I had as a kid did.Overall, this it a great popper for the $ and I would definitely recommend it!"
3,Watch out at the end,"The PopLite does a good job of turning out a full four quart yield of popped corn (and then some) from the half cup measurement. However towards the end of the popping cycle, things start to get out of hand. Burning hot kernels and popped corn come flying out of the chute and richochet around the room. Keep kids and pets AWAY towards the end. Also when your bowl is filled with popcorn, the remaining kernels eject into them with such force that the top of your just-popped batch flies out everywhere.The only halfway decent way around this is to make a tent around the sides of the chute with a dishtowel while the last kernels are popping out and be sure to stand close to the plug so you can yank it out when it reaches this frenzied stage. Don't attempt to pick up unpopped kernels from the floor as I did (and there will be quite a few, no matter how careful you are) as they're burning hot. If you can live with all of this, it does make decent popcorn."
5,Best I've used,"Trust a guy who eats popcorn every day - this is the one. Yes, you may get a stray kernel or two at the beginning and a few more at the end. This popper is much better than the others I've tried (3 other models).This one also creates fluffier popped corn than average which is nice.It's available for even cheaper at a certain retail behemoth that starts with Wa."
4,"Delicious, light and fast","The Presto popper is a great addition to my kitchen. It is light, fast, and consistent. Some kernels can fly out un-popped but keep the bowl close to catch them all!"
1,Bad,"This is awful. There is no way to keep the popcorn from going all over the room. I had it as far back on the counter top as possible, but it still goes all over the floor. The kernels are hot, so be careful. I gave it away....with a warning. Very noisy too."
2,"Makes ""chewy"" popcorn","I bought this air popper due to all the 5 star reviews, yet am disappointed in the texture of my popcorn. Everything about this machine is fine, but half my popcorn is unenjoyable due to it being ""chewy"". I've tried other brands of kernals, but it comes down to the popcorn being air popped...it dries out the popcorn after it is popped or something. Does anyone else have this issue, or are you just not as picky about your popcorn? I like my popcorn to ""melt in your mouth"" after the first crunchy bite. Cooking it with this popper however, flattens and compacts it into a small hard bit comparable to cardboard. I never had this problem cooking the kernals on the stove top in a big pot."
2,Disapointed!,"So many good reviews, but I was disapointed with this popcorn air popper.I bought organic popcorn from Trader Joe's which is a great popcorn.But in this popper it looked good, but went flat when we started eating the popcorn!It was Chewy, full of air, and did not have that crisp bite taste like the movie popcorn,orthe other type of popper that cooks on the stove.Soooo Chewy it stuck to our teeth!I returned this Poplite air corn popper.I'm now thinking of buying the one that I would put on the stove, and turn the handle thatAmazon sells."
1,Peice of C,I had another make of air popper for decades until the motor wore out. I assumed they were all the same. I assumed wrong. To get a big bowl of popcorn you have to stand there and do 3 batches. And is easily burns the popcorn. I would never buy this again and am going to look for my order to return it.
1,Don't buy it!,"We bought one of these about 2 weeks ago, and had to return it the next day for a burnt out motor. The next one we got it exchanged for burnt itself out after about 3 bowls of popcorn.My recommendation, don't buy this popcorn popper!"
4,Good for the money,Does the job and does it quickly.Lacks a power switchEasy clean up - but take care - the plastic is a it flimsy
5,excellent,This popper really exceeded my expectations. It pops a full batch in two minutes or less with very little unpopped kernels. Unpopped kernels are really unpreventable since popcorn is flying everywhere with the hot air and all. Noise level isnt too bad either and its pretty easy to clean and store. I love this thing
2,Works great for about 6 months...,The popcorn popper worked perfectly until it was about 6 months old. It wasn't dropped or beaten or...and now it's dead as a doornail. This is the second one we've replaced in a year. I wish these weren't made to be disposable. What a waste!
4,Excellent popcorn fast!,"This popper works as advertised! It makes a large amount of popcorn super fast! It is very easy to operate: dump in 1/2 cup popcorn, plug it in, catch the popcorn in a bowl."
4,Serves its purpose,"My husband and I have been incorporating a healthier eating lifestyle and he gets the munchies at night. So I figured I would buy a hot air popper to get away from the all the microwave crap. I bought this along with some organic popcorn and it was delivered today. I wanted to try it out, so I just put a little bit in. It did spew out some kernels while heating and then again during the popping process and left a few unpopped. No biggie. Try some organic coconut oil in lieu of butter and you have a tasty, healthy snack."
5,My husband's favorite,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He loves it. He makes his own popcorn a lot, and adds his own toppings and flavors. The best is when he combines Parmesan cheese and brewer's yeast. It sounds gross, but it is yummy."
4,Makes very good popcorn,Have used it several times and it has popped all the kernels. I don't use the butter melter feature except to measure the amount of kernels. I just melt what butter I want in the microwave and add it later. Popcorn tastes great.
5,great purchase,"Easy to use, makes great popcorn. I had read reviews of different popcorn makers and this one came out on top. The reviews were right. It's exactly what I wanted!"
4,Works as advertised,"The Presto PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper works just as advetised. We have used the popcorn maker five or six times so far and it has worked great. The butter melter on the top even works, which I never thought it wood. It pops almost all the kernels leaving only one or two unpopped. I would recommend the Presto Poplite to anyone who likes popcorn."
3,Not Disappointed,"I bought this to replace my 25 year old West Bend hot air popper that finally stopped heating. It works OK (not as well las the West Bend), leaves a small amount of unpopped kernals (many pushed into catch bowl) but is a good value for the price. Much prefered over the $80.00 + enclosed models that were also available."
5,Can't beat a Classic,This is the second popcorn popper I bought after buying one that looked really cool however was terrible at making popcorn. While this look like a popcorn popper my Dad bought twenty years ago it works flawlessly and pops nearly 100% of the kernels quickly with no mess. Do yourself a favor buy this popcorn popper first
4,Works just as well as any popper I've had,Works just as well as any popper I've had. Works just as well as Orville Redenbacher Presto but for half the price.
5,Daughter-in-law,Bought this for my Daughter-in-law. She loves it and uses it often. It is a healthy way to eat popcorn.
5,This thing is amazing,"We love this popcorn machine,! We use this daily with Braggs liquid aminos sprayed onto it,great healthy snack and the kids love it."
5,Healthy and tastes great too,"Ditch your microwave popcorn for the fresher taste and healthier quality of air-popped popcorn. I had one of these for years, wore it out and had to purchase this one as a replacement."
5,it works .... (so far),got this yesterday... used it only twice.... it works as advertised and i like it ..... will update this review if anything goes wrong in the future ....
5,Hardly an unpopped kernel!,It does what it's supposed to do. It popped the corn and left virtually no unpopped kernels. Worked great! And it was cheap. What more could you ask for?
4,works great,"I'm happy with the product. It works fine and I use it weekly. If I needed a popper, I would recommend this one"
5,presto popcorn popper,"i love this hot air popcorn popper! it pops popcorn super fast and the popcorn is delicious! i melt my butter on the stove and pour it over the popcorn in layers and mmmmmm its good!!!! i used to own an older model of this popper and when it stopped working after 25 years, i searched online for the same model and came up with this one. i wasn't sure if it was going to compare to the one we had but it does! i love it!!"
4,Great Popcorn Maker!,"I bought this after reading the great reviews here on Amazon.com and must say I love this popcorn machine. It's quick and easy to make popcorn and much healthier than microwave popcorn. If you eat a lot of popcorn, I highly recommend this machine. When the machine starts it's kind of loud and some of the seeds are hot and shoot out of the machine (I wish the dispensing chute were longer), so be careful (especially with kids and pets). All the seeds are popped and you can add butter with the measuring cup. A great buy if you love popcorn!"
4,Air popin,Not much has changed with this thing. A must have product if you enjoy homemade popcorn on a regular basis. Keeps you regular as well.
2,Went Back To Using A Simple Popper,"Recently I purchased this unit at a local store to replace my ca10yr old, inexpensive, Nordic Ware microwave popcorn popper. Probably because of overcooking during those years, the inside bottom started blistering. I decided that to keep using it in this condition might not be a good idea.The only complaint I have about the PopLite popper is the tough texture of the popped corn. I tried using a more expensive brand of popcorn, but that didn't help any.Have boxed up the air-popper, and purchased another Nordic Ware microwave popper. The microwave popper doesn't pop all the kernels, but it's popped corn sure tastes better."
2,Creates a mess when used,Wish this was designed such a way that the pop corn fell straight into a bowl. Some of the pop corn spills all over and makes a mess.Also there is no switch to start and stop it. One has pull the cord to stop it.
4,"Mm, Mm, Mm!","The popcorn it makes tastes really good (although you might want to add some salt and butter from time to time), and is never burnt. It's a great gift for popcorn lovers! The only problem: it is really loud, so be sure to make popcorn before you start a movie."
1,Cheap motor,To be fair I use this popper almost daily. The first one lasted about 6 months before the motor burnt out. I just replaced it last month and the motor burnt out already after 2 weeks of use. That is ridiculous! I will now purchase another brand.
1,Disappointing,I had this popper for two weeks and it started smoking. Had to throw it away. Big waste of money.
1,Junk,This is the worst product out there. I'm throwing mine out instead of returning it because it's better it be in a landfill then in someone's kitchen. The amount of unpopped popcorn it throws out the chute is ridiculous
4,"Cosmetic Damage, but Works As Advertised","This was sold as being in new condition, but arrived with a cosmetic crack in the yellow plastic piece that holds the cover. Besides the crack, we are happy with this popper. It pops quickly and doesn't burn the popcorn or leave too many unpopped kernels. One annoying feature is that there is no off switch. To turn it on and off you have to plug and unplug it from the electrical outlet. When we do this it creates a small electrical spark - not ideal. The manufacturer should add an on-off switch.We used microwave popcorn bags before getting this air popper and this is much better. There is nothing to throw away, you don't have to listen for when the popping slows down to avoid burning the corn, you can add whatever flavorings you want (or none) and it is cheaper. Plus, our 3 year old son really enjoys watching the popcorn come out of the machine and he can't do that with microwave popcorn."
4,Air Popper,"This air popper is great, and arrived within the time expected. Makes a nice big batch of healthy snack popcorn. Only negative, and as one would expect, is the plastic lid gets hot and you need to take care if making a second batch before that cools."
2,knife Sharpener,When I first used this unit it worked fairly good now the fine wheel vibrates. The knives don't get sharp anymore I have to hand sharpen them.
3,Not bad. Could be better.,"For the money, this isn't a bad knife sharpener. However, I have a nice set of Wusthof Trident knives, and this unit seemed to be a little two harsh on some of the blades. On one knife in particular, it left circular patterns running down the blade. It was not pushed down on through the sharpening stones. Oh well, aside from the cosmetic looks, the blades did come out sharp."
3,Sharpens ...HOWEVER...,"I would rate this 3 of 5 stars ONLY because there is excess vibration when the sharpener is turned on and running on the counter...BEFORE the knife is sharpened. I assume this has to do with the eccentricity of the stone sharpening wheel. This product is relatively inexpensive and made in China. You get what you pay for, regardless of where it is made.On the positive side, it does a fair job of sharpening straight knife blades.I'll keep it, but I don't highly recommend it.LTG"
5,Great kitchen necessity,"Directions were easy to follow. It gives old knives a new feel, it works very well. It doesn't clutter up the counter, it is not an eyesore at all. I'm very happy with it!"
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"This is an inexpensive and reliable knife sharpener. It is a very good buy, and I have had no problems since I purchased it."
5,it just works,"Right out of the box it just works great! Having three little critters running around it's hard enough to keep knives out of their hands, let alone keep them sharp enough to be safe. So, I bought the first one Amazon showed me, and it was perfect. It seems really hard to get this one wrong, and I'm used to the boy scout way of finely angling the blade and sweeping over a tiny hand held stone. With this, you simply slide the blade through the two slots on the left to sharpen both sides, then the two on the right for fine cleanup. One word of caution, follow the directions and don't dwell too long - you might grind off too much blade."
2,Presto 08800 Sharpener,This product does not sharpen knives very well. I would have better luck with my hand held sharpener. It stalls out easily and does nothing for cheaper knives.
2,Disappointed,"Got this in the mail hoping it would sharpen better than my manual limited skills, only to find out after practice I could sharpen them better with a stone than this. I am about as amatuer of a knife sharpener as it gets. I have sharpened walmart knives and more expensive knives and the end result is: This does a poor job. Unfortunately I chalked it up to inexperience but it's just a cheap sharpener. I'm not sure how it gets such positive reviews. I believe a pretty ignorant person should be able to buy this, put their knives in and they should come out sharp as new (or sharper). This did not achieve that desired result.I would not recommend this. It sits in the cupboard."
3,"Good, but not spectacular","My kitchen knives are now slightly sharper after using this product, but I was expecting spectacular results based on all the high praises and reviews here on amazon. Also, the sharpener ruined the tip of my paring knife -- I couldn't figure out how to hold the knife to correctly sharpen my for-inch paring knife. Overall, I'm slightly disappointed by the results."
4,Quick. Easy. Works well. But don't expect to shave with your kitchen knives,"Pros:- Quick - 15-30 seconds per knife- Easy to use - slide the knife twice, through each of 4 slots- Works well - knifes are noticeably sharperCons:- gets knives sharp, but not super sharpMy dad sharpens knifes by hand and can get them so sharp you can shave your arm with it. But it takes him 15-25 min per. This product won't get your knives sharp enough to shave. But it works well enough and quickly enough - and you can sharpen all of your knives in 10 min, vs an afternoon."
2,The Forever Stopping Grinder / Presto Pro EverSharp,"The Presto Pro EverSharp, electric knife sharpener isn't what I expected for my money. Ever time I try to sharpen a knife the grinding wheels stops with any type of pressure the knife puts on it, you must hold the knife ever so gently against the grinding wheel or the wheel stops completely and it takes too long to sharpen one knife and even then the knife isn't as sharp as you hope for."
3,You get what you pay for,"A very average sharpener... I got the knifes to a little better shape than they were before but nothing comparing to what they were like when they were new. I'll probably keep it as it is relatively inexpensive and may keep the knifes in decent shape in between the professional sharpening, but I wouldn't recommend it as being even nearly close to what they advertise."
4,Great Value,"I know there are sharpeners that can cost you a lot more then this, but for the everyday use of having to keep your knifes sharpened they work well for the money."
5,FIRE HOUSE TESTED,"Firehouse tested and approved, keeps our knives in the kitchen sharp and ready for heavy use. Bought one for home too"
4,Presto 08800 Knife sharpener,"I purchased this knife sharpener to replace an old one that cost five times as much. After using it every day for the past four months, I am completely satisfied. It performs almost as well as the expensive one and if the motor was a little stronger, I would have rated it five stars. I was encouraged to buy this unit after reading a review by someone who had used it for over a year and was very happy with his purchase."
3,Works good but not for us.,"We really wanted to like this after reading so many positive reviews! However, we decided way to much blade is ""shaved"" off when you are sharpening it. Maybe it's just the type of knives we have, Chicago Cutlery Insignia2. Works for some, just not for us."
4,Cool,"I do like it a lot. It works really well on my cheap knives that I don't really care about, but I'm not sure I would use it on my expensive ones as it does shave a pretty good amount off of them."
5,Great knife sharpener,Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife SharpenerLove this sharpener. It's really small and compact. It sharpens first a rough cut and then you run the knife through the final finishing cut. Nice sharp knives. Good product. It's a keeper and the price is fair.
5,"fast, easy to use, & accurate","It never occurred to me to buy a knife sharpener, but I got this one as a gift several years ago. I had previously always sharpened knives the way my dad did-- on one of those sharpening stick things. Using this was a revelation. It's quick, easy to use, and best of all sharpens my knives perfectly. I don't use it every time I use a knife (Please! Who has that kind of time?) but I probably use it on my favorite knives every couple of weeks depending on use. I'm always amazed at how much difference a sharp knife makes!Highly recommended!"
5,BEST SHARPENER,This sharpener works great. It sharpened all my knives sharper than brand new. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality sharpener for a great price
4,Not bad,"I haven't been able to find the ""knife sharpener guy"" at the hardware store anymore, so I bought one of these to clean up my cooking knives. It's very easy to use, but a little on the loud side. After several passes on the sharpener, my nearly rounded edges came out quite sharp. I could probably get a sharper edge by hand, but who has time for that? The fact that my previous knives were so dull proves I wasn't doing it.This came at a great price, and I was so happy with it I bought one for my mother for Christmas. And she loves hers, too!"
4,Sharp Knifes!!,It does take a bit more metal off than I would have thought but damn are my knifes sharp!!!!! Love the product for the price.
5,Awesome!,"This is the best sharpener I have ever bought. I used to have a Chefmate but I found that this is a much much much better sharpener. They could have charged twice as much and I still think it would be worth it.Protip: Read the manual and follow the instructionsWorks great for kitchen knives, not sure about others."
5,Brought my kitchen knife block and fillet knife back to life,"I am very pleased. This sharpener put a great edge on my trusty day-to-day kitchen knives as well as my fish-cleaning fillet knife. Fishermen know the importance of a sharp fillet knife, am I right? Don't over spend on this piece of kitchen hardware. This sharpener is totally effective and priced right."
1,Not worthy of the Presto name.,I consider this money thrown away. The motor would stall out and would not sharpen any of the knives I tried. I was not applying hard pressure either. Sad excuse for a knife sharpener. J. Nettles
5,Knife Pleaser,"This product is an easy way to sharpen knives. It's very simple, anyone could do it! It makes knives able to cut through paper with ease. I wouldn't recommend keeping it plugged in because it makes a vibrating sound."
4,It works,"Good product for the price you pay. I like this one. Its quiet, it sharpens any king of knives and it works too."
5,Electric knife sharpener,After reading the reviews I bought this for my grandsons wife. Very heavy so it should be a very good one.
2,Sharpened the same knife 3 times...,"Maybe I'm doing this wrong, but I haven't really been able to produce a really nice fine sharp knife since I got this thing. It does sharpen the knifes a little bit, but I'm thinking about taking the cover off so I can better angle the knife to get more gusto out of it. If I do, I'll update this review with results."
3,Faster and a little better.,It takes less time for a somewhat better edge. The most noteable difference - I am able to slice tomatoes more easily.
4,Works very well considering the price.,"This unit put very sharp edges on all of the knives I have tried. Negative comments I have read about the strength of the motor are wrong. If you push so hard that it slows the motor, you are putting way too much pressure on the knife. One need only gently and slowly draw the knife through the guides to create a very sharp edge after several passes."
5,PRESTO PRO ELECTRIC KNIFE SHARPENER,"This product does what it is intended to do, and does it quickly and efficiently. It produce an almost ""factory"" sharp knife. I resharpened all my Japanese knives, including a traditional single bevel deba, and got excellent results. This is a 100% better method than sweating over sharpening stones, and gives close to the same result. I am more than satisfied with this well made, reasonably priced sharpener, and have recommended it to my family."
3,electric knife sharpener,Does the job but the blade slot is so wide that the grinding angle is poorly controlled. Finishing wheel seems overly coarse.
5,Great Sharpener,"This is the second sharpener of this type I bought through Amazon. This second one is a gift for a family member. The first one was for myself and I was so impressed with it, that I decided it will make a great gift for other family members who need to sharpen knives from time to time. Great product!"
5,Value for your money,Very pleased with this unit. Have had others over the years but this one is the best. Very easy to use.
5,A Happy customer,"I took a chance and ordered the Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener based on a previous review. I am so glad I did. It is easy to use, directions are easy to follow, and I couldn't beat the price locally. My knives are so sharp now they kind of scare me so I am extra careful when I am cutting anything."
5,Presto Knife sharpener is great!,"I have had a couple of knife sharpeners in my lifetime, but this one is my favorite! it really works. The way the knives lay in the sharpener it makes it very easy to aim and sharpen. The price is quite reasonable, also."
5,6 stars!,"No complains whatsoever. It sharpens knives extremely well, and is a no-brainer to use! Also awesome for converting steak knives into paring knives. Extremely powerful and shows no sign of damage after repeated usages over 3 months (my device is used by the entire floor on campus!)"
5,Perfect!,It does what is says - gets any blade razor sharp with 3-5 passes. My knives are as sharp as they have ever been. Great price too!
2,Good while it lasted,I owned this for about a year. It work great but constant use took its toll. Last week I tried to use it and the motor wouldn't turn. Investigation showed that vibration in the engine had caused it to break two of its 4 mounting points. These are just simple screws into very thin plastic. Thus one of the grinding wheels was touching the internal casing. It must have been coming loose for a while as the vibration had bent the shaft slightly which means the whole thing runs out of balance. So into the garbage with it
3,Get what you pay for,"This sharpener is very quick and convenient to use. However, the stones are very course and if your not carefull youll take more metal off the blade than is necessary. Ive started using the second stage only and completely bypass the first stage because its to course."
4,Knife Sharpener,The knife sharpener I purchased is a good buy! It does all types of knifes and sharpens them very well.
5,Presto 08800 Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener,The price could not be beat for this product. It preforms better that I thought. Just what I needed.
4,Why did I buy Knife Sharpener?,Why did I buy Knife Sharpener? All my knives were very dull. I did not want to keep buying more knives. Very happy with all sharp knives.
4,like it,I like this product. For its price it is exactly what I expected and works well. It is a good quality product and I would recommend it.
5,Works just fine.,"After receiving this sharpener in a very timely manner through Amazon, I spend an hour sharpening all of our kitchen knives and some hunting knives. It worked just fine putting the edges back on. As with any instrument, it required some practice to use properly, but it sharpened the kitchen cutlery as if they had their original edge, and with my hunting knives, well, it put the edge back where I could do the fine tuning with my ceramic hand sharpener. A fine buy!"
3,Seems to do well,Unit does well. Would have had a better rating but the #1 slot on the sharpening side has a bit of bumpy uneveness to it. Could be a fluke and mine is still useable.I would recommend as a buy.
4,nice little gadget!,"let me start off by saying this is a pretty neat little sharpener, it is not like professional sharpening, but hey for the price its a good deal for keeping your kitchen knives fairly sharp, plus the more you use it the better ""you"" get with using it. I only gave it 4 stars because the guides are not a quite the right angle and they are plastic with a little wiggle to them, all in all would purchase again."
4,Good value,"Was tired of trying to fruitlessly use a sharpening steel on several dull knives. I do a lot of cooking and have a mish mash of both good and cheap knives. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on either sharpening or replacing the knives so based on the cost and the mostly positive reviews, I took a chance on the Presto Pro Eversharp. For a change, I actually read the instructions, before starting to sharpen my knives. I began with the cheapest ones and was pleasantly surprised that they actually regained some type of edge after years of use, dishwashing (I know!), and neglect. It was a simple process to use the coarser grinder first and the hone with the finer grinder. My better knives also benefitted from this machine. Very pleased with the product. It's a good value."
2,Everdull unless you want to do more work.,Got this sharpener as a gift just recently. Was looking for something to sharpen a few knives quicker than using a stone. Well I have to say it works to get the edge ground but the fine wheel is way too course. I sharpened my pocket knife per the instructions and it has a good rough edge at a good angle but now I need to work it with a stone to finish sharpening it. If I have to use a stone to finish what was the point of the sharpener. My recomendation is the sharpener should have a much finer finishing stone. It is a good product for getting a knife started but not for finsihing.
5,No more dullness,My wife and I love this thing. We sharpened every knife we could find in the house. This electric sharpener is worth every penny.
2,How did this get such great reviews?,"This is one of the worst sharpeners I've ever used. Just about any pressure at all stalls the motor, so it takes a lot of patience to sharpen any knife, and in my opinion a novice with a stone can do a better job. As a matter of fact I got one of those tri stone sharpeners here and was able to do a better job on a knife in less time. I also have one of those very simple sharpeners that you just scrape down the blade and that does a better job in less time."
1,Don't bother with this lemon,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this sharpener over the Thanksgiving Day weekend thinking it would sharpen my Henckel knives. However, after reading all the directions and trying it on several older practice knives, i've decided to return it after it ate through my knives and/or making the knives duller than I thought possible.Until they come up with a better electric sharpener or I choose to purchase the expensive Chef's Choice M130 Professional Knife Sharpener, I guess I'll be returning to my whetstone."
5,Love it!! Nothing better than being able to keep your knives sharp!!,"Used correctly, this is an excellent sharpner for the cost. Just make sure you read the instructions, and do not use too much pressure when sharpening your knives or you may end up with a nub. It even keeps my serrated knives sharp."
5,I love it!,I needed a knife sharpener and this is the one I chose. I am thrilled with it. I sharpened every knife in my knife block and what a difference! It's easy to use and does a great job. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a good knife sharpener at a reasonable price. My knives will never be dull again.
4,great sharpener,"Great knife sharpener. After using cheap sharpeners and a sharpening iron for years, and putting up with dull knives, I finally spent the money for this little jewel. A few slides through the sharpener and your knife is really sharp. Should have bought this years ago."
4,works well,"for the price this is a good product , stones are a little course but edge can be cleaned up with a steel very easly ."
4,A good buy for the money,Used it and saved me money over sending my knives out thru the hardware store..good as new.
3,Too soon to say,"I have to say I'm a little disappointed with this machine after all of the positive reviews. I've sharpened my knives 3 times and they're finally starting to come around. Maybe it's the quality of the knives (Farberware Professional) and not the machine, but I must admit I was hoping for more. I've since bought a nice Dexter-Russell V-lo that I like a lot so I have a basis of comparison. I will continue to sharpen and update as I go, but for now, I'm a bit disappointed. We'll see how they compare over the next few months."
5,presto eversharp electric knife sharpener,this is a very good product. all of our knives were so dull they wouldn't cut a piece of paper. after using this they are all very sharp.only have used it once on knives.so am not sure yet if it wil work as well after a few uses.
3,Good sharpener for the price.,"Does a good job of sharpening, but motor will stall if you apply some pressure. Just pull knife through without any downward pressure and it will do a good job."
5,Works Well,Simple to use and did a very good job on all my dull knives. Very happy with the purchase and would certainly recommend to others.
5,Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener,Extremely happy with this knife sharpener. It is easy to use and has improved my knives drastically. I would highly recommend this sharpener for for its price.
4,Great Purchase,"I gave this knife sharpener as a Christmas gift for someone who uses knives to clean fish.He loved it and has told me that it works ""quickly and does a great job"" on not only his filet knife but also their everyday knives.I would recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for an item like this"
5,Knife sharpener,"I like very much, I have used it on all the knives in the house. Works really good and I would buy another one."
5,great knife sharpener,this knife sharpener works great I'm very happy the way all my knifes turned out nice and sharp. I even tried it on one of my $$$$ knifes I was a little worried about doing it but took a big chance and this sharpener worked fantastic on it. I've read some reviewers saying that the motor will stop when sharping well that's because there is to much force being put on the grinding wheels. you only need the weight of the knife against the wheels any more then that the wheels will stop. the motor on this is very quiet running and seems well made this is the best money I've spent on a sharpener.
2,Not as good as hoped,"I have had this sharpener for a little over a year. I was hoping that I would get better at using it or that it would ""break in"" so to speak, because I could never get the great edge I wanted with this. I hate sitting around sharpening my knives on a stone or using leather just to get the cheap kitchen knives sharp again, so I thought this would be faster.Perhaps the grinding wheels on my machine are not matched up to the right angle or something but my knives never get that sharp no matter how careful I am.The basic premise of this type of sharpener is that you use slot 1 to get a good coarse sharpness and then you move over to side 2 to really touch it up. When I use side 1, I get a pretty decent ""file type"" edge on the blade but then when I move it to side 2 it seems to clean up the edge a bit but also leaves it duller than side 1.I'm going to order the accusharp hand sharpener and see if it works better. It's alot cheaper."
3,Good deal for the price,"It seems like it's built well, and I'm sure it got put through it's paces before being sent back out (I purchased it re-conditioned), but time will tell.On first use, I was a little surprised it didn't call for any kind of oil or water to protect the blade, but I'm assuming they know what they're doing. The trouble was, even light, even pressure of the blade to the stone made the wheel grind to a halt. It just doesn't seem like it has enough power.I'll use it on a few more knives and see if it's my problem or the sharpeners, and I'll write again."
4,"Works great. Could use a little more power, but it works great.","Sharpened up our knives as soon as we got it. It worked great. If I pushed too hard, it slowed down or stopped the disks, but when I let up a little, it worked great.Now we have nice sharp knives, thanks to this little devil.Dennis"
4,Good value for the price,Good overall value for the money. Could use a little more horsepower. Does a pretty good job of putting a nice edge on my knives.
1,Give me strength,This product is EXTREMELY under powered. Motor stops very easily during the sharpening process. Don't be lured in by what seems to be a good price. This item is one you should pass on.
5,Impressive,"What a great tool. I've tried sharpening using a steel, and I find I don't have the talent to do it well. I've bought other sharpeners, like the Mouse magnet and the ones on the backs of can openers, but this sharpener is the best of them all.I've got quite a few knives of varying quality (faberware cheapies, and some german not-so-cheapies) and this tool did them all great justice. It even works well on serrated steak knives, you just need to sharpen one side of the knife (one side usually doesn't have the serration marks).Highly recommend to spruce up your dated knife collection, although I would probably be worried about using it constantly on expensive knives, as it tends to wear down the metal a bit faster than sharpening by hand."
1,A Great Way to Ruin Your Good Knives,"I bought this because it appeared to be quicker than the original Chef's Choice I already own, which takes 20 minutes per knife. I tried it on my best Henckels 8-inch Chef's knife. I followed the directions exactly. It left the knife almost useless, duller then when I started. I tried again, with the same knife, then a second Sabatier knife, with the same results. I am now going to send these knives to a professional service to see if they can be salvaged. Complete junk!"
1,Destroys good knives.,"I tested this out only a short while after getting it, I mostly purchased it for conveniences sake having been hand sharpening my knives for ages. I place the blade in the slot and hear the pretty much expected grinding. What I was not expecting was to see the balde geometry of my knife completely destroyed as well as the angle totally messed up. This is an absolute piece of garbage and unless you want your knives to be destroyed stick with hand sharpening or find a better auto sharpener."
2,It is brutal...sharpening or cutting,"I bought this knife sharpener after reading so many positive reviews. Using electricity was also a good appeal to me.When I tried this sharpener with my German knives... the sharpener cut (and removed) so much of the blades. It's not sharpening... it's cutting the blades. Now my German knives have blades brutally damaged by this sharpener. I stopped using this sharpener and put it inside my kitchen drawer.If you're sharpening cheap knives, this is a good choice. Each time, you simply cut more and more of the dull blades to make them sharper. If you want to sharpen more expensive kitchen knives, look elsewhere. Chef's Choice 464 will be a good alternative."
2,"Coarse wheels, chatter...only for junk knives","This thing will not give a precise angled edge because of the wide slot for the blade. The grinding wheels are coarse & if you look closely you will always see, (and even feel it when sharpening) chatter on your knife edge. This will ruin a good knife. This is only good for the junk knives that I use in the garage. Do NOT ruin a good knife with junk like this product!"
3,Product Box in terrible condition - beware if giving as a gift,"Ordered from seller Amazon, LLC. Haven't tried product yet (giving as Christmas gift to someone) but product box arrived completely damaged. There are dents, it is bent in places, scrunched in corners, there's a spot where it looks like someone stabbed it with a knife. It basically looks like someone tried to use it as an accordion.The reviews I read for this product sound like it's a wonderful product to have. However, I'm going to be very embarrassed to give this present in this condition. I'll have to cross my fingers it's not damaged inside. I usually buy products from Amazon, LLC to avoid this all together (though this is the second year in a row Christmas gifts have come in damaged condition).I just recommend if you're getting this as a gift for someone, the box may arrive in very poor condition. I guess on the 26th I'll find out whether it came damaged as well...Disappointing."
4,Works but just ok,"First, the motor is just a bit weak and bogs down a little to easily. Second, The slots are a little sloppy when using thinner blades and require a good steady hand to keep the angle.There is some time needed to get the proper technique and movement down so don't just shove your $200 knife through expecting it to come out razor sharp. I used an old knife that I didn't care if destroyed to practice a bit before I felt comfortable enough putting my good blades in it. It does a decent job especially on big long blades but I actually prefer my manual sharpener to sharpen my small knives by hand and it costs half the price. I did use it to sharpen some serrated steak knives but the results are not as favorable as I would have liked."
2,Not so good.,I already had another knife sharpener but it is hard to keep the blade at the correct cutting angle. I bought this one because it looks like it would be easier to do that. Not so! It also has sharpening wheels that are not as effective as my old one. So I use my old one.
3,Just OK,"I was expecting outstanding cutting from my knife set but I have to say that although they felt much better they didn't perform as well as I thought they would.Since I wasn't too thrilled about it I re-did the sharpening (as per the instructions) with little improvement.Note though that I don't think this item is bad, it really does sharpen the knives and improves over never-sharpened blades. I would still recommend this for someonethat wants to get out of manually sharpening."
2,Not Worth The Price,"My previous review is gone, so I will post again since all the positive reviews are wrong. This will get your knife no sharper than a cheap handheld sharpener. As others have stated, the motor seizes with little pressure. Either purchase the expensive high grade sharpener or the cheap one. This middle grade sharpens no better than the cheap ones."
3,Presto knife sharpener,"I bought it because it was reasonably priced. I have not used extensively yet, but I am not impressed as of yet. Only tried two knives at this point. Will up date latter."
2,Sharpens Poorly,"I'm not sure whats going on here. Maybe I received a bad sharpener with bad wheels. I used this on some old dull cheap knives and it did nothing to improve their edge. I followed directions exactly as it said and it produced very rough jagged edges, nothing close to a proper edge. I tried it again several times to the same effect. The sharpener is now collecting dust. The only reason I didn't rate it one star was that I didn't waste too much money on it. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
5,Blows away the Chef's Choice (300),So for I think this is a great knife sharpener for the money. I had a new Chef's Choice (300) diamond hone electric sharpener and could not get my knives sharp and it scratched up the sides. I was reluctant to get another electric sharpener but after reading the reviews on this one I decided to give it a try since it was less expensive than the Chef's Choice. I t worked great. With four pulls through the coarse and fine sides my knives were razor sharp. I just used the fine hone for the knives I had that were already pretty sharp and they came out razor sharp. Unless your knives are really dull and need a new angle the fine hone may be all you need. I found the best price at Amazon.
5,good,"sharpens good, not razor-like.but for utility- sharpening, it is a stupendous product & bargain. even the fine side is super agressive & will erase any serrations you accidently pass over it."
3,Not for sport knives,"I have a Kershaw Ken Onion Blur, and attempted to use the Presto Eversharp to sharpen it. It was a poor decision.I sharpened a meat cleaver and a Global chef's knife in addition to the Kershaw. It works well for those knives, though the edge is a bit rough for my liking. It sharpens well enough to produce a good edge.While the advertising states that this electric sharpener can sharpen sport knives, I highly recommend against it. Most sport knives are quite thick, and you may not be able to get a consistent edge. Because of the grinding wheel's placement, you may even dull your blade. Take your sport knives to a professional to have sharpened. Otherwise, this sharpener is adequate for most other knives."
4,Great sharpener and easy to use!,The Presto Pro sharpener did a fabulous job sharpening my older Chicago cutlery knives. Had to run a couple knives through the sharpening system twice as they were pretty dull. The results are amazing.
4,A pretty good deal for the money,I've bought some of the cheap sharpeners and they barely work. This one gave a chef knife I have that's always been stubborn a pretty decent edge. The other chef knives sharpened well but not razor sharp and better than using the cheap crap you see for $10.Follow the instructions and for dull knives run through the procedure twice and you'll have very usable knives.
4,does the job easy to use,"it works well, do not be scared of the noise while the knife is being sharpened. Easy to store, does not weight much. Easy to fit in a drawer. overall great product."
4,Works well,"Performed as expected. Some knives required 4-5 passes, the carbon blades were sharp after 3 passes. Light pressure seems to be adequate."
1,Junk.,If you're looking for sharp knives get something else. I've used other electric knife sharpeners before and this one doesn't stack up well. The motor is very weak and I think the fine wheel must be too coarse as after 15 minutes of sharpening with decent knives I could not get a good shaving edge on one of them. My dad's Chef's Choice will put a shaving edge on the same knives in a couple of minutes. I actually think this sharpener dulled the edge of my folder slightly.
1,Terrible product,"Maybe I wasn't using it right, but I don't know how I could have been wrong. I read the instructions and all of the other material that was sent. This product ruined my knife. It was absolutely ruined. I then used a sharpening stone to get some kind of an edge on the knife, then decided to try it one more time. The knife is totally unusable. After reading all the positive reviews I just can't figure out what went wrong."
5,Great,"Great value, works well. Does a great job, one caution do not put a lot of pressure on the blade or the wheels will stop. I had a bunch of knives that had not been sharpened in years it made short work of them."
5,Great product,Thanks to Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener all my knifes are now perfectly sharp. I even sharpened my pizza cutter with it! It is also very easy to use. I am very happy with my new knife sharpener. I already recommended it to my friends.
3,Good for the money,"Good for the money, I would not complain (as others have) that you can stop the motor by pushing down on the knife too hard. If it didn't stop, you would be just grinding away too much of the blade, probably at a bad angle. Once complaint I do have is that the built-in guides cause the blade to sharpen with too blunt an angle. On a hand stone, you would hold the blade up less than 15 degrees. It is, at a minimum, more than twice that on this machine. But, for the price, and because so many new knives have ultra-hard stainless blades, the machine is fine. Those hard blades make hand-sharpening a terrible chore."
3,It works but....,"For the money I don't see buying a better sharpener. It is pretty easy to use but you have to be careful and make sure you are feeding the knife through at the right angle. Yes there are guides that you have to press the blade against, but if you are off you will ruin your knives pretty quickly. Also, knives that are thicker steel toward the handle..like my 8"" Henckles Chef knife are too fat to feed into the machine properly and will get messed up. Why I even thought of using a $25 sharpener on a $100 knife is beyond me. Other cheaper knives that are the same thickness throughout the length of the blade do get sharpened really well....just make sure you take your time. Other reviewers stating the motor is weak and binds are dead on. If you apply too much pressure the motor will stop and possibly damage your knife. For the money it cant be beat, but make sure you aint using it to sharpen high end cutlery."
1,Destroys your blade,"For old knives in desperate need of a completely new cutting edge, this works fine. For anything else, this absolutely destroys your blade. Followed the instructions extremely carefully, using only the fine sharpening side to do some touch up work on some of my Ginsu knives. Literally took an 1/8"" off the blade. You can see the ridge where it slopes in from the back now, as I couldn't get the very last end of the blade through the wheels. My knives have never been the same, I'm probably going to have to get new ones. Take the time to sharpen by hand; your steel will thank you."
1,Is it me or the machine,"I bought this machine due to good reviews. My knifes are more worse than before. It ruin one of my knife. I followed and read the instructions over and over(there's not much to read). I tried to sharpen again and again, and nothing works. Finally, I gave up, and had to return for refund."
2,"Great Product, Why send me a broken beat up box?","I bought this product for my husband for Christmas. I know that the product already works well so I knew it was a good deal. It finally came in the mail today, a day late and when I opened up the Amazon box everything was in great condition but the box to this product. And when I mean dented it looked like someone threw it around and stomped on it. I am so disappointed in the quality I received for a present."
3,Cautiously optomistic,I gave this presto pro eversharp a three star rating because I have only used this product a few times since I have received it and it seems to do a decent job but to me it seems to be lacking the finished touch to the edge.( maybe it is just me or the way I understand the instructions}.
2,Not worth the money,"I know there are lots of reviews for this product. I have a hard time believing the really good reveiws.My expectations were low, but this machine suprised me still. It stalls out frequently when trying to sharpen. Mine shut itself off and wouldn't turn back on after ten minutes of total use. I had to take it apart to repair it. It is very cheaply made. It does its job, but it is extremely cheap.Buyer beward"
2,Go ahead if you want to destroy your knife,"The quickest way to destroy a decent knife is by using this ""sharpener"". Buy yourself a rough (~300)and a fine (~1000 grit) sharpening stones, and the results are night and day."
1,Dull,"Well, I go by alot of reviews on Amazon here, but I disagree with the ones here now, maybe I bougth the lemon, I've had this for a couple of years and have never had a good sharp edge on my knives, I am sure both wheels are the same grit and the the sharpening looks the same on both wheels, I've gone back to using my file to sharpen and in 20 to 30 seconds I can sharpen my knives with a razor edge where this machine only takes the flat spots off."
5,Good Buy,"This knife sharpener is a replacement for an electric knife sharpener I've had, it seems, forever. I cannot tolerate a dull knife. The Presto Pro EverSharp electric knife sharpener seems to do a good job in keeping my knives as sharp as I like. Since I don't let my knives get terribly dull, I have only used the 2nd step in sharpening thus far--no need to take more off than necessary. Truly, I don't understand why more housewives don't have a knife sharpener in their kitchen--we use our knives so often and to be able to keep them sharp for optimum use is a blessing in the kitchen."
4,Henckel Knives,For a long time I have been looking for a sharpener to restore the edge to my Henckel Knives. Thumbs up for this sharpener.
5,Great sharpener!,I bought this sharpener for my Henkle Pro S knives. It was easy to use and got my knives very sharp! Great product!
1,Not even for amateurs,"This was an impulse buy, and as most impulse buys, was not a good choice. I can sharpen knives on stones fairly well, however I bought this contraption, thinking my wife can use it in the kitchen, saving me the aggravation of sharpening her knives. The stones in this machine are farily coarse and because of that, leave a ragged edge. Save your money and buy a decent stone - either water or oil."
1,presto no hardly sharp,"i have to give this one lower scores the knife i have so far have not gotten any sharper with the presto eversharp and 2 of my very good knifes its mest the edge up on the knife ,, so im done using this junk"
1,This must be a joke!,"This is without a doubt the worst possible knife sharpener made. I don't know who left the other reviews, but they must all work for the marketing department of the company that makes this piece of junk. For starters,the plastic housing is so flimsy and poorly made that the only possible result is that your knife will not be inserted at the proper angles for it to be correctly sharpened. When precisely following the instructions, the end result is that your knife is duller than when you started. Secondly, and probably most importantly, the motor on this device is so weak that it cannot take the slightest weight or pressure without coming to a complete stop. It really should be removed from the market. Unless you are only attempting to sharpen a thin bladed steak knife, this device will not have the power to turn the grinding stones. Even if you do manage to keep the stone turning the blade will be incorrectly ground and the knife will be duller."
5,Great Sharpner at a low price,"I had sharpened our knives on a grinding wheel for years and thought I was doing a good job but this makes those knives feel dull. This sharpener gives a really sharp edge very easily. I sharpened every knife I could find! I noticed the difference with our kitchen knives immediately, slicing and dicing is much easier now. As someone noted it you apply too much pressure the wheel will stop but I think that is to keep you from messing up the angle. Just a slight pressure or if it is a large knife the weight of the knife will do it and you get a razor sharp edge. Great product!"
5,Great Price/Product,"I bought this product from Amazon 5 years ago. I have used it on a regular basis since purchasing it. At first some knives needed alot of work but now a couple of strokes on the touch-up side, every once in awhile, and all my knives stay super sharp. One of the best purchases I've ever made."
4,Perfect Kitchen Sharpener,"I needed an effective, yet reasonably priced kitchen sharpener - this item did the trick. I am very pleased with my purchase."
3,"Good, but not great","It sharpens knives, but it appears to not have a strong enough motor. Most of my knives slow it down so much it doesn't sharpen them quickly.However, with patience, it does sharpen them. I have to finish them with steel from my knife block or a stone, but it works well with patience"
4,liked the knife sharpener,"Liked the knife sharpener. Some of our knives didn't get as sharp as I would like, but probably because they are a softer steel. It is easy to use."
5,Nice Sharpener,"I checked a number of reviews for knife sharpeners and chose the Presto. The unit itself was larger than I was expecting. The documentation warned of sparks, I was not sure what to expect. I previously tried another manual sharpener on a few of the knives and dulled them more. The instructions were simple. The process took just a few minutes per knife. I am impressed with how quickly the unit was able to return a decent edge to these knives. I would recommend this unit."
4,Perfectly acceptable to sharpen straight edge knives,"As stated by other commenters, if you pressed too hard to stone will stop. But you don't have to press hard, just enough so that your knife is steady. I have sharpened one cheap knife and one more expensive one and they both turned out pretty good. Beats carrying a knife in your purse to the sharpening shop."
1,Is it a book?,"This book is disgustingly unedited. I also bought another book from him that was ""Kernel Projects for Linux"". They were both terrible books. I wonder whether he (the author) wants his readers to gain knowledge or heachaches."
1,Should Have Been So Much Better,"As a big fan of American Chopper, I was really looking forward to this game.Designing and fabricating bikes. Then racing them. All as a part of a video game.Very, very disappointed.The graphics, action and game play are WAY beneath the standards of both Nintendo and Orange County Choppers.I thought I was playing a Super Nintendo game from over a decade ago."
4,New Young Artist,The music is obviously set in the time of her parents. It harkens to the 60's and 70's. It is well done with interesting back-up that says the musicians are mainly country oriented. She shows potential as a performer. Her voice is clear but she needs more emotion in her delivery. As she matures she will claim her place among the best.
4,Great!,"I got this CD cuz i liked Love You Like I Did, Your Letter, Love Me, and Anywhere. Those are the strongest songs on the CD. The rest of the songs r fillers you can juss skip. But some of the interludes lyke Don't Go Away and the Room 112 intro were bangin! I was surprised they didn't make them into songs. Some other stand outs besides their hits were Funny Feelings, Crazy Over You, and The Only One. Overall this cd is good, but if you're one of those stingy people who don't want to get a cd unless every track on the CD is one and tyte....then just get their singles."
4,this album is tight,"this album is the bomb it will satisfy every single rnb lover in this world. i know even people who like rnb like different people but you will love this album please go out & buy it it so rules songs like anywhere and love me are so good. they bring out classic rnb songs not just ones that u will forget.If your like me u don't like every single rnb song under the sun but this album is so good u will not be dissapionted. Guest apperances r lil kim,mase, and they can carry out the rest of the album perfectly alone"
5,This cd is bangin for real,"Man for all ya'll out there that slept on 112 from the beginning, ya'll are missing out. This cd is better than the first in the fact that the songs have a deeper meaning and there are both fast and slow cuts. It's too bad that these guys aren't in multi-platinum status for both of their albums. I blame that on the radio stations because from their first album only 2 songs got airplay, but that whole cd is tight. I hope the second one goes double platinum, but that's up to everyone out there to go pick it up. Believe me, you'll definitely get your moneys worth..."
5,112 Is The Stuff,I've loved 112 before they became so popular.When nobody else was interested I know they were going to be the bomb from the start. This second album is great and I can't wait to see more from this group.
3,PRETTY GOOD,"THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD CD - I LOVE THE TRACK ""CRAZY OVER YOU"" I HAVE TO PLAY THAT AT MY WEDDING."
4,112 DID IT AGAIN,"THESE FOUR BROTHERS GOIN TO BE AROUND FOR TIME TO COME.. THIS ALBUM IS A TESTAMENT OF THAT .. THEY SHOW GROWTH FROM THE LAST ONE.. A LOT MORE VERSATALITY.. THEY SHINE ON MIDTEMPO CUTS , THE UPTEMPO CUTS WILL HAVE PEOPLE JAMMIN , THE BALLADS ARE GOODFAVE CUTS: LOVE ME, SOME ONE TO HOLD, STAY WITH ME , THE ONLY ONE.. GO PICK IT UP FOLKS YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED"
3,good variety,"The word on 112's first album was that it was ""awesome"" and that they were ""the best"". Working with bad boy really helps the ""word"" I guess. I bought ROOM and I was slightly let down though I fell in love with the last track. The story in the song is heart break and slim really pounds it out. Love the last track. Funny feelins is funny."
4,Room 112 .......their best cd.so far,"This cd from 112 is their best cd to drop yet. I think they did good on the whole cd and you can play this straight through without skipping. I only listened to the cd becasue of the song Anywhere w/ lil zhane"". Then when I started listening I said, this cd is really good. After listening 3 times I had this in the cd player everyday. They combined hip-hop and R+B good on this one. They remade a few songs but most of them are good(and original). The guests all made the cd better and those are some of the best songs. Guests like LIL kim, MJG, Faith Evans, and LIL Zhane make it tight. Thier first cd is nothing compared to this one overall and if you didn't hear it yet.........now is a good time to start. They have thier own style and sound different to the other groups out now."
2,O.K.,"I like 112's first album better than I like this one. I only like really two songs on the album ""Funny Feelings"" and ""Your Letter"". Maybe the next album that comes out they will have more soul!"
4,Theyre gettin good,"Personally ive found the album good. If they were able to get some more hits out of it it'd be a better album. The old album had more hit singles The thing that makes this album stand out is ""anywhere"". The single though is super tite. This album though is a must get, even if just for that 1 single. The other songs though r suprisingly good also......."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED.,"I LOVE 112'S FIRST ALBUM. I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET THIS ONE. WHEN I DID IT DIDN'T DO THE SAME THING FOR ME. I LIKE THE SOMG WITH MASE, ANYWHERE, AND THE SONG W/ FAITH BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT WILL BE COLLECTING DUST. I STILL LISTEN TO THE FIRST ONE OVER & OVER AGAIN!"
1,lack real vocal talent,nothing special about this group.very bland and unoriginal just like there boss puff daddy.
5,Off Da Chain,"The guys in the group, 112, are sooo fine and they sing from the heart. My favorite cuts off the album are ""Anywhere"", ""Love Me"", and ""Love You Like I Did."" They will always be No. 1 in my book. Oh, yeah I still pop in their first cd ""112"" every once in a while. That will still be one of my favorites."
3,Is this 112?,"I'm sorry but this album was not as good as the first one! 112 my group and all, but, they could've done better. The album has some good songs on it such as ""Love Me"" ""Crazy Over You"" ""Funny Feelings"", and that freaky song ""Anywhere"". Hopefully, 112's next album will be better."
3,Not a good use of musical talent.,"Obviously, 112 has talent. But it seems like they just wanted to put out the album, without proofing the final product. Originally, I thought this song had only 2 good songs, ""Love Me"" and ""Your Letter."" But as I kept listening, a few others started to stand out, allowing me to give this album more than 1 star. But this album still falls short of the musical talent that these guys DO have. Smoother beats to accompany their harmonies will make 112 a lot better.Note: The interlude ""Don't Go Away"" sounded really good. I wish they would've extended that into a full length cut."
3,The album was not as good as the 1st one,I bought this album thinking that it was the bomb but was very disappointed although I found a few songs to my liking the others were rubbish. Basically I should have saved my money
4,112 - Room 112,"112 was one of my favorite groups in the 90's group era. Their best work came from this album, Room 112. With the likes of ""Love Me"", ""Anywhere"", and ""Love You Like I Did"", it's hard to argue otherwise. Not only did the record achieve double-platinum sales, but it also established the group as a formidable force in R&B.; Here are the highlights.Of course, the radio hits mentioned above are worth repeat play. But also ""Crazy Over You"" is a dynamic mid-tempo treat, and ""Your Letter"" is a great ballad to close out the album. Also worth mentioning is the interlude flow. Usually, interludes mess up the flow of an album, but on this album, it doesn't. And it makes the listening experience that much more pleasurable.Judging by the quality of music and reception of the public, Room 112 was 112's best album. Shortly after though, things started to change for the quartet. Nothing was more evident than when their next album was released. You knew it was the beginning of the end.Grade: B"
3,Room For Growth & Improvement Is More Like It and Eventually Proven,"Room 112 was a good album, but a lil' bit off the mark of their debut. 112's essence and sound did come out in this album, just not as strong, but I wasn't disappointed."
5,The ONLY cd in my cd playa!!,"I must say that i have been a huge 112 fan ever since the first day i heard their music. This cd is a great one, the kind u can leave on ""repeat all"", and not have to skip any song u don't like. i listen to it all the time, an it's just the type of music u WANT to listen to, the type u ENJOY!!!!"
4,How their music influences love to the fullest,"I think 112 has made a lasting impact on the way I feel about R&B. They have put the passion back into singing. I especially love the song, ""Love You Like I Did!"" That song brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. Thanks for writing a song that appeals to everyone!"
5,get up on a room,"Room 112 is a great c.d. for anyone who likes alittle love in their life! This isn't the first time 112 has proven their talent to us, but this time it really,really shines! With songs like Anywhere that gives the insides on their love making and Love Me featuring Mase your never going to stop this c.d.. There's also songs like The Only One that tells that special someone that their the only one you want and Ain't Nobody that reminds you of that true one that you have. This c.d. is full of great songs and it's a sure keeper for your c.d. player!"
3,All the songs sound alike,"I loved ""Only You"" from the first Cd and this one was kind of disappointing. I still love the song ""love me"" but the rest all sound alike."
3,"Does the job for drip, but limited bean capacity","Quiet, effective grinder, but found that its capacity is a lot less than my previous one. To grind enough for 12 cups, need to do in two batches. Coarse grind, which is OK, so is useful exclusively for drip as opposed for a finer grind such as used for expresso."
4,great grinder for one or 2 people,"really like it. only can grind enough for 2 very large cups of coffee, or 4 regular cups. However, besides that it works great and is a bargain for the price. I use it every morning to grind coffee for 2 cups for my french press....and im enjoying great coffee every morning. Great for a single person who wishes to grind a small amount of coffee every day. Would def purchse it again."
2,Cheap Grinder,"Pros: This grinder is cheap, at only $13.99, and it looked like it could hold about a cup of grounds.Cons: This grinder is a piece of crap; the on/off mechanism is the smallest, cheapest piece of plastic I've ever seen, it will definitely be breaking soon. It doesn't hold enough coffee either; it holds less than a cup of coffee (needed for brewing a 1/2 gallon of coffee).Would not purchase again."
2,Cheap and dirty,I bought this product 10 months ago and I am replacing it with another brand.Things I like: I only need it to grind coffee and it works for that. It is very inexpensive.Things I do not like: The grind is uneven. At the bottom of the jar the grind it is very fine but it stays course on the top so it is difficult to judge. The most annoying thing about the grinder is that the tab to turn it on is not fixed so keeps popping off. The grinder has lots of grooves that collect coffee and so it is impossible to keep clean.
1,BAD PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY,This product broke on the second time we used it. Bad product. Not a good coffee grinder. Thank you for reading.
2,"Electrocutes You, Hard to Clean, but Cheap","Right, so this thing is pretty meh.Good: cheap, grinds things moderately well.Bad: It electrocutes you frequently, rusts easily, and has no good way of cleaning it.I use it to grind coffee and salt crystals. The salt crystals easily cause rust so it needs to be cleaned. If it's not cleaned it clogs and won't rotate-grind. Even without water near it, it electrocutes you.This thing still grinds but with the hassle of getting shocks (always having to unplug it) and that there's no good way of cleaning it, it's fairly rubbish. Only good thing was that it was incredibly inexpensive."
1,Worst seller ever,"I was away for a long period of time and used this grinder only a few times. On the 3rd use it broke, it just so happened the 3rd time I used it was months later. They refuse to have the heart to refund me. This seller does not care about customers sadly, which explains there very low rating understandably. I am actively seeking legal litigation as I gather more information and evidence. They clearly made it clear in the response email that the attitude was tough luck buddy and we dont give a crap. They will be hearing from me routinely as I will not take no for an answer. Also they are completely disorganized, labeling this same coffee grinder as a hamilton beach in one ad and a proctor sylix in others, they are lying even about what they are selling, I am also forwarding this to amazon in hopes of a sooner resolution. No one should buy or respect this joke of a seller."
2,Too small,Works fine but very small capacity. If you want to make more than 3 cups at a time buy another unit.
2,Get the Krups,"I recently bought one of these for a vacation home and own the similarly-priced Krups grinder at my permanent home. I would strongly recommend the Krups over this Proctor Silex grinder. Krups has significantly more capacity, is just as compact, and can grind more finely and uniformly."
1,Poor Design,This coffee grinder is the worst grinder we have had. We use it for grinding coffee. The lid is a poor design -the grinds fall out when the lid is opened and the grinder does not have much power. There is no way to avoid making a mess.....not worth the purchase!!
3,"not bad, not great","for the price it's not that bad, it grinds cinnamon sticks pretty well, but you can't stick whole nutmegs in there and expect powder at all. it's not that sharp to do hard stuff like that. it could do coffee beans but you really have to ""work it."" i'm still pleased with the purchase, i'll keep it for simple stuff and i'll try to get another one with sharp blades for harder things."
1,not for coffee drinkers,"I used to have a Mr. Coffee grinder for 10+ years (the motor burned out when it was used too long). I was strapped for cash, & bought this Proctor Silex for the price.It does NOT grind my coffee beans FINE enough. If you are looking for a coffee grinder, do not buy this one. Get the Mr. Coffee one instead (it's not that much more, http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-IDS77-Electric-Cleaning/dp/B000BRLXUI). It grinds more beans & grinds them finer. The Mr. Coffee one lets you adjust if you want a coarser or finer grind.Apparently it's fine to grind spices, so I guess I'll use it for that."
3,"Does its job, but so tiny","It works good, as long as you only want to grind less than 3 TBS at a time. If you are making enough coffee for a few people, you will be refilling and grinding multiple times, which is annoying."
3,durable,"On the positive side, it's durable, lasted about 5 years so far. For negative, the quality of grind is very poor. No matter what you do, you end up with coffee boulders and coffee dust. Or, if you grind for longer, dust and finer dust. Also, it grinds at a ultra fast speed, so if you hold the button for too long, it'll burn the beans. I've been looking, but have yet to find a real grinder instead of one like this that really chops the beans blender style. True grinders seem to be mega expensive, and all look to be rated pretty low for some reason or another."
3,Ok. As advertised.,"Well built quality construction. Shipper is fast. Coffee bean hopper is a bit small, but for the price, it is adequate."
5,Great Coffee Grinder!!!,"I've had my current Proctor-Silex grinder for 12 years so far. The lid became cracked when a thief dropped the grinder in his haste, but it still works great! I'm purchasing this grinder tonight, just in case the lid on my current grinder does not last due to it's damage. If you need a finer grind, rock it back and forth a couple times and it will grind finer. You just can't beat the price and I highly recommend this grinder to everyone!"
5,Excellent,"This has been great, works well, not to loud, stores away so easy and is a quick clean. I would recommend to everyone, just wish it came in colors"
1,Broken after a few uses,"When I got the grinder, I lovee it. It is easy to use, and very cute. The cord hides too, But after a few uses, it is broken. Very disappoiting."
1,Cheap cheaaaaaap cheap!!!!!,"I used it once and broke down on me!!!! Never gonna buy silex protector again! Ever!It s true,it was cheap,but I replaced it with a better brand that was also 13 bucks....would not recommend it"
1,broke after using it three times!,"So I know this wasn't too much money, but I did expect to get more than 3 uses out of it. I personally don't drink coffee, so I bought this along with a french press for when I have coffee drinking company. Imagine my embarrassment when not only did it stop working, but also sent out quite a large spark when it did work! I nearly electrocuted my boyfriend! So I would not recommend this product at all, spend the few extra dollars it takes to buy a quality grinder. Or buy it for someone that you really don't like and want to give a jolt to."
5,Good deal,"I bought this partly based on reviews, so here's one from me. The one thing some had a problem with was the size and amount you can grind. I agree with the folks who actually like that, since you shouldn't grind all your beans at once in order to keep freshness. The fresher the better for taste, so I like only grinding enough for one use. I like the lid too. Also, the most inexpensive one you can buy and it's good quality. Good things my child."
3,Too small,After wanting to get a grinder I chose this but soon realized it really is much too small if you like strong coffee. But it does have a nice white color and the price is hard to beat.
2,"Works fine, not easy to clean or stow","The grinder is small so you can't grind that many beans, it is difficult to clean, and the cord doesn't wind and unwind easily. If you're looking for bare minimum than this is your machine. You get what you pay for."
3,COFFEE,"So i got this for my husband because he wanted to buy beans and see if they are better then pre ground. Anyway, it works fine but to make a full 12 pot of coffee it is not big enough. He has to grind it in 2 batches. Not a huge deal, but it would be nice if he only had to do it once."
2,Eh,It was great for about 5 months then it fell apart and won't work at all now. Keep in mind I only used it for small quantities of coffee beans 1-2 times a week. Pathetic reliability.
2,great then broken,bought this grinder thinking it would last at least a year. it broke within 3 months. retractable cord and other features don't outweigh that it's actually a cheap grinder. invest a little extra if you don't want the hassle of looking for another grinder soon after purchasing this one.
4,It's a machine,It's cheap and it grinds coffee. I'm happy with it! It's fast and easy to use. I highly recomend this product for grinding coffee beans!
1,BAD,IT WAS VERY BAD. AFTER USING IT THREE TIMES THE MACHINE DIED. IT DID NOT WORK AGAIN THEN I THROW IT AWAY.SPEND MORE MONEY FOR BETTER QUALIYU.
1,Died after 3 months,"This was a great grinder but the motor died after less than 3 months of occasional use. Warranty service requires shipping at own expense to repair center, not sure it's worth it for this item considering the price of shipping."
1,what happened to workmanship,"this was an inexpensive product but it does carry the Proctor Silex name first use the glue holding the grinder button caused the grinder button to fall off...it was not expensive, however, so...go for the higher quality, albeit more expensive quality."
1,Broke after one month,"This product worked well for a month, but then it broke. All I used it for was grinding 3-4 tablespoons of coffee once a day, so I don't think that I overused it or did anything that explains why a coffee grinder would break after a month of grinding coffee. Like another reviewer said, it's not worth the money to pay for shipping to have it replaced with another poor quality grinder. I guess I can't be too upset since it was only $13, but I would have expected it to last at least a year. I was trying to avoid having to buy a more expensive grinder, but now I have to do that anyway and wasted my time and $13 on this. I would recommend buying a higher quality grinder from the start."
4,Peanut butter grinder,My grinder has never seen a coffee bean.Like several others I bought it to grind flax seeds and it does a fine job of that.But I am now using it to make fresh peanut butter too.It takes a while but surprisingly it will actually make peanut butter without adding any oil or anything but the peanuts. There seems to be an optimum quantity of nuts that help the mixture to roll over from the top and back into the blade. A little tapping on the lid from time to time or tapping the whole unit on the counter seems to help.My only complaint is the non-removable blade. If the blade was removable it would be much easier to get the peanut butter out and clean the bowl and blade.
5,Great Product,I love this coffee grinder. It works great and the price is sooo reasonable. I also love the retractable cord.
3,you get what you pay for,"coffee grinder works fine, but the two issues i have are that the electrical cable is only about 8 inches long, and it only can grind about a half of pot worth of coffee. if these two issues are fine with you, i would recommend it."
3,Good enough,"I needed a grinder specifically for flax seed, part of my diet now that I've been diagnosed with breast cancer. This does an adequate job for what I need it for, but I sure wouldn't use if for coffee beans."
2,works below expectations,"Have only had the grinder for a few weeks and there is definitely some issues. First of all there is not a tight seal from the lid and the rest of the appliance, so when you pull the lid out it will always spill coffee grounds on your counter. Also, was using it the other day and it froze up mid-grind and quit grinding for a few seconds, definitely not a good sign. Im not sure if mine is just defective or the product as a whole is just low quality but I am not satisfied."
5,Nice little gadget,Worked just like I hoped it would. I put in some flaxseeds and ground them down so I could sprinkle them on my oatmeal. Love the fact that cord winds back into the grinder
2,You Get What You Pay For,"This grinder is ok for once in a while use but if you use on a daily bases like we do, don't buy.....very small and hard to open, spilling grinds all over and had to reload bc beans did not all fit in and I only make 6 cups of coffee at a time."
5,"Quick, easy, grinds like a charm","I use this grinder for flaxseeds instead of coffee. Grinds quickly, completely and easy to clean. If you've got one of those single cup coffee makers, I would think this is perfect to always have freshly ground coffee without waste."
3,Coarse grind only (but quiet),"The blade on this grinder is not sharpened, so a fine grind is impossible. It more beats up your coffee than grinds it. But it is very quiet. And the cord storage mechanism is awesome design (if completely useless)."
4,So far so good,"I've only used this twice so far but it seems great. It's easy to use, clean and store. I'm using it to grind flax seeds and spices. Have fun with it! :)"
4,really helps out,I have to admit it's better than I would have thought.Plenty of power.I haven't used it for coffee beans yet but I have used it for chopping spices.I was pleasantly surprised.
1,Course Grind Only,"I've owned a number of coffee grinders and this is the worse I've owned. I was attracted to the ratings and the wind up cord. The top is thin and will probably break (I won't be disappointed). I'm a daily grinder and this product doesn't hold enough for an entire pot, doesn't fine grind, and is not worth the money in my book.Back to Krups I go."
2,Top too small!,"Having problems with switch. some times pressing more that once, like to pulse the grind, sets off the GFD and you need to reset to continue. Also the top doesn't hold enought coffee grounds so it's easy to spill some grounds when you take the top off."
1,Too little capacity; uneven grind,"I bought this grinder as a replacement for my Michael Graves grinder which quit after 4 years. I have an old (10-15 years!) Braun which still works well but isn't pretty as a backup. I liked the looks and features of this Proctor Silex & bought it. Too bad I threw the receipt out as after a week we haven't had a good cup of coffee yet. Not only is the top small, but the grinder blades seem to be too high and too straight--Braun is far superior to this, and at about the same price. Mine is going to Goodwill since I threw the receipt away."
3,"Good value for the money, but it is not for gourmet coffee drinkers...","This is a decent product for the money.The positives: start with the low price. The cord can be rolled in and hides nicely. And it works. I made good coffee using this grinder.The negatives: This is for casual coffee drinkers, not for connoisseurs. There is no control over granularity. If you want finely ground coffee, you have to run it longer. If you are into making Turkish Coffee, don't buy this product, it cannot grind coffee that finely. Even if you are OK with not so finely ground coffee, the control is not there. You get some very small pieces, and others larger than desired. You may have to spend up to $100 for a grinder that will grind most pieces at about the same size. This is a low end product."
3,Only grinds coffee coursely - Not for cone filter systems.,"My second Mr Coffee grinder bit the dust, and I purchased the PS grinder from the drug store close by. It was the only one they carried. Unfortunately, PS only provides a course grind. I always use a fine grind with my cone filter systems. I ordered the Krupps grinder from Amazon, and it grinds perfectly for my needs. Kruggs can also handle 3 ounces of coffee beans at a time."
3,It grinds,"I like how the cord winds up back inside the canister. I do not like how you have to keep the button pressed while grounding.But for the price,, it gets the job done."
4,Great value for its cost,"We use this grinder to grind flax seeds.We've been using it daily for the past month and it works great.The only downside we've found so far is that it's small - you can't grind more than 2-3 spoonfuls at a time. Fortunately, we don't need more than that on a daily basis."
4,Reliable little grinder,"I use this exclusively to grind flaxseed for smoothies I make. It works very well and is simple and easy. However, it does not hold a great deal of flaxseed -- just barely enough for my purposes -- and I need to shake it a bit to ensure everything is ground.Also, if you twist the entire top, it wraps up the cord. But this wrapping requires twisting hard, so much so that I just leave the cord out.But, these are minor complaints given that everything else works well and it was cheap."
4,Great price,"Not bad for the price but a little under powered for spices. After a thorough cleaning out of the spices, I found it to do a really good job on coffee. I will seek out a more powerful one for my spices."
1,Not the best grinder,I got this grinder considering the low price but should have spent a couple of dollars more and gotten the other brands.My previous grinder would grind flax seeds and 6 almonds in a 5 sec pulse. With this one I have to pulse for about 30 to 45 seconds to do the same and yet 2-3 of the almonds are not crushed at all. It seems like this grinder has a very weak motor.Am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend this to anyone - not worth spending the money.
1,Sad little grinder,"Doesn't hold enough beans, the grind is too coarse to make strong coffee, and it makes a mess. If you want to make coffee for four people you end up grinding the beans in batches, holding the button down for like a minute to try to get the grounds smaller. Then it stopped working after a week of daily use."
5,Great for less...,"Just received this item and ground a bunch of peppercorns right off the bat. Did just fine. That's all I was really concerned about. Basic, very easy to use, clean, and store (the cord wraps inside)...for a very low price. Can't beat a bargain."
1,Would be ZERO if it was possible.,"In order to function you must push a small plastic piece that doesn't stay attached to the machine. Needless to say, that was lost in no time and the grinder is no longer functional.I have had a similiar grinder for 30 years that never had a problem. The only reason I wanted a new one was for flax seeds (instead of coffee).This was a total waste of money."
2,COFFEE GRINDER,"THIS GRINDER WAS WAY TOO SMALL BUT WAS EFFICIENT. I NEEDED TO GRIND A LARGER PORTION BUT IT WILL COME IN HANDY FOR SOMETHING ELSE...HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT, AS YET!"
2,Broke at first use with seeds,"I wanted to grind some nuts and seeds with this coffee grinder. True, I did not use it for coffee, and it did the job with walnuts so I give it two stars. But it broke down the first time I tried to grind some poppy seeds. I always grind them with a coffee grinder. And it is tiny as well. Will try another one."
4,"Small, but Mighty","The grinder works great. It's quiet and compact. Has a neat feature that wraps up the cord internally when you twist it. I didn't realize just how small it was, but I only brew a small pot anyway. Also, I didn't expect it to make such a mess when I removed the lid. I can't blame this model though, that may happen with any grinder...?I am very happy with the way it works and just open it directly over the coffee filter to avoid the mess."
4,Good for price,"I've used this coffee grinder in the past, borrowed from someone else. I decided to get my own. It works great, only concern was that the little white ""button"" that you press to grind was already fallen off when I opened the box. It snaps back on, but eventually I""ll need to hot glue it on again. Like I said, grinds great, so good value for the price."
2,Cord too short,"As a grinder, this machine works as described.The issue I had was with the cord on this thing. It is windable into the base of the machine, but getting in out is a little tough. It didn't help that the cord is about 1 foot long, and I kept thinking there was more. The outlets in my kitchen are at ""normal"" height, and the cord is too short for me to grind while keeping it on the countertop. I have to hold it up close to the outlet and grind. If only the cord was a couple of inches longer! Or even better a couple of feet longer."
2,What a wimp!,"First of all, the capacity is very small. Second of all, it is just plain weak in the motor dept. It just grinds and grinds and grinds but never gets the coffee fine enough. Do yourself a favor and spend a couple extra bucks and get a Krups."
1,I'm telling you not to get it,"had it for 2 months. Used it once a week. Be careful overfilling it. Last night it started to make a half-muted sound while vibrating a lot. the blade slowed down and it smelled of burning. Not just-bought wearing in burning, this was an overload, too many beans, I had enough I can't take it anymore, the hell with this coffee-grinder life, I'm out! burning smell. Garbage. I'm eyeballing my Proctor coffeepot right now. PS is cheap stuff folks."
2,Not for strong coffee lovers,"I use a drip machine and this grinder does not offer a fine grind. Unlike the Krups grinder, the coffee stick to the metal and is a pain to clean."
2,Irritating lid,The main reason I don't like this grinder is that I find it very difficult to get the lid off after grinding.
4,"It's okay, doesn't grind that fine, imo","Maybe I should have gotten the Krups. My old Krups ground things to a powder if you let it, but I really don't use beans that often, so I went for the cheapest grinder. I think, tho, if you buy good coffee beans, you can grind them up really finely and use less and get a better cup than wasting the coffee on a coarse grind. I may use this one for grains and get another Krups. I lost the old one in a move. I gave this four stars because I like the retractable cord wind-up feature. You just twist the grinder and the cord winds inside.Edited to add: BUT -- one important plus, and another reason I gave it four stars -- this is much quieter than my old Krups grinder was. This is a huge plus if you find yourself needing to grind beans while others in your household are still asleep, or even if you are trying to have a conversation in the kitchen while grinding."
4,A great little grinder!,"I bought this grinder mostly for turning bread scraps into crumbs so that I can then freeze them, & use later in meatloafs & to coat tilapia or zucchini or cutlets before pan-frying. Will also use it for all the herbs I grow... so cannot say how well it will grind beans, but it sure is working great for these other things!"
5,"Small, cheap and works great","It's small and cheap but gets the job done well, evenly grinding things up. I mostly use it for flax seeds and spices. The cup is pretty small so if you need to grind large quantities of coffee I would not recommend this but for smaller grinding jobs I definitely would recommend this. This is the first coffee grinder I have owned so I am not comparing it to anything but I am really happy with it."
3,"Not bad, but....","The grinder is simply not as good as a Krups grinder we own. For openers, the grinder barely holds the beans needed to make six cups of coffee. So much for a 10-cup load. Second, the blades turn at a lower speed than the Krups, so it's not going to produce as fine of a cut.The price/benefit ratio, however, is fine. So for the price I paid, this does the job. If I had to do it again, though, I'd buy the Krups for more money."
5,Excellent spice mill!,I bought this model for grinding my herbs and spices and it works great for that. The best thing about it is the domed lid--no having to scrape the grounds out of the corners. The retractable cord feature is a bonus too.
3,Not too bad,"Doesn't ground that well, don't expect powder as a result, overall not too bad. Nice-looking device though. Has a retractable cord which is useful, but the whole cord is not too long."
2,"weak motor, low capacity","Bought this after our beloved Braun grinder's top broke. Very disappointed in the product. Round and round and round it ground--and the beans were still in chunks, insufficiently finely ground. Not enough capacity, either, so that the semi-ground coffee spilled onto the counter when we opened the cover."
1,Proctor Silex E160BY Fresh Grind Coffee Grinder,"The unit is preposterous. Its power cord is only 6"" long, way too short to reach any electrical outlet. You literally have to plug it into an extension cord to use it. Now I know why it's so inexpensive- it's useless. Stay away from this product."
2,What a mess..,"While this little thing gets the job done as far as grinding up coffee beans, it makes an absolute mess doing it. I usually have two rounds of grinding to get the right amount of coffee for my coffee machine. Just taking off the top gets a good amount of grounds everywhere and doing this twice makes it even worse. We bought this about a month ago when our last one died and I am going to get a new as soon as possible."
1,just coarse grinder,"For years i shopped on Amazon, but this is the first time giving negtive review. This product doesn't worth at all.1. If you want grand beans very thin, don't buy it. I tried 3 mins and still coarse.2. the design is not good neither, when you open the top, grand coffee will spread around on table.Since it costs not much, i simply just not to return it. Now i have to look for another one."
1,Not a deployment grinder,I had this product for 2 months in Afghanistan and it burned out after 2 months. An inexpensive product but still disappointing!
2,could be better,"UPDATE: 12-14-12I LOVE AMAZON! After contacting customer service about my problem and that my grinder broke after only 8 months of use, they shipped me a replacement grinder out. I'm not changing my 2 Star rating for this product but I would give AMAZON 10 STARS, they have the best product inventory/options and the BEST customer service reps anyplace!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this grinder only after reading the majority of the customer reviews and now I wish I would have kept reading and bought a different model/brand. Not only is this grinder too small, it holds approx 1/2 cup of beans, it does not grind the beans fine enough and after only 8 months this grinder died. I am so upset and would not recommend or buy this piece of junk again!"
1,Eh.,I tried grinding up rice to make rice flower. The first load went fine. It overheated and stopped working on the second load. So don't try using it for periods longer than a couple of minutes because it will die.
2,Eh... there's a reason it's the cheapest on Amazon,"If I had more to spend on a coffee grinder at the time, I would have purchased a better-quality one, but for $13... hey, it does its job. It takes much longer than other grinders to get a really fine ground; I've found that shaking it a lot while it grinds seems to help. Definitely don't recommend it if you intend on using it mostly or only to do really fine grinding. I'm also perpetually afraid that yanking out the cord like that is going to eventually break it. It's nice that it has that storage function built in but I much preferred my last one, where you could just wind the cord around the bottom instead of yanking it out and twisting it back inside the machine."
2,Great while it worked.,"We bought this coffee grinder for our office since it got great reviews. It worked well for a few months, but it has since stopped working well, and I suspect it will soon stop working at all. It looks like the grinds accumulate inside the case, and since the screw on the bottom needs some kind of triangle tool to open it, we can't get them out. We have to shake the case into the garbage, roll the cord in and out, and do crazy maneuvers to try to get it to work in the morning. Not recommended for ongoing use."
1,Broke after 2nd use,"After reading the reviews, I thought I was buying an inexpensive but good duel speed grinder that was going to serve my purposes for grinding both coffee beans and dry spices. The grinder is powerful, but the construction is poor. The latch, which must connect with the grinder before the machine will turn on, is glued onto the lid. And not very well. My broke after the second use. I now have to go through the hassle of returning/reordering and being w/out coffee while this gets sorted out. I'm trying a Melita grinder next, as this was a waste of time."
4,"Probably works well for coffee, too!","In our house, its job is grinding nuts and seeds. At that, it excels. It's not hard to clean; its only drawback seems to be that the cord does not retract all the way, leaving about 6"" protruding."
2,VERY DISSAPOINTED~!,"I am very dissapointed in this machine. The coffee maker is awful...the pot leaks when you pour it...the machine itself has leaked on more than one occasion. The toaster portion takes a quite a while, but it does work. I would certainly return it if I had kept the box. Should have invested in a better coffee machine. I thought it would be perfect being small and having the toaster with it...Oh well, live and learn."
2,A few functional problems,"While this toaster lookd great and has nice features like the re-warming setting, I was not happy with a few things. The cord is very short and did not extend far enough to come out of the appliance garage on my counter. The space where the toast, bagel, etc., pops up is very deep and while it might be good for large items, I had to fish an enlish muffin out with a fork because it does not pop up high enough."
3,"Sexy, but some issues...","This toaster is aesthetically very pleasing to the eye, makes good toast from a variety of different breads, bagles, crumpets and the like. Toasting is fairly even, and the toast remains quite moist which is good. So overall I was pretty happy... until... the underside of the toaster started going rusty, the lip where the chrome folds under. This started happening soon after I bought the toaster, and thought it was just surface rust from moisture in the kitchen, but it looks a bit more serious, probably going to see what Krups say about this. I was replacing my Morphy Richards 1950's toaster with a mordern equivelant, but it doesnt look like it will stay in top condition for 5 years, let alone 50?"
1,Beware of Plastic Grinders!,"Used twice in less than 14 months for a pound or so of hamburger. Within a few minutes of 2nd use, the locking collar that holds the disks and screw mechanism in, broke making the whole think useless. Tried epoxy glue but it did not last long. I thought it may be defective unit but another purchaser on had same issue so I think I will look for a unit with all steel grinding portion. Replacement rings available for $9 but they are so thin, I doubt it will last long. Spend your money on a good, all steel grinder!"
3,Opinion,I have problem with electrical parts ( bad odor - something wrong with motor - smell of burnig resin )I return grinder with out any problem for free and received new. New grinder work perfect.
1,Don't buy,Don't buy this product. You can not get spare parts for it as I found after loosing the grinder blade.
2,Amazing They Keep Selling These,"I received this blender as a gift. It was purchased by someone who believed that Krups products are high quality and thought I would like the features. However, this blender is the worst I've ever used. I'm sorry that it is taking up space on my countertop and hope to replace it soon. I suppose it would be alright for someone who only wants to blend powder into a liquid, or liquids only. But, if you want to make a smoothy, anything with fruit, nuts, vegetables and/or ice, this blender (literally) cannot cut it without overheating and taking a very, very long time to accomplish the task poorly."
1,Depressing,"Let me start by saying I have always loved to read. I came across this book in our coworkers' shared library. After finally finishing this book, I can say it is a depressing book about a depressing ""family"" (who hate or are disappointed in themselves and each other). Everyone in this book is depressed! What a downer, I don't consider this fine literature no matter how well written. I was appalled to see these reviews and realize that it is on reading lists for students - what a shame! As bad as Silas Marner, which I remember struggling through in high school. WHY put boring, depressing books on a reading list if you want young people to enjoy reading???!"
1,Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant,"The book was very hard to get into. As one of the books I had to read over the summer, this book was the worst of all. The disfunctional family really worked my nerves. With the crazy Pearl and no good father the book had so many problems I wouldn't be able to explain them all in this little paragraph. GOOD LUCK if this is a book you had to read over the summer. LIFE'S NOT FAIR TO ADVANCED PLACEMENT STUDENTS!"
1,Absolute garbage.,"This book was forced down my throat in High School and while that was quite some time ago, I remember it vividly. This book drags on seemingly forever without going anywhere. The characters are very bland and uninteresting. The story is entirely predictable. Anybody who would call this book worthy of reading must be comparing it to a street sign."
2,Well Written Disappointment,"A very well written disappointment. I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us. I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that. But that's only half the journey. I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent. The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form. Or maybe not. But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution. I love Tyler's work and admire her skill. But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price."
3,Difficult,"I don't think I've ever read a book in which I disliked every character. Every one. I was home sick recently and read the book in one day. Usually I put a book down if I can't connect with at least 1 character or get into it after about 50 pages. Maybe I'm naive; there were glimmers of sympathy for Pearl initially but when she verbally and physically abuses her children... my chest ached. I hated Cody and how he got married. I felt sorry for Jenny most of the book until she really started showing how detached and shut down she was (and abusive like her mother when her daughter was young). I started out feeling sorry for the characters, but then ended up really disliking them. Excellent writing but I felt drained afterwards. Anne Tyler is great though - this book was upsetting for me."
4,A LITTLE HARD TO CHEW,"I am an avarice Anne Tyler fan, several of her books lining shelves of my library. I count on her stories to introduce me to vibrant, eccentric, loveable characters. Also, I count on coming away refreshed and enlightened. ""Dinner At The Homesick Restaurant"" left me with an upset stomach. The Tull family, though fitting the eccentric characteristics, are more morose and unlikeable than any Tyler family I have read prior. Only one seemed tolerable, and he was a pathetic, lonely soul. BUT...Anne Tyler did not shirk her writing duties. All her strong suits of descriptions, dialogue, character developement, flowing prose are intact. The only reason it rated a 4 was for the unsympathetic characters that haunted me well after the read. I believe good writing and Anne Tyler are synonymous, so don't skip this offering. Just be aware it is more maudlin than most."
4,The ever intertaining Anne Tayler,"I loved the honesty of the working class Baltimoriens at that time.She,the Author always touches my heart.Hope to find another one of her works."
4,Thought provoking,"A thought provoking book on how a dying woman refelcts on how she bought up her three children after her husband left her. The characters in this book all succeeded in life professionally but their lives were full of emotional turmoil and seemed to be stunted. The family always fought and could never finish a meal together at the Homesick Restaraunt, owned by one of the sons..."
5,THE BEST TYLER EVER,"I've read, probably, ten of Anne Tyler's books. DINNER does take 70 or 80 pages to get into, but is without a doubt her masterpiece. If getting your emotions moved is your goal and you don't care where they move, this intimate family epic may change your life. As usual, Tyler's uncompromising compassion washes over all of her meticulously created characters. But in this case, there is none of the forced quirkiness which worked in THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST but became labored in LADDER OF YEARS and her current PATCHWORK PLANET. The meat-and-potatoes of this DINNER are the issues we all share--love, sex, death and the meaning of life. There's a life-affirming wrap-up, but for the most part this is a gut-wrenching depiction of the disappointment and emptiness many of us feel when we open our hearts. The life-affirming component is that, as with most of Ms. Tyler's books, it's nice to know there's someone else noticing and expressing these truths."
2,Not very satisfying,"I just finished this book for my book club. It took a while to get into it, then I kept reading, hoping I'd feel better about the characters.The writing and descriptions are great, but overall I was disappointed in the characters and the story. You get to see the characters from different viewpoints, but they never really change. The family members don't see much of each other, and when they do, there's always a disagreement. The end of the book has no real resolution.So I'm thinking, ""What's the point?"""
4,"""This book really teaches a family how to stay together.""","Mrs. Tull is a very strong women that tries to stick with her family no matter what. If I were in her shoes, I would have been gave up!!"
3,My thoughts...,"This book has earned a great deal of praise. I have to say that Anne's use of words greatly impressed me, but I did not really enjoy the story. The charachters did not incite feeling or cause you to like them. If you have time on your hands, it is definatly worth a try."
2,Am i the only one who didn't like it??,"Maybe this just was not my type of book, but it didn't get wrapped up in it and I could definetly put it down and stop reading it. This plot was just ordinary, kept flowing, but there was no clinch to it. I read it for the sole purpous of school, but i didn't enjoy it very much. But if you like to read about the ordinary lives of people, then i guess this is your kind of book."
2,Dull and joyless - Tyler's worst book so far,"I guess I'm in the minority around here, but I found this book tedious and joyless. I didn't grow to like ANY of the characters or care about what happened to them.I have very much enjoyed Anne Tylers' other books and recognize that she is a major talent. Her observations are keen and her prose is flawless, but not even she could bring this family of bickering, simpering and aimless people to life for me.I will confess that I didn't make it to the end -- I listened to the audio version and made it to the 6th tape before realizing that life is too short to waste on books you don't like."
3,Just OK,"This was an interesting book, but not a moving book. I enjoyed some of the characters, but as a whole its a very unhappy book."
2,Dull and Just Boring,"I am surprised at how many people loved this book and found it great. I found that I really couldn't get involved with any of the characters, and worse yet, Pearl was so downright annoying. There was really no story, just skipping from one character's dull life to the next, and I finally put it down unfinished. A total bore. I gave it two stars because I did like the first chapter, but it seemed to die a quick death from there."
4,A family study,"A lover of Mary Tyler, this study portrays the inner workings of what could be any family. Tyler works her magic in building wholly believable characters who muddle their ways through life doing the best only they know how and wreaking small amounts of havoc along the way but also learning.Tyler is the mistress of characterization and innovative description. I would read anything written by her and am going to work my way through her inventory. A Patchwork Planet another good one."
1,Not very good,"The previous washer pump was trashed, so I bought this inexpensive replacement. Unfortunately, it only worked for about two days. Now the water spurts out in sad little fits. I pulled all of the connecting hoses and made sure they were clear of obstruction."
5,Unbelievable,"It is unbelievable that I'm the first person to review this fantastic book. The book itself is also unbelievable in its intelligence, wit, depth, color, interest, and sheer genius. Alan Bennett is one of the rarest minds of the 20th/21st century. If you're a real reader and you don't have this book, you damn well better buy it."
5,Finally,Finally. A book that does justice to the entreprenurial spirit. I've always struggled wtih the fact that the church seems to lag behind the culture by 20 years. Where are the Holy Spirit entrepreneurs. John Jackson is one of them. I love his unique angle on the entreprenurial pastor.Read the book.It'll unleash the entreprenuer within!
3,smaller than regular,"I usually wear size 7 shoes, but this pair is smaller than regular and very tight, I had to return it. It is good if you have very slim feet."
3,Does the Job,"After reading an article that recommended this knife for those on a budget, I decided to buy this. I use it on various items around the house and find that it has adequate strength. It does make it easier cut things relative to a standard knife. However, it would be nice if you didnt have to hold down the trigger to have it cut or if it had a battery option. On the plus side, it does have a saftey switch and the blades are easily removable and thus easy to wash."
1,Same old crappy Holster from Motorola,"I was looking for a holster from Amazon that was different from the crappy one Motorola and my cell phone gave me. Its not, it has swivel and that awful angle to kick it out for FAT people so they don't break there antenna. PLEASE someone make a holster that doesn't swivel or accomodate FAT people. Don't buy this product unless you want to buy a crappy holster they give you for free @ any cell phone company."
3,What happened to the hard backs these used to have?,"In college I used Porta-Desk notebooks exclusively. The hard backs were a great feature for writing anywhere, and the top bind allowed easy lefty writing. Also they were pre hole-punched and the page turned completely, unlike a legal pad, for easy removal to a binder. I searched for these again when I went back to grad school, and am disappointed to find that the product has changed. The hard back that made these a ""porta-desk"" is gone, this is totally cheap and flimsy compared to what it used to be. The paper itself still seems to be decent quality, so I'm using these because I can't find a better all-around notebook that is top spiral bound, hole punched, and has decent paper and perforation. Unfortunately the price now is about double what I used to pay for better notebooks with the hard backs I liked. I wish the old quality were still available."
3,"The Swiss Army ""Big Boy""","While this watch is the ""star"" of my Swiss Army watch collection, it is not my favorite. Here are the pro's and con's on this watch:The Good Stuff: The size is great, and the syle is very refined, it exudes class and taste. It gets extra points for the nearly impossible to scratch sapphire crystal. It is accurate and dependable.The Not-So-Good: With it's great big face, it is suprizingly difficult to ready. The concentric circle pattern machined into the face and subdials causes a lot of glare. The second hand (the sub-dial at 6 o'clock) is nearly invisible. The teeny date window (at 4:30) gets completely lost and NEEDS magnifier window. While this watch is ""manlier"" and ""classier"", I wear my 10+ year old Swiss Army Lancer much more often, just because it is easier to see. If the face of the Maverick II had a matte finish, and the date display was readable, this would be a much more useful watch."
1,This is why I am buying a new one,This taoster is not for you. Had it for a year and suddenly quit working. Also I will not buy this brand in any product that I need .I didn't even try to notify manufacture-you can see I am not alone in getting short changed by Krups.
1,Piece of junk,"Expensive, uneven toasting during its short life-- 20 months, just out of the 18 month warrenty. Our previous GE toaster was still useful after 22 years.We junked it and bought a new Toastmaster for less than the repair would have cost. The Toastmaster is clearly superior, but not great.Regarding the Jaguar-Lucas comment. Right on!! We owned an XKE with Lucas electronics. Krups may be worse."
1,Quit after less than 3 years,"This toaster was adequate for three years. I liked the slim design-- most 4 slice toasters are wider, and we had limited space. However, three years is a pretty short life span for such a product. Without warning, the toaster quit last week. I will not use Krups again."
1,Don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a toaster!,"This is the last purchase I make having forgotten to check Consumer Reports before buying. This toaster only toasts ONE side of the bread! If you turn up the time, it BURNS one side of the bread and lightly toasts the other side. Consumer Reports top rated the KitchenAid KTT570WH 4-Slice Digital Toaster with Bagel, Warm, and Frozen Functions, White, and gave it a best buy rating. Hope this helps!"
1,Unimpressed with Model 287,Model 287 is either a Lemon or very unreliable.Will not toast equally on both sides.Failed 2 times in a 10 month period.Local authorized repair center took 5 wks. to repair.Krups did not have replacement part for repair center.Krups did not offer to replace unit when I escalated.Second failure requesting 'other model' 155 or 156 replacement.Very dis-satisfied with Krups Products & Service.
1,Definitely disappointed,"This toaster worked okay - for less than a year-and-a-half. It just quit working without any kind of warning - no deterioration in its performance - it just stopped working. I know toasters are not known for their longevity, but I thought that spending a little more would guarantee at least a few years' of adequate performance. Unfortunately, this was not the case with this product. I am definitely disappointed in this toaster and will not purchase this model (or this brand) again."
2,"Krups Sensotoast Deluxe Toaster, Model #287 Review","The Krups Sensotoast Deluxe Toaster, Model #287, worked fine for me for about a year and a half. Then, it started requiring longer toasting times in order to achieve the desired results. After less than two years of use, it stopped working altogether. When I asked my husband to look inside to see if there was a loose wire or something, we discovered that the screws holding the bottom plate on are not something the average screwdriver can remove. We took it to a friend's automotive shop to see if he had the proper screwdriver, but even he couldn't remove the screws! Obviously, the consumer is not meant to gain access to the inside of the toaster. There is only a one year warranty period for this toaster, so basically it's time for a new one - after less than two years. I would not recommend this toaster to anyone."
4,Nice Toaster,"This is a very nice looking toaster. It is quite a large toaster and looks good sitting out on the counter.It toasts perfect each time. I have toasted bagels, frozen waffles, bread and just about anything else that needs to be toasted. I have not had any trouble with it not toasting long enough or too much. I love the way that it sounds when it pops up. It has the sound of a quality toaster. I have used Krups products for years and have had many years of use from them."
4,Roger- over and out(of the Byrds),"I have been a Jim/Roger Mcguinn fan since first hearing Mr. Tambourine Man on the radio. This recording finds Roger in his rocking best as a soloist.Roger had been though several band changes since the Byrds finally dissolved.I believe this was his last backing band until the formation of McGuinn, Clark, and Hillman in 1979-80. This material was recorded around the time of Roger's last Columbia record. On this tour, (and also on the record) is Rick Vito. I had not heard of Rick before McGuinn hired him to play on his record. He plays many great solos, and even sings lead on a song. He even plays Clarence White tribute riffs here and there. Rogers voice is better here. On some of the late seventies live stuff he did, his voice was rather hoarse sounding.If you want to catch a transitional period concert of Roger, you may find a place for it in your collection.Fans of Rick Vito may want this DVD too. It was the begining of his career."
2,So-So,"The audio mix on this item is not very good. If you're looking to hear the jingle-jangle of the Ricky 12, lotsa luck. Too bad - not nearly enough video on the Byrds around."
5,horror movies,"Classic 1962 horror film with the lovely and super talented Janet Blair and british actor Peter Wyngarde Very atmospheric, and full of tension, this was a very well done film with a cool and suprising ending. Great quality and sound i bought this cause i had not seen it since i was a kid. i was not the least dissapointed and if you love these old british horror flicks you won't be either.."
4,Very good adaptation of Fritz Leiber's Conjure Wife,"It has been many years since I read the source novel,Conjure Wife, but this film certainly sticks to the spirit of the source. Anyone in academia will appreciate this story of faculty wives advancing / protecting their husbands careers with witchcraft. The film is not without its flaws, e.g. the goofy voiceover introduction about witchcraft, but it is a solid British production. Janet Blair give a strong performance as the ""good"" witch panicked by her husband's disbelief. This film is far better than the Lon Chaney, Jr. vehicle, Weird Woman (included inInner Sanctum Mysteries: The Complete Movie Collection (Calling Dr. Death / Weird Woman / The Frozen Ghost / Pillow of Death / Dead Man's Eyes / Strange Confession)). Weird Woman changes the basic premise too much, but it does have a good performance by scream queen Evelyn Ankers."
1,"Wrong film sent, TWO times!","I've made two purchases for Burn Witch Burn on Amazon.com, and two times I've been sent the right case, with the top of the DVD labeled with the correct movie, and the disk itself containing something called the Nun and the Sergeant. TWO TIMES! I don't even want Burn Witch Burn anymore. Amazon should just discontinue this film until it gets the correct film on every DVD it ships out. Once can just a mistake, twice is irrisponsible. A lawyer would call this bait and switch, don't you think?"
4,You will get the correct disc now.,"HEY!I ordered the MGM DVD-R copy of Burn, Witch, Burn and GUESS WHAT? I GOT THE CORRECT MOVIE ON THE DISC - and, with a good pressing too! Anamorphic wide screen and 2.0 mono dolby digital sound.So, if you love this film as I always have - go ahead and get it while you can at amazon.com."
5,Do You Believe?,"Also known as ""Night of the Eagle"" this film is based on Fritz Leiber's novel ""Conjure Wife"".Norman Taylor (Peter Wynegarde) a down to earth sociology professor is having extraordinarily good luck in his career and life in general. He finds his wife, Tansey (Janet Blair), has stuffed fetishes in every nook and cranny of the house. She knows that someone is out to get him but as with most movies is too dumb to tell him who it is. He on the other hand does not believe in magic. Divesting himself of all dubious protection, does he leave himself to the elements? Well we will see. And the question will be ""Do You Believe?""Conjure Wife by Fritz Leiber"
3,Pretty Good,"Overall a solid movie. The acting is excellent and the story line and plot are good as well. Burn Witch Burn is not a frightening movie, but it is a good movie of the type. The black and white filming is very good. The camera angles and use of shadows captures the viewers attention and enables the actors to get across that the situation is nerve racking to the characters in the play.Some parts of the story remain unexplained which troubles me a bit because I like to have all the loose ends tied up. Why the husband's lighting candles and pouring dirt on the wife's photograph brings her back from the sea is not explained and why the husband would be looking for her in a locked cript is likewise not disclosed.Still, I liked the move and it is worth viewing for the acting alone."
5,Passed the Toddler Test,"My two-year-old toddler did not break these crayons yet--and for that she is much happier, and so am I. It was disturbing to notice how easily other crayons broke, even if they accidently fell on the floor--not these crayons--they passed the test--they're great."
4,Still unbroken!,"My baby is pretty rough on things. These crayons have stood up to over a month of abuse as well as the odd time in the mouth, on the floor, being stepping on, thrown, you name it! Not a single one is broken which has to be some type of record. Even adults would find it hard to break these suckers! So glad we got these because I was so afraid of my baby eating the other ones and having to clean up messes or try to tape crayons back together so they could still be used. These have solved all those problems!"
4,good for an 18 month old,My 18 month old loves to color and these crayons are perfect for him! We use them almost every day.
4,Easy to hold but not hard to break,"Three of the crayons had their tops broken when they arrived and the rest broke subsequently when my toddler pressed down hard with them. However, he loves coloring with these crayons -- they are a nice thickness -- and since he tends to put them in his mouth now and then, I'm glad they are non-toxic."
5,Crayola 8 pack Crayons Jumbo,I was so happy to find this size crayon for little fingers. The other sets would always break leaving frusteration for our 18 month old. She can really press hard and loves this new set. Trippled her interest in coloring.
5,Easy to hold and hard to break!,"My 15 month old just started scribbling and these are perfect! They are easy to hold and use. I love that they come in basic colors so that he can learn color recognition. He really enjoys them. These crayons have been dropped from a high chair, stepped on and thrown in toy boxes WITHOUT breaking!! Highly recommended for new ""artists""!"
5,perfect for little hands great product,crayons for little hands are a wonderful invention. getting them overseas was a problem til i found them on Amazon. great!!!
3,Eh......,I have a 15 month old and the crayons broke as soon as he threw them on the floor. I think if he were older and understood how to color they would be better. Good product for a child older than 15 months.
1,Outrageous Shipping!,You've got to be kidding me! Eight bucks for shipping. No way I'm spending that much!
4,not what i ordered,"I had this Jumbo crayons on my sons wish list and his grandparents ordered for him along with some other stuff. When i received the package the crayons were not the ones on the wish list, it was Crayola brand but they were the LARGE and not the Jumbo.on the other hand, this crayola looks sturdy and thick enough for a 2 year old to paint with."
5,Crayola Jumbo Cryans,These are my favorite crayons for my 2 yr old. They are the perfect size as they are learning to color.
3,"Earshot Jazz, May 2000","Among other out-cat releases, HipSync Records has just issued guitarist Rik Wright's compilation of the best moments of his improvisational performances, including collaborations with altoist Wally Shoup, percussionists Jeph Jerman and Toshi Makihara, and two equally out and idiosyncratic guitarists, Dennis Rea and Ed Petry."
4,Needs a little....,"As with many sugar free items, it might need a little doctoring. I am diabetic so I have to be careful but the way I used it was in a slushie. Once I served my slushie in a cup, I added a capful of sweet and sour drink mix (like you use with a margarita). Of course all those drink mixes are mostly made with sugar, which is a no no for me, but I found that just a capful will ease that diety aftertaste. I liked it and so did my boyfriend.Take care all."
2,a colorful map - little detail,"The free Maps you get from AAA will be of more use to you. There are short paragraphs of each region, but no specific information. The book is a leaflet and not very detailed at all."
1,NOT Made in USA!,"These are NOT made in USA any longer. Irwin was purchased by Newell Rubbermaid and the Nebraska Visa-Grip plant was closed, its employees laid off. All Irwin products are now made in China. Read many reviews before buying--the quality is very bad. Buyer beware!"
3,Aaron's Review,I liked this book because it happens on a farm and I live on a farm and help my dad. I liked the ending because they became friends.
1,NOT WORTH IT!,I got to page 40 in this book and could not continue... I thought to myself.. i dont even care what happens to this kid. Dont read it.
4,"3rd Grade Reading Group, Newport Oregon Elementary School","A compilation of various students:I really liked the book. It is kind of sad in the beginning. I loved this book...it got sadder and sadder but it had a very good ending. The book is `actiony', funny and it makes you want to read it over and over. Worth is the most dramatic action filled, dark gory story I ever read. It lost my 5th star because it has blood and pain, there is a lot of drama. If you don't like blood don't read this. I like the Greek myth stuff. The only thing I didn't like was it didn't have enough Greek myth stuff. My favorite character was Anemone."
4,A Storm,"The main character of the book Worth is named Nathaniel.First, Nathaniel is a hard working boy especially when he brings the hay in to the barn. Second, he is boy that can take pain. A storm hit their farm and he was on a tractor thing and fell off and hurt his leg. Third, Nathaniel is one of those boys that are nice on the outside but sometimes mean on the inside. He doesn't like people that take away his dad. Fourth, Nathaniel is always helping his mom. He puts things that were broken back together that broke. Does that character relate to you?"
2,Worth,"I would give the book i read, two stars. The book, overall, was pretty decent but confusing. I would not recommend anyone under the age of 12, my age, to read this book. I am a good reader and it was hard for me to understand.The book was about a boy who hurt his leg so his parents had to get a farm boy to help around the farm. There were parts of the book where i just didn't get it, then i would get all off track of the whole story. I guess you will have to read it yourself and see if you agree with my opinion, and my opinion is not a good one."
2,Worth,"This book was well written, but very confusing at points. The book rarely described the characters and when they did it was done poorly. In the end I still didn't get a good picture in my head of what Nate or John looked like. Overall I give this 2 stars, and do not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 12. If I could change/add something I would've been more descriptive about the main characters."
4,Great Book!,I really loved this book...great story on how two boys come together after coming from different places. Great relating to the time period.
3,I'll have to agree with the kids!,"I would have to agree with the kids reviews. The story was hard to understand in some places and I am 51 years old! I had to re-read parts in order to understand. the bok jumps from one thing to another without introduction and that makes it confusing, especially for young ones.It also leaves a lot of loose ends.I also wish that she had been a bit more descriptive as she never really described anyone's lookS!Overall it has a good plot and has a lot of suspense, but I don't think younger children would enjoy it much."
3,Worth,I liked the in one way and disliked it in another. I liked Worth because it had a good plot to the book and I disliked it because sometimes the author would write about one character than go right to introducing another
4,"A Book ""Worth"" Reading","This book is amazing! Everybody should read this book. It was really,well,""Worth""reading. It must have really been hard for Nathaniel back then. This book is about a boy named Nathaniel and his leg gets squished in an accident. Then his dad brings an orphan boy named John Worth to help on the farm. I'm not sure if people liked it but I did. A.LaFaye came to my school and if all of her books are as great as this one, I'll read all of them."
4,Brilliant and versatile.,"On his second solo offering,Matheos prove the full extent of his playing capabilities establishing himself as a new Michael Hedges.Whether one likes Fates Warning or not is totally irrelevant here,since this album covers different musical areas,and it does so with the subtlety and beauty that only a great player can display."
1,Not durable,"Thsi blender worked well, and we were pleased with its relatively quiet performance. That is, we were pleased until, after just over a year of very light useage, it simply stopped working. Dead as a doornail. We had a really cheap blender that didn't work as well and was very noisy, but it at least lasted for several years."
2,Control panel,I have had this blender a year. We don't use it heavily - possibly 10 times since we bought it. The numbers are now rubbing off the control panel as if they were printed with water soluble paint.
1,"KEEP YOUR RECEIPT, YOU'LL NEED IT!",I've been through two of these Krup blenders in six months. The pitcher sits upon a ridged rubber drive. These rubber ridges gradually strip off leaving the blender useless. What idiotic engineer thought this design up?! Once again I'm forced to go dig up my 13 year old... blender from storage until I can get my Krups repaired. Now where did I put that receipt?........Tell
3,"Good blender, not so good food processor","The blender works just fine for smoothies, shakes and sauces. It doesn't crush ice as well as some of the more powerful professional blenders I've come across, but it's adequate. The food processor is a poor replacement for a real food processor, i.e. Kitchenaid or Cuisinart. The capacity is small and it does not chop very evenly--half your food turns to mush while the other half remains in big chunks. It is, however, good for making breadcrumbs. Get the blender, but invest in a separate food processor if you really need one that works."
1,Stopped working in just two months,"It is only two months since i purchased this product. and it just went off while working, it was like as if it was slowing down.this particular product is a waste of money. plus their service is bad. when i called them, they cannot do anything without a sales recipt which they consider a proof of purchase, now i am wondering did this blender dropped from sky in my house?the design is really poor, it happens with food processors and blenders that sometimes you spill out some liquid or it comes out due to loose lid. the flaw in this design is that it goes straight into the motor and that's it. it becomes a showpiece.please go for some other far better models available, otherwise u might also end up writing a review here."
1,stopped working after low usage,"I received this blender as a gift 3 or 4 years ago. I use it once every few months to make fruit smoothies. I always pre-crush the ice before inserting it into the blender just to try to extend the blender's life. Yesterday, when I tried to blend some very ripe papaya in the blender, the blades just wouldn't turn! I made sure that everything was assembled correctly, and made sure that the base was turning when the jar was not in place. I verified that I could manually turn the blades in the jar by twisting the attachment under the jar just as the base motor would have done. The problem, I eventually discovered, was that the base and the jar were not mating properly! The star-shaped rubber thing that turns on the base had shrunken so that it could spin freely without turning the blades in the jar! I checked my warranty only to find that it had expired only one year after purchase! Spend your money on a better brand."
4,Great centennial/bicentennial review of San Leandro,"""A Garden Grows in Eden"" is a fun review of the history of San Leandro written circa 1972. Recognizing founding father surnames that became street names brings appreciation for the spirit of the fledgling community and its outreach to neighboring communities on certain regional projects. A must-read for students of history of our local area."
1,Typical sports pot boiler.,Merril may be a funny man on the field but in the book he is boring. As in many sports stories the subject gives the writer a line and the writer blows it up to a paragraph or a nonsensical chapter.
2,Please someone take the editor out back and....,"Durwood Merrill has had some interesting experiences, and crossed paths with some of the more intriguing people behind the scenes of baseball. For that, it may be worth struggling through this poorly written manuscript.Mr Merrill is not expected to be much of an author, and should rely heavily on his editor to tighten up his anecdotes into a readable, coherent, flowing manuscript. Mr. Dent has failed him miserably here. It's as if the editor read each anecdote separately, and forgot about it once he turned the page. Spelling and typos were ATROCIOUS.In short, this book would have been much better if it were edited down to about 2/3rds its size, and nothing of value would have been lost."
1,Not Worth the Effort,"An insiders view of baseball is something I am interested in and attracted me to purchase the book. However, poor writing makes the book frustrating, and extremely tedious to read. Merrills self infatuation and his overblown efforts at promoting a good ol boy image makes the book unbearable."
1,Dad Gum!!!! That darn book was pretty booring.,"What was billed as a wildly hysterical look at major league baseball through the eyes of an umpire turned out to be a rather booring couple of nights of reading. If you want real humor, check out Ron Luciano's efforts. If you want ""ol' boy, down home country lingo"" this will do. The foreward, written by Ken Griffey, Jr. is banal and self-serving. The book itself does little more than proclaim baseball analyst Tim McCarver as a jerk, superstar Reggie Jackson as the ""second coming"" (presumably because he professed to enjoy the author's fried chicken) and Merrill himself as a blind supporter of his fellow umpires. Funny,,, Merrill referred to former umpire Nestor Chylak as ""Nestor Shylock"".Didn't his editors check this out beforehand? That's reason enough for me to ask for my money back. If your looking for baseball humor, try Luciano - and leave this book on the shelf."
5,James Bond,Excellent topic and book. Covers the material very well. I was very suprised by the depth in the material.
3,Potpourri pot,"When I received my potpourri pot-I was very disappointed because I thought it was going to be bigger,also I was thinking that it had a lid."
4,Stylus,"This product came as described. Brand New. They dont fit quite as nice as the original Stylus and I often find them falling out of my HTC 8125, but they do get the job done."
1,I would give it 0 but that's not an option,"The stylus' felt somewhat rusted because they weren't effortless to extend and they didn't fit into the phone. They weren't large enough and didn't click in place. I've been going without a stylus for months so I took it out with me but the very first day, it fell out of the slot."
3,disappointing madness,"Anything by Queneau attracts attention, but this was dissappointing, and hard work to get to the end. The plot, unusually, meanders or is obscure - a thin technique to print the mad scientists' manuscripts that clog up the text."
3,Freakin' Awesome Cyber Punk Goodness !,"Starring Melantha Blackthorne.WOW,Just try and label this `Punk Noir' piece of SciFi /Horror effort.This is amazing in its nods to Blade Runner,Clive Barker and HR Giger.Melantha is truly One-Of-A-Kind in her portrayal and owns this world of Green Screen,CGI and some effects that are off-the-hook.There are some really thought out characters that help the lead for better or for worse.How did the screenwriter and for that matter director come up with this most unusual and successful film ?"
4,works and is [affordable],"Easy to access temp. control. Burner slightly lifts for cleaning. Isn't as quick to heat as a stove burner, but is good for when you don't have the space or money for a more expensive unit."
4,"Very cool atmosphere, layered songs","If you like Sparklehorse, Joseph Arthur, The Twilight Singers, you may find something you like here, in this first, self-recorded release by the Minneapolis band."
4,Good Book For Racing Newbies,"This book goes through the R/C Boat race from Start to finish. It includes everything from driving tips to neccessary equipment and even quick repairs, to keep you on the water. It even shows how to properly set up a race of your own. I've found all of John Finch's books full of information and this is no exception."
3,Taste horrible!,"I got it for the health benefits, which I won't be able to experience because this taste and smells like sweet ass. One of my coworkers enjoyed it so I'll be passing both boxes to him and will just continue to eat more fruits and vegetables. If you don't mind the taste, Bael Fruit has amazing health benefits. Unfortunately, the taste of sweet ass is not to my liking."
5,Best all around Sybase book for the buck.,"Of all the Sybase books that I own (10+) this is the one I look at the most. It is theoretical and practical. Only bad thing I can say about the book is the printing and binding. It is almost 4"" thick and wouldn't stay open flat on a bet. The paper is unusually thick and the diagrams look like something from the pre-TeX days that your kid put together with a screen print and Paint. Content is superb. It covers topics in depth that are not covered at all in equally priced books. Only two others come close: the Unleashed book (day to day how to) and the Sugiyama & Roy book (heavy on the theory, light on the real world)"
2,Smells bad,"I used it for the first time yesterday. It smelled like something plastic or rubber inside the cooker was burning. I was really afraid it's going to burn and kept an eye on it for about 5 hours. The stew was well done but it did scare me. I have no experience with slow cooker, is this smell normal for first-time use, or the one I received has some problem?"
2,Rival 2 1/2 quart crock pot,"this green Rival 2 1/2 quart crock pot cooks nicely. It is a little smaller than my previous 5 quart one, easier to use as my family has gotten smaller. It arrived promptly with a defective crock. I called the company and they checked the paperword then said not to return it, but they would send a new one. I like it."
5,Crockpots are great for college students!,"I purchased this for my granddaughter who is a sophomore at college. She is enjoying it immensely, experimenting with recipes and is the envy of her dormitory. She has ""dinner parties"" for her friends. The pot works well, cooks away while she sleeps or is in class. It is the Rival Crockpot."
5,2 1/2 crock pot,"This 2 1/2 qt crock is a great size for smaller quantities. I have a 5qt that I use frequently but wanted something smaller. It was difficult to decide between the 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 but I am pleased with the 2 1/2. It will certainly cook sauces and fondue but it will cook four large boned chicken breasts or soup for four. I cooked a small beef roast with onions and carrots and it was great. My other crockpot is ""auto"". This Crock is off-low-high. It has not been a problem. The high will have spagetti sauce bubbling in about 1 1/2 hrs. Clean up is easy and the unit feels solid including the switch. The lid fits good with a stainless rim edge. I have had the unit about three weeks and I am going to buy one for my 92 yr old live-alone father-in-law!B F"
2,"Great size, but. . .","I got this crock pot as an alternative to my larger crock pots, which often result in too many leftovers. The 2.5qt size is perfect for 2 people, and for smaller recipes like Mac N Cheese.Unfortunately, this crock pot is just too unreliable to use regularly. Even on Low, it cooks much too hot. This can result in burned or overcooked meals. Even worse, it has a hot spot. This means that if it's not stirred frequently during cooking - and thereby defeating most of the purpose of the crock pot - the food will burn and stick to the crock in that particular spot, even those times that the Low setting isn't too hot.In addition to the cooking problems, there is no ""Warm"" setting on this crock pot. Both of my larger crock pots have this feature, and while it is uncommon in smaller pots, I really miss it.I'll be putting this crock pot in the next yard sale and replacing it with theProctor Silex 3-qt. Slow Cooker."
2,Cooks too quickly,I bought this to replace one that I had had for 25 plus years. Loved my old one. This one cooks way too quickly. There is no way I can cook something for 8 hours on low. Certainly not a slow cooker. Going to look for a replacement
2,"Way, way too hot","Major disappointment. I put a bean soup on low, and five hours later it was all burned [there was plenty of liquid, but it was boiling like there was no tomorrow). I shudder to think what ""hot"" would have done. I definitely should have gotten one with a ""warm"" setting. It was my first experience with a crop pot."
4,Slow cooking for two,"This was my first slow cooker, and I'm now using it a lot even though I don't consider myself a person who regularly enjoys cooking. Two main disadvantages: There's no ""warm"" button for when you're done cooking, just ""low"" and ""high"" cook settings, so its either on or off although the ceramic pot keeps heat pretty well. The size is also a little small- you can cook about four servings of whatever you are making and that's about it. However for about $20, this is a great way to get some great tasting meals pretty cheaply. The overall size and weight is unobtrusive, even for a small kitchen, and the ceramic pot and glass cover feel substantial. On the whole, it feels like a well-made unit."
4,Great for warm dips at parties!,"Bought this for using at parties to keep dips warm, instead of using large crock pot or having to heat things up all the time. Is great for this. Bought 2 more for gifts! The only thing that would make this item better is if it had a warm setting. Hot/high is very hot very fast."
5,Just the right size for a family of three!!,This crock pot is a perfect size for a smaller family. I also got the Fix it and Forget it five ingredient crock pot recipe cookbook. It is so nice to come home from work and have dinner ready!!!
1,Boils on low setting,"As others have noted, Low setting isn't low. The liquid was boiling, verified by thermometer. Cust Service was very good, promising to send a new unit. But I have very little expectation it will be any better. I suggest finding another slow cooker."
4,Handy little cooker,"Nice cooker for a stew for two.The crock is removable for easy clean up.The only slight problem is that the ""Low"" setting is a little too hot. Just stir once in a while and it's fine."
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this pot because I wanted a small slow cooker that I could use to cook oatmeal in overnight. I used this pot a couple times, and it just ended up burning my oatmeal and making a mess. When I read up on slow cookers, I saw that this was a common problem people had when cooking oatmeal in slow cookers, I guess the newer models tend to cook on the hot side. I returned this pot anyways and tried the 1.5 quart proctor silex model, and I am so glad I did. My oatmeal doesn't burn anymore, and it has a keep warm setting, something this Rival pot doesn't have. If you want a small slow-cooker that will cook at the right temperature (low/slow), this pot isn't worth the money."
2,Burn Hazard on High and No Keep-Warm Setting-,"Within twenty minutes the exterior was far too hot to touch when using the appliance on high setting for a full pot of chili. I would consider it unsafe where childern are about because of the high surface temperature.There is no ""keep warm"" setting - just off, low and high."
5,my son loved this movie,my son loves this movie but for a mother only having one tv it was forever long now we have three tvs and that movie is in my sons room next to his tv if you get the picture it is not to be in my dvd player lol it is great for the kids though i would buy others like this again
3,A Review of The Many and the One,"The Many and the One is a useful contribution to the debate overvalue pluralism versus value monism. It is a disappointment, however,in that it neglects the two most important examples. Capitalism, withits scalar utility (~money), REQUIRES value monism. If value monismis wrong then capitalism is wrong and must be discontinued (or atleast substantially altered). The legal systems in all nations, onthe other hand, exhibit value pluralism; you can atone for some crimesby paying a monetary fine whereas when you are found guilty of othercrimes you must pay with your life, or some fraction of it. Clearly,in the legal systems no single common currency exists, utility is avector there.The clear contradiction within the capitalist world (between itseconomic machinery and its legal system) is the sort of thing thatsocialist thinkers have concerned themselves with for some time now.It's too bad The Many and the One ignored this issue."
5,"What Fiduciaries, Trustees, and Professionals need to know","This book is excellent. If you are responsible for investing other people's money as a professional, on the board of a foundation or endowment or are someone who is a trustee on an account, this book is for you. This book goes over important guidelines that should be followed to protect the funds and yourself."
2,Toy Doesn't Work!,"We couldn't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker. Unfortunately, after countless times of putting in new batteries, we realized that the toy didn't work. I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy. I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror, instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it. And to add to that, she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes. Other than that, I really like the walker! lol :} I think it will be better once we get a new toy."
2,it only goes forward,"This is a nicely designed walker and my baby likes it for the most part but we are not exactly satisfied by it for one reason. The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don't. Just like a car, it can only go forward and backward, but not sideways. Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility."
2,Spinning Disaster!,"I bought this product for my son because he is in love with the sesame beginnings videos. He loves the soft toys on the side and the buttons along the toy bar. However, the spinning toy with mirror on the middle of the toy bar is very unsafe. More than once he has bumped his forhead or mouth on it. Once so badly that his lip was bleeding and he was screeming in tears! There has to be a better walker out there than this one. Don't buy it just because it is sesame street like I did. It is a waist of money."
5,GREAT WALKER !!!,"We purchased this walker for our son because he loves Elmo and Sesame Street. We love it! Our son loves pushing the ""musical buttons"" and spinning the red circle in the middle. It glides easily and is a breeze to get our son in and out of. The cover also comes off easily for washing, if necessary.I'm not sure what ""Papa Bear Paul"" was talking about, because there is no paint on our walker and there is no way our son's hand can get caught...Even if your little one doesn't enjoy Sesame Street as much as ours, you will love this walker!!"
4,Great Walker!,I purchased the Sesame Beginnings Walker and my daughter loves it. There is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself. It also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them. This walker makes noise and lights up.There isn't any paint on her walker and I don't know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter.
1,Just use the softeware which comes with the PLC,"I was very excited when I found this book and read the reviews. Chapter one was a small intro to visual basic. The first half of chapter two explained how to input and output with the serial port, great. Then I get to the second half of chapter two and I read that all I need to do is go and get a PLC interface. Why bother with the book then. If I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars on a PLC interface, just buy one which has software, and use the software which comes with it. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure for someone who already has a PLC and needs to revise their programs, this book would be valuable, however for the person who is interested in using the serial port to acquire ideas and tips for simple input/output application around the home, it is frustrating. Maybe the title should be Programming for the PLC in Visual Basic 6. That would be much more appropriate."
4,Nice Reference for my Visual Basic Manufacturing Apps.,Credit is do to Mr. Leonik for producing this book. I'll use it as a nice reference for some of my manufacturing applications written in Visual Basic. The methods covered in this book can be applied to many real world events. Thanks for taking the time to share your knowledge.Visual Basic Applications Programmer {Specializing in Data Acquisition & Process Control for QA and Industrial Environments.}
2,Just a copy of AB manual,After reading the authors review I bought this book. It has nothing just a copy of DF1 protocol for Allen Bradley PLC (Unprotected Reads and Write). This book is a basic book not for advanced users.
5,Buy two... holy cow!,"I have purchased a dozen paring knives over twenty years and these do not compare to permanently SHARP, (just bought one $140 Shun, little different) ... I lost my last ceramic and boy, boy did I miss it, now I love to cut everything in sight again... cannot go wrong (do not buy with little kids, too sharp and might break) GREAT PRODUCT A+ buy three and leave them around for all tasks... lasts forever!"
1,"Blunt tip, bad photo",The knife pictured here is the fine point which is prefered for fine decorating work and most plunging cuts. The knife shipped was the blunt or round tip verion which while more durable is nearly useless for fine work with the tip of the blade.
3,Good Writer!,"This guy just flat out writes well. This is the third book of his that I've read, and although it's not his absolute best, it's still a very good read. The book is actually deserving of 3 1/2 stars."
3,double barrel vengence,"style is dense, yet compelling. narrator spends half the time on introspection, slowing the pace to explain his thinking. the one-upmanship in legal strategies becomes as tedious as reading commentary on a sports event. the main character's ruminations come off more like polonius than hamlet. still, worthwhile reading."
5,Here's One For Courtroom Lovers,"About 75% of this novel takes place in the courtroom. If you love well done trial scenes this is the book for you. The technical aspects of the trials seemed quite complex at times, but were always interesting. I was amazed that the author, who doesn't seem to have a law degree, was able to write so convincingly about the legal world. The author even varied from the usual protagonist stereotype of ""tall, dark and handsome."" His hero prosecutor, is short, dumpy and not handsome at all. The first thing I did after reading the book is to come to this website and order all the other Gruenfeld novels."
3,Although this is a good book on the need and principals of building fault-tolerant logic - it lacks the how to do it,"I liked this book as a way to understand the need and use of fault-tolerant logic design. What it lacked is how one would do it using an HDL. Knowing 'what' is generally most useful when how is presented as well. I didn't want to design to the gate level to gain the benefit of these principals. So, after I read it I was left hungry for a solution."
1,Self-indulgent,"There is a notion in the Buddhist tradition that there is no such thing as a self. Given that this book is totally self-indulgent, and about Buddhism (I think), then there are some paradoxes here. It is written in that absurd opaque self-referential style characteristic of bad post-modernism, and is basically for the author's own self-delight. The rest of us are doomed to stand outside for a moment, watching the juggler of notions in the dime store window, looking at himself delightfully in a series of distorting mirrors -- then, shrugging our shoulders, we head out into the business of life once more, carrying our much worn copies of ""Being and Nothingness"" in our knapsacks as we trudge along."
3,Little if Anything,"First I feel obliged to say something nice about this work and have to say that any work that looks at one complex writer's ontology through the challenging frame of a concept like emptiness in Buddhist philosophy deserves some commendation. Laycock's work is, however, too dry, scholastic and obscurantist. Whatever his subjective experience, if he writes for the general public then he should try to imagine the needs of his reader. He should do a basic writing course as well. I also found more accessible accounts of Sartre's work and its similarity to early Buddhist epistomology and ontology by Asisan authors. I also found Sartre's ""Being and Nothingness"" much easier to read than Laycock's flight of associations."
1,I want my money back.,The book reads like an academic journal whose audience enjoys reading in the jargon of its highly specialized field. I don't recommend this book at all. Boring...I want my money back.
2,Krups Lasted Less Than 2 Years,"We wanted a toaster that would last. We paid extra for the Krups Sensotoast Compact (two slice) but, it didn't last any longer than cheap ones.We were not happy with performance either - I don't know that it ever toasted evenly (hmmm, ... maybe when it was brand new it did)"
2,krups toaster is krap,I think Krups should stick to coffee makers. After reading reviews I bought the toaster. For the price I could have gotten two cheaper toasters that would do a comparable job. It does not do a good job of toasting evenly and you burn your fingers getting the toast out because the finished product sits so low in the slots. Save your money.
2,Doesn't last,"When the toaster was new, I'd give it 4 stars. Unlike some of the other reviewers, we found it toasted fairly evenly. However, if I'm spending $80 on a toaster, I'd expect it to last. Since it's been two years since we got the toaster and now it only lightly browns toast on its highest & longest setting, it's time to shop for a new toaster. We WON'T be buying Krups again."
4,Fine for only two pieces of taost at a time.,"This toaster is fine for me as long as I don't need to toast more than two pieces of toast or one English muffin at time (and I need to limit my consumption of bread to a reasonable extent), which I don't now, generally, and which doesn't matter that much in any case because it doesn't take much longer to toast more than that, when I need to do so. I have a limited amount of space on which to put things in the kitchen, and this toaster does not take up an inordinate amount of space."
5,escaping categories in BPrince's ardhitecture,"Since I personlly know both author/wife and architect I can look back over 12 or 13 years and say, uniquivocally, that Dr Mead and his wife/photographer have not only escaped the dreaded, and all too common categorization and sycophantic drooling that characterises most architectural books, articals, essays, reviews ... just pick a category and some adjectives for yourself. THIS IS GOOD, SOUND WORK -- as an architect who benefited from both their perspectives, and as a frequent editor -- THIS IS GOOD, SOUND WORK. Top drawer."
4,great for photos...not so great for design info,"Because of the small amount of work that Bart Prince has produced over the years has resulted on very little articles of his work. This book is packed with great photos of his most prominent work. There are even a few sections and details of some. The only quarrel I have is that the first 3/4 of the book is just pictures and the last actual text. What little text there is talkes little about him, his family, and the history of the area the majority of his buildings are located. The book doesn't actually mention much if any on the design, process, or construction of his art. I still rated the book a 4 because you can still learn alot simply through the great photography."
1,8mm Head cleaner doesn't work,"Each time I inserted the tape into the recorder it was immediately ejected. It worked once for a second, long enough to partially clean the heads. Have been unable to get it to work again. Very disappointing."
1,Eject! Eject!,"So my 8mm Sharp Viewcam needs a cleaning and I go to Walmart and several other stores and I can find no store that has 8mm cleaner. I go to Amazon and I'm amazed at the price Sony wants. Something like 39 bucks plus shipping and I'm thinking,""Jeez,we're talking a sizable investment for a dumb cleaner."" Outrageous. But then my eyes see this Dynex cleaner at what is closer to non-gouging price. So I buy it and with shipping I'm getting under 10 bucks.Arrives okay but I put it in and the dreaded Eject message flashes and it won't accept it. So I'm out 10 bucks. The cleaner may work on some 10 mm camcorders, but not Sharp. So I get a Q tip and I dip it in some alcohol and dab here and there following the path of a tape, not sure where I'm suppose to clean. And then I wait 5 minutes for it to dry and pop a tape in. Voila! It worked. Total cost...about 13 cents."
3,Long live Olds Toronado,I have seversl Yat Ming models and they are well built but not as toys for young kids. Small parts may come off if played with. They are great as collector items though. I have this one and it looks great. The headlights open and shut along with the hood and doors. Steering works too. Good for the youngsters to see how REAL cars were made back in the 1960's.
3,"engaging read, small town setting, crowd of characters","An over elaborate plot of skulldugery in a small town in Vermont is more than made up for by the regard the reader begins to feel for the characters. Police hero is more than real, and his associates engage your interest. The value of the book is in the characterizations, the plot is over spun and farfetched. Still the book makes a good read and serves as an introduction to what is an ongoing series"
5,Love love love!,"What a great writer, I love Archer Mayor's style and in particular the Joe Gunther series. So glad that when I found this author and series I was able to start at the beginning of the series."
1,LEAKY.,"I was unfortunate enough to brew tea in this kettle while in my TA office. It leaked boiling tea all over my desk, the papers I was grading, and the books that I had borrowed from the library. I like for my tea to stay IN my kettles until invited into a mug."
4,I had one of these,"I must say that for the price, this is a very versatile item. I actually figured out how to cook spagetti in it. First you boil the water, then put in the pasta. Set it to the warm knob until tender. And you can also heat up your sauce. A real lifesaver on weekends when the university cafeteria was closed =-). I was really sad when it stopped working, but it lasted me through my first year, until I moved out of the dorms."
1,Dangerous!,"My 90-year-old dad has this pot, and I'm getting him a different one, ASAP! The lid falls off when the pot is tipped up to pour out the last of the water, which is certainly a hazard. Holding the lid on isn't advisable, either, because it heats up along with the water, and becomes too hot to touch. Worse, even with the lid on ""securely"", steam excapes and burns your hand as you pour. Add to that the health concerns about ingesting anything cooked or heated in plastic. My recommendation: Stay away from this one!"
5,My new favorite album!!!!,"I have always loved Monte Warden's simple love songs but have never been able to totally embrace an album of his...UNTIL NOW!!! This is a beautiful piece of art. The songs THE LOVE YOU PROMISED ME and A STRANGER TO ME NOW"" spoke directly to my heart. I am sure this is the album that brings Monte Warden the success he so richly deserves."
5,It's about time!,"I have to admit, this disc took a few spins to grow on me, and boy did it grow. I'm a total music snob, and admittedly have to skip forward on only one tune here. That's a record for me. ""THE LOVE YOU PROMISED ME"" is a beauty. I'd like to hear his vocals more - producers listen up. ""MADELINE"" has been played back to back a zillion times over in my car - it's a good mood song for sure! Keep spinning this disc - it get's in your blood and you'll wonder where he's been so long. This one made me drag out my old Wagoneers tapes. We've missed you Monte!"
5,"A Great ""New Artist""","I first heard one cut on this CD ""I call you on the Phone"" and it knocked my socks off. I must have played it thousands of times since and I also have passed information about around the world. It is truly a great song and sound in the Hoagy Carmichael style of Lyric. This album has many gems on it and should put Monte Warden over the top."
3,"Heroic, Russian propaganda piece pre-World War II .","Alexander Nevsky takes place in the 13th century but it is overtly anti-German. There seems to be fear & hatred of the Germans then & also 1938. The same nation that Russia signed a treaty with In 1939 & was treacherously attacked by in 1941. Brillant black & white photography by Sergei Eisenstein. It takes little time to realize that Kurosawa's Seventh Samurai & more importantly Luca's Star Wars were influenced by this movie. The music by Prokofiev stands alone, but the marriage of the music & the battle scenes is compelling. Many reviewers complain of bad transfer of the music to their dvd copies. The vhs I had, while not great, was pretty good. So the Rus defeats the Germans on the ice in an epic battle. The German knights are ultimately defeated by the melting ice. Their heavyy armour being their undoing. The acting is wooden & demensional, but the photography was revolutionary."
4,TIME FOR HEROES,"Alexander Nevsky.This is a story of war, pain and glory,Tragedy, slavery, death and the sorrow,Heroes and honesty, strength of denial,Life on your knees - rather die in a fire,Even when all seams so lost, non-existent,Heroes step forward to lead the resistance,This movie was made in the middle of war,The country seamed lost and the millions died,But spirits of heroes from the ancient worldCalled people to rise in the righteous fight."
2,Get the BMG version on VHS or LaserDisc,"I'm afraid I've got to agree with the earlier one-star reviews -- although, since the beauty of the work shines through the terrible transfer, I felt it deserved a better rating. I was lucky enough to find a copy of the BMG release on LaserDisc. The sound track, rescored for full symphony and recorded with state of the art digital technology, is awesome in sound and performance. The restored print is excellent on that version as well.Soundwise, the VHS version ought to be up to par with the laserdisc version."
4,An impressive debut for a 34-year old actor,"Cherkasov was in his mid-thirties when he started acting. I believe, this was one of his early roles. I think he was casted not as much for his talent as for his looks. He does have the screen presence. You can tell that he had a crash course in dramatic acting, because his gestures are so stylicized. Subtlety may not be his strongest quality, but the movie does not call call for subtlety. The movie calls for a larger-than-life hero, and a larger-than-life actor. This was Cherkasov's golden voyage, because - let's face it - he doesn't have much of a range. This is a perfect role for him - simple and direct."
4,Russia on the brink of the Second World War,"It helps us understand what the movie is about when we realize it was made on the eve of the outbreak of the Second World War, only two or three years before the Germans invaded Russia. The real Second World War was fought between Russia and Germany, not between Germany and the allies. Tens of millions of people died in eastern europe between 1941 and 1945. At times, more Russians lost their lives in a few days than the British and Americans lost in the entire war. I imagine that many of those Russians had seen this movie; their loyalty to their country, to the land, to its people was in part formed by this movie. So, if you want to begin to understand what carried the Russians through from Stalingrad to Berlin, see Alexander Nevsky."
1,"Great movie, bad DVD","I have watched Alexander Nevsky more times than I've watched any other movie. It is a great movie, deserving 5 stars. This particular DVD, however, is the worst transfer to DVD that I have seen. At first I intended to watch it on my computer. The image was so jumpy I could not watch it more than a few minutes.There are at least two versions of this movie with English subtitles on VHS. Both are worth watching. Some are older and have the ""mistaken"" music track. A new version was released in 1995 with new subtitles and a newly recorded score. There are editing changes in the 1995 version as well.I see that there is a version of Alexander Nevsky that is part of a 3-dvd set.But at this date (May, 2002) there doesn't seem to be a single dvd of Alexander Nevsky that is worth watching.There are Russian versions without subtitles and a few versions with English subtitles. I hope someone does a good tranfer of at least ONE of the versions to a single DVD soon."
1,WRETCHED sound makes DVD worth one star,"Although I truly love the film (and the video tranfer is great), this DVD has the horrible 1930's recording of the soundtrack. Prokofiev's great score sounds like it is playing from an AM radio placed undera mattress. Unless you are truly wedded to DVD format, get the BMG video which includes an excellent re-recording of the score in modern stereo (along with a great video). We can only hope that the BMG version gets to DVD soon."
1,DVD Quality Is An Insult To This Eisenstein Masterpiece,"I agree completely with Dan Sherman from Washington, D.C., the Image DVD is horrible compared to the BMG VHS version of Sergei Eisenstein's ""Alexander Nevsky"". This true masterpiece of cinema is presented in a poor print with a muddled Prokofiev score on the DVD. Image should be praised for releasing such classics as F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" and several of Eisenstein's classics on DVD, but it is truly disappointing that this DVD version of ""Alexander Nevsky"" is not preferable to a VHS version already available. I was very excited when the DVD was released, but when I put it in my player and played the Battle on the Ice to see how good it would be on DVD, I was absolutely depressed after having seen the beautiful print and new recording of Prokofiev's score that BMG had used for their VHS version. Hopefully, BMG releases their version on DVD someday."
1,Defective DVD,"Well, the movie's terrific, from what I remember of having seen it on TV, but you wouldn't be able to tell it from this DVD. The manufacture is of such poor quality that my player kept skipping over damaged sections. I couldn't watch five minutes of it. I don't have this problem with other DVDs. When I went to Amazon's website for help, all it recommended that I do about a defective product was ""Consult owner's manual"". Seriously??? For a DVD??? I have bought DVD's from Amazon in the past, without any trouble, but hereafter this will cause me to hesitate to buy DVDs here; if at all possible I will go to a brick-and-mortar store where I can take it back if necessary, as Amazon's motto seems to be ""Caveat emptor""."
2,Not ...,"This press worked perfectly for about six months. At that point it broke into two pieces. I'll replace it someday, but with a tool that's feels more like steel than plastic."
2,Could be better,Yet another garlic press that doesn't push all the garlic through. Leaves a good amount of perfectly good garlic in the chamber that you then have to remove and chop up. The search for a decent garlic press resumes!
2,Breaks Easily,"I have broken three of these. I am not particularly large, but if you want to press ginger, they will break. They seem capable of crushing garlic, but the hinge mechanism is surprisingly weak. I'm not very big or excessively strong, but putting a piece of ginger in the press and squeezing with one hand will consistently break the hinge. Not recommended.After breaking 3, I've switched to theZyliss, 12080, Susi 2 Garlic Press. It's not as good looking, but I've had it for a few months, and it hasn't broken yet."
2,Nothing new here,"I bought this book recently while in Thailand, hoping that Thurow would offer-up something interesting - more or less along the lines of the early 90s work, such as ""Head to Head."" Not here. I checked the date and the book was initially published in 2003, which means he probably wrote the mainstay in 2002. To me, if you have never thought about globalization and its implications, then buy it. If you have already, then this is nothing more than a collections of truisms that anybody with any interest in the subject would know already."
3,A somewhat timid picture (part 2),"...This is an entertaining book on international economics, though perhaps for the wrong reasons."
3,Sense & nonsense,"When Thurow questions the wisdom of the Chinese buying hundreds of millions of dollars of US Treasuries (""poor Chinese are making loans to rich Americans"" - ""it doesn't make any sense""), perhaps he should ask a better question: Does it make more sense then that rich Americans are racking up out-of-control budget deficits whose interest payments we will not be able to meet in the future; or that American consumers save less than the average Chinese farmers and spend most of their income away instead? We are a rich country living beyond our means, while the Chinese are poor folks saving as hard as they work. Tell me which makes sense and which makes nonsense."
1,Exports,"Mr. Thurow and Mr. Pawley have completely forgotten that the United States did not depend on exporting to develop its economy after the colonial period because its industrial growth was based on domestic consumption. At some point in the future, the same will happen to China when American consumers can no longer absorb cheap Chinese exports, yet China will continue to grow. This is a basic lesson from economic history which neither the author of this book nor Mr. Pawley seems to know."
1,Per capita GDP,"At no point did the Soviet Union achieve a per capita GDP anywhere near that of the United States. Even today Russia's per capita income in PPP is less than 30% America's per capita income - much less in nominal GDP. Yet the USSR was a great power. When China becomes the world's largest economy, its per capita income doesn't matter simply because no international institution can change its rules without Chinese consent. Nor can Washington ignore China simply because of China's low per capita income. No military domination is required. As for Pawley's ethnic slur, what else can I espect from someone from South Africa?"
4,Gaither Vocal Band Better Day,I didn't like this one as much as I like the other Gaither Vocal Band DVD's.
4,Nice Duvet,I got this duvet at a good price and was pleased with it's quality and feel. It is so soft it reminds me of egyptian cotton.And it is so roomy that my husband and I put our king goose down comforter in this queen size duvet. Good buy$.
4,Good product,"After reading other reviews, I was concerned that this cover would be an odd color. It's more of a ""peach"" color. It was difficult to find an oversize cover to fit my oversized queen comforter, and this fit the bill perfectly. (My comforter is 90 X 98 inches) It has quality stitching and convenient button-shut end design."
4,Growing in intimacy with God,I wasn't able to spend the time on this study that I would have liked to. I intend to return to it in a few months. I think it has wonderful potential for deepening a relationship with God.
3,"Works, but noisy & built cheap","This pump fit my BMW E38 perfectly (main windshield jets only, you'll need a second, larger pump for the headlights). However, it is noticeably noisier, very much so. Despite being buried under many things, and far away from the driver's seat, the sound it makes is something even a Kia owner would be embarrassed about - about the equivalent of having one of those Water Pik things a few feet away.Not only does it make a lot of noise when operating, it also looks and feels rather cheap. Not sure how to describe that in words, but it just ""feels"" like it'll die in a few months.I'd recommend spending the extra $15 and going OEM, especially since the washer fluid pump isn't easily accessible."
3,"OK, not great","The music is OK, not great. Production is sub-par. This CD is mentioned in many other discussions of artists, so it must be important to the genre, but it did not induce me to begin exploring any of the individual artists."
5,More! More!,"I came across this, like so many others have, by accident. Late one night, I heard ""Shades of Gray"" and then I had to hear it again and again. Mechanically, the story is one of the best told in modern folk music and stands reminiscent of Bobbi Gentry's ""Ode to Billie Joe"". The rest of the CD is of similar caliber and shows that yes Virginia, there is intelligent music out there. The great irony is, the same depth that makes this CD so sweet is precisely what will keep it off pop radio, but I am thrilled by this trio and their voyage on the musical road less travelled. It is uniquely their own."
3,Two Thirds of a Great Collaboration,"I've never liked Lucy Kaplansky, and in my estimation she is not just the weak link, but the dead link between two towering artists in this collection. Kaplansky's nasal, cloying delivery never fails to irritate, and it takes two stars away from what could have been a masterpiece of modern folk. Too bad Williams and Shindell couldn't have recruited Patty Larkin or Susan Werner. . ."
2,Something Lacking,"I was amazed at how little I enjoyed this cd. I love listening to Dar Williams, and I have heard some Lucy Kaplansky songs that I truly enjoyed. In addition, all of the songs on here are great songs. Unfortunately, great songs and great artists do not always make a great record. I actually went and found the original versions of the few songs on this album I had not heard before, and enjoyed them more than the album. The harmonies are lovely, but I think the passion is lacking. These songs deserve more than nice arrangements; they need to be sung from the heart. The overwhelming production glosses over the beautiful edges of these songs."
5,"A taste of Visual Basic. ""You can't eat just one""","I would recommend this ""kit"" to anyone. I had absolutely no experience in Visual Basic Programming and completed the ""Step by Step"" book in about a week. I feel fairly competent in the basic language now and am wanting more. This book is absolutely wonderful for beginners (like me). It gives you a taste of the language and the design phase of programming with Visual Basic. My only problem now is that I want more!! I want the professional edition of VB5 so I can learn more and do more with what I've taught myself. The programmers guide is the ""Programming Bible"" I will refer to forever."
2,Didn't work long.,"I bought this coffee maker in November of 2002. I enjoyed the coffee maker while it lasted. It looked good. It made good coffee. I was happy. I thought we had a good relationship. Then one morning I woke up and our relationship was over. There was no longer any fire in my coffee maker's heating element. I guess I was too demanding and the coffee maker just couldn't keep up. Poor guy. Now he just sits pathetically on my countertop with his broken heating element, dreaming of the good old days."
2,Worst Coffee maker...,"Of all the coffee makers I've owned in the past, this one was probably the worst...The biggest problem I had with it was the place for pouring the water! It's a very small fill area, and water always ended up all over the counter!Of course there were other problems... I ended up giving it away...and went back to my BRAUN, which, I still love after 10 years of usage... Just need a new pot..."
3,Beware of filter availability!,"I rec'd. this as a gift, and have been fairly content with it. The only negative points sofar have been: A)the difficulty in finding replacement filters (Stores that sold the machine could not even order the filters). I finally found them at an appliance repair store, at around [$$$] each. The machine itself performs well. The timer system is easy to program.B) don't accidentally pour more than 10 cups of water in it - the water leaks everywhere."
2,Form over function,"This is a novel looking coffeemaker but it's usability is hampered by several design flaws. The water resevoir opening is small, and if care isn't taken when filling, it dribbles down the back and onto the counter. The spherical carafe is difficult to pour without dripping and costs over $20 to replace, holding only 10 cups. The brew basket is not a standard shape, so no permanent filter can be used and the brewling process is uneven. The carafe must be ""locked"" into place on the warming plate. Yes, it looks good, but I expect good usability from a German design; this made in Mexico model disappoints."
1,Looks great but... coffee was not so great,I am a coffee snob -- I admit it. I loved the look of this coffeemaker and really wanted a maker with a timer and not too many other bells and whistles. This looked great but the coffee it made was nowhere near as good as what I already had. <sigh> I returned it.
2,Two problems,"The absence of an auto shut-off can be a problem. Especially if you are used to a coffee maker with more features.The unit does tend to spill easily when filling with water and pouring. You have to be sure of a lot of room and to pour very slowly when filling. I agree with earlier raters who mentioned this.The design is very nice, but some work needs to be done on the spout/pouring problem. It does make excellent coffee."
2,Better Have a Rag and Some Liquid Cleaner,"Makes Great coffee...... BUT................... You better have a rag and a Jug of Fantastic because every time you fill it up or pour coffee it slips out the side of the Carafe. Although the Unit looks Great, Every time you Por it gets all over. E mailed Krups with No response. Please see other Reviews in this section. I originally Ignored someone else with similar sentiments. Dont buy it and if you do save your receipt and all packaging materials...."
2,one bad coffee maker,"Folks, this coffee maker had to be the worst one ever one. A few reasons why:1. Coffee is never hot enough 2. I constantly spill water while trying to fill it up because of the small opening. 3. The lid to the carafe was terrible. I would constantly spill the coffee when trying to pour. Come to find out that the lid was recalled and they sent me different one. Regardless, not this coffemaker is not worth the money!"
1,Fatal Design Flaw,"I love the water filter and the sleek style of this coffemaker, but the carafe has a fatal design flaw. When the lid is on the carafe, coffee will spill out around the edges of the pour spout and trickle down the side of the carafe and miss the mug. I now just remove the lid from the carafe entirely to avoid a mess, but the coffee doesn't retain as much warmth as a result. I've talked to other folks who have had the exact same problem with this coffee maker. Its a pretty machine, but it isn't as functional as it should be for the money."
2,Coffee Never Hot Enough,"I purchased the Krups because I hoped it would be a quality coffeemaker and I would have been completely happy with it had the coffee been hot enough. I set my machine to stay on for 5 hours but after I add some cream (just a little) to my cup of coffee, the coffee is not hot enough and I had to nuke it each time to be able to drink it. The carafe never leaked or dripped and I truly loved the look of this machine and how it worked but the heating element is just simply not hot enough. I wrote to Krups customer care and they had the audacity to tell me to take it to my nearest repair center and PAY THEM to repair the element! I took my Krups back to the store where I purchased it and got a refund. I am now shopping for a completely different coffee maker."
3,Coffee o'spillo,"I received this coffee maker as a Christmas gift. From day one, everytime I pour a cup of coffee, the coffee ends up dripping down the coffee pot. I have gotten use to the spillage and have the habit of using a towel around the pot when I pour.My son pulled the machine off of the counter and has broken the lid. Now I am in the market of searching for the perfect coffee maker. This one has been rather cool with its sleek design, however, does not make the cup in ""flavor brewing."""
1,THE GLASS WILL BREAK,"I paid 50 bucks for the Krups coffer maker, which you can now get for 30 bucks. However the Carafe still cost 25 bucks to replace - when it breaks. And yes, your cute little round pot will break with the slightest pressure. Speaking of, I'm under pressure to replace the Carafe since the pot (aka: Brittle Carafe) looks so darn cool. Hum. Looks or quality? I'm going back to quality. I learned my lesson. Hope you know better"
1,Un disco aburrido de Elvis Crespo,"Creo que este album no tiene el merengue al que me tiene acostumbrado Elvis, suena como un un disco mas bien POP que Merengue, creo que este disco puede sonar bien en otros paises Suramericanos pero en New York, Puerto Rico, Republica Dominicana y USA completo, no creo por que nos gusta el buen merengue. Elvis, no good's very bad."
5,A Classic Instructional title now on DVD,"The mediocre video quality is ported straight from the VHS and you can still hear the 120hz hum on the audio thoughout, but Eric Johnson dazzles as he gives an overview of his style and techniques during the ""Ah Via Musicom"" era. Recommended."
5,Loaded with ideas,"Eric Johnson really seems to have mastered a variety of styles. This video is light on music theory, but heavy on useful tips and tricks. His exploration of Hendrix, Richards, Reed, Atkins, and others makes this video an interesting look into the styles of several guitarists, and complete with examples of how to play in their styles. He also demonstrates many interesting harmonic uses and talks a lot about picking and fingering (which isn't that relevant for the advance player, but there are still things one can pick up and incorporate). This is DVD has little fundamental music education (doesn't dive into scale theory much) but many tips on how to get interesting sounds and melodic lines, as well as some nice tips on chord voicings."
1,Big Flaw,"This kettle does its job really well but it has one big problem with it - there is no way to open the container to clean the bottom of the pan. In about 2 months of use, my kettle got scaly lime deposits and it was disgusting to use the water in the kettle after that. I tried cleaning it with CLR but nothing came out and I had to throw away the kettle. If you are in the mood for a disposable kettle you can go for it but otherwise stay away."
3,An ok read,"This book by Byatt was unfortunately for me, not my cup of tea. Perhaps if I had read the first two I would feel differently but this one did not force me to read it. I had to work to get through the book and that is not the way I enjoy books.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Satisfying reading with rich details yet somewhat elusive,"Byatt does a good job in lifting a mundane, sordid, humiliating and ugly and yet somewhat ordinary divorce story into a page turner by attempting to elevate the episode into an epic proportion by relying on simultanous narrative of Babeltower, an obscenity book case."
1,I thought it would never end!,I am nearing the end of this large 600 page book.Byatt could have had a better book if she had reduced thisbook by about 300 pages.There are a few parts of the book that I found interestingbut it became a chore to read rather than a delight.
2,I thought it would never end -- utterly tedious.,"I'm not sure who Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel. I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point. The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes. But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'. Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations. I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers: this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers. It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then. Yuck."
1,Boring and hard to follow,"I have never read a book by Byatt but I found this book boring. The characters weren't great and I found myself not wanting to follow the story because of the droning paragraphs. I read constantly and hardly ever don't finish a book, but after 5 chapters I just couldn't force myself to read on."
1,Vast - overrated - dull - affected and utterly boring,"This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say."
2,Very slim,"This book shouldn't be overrated. It's nice to see the storyline of the second film presented in it, and it has a couple of nice pics. But that's it. The commentary is absulutely worthless and adds nothing unless you're a complete Tolkien novice. Very much a children's book, I bought it for the film storyline (which once again deviates significantly from the books at certain parts) and some stunning pics, of which there are but a few. And the storyline of the film will be known to all soon anyway so it's only merit post-TTT release will be a few nice pics.Gary Russell's Art of the Fellowship of the Ring would be a much more worthwhile purchase. I wonder if he'll do another one for TTT and RoTK..."
4,"Good for pre-movie viewing, but pretty worthless after","It's a good book, don't get me wrong. There's some magnificent pictures from the second installment in New Line's The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's the whole movie plot simplified.But this book is only worth something before the movie. Afterward, it just loses its luster. Since you've already seen the movie, why look at the pictures again?Nonetheless, there are some interesting items that take place in the book that give some hints as to what some extended material for The Two Towers' extended release will be. (For instance, the plot line about Aragorn releasing Theodred's horse Brego, which rescues him in the movie after the Warg battle. In the movie, the horse just showed up, without prior mention of it)There's also (at least in ours) a page of stickers in the back of the book, but since there's only one to a character, no one wants to remove them from the page."
4,interesting,i like the feel of this.. i didnt relize how skinny it was.. its adorable.. but for what i paid for it.. there should be more to it.. i like how my mouse glides... but it feels weird not having that normal thickness i like in my mouse pads... but its IS beautiful.
1,Ink leaks everywhere,"Price was surely attractive, but upon installation, the cartidge leaks ink all over the printed pages. Completely worthless to me, but can hardly afford $15.00 shipping to try to get a $21 refund."
1,HP Series II toner,"Received toner in great time, but toner leaves ink lines all over the page. I guess I got what I paid for. Now I have to buy another one. I am not a happy camper.Sandra"
1,HP Cartridge defective upon receipt,"I received this HP 92295A cartridge yesterday from JennyV in Potomac, MD.I initially got heavy black lines all across the page and, after printing50 pages, the lines are still there.I have no email address for JennyV -- can anybody help with that?What recourse do I have at this point?Unhappy in NY,Earl"
3,Onion Melba Toast,"Received the melba toast quickly but some of the boxes were a bit stale and some boxes had many broken pieces. Overall most of the boxes were ok. Thanks,"
3,Krups SensoToast Deluxe,"I really liked this toaster, it did a great job on everything from bagels to frozen bread slices. Unfortunately it died after only 18 months of use (no kids, just two adults) - stopped working altogether. Now looking for a more durable model"
1,Not reliable,I purchased this product in May and in September it quit working. I would not recommend this toaster.
1,Short-Lived,"It worked just fine when I had it, but I didn't have it long. I used the toaster just once a week, perhaps even less. In less than a year's time it up and died! It was a little pricey for such a short-lived product!"
2,burned out in about two years,"we bought this about two years ago when our ancient black and decker basic toaster finally gave up the ghost. we never found that it did that great a job toasting things evenly (i.e., on both sides), but it was at least passable. the big slots were certainly a plus. sadly, it died with a pop the other morning, undoubtedly some electronic component (capacitor, perhaps?) having failed catastrophically. for the money, one certainly expects better quality and longevity. we won't be buying another, and i certainly wouldn't recommend this toaster to anybody that asked."
2,"not very reliable, and service very lengthy","Mine failed after a few months. I sent it to the repair center that Krups' referred me to. The service center received it on June 25th. As of Aug 13th, the part it is awaiting has not yet arrived."
1,Save Your Money!!,"After the initial shock of spending $50 on a toaster I though I had made a good purchase. Krups is a good name, I have a coffee machine by them that I love. I figured this toaster would last forever. I was wrong. First I noticed that the heating element is on ONE side of each compartment. If I wanted waffles/toast/patries to be EVENLY browned (and who wouldn't??) I had to pop up the waffles, etc. up halfway through the cooking time and flip them over. NOT fun first thing in the morning with screaming, hungry kids waiting...then today, less that a year after I bought it, it practically exploded when I was making waffles. I have yet to find a good, decent toaster that lasts longer than a year or two that actually DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL. I'm giving up. I guess I should by cheap toasters every 8 months.....save your money. Buy something else."
2,"works well, won't last","This is a great toaster, for four to eight monthes. It is the most even heating and consistant working toaster I have ever used. But in the past 18 monthes I've had 3 units. I have been fortunate in that the Ace hardware store I bought it at has allowed me to return it twice. But now with my receipt over a year old they're saying no way. Too bad, it was nice while it lasted."
2,Mine died too...,"I was searching for a new toaster to replace this model and for kicks decided to see how others have fared with this unit. It was surprising to see that many other reviewer's toasters died in the same short amount of time as mine (less than 2 years). This was not a cheap toaster, and worked pretty well for all of that time, but it should last much longer. I'll spend my money elsewhere this go around."
2,it worked fine until...,Toaster worked OK until dying rather suddenly one year later without much announcement. It was functional until its untimely demise which seems particularly untimely considering the price we paid originally (~70 bucks). (...)
1,1 year old and broke down 3 times,I received this toaster as a shower gift for my wedding. It broke down 3 times in the first year and we had to pay for it because it was not covered under the warrenty. It broke down recently and it is only 2 years old and we gave up. No more fixing and no more spending money on a waste of a product.
2,"big slots, too hot","I got this toaster at the recommendation of Alton Brown's book. I like real bread, not that gummi-america crap, so the long slots were a definite plus, but I have found the toaster to be too hot. several times now i have gone to the toaster after the cycle and found the edges of the toast burnt and smoke in the air. don't think I would buy it again or recommend it."
1,Died after 13 months....,"Took the taoster apart after I witnessed a bright flash....pop. The circuit board inside was burned and the wire connecting this board to the element was burned away. After investigating further, the solder connection at the 4 element joints were severely burnt, meaning to me that the designer responsible didn't use the appropriate gauge and connection surface area. A poor design, and dangerous as well. Couldn't they have placed a...fuse in there somewhere, I would of payed the extra money..."
1,Don't buy this toaster,"This toaster is only 2 years old. It worked great until the other day - nothing! There wasn't any warning signs, it just stopped working. I was very disappointed since the Krups name has been around for a while. I will not buy another."
1,"Shallow, inane","EHC honestly could be one of the most horrible bands in existance. The lyrics could not be cheezier or more horrible. If I were any kind of Satanist, or member of The Church of Satan, I would be appauled that this is an attempt at representing my beliefs. It is simply and utterly shallow."
1,"A Wretched ""Translation""","The Modern Library ""translation"" by Burton Raffel of THE RED AND THE BLACK is actually a vulgar, anachronistic retelling of Stendhal's novel. I recall abandoning it in disgust when the main character refers to his life as a total ""blast"". MTV was obviously very popular in 1830 France.Instead, the brilliant Moncrieff translation, as revised by Stendhal scholar Ann Jefferson, is highly recommended (Everyman paperback, ISBN 0460876430).June, 2011 update: Just read the translation Roger Gard did for Penguin just before his untimely death. It is accurate, fluent, free of Briticisms and has excellent and extensive notes. Highly recommended!"
4,Precarious status of possession,"I must say that learning about the 19th century French history helped me to understand the historical context of this book, which definitely added more depth to and appreciation for the psychology of the characters. This if kind of French/male version of Vanity Fair--social commentary on the ironies and hypocrisies of the culture--an ambitious social climber from low class, high class women whose lives are dying from boredom, churches and politics all exploiting one another for self preservation and promotion. And the worst obstacle in this game is genuine human feelings which ultimately lead to destruction. Most chapters have poignant quotes that add dark, satirical, often very funny delight to the following stories, ""Everyday events are so grotesque they keep yo from seeing the very real misfortune of our passions--Barnave"", ""Words have been given to men in order to hide their thoughts--R.P. Malagrida"" After this book, I will definitely plan on reading Voltaire."
2,BLAH!,"Cheesy, boring and predictable - ""Bushwhacked Bride"" was much better. Except for Ma Reklaw (now called Grandma) the other repeat characters seemed to have had lobotomies since the prequel. ""Phantom of the Bathtub"" is by far Ms. Riley's best in my opinion."
4,Adult Ministries that are Great for any denomination,This is a great book about Christian Education for Adults. It is exactly the every church needs to have about their adult ministries. This is where the church should be heading. Even if you are a Protestant this book still has excellent advice that is universal. It is definitely a great read with good writing and excellent vocabulary.
1,Did not work..........,"I thought this was a great price for the product, it was exactly what my husband needed for a project we were doing. When he got the level out and set it up according exactly to the directions, it would not make a level line on the wall! That's it's only job! He tried to correct it according to directions, did not work.We ended up returning it for a refund. Merchant (Anytime Tools) was rather timely to issue our refund which was very appreciated, however we had to pay out of our own pocket to ship it back to them, and were NOT reimbursed.....I don't really agree with that.Would not buy this product or others from this merchant again. Many others will provide a postage paid label for returns or at least reimburse you for shipping, but not them."
3,"Great for soups and ramen, wish it had more features","This is great for soups and ramen which are better than a lot of other boilers which only boil water. However, I wish that it turned itself off automatically after boiling so that I don't have to watch it and have it accidentally boil over or end up checking it every 5 minutes. It's also difficult to wash due to the placement of the cord."
4,Great for the price,"I purchased this to boil water for tea in my office and it fits the bill perfectly.I own a few electric kettles and this one is the true basics. It has no automatic shut off so if you forget you're boiling water it will just keep on going until it burns out which can be a bit dangerous, so keep an eye on it when you're using it. It also can be kind of hard to open the top, but that's not too big a deal. All in all it does just what I wanted for what I wanted to spend. I'd recommend it to others."
2,Not last long...,I donot like it because it only lasted for a few months of use..... Try other brand!!! Donot recommended to anyone!!!
1,QUIT WORKING,"I am on my second pot and will not get a third. I am on Amazon looking for a different brand. My first one quit working after a week, so I returned it thinking it was defective and after two weeks with the new one I have found out that it is the model not the pot. WASTE WASTE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!"
2,Threw this away last week,"We only used this to boil water. I guess we weren't careful enough with it, because almost immediatley it started getting rust around the edge of the heating element. It would wipe off, but then rust started developing all over the heating element."
3,Two things you should know,"I may have an earlier model, but two things have always concerned me:1) The cord will get warm quickly and hot over time; this usually means that an insufficient gauge of wire was used (it needs a thicker cord)2) If you pull the cord out to turn it off (usually we dial it down to zero, then unplug it) it will trip a GFCI outlet.It is, however, what it is: an inexpensive electric pot. For as much as my wife's used this, we've gotten 5 or 6 times what it was worth out of it, but from a company like Rival, it really should have a heavier cord and (though it's overkill) a grounded (3 prong) connector as well."
1,Rust!,I had owned a Rival Hot Pot Express for over 7 years and the only problem I had with it was mineral build-up on the heating plate and then over time the plastic on the inside got a little scratched up and was getting difficult to clean. So I decided to buy a new one. I saw the reviews referring to a rust issue but decided to ignore it since I had one of these units for over 7 years and never had a rust problem. Big mistake. I've had the unit now for only about 2 to 3 weeks and this morning noticed rust forming around the edges of the heating element just as the other reviewers noted. I had even been careful not to leave water in it overnight. Do not waste your money.
2,No on-off switch,"I've had one of these for years, which proves they can last a long time. It heats water very fast and has a huge opening, so you can't spill stuff you pour into it. The downside is that there is no on-off switch. The result is that you have to unplug it to turn it off and plug it in to turn it on! I ended up installing an in-line switch on the cord, which works fine, but which took some effort and a few bucks to do. There are other equally good hot pots with built-in on-off switches. I recommend getting one of those."
1,rusty heating element,"I had this product for about 2 months before the heating element started to rust. It does heat up water very quickly, but who wants to drink rusty water?"
4,Great useful little thing,"This product is designed for a simple task - boiling water - and it does this task perfectly.The product does not come with an on/off switch, so you have to manually unplug the unit from the wall socket after the water boils."
2,Who designed this?,"This would be a great unit, but whoever designed it put the spout higher that the rim. It is almost impossible to pour out of it without spilling. Otherwise, it is quite reliable...."
2,"Yes, but no","The hot pot worked great--I could use it at my desk at work to heat up water for a cup of tea super-fast (under 2 minutes). However, the heating element died after just a few months! I am really upset--I hate heating up water in the microwave, but I love my cup of tea. I am searching for a similar item, but one better made than the Rival hot pot."
3,What kind of plastic is this pot made of??,"Some plastics are toxic to the human body (i.e. Bisphenol A (BPA) and leach out into the food and water. Even though this pot works well, I'm thinking of getting rid of it since it does not specify what kind of plastic it is made of."
2,"Great kettle, but don't put any water in it or it'll rust up in a snap","This kettle was cheap and it'll boil your water. Be careful not to put any water in it or it'll rust and you'll consume all sorts of exciting chemicals. It hasn't killed me yet, so it dodges the one-star rating."
1,leaks and has to be plugged out,"i wanted an electric kettle, but landed up ordering this as i thought this was multi-functional and could be used to boil eggs etc as well. While it is muli-functional; 2 biggest irritatiosn are:- it has to be plugged out - i cannot just press a button for it to stop heating. I literally has to be plugged out. That reduces the functionality and safety of this product. bit of an irritation in a busy kitchen.- it leaks... within one week of using it, I noticed it leaks water while boiling and also leaks if there is any water left in it... Cleaning mess adds to the list instead of reducing it..."
1,Lasted one week,"This electric water pot lasted for one week of use. Some metal internal part started to show rust which was bad enough, but then the cheap and flimsy plastic cracked due to the heat and I had to throw this away. At least it only cost me $10, but still, products this bad should not be made in the first place."
4,Rival Hot Ppot Express 32 oz,"I purchased the Rival Hot Pot to make tea. It is quicker than using a panon the stove. It is much neater to pour from because of the spout.I live with my daughter, and this is nice to keep in my room. It is alwayshandy."
5,Great hot pot,This hot pot exceeds my expectations in all ways. I have made tea twice a day ever since I got it and still am amazed how fast the water heats. It's perfect for making tea.
5,Expensive at Amazon,You can get the generic version of this for $10 by driving to your local Target.
2,It's good....for a while,"We use the Hot Pot in the office and it does indeed heat water really fast. The problem is that after only a few months (less than a year) of ownership, it started leaking like crazy. I guess we'll have to get another one. I'm glad it's cheap."
1,Do Not Buy This Hot Pot,"Pros: Fast boiling waterCons: Rusting and Peeling kept developing from nonstick plate after first use.Rusts and Peelings came from the nonstick plate inside after first time of boiling water.The Non-stick plate was not Teflon coated.The corn-flake peelings from the plate came out every time you boil water. In addition, the pot does not have ON/OFF Switch.I could not believe a reputable company like Rival making such aninferior product."
1,Leaks!!!,"I bought this pot based on the great reviews. I love that it opens wide up and you *can* cook things in it (like mac n cheese--although I never did). I used mine solely for heating up water for tea and coffee when we travel. Again, I love that it's small enough for what I need it for, and doesn't take up much space in my suitcase. But upon using it for only the 2nd time, the thing leaks all over the place. It mostly leaks through where the cord enters the kettle, but also a little water is dripping through where the bottom of the pot is vented to allow air to cool the motor. So, it doesn't seem safe to use. Mine is less than a year old, so I'll try to return if there's any sort of warranty, but I'm not too hopeful. Huge bummer (and it also has a pretty strong odor of plastic, as other reviewers have mentioned too)."
2,"""You get what you pay for.""",There is a loose electrical contact in this new utensil. You have to jiggle the power cord before it starts to heat up.
2,silver and white specks floating in water,I've used this for about 6 months and just noticed these white and also silver flecks floating in the water. Tried cleaning it - no difference. What's up with that???
2,I love it for keeping tea hot - not so much anymore,"I have had a West Bend hot pot for many years which died recently. I bouthg anther of the same and it was just horrible. I then ordered this one, and I am very happy with it. I have used it about 10 times. It has adjustable temperature, but seems to be pretty hot no matter what. I use it only to make tea, it gets hot quickly, then cools down a bit but stays hot enough to keep my tea hot as long as I want to. It spills when pouring but I just don't pour as quickly and it is fine. I also don't want it to automatically shut off and this one doesn't shut off until I tell it to. Bonus for me.UPDATE: Have had for a few months and I'm not thrilled. Often boils over even on the lowest setting, and I can't pour out water without spilling. Does the job but makes a mess."
1,Flaky and Rusty,"Heats up great. Very fast. However, a rust spot developed in one area around the heating element. (It could have been due to my leaving water in the kettle overnight. ???) But then white stuff started flaking off, appearing in my drink. Certainly not going to drink that!"
4,"Money well spent, lasted 10 years","This hot pot just stopped heating today after 10 years of use.It has strange triangular headed screws on the bottom so I am unableto diagnose the death.Cons:No off switch, must be unplugged to turn offNot good at simmering.Nonstick wears out quickly.Pros:Works well for boiling, very fast boil.Great for the money."
1,Leaks after time -- THIS CAN'T BE SAFE!,"I've had one of these for over a year. About twenty minutes ago I heard a dripping sound and saw water coming out of WHERE THE ELECTRICAL CORD CONNECTS. I am no electrician but there is NO WAY THAT CAN BE SAFE. Stay far, far away. I'll be buying a Zojirushi to replace this deathtrap."
1,Not for me....,"This pot gets great reviews, but I didn't like it. If you don't dry out the inside of the pot thoroughly after each use, the area where the nonstick surface meets the plastic will quickly develop a ring of rust. Also, if you try to open the pot when there is any water in it, the lid is so tight that it splashes out.I returned mine....but if you order one, my best advice is to keep the inside dry. I can see where this would be great for camping or dorm use."
5,Great hot pot,"This was a gift for someone who prepares coffee in a coffee press. She loves this pot. Only thing she would change is the size. It could be a bit smaller for her purposes, but it works great to get the water to ""just right"" for the coffee process."
5,great,Heating water is fast and easy. It takes less heating in the hot pot express than the microwave. It is also better than using the kettle on the stove top. This will be a great item for my son to use in college for heating soups and noodles.
3,alright i guess,"This device was hard to clean, i found myself just leaving stuff inside of it and not cleaning it.it heated ok, it was an alright option when i didn't have a stove, but its not going to replace boiling water."
4,"Heats Water Quickly, but...","I am a tea junkie, and this pot is invaluable at work. We can heat many cups of water quickly, instead of microwaving them. It is also easy to clean, lightweight, and economical.However, if I could, I would change two things about this product.1) It has no on-off switch. You have to unplug it to turn it off. I'm afraid that one day I will forget and burn the office down.2) Something is wrong with shape of the spout, I don't know what it is. When the water is boiling, and you pour it out, it spills all down the side of the pot and makes a mess. I know that molecular attraction causes cohesion whenever you pour water out of anything, but this is extreme, and does not occur when you pour cold water out of this pot. I have no idea how to fix it, I just know it is annoying."
4,"A good, no frills water kettle","Mine is more than four years old, used almost daily, and is still going strong. I accidentally left it on for hours with or without water for a couple of times, but it never burned out on itself or caused fire. If you're looking for a water kettle that boils water quick and convenient, especially in dorms where you can't use a stove to boil water, this is highly recommended. The only drawback is that because there is no on/off switch, you have to plug/unplug it to start/stop boiling. I never used it for cooking, so I can't say anything about the longevity of the nonstick bottom in case you cook something on it, but the nonstick in mine is as good as new."
1,Not healthy!,"Bought this product and yes, it heats up water. However, the heating device on the bottom of the kettle emits a rusting by-product every time i boil water. I've given it a chance....had it a month now hoping it will stop. It hasn't. This rusty by-product has even stained the inner walls of the kettle. In addition to this, which should be enough not to buy it, this kettle was designed with no on/off switch and it is annoying to have to unplug the device to turn it off."
3,"Starter kettle, great low-cost solution, but when you can upgrade, you will.","It was a great little starter kettle, but it takes forever to boil water, even just a little bit. (At least, it feels like it when you're waiting for it to boil). It doesn't have auto-off, either, and after I'd left it on all night twice in a week, I decided that was a little too dangerous. Couple that with water leaking from under the lid (thereby making a mess) whenever you try to pour a little too quickly, and the little black bits that were beginning to come off the bottom of the hot pot, and this kettle is being retired after not quite 18 months of service."
4,"well, it still works","ok, it doesnt have an on/off switch. and its not handy for heating anything but water. but for just that, it is pretty effective and quick."
1,Plastic taste is gross,"I bought this to boil water for tea. The plastic taste has persisted. I contacted the company and was advised to soak water and vinegar in it. No improvement. This product is in my opinion unusable, unless you enjoy the taste of plastic."
1,Broke after a few weeks.,The hot plate on the bottom melted after a few weeks and the water heater leaked water everywhere. Don't buy this water heater.
1,Stopped working after 1 yr.,"We actually had 2 of these. The first one-- the plastic pot cracked after 2 weeks, and we got a replacement as an exchange. The replacement worked great for 14 months, and it died suddenly. We've been taking good care of it, boiling water 2-3 times per day for tea, noodles, etc... The water boiled really fast while it worked."
2,Scared me away,"I opened up the PDF owners manual seeking the wattage/amperage information. Not there! Not a good sign. Then I noticed it said ""printed in China"" -- of course. This explains the low price too. That is when I stopped buying this product. Anything I eat or drink should *not* come from China! I have to assume the plastic contains some terrible chemical they are disposing of by including it in the material. That's what they do over there, which may be fine for tires, but not something used to prepare food!"
5,Great Service,This was a good experience. Merchandise delivered in excellent time frame.Thank you very much. N
2,Rival 4071WN 32-Ounce Hot Pot Express,I bought this item in October and received it Oct. 24. I've been using it to heat water for tea once or twice a day. It worked great ... for three weeks. It quit working Nov. 12.
2,bait & switch?,"I ordered a $14 Rival hot pot to replace a 25 year old one I had ruined, there were cheaper pots on Amazon but this one was the best of a poor lot of reviews. Sunbeam pots were cheaper but reviews were bad. Shipping time was a little slow and I received a Sunbeam pot. I looked back on Amazon and the Rival pot was now $19 and the Sunbeam pot were gone! Found that they were made by the same company. The sides of the spout extended back preventing the lid from closing. What are these poeple thinking about? I filed the spout to alow the lid to close. I am through with Hot pots and this company. Found that both brands are made by Jardin."
1,stay away from this pot,"the pot i bought has leaked rusty water from day one. even if that were not a problem,the pot has no on-off switch, and the spout is awkward to pour from, so i always endup making up a mess in addition to the mess from the leaks. stay away from this potunless your aim is to water your furniture."
2,A piece of junk!,"Don't listen to the people who just bought it and think it's great.I've had this product for roughly 6 months. Soon after I started usingit, white flecks of unknown stuff started appearing in the water. Atfirst I thought it was due to our hard water, but I've read this is acommon complaint.Despite this, it heated water up quickly and seemed to work fine..until recently. It began giving off an odd burning plastic smell andthe heat was much weaker. I checked to make sure it was dry and noloose wires, but it seems physically normal. In any case, I'll notuse it again as it could become a fire hazard. Get a better model. This onemay be cheap, but it's also junk!"
3,Good for the Price,"Has a nice capacity and a non stick bottom. I usually do not pour liquid directly into the hotpot. What I usually do is put some water on the bottom and place my microwaveable/oven proof bowl inside. It heats very quickly and gets extremely hot within seconds. My only complaint is the noise. I use it at work and the whole office can hear when I'm using my hot pot. If it wasnt for that I would have given it at least 4.5 stars. The other issue is the lid staying closed. It sometimes pops up when the steam builds. In general though, a nice little hot pot to have."
5,Rival hot pot express,"I had just ordered it, because my other one just broke and i was highly impressed as i received it in 2 days. i use it for tea and i have to have my tea. It works like a charm and the water heats up so fast-no wait. I am highly satisfied with the service and the product!"
2,"Yum, yum, rusty water","I loved it before it began rusting after a few months. Yes, it's inexpensive, but it's just idea of having to replace it that is annoying. It does heat water quickly, though."
1,Started leaking after one week,The device started leaking after one week of normal usage. To tell the truth I was already puzzled when it arrived as I was imaging other kettle (bigger and more solid) but that was ok accounting for price. But when it started leaking - I do not recommend buying it.
2,hot pot strikes out at Amazon,"I bought my hot pot in June 2010. By April of 2011 it was showing signs of trouble. In May it decided when it wanted to heat water and when it didn't. By June it was dead. Guess they just don't make them like they used to.Also, the cord was so short as to make the unit difficult and dangerous to use.So sorry to see this ""classic"" appliance be thrown under the bus. My previous Hot Pot lasted years and years. Something has changed internally and the customer is footing the bill."
2,"The first 10 uses were fine, but then . . .","I bought this at a higher price than what is now advertised. It was good for making Top Ramen (directly in the hot pot), or boiling water, etc. Lately it has started making odd buzzing sounds and then it started leaking the hot water all over the countertop, so it's going to be thrown away. After only about 10 uses, I will have to buy another kind of electric kettle. It could just be that mine had a defect . . ."
2,You get what you pay for,"The hot pot is good in that it will bring water to boiling rapidly. I have not used it to heat anything else so I won't comment on how easy it is to clean or resist stains. It has no on /off switch, the there is a control that can range from hot to hotter to too dang hot, there is no automatic shut off, it may get kind of Western if it boils dry. My biggest complaint, and one of safety, there is a large spark created when unplugging the thing."
1,Where has quality gone ?,"I've been using one of these for several years now, so long in fact that the cover eroded away and the handle broke. Finally, I took the time to order a new one and pitched the old one away.The new hot pot was in use for 2 months before it began leaking. A quick disassembly shows that the metal heating element is simply pressed on the plastic bottom and if not assembled properly will eventually leak.I won't take a chance on purchasing another one - time to try a competitors product and see if their quality control does a better job than Rival's."
5,The College Cooker,"This new version of the hot pot is a must have for anyone living in the dorm. You can fix just about anything in it, not just hot chocolate. I bought my daughter two of them and she and her roommate use them for just about everything and so do their neighbors. They fix all kinds of pasta, rice, soup, tea...you name it. It really does heat up quickly and is simple and safe to use. I recommend it to everyone going off to college. It makes it easy and inexpensive to have a hot meal."
1,Died...quickly.,"This thing only lasted a couple of months. I only ever used it with water and took awesome care of it. It was never submerged or anything. Only boiling water in it, I didn't even need to clean it. Well, it no longer heats up and now occupies my trashcan awaiting trash day. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Started leaking after a few months,"I purchased one of these pots and used it occasionally for about 9 months. By occasionally I mean maybe 2 dozen times since I don't drink hot tea in warm weather.This morning it sprang a huge leak and water was gushing out around the electrical cord.Sadly, I just ordered another one of these a few days ago for my office. Looks like that was a mistake."
2,Broke down in 6 months,Purchased this producet not even 6 months ago and it just stopped working. It worked out well for me while it lasted. It was a little on the flimsy side though.
1,Beware!,"The metal heating ""plate"" or heating element as some would call it is surrounded by plastic, this entire unit is plastic except for the heating element. first of all, plastic + heat= chemicals leaching out into your boiled water which some studies indicate it can lead to cancer. Also the heating element rusts and will eventually melt the plastic it is surrounded by.I actually owned one of these so I can tell you first hand about the terrible quality.Pro's:+low price+heats water very quicklyCon's:-not BPA free-cheap quality-will rust-melts the plastic if it gets too hot. you must unplug it immediately!-lasted only 3 months of daily use"
2,Disposible Junk - Not worth buying,"This worked very well for a month of daily use. Then it started to leak because the heating plate came loose from the plastic body. I couldn't clamp it back together, even with a heavy duty wood clamp. The poor quality is now clear. I learned my lesson and am going to do some more research on my next hot pot. It will be worth the extra money up front to get something metal that will work for years instead of filling up landfills with this junk."
1,Stopped heating after 12 uses.,This pot worked fine for about 12 times then stopped heating. It never had anything in it except water.Unless you need a white plastic pot for watering your plants don't waste your money on this.
2,Could be better,"I bought one of these and the first time I filled it with water, I was left with a counter covered in water. The seal wasn't tight on the hot plate. Needless to say, it is cheap for a reason."
2,From am a COLLEGE student...,"I am college student and thus far have used the hot pot express pretty frequently. I have made much pasta and soups, as well as, hot water. After a year and a half I have concluded that this product sucks. In fact it almost set my dorm on FIRE. The product does not have a on/off switch so you have to constantly plug/unplug the device. This caused much concern because it proves to be a fire hazard (which in fact it did). All in all, the product heat and boils. However, the rust build up is a great health concern. I would not recommend buying this garbage."
5,Love it!,"I use it for cooking soup/noodles. I love the fact that it takes only 1~3 minutes to boil the water. The top lid falls off easily, although that doesn't bother me. It last for about 1 year before it starts leaking a bit. I'm not sure if it was the way I used it or it's just worn out. Overall, I love this product and I will buy it again."
4,"works fast, but gets dirty quickly","heats water up very quickly. the whole thing just has a cheap feel to it so if you want to take it to work it works great, but if I were to get one for the house, I'd get something that looks better. cleaning it up is also kind of a mystery to me so I don't push my luck ."
4,Rival hot Pot Express,"my wife was looking for a small pot to heat her water for tea and other things,I looked the Rival pot up on Amazon saw the Rival pot said this is the one.The Rival pot has worked out very well.It should have an off position,as with no fault socket ,it has a temdency to trip the socket breaker when the pot plug is plugged in!"
5,Love this product!,"I bought this based on a previous review posted here about how it was great to take traveling. LOVE this product. It heats faster than micro, easy to clean, nice looking, well worth the price. My only complaint is the short cord. Haven't taken it on the road yet but can see how it would be easy to do so since the WHOLE LID opens (unlike a traditional teapot) to stash other items inside and keep packing compact for travel. Highly recommend this product. I hope they make it for many years to come. Love the ability to change heat setting."
3,Adequate,"I purchased this kettle from Amazon since it was on the order of $10 and I was on a tight budget.I must say that for its purpose, this little kettle definitely works well if all you want to do is boil water and/or warm up liquids. It heats water up in times fairly quickly in an amount of time you won't really notice.However, I must say that this kettle only meets your bare minimum requirements. The kettle has a short chord, which means you need to have an extension chord / wall socket nearby. This means your table can't be too far (or too high) from a power source. Furthermore, the kettle is made of plastic which feels cheap-ish and flimsy; I'm not even sure if the plastic was meant to withstand boiling water and not melt slightly. Just something that bothers me."
2,hot pot???,the hot pot did not automatically turn off when the water boiled. i didn't know that i was purchasing a non controlled hot pot.
1,Recommend you don't buy this product,"I bought this and don't like it. I saw the low price and thought all hot pots are the same, so bought it. It took me five minutes to realize my mistake. It doesn't have an on/off switch. If it's plugged in, it's on. It will stay on all night if you forget to unplug it. I think it's a fire hazard and am surprised you can actually sell something like this. It's just a safety necessity to have a pot that turns off automatically after it reaches the boiling point."
2,Note to manufacturer....Defective heating element,"I bought a Rival hot pot almost 10 years ago from QVC and it was a great product. it wasvery well made with thick plastic and was very well constructed, unlike the one in the picture. I recently bought a replacement for it from Target. It did not have the Rival name on it but it looks exactly like the one in the picture and it has what I assume is Targets brand (Chefmate)on it. This item heats great but I have noticed that it will inadvertantly cut off and after several uses the large round heating element inside the pot will separate from the plastic, surrounding it, resulting in leakage from the bottom of the pot. This is a defect that needs to be corrected before a serious incident results from what is an obvious design flaw. How it got past quality control is a curiosity. obviously this product is a result of someone making a decision to cut cost by making an inferior product. Tsk, tsk."
3,"The Masque of the Red Death(1964,Vincent Price)","This Roger Corman Film Adaption of the Book By Edgar Allen Poe(I have yet to read the book)is Okay good,the only reason to watch it is for Vincent Price,the movie can be over dramatic and boring, The Imagery and this type of stuff I don't care for.*Spoiler*: ..but I like the Ending and How fitting it was for those who think they can escape death."
2,Hidden garbage,"The only thing masked by this movie is content/enjoyment. I always loved Vincent Price but this is one of the worse movies I have ever seen but comes from one of the best short stories. They really destroyed a good piece of literature with this. It's absolutely ridiculous. Very little, if anything, other than the title is true to the original literature. Please don't waste your money. Building a little fire and watching your money burn would be more enjoyable."
2,Bad tape. Oh well.,"Well, the tape doesn't play well at all, but it does play. I guess I got what I paid for, as it was extremely cheap. If I need a good copy, I'll buy the dvd."
5,"Fun little book , beautiful pictures & illustrations","This is a great book for the model boat builder. Step by step instructions with great color pictures at each step. The model is built just as the full sized version. I have built several of these skiffs. Each one came out very nicely. They are easy to modify to the individual modelers needs. All you need is some good clear white pine or white cedar and a small table saw to make your ""lumber"" for the boat. Most of it is simply 3/32"" by 1/2"" strips. You glue them together with Titebond or Elmers, clamp them with clothes pins then wipe all the excess away. Next the author gives some great painting tips! Easy and fun!"
5,A Great Album With An Upbeat & Positive Girl Focus,My 5-year-old daughter LOVES this CD with its lively dance beat! I LOVE the positive lyrics and the respectful content which portrays girls as people with aspirations and feelings rather than objects. All girls should be exposed to these kinds of messages more often. This CD is extremely hard to find in retail stores in my area. This is truly a great album!
5,"Barbie,Christie and Teresa are cool!!","Hi,my name's Fulliem.I'm 16 yrs.old.This album ""Beyond Pink""it's SUPER cool!I don't have it on CD,but I have it on cassette.My most favesong is ""WonderLand"",which is sung byeveryone's fave girl,Barbie.I likeALL the songs.But on my opignion""WonderLand"" is the best.I always play it in my cassette player.I also think taht Mattel,should makeanother Barbie album."
4,Very good CD..my 4 yr old loves it!,I cannot believe that you put a review on here that has the F word in it! I thought your policy was to edit and/or not show reviews that were obviously not factual! I will no long use your service until this is corrected!
5,I love this grinder!,"I love this grinder! I bought it to grind seeds and spices and stuff. I have a coffeemaker with a grinder built in, but if I didn't, this would be PERFECT. I love it to make my own taco seasoning, flax seed powder, and tons of other things to cook with. I would recommend this to anyone. It doesn't take up much room and it super easy to clean."
5,Reliable long service,"I am buying my second after a decade of every day (or more) use. I agree with paxbear's review, and advise the user to keep one sushi stick for cleaning the interior. First loosen the grounds with the stick, empty into your brewer, then use the stick again to clean out the edges and around the blade housing. I settled on a sushi stick after finding it easy to manipulate. Save a SMOOTH stick for obvious reasons. And I also discovered that the lid makes for an excellent measuring device and you can calibrate it with little marks if you wish for various cups.Forget the complex. This grinder DOES THE JOB."
5,Krups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder,"I have had this Krups grinder for 3 weeks. Works well, fast grinding. Cleaning is fairly easy if you use a dry paper towel. I have had a similar Krups ginder for > 10 years. It sees occasional use and works well.Very easy ordering process, fast delivery.I enjoy and use/value the reviews submitted by Users on Amazon. So please submit reviews."
4,A good grinder for the money,"I purchased this grinder as a travel accessory, and it will do me quite well. I was quite impressed with the quality that went into this grinder at an extremely inexpensive price. It does what I need it to do quickly and effortlessly with very little cleanup. I do, howver, recommend a small brush for sweeping away coffee grounds that accumulate under the blade.Though this is a good grinder, I only recommend it for the casual coffee drinker. There are no variable settings for courser or finer grounds, so this unit ends up providing somewhat of a happy medium. The grounds are just fine enough so that they don't quite work ideally with a French Press, but they are ideally suited for a paper filter drip coffee maker.If I wasn't so particular about how I like my morning coffee, this would definitely be my every day grinder. On the road, this grinder is one of my essential carry-alongs that I simply cannot do without."
4,Great buy!,This is a great little grinder! It is pretty quiet and does a great job grinding coffee beans. I do need to brush it out as some of the coffee sticks to the sides. I would definitely purchase this item again. I wish the color red had been an option when I purchased this a few months ago!
5,Works great!,"I have never used a coffee grinder before and was skeptical about how well it would work. I could not be more pleased with the Krups coffee grinder; it grinds the coffee well, it fits in my cupboard easily, and it cleans up like a breeze."
4,krups,"Seems to be a solid piece of equipment so far,only have used it around 10 times but doing the job."
5,a great coffee grinder,Works great. all i do is count to 10 or 12 and the grounds are in great shape to brew and perfect cup of coffee.
4,Great Item,"I got this as a gift for my mom. She didn't want a large grinder as she is the only one in her household that drinks coffee. But she needed a new one. So far, so good."
4,Great little grinder.,"Small, sturdy and powerful.Low tech, easy to clean.Perfect size for the one or two person household-coffee beans AND spices!"
2,Stupid Design Flaw for Simple Product,"Bummer - I had my old one for at least 10 years but this one has an OVAL reservoir for blades which of course spin in a perfect CIRCLE, so the coffee gets ground too fine and gets stuck in the ends of the oval. This is why others have complained about the sludge in their coffee. The obvious solution would have been to make the reservoir ROUND, not OVAL. You end up having to use a brush to get out the ultrafine coffee trapped in the ends of the well. Truly idiotic, especially for a company like Krups, which traditionally made such beautiful products. So, I'm looking for another new one now. At least it wasn't horribly expensive, but still....."
2,Changes made to internals?,"We have had a Krups coffee grinder in the office that has been used for many many years. The blade has become dull, so we decided to order a new Krups grinder. The first one lasted only a few days, the second one maybe a few weeks, and now the third one has finally died after a few months. The grinder gets used a lot -- roughly 20 times a day. But our old one is still going, after being used what must be a thousand times.Did something change in the new Krups grinders? They have the exact same externals - but the motor must be different. Luckily they have a 1 year warranty, but what's the point if I have to continue to return them?"
1,Poor construction,I bought this grinder more than one year ago. I do not make much coffee so it has had little use. The blade attachment is made of plastic and the plastic broke about 3 months ago. With gluing it back together I was able to make it work again but not for long. It probably didn't last through 20 grindings. I find no place to order another attachment. I do not recommend this grinder.
5,Best Blade Grinder Next to a Burr,"This is the next best thing to a Burr Grinder. If you don't want to pay for or can't afford to get a burr grinder this little gem is the next best thing. I have had this grinder for almost 4 years. I use it religiously every day, twice a day on weekends and more during holidays and when family is visiting and it's still performing at the same level it did on the day I bought it. It will blade grind your coffee to a nice fine grind and is the closest to a burr grind you will find in a blade unit. It doesn't have settings so you really have to rely on the amount of time you depress the switch to get the type of grind you want, longer for finer and shorter for coarser. If you're looking for a quality, affordable blade grinder I highly recommend this unit."
4,Christmas gift,I got this as a Christmas gift for my son in law. I dont know if he has used it yet but I havent heard any complaints.
3,This was a wedding gift purchase,"This was not a purchase for myself, it was for a wedding gift that Macy's did not have in stock, so I honestly cannot rate the item, but I can say that it got to my house in the time frame stated."
4,Works great.,"Just what I wanted. It grinds coffee. The grind is a little uneven, but I still really enjoy my coffee. Works a lot better than my last one."
2,Exception to the Rule,"I bought this grinder based on the positive reviews. I bought in October, and sad to say, it died in July. It worked great while I had it!"
2,Not a real grinder,"Pro: easy to use, smallCon: 1) not cordless 2)not evenly grinded 3) not easy to get the coffee power out of the grinder, not easy to clean.Buy a real grinder, not this type."
2,"Impossible to clean, smells of burnt wire","The blades don't come off... the cup is deep, so cleaning this is MORE of a hassle, than grinding yourself.ALSO it smells when running... like burnt wire."
4,Perfect,"I love this coffee grinder. It is well designed. However, I have gone through 4 grinders in 6 years. The grinder is easily damaged when dropped, even a short distance (12 inches). I have not been able to get replacement parts. Which is why I have gone through 4 grinders in 6 years. This grinder does a great job, when handled with care. The other Krupps grinders seem to be appearance motivated than performance motivated."
4,Great grinder,"Grinds quickly and very fine. As I like my coffee ground almost to dust for maximum strength. This does a great job. A bit louder than my old Hamilton -Beach. Can do up to a 6-8 cup grind at 1.25 tablespoons to a cup. My TraderJoes coffee is a bit oilier than others, so it does stick some on the bottom as it is ground. Great grinder."
4,Does the job and is affordable.,"I've had a Krups for years with no problem at all. Before the Krups, I had another brand and the blades broke. I bought this for a gift, just right for someone who likes coffee. Also, it is less expensive than most others. In this case, THERE IS a difference when you grind your own beans. It only takes a minute and the outcome is much better coffee. Go Krups. You won't be disappointed"
5,Quick Grinder!,"We ordered this Coffee Grinder after our previous one finally quit working. We had a Braun and it worked good, however the Krups is a much better grinder for coffee. The Watts are 200 compared to 150 on the Braun. The Krups was hands down more powerful. My husband is very happy with it. It is well worth the price!"
5,Great!,This is a great grinder! We loved it so much that we got one as a gift (along with a coffee press) for my mom!
4,very good coffee grinder,very easy to use and very powerful. cleaning is a little cumbersome. sometimes the coffee powder gets stick with the bowl.
3,"Runs well, but inconsistent","I've used it thrice, and so far it's working alright. But don't get this grinder if you need any kind of consistency to your grind -- e.g. you're using a French press or cold brew. After pressing the button for a few seconds, I've ended up with still intact beans along with grounds that were too fine all in the same batch together (sort of like when your hot pocket comes out of the microwave steaming hot on the outside and ice cold on the inside). It also doesn't have a huge capacity -- about 3 ounces or so."
4,Powerful grinder,This is a powerful grinder and makes fast works of our tasks. We have been using it to make our own garlic powder and chili powders from our garden harvest. Would by it again a great product.
4,I Don't Know,"The product works fine, and we have not run into any issues with it yet, but it is a pain to clean."
5,This was the perfect grinder for me.,"I purchased this grinder to use withBialetti 6799 Moka Express 3-Cup Stovetop Espresso Makerand theBonJour Frother, Automatic Battery Powered Oval with Stand, Silver. This was a great setup to make a great cup of espresso."
3,Work good as it is,"I purchased this grinder and I am happy with it's performance. It is not as powerful as the more advanced model, but it is doing what it suppose to (grind the coffee beans). You may need to hold down the button to let it grind a little longer if you put a full volume of beans in it. Longer grinding will produce finer coffee powder. Overall this product is good."
4,Great Grinder,Good coffee bean grinder. Control of grind can be controlled by pulses. Easy to clean. Great replacement for grind & brew coffee makers that don't do the job properly. Krups quality shines again. Great product for a small price.
4,noisy but good,"this one is louder than the old version i had that broke, but it works well, and looks much better ;)"
3,good; a bit unwieldy tho,"The grinder itself works well. Maybe the cord should have been on the other side (for right-handed people).. The oblong shape makes it a wider grinder, & may not be so easy for girls to use :c/"
3,great while it worked,"I've had this coffee grinder for a little over two years now. Used it about once a week to grind a week's supply of beans. It stopped working today:(. I can hear the motor turning, but the blade is either stuck or the linkage is broken. As has been said before, it only does a relatively fine grind (which I prefer), and it not super quiet (but not tremendously noisy either). I would've given it 5 stars before it stopped (does... I mean, did what I wanted it to do).Looks like I'm going to have to open it up and see if I can fix it. :("
3,Good Purchase for the Price - Craftsmanship Hmm?,The grinder is very quiet. Sounds like the motor is quality and performs great. I had to get a replacement since the base of the item was loose. That is why I rated as okay.
3,get what you pay for,"this is a very basic coffee grinder that does what the name implies....grinds coffeee. I bought it as a shared appiance for work and gets the job done. Better units have a removable base allowing for less mess, but at the end of the day, we wanted to spend our money on the beans more than the grinder."
4,A good replacement for my old Braun,"My old grinder died after many, many years of service. This Krups works well. The top is not as well designed as it could be. The top and push lever component for the grinder don't work smoothly. Perhaps the plastic needs to wear down a bit. It grinds coffee and spices well so I like it but don't love it."
4,KRUPS Coffee Grinder,Bought this to replace a Mr. Coffee grinder that was several years old and still worked. But once I used this I realized the old grinder blades were dull. This grinds the beans very fine so more flavor gets through.
5,So many reviews? How can you go wrong?,"This is one thing I could not ignore. After investigating coffee grinders, I wanted to break away and get a well designed one. This one my mom had for years.I wanted to branch out and find something different. But after comparing, this one is cheap, yes, BUT, 934 customer reviews? And still has a 4 1/2 stars? I think that speaks for itself. This product is worth every penny."
4,Buying second Krups grinder for the next 25 years of marriage.,"Actually, the first one is STILL working. We bought a second one for our son to take to college. We highly recommend KRUPS coffee grinders."
2,OK if you don't mind making a mess.,"I'm not entirely sure what the design flaw is with this grinder, but it is virtually impossible to grind beans and take the top off without grounds coming out and spreading over the counter. Not a huge deal in the scheme of things - it does do a decent job of grinding if a little unevenly, and it's cheap. You can, however, get a much better tool for the task."
2,Borker after 5 months,The grinder worked fine for 5 months (I used it every 3 weeks or so) and then stopped working. The motor whines and that's just about it.
1,Not the quality of the older Krups grinder,"I bought this to replace a 20 year old Krups grinder (same design) which was on it's last legs. Not only is this product louder than the old model, but it gives off a burning smell when grinding my beans. Had to send it back for a refund. Maybe the burning smell was just a defect of the grinder that I got, but I wouldn't want a grinder that was as loud as this one is in my kitchen."
2,Great while it lasts...,"I used this product for 2 years, mainly as a spice grinder but also occasionally for coffee beans. It grinds spices into very fine powder and worked really well ... until it broke! Now the motor makes a humming noise, but the blade does not spin. So, it's a great product while it lasts, but longevity seems to be an issue!"
5,18 years old and still grinding!!!,"I have one of these grinders I bought 18 years ago. HONESTLY. ( And we drink 2 pots of coffee a day). It has maintained perfect coffee grinding all these years. The only reason I'm needing a new one is because it was left next to a burner that had been recently turned off, and it totally melted the side of it. AND IT KEPT GRINDING!!! I just dont feel safe with a hole that size in it, and wonder if it might expedite a meeting with my maker if I dont get it replaced."
4,Works well as a spice grinder,"We dont grind coffee beans at home. Our primary motivation to buy this product was to use it as an affordable spice grinder. After a month of use, we are happy with it. It does grind very well. The motor is relatively quiet and the grinding time is short. Cleaning is not the easiest but we have cleaned worse before. Recommend this product as a spice grinder."
2,"Gets the job done, but many flaws","Original review was 4 stars simply because I wanted a working coffee bean grinder, and this did that.Purchased product in Feb 2010, and since purchase after a second or two of grinding, a typical electrical 'burn' smell emits from the device, but quickly dissipates after use. Not as bad if you aren't grinding many beans, but if you're brewing a full pot of coffee and need fine grounds, this product would literally 'stink' while it grinded. Not sure if it's a model issue or a 'dud' from a bad batch.Very intermittent use since that time frame as I was a Starbucks addict, but now finding it cheaper, more convenient and better to just home brew. After using it more frequently, I've noticed the cord is extremely short, only a 1 year warranty....i'd probably invest in a better grinder that would look better, be of better quality and possible a better warranty on my next buy."
4,nice little grinder,This grinder works very fast and can produce a very fine grind in less than 6 seconds. If you want a coarser grind then you will have to perfect your own technique as it does not have a setting for grind level. It is also relatively easy to clean.
4,"Powerful, but small.",We bought this to replace our Kitchenaid grinder that we had for years. This is really ideal for those who grind daily. My husband would rather grind his coffee just once a week instead. Wish it was a little larger. But it is not too loud and very effective!
4,Pretty decent grinder,"This grinder gets the job done very well. Its fast speed and uniquely-shaped bowl allow for as even a grind as you'll get for a portable hand-pulsed grinder. The grounds tend to stick to the bottom, but this is a problem I haven't seen one portable grinder overcome. In spite of its simplicity, it has a rather attractive look that will accent any kitchen."
2,It just blew up!,"I have had this coffee grinder for approximately 6 years and this morning it blew up. The cord, where it attached to the base of the unit is mounted in such a way as to cause friction. This caused the cord to wear at the entry point. This morning it shorted and blew up in my face. I will be looking for one that has a cord with protection where it mounts to the grinder."
2,Not fantastic for spices,I am not a coffee drinker and bought this for spices but the device does not grind fine enough. Also starts to smell of burnt lubricant after a few seconds' use. Perhaps it's a defective device.
1,Very bad design,"This grinder is somehow messy, after grinding the coffee, removing the cover split over ground coffee. Generally, it is of bad design ... indeed"
2,Lasted a little over a year!,"I bought the Krups in April of 2011 and within 13 months I am now shopping for another grinder. This time I will try a burr grinder. These blade type grinders are really crap if you care about the quality of the cup of coffee your drinking. I just did not have the money to get a burr grinder so I purchased the Krups and now the switch is bad. Looking back now, I realize I have had several blade type and most won't last or provide a decent grind. Summery--- Just purchase a burr grinder. My choice is theCapresso 565 Infinity Conical Burr Grinder, Stainless Steel. It has some great reviews and the price is under a hundred bucks. Hope this helps someone : )"
2,Good for coffee not herbs,"The unit runs great , quiet does a good job except the PLASTIC cover breaks when used with any hard seed or root type herbs. I should havd bought one with a stainless grinding cup!"
3,"works well, but design flaw","The oval design creates pockets of ground beans or seeds along the base that do not fall out of the grinder once you are finished. You have to remove them with an object or your fingers. Our previous grinder was round and we did not have this problem. Ohterwise, this grinder is very sharp and grinds things very well."
5,Works Great,Works great and works fast. Makes plenty for my 4-cup maker for 2 pots. It might not be big enough to make a full 12-cup pot.
5,Very neat,Convenient to use and it does the work! The powder is fine ground. Most of the power can be dumped out easily and not mess is created.
1,Cannot recommend this product,"The first time I used this product out of the box, it started smelling like burning plastic or rubber almost immediately.It was a very strong, unpleasant, toxic smell. There may have been a little smoke as well, it was hard to tell.I'm returning mine for Amazon store credit."
1,Broke after 6 weeks,Stopped working after 6 weeks. For the 1st 6 weeks it worked ok but really did not hold enough coffee for my 12 cup pot also it is a stupid design you have to hold it upside down or the coffee spills all over the counter top when you are done grinding.
3,Burning smell,"Pros: Pulverizes my cinnamon, quickly. Cheap, and works as advertised.Cons: Smells like burning! Emits a strong smell of burning when in use."
2,Uneven For Fine Grinding,"In fairness to the product I bought this to grind eggshells into powder (calcium source for my dog's homemade diet). I also wanted to grind dried beet pulp (same reason). Unfortunately the motor starts to get hot after just a few seconds, so I can only grind for a moment. Then stop. Then grind again, etc. If I grind even for 5 seconds I will start to smell the motor and that burning smell gets transferred to whatever I am grinding. Also, no matter how long I grind (in spurts) the end result is very uneven with about half of it powdery and the other half in granular bits."
4,Easy to use.,"Easy and quick, but grounds tend to stick to it. I think it needs a brush to get all coffee out of grinder."
5,A Houshold must!,"I have recently used this product at my niece's home, and now have it on my 'wish-list'!! What a wonderful, all-purpose grinder that can be used not only for coffee beans, but for nuts, spices and herbs and more. This product can grind as coarse or fine as one desires and is so easy to use and clean.A MUST for any well-equiped kitchen!! Yeah...and the price is RIGHT!"
4,Indestructible Coffee Grinder -- Can Survive a Nuclear War,"This is my first review for a kitchen product, but my trusty Krups Coffee Grinder deserves two thumbs up. I have used it to grind coffee to perfection: I have both drip and press coffee makers and I can use this to make different sized grounds for each. It also works well to grind nuts and to turn toast into breadcrumbs -- I have used it for both purposes. It is extremely easy to use.The only downsides to this grinder (which is why it loses a star) are (1) the base cannot be put in water, it needs to be wiped out; and (2) it lacks some of the ""bells and whistles"" of newer models. Nonetheless, I have owned my grinder for about 15 years and have been pleased with it since the day I bought it. It is nearly indestructible and will probably outlive me."
4,Espresso grinder!!!,"Do not buy this for a french press. It can't do coarse grinds very well at all! You need a burr grinder for thatDO buy this if you frequently make fine grinds for espressos.This grinder gives a perfect espresso grind! Very uniform tiny particles without any dust.For my purposes I would give this a 5 star, but for other people who don't make espresso grinds I will take off a star because you will not be very happy with gritty coffee in a french press. This really should be called an espresso grinder because that is where it shines :)I do not make drip coffee, so I can't comment on how well it works for that. My stovetop espresso maker uses grinds from this product wonderfully!"
5,a recovering Luddite,"as a bit of a Luddite, i've never had any coffee grinder other than the ""purist's"" hand-crank types which, while they look lovely and old fashioned and use no energy other than human, could wear out your muscle pretty quickly. finally i caved and got this Krups grinder when i was given a five-pound sack of whole beans. Luddite no more -- it's wonderful! takes mere seconds to grind a container full of beans to whatever fineness you wish. takes up almost no space, looks cool, works like a dream, outstanding value for the price."
4,little powerhouse,I bought it to grind flax seeds it's tiny & powerful...it does make noise but the machine makes flaxseed as fine as face powder....I love it!!
3,Coffee grinder,Pro: The grinder has worked good thus far. It grinds fast and it's relatively easy to put the beans in.Cons: hard to wash container outno measurement on the containerhard to take out ground coffee
1,Terrible Grinder,"We have owned this grinder for a little over one year, used it occasionally and it fails to start anymore. Had a slight metal smell when it used to run. Stay away from this grinder. Our old Melitta grinder is over 20 years old and has never missed a beat."
3,Only Problem is Cleaning,"We have had our Krups grinder for 3 years. It grinds very well,however cleaning it is nearly impossible. I use a stiff brush, and yet still it leaves some grinds."
1,Save your money.,"This gadget worked about 12 times, then the motor locked up. It is impossible to disassemble, so I can't tell what went wrong. Now it is a paper weight that hums. I would rate it zero if possible. Use your hard earned money to buy a different model."
3,good,For the price paid it is a good product for coffee beans but we decided to reserve it for grinding other spices.For $10 dollars more a friend acquired for us the Quisanet (sp) grinder which is a better product with varied settings.
3,useful spice grinder,"I bought this as a spice grinder and as very happy with the unit until I tried to grind cloves. The cloves left a sticky residue on the lid and damaged it so that it is now opaque. I'm not sure if there was a chemical reaction with the plastic. I had to buy a brush to clean the blade because it does not come apart for washing. I just use the brush to get out as much of the spice as possible. Sometimes, I use a damp paper towel to wipe the inside as best as possible."
5,Good Coffee Grinder,"I have never owned a coffee grinder before but this one seems to work pretty good for the price. It creats fine grounds. If you continue to leave the grinder button on it will start to create a layer of wet grounds around the inside of the grinder, but I would assume that this would be the case for any grinder because of the revolutions. Not a big problem for me. I tend to pulse the grinder through my grinding periodand shake the canister a bit. Then you can turn the grinder upside down and tap the top of the grinder on the counter to release and stuck grounds. Great buy and would recommend."
4,Compact and powerful,This is our first coffee grinder.It is small but powerful.It grinds coffee very quickly and is priced reasonably.I would reccommend to anyone who did not want to spend big bucks for all the bells and whistles.
1,Short change equals short-changed,"These grinders are indestructible. They do a great job and last forever. Why only 1 star? Krups has recently shortened the electrical cord on this appliance by 23 INCHES. Unbelievable, but true. Did they think we wouldn't notice? Did they try it out for themselves in a regular kitchen that doesn't have electrical outlets every 12"" on the counters and/or backsplash?Just how much money did they save themselves by eliminating that extra 23"" of cording? Did the customer's experience factor into the decision? The use of the grinder is severely limited when there's not enough electrical cord to reach a convenient outlet."
4,Owned this model for more than 15 years,"Got this model grinder (or at least a Krups that looks exactly like this - I admit, I don't know the model number) for a gift when I moved out of my parent's home after college. I have been grinding 8-10 cups worth of beans every day ever since. I'm 37 now - and while the grinder doesn't look very pretty after grinding thousands of pots of coffee, it's still running well.My only complaint is that the coffee tends to clump in the edges of the metal bowl below the blade if you grind it very fine - sometimes as much as a cups worth of grinds - and you need to scrap it out. To solve this, I shake the coffee maker while I'm grinding, turn it upside down while it's still spinning, and smack the side. This works well. If I didn't have to do this, I'd give it 5 Stars.However, this speaks to the durability of the model - I've been using this process most of the years I've owned this. I'm going to buy another one for my office."
3,Cracked after a month of using it.,"we were only grinding coffee for a month when a crack right in the middle of the outside plastic got a crack, the manufacture warranty sent us a replacement and we sold it on amazon. hopefully they fix that or it was just a defect. it did a nice job grinding though."
4,Ideal first grinder!,"I recently started grinding my own coffee, and this is what I got! This grinder is amazing for single cup brews. It's easy to clean and use. The compact design of the grinder makes it easy for me to store, since I have a small kitchen, and the sound levels are also very low, waking up someone at 6am isn't an issue."
3,Krup 200-Watt Motor,Bought this grinder due to the high rating on amazon. But I was a little disappointed because the electrical motor smells after continuously grinding over 30 sec for fine coffee grains.
4,Good and inexpensive coffee grinder,Great and fast coffee grinder. Four out of five stars because I had to shake the grinder in-between each pulse to get an even grind.
5,Great coffee and freshly grounded,I shopped til I found the right coffee grinder. I have not been disappointed. The coffee is not bitter and is so much better freshly grounded. The taste is smooth and delicious. The grinder is well made and I have had it for one year. I highly recommend this brand to anyone.
2,Defective product,I bought this after all the good reviews. Unfortunately the unit was giving a burning smell from the motor during operation. May be just this unit had a manufacturing defect? I returned it and Amazon refunded 100%.
2,Broke after 8 months with uneven use,"Bought this elsewhere after reading the reviews here, hoping I would have the product as long as my old grinder used for spices only (have had it almost 20 years!), and yet it broke after 8 months of inconsistent use! Krups told me to send it back for assessment and that it would take 2-4 weeks, but what do I do in the meantime?!! Ridiculous; returned it and bought a Cuisinart instead, let's hope it lasts just a wee bit longer. Why aren't things made to last anymore? Such waste for the world we leave in. Oh, gave it two stars since it worked fairly well while it did!"
3,Krups Grinder,"This is the forth one we have had. At under 20 bucks they're not too bad. We don't use it much for coffee beans. I like to make my own bread crumbs and it seems to work well for that. However, we have had them delivered with the blades bent and hitting the base, and when you shake it to move things up and down in them (they are very small) to get the contents all ""grinded"" they don't seem to like it much. I think that for something that costs less than two coffees and two bagels at a good shop and lasts over a year is just fine!"
1,"Not really for coffee, either.","I have owned this grinder for about three years and this morning I lost my temper with it and went online to Amazon and ordered a different grinder. I've had no problems with its breaking or malfunctioning but it's impossible to clean to my satisfaction. It's also difficult to add beans without my ending up chasing them all over the kitchen floor. In addition, you have to estimate the grinding time and, if you're not very careful, you end up with bitter coffee no matter how high in quality your coffee beans are. Anyone want a used grinder?"
1,Lasted (almost) two grinds!,"I got this for Christmas. My first coffee grinder! Well, the grind was not fine enough, and the second time I used it the blade broke in half. Now I have to buy an actual good grinder to experience the delicious coffee mom gave me with it!"
1,This broke in less than 2 months!,"I would NOT recommend this product. I used mine less than 2 months, averaging about once per week, and it broke last week. I am totally dissatisfied with this product. On top of that, I found out that Amazon will NOT replace it for me since it has been over 30 days. I feel that this is unreasonable. If I had purchased it at a retail store, I would definitely be able to get an exchange, if not a refund. Do NOT buy this product if you grind coffee often or if you want something that will last more than a few times!"
1,I don't understand why people rate this grinder so highly..,"I bought this grinder based on all the positive reviews.There is a serious problem with the design though. You can't remove the bowl for cleaning. So you just end up wiping it down--wasting a paper towel or dirtying a hand towel each day. Not only is this wasteful and inconvenient, it also imposes unwanted flavors into your cup of coffee, whether it be old stale coffee or spices you have ground in it.I am returning this item and will continue on my quest to find a common sense grinder--which I don't think exists."
2,DOESN'T WORK IN UK!!!!!!!!!!!!,it doesn't work in UK and it cost 44 to get an adapter!!!!!I am not happy!!!it is not worth to pay post and send it back either!!!!
1,cord is too short!,"I have had this same grinder in white for the past 10 years. I moved into a new place with stainless steel and black appliances and wanted to get the same style grinder in black or stainless to match. It arrived today and much to my dismay, the electrical plug in cord is too short! The white one I have is 40"" from base to end of plug. This new black one is only 29"", which renders it basically useless for me. I usually grind my coffee, and then pour it directly into the top of my coffee maker. The shorter cord means I would have to unplug the grinder each time, which is a real hassle. I don't see anywhere in the description a mention of the length of the cord. This is a classic example of a simple design flaw that renders the item useless. I am going to return it. Bummer, it was perfect otherwise."
1,Disaster - it burns,"I bought the Krups based upon the reviews I read on this website. It was a disaster. First, it arrived with a chip in the plastic container. Undaunted, I decided to try it. Within 3 seconds of starting the grinder, an electrical burning smell came forth and permeated the kitchen. In addition, it does not grind coffee for 15-20 cups as advertised. If you get 8 cups, you would be very, very lucky. Moreover, the coffee it made was very, very hot and weak. I returned the grinder and will look for a higher quality product."
2,Krups 203-42 coffee grinder is not for everyone,"We use our's for grinding coffee beans! WhatI have noticed is that this grinder does not provide a consistant grind for most beans. A large portion of very fine coffee lays and packs below the blade which makes it difficult for a complete grind. Once done grinding I have to use a little brush or my finger to dislodge those extra fine bean particles, I find this irritating. I will keep this grind until it breaks, which I hope will be soon."
3,KRUPS COFFEE GRINDER,It's a great grinder but you must always put your fingers in there to get all the grindings out...I would suggest a better type of silicone for quick release.I personally always have to unplug this item as it will not reach the filter so that is another pain...overall it grinds well so for that I am pleased.
2,Messy,"This grinder does its job - it grinds coffee very well, however the negatives outweigh the positives.1) There is no easy way to clean inside the grinder, so if you also need one to grind spices, I would say you'll have to get a separate unit for those tasks.2)Every time I lift up the lid, the tiny coffee grinds spill all over my kitchen counter top.I guess I'll get Mr. Coffee IDS77 for my coffee and will use Krups for spices and nuts."
2,Krups grinder-- broke after < 1 year,"I bought this grinder after reading many reviews for various grinders. I did not wish to spend more than $20. I purchased in Dec 09, and it stopped working in Aug 10. I am disappointed, but thankful I didn't spend more. I contacted Krups (manufacturer) as it is still in warranty, but I would need to ship it back to them for repair. For an item that costs <$20 new, it doesn't really make sense to ship it back... i'm sure i'll probably have to spend at least half as much to ship it.. We typically used it for seeds and spices. It stopped working while trying to grind cashews, which were soft enough.."
5,Great Blender,"This blender works great and is easy to clean and operate. A few points to consider.... If you want an espresso grind this is not the best choice. While it blends exceeding well for a normal brew, it does not get fine enough for espresso. Also if you rinse the inside out be sure to let it dry upside down as water can seep down below the blade housing and get your next grind wet if you don't dry it out fully. Neither of these is a negative and doesn't take away from the product at all."
5,All that is needed ishere for coffee grinding,"Works perfectly for my needs of coffee grind on the week-end, excellent for cone shaped filters and low noise and great price."
5,Great design...easy to use.,This is a great coffee grinder and I think I now own 2 or 3. I stay in three different locations throughout the years and I have purchased one for each place. These are hard to find at any stores so got this last one from Amazon.
3,Priced appropriately,"Not sure what I was expecting buying a ~$20 coffee grinder, but I can say it was priced appropriately. It does it job, albeit not that well. It's excessively loud, and lacks the ability to choose the ""fineness"" of grind.OF course what do you expect to $20. If I was to do it all over, I wouldnt have been so niggardly and purchased a better product!"
3,Reliable and durable,"Four years later, this thing is still working, which is great.It isn't an advanced grinder. It's not going to let you set it for a french press vs. an espresso machine. If that's what you want, you'll want something more expensive.But this was dirt cheap and it grinds coffee for a percolator very nicely, and it has lasted a very long time for me. I can't make precisely artisanal coffee using it, but it works and I'm satisfied."
4,Great little machine!,"I ordered this based on the reviews and the price. For the amount I paid for it, this is a powerful little coffee grinder. It is easy to use and does the job.The only reasons for the one-star deduction are: 1. It gives off a slight odor when you hold the grinding button down for more than a couple of seconds. I don't notice this if I just pulse on and off. 2. The capacity - if you make coffee for multiple people in the morning, you would probably have to grind beans in batches. I need to grind about 6-8 spoonfuls of beans per day, which it handles just fine."
3,Beware of plastic cover,"After years of use the bottom of the plastic cover is chipping off into the coffee. As the edge gets more ragged, the chipping increases."
3,noisy but good so far,It ground my coffee every other day and keep it in an air tight container for freshness and the oval basin for the beans seems better than the old round one I had that broke. It does what it is supposed to do. Basic and great no need for fancy gadgets. Hope that the Krups brand will hold up like it should. Just received my grinder as a gift last month but love it already and ground a bag of beans. It is a bit noisey though! I honestly thought I needed earplugs! If it wasn't for that I would have given it a 5 star rating.
3,Nothing special,"I'm not very happy about this grinder. We got it at Peets coffee for 20 bucks, and it wasnt any better than the one we last had... the worst part, is we got a very expensive Cuisinart grinder from our wedding, and it sucked too!! The nicest one that I've owned was a simple Braun grinder. I'd suggest you stick with it."
2,Some problems but great grinding action,"Great grinding action, quiet, and fast. Downfalls are hard to clean, and we have had a problem with the switch. We had trouble with the switch not turning machine on when pressed. We tried un-plugging the unit and then plugging it in again and the switch works. Nothing in the literature says to do this, but it is the only way ours will work. Would not buy another."
3,wish it had a spout,"The grinder grinds well. However, I like the type of kitchen grinder which can hold beans, grind beans, and has a spout for the ground beans to come out of-so one dosen't have to add beans every time. This grinder has to have beans put into it each time one grinds, then the ground coffee has to be emptied each time-a big hassle in my opinion. But it will be useful, due to the small size, for travel grinding, for fresh coffee on the road, one cup at a time."
3,It's alright.,"Didn't take long to ship, and was packaged nicely. The grinder works really well, grinds really smooth. The issue I have is you have to hold the button down the entire time you grind and if I grind too long it starts to smell like it's burning."
5,great for grinding,I bought this for grinding flax seeds for adding to things like oatmeal or yogurt. Easy to use and clean up.
4,Great Product for a great price,"This little bugger is great! We had a little Starbuck's coffee grinder that pooped out on us after five years that we got secondhand. But hey, if someone use me three times a day everyday for five years I'd probably quit too! This guy is amazing, though! The coffee beans are ground very finely and very quickly. It works equally well with grinding your own spices. They haven't made a silent coffee grinder yet which is the only way this grinder could get any better."
5,krups,working like a dreamawesome coffe grinderworth that moneygrinding well into very small piecesi'm very happy with it
5,Excellent for the price!!,"I'm new to the coffee drinking world and decided that i would buy this as cheap starter coffee grinder. Shipping was fast and i couldn't have asked for a better product!! Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality, cheap grinder!"
3,grinds well,"The Krups grinder works fantastic. I get my grind for my coffee pot in a matter of seconds. I'm giving this product three stars for a huge oversight. It doesn't seem to have bothered other reviewers but to me; it overshadows the grinder. The basket and blade is at the top of the grinder and the cord is at the bottom. The basket does not detach from the grinder to dump contents so you have to pick up the whole grinder to get out your coffee grinds and to clean it. I was planning on using this as my spice grinder also, which it does really well, but I have to unplug it and handle the whole thing to get my spices over to my cookware. It's awkward and annoying. I don't understand why the basket doesn't detach from the body. I just don't understand it. Seems like simple design to me."
4,The best part of waking up!,"I bought this grinder to experience fresh coffee on a college student budget. It has filled the bill and I'm very pleased. The grinder is not that noisy when in operation and the grind is pretty even, especially for a grinder that is so cheap! It is a little hard to clean out after use, but a small paint brush from the hardware store does the trick and keeps it clean, oil free, and happy."
4,Oval design not the best,"The combination of value and quality definitely makes this a grinder worth buying, but it ranks behind the Braun KSM2 because of a peculiarity in the Krups design -- its oval shape. That causes grounds to clog at one end of the grinder, where the blade juuust doesn't quite reach. You can even hear the point at which the clogging begins to affect the action of the blade. Getting the grounds out of there requires a little extra work beyond simply inverting and tapping. It's only a minor annoyance, to be sure, but it annoys me every time I use the Krups, and for that reason, I recommend you look to the Braun KSM instead."
3,quality issue,"nice looking grinder. however upon examining the inside, you will find a small gap between the metal grinder part and the plastic outer casing. I don't like that. Makes cleaning the fine powder difficult.personally I think the less fancy model by Braun KSM2 is a better model."
3,Didn't last as long as we expected,"We were so pleased when we first started using this coffee grinder. Noise level was average considering what you are actually doing, and you do have to be careful not to ""over-grind"". But the ease of use was fantastic. Unfortunately, the product lasted only two years before the motor blew. We are being optomistic and purchasing another and giving Krups the benefit of the doubt that it will last longer this time. Seems to be the best in the market for the price right now."
4,Better than Cuisinart,"Bought the Cuisinart DCG-12BC for Christmas 2008. Lasted less than 6 months just like alot of other reviewers said. The motor burned out....was used only maybe 4 times a week. I like the big stainless steel ""removable"" bowl on the Cuisinart, the look of it, pretty much everything except the fact that the motor is garbage. And without question the grind is far superior on the Krups. I didn't know any better because the Cuisinart was my first grinder but hands down the Krups is better. I DO NOT like the small bowl on the Krups nor do I like not having a removeable bowl, so it is much more of a pain to clean. Hopefully it will last much longer than 6 months. I guess we'll see. Also seems to have much more static cling than the cuisinart. All the above being said, I would rate the Krups a ""good buy""....."
4,Affordable and fairly effective,"I have been using this coffee grinder for over a year. It is small and compact which serves several purposes. First, it takes up little kitchen and storage space. Second, it keeps you grinding regularly for fresher coffee. I have enjoyed using it.Pros:- Compact- Fairly effective at grinding coffee beans- Can be used for chopping other itemsCons:- It is not as easy to clean as I would have hoped.- I would prefer an easy way to store the power cord, such as a retractable cord."
1,Krups 203-42 Coffee Grinder smells of burnt motor,"We bought the Krups 203-42 to replace the same model bought 7 years ago. The previous grinder we used avidly and enjoyed for the most part. However, this replacement smelled of burning motor (you can't mistake this smell!) on the first use and every use until I decided to return it. I'm looking for another brand."
2,Good start but watch out failed after 2 months,"I was happy. But after 2 months of normal use i.e. I only grind coffee about 4 times a week, then the motor just stopped working. I wonder if I had a defective model since there was so much praise for this elsewhere. Now I am weary. Still in the market for a great coffee grinder."
5,I have used this grinder for 30 years,"I know there are more expensive grinders and I know that there are different types of grinders. This one has been a perfect little performer for the last 30 years for me. I give this as a gift to friends who drink coffee but have not discovered the joy of fresh ground coffee.The reason I choose these grinders, they are built to last! They do an excellent job grinding coffee and spices too. They are very simply designed and easy to clean. You cannot possibly go wrong getting this product.Krups makes a very fine product."
3,Great while it lasts,"I've had this grinder for one year and three months. I use it about 2-3 times per week to grind coffee beans 99% of the time. It can grind to very fine level or a course ground, which i often use with myTravel Press Coffee & Tea Maker - ""Give Up Bad Coffee For Good"" Logo 0.47 l, 16 oz.. I've also used it with peanuts for thai dishes and that worked great as well. Unfortunately, the motor seized the other day. Out of warranty and out of luck. It was my first grinder and was great for the 15 months it lasted."
5,Very Pleased!,"Based upon all the other outstanding and helpful reviews, I chose this grinder for fine coffee grind and for grinding flax seeds into meal. Speedy and thorough - it does the job. I did learn though, not to over-fill with seeds/beans because then it's tricky to remove the lid without dumping the ""grind"". Not the Krup-grinder's fault...just an overly ambitious human. If you prefer a fine grind - here's your grinder!"
4,Krups Spice and Coffee Grinder,"Noisy, but it does work very well for my purposes, and it does get the job done. My other complaint is that it doesn't hold a whole lot."
4,Best grinder,"I have used different coffee grinders in the last 10 years and this is one of the best. It has one of the most powerful motor for such a small body. It is a bit noisy specially in the morning, however it's only a minor issue. Since I only use it to grind the coffee, there is no need to clean it everyday. I love it and in fact I'm very happy with my decision to buy two of them at the same time. I strongly recommend to everyone who wants to have a nice cup of fresh coffee in the morning."
4,Krups coffee grinder,"I use a lot of coffee beans. I like the fresh taste of the coffee from freshly ground beans. This grinder is very compact, the blades are very sharp and it grinds in a few seconds. Krups does a great job, takes up little space in my cupboard!"
5,Really ground-up beans,"I've ground coffee beans in the past, but this thing grinds the hell out of coffee beans; it's like talcum powder."
1,ridiculous design,"This is such a ridiculously-designed grinder. The stainless interior begins an inch down from the rim. It should have been all the way to the rim. It doesn't fit tight against the sides and whatever you grind gets caught in between. You can't wash it properly because you cannot put water inside it (will leak in that same gap and ruin the innards) and you cannot ever wash the bottom side of the blade. The first time I used it to grind aniseeds, the whirling seeds cut into the clear top and permanently scratched the whole thing. Also, don't plan on using it for more than one thing. Now mine smells like anise since I cannot clean it properly. I cannot use it for coffee or anything else. Would not have purchased if I had known better."
4,Grinder,"This is a good grinder, however, I wished it had been made in Germany, instead of China. It grinds very well, but doesn't have the feel that it will hold up long term."
3,messy to use,"I replaced my old Mr. Coffee grinder with this one because I didn't like the way the plastic scraper in Mr. Coffee disintegrated over time, meaning it was winding up inside me. This grinder works well, but it is messy. After grinding coffee, I have to open it over the sink or else I wind up with coffee dust all over the counter. Even then, I have to wipe up every time I use it. If I wasn't so lazy, I would return it and go back to using a Mr. Coffee grinder. At my age, I'm not that worried about ingesting a little plastic."
2,Grind and grind and grind,"The grinder is noisy--do the pot holder thingy to muffle the racket, it helps a little. My animals still take off like the hammers of hell are after them. It also grinds only a small amount, so if you want to grind enough for a few days, you gotta grind and grind. It is also a bear to clean--there's a spot under the latch on the lid that you will never get totally clean, even with soap and water (only the lid is immersible). Price is reasonable though."
4,Difficult to clean,I use this to grind spices and after I grind one I have to clean it up before the next use. You cannot use water and soap. The aroma of one spice lingers after brushing and it messes up with the next spice.Other than that it is an overall good grinder and I love its small size.
4,It Grindz the Bean!,"Basic and functional, that's all you need. Works well and you can't beat the price. Quality appears to be very good for the money. I would recommend you purchase a cleaning brush as well."
4,Great Product,"After receiving this product, I can see why it scored well on ratings. Great size and looks, but what really impressed me was the efficiency of the motor and grinding blades. Two three second bursts and it was done. Cleans up well, though really should have bought a brush for cleaning. A stiff paintbrush would work, but I will shop for one on amazon, right away. Only reason not a five star for me? Not dual voltage."
5,Good grinder,This grinder is fast and relatively quiet. It does a good job producing an even drip grind although one or two beans might be left. I am also able to get a coarse grind for use with my french press by pulsing the on/off switch and limiting the grinding time. A soft bristle brush will keep it clean. I'd buy this one again.
5,great product,"This grinder works really well for spices and flax seeds. I now have one for coffee, one for everything else. Delivery was fast. Thanks"
4,nice style but a little small,"works well, and not too difficult to clean, really quite full if grinding enough for 12 cup coffeemaker at one time"
2,Good execution of a poor design,"I use a french press and so want my beans ground consistently coarse. It is not possible to achieve that with any blade type of coffee grinder. I used this for several years and from a functionality standpoint it is a solid product. It was not until I switched to a burr type coffee grinder that I realized how poor a job this product was grinding beans to a desired level of coarseness. If you are grinding spices or do not really care about a consistent coarseness of your beans, then this product will do a good job. If you want more control, look at a burr type of grinder."
5,So far so good.,"Had it for about a month now, works well, no complaints. Used it only for coffee and sugar powder, not spices. If you use it for spices you probably won't be able to clean it. But yeah, for the money - it's great."
3,Unequal grind,"If you like fine grind for espresso, this coffee grinder will work for you just fine. For any coarser grind you will get a mixture of larger bits, coarse and very fine grind coffee. I am a bit disappointed, but maybe I was just expecting too much.If it is messy, well yes, just as much as any other coffee grinder....no surprise there."
1,Broken!,Worked fine for about a year then it just quit. Is the motor shot? Who knows... I don't have the time or wherewithall to repair coffee grinders. Now I'm back to grinding it at the store--which is fine as long as you refrigerate it and drink it within a week.
1,I didn't think it was disposable,"after reading so many good reviews about this product, i bought it believing that it was a very good purchase !!But it stopped working the second time I used it !! There was nothing to be done to fix it, because it comes assembled in one single piece and it is impossible to check the inside to see what is wrong with it !! Worst purchase ever !!"
1,Piece of Crap,"I was very impressed with the reviews, and bought this. The third time I used it, the blade popped off and will NOT go back on."
2,impossible to clean,"Although this product does grind really week, I hated it because it was impossible to clean. You can't remove the blades or the part where the beans are ground, so you're left trying to wipe out oily coffee bean residue with a wet paper towel -- all the while trying to avoid cutting your fingers on the sharp blades. Don't buy it."
3,Krups touch coffee grinder,"I have owned this coffee grinder for 20 years and it does a fine job of grinding for a drip maker or a press espresso maker. I have also used it for pepper corns, chilies and flax seed. A few years ago the clear lid started breaking up at the bottom and pieces ground up with the coffee. I no longer use it because I do not want plastic in my coffee. Taping the bottom of the lid has helped. I hope that the composition of the lid has been improved in the last 20 years and I am planning to buy a new one to see if it has."
2,It Broke!!,"Most of you gave this grinder 4 stars. However, I used mine just 3 times to grind spices. The blade broke in half with only 1/2 teaspoon on peppercorns in it. I am currently waiting for the manufacturer to send me a new one. I'll let you know how it works the second time around"
1,Blade broke off,"Well is was only $20 but I expected more from Krups. It was very lightly used, maybe ten times over about a year. It has only had coffee in it and Im a very tolerant and careful user. I tried it last week, it made an godawful noise which turned out to be the blade impacting the metal lining. It had seemingly worn through the lining. The blade then broke off on the second attempt. Hard to clean anyway as the blade it not removable, so its an excuse to buy another. Wont buy Krups anything again though. At $2 a grind I may as well go to Starbucks. Complete crap."
5,It does what I need it to do.,It was packaged well and it works. That is all I expect from any product. This fits the bill! Krups makes good products!
4,Works as advertised,"We have had several coffee grinders over the years (all have broken down over a year or so of use). So far this grinder works as advertised, was very inexpensive, and hopefully it won't break! The only reservation is it's a little awkward to pour out the ground coffee - since you have to use the whole grinder to pour it out. So far so good."
4,grinds great!,"Works very well, the only problem I am having is after grinding spices it's hard get the smell out before grinding the next item. While you can wash the top in soapy water, the grinding area is to be wiped out, only with a damp cloth. So as you can imagine after grinding some Cloves for my Easter Ham I had some reservations about grinding coffee beans untill I could get the cloves oil and smell out."
5,Good product,"I was very pleased with this item. I love fresh ground coffee, and I like it ground fine and this coffee grinder did it just right and you cannot beat it for the price!!"
3,cracks in lid,This is my second Krups grinder and I do like them. I had my old one for 10 years. But this latest one has developed cracks in the lid and I have only used it since January 2011. They are inside the plastic and are working their way across the top like stress fractures - they have not actually cracked the lid. But I was so surprised to see this. I have only used it for coffee and occasionally for cardamom seed and I do not over grind them. It makes me wonder how long this one will last.
4,Good grinder,"I bought this coffee grinder to use mainly as a spice grinder. It works well for all the spices I've put in it so far. My only complaint is that it is not easy to clean out. I don't want black pepper in my cookie spices, but it takes a lot of effort to clean around the blade. Also, I'm afraid to actually wash out the bowl part for fear I accidentally get water into the motor compartment, so I have only wiped it out with a damp cloth.Overall, it works really well, especially if you don't need to clean it out to avoid flavor contamination."
5,"Its ok for home use, not for a barista, but the price is right","Its not perfect, but its a good home grinder for the price. A barista or coffee purist would want something more involved, this involves user input to determine the coarseness of the grind, rather than setting the machine to make that decision. But, when I bought my daughter a Little Amps Coffee subscription for her birthday, and she needed the grinder to use the whole beans they provide, I did some research and this still was the best bet. We have one for our office too. Gets the job done, a pot at a time."
5,Very Satisfied,"Received this product a couple of months ago. I have never owned a coffee grinder before so I really don't have anything to compare it to, but I have been very pleased with this product. It's very easy to use and it does what it's supposed to - grinds coffee and grinds it as fine as you want. I highly recommend this product."
3,French Press Yes -- Espresso No,"This little machine is reliable and gives a nice coarse to medium grind which suits the french press. However, read the owner's manual -- you'll see one sentence in small print that the manufacturer does NOT recommend it for making espresso grind. Amazon would do well to be sure that Krups 203-42 does not appear among grinders suitable for espresso. Burr grinders."
3,Does what it is supposed to do,"What can I say? It grinds coffee. So it is as advertised, but nothing special. I like the quality of the grind. Still, one must dig out the coffe like any standard grinder."
4,Perfect for coffee bean enthusiasts,"I bought this so I could start buying whole beans to grind as needed each morning for coffee. It works great, and is very compact so it does not take up a lot of counter space. Perfect for small apartment kitchens.I have since gotten too lazy, and haven't used it as much, but for more die-hard coffee bean over coffee grounds enthusiasts, it's great for the price."
5,"Good, reliable, reasonably priced.","Not much to say, except that it's always there when you need it. I bought it to replace a piece of garbage burr grinder that I threw out the window. Don't believe the Burr-Grinding-Nazis, this machine does the job better. Take a few moments and learn how to use it, and you'll have years of reliable service. Works great for my pump-driven espresso machine, I just take a pinch and feel its coarseness. A few minutes of self training will save you a lot of money and chagrin a burr grinder can cause.I had other similar grinders in the past, coffee grounds jammed the safety feature, not so with this one. Well designed and built to last. Easy to clean and affordable."
4,My little grinder,"Grinder works well. Not the best design as there is no place to store/wrap the cord around the base when not being used, and it doesn't come with a small cleaning brush like my previous 2 grinders. Otherwise, no complaints."
1,Disappointed!,This worked one time for my coffee grounds. Then it quit working! I had to send it back!I guess I was expecting more out of this little machine.
5,Nice and easy,"We have two of these grinders. For awhile we tried a burr type grinder from B&D. This is much faster, easier to clean, and smaller. I recommend this grinder."
1,Absolutely worthless,You have to turn this product upside down to load beans and get the top off. This is very difficult and you have to unplug it to accomplish this. It grinds the coffee quite well but then when trying to get to the ground coffee you again have to unplug it and turn it upside down to pry off the top and ground coffee spills all over the counter - EVERYTIME!
5,Gets the job done,This unit get the job done efficiently and consistently. I was a bit concerned during my purchase because of the small package and low price. Those concerns disappeared once I began to use this maxhine. Very nice!
5,You can't mess up,"Nice little grinder that does a good job and holds enough to make six cups. And a plus, is designed to allow you to pour the ground coffee easily into the brewer. A good buy."
4,Brett,This product grinds coffee beans however fine I want them. It works great and is more quiet than other brands I have used.
4,My First Coffee Grinder !,"This is my first coffee grinder and I am quite pleased with it. The quality of the product is above average. It looks very nice and the blades are quite sharp. It does not hold a large quantity of beans, but that is ok with me as I am the only one drinking coffee at my house. One other slight problem is the lid. You have to learn to remove it very slowly and carefully or the grinds fly out everywhere. Once I learned to watch for this (and put a paper towel under the grinder), everything worked great. I recommend this grinder. A nice little unit for the price. What I would expect from the KRUPS brand."
4,pretty good,"This is a great grinder when I use it with paper filters. It is fairly quiet so it doesn't wake my husband up in the morning as he is a very light sleeper. It provides a fast grind and I almost never burn the beans.The only thing I don't like is that there is no speed control and sometimes it's a bit hard to clean out because you have to sweep it all the time because the coffee powder builds up at the bottom often. Besides that, it makes delicious coffee!"
3,Gets the job done-smelly and hard to clean though,"My first coffee grinder so I'm just getting used to its quirks. Wasn't anticipating the smell of burning rubber each time. Am I doing something wrong? A little disconcerting. Also, cleaning is a pain, thankfully I have small fingers but even still you don't really get all the little grounds out."
5,Krups fast touch - ROCKS! Works better than described!,I got this for my flax seeds which I was trying to do in my coffee bean grinder with NO success - I opened the Krups threw some seeds in and WOW almost INSTANTLY it did the job! I could not be happier! So convenient too!
4,Essential for the PRR modeler or anyone with a Pennsy interest.,"This book is exactly what the title says: it describes the PRR's principal trains, their consists, and the passenger cars that comprised them during 1952 and to a lesser extent previous or subsequent years.This period is a very interesting one for modelers since it was just before the precipitous decline in the Pennsy's passenger services, just after the widespread dieselization of PRR passenger service, but just before the end of steam operations.It's illustrated with photographs of the cars used, either from the same timeframe or later. Most of the pictures appear to be new; I don't recognise them from previous works."
5,"Clear Sound,","I do not knew that Mendelsshon is very good sound for me.Sir Roger Norrington,Thank you,Shimphonise4,first Chapter make lirux feeling in mine. And Happiness.Thanks,"
1,"leaks goo, too",I see that several people have the same problem I do. After only 4 or 5 uses the base/bowl that goes in the freezer has sprung a leak. The leak is not at a seal but rather in the middle of the metal as if the goo has eaten through it. I would highly discourage anyone from purchasing this product.
3,Krups Ice Cream Maker,"It really works. I pour in all the ingredients and it does the job. The ice cream is soft, and takes a couple of hours to freeze. Not bad.Easy to clean. Just put the bucket back in the freezer, but you do need some freezer space to have it ready for anytime ice cream."
3,Makes good ice cream but it's not the easist to use,"The Krups ice cream maker makes good ice cream, and the recipes that come in the manual are decent. However, it is fairly complex to use, requires preparation several hours or a day before you want the ice cream, often requires cooking the mixture in a pan, and the reciples in the manual are difficult to understand (it doesn't specify temperatures and stuff like that).But, the ice cream you make should turn out well. And a whole family could get involved with making the ice cream. Plus, the machine is affordable. Overall, it's a good product."
2,Cheezy!,"This item is difficult to assemble for use and does not hold up well over time. The paddle assembly is very flimsy and broke soon after the freezer was purchased. More recently, some type of warpage has occurred in the unit which makes it impossible to install the top assembly (which was difficult when new). We do not recommend this freezer unit."
3,Not as durable as I hoped,"I made ice cream often using crushed ice and rock salt. This is much more convenient. I have been able to start after setting the bowl in the freezer for 12 hours. I broke the paddle after trying to get a sample out of the maker with a spoon. Fortunately, I was able to get a replacement from Krups. I have been careful to wash and dry the bowl completely after each use. I think, water gets in between the plastic outer and metal inner bowl. It freezes and cracks the inner bowl. It is a bad design flaw. Now I am getting the freezing liquid stuff all over the place. I am in the market for a new one after three years of use."
1,leaks goo,I used this about 4 times before the (toxic?) gel inside started leaking out into the mixing tub. I would not purchase this product.
2,"Good ice cream, flimsy parts","I bought this because it came very highly rated in a magazine.I've had it about a year and rarely used it because I have a small, very packed apt freezer and I really had to plan to freeze the bowl. The ice cream was good when I got around to making it but the reason I'm writing my first ever amazon review tonight is that I want to warn you the parts are iffy. First the paddle snapped - it was still usable, but broken. Then the top broke in the dishwasher. And as I was cleaning the base, I just noticed goopy liquid leaking out of the seal around the base. And I'm not banging the stuff around I swear! Quite disappointed really."
2,Good ice cream but badly designed,"The ice cream this machine makes is just fine, very good in fact as everyone has said. However, I agree with other reviewers that it is poorly designed. I have been using this machine for 1 1/2 years, approximately once a week. It has always been very loud, so much so that I have to put it in a cabinet to muffle the noise. (My husband hates it.) The other thing is the lid. It worked fine at first but it's been at least a year since it worked properly. It just doesn't fit properly, and I run the risk of it popping off when I'm making ice cream which would ruin the ice cream. I love ice cream, and it occurs to me that I shouldn't have to deal with these trials and tribulations everytime I make it. So I'm thinking of getting the Cuisinart although I'd like to know more about how it holds up over time."
1,Worst ice cream maker ever!!,"I owned mine for about 1 1/2 years before I just had to put in into the trash!! Krups customer service wasn't helpful, ever and both the lid and canister broke at the same time!! ..."
5,Top-notch!,"The La Glaciere Ice Cream Maker is easy to use, and makes delicious, smooth ice cream at an unbelievably speedy rate. It's easy to put together and good-looking. I'm very happy I bought it--it's made gallons and gallons of terrific ice cream and undoubtedly will make many more!"
2,"poor design, warped canister","The way this ice cream maker is put together, you must balance the dasher carefully in the vat of ice cream mixture and work quickly to attach it to the lid and motor before the mixture freezes so hard that the dasher can't turn. The contraption is tricky to put together so make sure you do a few trial runs first. The worst part, though, is that the canister became warped after a few uses, making it nearly impossible to fit all the parts together. The only redeeming part: I've never had trouble with the canister not freezing enough, but I suspect that's more to do with freezer temperature. I love not having to mess with ice and salt, but I recommend you choose a different brand."
4,"loved it, until it leaked",I used my machine for several years on and off and loved the results. Sadly the cooling gel ended up leaking out and seemed to burn a hole through the aluminium lining. Suffice to say it no longer seemed safe to use. I now have a motor and paddles and no bowl...
2,Gel leaked out after 3 years,"Like many other reviews, the gel leaked out after 3 years, making the freezing bowl useless. And the replacement bowl costs almost as much as the whole unit."
3,Loved it until the bowl leaked,"I loved this ice cream maker. It was so convenient to keep the bowl in the freezer and make the ice cream whenever I wanted it. I used it 20 or 30 times. After my last use, I cleaned and dried the bowl as always, but didn't have the room in the freezer at the time. I put the bowl in my cabinet. Several months later I got the bowl out to put it in the freezer and the bottom was filled with the gel from inside the bowl's wall. I noticed a small pin hole in the bowl near the bottom. I thought it was a fluke and was ready to buy a replacement bowl, but read all the online reviews of people having similar problems with the bowls. Now I think I'll just look at another maker instead."
2,Gel Leaks,Same problem here. The bowl breaks itself and the gel leaks out. Can't use it anymore. Going to call Krups and see what they are going to say about this.
5,your friends will love you,"Making ice cream couldn't be easier than with this sturdy dependable machine...once you start making your own ice cream , not a summer weekend will go by without it. And your friends that you invite over to share it? They'll think you're the best thing since Ben & Jerry...guaranteed. You'll love this machine. Tip for hot sticky summer days=put the whole machine right in the freezer will it's running to cut on extra time. Do yourself a favor and buy the Ultimate Ice Cream Book and the Ben& Jerry's Ice Cream Book for lots of fun recipes!"
2,Look around before buying...,"I bought this product thinking it looked like a sturdy product at first glance. However, this product was engineered poorly and is easy to break. I returned it and got the Cuisinart equivalent and have had no problems since (12 months later anyway). If possible, compare both products in a store before purchasing.The Cuisinart has done a good job for me though..."
1,"mediocre product, even worse service","Under the best of circumstances the product doesn't produce ice cream. It also appears to have shoddy parts. Though the customer service people are polite, they have no ability to deliver real service. I've been waiting 5+ months for a replacement paddle, with no end in sight. And no one on the other end of the phone has a good answer for when -- or if -- the part will ever arrive."
2,Not as good as it sounds...,"My boyfriend received one of these for his birthday this year, and, like so many others, we've been disappointed. Unless you use the recipes provided, and unless your base is VERY cold, the ice cream will not become thick enough to hold on a spoon. Other reviwers are correct in that it's quite loud, and that the lid is poorly designed. But overall the worst part is that we can't have the ice cream we were so excited about. I'm hoping for better luck with another line..."
1,"Beware, beware!","The frustrations others have expressed about this product are (sadly) true. I really cannot say anything positive about the Krups ice cream maker. It's too bad, because the first few times I used it, my ice cream turned out great. But little by little it became harder to use, until now the top attachment is impossible to fit onto the bowl, the motor is extremely loud and makes awful grinding noises when it runs, and sounds as though there are multiple parts loose inside... all this despite taking very good care of all the parts. I assume at least some of these problems have to do with the bowl expanding or warping as it gets cold... but that aside, the motor is clearly shoddy too. With a lot of patience it is possible to get it working even now, but I'm still ready to chuck the whole thing. I haven't use the Cuisinart model, but I have to hope it works better than this one..."
2,"Buy something, ANY thing, else if you want to make ice cream immediately","We received this ice cream maker for our marriage four years ago. I didn't use it until just a few days ago. When I opened and read the instructions, I discovered that I would have to put the bowl in the freezer for at least 8 hours, and that's only if my freezer is set low enough to freeze the teats off of a polar bear; otherwise, it can take up to 24 hours to completely prepare the bowl.I have used it maybe seven times. The last two times, the machine HAS NOT worked. So, the ice cream fixings I made will end up in the freezer not completely made into ice cream.Although it claims to make 1.5 quarts, the instructions tell you to put only enough in for 1 quart.Buy something else."
3,"I was going to buy this ice cream maker,","because it came highly recommended on one of those morning shows. However, after examining it at the kitchen store and reading up on it (especially others rating it), I decided to pass. I guess I'll stick with my old tried and true Breyers!Thanks for the other customer reviews."
1,Broken after 2 use,"The bowl started to leak fluids after only 2 use. I carefully hand washed the bowl with a soft sponge after each use. It made great ice cream and sorbet, but is now unusable. This has happened to at least 2 others (there's one review here, one at e-pinion). I'm having trouble finding Krups customer service, so I think I'm going to throw it away go with another company."
4,I love this thing,"We got this ice cream maker a few weeks ago and have not progressed past the vanilla stage. I love the fact that I can make soft serve ice cream at home. We had the Rival ice cream maker (ya know the one where you use ice and rock salt) and it never really worked well for us. This one is a breeze. It is a bit noisy, but no more than my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. with the dishwasher on you cant hear it at all! I can only give 4 stars though. The top design could have been better. It is difficult to pour the mixture into the machine through the small opening at the top. All in all a good machine for home use. I will say that if you plan to use it a lot (like every week or so) I would invest in a commercial model. At ($) I would expect to replace it in a couple of years."
4,Works great but noisy,"I have made dozens batches in mine and I love it. Here's my reactions to the criticism I've seen here. It is noisy; I don't know how other models compare but they could well be quieter. The lid is hard to snap on but after a few tries it's not that bad. But the complaints about soft ice cream seem unfair. All home ice cream makers (ones without their own cooling power) will make soft ice cream. It's still good, but ideally I make it 2-4 hours before serving and it firms up just enough. You have to freeze the machine for a long time before using it, and the people who say that didn't help should check their freezer's temperature with a thermometer rather than just saying that they had their freezer on the lowest setting. Finally, I recommend ""How to Make Ice Cream"" by the editors of Cook's Illustrated for the authoritative guide to ice cream making. The recipes aren't exotic, but once you have the basics down, it's easy to modify these recipes."
2,Great .... when it works,"We loved this ice cream maker -- the ease of use, delicious results and quick cleanup were terrific. The only drawback was the unnecessarily difficult lid. However, after three months of occasional use we found that the paddle no longer will fit into the machine, so the lid won't lock down. We either have to stand there holding the lid down ourselves, or replace the machine. It has been difficult ... no, impossible ... to get support from Krups. We will try a Cuisinart machine next time."
2,"Great in Concept, Not So Great in Use","Once I was able to get all of the parts to fit properly and the lid to lock in place, this machine made great ice cream. However, getting the equipment to work correctly was an exercise in futility.First of all, the instructions don't explain that you MUST have the blade in place before adding the ice cream mixture, else it will freeze right to the bowl, making it impossible for the blade to fit or turn. Once you make it past this hurdle, you move on to the challenge of putting the lid in place (there was a great deal of swearing in my kitchen the day of this machine's first use). On about my fourth use of the Krups machine, the blade cracked, which makes the process even more laborious. When I attempted to use the machine about a month ago, I found that I couldn't fit the lid in place at ALL, rendering the machine completely useless.I would have a hard time recommending this product to anyone. I'm going to give the Cuisinart model a try next time."
1,Hinge Pin Brakes Easily,This grill broke on the first time we used it. The culprit is a very weak hunge that is molded in the grill so that it cannot be repaired easily. Using the grill once the hinge is broken is hazardous; the grill gets very hot and the top flops around. I don't recommend it to anyone even at the drastically reduced price.
5,Hamilton Beach Grill,"We love it. Husband grills outdoors all the time. We travel in a motor home and when the rains come, we found it impossible to go outside to to cook. SO! We bought this grill and use it constantly. Food tastes as good as any cooked outside. Don't know why we waited so long to buy. The food, steaks, chicken, pork chops and vegetables all came out perfect."
4,Needs removable grills,"I like the grill a lot. A temperature control would have been nice, and removable cooking grids would make clean up a lot easier."
5,An excellent book for applied researchers in SEM,"This is an excellent reference book for applied researchers who use advanced structural equation modeling (SEM) in social, psychological, and biomedical studies. The authors are well-known experienced experts in SEM, and the contents of this book are practical. Researcher who use different software in SEM can find their practical examples and related theoretical bases."
2,Slightly better than Perpetual Yawn,"With no disrespect to those who wrote positive reviews, I find this release only slightly better than ""All This Everything"" [...] But hey, at least I enjoyed Teakwood Betz off of this release!"
3,Pas mal...,"I only really liked ""Tonton du bled"" and even then only just. Its certainly a good album but not, for me, an essential one."
5,Brighton Park Memoirs,I've been listening to this album for years and it never gets old to me. It's one of the most beautiful things out there and these guys should all give themselves a pat on the back for creating something so wonderful...and get back together to make more music.
2,Bad design,"I just purchased this knife to slice up a rump roast. My hands are not small, but trying to get a grip on the handle and push down on the on button is difficulty. I had to stop and rest my hand once in awhile. Also the motor got very hot. Will look for something else."
3,heavy knife,This knife looks good but I find it too heavy for normal usage. The blade is very difficult to remove too.
1,Junk,"Bought this one at a local store because we had two choices: cheap or cheaper. This was the more ""expensive"" of the two. Blade is sharp but motor is weak; doesn't slice whole wheat bread very well at all. Handle is uncomfortable to hold. I won't even bother to try it for carving turkey. Miss my old electric knife that lasted for nearly 15 years!"
2,short lived,"Worked great for six months, then the motor started burning up and I could smell it very strongly. We only use it for slicing bread and I expected it to last much longer."
1,Not good design,"The design features for the on/off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things. Otherwise, the on/off switch is not good at all. The button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position. You actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going. The blade was sharp for the one and only time I used it. I took it back right after Thanksgiving."
1,A Piece of Junk,"This knife is nothing but a piece of garbage. The button which activates the knife won't remain pressed easily. The duel blade aren't aligned well, so whatever your slicing gets caught between the blades. The knife gets very hot, and I imagine it will stop working soon, even though I just bought it, also it is quite a bit heavier than my old electric knife. This knife is truely a waste of money, no matter how cheap it is."
1,Worse than Useless,"This knife is actually worse than useless. The design is dangerous. The blade release button is on the top of the mechanism near the top of handle (area close to the blades) while the on switch is on the bottom of the device, directly underneath the blade release button. It's very easy to grip both at the same time.In addition, this knife lacks either power or sharp blades (can't really tell which). I've tried to use it to cut bread. The blades just dance around on the crust of the bread, imperiling my fingers. It doesn't even make it completely through the crust. I have to follow up with my serrated knife.Horrible product. Don't purchase."
2,Too hot to handle!!,"The blades are nice and sharp, but this knife weighs a ton - not good, since you have to hold down the ""on"" switch the whole time. But worse than that was the overheating. The unit got HOT after slicing up only half a loaf of biscotti. If it can't take that, how on earth would it make it through a whole turkey?!Next time I'll lay out more cash for a knife that can actually handle a little work."
1,Proctor Silex easy slice electric knife # 74311,"This knife is too large and too heavy for my hands, it hurts my wrist to use it. I don't like it at all. I'll throw it away as soon as I find a smaller one that fits my feminine hand. I avoid using it. A reminder to the manufacturers, it is not only big fisted men that use a knife. I avoid using it whenever possible. Does anyone know of a small electric knife that fits a small hand?"
2,Replacement,"I purchased this electric knife to replace a 30 year old Hamilton Beach knife that stopped working. I have found this knife difficult to use. The handle is to large and bulky to hold onto easly and the on/off switch is in a bad location on the bottom, making the hard to keep running and guide at the same time to cut nice even slices. I cannot get the same quality of slice thickness with this knife I could with my old Hamilton Beach. My old knife had the on/off switch on the top under my index finger which made running and guiding the knife at the same time much easy. It gets the job done but is not an easy applience to use. I will continue to shop for one that is more like the one I had. I will never understand the reason for redesigning a product that worked great. They only made a worse product not a better one. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."""
5,Good buy. Great Value,I like this knife. It is not to big or to small. Great price and a good value. Would recommend
2,Too Hard for Me....,I have seen and listened to most all of Beamer's instruction and all of it seems way to difficult for me. I am a pretty good learner but it always seems like his teaching takes a lot for granted. Just my two cents.
1,Awful,"I've never been motivated to write an online review before this, but the terrible plotting, non-existent characterization and inane action sequences of this book pushed me to it. This book is one of a select few that I actually didn't bother finishing. It shares this 'honour' with Battleship Earth, if that gives you any idea of the awfulness.Don't buy this book. Don't encourage David Dunn to write a sequel or anything this bad again.Mike Barnard"
1,The Black Silent,"OK: I admit it, I like suspense and thriller novels. If I am going to read fiction, it is worthwhile to invest my time in something not only heart-stopping but within the realm of credulity. Sadly, this is not the case for David Dun's novel The Black Silent. Though touted as a rival to Michael Crichton, he is not in that league.I am a sophisticated reader, holding a PhD in English Literature and having taught in that discipline. With that admission, I found the novel confusing and poorly plotted. It is from cover to cover one extended chase scene involving for the most part poorly developed characters. It became tiresome.I was expecting more. I got much less. My judgement: take a pass."
4,A tight thriller,"By about page 20 or so you know that there is going to be a major confrontation between Garth Frick and Sam Wintripp. These two don't like each other and through out the book we witness Frick steadily lose control and Wintripp decide to do something very violent in response.THE BLACK SILENT starts out with the bad guys holding all the cards and the good guys playing catch up.There are plenty of action sequences, daring escapes and the steady revelation as to why Frick is so desperate.There is a good balance between action and intrigue, and it is this balance that keeps you turning pages."
4,"Rich, suspenseful, knuckle biting","Dunn catches the reader off guard and pushes them into a pool filled with harrowing obstacles, near escapes, exciting chases, and witty characters. Dialogue is intelligent and believeable, each character serves a purpose, the mystery is thick enough to be plausible, suspense is present in each chapter. The pace is swift and deadly, and the mission/goal of the characters clear and easily sympathized with. The plight is believable and not dopey, while the ending wraps up the entire battle quite expertly. If this book does have flaws, it's that the character of Sam is a bit unbelievable in his abilities to overcome so much, and that the villain is a bit 'too bad'. Overall though, a great read, highly recommended, and a must for suspense fans."
2,Tedious and Tiresome,"What a job it was to read this tale of endless chases. I finally skipped 200 pages, read the last chapter and the Epilogue. The good guys got sorted out from the bad guys and they all survived to live happily ever after, ready for the next chase."
4,English class,Needed this dandy thing for English class. It was a little out of day but hey under a dollar it was sufficient.
3,The Brief Wadsworth Handbook,"I though this was a little confusing to follow. It gave you the information you were looking for, but you had to research a lot of chapters before you could be sure the info was what you wanted."
1,don't buy it!,"Although the coffee tastes wonderful, this coffeemaker is a shame for this company to sell! The carafe drips no matter how you pour it! What's worse, is that the company will not admit their fault... They wanted me to send the carafe in for a replacement -- NO thanks, I don't want another problem like this again!"
3,Fire danger!!,"Makes a great pot of coffee, but beware!! For just pennies, they could have installed an automatic turn off function...this model doesnt have it! If you leave after that last pot and forget to turn it off...it doenst turn itself off."
4,Great Buy!,"If you only drink a couple of mugs at a time, then this is the machine for you.The coned filter allows me to use less grinds per cup to get the same strength coffee I would get out of my old flat filtered 12-cup machine; and I don't have to pour out a 1/4 pot of burned coffee. This machine will pay for itself in a few months.The pot only drips if you pour way too fast. I personally have no problems with it whatsoever; I have no idea what other reviewers are complaining about."
5,The best evaluation survey text,"This text surveys evaluation theory and practice in a manner that is easy to understand and teach. It's appropriate for undergraduate or graduate work in performance evaluation. The authors do an excellent job of reviewing the history and key literature. They also briefly explain popular methodologies and discuss different approaches, such as objective and holistic. The book includes case study material that highlights processes, advantages, drawbacks, and potential problems of evaluation efforts. The authors avoid consulting hype and focus on building the evaluation body of knowledge. An update with Fitzpatrick listed as the first author is now available and also is excellent."
1,Worst text book I have ever read,"I am a masters student in ed leadership and in all my years of schooling, this is the worst book I have ever read. It is boring dry and repeats the same trite issues about accountability that everyone already knows. It is redundant and doesn't challenge the reader at all. This is the first time I have reviewed a product because I am so disatisfied."
4,Much better than live turkey,"Although wearing a live turkey on your head for the holidays can be difficult, I was brought up in a very traditional family where there was never any question that it would be alive and gobbling or don't bother. But after years of problems and mis-haps I thought it might be time to at least consider the possibility of wearing a synthetic turkey. We explored many options and found most to be very expensive or unnecessarily complicated -- genetic cloning brought the picketers, the robotics went on the fritz whenever the DVR was set to record, and wax caused second degree facial burns when I wore it near the candelabra. I was delighted to find this device at a low price. It is snug, lightweight and comfortable. It does not fall off easily, nor does it peck at your face and shoulders at loud noises, bright lights, or when it rains."
3,Super itchy and uncomfortable.,"It's too itchy to keep on long, but it's a turkey hat. It has glittery tinsel all over it which is fine, except it shouldn't be INSIDE the overly tight headband"
4,A little small for my big head.,Nicely made product. Only complaint is that it is made for an average size head with no way to make it bigger. My hat size is about a 7 1/2 and it's tight.
1,Not as described,"This is not a ""dozen"" pitchers as described. In fact the dozen doesn't describe anything about it, not the size or anything. This is one pitcher, that's it. I'm returning it."
5,Great Product - Great Price,I purchased a set of lids for my new 10 piece set of Henkel cookware. The product is superb and Amazon ordering and shipping was not only quick but efficient. I will trade with Amazon again.
2,A garden of Sound,"This book does a wonderful job of explaining the principles behind sound waves. The launguage is easy to understand, and the pages not darkened by excessive mathmatics. If you are looking for the best classical music acoustic design book out there, you have found it.However. C. Brooks seems to beilieve that the only people that care about acoustics are classical music fanatics. From the offset he talks about his love for clasical music and hearing a single note fade away to silence. I didn't buy the book for classical music, I bought it to enhance my rock and roll experince. The book is centered towards classical music and the acoustics there in, but I did glean a few gems from the pages, allowing me to better the acoustics in my room, but those were few and far between.Classical music fans, rejoice! Rock and roll fans, keep your hands away. I'm sure there's a book for you somewhere out there."
2,An architect looking for practical information...,"With prudent editing, this rambling, discourse of music and architectural aesthetic psuedo-philosophy could be reduced to a thick pamphlet about architectural acoustics."
1,Ugh,"Number Uno, I live in Bellows Falls and Mr Archer Mayor lives in Putney. So he doesn't know the first thing about what it's even _like_ to live here! The book only focused on the bad things of BF, not the good things. It made us all seem like a bunch of debauched hick drug addicts. Get a life! Not only has everyone in the state now heard of us, but the whole country! I'd rather be from Westminster any day."
2,Well-researched but far from compelling.,"Usually, I breeze through books like this. I read WiseGuys in one sitting. I had to resolve myself to finish this. I think it's less the author's fault and more the fault of his subjects. These guys are boring. Their crimes are quotidian. There is no Lufthansa heist here. I'd recommend only if you have an insatiable curiousity about the mob in Philly."
2,Boring,"Previte sounds like a loud mouth braggert to me. He is one of those guys who talks like hes done it all but sounds like a phony. The FBI are not as dumb as Previte says they are. I doubt he recieved all the money he says the government gave him. The other characters in the book are dull, immature. If you want to read about the mob try a book about Chicago or NY."
3,not what I expected,this book was not what i had expected it to be. It was shorter then I thought (I read the whole book in 20 minutes).
1,Not good for 8 year old,"This book is alright. My son loves all sorts of ghost stories, ghost hunters, and scary movies. This book did not hold his attention, and he didn't care for it at all. Maybe for older kids."
3,I don't Know,I don't know cause i bought for a gift and they haven't told me if they liked it yet. When they are done i plain on reading it and will give more on this book.
2,"Wonderful wafles, horrible design","I bought this waffle maker a few years ago. Now, I have to say...it works like a dream. I did not have the problem with the handle getting hot. My problem is the cleanup. It is a NIGHTMARE to clean. Even though it is non-stick, it seems to get entirely too greasy to wipe off. I had to let is almost soak...then use the spray in the kitchen sink at odd angles as to not get the inside where the wires are wet somehow.I would not recommend that you buy this product, if you are at all concerned about getting it clean after each use. I absolutely loved the waffles that it produced, but it was not worth the cleanup."
1,Extremely poor heating,"This is my second Krups waffle maker in 10 years. The first one worked well and lasted for 9 years without a problem so I bought the exact waffle maker to replace it. This one is horrible. The heating is very uneven so that the waffle is brown in spots and white in spots when it's finished baking. If I let it bake anymore (which I've tried, just to even out the browning) I end up with a burned waffle.I wouldn't recommend this Krups waffle maker to anyone. Obviously it's not the same one I purchased 10 years ago."
5,A family tradition can continue!,"I received this waffle maker from my late father in law as a Christmas present. Soon it became a family tradition to make Belgian waffles for special brunches, especially with strawberries and whipped cream. We even brought it in the RV when we went camping. Imagine my dismay when the heating element broke down after 13 years of use. It was a joy to find it here on Amazon so I can continue the tradition. About the hot handle issues: I always used the plastic clip to raise and lower the lid, and I used a plastic spatula to pry the waffles free. If I cleaned it up right away there wasn't any problem keeping it clean. It stores easily and heats up quickly. The waffle recipe in the directions is delicious. I can't wait until my new one arrives!"
3,Just Ok,"I've had this waffle maker for more than a year now. While it makes nice waffles there are two major issues with the design. One - the plates are really hard to clean (it would have been nice if you could remove the plates and stick them in the dishwasher). Two - you have to be careful with how much batter you pour since whoever designed this thing clearly have not though about how to deal with overflow. If I put too much batter in it starts flowing from the sides, sometimes from the backside and makes a big mess... I had no issues with waffles sticking to the plates. Overall, if were to buy another waffle maker I would look for something easier to clean and a unit that can deal with overflow."
3,"great waffles, hard to clean","This machine makes fabulous waffles, especially compared with our vintage 1960's waffle maker. However it is difficult to clean, as the grids don't come out, and there are small grooves along the sides for batter to get trapped in. If you can deal with that then go for it."
4,When your plates get stuck,I used crepe batter this morning and someone forgot to grease the plates so they got stuck together GOOD. After it cooled I couldn't pry them apart by hand. And I couldn't find any reviews on how to undo them without damaging the plates.It worked for me to soak the plates in soapy water and later pry gently wih a butter knife where the batter is visible from the outside. Careful not to scratch the nonstick off the plates.Otherwise a great waffle maker. Love the plate designs!
2,Make sure you spray with cooking spray or you won't get it open!,"I had a cheap waffle make before and this one it worse than cheap! Not only is it hot on the handle, but it burns everything! Yes, the waffles come out nice and thick. MAKE SURE YOU SPRAY BOTH SIDES OF THE WAFFLE MAKER - OR IT WILL STICK SHUT AND YOU WILL REALLY HAVE A MESS LIKE I DID!"
1,AVOID THIS WASTE OF MONEY,"I purchased this waffle iron at Linens N Things last month. ""All sales final"" DUMB move. The plastic clasp broke day 1. And the whole thing fell apart the second time I used it. Do not order this poor excuse of an appliance."
3,good with bad,"Delicious waffles, 4 at a time, handle is hot, hard to know when waffles are ready, hard to clean"
4,Delicious waffle maker!,Love my new belgian waffle maker. Did not have any of the problems that all the other reviewers have complained about. Mine works perfectly fine and I have had guests invite themselves over for the delicious waffles this machine makes. Totally worth it!
2,Way too hard to clean !!!,I'm sooo tempted to send my 4 year old version back to Krups so they can see what an absolute nightmare this is to clean. After four years of use - mine still cooks great but can't now and never could find the right process to clear out the residual gunk on and around every nook on the grid. Mine's going in the trash. I bought a Cuisinart with little heart shaped waffles and I'll have to stick with the Valentine look for awhile. The Cuisinart is at least cleanable.
2,over cooked,I found that if you use the ready light to judge when the waffles are done the first two of the four will be a little dark (burnt).
2,Good waffles while it lasted but poor quality,"We used this waffle maker for less than 2 years on a regular basis (3 times / month) until it suddenly stopped working.It made good waffles and was reasonably easy to clean. However we didn't like the very confusing red/green LED system used to indicate whether the waffle maker was hot enough to make waffles. Also, it suddenly stopped working even though we had taken very good care of it. The short life of the waffle maker is far below what we would expect from a quality oriented company. We wouldn't recommend this appliance."
2,Difficult to clean,"This Krups iron is difficult to clean due to the locations of the hinges and the lack of a drip edge. However it does cook evenly, which is difficult to find in a square or rectangular waffle iron."
3,Do you want a great Waffle Maker?,"We tried several waffle makers. That includes the professional Wells brand you see in restaurants. If you want a great waffle maker then go to Williams-Sonoma and get the Kitchen Aid Professional one. First, there are no cleanup issues at all. I mean zero. Second, it makes two at once which means eveyone eats hot waffles straight from the waffler. Third, it cooks 'em perfect every time. The only possible negative is the cost at around $350. Yikes. However, if you buy from Wiliams-Sonoma you get their customer service and that means you can return nearly forever if it has a problem. We recently returned a kettle two years later with no questions asked. We also use the Classique Fare Beligian Waffle Mix another reviewer metioned. We tried about 20 different mixes."
1,the real Belgian waffle maker--Krups,"Our original Krups waffle maker gave-up after many years use. Unable to find another we purchased other waffle makers claiming to be Belgian waffle makers. They were not, even the Cuisinart was not a real Belgian waffle maker although claimed such. Finally Amazon provided the TrueBelgian waffle maker...a Krups! We are a happy pair once again."
3,Expecting great waffles...and disappointed,"The product information pamphlet says to grease as necessary...what it should say is GREASE EVERY TIME! Otherwise, as the other review states, you will be cleaning for a very long time using a toothpick.Handle gets hot.There's no recommendation for how much batter to fill it with.Uneven cooking.Overall disappointing."
4,The Machine,"Wow, fun reading the reviews. People, get real. Add too much mix, it WILL spill over.. Don't add enough oil in the mix, the waffles won't be your friend.Best waffles ever with wheat free waffle mix. Use olive oil to add a gourmet crispness and flavor, and a banana for a little depth, tequila for a little spice, or almond extract. An extra egg helps too.Have had mine for three years and am getting a back up. Best gift the chick ever gave me..."
2,It just stopped working...,"I have had this waffle maker for a little less than two years. My son has a serious egg allergy, so I bought this so we could all still enjoy waffles with an egg-free recipe. I have used this 2-3 times per month, making large batches at a time to freeze. When eating them fresh, I personally didn't think the waffles got crispy enough in the maker, so I always had to toast them after they were made before serving them. Also, as many others have said, it is VERY difficult to clean. Gunk builds up and you almost have to use a toothpick to get batter out of every hole and crevice. About two weeks ago the waffle maker would not heat up. I took it apart looked inside and then put it back together. I plugged it back in and it worked and made a normal batch of waffles. I tried to fire it up today to no avail. Today it is going in the trash."
3,Hard To Clean,"This waffle iron does a great job with waffles. The problem is that it is very hard to clean. There are to many small clearances around the waffle iron for waffle mix to cake up if the waffle iron runs over. There isn't an adequate drip edge to catch the over flow.I am going to try the Villaware with the removeable grids. I put whole blue berries into to my waffle batter, and this also requires additional clean up that would be easier if I can remove the grids and put them in a dish pan."
5,Don't waffle over this item,"I am a waffle expert from both sides of the griddle. This is the best in the domestic market one can buy. Simple to use, consistently reliable, and easy to clean. This is the fourth one I've purchased: two for me to use side-by-side, and two to give for gifts to very deserving recipients."
1,broke after a year,I've had this grill for a year..but it stopped working. So..it was great..but i guess you get what you paid for. Its life is as good as its one year warranty!
3,Size Wise,This grill is much smaller than the model that DOES NOT change plates. This model will only hold 2 sandwiches. BE careful.The other model (without the interchangeable plates) is more of a family size. They need this grill in the family size.
2,If you like steamed chop meat!!,"I have this grill and I just cannot take the white, sickly looking hamburgers it creates. I do exactly as the instructions say and still get a steamed - rather than grilled - burger. I'll stick to the frypan. The meat inside is gray even though I do not overcook it. It cleans up nicely though. Also, it dries the heck out of pork chops."
5,Excellent addition to the kitchen!,"This is the best counter-top grill on the market. I like it better than any of the Forman items. It is light weight and medium sized, so it works great on the counter. The grilling panels and the drain cup come completely out for easy cleaning. Also, the lid will fold completely back and flat for open grilling."
2,HANILTON BEACH INDOOR CONTACT GRILL,I INTENDED TO USE THE GRILL FOR PANCAKES AND AM DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HOT ENOUGH.
3,OK but poor thickness flexibillity,"We purchased this last year to replace a previous grill. We don't like it as well as the previous one, primarily because the hinge mechanism has limited flexibility -- for thicker cuts, the grill touches a lot more in the back causing uneven cooking."
2,Forgive me George for I have sinned!,"Ok, so it has removable plates that you can wash separately, this is the ONLY bonus to this item.It takes forever to cook something as it doesn't get hot enough, the plates don't lock in very well and the item is way too bulky for such a small cooking area.So you can lay it flat to cook pancakes - whoop de do, my frying pan works just as well.I was hoping for so much and was very disappointed in this item."
3,"Darn it! It was soooo good, too!","I really liked the sound of this grill. The reviews were good. It had more features than my old George Foreman grill like the timer and the removable grills. Then I used it. The coating started to come off immediately. Just a little on the ridges at first. I've been careful. I washed it the way they said, I did everything right and it just keeps coming off. I am disappointed because I seriously like this grill. Makes a super good boneless pork chop. A little sea salt with garlic and man, soooo tasty. But as fast as the coating is coming off, every time I use it, I doubt it will last too long. And I haven't even used the flat griddles yet."
5,Beats George's Hands Down,"We subscribe to Consumer Reports and read all about these types of grills. The George Foreman and the Hamilton Beach MealMaker Express Grill seam to be the most popular but the HB beats ALL the competition hands down!Many people who already have the George Foreman grill all have told us they hate it because it's so difficult to clean. With the removable grills on the HB model, this problem simply does not exist. We love how fast this grill cooks chicken and steak. The best part is that the meats are so juicy and delicious.I highly recommend the Hamilton Beach MealMaker Express Grill."
3,Grill,It's great to have a timer on this grill. Works great. There are 3 negatives about this grill. Too bad the hinge doesn't allow for thick sandwiches & the timer could be louder. The other thing is that the plates do not fit in flush with the grill. There is some play in there. I would not buy another one for these reasons. May not matter to you but it does to me.Sorry......
5,I love this contact grill,"I love this indoor grill. It cooks everything wonderfully and clean up is a breeze. It is so much bigger than the other grills on the market, I can cook four large chicken breast at once."
3,Not hot enough?,"Like the last reviewer, it also seemed to me that the grill wasn't getting hot enough. Meats were getting seared but just barely, and the recommended cooking time gave me very rare meat instead of medium. Panini-style sandwiches didn't get crisp. However, when I increased the warmup time to ten minutes, I got much better results with both meat and sandwiches. Maybe they cut the power output?It seems to work fine with the longer warmup time, and I haven't experienced any other problems with it. The removable grids (ahhhhh) are sweet. The unit seems well-constructed overall. The timer seems to work fine. I'd rather it had a true floating hinge for easier grilling of thick items, but I've never seen a grill designed for meat that had one - only panini presses - and it hasn't been a real problem with what I've cooked so far."
4,Works Great! A little slow to heat.,"I like it, I really like it! I've been using George's grill for years and it was fine but I always hated cleaning the darn thing. With the HB just take the plates out and toss them in the sink full of soapy water. Simple. The grill doesn't cook anywhere near as fast as the George Foreman and is a little slow to get up to speed but I'm not in THAT big of a hurry to eat. It works fine. Its well built. The drip tray design is much better. On a scale of one to ten I'd have to give it an eight. Hope this helps."
5,Great Grill,"Since I got this grill a few weeks ago I have made steaks, cornish hens cut in half, salmon steaks and pork ribs. The food comes out crisp on the outside, moist on the inside and the cleanup is very easy. The grills come out and just needs to be wiped with a soapy sponge in the sink; the body of the grill never really gets dirty but occasionally you can wipe it with a wet paper towel. This is an unbelievable product!"
3,Bottom Grill Plates lose the non-strick quick,"I've had this grill for about 9 months and except for one thing, I love it. The bottom plate stick free coating started coming off and is 80% gone now, in less than a year. I like this grill so well, I've willing to buy a new bottom plate but can't find one, not even the the Hamilton Beach site."
4,Special Price,"Las week or before Christmas, Amazon offered the Hamilton Beach 25325 Mealmaker for only $29.99. It's now $59.99. When will Amazon offer that price again?"
3,Self damages over time - no customer support.,"I've had a 25325 for a couple of years and I really like the removeable grill plates. The problem is that, over time, the plastic strips that houses the grill latches become deformed and charred from the heat. I called customer service and they cannot/will not provide replacement latches. They claim it only happens when the unit is operated without the plates installed (that is NOT the case). Their answer is a new grill and it would be a warranty replacement if the grill was less than a year old. This is a pretty handy grill, just don't expect it to last. When I replace this one, I'll shop for similar features with better engineering."
3,"Cooks beautifully,... for about a year","I have owned two of these grills. My first one, was slightly smaller than this model, but it lasted 4-5 years, and was used frequently. I replaced it partially because I wanted the larger model, and partially because the non-stick surface, was not so non-stick anymore, and a great deal of scrubbing had become necessary. So with great eagerness I set out to used my new improved larger grill. It was great, for about 3 months. That is when my cooking knob broke off. I thought hmm well it was only plastic, but the grill still works so I just used needle nose pliers to turn the dial. At about 6 month the non stick surface started to war away. Well It has now been 1 year and 3 months and I threw the grill in the trash today. The non-stick plates are completely shot. Perhaps this particular grill was just a lemon, as the first one lasted 4-5 years, but I think 15 months is not long enough."
5,Love it!!,"I absolutely love my grill! I use it almost everyday. It is super easy to clean, only takes a few minutes to warm up, and cooks the food fast! This grill makes it easy to eat clean as I'm on a journey to a better body. I've been tempted to buy another one to have just in case this one breaks later on down the road."
4,Terrific for Panini's,"Found this works terrific for Paninini's but the grill and broiler are far better for steak and meats. The temperature isn't quite high to truly sear steaks, etc. Terrific clean up- easily handwash plates."
4,Cooks everything better than the Foreman except bacon,"Definately a better product than the George Foreman. Removeable grill grates is heavenly. People no longer get skeeved out when they come over and see my grill on the counter (I gave up cleaning my old George Foreman....aahhh the joys of being a bachelor).The grease catch is much better too.My only knock and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is it takes longer to cook bacon than the George Foreman. It takes 10 minutes to cook bacon (and it comes out PERFECT), but I don't remember the Foreman taking that long. I think it is because the grooves in the grates are much deeper."
5,The Best I Have Tried,"My HBMME arrived yesterday and I have already given it a thourogh check out. I couldn't be much happier unless it cleaned itself. Although the cleanup is easier then any grill of this type I have tried, especially the George Foreman line. The one thing I was a little leary about was the fact that I had read some reviews that said the grill did not get hot enough and didn't leave grill marks. This is what I didn't like about the other grills I had tried. But the hamburgers and boneless chicken breasts I have cooked on it came out perfect. I highly recommend it."
1,Dangerous steamer,"I had a George Foreman for a couple of years and it was great: easy to use, regulable temperature, safe to handle.This Hamilton 25325 is nothing like that.First, it's dangerous. If you want to open it you need long protective gloves. Otherwise you'll get burned by both the handle and the (very large amount of) steam that this thing creates.Second, it lacks basic features like regulable temperature and safe handle.Third, as many others have said, this thing *boils* your meatFourth, food retains a lot of fat because the surface barely tilts downwardsFifth, it takes ages to cook something. With my previous foreman I could put a frozen steak and have it ready in 15 minutes. With this thing, 15 minutes are not enough to cook non-frozen steaks.Sixth, the steam weats it all around.In short, do yourself a favor and don't buy this thing. You are going to regret it from day 1."
4,Simple and Easy,"I considered getting a George Forman but ultimately got the Hamilton Beach because of the removeable grill. This grill is a good size. A George Forman of the same size would be much more expensive. The timer feature is also another great perk. Basically this small appliance does what it is supposed to. It won't make your food taste WOW, but it will cook it decently. Just don't get it expecting your food to taste like backyard barbecue and you will be happy with the product."
4,Great Grill,"When I tried this grill for the first time, I threw my old grill in the garbage! this is the almost perfect grill, the only thing I would change about it is, I would give the back a little more hinge room to open wider, to get even thicker products inside.Cleanup is a breeze with the heating plates being removable, much better than my old grill.I was in the market for a new grill when I found this one and could not find one to match the price either.Great Grill!"
5,Far Better than my George Forman,"The removal of the grills make clean-up so much better. Also,it really cooks evenly and fast. I would like to see a model avail. with a tempreture control.....Then I would own two (2) of them. I also use my grill for our camping trips because the wind has no adverse effect on it,s cooking function..Thankyou. AZ"
3,8 years Use - Not PTFE free,"Pros - Excellent durability, convenience, ease of use, cleanup.After 8 years of use several times a week, it is still functioning well. My concern, and reason for the lower rating, is the known problems with the Teflon type nonstick finishes with the carcinogenic potential at high temperature. All of the manufacturers currently seem to be using the same type nonstick material at this time. The lower cooking surface is starting to flake off, exposing the aluminum metallic surface, which is another health hazard. Fast food preparation, easy cleanup prevents me from discarding it, and waiting for a more advanced (ceramic or anodized) nonstick surface prevents me from purchasing another to replace mine.Tip - For thicker items I put our full teapot on top of the grill for added weight while cooking to increase the contact of the upper plate, and flip after 4 minutes to cook on the other side."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed to find i could not grill meat with a bone in it. I was hoping to use my grill to cook t-bone steaks, and pork chops. I tryed grilling hamburger for pasta sauce, but the grill was a mess when I finished. It took a lot longer to clean then my regular fry pan normally takes. I am not sure what I will use it for as we only cook burgers on the barbeque in the summer. This products takes up alot of cupboard space for so little uses."
2,Missing Spatula,"I'm really disappointed with this order. The package did not include the spatula which is supposed to be included with the order. However, the Hamilton Beach 25325 MealMaker really works great as advertised. Where's my spatulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"
4,An interesting collection of essays,"The essays come across as a collection of authors synthesizing books that they've written. Nonetheless, it is a very nice way to sample some of the literature in this field. Some of the essays, particularly the first few, tend a bit too much towards the legal theory and less on the institutional side. I particularly enjoyed Robert Barros' essays on constitutionalism in Pinochet's Chile - he provides a fascinating argument for how institutions and law can in fact bind dictators under certain conditions. Now, this book did come out before Tom Ginsburg'sJudicial Review in New Democracies: Constitutional Courts in Asian Cases, and the literature on law and politics has only exploded since then. Still, I'd recommend this book to anybody interested in the field."
4,It's good value for its price,"I needed a food chopper badly, so I'm glad I made this purchase. It does a good job, it's incredibly cheap and the size is indeed very compact. However, I have to say, that even for a one-person household I find it a bit too small.Even an onion has to be chopped in halves, the whole onion would be too much for it. If I was to buy a new one I'd go for a bigger one."
3,Breaks easily,"I have received 2 of these choppers. The first one was broken upon arrival in the top of the container. I returned it, then received a new one very quickly. I've used it a few times, and it was wonderful. It chops things up very small, and very quickly. Unfortunately, it has now craked in the same place as the first one. As of this point it is still usable, but I will not purchase the same one after this one completely breaks!"
3,Chops,"My wife bought this 5 years ago and it hasn't skipped a beat. It's great for onions, sometimes leaves a skinny piece uncut but pretty good. It however doesn't do well on peppers or herbs. Peppers it doesn't cut through the skin and I've tried it on Rosemary which it pretty much just burnt. I'm giving it 3 stars based on durability and the fact that I use onions a lot and it saves me a load of time on those."
3,It chops,"Maybe I'm using it incorrectly but I generally end up with purees (for things like onions) rather than chopped pieces. It's great for making things smooth, like squash soup, and it's good for mincing garlic. I don't cook large quantities because I generally just cook for myself, but I would still recommend something a little bigger than 1 1/2 cups!"
2,Fell for the Glowing Reviews Here,"My old food processor/blender stopped working after 20 years and so I needed a new one. I decided to buy a mini processor/blender and after reading the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Proctor Silex 72500RY. Big Mistake! I tried making a dressing with ginger. I cut small slices and put it in the chopper along with some honey, mustard, and a little water. Some tiny slices of ginger never got chopped no matter how many times I tried. Very frustrating. I should have shelled out more dollars and bought a better chopper!!"
3,not sure why people love this?,"it seriously turns the stuff into baby food... I guess its my fault, I shoudl have just bought one of those hand choppers, I mean seriously, this will take an onion and turn it into puree. it doesnt work for spinach either. not worth the hassle to return so I will eventually give it away. if you are near zip code 92627 contact me and I will sell it to you for $5. I used it one day, washed it, and put it back in box."
5,Great chopper,Great chopper! My first Proctor Silex chopper lasted over 18 years! It was accidentally dropped and cracked the canister. Use it on a daily basis.
2,Cheap chopper,"I have had and used this chopper for about a year and the plastic container cracked after a few months and now part of the base of the plastic has broken away making the chopper useless. I had hoped to replace the container, however, a search on-line has resulted in 0. Since I really like a mini-chopper that is electric I will buy another brand."
3,My Old one needed replacement after 20+ years,This is O.K. but compared to what I had it is cheaply made. It doesn't chop as well as the old one I hadthe food (turkey lunch meat) gets caught in the blade and it binds. UGH
5,food chopper,"The food chopper is great. Easy to use & clean up is a breeze. My daughter used mine to prepare meals for her 10 month old while visiting, she was so impressed I ordered one for her also."
4,Efficient little chopper,"This is a handy chopper just right for small amounts without dragging out the big processer. It operates by turning the lid to right or left to start or stop, no buttons, putting you in instant complete control of the chopping. It's easy to take apart and clean, and reassembles quickly and easily as well. The only thing I could wish for was that it was actually made in America, but I guess we can't have everything. Overall, I'm very pleased with it."
4,Good product,"Works great for the price. I wish the blades had closer tolerance to the bottom of the bowl, as uncut slabs of veggies can remain there sometimes."
4,"Very tiny, but good for one","If you are just making small amounts for one or two people, this is great. So far I've used this to make small amounts of salsa for just myself (I live alone) and it has been perfect for that. I can see using it for small amounts of pesto or other small portions, but it definitely is small enough that you aren't going to do much in it. For my purposes? I rarely use a processor and only need a bit when I do, so it's perfect."
3,Cheap,Works fine but if it leaks through the lid. You have to turn the lid for the processor to start. I did not expect this function. I thought there was a button like other mini processors. Because you have to twist the lid food leaks through the lid. I used almonds to make pesto and it kind of made a mess. You get what you pay for. I will use it for as long as I can.
5,Proctor Silex Food Chopper,"My second one. Perfect for that small chopping job. Makes chicken salad, turkey salad, egg salad, ham salad, shrimp salad and tuna salad sandwiches tast better being ground up finer than cutting with a knife."
4,Proctor Silex Food Chopper,"I have a Magic Bullet & it is hard to chop anything in it without it turning to mush.The Proctor Silex Food Chopper doesn`t do that.It`s quick,easy to use & easy to clean.I would like to eventualy get a bigger one to do bigger jobs but this little one is perfect for me because I recently had weight loss surgery & need smaller portions.My mom also has one.I would definately reccomend this product to anyone."
4,chopper,Its a bit smaller than i thought but just what i needed for the few times I use a chopper. It works well
5,food chopper,"I got this chopper because I wanted something to use for small amounts, and this chopper works great for this job."
4,Proctor Silex food chopper,"Had this one before but it was getting old. Buying the same one again means something, right? It does chop well except sometimes pieces get stuck under the blade."
1,TOY SIZE FOOD PROCESSOR.,1) IT IS TOO SMALL 2) IT TURNS THE VEGETABLES INTO A MUSH IN ONE SECOND. 3) IT WILL NEVER CHOP VEGGIES LIKE IN THE PICTURE.
5,Awesome Album!,"This is an impressive album for the whole family. It is a unique and refreshing blend of music that is educational, energizing and Fun! Every parent and child must get to know ScribbleMonster and his Pals!"
5,Great Fun and Exercise for the entire family!,"Our son saw the subskate in our local pool store sales ad and HAD to have it! He chose to use his birthday money for it. He has the orange one. Being a skateboarder, it was the perfect activity for the pool.This was last year - May 2007. Here it is May 2008, and it is STILL one of his favorite pool toys. He gets the subskate out every time he gets in the pool. The entire family has tried it out. His friends have enjoyed playing with it as well. It still looks as good as it did the day he got it. It is very sturdy and has held up to a LOT of tough ALL BOY play.I have to admit when I first saw it I thought it was not very impressive, but he wanted it so much and it was his birthday money. I am glad he got. He has had so much fun with it. His balance has improved for skateboarding and martial arts. It took a few tries to get the hang of it, but then he was having a great time with it."
1,Glorified Flotaion Toy,"My boys didn't find the subskate all it was hyped to be. It is basically a glorified flotation toy. It is a great size to bring to the pool and lake, but we don't feel like we are ""skating"" or ""surfing""."
5,A Sharp Idea,This knife works extremely well and can fit a modest budget. This is the third one I have bought because the other two went to members of my family--perhaps I can hold on to this one.
3,I've Used Better,"After having had a CORDLESS electric knife that finally bit the dust, this was very unwieldy. The worst part of this knife was that the blades were too short, as I've notice on most electric knives."
1,bad design,"The knife is very difficult to hold on to and press the button, it doesn't fit the hand very well at all. The knives are very sharp, but not long enough to slice through a small roast. Should be ok for bread.This is the first electric knife I've ever used, so I can't compare it to any others, and not sure I'll ever try one again."
5,sisterkathleen123,When the two brackets I bought arrived there were no screws to attach them to the wall. I wrote a review stating that at that price I thought screws should have been included. I received a phone call asking me to change my review if they sent the screws. When the package arrived there was only one screw and it was the one to hold the flag in the bracket. I received another phone call asking if I pleased with the screws. I informed them that only one arrived and that it was the wrong kind.The company has gone out of their way to try and correct the mistake. and now I am waiting for refund of $8.00 to reimburse me for the money I spent on the screws I bought.In every way the young lady I spoke to tried to make up to me for the money I spent and the inconvenience I had.
3,Baby Advent calendar,"Not truly what I expected. However, I gave it as a gift and the recipient liked it. Be aware that it is an advent calendar - one opens the ""doors"" to the weeks as they pass and there is information within regarding baby and mom. There is limited space for mom to document pregnancy happenings."
4,Sound Scholarship Based on Extensive Research,"Hansen's ""Saffron Wave"" is among the best of the recent spate of publications on the rise of the BJP and transformation of the Indian political landscape that has accompanied it. Based on a comprehensive incorporation of previous scholarship as well as a great deal of field-work primarily in Maharashtra state, Hansen is in absolute control of his material. Indeed, though the introduction is a bit clogged with ""theoretical"" ruminations, even the Lacanianism is put to good use. Thus, what seems at first gratuitous and extraneous to the argument, is well integrated over the course of the text and enables some Hansen's richest insights into the sort of mentality that is responsible for, among many things besides, the sort of indecent ranting seen in the review above."
1,Truly Bizarre,"A discussion of hindu nationalism in India which does not include the Shah Bano judgement or the Khalistan movement, is like discussing civil rights in the USA but never mentioning the dred scott decision or Abolitionist movements.I have previously been contemptuous of claims that foreign scholars use India as a kind of laundry bag into which they stuff their more eccentric theories. However, after reading texts of this type, I realize this is only far too kind a characterization.Instead of this drivel, I would recommend the writings of M. J. Akbar (leading indian political journalist) as much more insightful. His ""India: The Siege Within"" is a nuanced and careful work. Other excellent commentators are Mark Tully and Khushwant Singh. oooops, I forgot, they are mere indians and not resident at some BIG US/European university...."
4,"The Stranger, March 2000",Disjunkt is wide-ranging and often outrageous. You'll quickly realize that describing these livewires along other bands' lines just doesn't cut it.
4,Blue....,"Theo, a hip, young, Berlin callboy, lives his life alone. In the hotel room he takes his shower and his money. Business is so good he can pick and choose his clients. Marie lives next door with her boyfriend Paul who one day leaves her. Shattered,Marie retreats into the darkness of her apartment....When Theo knocks on her door they slowly discover that love is possible in the most improbable of places..."
5,Excellent film despite the sub-titles,You fall in love in the main character and hope that he finds the love that he is looking for in all the wrong places (i.e. with his tricks and next door women friend).
1,I hate this coffee grinder,I had the Krups fast touch grinder for 12 years and loved it. It only finally died because I cleaned it with water. I replaced it with this Krups grinder and it makes a huge mess. The stainless steel design seems to cause an excessive amount of static electricity so the coffee dust goes everywhere. I've put up with for about 6 months and today I am ordering the original fast touch which is still available in black and white.
1,"Complicated, messy","I've used several grinders over the years and this one is by far the messiest and fussiest to use. First, the cover of the machine must be carefully twisted into place, and after each grind, the track upon which it is twisted becomes filled with ground coffee and must be cleaned out mechanically (simply turing the machine upside down and shaking is insufficient). Second, thanks to the wide-mouth design, it is difficult to empty the coffee into a normal-sized filter without creating a mini-explosion of grounds on the counter."
1,Makes big mess!,"I had a Krups grinder before and loved it, so when I lost it bought this one, big mistake. Everytime you use it and open it, coffee grounds go everywhere."
2,$30 For A Coffee Grinder! That's Too Much!,"You can get a nice coffee maker for $30! Just use a regular blender to grind your coffee beans OR find a cheaper coffee grinder. But anyway I don't grind my coffee anymore, I just buy it already ground. It's just a lot easier."
5,Healing Children,"This book is an amazing, gentle roadmap for children that will heal both the child and the parent."
4,Clear ideas for helping a grieving child,"With the recent death of my former sister-in-law, my 7-year old nephew needs help dealing with, well, everything. He moved to a different town, started a different school, lives a different life all in addition to losing his mom.Nobody in our large extended family knew how to deal with the whole concept of helping a grieving child. It just wasn't something we ever had to handle, thankfully.Then I got this book. It's clearly written and provides actual ideas and approaches that we find working. We're helping my nephew get through some of the anger, internalizing, and just general sadness with the help of this book. It also explains a lot of what we see him doing - something we all needed with this foreign concept.If you have a young one who needs this kind of help, this book is money well spent."
3,It is ok.,"To be honest, I only really bought this CD for one song; Nexusbeta-Parallel Fates. The rest of the CD was pretty good, and Kristine Sa does have a rather soothing voice."
1,BAD SINGING!!!,"If you like high pitched annoying whiny type voices, you would like this. Her singing? Not off key or anything, but there is no gusto or power to her voice. Listen to the Natalise samples, the other Asian singer, it's a similar type of overly girly, weak voice. If you like voices which are strong and powerful that can catch your attention and touch you, these girls are not for you. No, I'm not racist, I'm also a singer AND I'm Asian. Makes me wonder just HOW these girls get contracts. Being able to write and compose music doesn't automatically make one able to SING. The lyrics are also OVERLY generic in that corny pop song lyrics kind of way. There is no depth to this album in her singing nor her composing this album. Very disappointing, I would love to see an Asian artist that can come out and SING with a HUGE voice. Maybe it's this whole conspiracy in the U.S. to make Asians seem feminine, hence the weak singing voices."
3,Adequate...,"Well, here is my 2 cents about this singer.Kristine Sa has a nice enough voice, deep and smooth.But her songs aren't very good. They miss something whcih results in the songs sounding amerteur-ish, and un-professional in my opinionm which also leads to a non-desire to listen to her.I think with a better song writer she could do much better with her voice which is not that bad.Anyway, it's an OK CD to have, but nothing mind blowing."
5,Great Little Pitcher,I had been looking for a pitcher that I could use for gravy and sauces. This is perfect! It has a wide pour spout and is just the right size. I don't like conventional gravy boats because the gravy seems to get cold pretty fast and they aren't easy to pass around the table.
1,Too hot!,"The size is great. The presentation beautiful. The price was awesome.On a ""low"" setting it boils..does not simmer. It is too hot!Have tested it on 2 recipes and have had to throw one of them out..I am experienced cook and was replacing a 30 year old crock pot!Was a wee bit hesitant to do another one today, fortunately I came home early enough to salvage it!It is definately not a ""slow cooker""..6 hours cooks everything!Am sure that the ""wraparound "" heat has alot to do with it!Am in hopes that Rival will arrange a FedEx pickup and replace the unit!I spent hours shopping for this!Should have gone with the Farberware!"
2,Uglystick,Is a good pole but not for big fish. Isnot worth whatthey saytheregular price is at all but for the sale price it is a dependable fishing pole for your small fish
4,fishing rod,"I have received the fishing but, will not be able to use the rod until summer as we live in Alaska. Thank you"
5,Good and affordable,"I got this to carve our Thanksgiving turkey. It is solid, smooth, and comfortable to use (our turkey was on the small side though). We've since used it to carve roast chicken and other roasts and it works well. Easy to clean, too. Great value."
4,Great early 17th century church music in English,I used to have some of these on an LP. I missed them over the years and it was good to hear them again.
4,Love it,"I love this can opener. This is the 2nd one of this style I have had. What I especially like is it opens the can around the outside edge, so it doesn't fall inside the can and the opener doesn't get dirty. Just takes a little practice to get it lined up right."
1,Krups Master Can Opener Is A Dud,We purchased this high-end can opener because of the safety of the lid removing process and the quality that is supposed to be associated with Krups. The thing didn't last a year and we don't even open a can a day. It basically fell apart. The cutter can't be serviced with a simple replacement part. I won't pay to fix it or buy another one. We replaced it with a manual opener that does the same job for under $10 and it's easy to use. Hamilton Beach makes an opener that does the same lid removal for around $20 at discount stores.
4,A Cut Abouve the Rest,"The three most positive things about this can opener are (1) the can lid is left with no sharp edges, making it safer to handle and dispose of. (2) Even tall cans may be opened with this Krups product, as it is hand-held as opposed to standing on a counter with a limited height space for the can. (3) There is nothing to clean on this product. Since there is no ""cutting blade,"" nothing gets ""gunky"" or dirty. It is light-weight and easy to operate by using your thumb to push the button to activate. Since the can sits on the counter or other flat service, a heavy or large can is not a problem.The only problem one may encounter is getting the opener ""connected"" to the can lid. It isn't difficult, it just takes a little getting used to and the pros definitely outweigh the one slight con. I like my Krups Open Master so much, that when I had to live with a family member while recovering from surgery, I took my opener with me."
4,Nice addition to a safe kitchen,"Although this opener is a little hard to use at times, it does a great job of opening cans without leaving sharp edges on the lids. You can also store items for a short time right in the can by reusing the lid.I bought one for my mother-in-law who has had a stroke and can't use both hands. She is able to open any size can by herself and doesn't have to worry about cutting her ""good"" hand. My mother has arthritis and enjoyed using mine this past summer. I am buying one for her for a Christmas gift.This item is perfect for people with children (no sharp edges!), folks with handicaps, and those of us who dislike dealing with sharp objects if we don't have to."
5,Best Can Opener I've Ever Owned,This is a great can opener. You NEVER have sharp edges and removes the lids so easily. I have owned other brands that claim to have no sharp edges but in fact they don't have sharp edges on the lid but do have sharp edges on the can. This is such a safe way to open cans and you never have to worry about metal shavings in your food.
3,The Hygienic Krups Can Opener,"This opener is much more sanitary than the cutting wheel type.I am about to replace mine again, for the second time, even though I find three deficiencies:1. It doesn't last more than about two years.2. It requires careful ""jiggling"" to engage the opener with the can.3. There are some few types of cans that it fails to open.But health considerations win out."
1,It is nice if you like metal shavings,This is my second Krups Open Master Can Opener. The last one was perfect until it died after 6 years. I immediately bought another Krups. This one is not worth a dime. It worked for almost a year and now it opens maybe 3 out of 10 cans and even then it chews up the can leaving metal shavings. I am now back on Amazon looking for a different can opener.
3,Good when it works,"Our first unit worked well for about three years. When it quit opening cans completely, we bought a new unit. It has never worked correctly. I only wish we had advice about how to repair it. When it works it is terrific."
3,Great While it Worked,"The Krups 404-70 Open Master Can Opener was great while it worked. I had it for about two years & was happy with the ""no sharp edges feature"". It took a little bit to get used to the placement of the can opener on the can for it to work. I am very disappointed that after only 2 years it no longer cuts. I paid ... for it and feel it should last longer than it did. I have had regular electric can openers that cost $15.00 and have lasted 10 to 15 years. I was planning on buying another one, but after reading that others have had the same problem probably will not."
2,Won't buy another one of these...,"I bought this opener because I liked the idea of not getting food on the opener blade. After around 2 years of use, the mechanism has worn out and it will no longer open cans. I'm going back to a 'regular' can opener!"
1,"Like most ""safe"" openers","I bought one of these and as anyone who has used a ""safe"" opener knows, they take a knack to get the lid started. I loved it for about the first six months. This is basically a very good product when compared to the manual type of ""safety"" openers in that that they last longer than what I have found to be about 100 cans. The wheel that guides the can to the cutter is made from a material that is much too soft though and repeated attempt at opening a can by someone like a 13 year old will wear the gripping teeth right off. This renders the perfectly good opener useless and thus landfill."
2,Expensive and fairly difficult to learn to use,"I have a manual can opener that accomplishes the same thing, and it cost a little over 3 dollars.My mother in law bought it from a TV advertisement. It's easier to use and works faster and better than this one.A thirty dollar can opener should be able to jump in there, open that can and then some. Alas, this one whirrrrs nicely, debates the task and finally chews its way around the edge. Ahhhhhh finally it opens the can."
1,Like watching a roulette wheel,"Loved this can opener when new. After 18 months, round and round it goes. Place your bets folks...how many revolutions will it take to open the can? Numerous revolutions leaves the can's edge ragged with the risk that metal shards might drop into the food. A very expensive lesson in poor design."
2,Great...when it's working :(,"I agree with the general consensus here that the can opener works great and it's wonderful not to have sharp edges on the lids...but it definitely doesn't last! We actually found someone to service ours after it stopped opening cans after about a year or so, but it was almost as expensive as buying a new one. Now another year or so has passed and again it's not opening cans...I was thinking of replacing it because I love it when it's working, but after seeing so many others with the same problem, I'm going to switch to another brand."
1,bummer,Have had two of these openers and both lasted less than a year and then would not open cans No where to repair them Harmon Wall
2,Blade wears out FAST!,The mechanics of this can opener are terrific EXCEPT for the quality of the opening blade. It wears out in less than a year of moderate use. A replacement blade costs $23 + shipping from Krups so you have no recourse once it quits opening cans except to deposit it in a landfill.We are on our 4th one and have finally decided to go back to the mechanical type.
4,Best Can Opener I've Ever Owned,"The Krups can opener is terrific! I had no difficulty aligning the device with the top of the can, and am amazed at its efficiency. Its compact design lets me store the unit in a drawer, rather than cluttering up precious counter space with small appliances. I only wish it was cordless, but after breaking a cordless device while opening a coffee can, I will gladly trade the convenience of cordless for the power and efficiency of the Krups unit."
1,Caution some cans?,"I purchased a 404, because I had a manual opener that works the same ($12) but I provide the power. Loved it, bought my girl friend one. Two or three months later my girl friends 404 started tearing up the side of the can lip and not opening the can. Mine followed suit a few months later. The cutter seams to have lost it's cutting edge. The only thing that seams to be the problem is steel cans. But that should not break the 404."
2,Sometimes,I loved it when it worked! Mostly I found it lacking in reliability. Getting it to secure was dificult and it quit working altogether in short order. Never again.
3,"Classic Disney film, Poor Quality","I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it in elementary school. It's a great story of overcoming adversity to protect those you love and make something of yourself. However, Amazon really dropped the ball on the quality. Parts of the movie were un-watchable because the contrast was so bad. The VHS version my girlfriend owns is better quality than this, and that's pretty pathetic in this day and age. That being said, the download was very fast and, as mentioned before, it's a great movie. Definitely recommend buying, but stay away from Amazon Video on Demand if at all possible."
4,"Fantastic, inspirational, and thought provoking!","This movie was about a girl who goes against society, dares to be herself and saves her familys pride. Mulan is more than a animated movie it's a lesson in life. It teaches children, and adults, to not always follow the crowd but to be true yourself and and have pride abut yorself. This movie was time and money well spent."
5,Fantastic,"I watched this movie with my five year old neice,Lindsey. You should have seen the excitment in her eyes as she watched this movie. Thanks Disney for all the great movies."
2,way boring,way boring chinese tale with eddie murphy inexplicably doing the dragon's voice. plot is slow and only the occasionally amazing animation saves this from putting you to sleep after 5 minutes.
1,Mulan,Did not notice when I purchased this item that it would not work on dvd players in the us...my fault but what can I say. I contacted the vendor but he didn't even bother to respond.
1,Reject the Disney formula.,"Please tell Walt Disney that you do not like to have your intelligence insulted. Do not see their movies or buy their cheap plastic garbage. As several other reviewers stated, the kooky side-kick characters are just lame. The lame stereotypical depictions of good and evil were very shameless (big, dark, neanderthal-like villians with red and yellow glowing eyes? please). One might argue that these films are fun for the kids, but that may not be true. In driving for profits, Disney sacrifices quality and artistic style for a bland product, geared towards pulling profits. This is an unfortunate phenomenon, because any appreciation for art fails to be conveyed to the audience. This problem can also be seen in the new Star Wars film, which likewise strives to pull profit rather than be at all artistic."
4,not the best disney film but definately the best villian,"shan yu was the highlight of the movie for me. the scary yellow eyes, the deceptive bird on his shoulder, the hun army, (finally theres henchmen that dont act like dorks. a first in a disney flick.) perhaps the best since scar fron the lion king. i believe this was the last great traditional animated film from disney. then they took a nose dive afterwards. i go to art college and study animation. this film and its villians are one of my inspirations."
3,Mushu is funny!,"This is a tale of a young chinese girl who steals her father's ""call to arms"", cuts her hair and disguises herself as a boy so that she can join the war instead of her father. She has a little dragon with her, Mushu (voiced by Eddie Murphy), sent by her ancestors to protect her from danger. Mushu is the highlight of the movie! Though the lines are not quite as funny as what you'd expect them to be for Eddie Murphy, he is the best part of the show.Good movie. The animation is wonderful. It's just not one of those movies that my family requests to watch very often at all. It is at the back of the pile of Disney movies now - waiting to be requested again. It is worth seeing once - from there you'll have to form your own judgement as to whether it becomes a family favorite - or just a once in awhile movie.1smileycat :-)"
1,HORRIBLE,IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS RAN OVER BY A TRAIN. THE DVD WAS ALL SCRACHED AT LEAST IT PLAYED. I DIDNT RETURN IT TO NOT GO THROUGH THE HASSLE BUT COMPLETE WATSE OF MONEY NEVER BUYING HERE AGAIN
1,Wrong Language!!!!,I didn't know I ordered the wrong language!I can't even play it because it says it's not in our region!I am so Upset!!!!!!
1,Very disappointed in Amazon,Unfortunately I did not read the small print!! My grandchildren were very disappointed since it did not work on their DVD player. I am extremely. Disappointed in Amazon for even carrying or selling an item that most likely will not work in the U.S.!!!!!!!!
3,Mulan,"The DVD was sent very quickly, arriving before the expected date. When I watched the movie, certain lines in the film could not be heard...you would not even know a person was speaking until the closed captioning was on. Very disappointing. Luckily, only a few lines in the entire movie were missing from the sound."
3,"Everything about the movie was great, but it took way too long to ship","The movie is great, but it arrived about a week after it was supposed to."
5,Not just the Female stepping out,"True, in this beautiful Disney tale of a young chinese girl, Disney gave us a strong female heroine who did stand up and create an ancient ""women's lib"". But beyond this, this movie is sheer eye candy. With beautiful scenery and breath-taking computer animated scenes, this movie is by far my favorite. Not to mention GREAT characters. Eddie Murphy adds hilarity to the tiny dragon Mushu. I recommend this one highly!!!!"
3,"I hate to say it, but I agree with the critics.","When the movie trailers for this film came out, I thought, ""GREAT! Finally an animated epic adventure from Disney! Looks to be better than Sleeping Beauty.""But it's not.Mulan is a comedy. Sure, it's the tale of a girl in search of herself, but her sidekicks (Mu Shu and Krikee) steal the show. And the sidekicks are only on the screen to be funny. Don't get me wrong, they are funny! I constantly recite Mu Shu's lines...But...The plot of Mulan was a bit too predictable.The animation quality is excellent and the sound (on DVD) is THX... meaning it's the BEST. But this isn't enough to make a great film.If you're looking for a Disney comedy, this is a good movie for you. But if you are looking for an animated adventure, go find ""The Last Unicorn"" or ""Watership Down."""
1,Mulan,This movie had several freeze spots that skipped right over long moments of the movie. I am now gonna have to repurchase it elsewhere.
1,a blank CD,a blank CD in a Mulan case -- a ruined Christmas gift. I lost my shipping costs and my granddaughter doesn't get her gift!
3,Video artifacts,"I enjoyed this movie (given that it's typical Disney), but the video transfer is definitely not the 4.5 that Widescreen Review gives it. There are terrible artifacts throughout the movie (these are particularly prominent because it is animated and thus the artifacts are more noticeable). I expect this is because they compressed the picture more than usual to fit both 4:3 and letterbox onto one side of the DVD.For people wanting to collect this movie, I definitely suggest waiting for an anamorphic version of the movie with good compression."
5,Stellar!,"This is the best disney movie that I have ever seen, and my new obsession. The animation is fantastic and the story is inspiring. Mulan is a good role model too."
5,We Love Mulan!,"My entire family-- including aunts, uncles and grandparents-- watched ""Mulan"" last Christmas and loved it. The story, a young Chinese girl fights in her injured father's place against the Hun army, is more complex than many animated movies. The nuances about culture, family honor, ethics and values, and how to take risks that others might not take, add strong issues to the plot and sub-plots. Above all, ""Mulan"" is amusing, a good story, adn fast-paced.I enjoyed the music, which is rare for me. I also loved how feisty Mulan was. And I sure didn't blame her for falling for the guy-- he was so CUTE!"
4,Mulan has heart.,"Mulan fits well in the long line of Disney's princesses who make us laugh cry and sing. She was a welcome addition after a long getaway from the happy go lucky princess story line. not only did she keep up the high par of romance and adventure, she broke boundaries that disney had not yet crossed. an adventure where the princess was not only a heroine of the story line but a heroine of her entire country. kudos to Mukan and kudos to disney. An absolute MUST WATCH film."
5,"Fun, exciting, great plot, wonderful cartoons--A must have!","Fun, exciting, great plot, wonderful cartoons--A must have"
5,"True to your hart , and show the world what you believe in","I love Mulan ! I bought it on the opening day ! I like the Part where Musheu gose , "" What you mean a luser ? How a bout if I poped one of your atanias ,then threw it across the yeard then whos the luser, me or you ?"" I laffed my head off at this pioent . And at anouther pioent where musheu says , "" let's go kik some hunnybuns ."" Know that i lffed my head off too ! I love it ! Watch it and find out who you really are inside !"
2,"Bah, a big disappointment","Disney has done it again: transforming a wonderful legend into a pointless and silly comedy. I thought this would be a strong feature but it's often ridiculous (The ancients spirits doing a party...). If you're interested in a film dealing with asian culture, choose Mononoke Hime."
4,This film is quiet good!,I think this product is quiet good because it includes alot of bonus feature and is quiet a good quality!
1,Movie is in German,This movie was the German version. Did not realize that when I ordered it and it does not have an option for English so it is u usable here in the united states
5,on of the best,Mulan is funny and emotional at the same time.It has great music.Everybody should own this video on February 2.
5,Best Disney video for girls,"As a teacher and a mother, I believe Mulan is the best Disney video and story for young girls. Mulan is not a princess, but an ordinary girl that does extrordinary things. My daughter was cheering and wanted to learn to ride a horse, instead of wanting to marry a prince. There is no kissing in this film and only a hint of romance. Definitely kid friendly."
5,Mulan,"This is a hilarious movie! It's fun, charming, and intriguing! The music is wonderful as well! My personal favorite is I'll Make A Man Out of You!"
4,mulan,great movie great dvd inexpensivegood birthday present glad i bough it and will use it for many years to come;
2,Dvd will only playing on German dvd,"dvd would not play on any of the dvd players in the house. when i change my region on my computer to germany it play on my computer only, but my family doesn't watch movies on the computer so this dvd is useless."
3,mulan,"the dvd was great. it's was beautifuly redone. but the reason I brought was not only to have it on dvd but to have the points from the Disney reward program.. sadly this didn't come with any, even though the box said it did."
3,Pretty Good,"Mulan is somewhat of a disappointment. The artwork is OK. Mulan (voice of Ming-Na Wen) is a very head-strong young girl who joins the Imperial Army in place of her father. But disguised as a boy. The background design does not do justice to the Chinese landscape. This version is changed from the original Chinese text. The ""comic relief"" becomes annoying throughout this film. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
5,Perhaps the most underrated of the Disney animated movies,"I'm not sure why this movie isn't as acclaimed as many of the other Disney animated movies. Great story, great soundtrack. I honestly like this movie better than the Lion King, which is considered by many to be the best of Disney's lineup, but which I find to be very overrated.I'm anxiously awaiting for Mulan on Blu-Ray."
4,Pretty good movie!,"My daughter liked this movie, as well as myself. Definitely a must for you Disney collection. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has there own little princess."
1,Was not in English!!!! And site didnt say it wasn't!!!,I got this as a gift and when given it was not in English and had no way if changing it to English. I am very upset but this and the person this gift was for was so heartbroken! Contacted the seller waiting to see what will get done about this but wanted to let anyone looking to buy this to make sure you get English if that's what you want don't just trust what is on the site.
4,I think it was supurb.,"This movie was one of the best Disney Movies I have Ever seen.The only the I didnt really enjoy was that there was not enough romance between Shang and Mulan. I mean it just ended, they didnt even kiss a little bit. But I do think they should make a Mulan 2."
4,GREAT !! but not for young children,"Mulan is a favorite to me. it's excellent in matters of characters, making, and music. smart and funny too. but the only hitch is that I regret that I have showed it to my little ones because:1- they got terrified at the shan-yu introduction scene2- they learnt the skill of spitting from Mulan (tsk tsk)other than that, I think it's worth the buy and a treasure of a Disney movie to keep."
1,Not too sure,"I was really excited, I had bought a ""used"" Mulan movie. I understood I was buying a second hand DVD movie. Which never really bother me, but when I finally got it in the mail. I open it, and their was a small scratch on the dvd. Now, like I said I know I was buy a used one, but I didn't know they would sell one that has a scratch on it. So I played the movie just to see if everything is ok. Then I notice in the middle of the movie it wasn't playing right. So now I will be returning it."
1,LINES ARE MISSING!!,Is it me or is it the film? I watched my copy of the special edition the other night and there were words missing from the dialogue in various parts of the film. Now I wish that I didn't give my gold version away.
2,Very Disappointed!,"Mulan is a very disappointing movie.It's heroine, though more stronger than past Disney leading ladies, lacks the magic and appeal of Ariel and Belle. The comic relief is way over-the-head, and the ending is not very romantic. The only gem is Jerry Goldsmith's epic score, it makes Alan Menken's music look like amatuer's night.Overall, I declared ""Mulan"" with ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" and ""Hercules"" as one of the worst of the ""new-school"" Disney classics."
1,Poor quality DVD,"Do not buy from this seller. I bought a copy of Mulan and it skips, freezes, and goes in and out of focus. Very poor quality product."
2,Tired of feminist proselytizing,"Disney (and Fox in ""Anastasia"") have fallen into a very predicatble and enervating P.C. rut. In a trend that we got a whiff of in ""Little Mermaid,"" a dose of in ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Hunchback,"" and a full-blown shot of in ""Pocahontas,"" Disney just can't seem to get away from stylized, idealized, P.C.-normed women. The only problem with them is that all the same: boring. Sooo predictable. If Disney wants to preach their gospel, they can do it on their own time and their own dime. As Sam Goldwyn said: ""Include me out."""
1,disappointed,"We watched the movie on the computer. The image was pretty good, but something was wrong with the sound. Even with the volume turned up to maximum level on the computer, we could barely hear the sound."
1,mulan [ Region 2 ],I got this movie because its one of my favorite. I guess I didnt pay close enough attention to detail because i am unable to watch it. It says im in the wrong region. Amazon did everything right i just wish i would have known what region 2 meant.
1,Mulan DVD - Region 2,"Perhaps I should have known, but when purchasing the Mulan 2-disc set, I didn't notice that it was 'Region 2' and had no knowledge that this meant that it would not play on American DVD players. This label didn't show up on the original listing - it wasn't until the second screen that it said it, and there was no warning that I found that described what 'Region 2' meant.My daughter was disappointed on Christmas morning."
3,good but wrong,"First i say this is a very good movie but i see very severl things wrong with this movie it is very histiricaly wrong First i recetly moved to mongolia (Where the HUNS are from,Mushu ""Now thats what i call MONGOLIAN barbqe"") First Shin Yu not a mongolian name it is a chinese name.And his eagle (A mongolian eagle) would be more than half his size. And the huns do not speak chinese. But almost all mongol soliders would be in full uniform. Now the most inportant...THE HUNS REALLY DID TAKE OVER CHINA IN REAL LIFE! Yeah they did.But it is a good movie."
4,Nice movie about my culture compared to other Disney movies!,"The Disney version is different from the real story of Hua Mulan. In the real one, the Imperial Army didn't find out that Mulan was a girl until afterwards. Also, in the true story, there was no talking dragon named Mushu nor was there any cricket named Crickee. There are some flat characters and stereotype in the story, but it still shows a lot about my culture."
5,It's just perfect!!!!,"The back grounds seem so real!I like how they turned a nobody into a somebody.It's a little confusing that a a real skinny woman such as Mulan,can destroy a powerful man like Shan-Yu!"
4,Finally! A heroine who did the saving!,"Now if some of the humor wasn't so smart-alecky and rude, and the drawings were a little more Disney classic-this would be a perfect movie. Mulan is really a terrific heroine (and I mean HEROINE heroine) and her voice is A+ (when she isn't trying to sound like a man). Great movie alert!!!!!"
5,Enjoyed this movie!,I finally got to watch this movie and have to say that I personally enjoyed it very much. The children seemed to enjoy it as well.
4,Very good,"This was a good movie worth seeing. I gave it only 4 stars though because there was so much implied violence, but that was difficult to avoid given the plot. Though there was a lot of implied violence, but my 4-year old didn't know what was happening. Disney did its usual good job of implying any violence in a way that younger kids who don't already understand death and killing already, aren't left with questions due to the movie. With Eddie Murphy doing the voice of a major character, it is good watch for adults too."
5,One of the best Disney movies,This may be one of the best Disney movies. Great message for both girls and boys without being preachy or overtly politically correct. Just a kid who loves her family and her country.
4,Mulan,"I liked this movie pretty well, although a lot is sadness. :( and they pray to thier ancestors even though that's not true. but Mushu (little dragon) says some funny things. and mulan has a couple funny lines too. it's a pretty good movie, besides all the stuff about praying to thier ancestors."
1,The Worst Piece of Trash Disney Has Ever Made,"I did not think they could make a worse animated film than Hercules. The animation was horrible, the dragon took away from the story, the ending was stupid and cheap, and it was incredibly boring. I suppose a two year old would find it enjoyable. Maybe."
1,Vastly disappointing,"This could have been so good ... and it's nothing at all. I gave up on it after thirty minutes, tired of the stereotyping (Mulan at the camp and the whole Be a Man song), the horrible attempts at comedy (Eddie Murphy should not have been in this movie), and the lackluster score. Reflection was an all-right song, but not memorable nor something I want to hear again.The animation is stunning, but eye-candy can't replace characterization and plot."
3,Could be better,"There is lots to love about Mulan. A wonderful score, great animation, lots of good vocal talent.The biggest area in which the movie fails, however, is the scriptwriters' irritating overuse of comic relief. They have a tendency to interrupt scenes quite inappropriately forEddie Murphy or Harvey Fierstein to deliver gags. It gets immensely tiresome. I'm divided as to whether this is worth three stars or four; but I'm opting for three."
1,"Can""t view it on my DVD player","I tried to play the DVD on my DVD player which attaches to my TV and it wouldn't play, says something about the region. I can play it on my laptop only because it props me to change the region on it."
2,I AM NOT GOING TO RECOMEND THIS MOVIE.,"IT'S BEGINING TO GET PERDICTABLE WHAT DISNEY MAKES FOR MOVIES. FIRST OF ALL, DISNEY TAKES A STORY OR LEGEND, SCREWS IT UP, AND MAKES A MOVIE OUT OF IT. MULAN IS A RIP-OFF OF CHINESE CULTURE. THE WOMEN LOOK LIKE JAPANESE WOMEN, THE ARMOR LOOKS LIKE SAMURI ARMOR, AND THE SWORDS LOOK EUROPEN. HAVING FUNNY SUPPORTING CHARATERS IS BECOMING LAME. THE ONLY THING I LIKED ABOUT IT WAS THE HUMOR, BUT THAT DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR THE STORY. ITS PERDICTABLE THAT MULAN ISN'T KILLED WHEN THEY DISCOVER SHES A WOMAN.DON'T SEE IT IF YOU KNOW WHATS GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I loved it,"I loved Mulan! The dialogue was great, and the story itself was very well done. I have nothing but praise for any movie that can take me from tears to laughter in the space of two minutes. I was initially worried about Eddie Murphy's role (must every Disney hero have a silly sidekick?) but his character, I thought, only added to the movie. He was really good at being comic relief and at helping to move the story forward. In fact, I thought he did a better job than most of the other sidekicks! This was one of the best movies of 1998, and the best Disney in years. I look forward to buying it and watching it again and again."
4,The dragon wasn't necessary,"Overall, the film is excellent! The dragon, however, was not necessary; he was more of a distraction to the epic sweep of the movie."
4,a great movie with good animation for thought,"Excellent disney flick. One of the best it's put out so far. Though it wont jump out at you like Alladin, any child would enjoy it."
4,Overall a Excellent Movie,"Mulan Overall was a excellent movie and I prefered the ending to the normal Disney, they kiss and live happily ever after stuff. I speak Mandarin and I didn't like her being called ""Fa"" Mulan, a Mandarin person wuld call it ""Hua"" Mulan meaning flower. Please! Not every Chinese person is Cantonese. I am offended that way. And when she had her first day of training, bacon and sunnyside-up eggs are not what the Chinese eat, it is Western. How does she jump high enough to get on the roof to escape from Shan Yu? Is it all the adrenalin? Mushu was a nice addition making it funny but ""Bessie"", the name refering to Khan, was wayyyy after the Huns attacking and Mulan."
3,i think it wasn't to bad but they need to add some stuff,"i like the scenes and stuff but they need to tell us more like why did mulan go to fight and a gril stronger than man thats like the strongest man ever, balonie i like the idea of mushu but the rest like why the huns were going to attak china that kind of stuff."
5,SWEET,This is a great movie by Disney and I would recommend it to anyone. Myself and my friends all liked it and we are ever teenagers!!!!
4,Disney continues to out do themselves!!,"I remember last summer when I took my daughter to see it in the theater. I seem to have more fun than she did. But we both love it. Disney contiunes to out do themselves. It was a formulated story plot line, with the songs neatly placed in between to set the mood and tone etc. But it was very well done, and I loved the fact that a girl was the hero. Something long over due in cartoon films. And my favorite song is Donny Osmond singing I'll make a man out of You. Plus I love all of Disney's Villians they have the best villians that I have ever seen in cartoons. Frightening and menacing just the right touch. The Huns were bad!! So buy it sit back and enjoy it with the kids. You'll love it!!"
5,girls do shine,my daughter loved this movie.she now wants to take karate because of mulan.go disney go!
5,Loved it.,"I loved it.And this is saying something, because my ancestors were Huns. :)Mulan is a lovely character, the voice actors (Donny Osmond singing, Eddie Murphy speaking) do some of their best work ever. While I couldn't call it faithful to Asian traditions, they do try to observe some, such as the family name coming first in an introduction, ""I'm looking for Fa Mulan.""This is my favorite Disney movie."
1,Its in a European Format,I could not use it and had to ship it back at my own expense. I live in American and this is a European formated dvd. Make sure you are buying American made stuff. Asian and European electronics do not play well with American electronics.
5,Movie,"Everything was wonderful. It came to my house very quickly too, I was very impressed and surprised. I was very happy"
3,Disney Fan,"It is in ok shape. Not too many scratches. A little beat up, but must have been well loved. Maybe not charge as much in the future for items a little worse for ware."
5,Mulan on DVD,I thank the people who sent this DVD to me. It may have been a few years before Disney released this film again. The price was not bad! The second DVD will be of entertainment for the little ones I babysit.
2,"Nice animation, good quotes, extremely bad plot","Disney's ""Mulan"" may be one of the best, but it doesn't follow the original story-poem. And nearly all the songs are horrible.If you really want to see a good version of Mulan, rent or buy the little-known 1961 musical/movie version that was made in Hong Kong. It's in Mandarin but last time I saw the 1961 movie it had English subtitles."
2,"Another (yawn) Disney ""Masterpiece""","It amazes me how shameless the Disney people are, slapping that label ""masterpiece"" on every recent animated feature they've done. And so too with ""Mulan.""This could have been a real provocative piece of storytelling. But once again, Disney plays it safe, following the formula of past successes. We get great animation, but a superficial story. Nothing really insightful about Chinese culture, history, or for that matter, gender, is revealed. The cute ""sidekick"" characters (this time a hip, wisecracking dragon) in these Disney features are getting very stale. The obligatory songs, which often trivialize what little meaning is found in the script, also get very predictable.I keep hoping that one of these days, Disney will really give their talented animators a chance to do a feature like no other -- a new work which will be looked back upon as redefining the storytelling power of this medium. That would be a ""masterpiece,"" and ""Mulan"" is far, far from it!"
