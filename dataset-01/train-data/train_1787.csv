3,Some advise,"I bought a combo set of SpaceBags and when I went to use them, I found some tricks to them.... You have to pack your items evenly in the bag, don't fill the bag all the way up on the zipper, you may want to leave about 4-5""inches empty. When you slide the SureZip Slidder, make sure that you are applying pressure on it and pinch the ends of the zipper together just in case it did not get a good grip. When you vacuum the air out DONT TAKE THE CLEAR PLASTIC OUT, OR THE BAG WONT WORK.Ifound this out the had way. After you vacuum it down, press the CLEAR RUBBER PIECE down from the center to re-adjust it and then put the cap on. THIS WORKED FOR ME HOPEFULLY FOR YOU TO, if it doesn't, dont forget they have a 100% replacement guarantee from the manufacturer (800) 469-9044 Customer Service"
1,Good Concept Cheap materials,I bought a 4 bag combo. 2 of the bags worked the other 2 didn't and lost vacum in less than a day. The plastic these bags are made out of is very cheap and eaily torn. IMHO these bags are a waste of time and money. When the patent runs out on this concept and several manufacturers can make competing products perhaps one will make one worth our time and money
1,The Bad Reviews Are Right -- Don't Buy It!!!,"I decided to give this product a shot. Some reviewers said the bags would work properly if you don't overstuff them -- still not true! A Large bag re-inflated when I put 2 standard pillows in it. So I took out 1 pillow and tried again, and the bag was nowhere near being full. It seemed to work all right, but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated! And if you buy the bags with the zippers, the zippers come off easily, they make sealing more difficult, and one even tore a hole in the bag. I purchased straight from AsSeenOnTV.com, but their return policy looks a little weird. I'm not sure if I'll get a refund. Also be careful if you order straight from AsSeenOnTV.com -- I upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later! I guess the product was just too good to be true."
1,This item is a piece of junk,"I would rate this item --0 stars. I purchased 4 large Spage Bags and the zipper only works on 1 of them. I have zipped and re-zipped these bags dozens of times and they just will not stay zipped. This is the biggest rip off I have ever seen. I have called customer service for help but I can never get through because of the ""high call volume."" I sat on hold for 1 hour and never spoke to a live person. Finally a message came on and asked me to leave a message and they would call me back. They still have not called me back. If you have money to burn go ahead and purchase this item but you will have to either return it and pay postage or throw it in the trash."
1,A waste of money.,"The idea is great, but it doesn't work. I bought 24 of these bags and only a couple of them have been able to hold the air out.A total waste of money."
1,Poor Product,"I needed something to store some large blankets in and thought this product would be a good choice. After reading some of the reviews that stated flaws about this product I wasn't going to puchase it. However on the advice of a friend who had tried them I bought them anyway.The bags were easy to fill, but the zipper closure wasn't very secure. I had to secure it by hand since the ""Sure Zip Slider"" didn't. The plastic is quite thin, but bags deflated nicely with the use of my vacuum cleaner. Overnight, the bags inflated on their own. I was disappointed, but decided to keep the bags for storage anyway. When attempting to move the bags, the zipper closure always popped open and this was when I decided that the bags were worthless."
1,Bags definitely leak,"I purchased an x-large bags and three large bags at Target. I put one of my Mother's bedspreads in the x-large bag, sealed it up and vacuumed the air out. Within an hour it had leaked enough to tell that there was a leak. The bag was not filled up past the fill line. The people on this page who say these bags do not leak must have a vested interest in the company."
3,Worked fine for me,"I ordered the Spacebags when we lived in New England to store out of season snowsuits and boots, baby clothes and down comforters. For me, they worked great.I had no trouble deflating the bags and then stored them all on a shelf in my garage for several months. When I opened the bags, everything was still clean and there was no sign they had ever been stored.Cons: The zippers are so flimsy, I broke a couple bags just trying to stuff them in the first place. Also, the zippers make them difficult to reuse. I never had one reinflate on me, but I didn't get to reuse more than half the bags. Despite this, I would buy them again at the right price."
2,Leaky bags defeat the whole purpose,"These bags leak so easily which defeats the who purpose! On one, the zipper got caught on the bag itself and ripped it, so it no longer worked. The second bag, my cat knocked off the bed and the plastic ripped, creating a hole. Very expensive for what you get. I loved the concept, and I could not believe my 4 pillows and a mattress pad cover compressed down to about 1 foot tall, but good luck! Do a better job of quality with this product and people will pay the money!"
1,they dont stay sealed for more then a few hours. out of 6 bags your lucky if one works as desired.,they dont stay sealed for more then a few hours. out of 6 bags your lucky if one works as desired. they really need a class action suit against them for defective product.
1,Zipper doesn't work properly,I purchased these space bags and was very eager to use them. But after trying to zip up these bags i realise they dont close properly thus causing them not to remain flat.
4,suprised at all the bad reviews,"i recently purchased several boxes of these at walmart, followed the directions on the box and had absolutely no problems with any of them. i did notice that they work better if you line up your vacuum hose with the valve before you turn it on, and turn it off when removing, but the seal on the end works just fine if you do like the directions say and run the little plastic clip along it several times to make sure the seal is good. i was able to reduce 5 large rubbermaid containers of winter clothes to just 3 (and they arent even full) and i LOVE what it does for sleeping bags. the only thing bad i would say about them is that they dont suck down to this little totally flat package like in the pictures - it just generally reduces it from all directions, so its pretty much going to come out a smaller version of the same shape.still, i have yet to run in to a single one that has a seal problem. mine have been vacuumed for weeks and are still going strong."
1,Would not even rate 1 star,"If I could rate this below zero I would. Horribly disappointing. I purchased these for my family's move out of state. They all ripped and became unusable. The ones that were packed in my trailer made everything move, almost causing my $1300 LCD tv to break. Absolutely would not recommend that anyone waste one dollar on these."
1,not worth the money,"total waste of money, they do not hold air out even when you stay within the ""fill"" line. air always seems to get back in. I am suprised these are still being made...."
1,Makes a better trash bag,I tried 3 boxes of 12 over an 18 month time span and so far only 3 bags have remained air tight after 2 weeks. I'll try one more box but that's it for me. I'm surprised that anyone can give this product a good review.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"This product SOUNDS great, but it does not work. Simply put, it is garbage. As a previous reviewer stated, the bags are easy to fill, but leave them alone for a few minutes after you have supposedly removed the air and you will hear a hissing sound as the bag slowly inflates. The seals on this bag are not what they should be: At the very least they should be able to keep the vacuum pressure. I paid $10 for an extra large size at Target---only to realize that the bag is not at all sturdy and probably cost about 10 cents to make. Colossal ripoff. Buyer beware! Not even worth a one star rating."
1,Leaks!,"I would agree. These are horribly made! They leak like crazy. If you are lucky enough to find the leak you can put tape over it, but that is only if you can find it. The plastic is super cheap and will rip on some of your clothing zippers you are trying to store! I would NOT reccommend this product."
1,"Worse than even you feared, with Cust Serv fraud to boot","Do NOT purchase these bags! They don't work, and what's worse, if you call the cust serv number, you will be placed on hold, only to be told five or ten minutes in by an automated system that must leave a telephone number for call back. Then, you never will hear back."
3,"Ok, but not for me","I found that the bags do work. I couldn't pack a lot into them, but it did save some space. I left my bag full of t-shirts out over night and it didn't leak. My cat hates ballons. He put holes in the bag :( So I don't get to see how long the bags lasted. I don't think I will get the bags again. Unless I something to put them in."
4,The Best South African Book,"I rated this book roughly 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 because of the political science mumbo-jumbo at the end of the book. That notwithstanding, this is one of the great books of South African non-fiction as it covers the entire history of the National Party (which, before its demise, was one of the world's oldest political parties). There is so much to learn from this -- that the divisions between the Cape and Transvaal lasted so long, that de Klerk was not the reformer many wanted, or that it was largely a corrupt organization influenced by the church and a secret society. This is tremendous non-fiction."
4,Good stuff.,"Worked well for my hair type. Not all hemp shampoos are equal but the public does need to steer clear of petroleum based, harmful products."
3,they're ok,"they're ok, it's just that they don't fit perfectly, and one makes a little noise. still good for $20"
5,another awesome cd from one of the masters,"This is my third FIRKINS ( HOWLING IGUANAS are just as brilliant ) and they are all full of astonishing guitar work, interesting covers done in his inimatable style and original compositions that leave you wondering why this guy isn't huge.Unlike a lot of others in this genre, he doesn't need to overplay to get his brilliance accross. His main attribute is melodie and a beautifull tone as well as flawless technique. Most importantly, he always sounds like FIRKINS. The musik spans a wide variety of styles and he excells at all of them. CARAVAN is one of the most interesting interpretations of a DUKE ELLINGTON tune your ever likely to hear. The backing musos are also of the highest order. If you like the guitar, you will ove this CD."
4,"Kirtland set a warm, friendly, positive mood","I wanted to see if Cecilia Kirtland's rep as the ""Bonnie Raitt"" of Long Island was a deserved title, and it was. Her voice is clear, smooth, sexy and a delight to listen to. Her music is mild, warm, friendly, great for a date, and not bad for calming me down after a stressful day. She's not a rabble-rouser and doesn't sing about burning things down or putting ex-lovers through a meat grinder, which might be fun to hear her do with that lovely voice, but what she chooses to put in her repertoire works well enough to make me want her company."
1,Huh????!!!!What did I just read???!!!,"This book is listed as being a children's book. Some of the cartoons, scary though they may be, possibly may have some appeal to children; but the story certainly won't. I think the author is trying to push the envelope of credulity and inanety as far as he can to see if he can get the reader to exclaim, ""What did I JUST read?"" The link to this on-line book states that the author couldn't find a publisher. This does not surprise me. I can only hope that there is more to the book than just the seven pages that I saw, and that the rest of the book improves astronomically. I for one would not recommend that you buy this book."
4,Calphalon 32-Inch Straight Wall Pot Rack with 4 Heavy-Duty Single Hooks,"Exactly as described. Does the job of keeping my pots up and out of the way. The pots and pans look nice also, hanging up. The bar is nothing fancy, but utilitarian. I have an Enclume bar which is far nicer and designed much better. Big difference is this one is far cheaper and still does the job. Recommend if function is your main consideration."
3,Excellent for what it is - but Manufacturers Defects Are Bad,"Rack was shipped quickly but arrived damaged. Not from shipping. One of the predrilled holes was completely stripped, so the unfinished (i.e., shiney!) metal shows around the hole -- about 1/4"" in diameter. I ""fixed"" it with black paint and it is only noticeable from very close as I placed the rack fairly high on my wall. All in all the rack is great, I have 8 cast iron pieces hanging from it, there is only a very slight bend to the bar, it is very sturdy. Standard ""black"" drywall screws match the bar's finish perfectly. An excellent deal for $25, especially if your's comes without any manufacturer screw ups!!!"
4,POT RACK,"Great, easy to install pot rack but .... comes with no installation hardware and too few pot hooks. You have to buy extra hooks to make the rack really work."
1,Someone already tried to install this,Imagine paying this much money for an item that someone else had already tried to install and returned but the vendor did not check it out before shipping it out again. It came bent and with obvious scrape marks where someone had pulled it out of the wall. It does not arrive with any hardware to install. Check your item carefully.
3,32.5 inch pot rack,"I ordered this item because it perfectly fit the 32-inch wall space above my stove. When I received the rack, it actually measured 32.5 inches -- 31 inches of bar and 1.5 inches for the mounting. It works great, but I had to rearrange the other walls of my kitchen to hang the rack in another, less convenient spot."
3,Hardware Not Included,"Well, it does what it needs to do and didn't cost a fortune so I guess it was a success. But, it sure wasn't obvious when I ordered it that the mounting hardware was not included! And of course none of the hundred screws that I have in my toolbox match the dark grey finish...! How hard or expensive can it be to put four little screws in the box?!"
3,Bohm As A tree,"If you were to talk as digression and as an internal process of listening to the ongoings of your own consciousness, then this is the book for you. Not many pages from the beginning you discover that you have discovered your end. At least with this book. This is thought as turgidity. Tough going."
5,The Real Deal,"I spent almost 4 months cruising the offerings on Amazon, Overstock, ShopNBC and various department stores looking for exactly the right watch for me, considering elements of style/image, materials, some prestige, a strong price/value relationship, and quality and found Victorinox Swiss Army to be unsurpassed. It is ruthlessly masculine, with none of the gender equivocation and frilliness of oversized watches, shiny metals, or the implied fragility of 'dressy' models; I like the matte finish, lightness and strength of titanium; ""Swiss Made"" on the dial trumps anything that is not-regardless of price; at $139 it's a bargain (unfortunately, a ripoff at the $325 list); the accuracy is consistant, and it's rugged enough to take the shock from the heavy recoil of large caliber magnum firearms. Gentlemen, look no further, this is your watch."
4,Hearts of Iron,For the person who wants indepth gameplay this is it.For me personaaly it was so complicated it lost some of it's appeal.Still a great game.
5,The Best RTS Ever,"All WW2 armchair strategists must own this game. Even after years of playing, the game never repeats itself. It doesnt have the eye candy but it is 100% RTS."
4,Not bad,"Its always fun messing with history. But, there is so much you can't do in this game. It works if you consider that it was made to be played in the perspective of the leader of a whole country. It would be a lot more fun if you could control how a battle plays out or accually see the effects of different unit upgrades in action. Overall, though, its a good game(much more fun than playing a game of risk against AI)."
3,Long,"This is a rather poor simulation, and is way too long (even at the fastest speed). I would like to see a more realistic version of this game with even more options, but with a more user friendly interface. There are too many unanswered questions which could have been solved by a built in manual or interactive pop-up info activated by a right click or etc..."
4,Good Product,I bought tow of these monitors/tv's for my kids rooms. I bought a mounting bracket and mounted this on the wall without any problems. The screen works well and plays tv and video with no problems.
1,junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"AOC the company is lame. Picture blurry when on dvd or tv. Monitor is good though. The company lied to me about the product when I called them about it. They sent it back to me after I told them not to & said it is fine. IT IS NOT!!!!! Gives me a headace. Amazon gave me a refund because ""aoc"" would not. They won't admitt its a bad design. I noticed they took it off the market right after I had the problem.... Don't buy this unless your useing it rarelly for dvd & always useing it for a pc monitor. Also, when you tryed to adjust out the blurryness the unit would just go off. VERY LAME!!!!!"
4,Beautiful story,"I loved this story. I think it will prompt questions of what a parent's childhood was like and maybe encourage some oral family history. The prose and illustrations create a dreamy atmosphere that may be appreciated more by the adult than the child, but it is such a sweet story that I would recommend it regardless."
4,THE JOY OF CHILDHOOD!,"Instead of ""time outs"", spending more time with your children, is the focus of this book. In it, a father and son bond by going fishing together. Out in the peaceful solitude of this natural setting they catch fish, and let their imaginations soar as they cast their lines into shimmering water. Lovely paintings highlight this charming story. Much like ""Where Do Balloons Go?"", by Jaime Lee Curtis, ""Guardian Angels"" by Naomi Judd, and ""A Boy's Summer:Father and Son Together"", by Gerry Spence. All four books are delightful and stir memories of the joy and simplicity of childhood."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book for my younger children (ages 4 and 7) and have tried several times to read it to them. Unfortunately, it simply does not hold their attention. I agree with the other reviewer that the illustrations undermine the impact of a nice little story. While I think the illustrations are somewhat interesting, my children cannot see what I am reading in the confusing and disjointed images. They quickly become bored (an unusual reaction for them)."
1,Illustrations do not match story,"The story is touching and has a nice message. However, the garish, ugly, busy pictures undermine the impact of the story. Imagine what this book would have been like if Wendell Minor had done the illustrations! Instead, the illustrations with their dreadful colors and awful images confuse and alienate children who are the assumed target audience. This will not be a book a child would be naturally drawn to and would stay on most library shelves, which is unfortunate since the story is so delightful."
4,Give it a try!!!!,"I would give this a try, it is not the total cure but it had slowed some of the symptoms. Anytime you can find something to help is a good thing."
2,Typical Outcome,"Disappointing! Boy meets girl, boy dumps girl, boy's father dies, boy meets different girl, boy investigates father's death, boy marries girl, girl deploys, boy gets into trouble, girl rescues boy, boy and girl live happily ever after. This is one novel that, at times, I had trouble picking up, not putting it down. I persevered, however, and finished it."
4,Night Trapped,"Maybe I should have read the other reviews more carefully, but it was only when I bought them both that I discovered this is exactly the same book as Night Trap by the same author, published under a different title for some reason.It's still a good book but don't make my mistake of buying both."
3,Description is wrong,Amazon- These aren't dish towles- they are dish cloths. That would make them for WASHING not drying dishes. Notice the product name and photo. No wonder I usually ignore everything you print. Pay attention.
4,Great source for barbecue ideas,"This book covers all different kinds of recipes and entrees. There are even some wild game recipes for duck and rabbit! Smoking, brining, marinading. It's all covered."
5,"Outstanding, fast, sharp!","This lens is outstanding. Speed and sharpness are top-notch. I use this lens for a wide array of situations and it has always delivered impressive results. Best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. It's well built, sturdy, and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. Canon really impressed me with this lens. I use it with my EOS system (traditional and digital cameras)."
2,Get the 70-200 f/4L instead!,"At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus. To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts. The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on. This is a lens that I have constantly fought with. Don't upgrade to the newer 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.Buy the 70-200 f/4L. It's a far superior lens!"
4,"overall great lens, but not great price","I cannot help but giggle when I saw comments like ""great lens for the money"". It is selling for $440 at here, even on so-called clearance. However, one can easily find the same lens at least $50 cheaper at some decent online camera store, such as B&H, ritz camera, etc. Sad Amazon..."
3,"Not bad, but not great (like the 28-135mm)","This is my third lens, I already have the amazing f1.4 50mm and the truely great 28-135mm IS. Comparing this lens to the 28-135 IS, this lens is very slow to focus, has difficulty focusing in low light, and the photos it takes are not nearly as sharp. On the other hand... it's a 300mm lens - it'll take you quite close to a subject, and the IS means that you can handhold it in reletively decent light. Two big drawbacks - the IS doesn't work on tripod, and it doesn't have a ""real"" USM motor, so you can't mix AF and MF modes, you have to choose between modes with a switch. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably still get this lens, since the next level up (70-200 IS) is four times more expensive, and even the 50-500 is twice as expensive. If you intend to handhold shots, the IS is probably worth it over the non-IS version."
3,"If you need IS at low cost, this is it ...","Image quality is so-so, and the USM is not ring USM, so you can't adjust the focus manually without turning off the AF. The image quality is not terrible, and is actually quite acceptable.If you don't need IS, I would recommend that you get the EF 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM instead, which is about $150 cheaper, has ring USM, and gives you noticeably better images to boot. But if you need image stabilization in this price range, this is the lens to get, as IS is not available on the 100-300.This would also make a good lens for the 10D/Digital Rebel/300D, since the 1.6x cropping eliminates the various flaws and distortions at the image edge that you'll see at the longer focal lengths & wider aperatures when shooting with this lens on film."
1,Bad Customer Service,We have a 4 qt. saucepan of a similar description. The inside bottom of the pan is pitted and chalky. Calphalon has not responded to our request for explanation.
5,You NEED this pan!,"This little beauty is the tenth Calphalon pan I've bought this year, I love them all. This one is perfect for sauces, vegetables, anything you can fit in it. It's a decent size, and the sloping sides make stirring easy. I have straight sided Calphalon too, but this can be used differently. I like the hard anodized finish, great for mashing vegetables like potatoes, squash, and kohl rabi (does anyone really eat that stuff?). I've thrown all the old pots and pans out in the garage for the next yard sale, only keeping the Calphalon and All-clad. Cleans up with a swish of the dobie or a little soaking. Used the Calphalon cleaner on it and it REALLY works!"
1,Designing Effective Instruction,This publication has good content and is well organized but the print is very difficult to read. I am talking about faded grey ink with very small print. The publisher did a poor job in printing this book.
3,Designing Effective Instruction,"You may have some problems with their terminology. They completely blur and mix up analysis and design. They apparently never read the definitions. In simple term ""Analysis"" is taking things apart to figure out how they work and in this case what is needed while ""Design"" is the first stage of creating something new."
5,Great text book!,I needed this book for an online class and was happy to find it so readable and full of useful examples.
4,"Fun, clever, and highly engaging","Correctly referred to as the ""Second Missus Beastly"", this is an important work in the history of Jazz Fusion, with a clever, engaging mixture of brash fun with moments of unexpected emotional and acoustic subtlety that belies what one would expect from the (ostensibly) controversial cover and some track titles.Reminiscent of Weather Report and Doldinger's funkier works, this band's somewhat atypical instrumentation -- guitar, sax, keyboard, bass and drums along with not one, but two flautists in some pieces -- is central to the buoyantly unexpected nature of the album. The sudden and surprising flute solo at the heart of ""Talle"" leads later to a moving and almost mournful trailing off that is the perfect ending of this engaging and eclectic work (the additional tracks added in later releases do a real disservice here by rendering this important effect moot).4.5 Stars. No fusion collection should be without it!"
5,"Comprehensive, and unique.","The Eyewitness Travel guide series offers the best system in travel guide books. The Paris guide is no exception.These books include everything. Street maps, metro maps, museum prices, times, information on EVERYTHING.I left to study abroad in Paris last year, and spent lots of money on essentially useless guidebooks. The only one I used, and the only one I should have saved room for in my suitcase was the Eyewitness guide.I used it my entire semester, finding new things in it all the time that I wanted to see, and just as an essential tool in Paris.The first couple of days, the Metro map was indespensable.This guidebook is one that should not be left at home. It offers hotels, restaurants, museums, and pictures of nearly everything, to boot.I guarantee that this guidebook will not let you down. The Eyewitness guides are all you need, and all I will ever purchase in the future for my travel guidebook needs.Enjoy Paris! Bon Voyage."
4,it was great,"Eyewtiness Paris was my bible when i was visiting earlier this year. I carried it everywhere. The neighborhood maps with walking trails was really helpful so that i didnt miss a thing. plus they sort of took you off the beaten trail a little too. the only not-so-great thing about the book was that the street maps were a little hard to understand because they are on different pages and some streets are missing (small side streets) so i bought a real street map.... other than that, i plan to use eyewitness books for all my future traveling."
5,All you need to see and get around Paris.,"My wife and I just returned from 17 days in Paris and this was the only book we needed. This book is packed with information that is useful and easy to find. The street and train maps are great, the tips are useful and the pictures are wonderful. We carried two other books to Paris with us, but once there, we left those in our room and bought this book. If you are gong to Paris, get this book."
5,The ultimate toursits guide to Paris!,"I took the Paris Eyewitness Travel Guide with me last summer when I visitied Paris for the first time. The travel guide has excellent descriptions of what to see and do in Paris and the hitory of the town. It includes maps to the quarters, and a very usefull Metro/RER map.If a tourist were to find themself in Paris with no other information besides this book, he or she would be ok!"
2,Useful info but almost impossible to use,"The book is a cute, appealing size. It lists many good bars, places to eat etc. But it has a major flaw: No matter how hard I searched through the book, I didn't see any mention of arrondissements, which are the various numbered neighborhoods.Everyone in Paris and every map uses these numbers to direct you. ""It's in the 14th."" for example. Well, with this book I had to constantly reference other maps then locate the street and see which arrondissement the place was located in. I'm not just venting. I was really disappointed I had depended on this book as my only resource.Additionally, because it combines neighborhoods - I assume to save space so it can maintain a petite, portable size - that is confusing as well and also prevented me from being able to map the named neighborhood to the arrondissement.My recommendation? Bring this book only if you can bring another. It's really not worth the price considering the hassle."
5,It was superb! The best travel guide !!!,"I have traveled all over the world, this was truly wonderful"
4,"Buy also ""Knopf guide restaurants of Paris"" ISBN: 067975578","If you want to get a warmful, visual approach for your next ""aventures gastronomiques"" in Paris."
2,"If you know NOTHING about Paris, this guide is okay.","This guide seems to be designed for the traveller who knows nothing about Paris. If you already know that in Paris you will eat croissants, see Notre Dame, and use French Francs, much of this guide will be useless to you. And though the book is full of pictures, they are so busy that they overwhelm the important information. Further, the book is divided into ""quarters,"" which do not necessarily correspond to the Parisian arondissements; this makes cross-referencing between this book and any other nearly impossible."
2,This book didn't help us navigate Paris at all,"I purchased this book because of all the rave reviews, and after the experience of trying to navigate Paris with it, felt I owed it to future travelers to give my input. This book was fine to read on the plane trip over, and the plane trip back, but if you are looking for a book to guide you through Paris pick up a different guidebook. The pictures were nice, but messy. The maps were awful. Cross referencing with other books was impossible."
4,Good stuff,"This is an interesting review of Mexican Psych. I was curious to find out if Mexico had any psych music going on back in the day. I'm glad I can once again rely on the Love, Peace & Poetry series to take me back in time, with a journey through the center of my mind. The music here is good, not excellent. I cant wait to check out Mexican Psych from the Sublime Frequencies label. Everything that I've heard on that label is top notch. Also check out the comp 'Turkish Beats and Delights' (Gökhan Aya). It's an amazing Psych comp. But this one is good, and totally worth checking out, if not for the cover alone."
2,Pretty fragile,Have to be careful when you press down over the dough. Pretty fragile. Hinges are plastic and will break with too much pressure. Think I wouldn't go with plastic again. Metal would be a better idea.
4,Decent,"One of the larger ones broke while making ""pizza pockets"". The hinges could use a bit tougher plastic. Other then that they function well enough."
4,Good price.,I have not used this set yet. But I like the various sizes. It's made of thick plastic and looks like it'll last. I'm cautious with my belongings so these will last me awhile. Can't wait to start making asian dumplings and empenadas with them.
3,cozy couch,This replacement pitcher was just what I needed. Although the company that shipped it wasn't the best. But the product did arrive with little damage.
4,replacement,We had a Mr. coffee Ice tea Maker and the pitcher needed to be replace the new pitcher is just like the old one.
4,Mr Coffee Replacement Pitcher and Accessories,The steeping bucket does not drain as throughly as my original one. But the handle on the pitcher is more ergonomcially designed and it is easier to grip. Plus I love the BLUE instead of the old red.
2,Toxic chemicals in plastic,"I've owned and used this iced tea maker for over 5 years now, without knowing that the continued heating cycle that all iced tea and coffee brewers go through to make iced tea and coffee are releasing extremely high amounts of petrochemicals into your tea or coffee. It sad that are FDA relies on data from the petrochemical industry on the safety of their plastics instead of doing their own independent studies.Stick with glass or stainless steel, unless you want to pump you and your loved ones full of carcinogens!"
2,I still haven't received it,"I'm not saying the actual product isn't good because I haven't received mine yet. I ordered it at least 2 1/2 weeks ago and received an iron instead! The company is in the process of rectifying the situation but its taking a long time. They also have not offered any compensation for the mistake. I thought buying online would have been a simple way to go, but maybe I should have gone to a store instead. This is not an Amazon mistake, but the company that ships it out."
1,Trouble with shipping to the correct address,"This was ordered with the map. The map was delivered to our Crystal Lake, IL address and the pitcher was delivered to our FL address. We will not be in FL for several more months so I guess it is sitting on our front porch. The Ice Tea maker that needs the replacement is in IL. I am very disappointed in the shipping dept. for not reading the ""send to"" address correctly. How could they send the two items to different addresses when they were ordered together??Anne Reece"
2,Broke,"I bought this to replace a broken pitcher and after just a few months, this one broke too. Will be looking for a new iced tea maker rather than replace the pitcher again."
4,Perfect replacement,"This pitcher was a perfect match for the TM1 tea maker and the teabag holder. As with the original pitcher it replaces, the one bad thing about this pitcher is that it's not dishwasher safe."
5,Use it every day,"Our whole family loves iced tea year round, so this tea maker is used every day and hasn't failed us yet. We have owned it for over five years now."
4,Excellent Replacment,"My last pitcher had cracked a while back and but I kept using it , then another crack formed and made it useless. So I decided to order a new pitcher rather then tossing the hole Ice Tea maker away. Was a good decision and the new pitcher is a bit better constructed then the original one I bought 4 years ago."
5,Includes the filter too!,"As good as new, because they are. And the best part is that it includes a new brewing filter to go with it."
3,Three Stars for Jos the Gardener!,"Parts of the book were good, but it did not need to be as long as it was (440 pages). It could of been told in 340 pages. Jos was attractive and senual character. Julianna was supposed to be so strong and intelligent yet she didn't know that during the night she lost her virginity? Didn't she see the evidence? Pretty stupid! Did the author really think the reader wouldn't question this? Does she think we are as stupid and Julianna? Julianna, also, behaved quite silly in her resistence to marry Jos. Jos was the only reason I gave this three stars."
3,Nice with some issues,"Even with the hard-anodized treatement, food can (and will) stick to it, no matter what. It is better than simple steel and not as bad for you as teflon, but you need to be prepared to do some cleaning other than just soap and water. And no, it can't go in the dishwasher."
2,Calphalon Commerical Hard-Anodized 8 1/2-Quart Saucier with Lid,"Although the quality of this product looks good, I was very disappointed in the thickness of the pot. It is very thin compared to Calphalon I have purchased in stores."
3,Calphalone,"I like the saucier.Three things I would like to mention1,I wish it had come inthe originl manufacturer's packing especially when you want to give this as a gift to somebody.This gives an impression it was used2,The packing needs to be improved.one box came with the box open.Luckily the item was in good condition.3,Earler Calphalone dishes used to be manufactured in USA.Now it is made in China"
5,great pot for the price,this is a great pot.. yes it is big but it's supposed to be.. i make alot of rice dishes and this pot worked wonders when i cooked for 15 people.. i paid only 29.99 for mine on the friday sale and i am extremely happy.. the only difference i see in the china vesus ohio product is that one has shiny handles and the other has a dull finish on the handles. i agree if you only want to pay the price you would pay for a Tfal pot bought from kmart then you have no right to complain. Only complain if you are paying the $200+ for this pot!
2,It's not nonstick,I purchased this item because I needed a nonstick pan in this size; I was disappointed the first time I cooked in it and all the food stuck to the bottom. It works fine for soups and stuff but not meat with tomato sauce or rice.
1,Mark in the inside cover of the lid,I have not yet used the items very much yet. After the first use I noticed some marks in the inside cover of the pan. I do not know how it happened and how to get rid of it. I am kind of disappointed to see this mark.
2,Har anodized 8 1/2 Quart saucier,"i AM REALLY ENJOYING THE POT, AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. GREAT VALUE AND COOKS GREAT"
4,Very good = very pleased,"Easy to clean, quick and even heating, extremely functional. Well worth the money I spent."
2,too wide,"This pot is so wide that it takes forever for water, soup, etc. to boil--there's too much that is not under the burner and is not getting heat, so it's hard to get the pot to a nice hot temperature. It probably takes 2x as long to boil water for pasta in here as in a normal stock pot."
2,"Disappointed with ""Made in China"" product.","We've always bought Calphalon knowing it was made in Toledo, Ohio. We were extremely disappointed when this piece arrived and it was made in China. This pan also felt thinner and more lightweight than the other Calphalon pans we own. Otherwise good size."
5,Love it,"I purchased this saucier several months ago and love it. I have the starter set of Calphalon which includes the large stockpot but wanted a big flat pot for cooking filled pastas and chile sauce. This is great. It provides the usual Calphalon even heat distribution but lets me keep a better eye on what's going on in the pot, since I don't have to peer into a 10"" deep pot. Much easier to clean also, since I don't have to submerge my arm up to the elbow to reach the bottom. Highly recommended, and the [price] I paid through my Gold Box is a great price."
3,It was a phenomenal saucier till they switched,"The one we bought for ourselves more than an year ago, the ones made in Ohio are the best. Food does not stick and the saucier retains its color and can handle a lot of damage.The two we bought recently as gifts were a huge disappointment. These were made in China (I dont have anything against stuff made in China) and in this case, the quality was a fraction of the original. I dont feel its right for Calphalon and Amazon to continue selling these in the coat tails of the former when the quality is vastly inferior to what they sold before. So buyer beware."
3,Nonstick,"This is not a nonstick pan. It sounds dumb... but it is closer to stick resistant... It certainly is not as nonstick as my Analon pans. But, I love the width - it's twelve inches wide. It is not wider than your other twelve inch pans... just compare them. Most people are surprised becase it is taller than any other twelve inch pan they have ever seen, and because few people have seen a pan that is taller than three inches and wide at the same time. Other than that, wash this pan gently. It cannot stand heavy duty washing. Even a scotch scrub is a little too harsh... Great pan, great great deal. You won't regret it. I use it for soups, braising and my large stir fries... like three or four servings of fried rice or something like that...well, best of luck"
2,Calphalon 8 1/2 Qt. Saucier with Lid,"While I love the size and huge browning surface of this pot, I find that it simply does not brown evenly on my radiant electric cook top. I have preheated the pot for as long as 15 minutes on a medium to medium high temperature, and I find that the surfaces around the perimeter of the pot simply do not brown. It only seems to cook the items which are placed in the center. I am repeatedly shuffling the items from the center to the outer edges of the pot as they are cooking. In addition, when liquid was added for gravies or stews, it seemed to take an unusually long time to come to a bubble."
3,TOO BIG,"Hi,I bought this two weeks before but never used. because tooooooo big and heavy. if your family is big then you can think of, for a family of 2 or 3 it is unnecessary."
4,BECAREFUL!!!,JUST FYI THIS POT IS ROUND NOT OVAL... I THOUGHT IT WAS AN OVAL POT BUT WAS SURPRISED WHEN IT ARRIVED AND WAS ROUND.. ALSO ITS A GREAT POT AND COOKS FOOD WONDERFULLY BUT ITS A BIT LARGE FOR STOVE TOP COOKING.. IT WORKS.. BUT I FIND YOU DO INFACT GET HOT AND NOT SO HOT SPOTS.. ITS GREAT FOR OVEN USE OR FOR STEWS.
1,Why is this so cheap?,"I received this pot as a gift and thought it would be great for certain dishes like osso buco. The coating on the bottom wore away and I was going to send it back to Calphalon. But after seeing this sale price of $19.99, it's not worth the postage. Goes in the garbage and I'll stick to All-Clad."
3,Hot Handles,"I really love my Calphalon Saucier. I love to use it to brown my meats because of it's not stick ability. The only complaint I have are the metal handles. They tend to heat up when you cook, so a hot pad or mit is recommended. Maybe if the had a rubber or plastic covering of some sort."
5,I LOVE THIS PAN!!!,I have always loved my Calphalon pans. I saw this one day and thought it was the same as one of my other pans. I didn't realize it was even bigger!!! YIPPEE Perfect for large amounts of Summer Corn!! EXCELLENT PRICE.
4,Great Pot--some Tiny Flaws,"We really like this pot. It is very large, holding big amounts of soups and sauces for large groups. Handles stay fairly cool too. A couple problems we encountered:-It is very wide causing our burner to be very centered and not evenly distributing heat all the way out to the edges.-Can be a pain to clean *especially* if you scorch something in it.Overall, an excellent product. Would work best with large burners."
4,Not good for browning,"This is a very versatile pot and it's great for pasta (especially ravioli since they have enough room), soup, stock, and the occasional lobster or crab. You can even use it as a big roaster for hams and turkeys.However, the bottom is not thick enough to retain enough heat to brown meats unless you have a fairly powerful burner. I have found that the pan cools too quickly and the meat boils before it can caramelize. The four and seven quart Chef Casseroles/Dutch Ovens are better suited for browning and braising in the same pot."
1,Disappointing Quality,"I bought eight pieces of the commercial series of Calphalon and have been very disappointed. The 8 1/2 qt saucier has lost the hard-anadozed coating on the inside and is down to the aluminum, and the skillet has damage to the coating from using metal utensils. I have always hand washed the cookware, so there is no reason, other than use, for the problems. I now use plastic or wood utensils only, but as I replace pans, such as the saucier and skillet, I will purchase another brand and go back to a heavy stainless steel. I had hoped for more than a few years of good looks and good service at the price I paid."
4,It is a very good product,I like this product. When I bought this I didn't know that this would be very big in size still I liked it when i received this Saucier. Handles do get hot sometimes. Heat conductivity is great. Never put it in the microwave otherwise you will lose it.
3,7qt pot,"This is great for preparing large meals, soup, and stewing whole chickens. easy to use and easy to clean."
5,"Great pan, incredible price","I received my 8 1/2 qt. saucier about two weeks ago. I've used it almost every day since. I love Calphalon's hard-anodized series already, but this is my favorite pan. Its very versitile, and like all hard-anodized Calphalon, it cleans up like a breeze if handled properly. At this price, you can't beat it."
5,highly recommended,"Even though this pot is not considered non-stick (I don't think), I have had no problems with food sticking to the bottom. The size is great for when I don't want to use my 12 qt. stockpot and when my 5 1/2 qt. is not quite big enough. Food cooks quickly and evenly. Love it, love it!!!"
4,A bit too large,"For my use its a tad too large in diameter. However, it's everything most Calphalon products claim. A good buy for the money."
5,I Do Love This Pan,"This is one of the best pans I've ever used. It's large, but the heat radiates out from the center, so food cooks evenly. It's easy to handle and cleans up fast. After a big pot of chili, I just had to soak it for a little bit and the residue came of with just a swish. It's big enough that I can store my smaller pan inside of it."
4,Love this pan!,"We use this pan all the time. It is equally at home on the cooktop or in the oven. We have a gas cooktop and the bottom of this pan is heavy enough to distribute the heat quite evenly. It does not have a non-stick coating so use of a cooking spray is recommended. If food does cook on, an overnight soak with some dish detergent followed by a light scrubbing with a ScotchBrite pad cleans it right up."
5,AWSOME. HUGE WITH SQUARED OFF BOTTOM FOR MORE COOKING AREA,"I just love this saucier with lid. In fact, they were only $20.00 when I bought mine, so I bought 5 with free shipping. I kept 2 for myself and gave the other 3 away as wedding gifts. A saucier like this one is a must for every home. I use mine all the time.Alex"
2,The bottom warps quickly.,"The bottom of my pot started to warp after I used it for a short time. I even made sure that I waited for the pot to cool off before I washed it or soaked it in cold water. I was careful, but it still warped. So, I was really disappointed at this. Once the bottom has warped, you can't really flatten it. Since it is Calphalon, I didn't expect this to happen."
2,Not as good as i expected,"I was kind of prepared for the size of the saucier- based on the helpful reviews. I decided to go ahead with the order because of the `great deal'.But after using the saucier 4-5 times in the past week, i am regretting buying it. The food sticks to the bottom as much as for any other ordinary vessel. Therefore now i don't feel like using it now since cleaning is a pain. When i made a stew with milk today, the milk burnt at the bottom, even though i took the precaution of stirring regularly on medium fire.I wish i hadn't bought this item"
5,The Perfect Pot!,"Got this pot a couple of weeks ago and have used it to make a big pot of chili and a big pot of clam chowder. It's a great pot! Yeah, it's big. But that's one of the appealing things about it. Even with its size, it's not too heavy to wash. And it cleans up fast and easy. You certainly can't beat the price. I'd recommend this pot to anyone. And I think I just did."
3,"Usual Calphalon Quality, But the Size...","This saucier has the usual lovely Calphalon qualities--cleanability, good conductivity, nice weight, BUT (and it's a big, and I do mean BIG, but) it is far too large for the urban dweller. In a large country kitchen with a big range and/or oven, this would be ideal, but I've found that I just cannot get enough even heat under this on my range (I'd need to get all four burners going--leads to uneven heat) and forget about the oven! I'd recommend this to someone with my dream kitchen, but, for now, sadly, I'll be donating this to a soup kitchen that has the range and oven for cooking in the almost industrial quantities that this allows."
5,"good blender, but leaks","The blender is powerful, but only after a few uses mine leaks :-(update: I emailed oster letting them know it was leaking, and they sent me a brand new blender.update: got the new one, does NOT leak!"
2,Problems,"The blender would be great if not for the many issues.LCD screen does not turn on the 1st time. I had the blender replaced, and the second one had the same issue. Also, the cog that sticks out of the base broke free from the base. I was only chopping ice. Not a good product."
1,"Nice features, but lots of issues","I bought it because of it's nice design and high tech features. I also liked the metal housing, so I bought it. First issue was a leaking jar, received a new one from oster and it leaked too. Bought the glass jar, it worked good until all the plastic tabs on the bottom broke off and the unit thought that the jar was not on top of the blender. Then after a year the cog broke while making ice cream shakes. I have thrown it in the trash and will buy a cheap blender next time. Oster should have gone back to their old roots and built a sturdier machine for what they charge."
5,What!? I mean WOW! kids review,"this camcorder/camera is a very small one actually. i expect it to be bigger but it can fit almost anywhere!For me, a fourteen year old, it was a rather shock that i got to know how to use it as soon as i looked at it. You can find all the buttons easily and for something like us who love technology i suggest you buy it if you want to have a tiny thing. It's also easy to find with such a bright color. i got pink and love it!"
1,nothing but shameless self-promotion,"Do yourself a favor and pass this one by. It is by no means a history of drag racing. Rather, it's the NHRA practically breaking it's arm patting itself on the back. Racers who don't cowtow to the ""Gods in Glendora"" are largely ignored. Can you believe Garlits is hardly represented at all?! Many other gaffes abound. Not a winner."
5,Right on facts,This book brings you behind the scenes and workings of the fastest sport in the world. Read this book and you will find yourself sitting at the poll in a top feul drangster.
5,Lets Go Racing,Anticipated this book for years. Very glad that it was finally published. Who better than the NHRA to author a book about the quintessential American sport? Read it cover-to-cover in one sitting. A gem.
1,"With NO mention of ""Big Daddy"" Don Garlitz....","With NO mention of the name ""Big Daddy"" Don Garlitz, I would call this book incomplete and JUNK.I wouldn't use it for a coaster much less display it on my coffee table."
4,Very Good,"First of all, remember that they are what they are: sugar-free candies. Sugar substitutes generally create laxative effects, depending on the person, that can range from mild gassiness to, well, let's not get into that. I think more than one piece is safe--at least 3 or 4 in most cases--but it depends on you. And that's not the fault of the candy, it's the territory in general--most, if not all such candies have that effect.That said, this is one of my favorite diabetic-friendly candies. They taste very much like the sugary ones I ate as a child. Everyone will have their favorite flavors, but the selection they have is bound to be most satisfying; the flavors are good, the taste well-crafted.The one drawback I found: if left too long, they will start to congeal or melt in the wrappers. One time I ordered them and it took a month or two for this to start happening; another time I ordered them, they were already starting to go.All told, it's a product I will be buying often over time."
3,Fills the void for a sweet and sour treat w/o the calories of sugar!,"I loved the red, orange and yellow but the green had an odd taste. It's unfortunate that I only got 2 yellows...they were my fave! I'll try ordering them again, hopefully I'll get more yellows!! I do recommend these."
1,Not good,"These looked so good, but the sugar free product is very laxative, so eating more than one can be a mistake. I can't recommend them, and I don't plan to buy more."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE CATRIDGES!!,"I have had very poor luck with replacement catridges from my Canon Pixma 950, and these are just the latest in a string of completely DOA (dead-on-arrival) non-functioning cartridges. Not only did the first cartridge fail entirely - during a mission-critical point when I needed to print an airline ticket due to a family emergency - it never printed a single page, and failed all print tests, head cleaning exercises and test patterns. Every one of the 3 cartridges failed completely, leaving me unable to print anything in black at a critical juncture.NEVER BUY THESE CARTRIDGES...THEY DO NOT WORK AT ALL!"
1,DOES NOT FIT CanonPIXMA Pro9000,"Mislead by Amazon website, this cartridge does not fit our printer - the PIXMA Pro9000"
4,Saga's Rock Opera! Lots of great stuff here--,"The Who's tommy meets Pink Floyd's The Wall! Saga has many great songs and little ""hidden"" parts all through this ""Rock Opera"". Great addition of organ sounds to the already great mix of dueling keyboards & guitars. Don't think that the 1st song (or any song) is an indication of the next. There's definitely a wide range of styles and surprises here."
3,Conceptual Gamble,"Obviously a concept album based on a book of the same name, Generation 13 is not your typical release from these prog-rock masters. It's a hard listen to be sure and if you know nothing about the book, you are lost indeed. It doesn't get a lot of cd player time for me but I do applaud Saga for taking chances. Very interesting vocals from Jim Gilmour. Very good sound quality."
2,Not typical Saga,"If you're expecting typical upbeat Saga with the usual stunning synthesizer performances and catchy beats, you won't find it on this CD. It is a definite departure from classical Saga like Worlds Apart and Silent Knight. For better or worse, Generation 13 is an attempt at rock opera. I found this CD very upsetting as its' theme revolves around a disfunctional relationship between father and son. While listening to the tracks, you start to wonder which band members' childhood was so terrible that it needed to be rehashed in his work. If you're a father (like me), or an unfortunate victim of an abusive father, the content of this CD will probably not be agreeable. I personally still prefer their classic work from the late 70s and early 80s."
5,Old book still valid,"In the seventies I first came into contact with the book True Spirituality, and a recent reread convinced me that it still gives a clear message concerning the self-less life of a Christian. With the world clamouring at the door the average Christian can use Schaeffer's compelling arguments for a return to a relationship driven faith. I would encourage anyone interested in access to the ""deeper life"" to consider what Schaeffer has written."
4,inspirational and very true!,"""When God turns inward to Himself, he is a Trinity, but when when we turn inward, there is no one there to answer...This not only causes psychological problems, but it also destroys my relationship with others. ""People without God... hang too much on their personal relationships, and they crush and break.No love affair between a man and a woman has ever been great enough to hang everything on. It will crumble away under your feet...""""If I acknowledge that I am really not God, and that since the fall we are all sinful, then I can have true human relationships without battering myself to pieces because they are not sufficient in themselves, or because they are not perfect."" Shaeffer, TS 344, 345"
5,Getting Back to the Basics,"Of all of the religious books I have read about the Christian faith, this by far, has been the most refreshing! It takes the believer back to the basics, back to their first love. The author reestablishes for himself as much as for the reader what true unadulterated Christianity should really be about. He strips away the imprisonment of ""works"" and restores the freedom to worship and love the Lord without fear of condemnation or the heavy burden of guilt. It is a pleasant book to read and I recommend it for anyone, whether a believer or not!"
1,Emergency Undelete DOES NOT WORK!,"Bookmstr's review is totally on the mark, except in my case it didn't find ANY files. Other programs at least saw all of my accidentally deleted files. This program showed me nothing. I even deleted a file and immediately tested it and it wouldn't find the file."
1,Leaves black marks on the countertop.,I bought this because I already had a glass jar from my old blender.This blender has lasted over a year but I can't stand the black marks it leaves all over the countertop any more. I'm throwing it out inspite of the fact that it is still working.
2,Great Wire Jewelry,Very disappointing! Instructions incomplete or difficult to understand. Illustrations are not that much help and at least one appears to have an error (pg. 42) Save your money and get better instructions on the internet for free.
1,"Should be Called: Jump Rings, Finish Yourself","I bought the book because of the reviews.However All the projects in this little book are in less then 58 PAGES and the book has ONLY 60 PAGES.There are some braiding, and more then HALF of The Book are Chain Mail/Jump Rings.So, The book should be called Chain Mail without the Finish touches or Jump Rings Finish yourself.If I wanted book on Jump Rings I would have bought a Jump Rings/Chain Mail book and not a ""wire"" book as its is showing on the cover.I thought I was going to find some gorgeous wire work (finished pieces) which did not happened.ALL the projects are UNFINISHED which is a terrible thing for you to buy a book that does not teach you how to finish the piece, and the so called ""explanations"" are drawings, and not Step By Step Pictures; Which is annoying.There are no many arrows showing where to go with the ""wire"" and where its coming from; REALLY CONFUSING.The book IS NOT As Shown on the Cover.Waste of Money & Time.Don't Waste Yours."
3,Great projects,I haven't tried any of the projects yet but the directions seem easy to follow. I'm sure ill try some soon.
3,Not so good a fighting game,"At first the gameplay is nice, but it soon gets boring and reptitive. the cutscene graphics suck!!!! for me, the game's only saving graces are the characters and the tag mode."
2,Terrible GBA Game,This game has levels that you do the same thing all over. The challanging mode is not great. The only thing that is great is the characters. I cannot wait to check out the PC version
3,Too Hard to Install,"It's very hard to insert the glass into the holder. If you follow the instruction by direct front push-in, it's impossible. Our bathroom contractor therefore gave up and left it to me. I tried pushing it in from the side, with literally all of my strength, and finally did it. I think it'll be super firm and secured, but it still has a maybe 5 - 10 degree free play. Its 8"" width is very wide - too wide. It's ideal for wall shelf in the bathroom for towels, clothes, etc. If you put it in the bath tub, front under the shower is probably the only place to fit. We had to put it in the back, fortunately just barely fit."
4,Pleased with this shelf,"I purchased two of these shelves to fit in an art nook to hold my small collectible figurines. They fit perfectly, and are a beautiful addition to my home. I would buy more of these shelves for other locations in my home. They would also be good for accessory shelves in the bathroom."
1,anti icky poo starter kit,Product does not work. SAVE YOUR MONEY!I really wanted this product to work. Unfortunately..like others before..this product is no different. Waste of my time and money. The stain remover did not work AT ALL either.I guess nothing works on cat urine!
1,It doesn't work,"I purchased the product based on the high reviews it had gotten. I followed the instructions to the last letter hoping to be rid of the urine smell. However, after hours of cleaning and to my dismay, I realized that the smell was still very potent and my cat went right back to the spot to urinate. I wasted my money for nothing."
1,Anti Icky Poo,"After spending almost $100 for this product and hoping that it would work as stated, I was very disappointed. I followed the instructions to the letter, even steam cleaning my carpet, but the stain remover and the odor remover didn't work. It DID temporarily remove the odor but the next day it was back. It didn't remove even a small amount of the stain nor did it totally remove the odor. Am very disappointed."
4,great purchase.,"great quality bench. perfect for lifting in the comfort and privacy of your home. many ways to adjust, great value and would recommend to anyone!"
4,A Great Primer on late Victorian and Edwardian Society,"""Secrets of the Manor House"" hops on the Downton Abbey train with a detailed look at life both upstairs and downstairs during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The stunning houses featured are enough to convince those well-versed in the period (like me!) to add this to one's DVD collection, and for those new to the period, the documentary is a great visual intro to Edwardian social history. This is an excellent companion toThe World of Downton Abbey, and is likely to whet one's appetite for more Edwardiana!"
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to a very different type of approach to the secrets of the manor houses - a bit more of the actual historical secrets, of which I'm sure there are many. To me, it felt mostly like a criticism of the way of life of the Edwardian society. Totally different from the ""Treasure Houses of Britain"" which takes you on tours of these wonderful historical houses and takes the time to show you the treasures in each one of them. Not my cup of tea!!"
4,"Good complement to ""Downton Abbey""","Lots of background to help your appreciation of any ""English Country House"" movies or television shows. It's fun and well done."
1,Universal fit? In what universe?,"This rotisserie is labeled and boxed Charbroil. One would figure that it would be a good fit for a Charbroil BBQ. It is not. I had to tweak the brackets and drill two additional holes into the BBQ side firewall to make them fit right. If I used the pre-drilled holes, the lid would not close. And forget about opening the side burner lid. The bracket gets in the way. I had to pound the bracket flat in order to make clearance for the side burner lid to open.Now after some unnecessary adjustments, everything worked out ok.Cheap plastic motor housing. Hopefully it lasts during this summer.Buy Cheap, you get Cheap!"
1,Poor performer,"I waited 2 weeks for this to come to Lowes after ordering it, and the first time I used it, it turned a 5lb pork tenderloin for 2 hours before it began to stop turning. I was busy doing something while the meat was turning, and when I looked at it, it wasn't turning. A most excellent product. For what I don't know. I would nudge the handle and it turned for a few times, then stopped again. I did this numerous times. Not a good experience!And it made alot of noises. It seemed very under powered!"
2,Not Really Universal,"If you want to use it with the grill cover open, then this rotisserie is ok.If you want to use it with the cover closed, you will have problems with some grills.The mounting brackets do not provide enough holes to mount them at the right height.The handle is too big and thick and will touch the side shelf of some grills"
1,Horribly weak motor. Don't buy it!,"The electric motor that came with this item is worthless. It wouldn't turn a 4 pound chicken without stopping. This is after the chicken was ""balanced"" and the entire unit leveled, etc.per the instructions. What a piece of junk. I'm returning it and buying a quality product."
2,Poor design across the board,"This thing is so badly designed it must have been created by committee.The spitrod doesn't insert far enough into the motor.The thumbscrews are way too small.The brackets are beyond a joke and do not properly fit most CharBroil grills. There are no holes on the motor end to allow a proper level fit.The lid on your grill will probably have to be propped slightly open to avoid fouling the spit.The brackets are weak and bend on the motor end when the spit is in place (part of the reason the rod falls out).When using this, you'll need to be in attendance the whole time to make sure nothing falls apart.Given that Charbroil make this themselves, you'd think they could manage to design it so that it at least fit theirs."
2,Currently Unknown Opinion,The motor failed. A replacement unit was promptly sent and in a professional manner. The failed part was returned and should arrive by july 10th. Along with the part was a detailed failure report. The replacement part has not been tested and the response to the failure report is currently unavailable.The customer test may not proceed until a response from the failure report validating the assembly in available.
3,Finally perfection,"While the unit may or may not be ""universal"", it was easy to attach to my charbroil grill.As you may have read with others, the first motor would quit after about an hour. Second motor (same type) failed after about 1/2 hour. Third motor (different type, plastic instead of all metal) was great. Tested all different types of food and ended up cooking a 13 lb turkey, with stuffing. It turned for over four hours and was most excellent. While it took some hassle and some time, they finally made it right. I was out $6.45 extra for shipping/"
3,universal?,"As stated previously, ""universal"" it aint. But after modifying the motor bracket, I was able to grill a pork tenderloin to perfection. Had been trying for over three months to get one from Char-Broil but their customer service is a no-star. Finally decided to go with Amazon and I had it in one week. Took about an hour to modify and level it and the results were outstanding."
2,disappointed,"The moror is suprisingly weak, did not think it was going to last until i was done with it the first time i used it. Also the brackets it rides on are really flimsy."
1,Not Universal,"Save your money if you're buying this to pair with a Weber Genesis Silver gas grill. There are no holes on the right side of the grill to attach one of the Charbroil brackets. Since there are grooves on the right side of the grill, you might think you can merely lay the bar into the existing groove. Unfortunately, none of the brackets that come with the rotiserie, that must be used to hold the motor, let the motor sit low enough to line up with the opposite groove. I suppose one could jury rig something to make it work. I returned mine and bought a Weber product."
3,Good old classic,"Operation Flashpoint is a classic shooter, imaginative gameplay and style make it a timeless classic. the graphics do leave quite a lot to be desired, even for 10 years ago. It also is very glitchy and buggy. However if you look past that it creates a very real and tense atmosphere."
2,Does NOT fit all 2 1/2 qt pans,Does not fit Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized Collector's Edition 2 1/2-Quart Shallow Saucepan with Lid
2,Nice product but doesn't fit as advertised,"I bought this double boiler specifically for my 2 1/2qt Calphalon Professional Saucepan thinking it would fit together nicely as it was advertised ""fits all Calphalon Professional and Commercial 2 1/2qt saucepans"". Wrong. Not only is there a decent sized gap around the edges where the double boiler pan should snuggly meet the saucepan, but the bottom of the double boiler sits directly on the bottom of the saucepan, not allowing for any water barrier, and essentially, defeating the purpose of using a double boiler. I'm very disappointed. The product itself is well made and feels quite durable and sturdy but it was mismatched with my saucepan. I mistakenly threw out the packaging before realizing this and am now unable to return it....anyone need a double boiler pan and want to take a gamble that it will fit your saucepan?!"
5,Gift,It was gift for my son-in-law. It's exactly what he had on his list and he seemed quite pleased with the item.
5,One of the 2 first excellant Mother Earth albums,"My personal favorite on this album is ""You Win Again,"" and she can still sing like that. This is full of good ones, besides that. Just slightly not as great as the first one by them, but it's close enough to be called great."
4,How we bring things on ourselves,"This is an excellent book. The author, a medical doctor, through easy to understand charts and graphs, explains how most of the patients he sees could have prevented, or lessened the effects, of their illness. The author also recommends simple cost-effective strategies for taking better care of ourselves. The book is written from a Christian perspective."
4,Very good book,"This book was required reading for one of my courses in Christian Ministries; however, I'm glad it was required. The book helps you to take a closer look at your time management. Everyone of my classmates found that they were overloaded. Thought this book was read by my Christian Ministries class, I would recommend it to any adult out there. Time is such a precious thing and too often it seems that we are not able to find time to rest, to truly rest. This book helps put things in perspective so that you can restore the margin in your own life."
2,Review of Restoring Margin of Overload,"I purchased this book as a supplemental book in a Bible study. I did not buy it because I wanted to read it, but it just doesn't apply to me at this stage of my life of retirement. I can see that it might have been useful much earlier in my life when I was raising children and working."

3,DISAPPOINTED,"IT IS VASTLY OVER ORICED FOR WHAT IT IS, I AM SURE THE QUALITY OF THIS OJNE WILL NOT BE ANY BETTER THAN THE LAST. IT IS OK, JUSTG TINK IT IT TOO HIGH."
4,Replacement,"Bought 3 pitchers this time simply because they continue to break/separate at the seam by the spout - we drink a lot of home brewed tea. One of the few places they can be found, very easy to order, and replacements arrived quickly. Decent price per unit, especially due to free shipping."
3,works,Works just as the first one. I think they should have designed these to last so I wouldn't have to get a replacement. This one will wear out just as the last one did.
5,happy happy,"Merry CHRISTmas to me! How sad is it that I bought myself a pitcher for CHRISTmas and I am sooooo happy about it! I can finally make ice tea in a snap like I used to before my other 2 pitchers broke. Goodbye boiling water and soaking teabags and waiting... Like other reviewers said, they had the same problem of the front seam splitting but the tea maker itself still works great! the price at amazon beats the online store, S/H was more than pitcher. I will be stocking up on the bundle deal after I recoup from CHRISTtmas!"
1,Don't buy these pitchers,"I bought an extra pitcher with my iced tea maker and both of them cracked along the front seam in precisely the same area. Manufacturing flaw, I don't even have a dishwasher."
3,Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Replacement Pitcher 3 Qrt,"I have had to order two replacements as the first one cracked when filling with ice from an ice dispenser on outside of refrigerator door. Obviously, the plastic/material the pitcher is made out of can't with stand much ""pushing"" on it's side. Ordered second replacement, so far it hasn't cracked, but I now fill it with the ""pushing"" closer to the pour spout. To prevent cracking, I suggest filling with ice from another container, rather than directly filling from dispenser on outside of refrigerator door. It's a great product, just needs to be made out of a more durable material. I give it 3 stars due to this."
1,Poor Quality,"The pitcher is made from poor quality materials. We have two pitchers and have never washed them in the dishwasher. In less than a year, both pitchers cracked along the seam that runs from the spout down the side of the pitcher. If we attempt to use them, tea immediately leaks all over the counter. Since other pitchers are not compatible with the machine, our ice tea maker is useless. We have owned two previous Mr. Coffee Ice Tea models in the past ten years. The pitchers lasted for several years before eventually cracking. Mr. Coffee chose to use inferior materials with this model. I am very disappointed in the quality and will never trust their company again. I am now searching for an ice tea maker that uses quality materials."
1,Mr. Coffee TP-3 Ice Tea Pitcher,This is my second order for four of these items in the last two years. All of the tea pots keep separating at the spout seam after a few months of use. This is an obvious manufacturing defect of the tea pot and detracts from a very useful product. The saving grace is that you do not have to replace the whole unit each time because Mr. Coffee sells replacement pitchers.
3,Tea pitcher.,"This makes ten of these pitchers I have bought. I buy them because they fit my tea maker, not because they are good. The seam that is right where the hot tea trickles down gives way and they leak. I like the shape and size, but they are faulty in structure."
2,Cracked after 10 mos. use,"Need the ""big"" (3q)size (and like to be able to ""hold"" the hot water in the tea leaf holder to increase brew strength...which you can do with this design, as with the 2Q), so ordered a replacement....but, 10 mos of gentle use is not enough. Cant tell if this replacement pitcher is a different material or not....if I get motivated, may write the company (I have the 2qt version and it has lasted for years without cracking). Spout will crack with limited use, per other users."
2,I'LL TAKE MY TEA WITHOUT PLASTIC PLEASE!,"I must have had a senior moment when I purchased this item as this and the plastic coffeemakers are now collecting dust in my basement. If I have a choice, I choose not to have BPA and Polymer in my food and beverages. I thought about the entire process of piping hot water running through a plastic basket then sitting in a plastic pitcher, for days. I purchased a stainless steel percolator and make tea the old fashioned way with boiling water and use a glass pitcher."
1,my friend sucks,it was not even the right size for the ice tea maker !!!!!!!!!!!!!! my friend gave me a tea maker and she could not find the tea pitcher and so i ordered one that was all wrong
4,Better Price,"For those of you not happy with the price of this item, the pitcher is only $8.99 at the Mr. Coffee Store online."
2,Help me I'm melting!,"Ahhh.... I love making iced tea this way, but the pitcher keeps melting/warping in the dishwasher! My first pitcher that came with the maker lasted several years before it cracked from overuse, but this is my 4th pitcher this summer! I will continue buying the pitchers, however, because my iced tea turns out so well with this machine."
1,ice tea maker,The Mr. Coffe Ice Tea maker is a piece of junk. The design of the pitcher fitting into the brewing part dosen't work. If the basket that holds the tea bags is the least bit stained or dirty it will run all over the counter. The pitcher should fit underneath the dripper in the middle of the brewer. The pitcher should have a hole in the middle of the top so the water drips in the center of the top and not down the spout. I have to stand right there while it is brewing to watch it.I have to clean it about every time I use it with clorax to keep the hole open
1,Dissappointed customer,I recently ordered a replacement pitcher. I ordered the wrong pitcher. I have e-mailed them twice and have yet to hear from them. Now I am stuck with a pitcher and now have to find the right one. It was my firsttime doing business with them and now my last.
2,Oh so fragile,My husband and I received our Iced Tea Maker as a wedding gift and it came with two pitchers. The pitchers are terribly fragile and unfortunately not dishwasher safe. The first pitcher broke about a year later and I moved on to the second one and eventually it broke too. I looked at other brands of tea makers but found myself sentimentally attached to this tea maker as it was a wedding gift and decided to replace the pitcher and see how long I can keep this tea maker going. The tea maker itself works fine and is far and beyond the most used small appliance in my kitchen. I will probably just keep replacing pitchers as needed (and storing them in the box they come in for extra protection) but when the tea maker ever quits I will explore other tea maker options and look for one that has a stronger pitcher.
3,Pitchers Do Split,"I bought the Mr. Coffee Tea Maker because I'm a serious iced tea drinker. It uses a LOT of ice from my icemaker (keeps the ice fresh) and works like a champ. The tea does leak from the spout when you're making it so seating the spout securely is essential. After a year of use, the spouts on the two pitchers started to split. I retired them from the tea maker and now use them to brew tea by throwing three family size Luzianne bags in the pitcher and pouring a tea kettle full of boiling water right over the bags. Leak problem solved. It's just as fast as the tea maker and makes the tea just fine--I leave the bags in because the tea doesn't last that long. I actually have another tea pitcher of much better plastic that I use more (I think it was Bodum) and that pitcher is my primary."
3,Mr Coffee Replacement Iced Tea pitcher,"Received the machine for Christmas and cracked the pitcher the first day! When put in the refrigerator I must not have allowed enough room for the handle and when I closed the door the pitcher cracked. Love the machine - makes great tea very quickly. Anyway, learned my lesson - watch the handle. Would have liked the pitcher to be less brittle. I ordered three replacement pitchers. (Was actually cheaper to order three than to order two and pay postage - you know, woman's logic) Should get me through for awhile. If I can't get it right after three I shouldn't be using electric appliances anyway!"
4,Wish I didn't have to buy this,"My first iced tea carafe also split on the seam near the pour spout. It makes sense, that it would happen where all the boiling hot water gets dripped. The only thing I wanted to add about my purchase is that, while the pitcher is cheaper on the Mr. Coffee site, they wanted to charge $9 for shipping and handling. Since I have amazon prime, it was more effective to buy it from amazon. Also, I tried the aluminum foil idea from an earlier review--brilliant! Hopefully I won't have to buy another one."
1,Glad to see I'm not alone!,"This is our 2nd Mr.Coffee Iced Tea Maker and - I am not sure how many pitchers we have used? Maybe this was the 4th? The problem is we love the tea - not just the convenience, but we love the tea! Since Mr. Coffee isn't going to change their obviously flawed product, we are glad we don't have to replace the whole unit every time the pitcher cracks! And I will confess.... after the first 3, I DO occasionally put it in the dishwasher. (It's going to crack anyway! Might as well be really clean when it does!). Glad we can come here to get another one....."
2,Not quite what I'd expected.,"When I ordered this product, I thought it would fit my Mr. Coffee Iced Tea maker correctly, but it does not. While I did not read all of the reviews, those that I did suggested that it would match my model number. Currently, I use the original cracked pitcher to make the tea, and immediately transfer it into this one that fits better on my refrigerator."
3,Overpriced MR. Coffee ice tea pitcher,"This pitcher works fine for awhile. Being brittle plastic, however, it deteriorates too quickly, with leaking cracks the norm after a few months' use. It's overpriced, but sized and shaped correctly for the iced tea maker. A bit more pliable plastic would be better. We've taken to using this pitcher to make the iced tea, then dumping the tea into a slightly larger, more durable, more pliable, less expensive pitcher for storage and serving."
3,crackes and dribbles,"I purchased this tea maker and was completely satisfied with it's performance for 6 months until it began to dribble. It has a brewing dial and after the desired strength is reached, you open a valve to let the tea enter the pitcher. Suddenly it began to dribble outside of the pitcher and stain the countertop, creating a mess to clean up. Then, while washing the pitcher, it cracked on the seam under the spout. I am buying a replacement so I can continue to use the brewer. I still have to find the reason for the dribble. I LOVE the tea I make in this, but I wish these two problems had not developed."
1,Find another brand,"This pitcher will suffer that same fate as it's replacement. You can see the molding lines that run down the front of the plastic. It is a manufacturing defect, and I can't believe Mr. Coffee still sells the same garbage. I only bought another one, as the machine itself makes great tea.They should give these things away."
2,Wish it lasted longer...,"I bought a replacement pot for my last pot, because it had cracked. This will be my third pot, and I bought two. The tea pot brews great tea, but unfortunately, the pots don't hold up. Wish they would make them more durable!"
3,Pitcher breaks easily!,"I love my Iced Tea Pot! But, the pitcher broke today when it fell off my counter top. I just got it this past summer, too. Thank goodness I do have a spare one until I can get another pitcher. The reviewer before me said the pitcher melts in the dishwasher, but the pitcher clearly says on it ""NOT DISHWASHER SAFE"". I'd suggest not putting it in the dishwasher!"
2,Mr. Coffee Iced tea replacement pitcher,"I love my Mr. Coffee Ice Tea Maker but hate that the unit itself always outlasts the plastic pitchers. This is the third one I have had. It does (so far) seem to be a little better made than the last one but it may still split and crack. The original pitchers from years ago could be put in the top of the dishwasher; not these!! I have read that the change in temperature from hot to cold is what causes a lot of problems but do not understand why the pitchers cannot be made with this in mind. They are also expensive to replace. A few more dollars and you could get an entire new unit. However, the newer ones are shorter and do not hold as much. I like the size and content of the TP3. As of now, I am content with the new pitcher but in a few months I will see just how well it holds up."
3,Cracks over time.,"You really have to baby these pitchers. The seam that runs down the front of the pitcher will usually crack over time. I've cracked two. It helps to fill the pitcher with hot water instead of iced water, and then put it in the fridge after brewing. I found that the quick temperature change is too much for these pitchers, and causes them to eventually split on the seam.Also, do not push the top sideways down into the pitcher. The pitcher feels flexible, but that can cause it to crack as well. They should either start making these out of a more durable material, or reinforce that seam somehow."
3,My pitcher melted!,"I love the iced tea maker! I bought mine about 5 or 6 years ago, and it came with 2 pitchers... One of the pitchers broke during moving, but before it did (i only used one at a time) the pour spout started to warp and melt a little from frequent use and the tea stained the plastic, no matter what i used to wash it with.. The plastic also scratches easily and looks really dingy. I'm now using the 2nd pitcher, and i've been using it longer than the first... the same stratching and melting has occured, and now the pour spout is VERY disfigured, it barely fits in the slot for the maker and its cracking so it's difficult to pour the tea.. The actual unit still works great, i've never had any type of problem, but I really would like to buy 2 replacements so I can have extra tea... I dont know if I should suck it up and just buy a newer model though, i'd hate to keep having the same problems with these pitchers.."
1,Good Tea Maker Bad Pitcher,"We have had four of these tea makers and they are the best we have ever had. THE PROBLEM: Without fail, each pitcher started leaking with about 6 months use. Don't know why they can't manufacture a pitcher that doesn't leak all over the counter and the ice box. Great tea maker BUT .........................."
2,New replacement iced tea pitchers,"I have had a Mr. Coffee iced tea pot for 9 years. I use it daily and LOVE IT! However, this past year I have ordered 3 new replacement pitchers. The first one my son was replacing the lid after washing it in the dishwasher and it didn't fit, so as any good teenager would do, he forced it, cracking the pitcher. I never really looked to see what caused it to break. I ordered another replacement pitcher and added one more just to have a backup. They arrived today and I put one new one in the dishwasher and it warped. These new light blue topped pitchers CANNOT be put in the dishwasher. They warp and the lids no longer fit. I am glad I ordered two. My original pitcher is wash every 3-4 days (we drink a lot of tea) and it has never warped. So BEWARE of the newer plastic pitcher. Wash them by hand. I am glad I ordered two new ones this month. Mr. Coffee needs to address this issue."
5,Love them,"These are the replacements pitchers for the 1st model of the Mr. Coffee tea maker. Now if I could only find an original 3qt tea maker. Mine still works but it is old. I have used the new 3qt model and don't like it nearly as much, wife feels the same. It seems that when you have perfection you would leave it alone."
2,"Terrible textbook - barely any examples, disorganized","As another reviewer mentioned, this book seems like it's a good reference, but it is the worst book to learn from. There are barely any problems with worked out solutions. Moreover, the writing is disorganized - as the content is being developed, equations from all over the book are referred to. Figures from other pages are constantly referred to within the text, which makes it difficult to focus on the material in between page flips. If this is a required textbook for your class, definitely buy a supplemental textbook that has worked examples. You're going to have a hard time learning from this book."
4,solution manaul,This is a very good book in this vital area of physics and eng.Therefore i have recomended this book to be taught this year to my students.I shall be grateful if you can send me the solution manaul and any other related material availaible electronically.best regards.saleh.
3,Exhaustive but verbose,"The book is divided into three parts, one covering general topics in optics, second part lasers and third part, brief discussion of assorted topics.The book is exhaustive and verbose. As a first book on photonics I would not recommend it. The information on lasers is enormous but the language fails to convey good understanding.The problems in the book are tough and without an answer key, it would be difficult to glean any understanding from it.However it is a useful reference book to have and and I would recommend using it wisely alongwith other material."
4,"A textbook, but a really good textbook.","I like this book. I really do, but I'm a nerd. It's very, very dense. it reads like a long research paper on text-adventure games. But that's because it basically is a research paper on text adventures. However if you like a serious approach to the history of gaming then this book is a great pick up and read. If you're looking for some light techno-babble about how awesome video games are, it's not this. This is not so much a beach read, but it's an interesting experience."
4,Excellent and Intelligent,Loved this book and sorry to have started late in the series. Will catch up real soon. This book kept me up late at night - a sure sign of a good read! Relationship was very intense and you never knew where it was going for long. Barbara Parker is on my reading list for sure now!
5,Hellmaster,The things I liked most about this movie was Saxon's creepy performance and the setting--it was filmed in rural Michigan that reminded me of where Raimi filmed the Evil Dead series. There is enough suspense and atmosphere to keep a good horror fan glued to the TV set.
5,REALLY FUNNY MY TEACHER WAS IN IT,"The best part is when a teacher...Reithmiller, gets eaten by a evil nun. rent it and watch it and laugh at the utterly hillarious."
4,Works great for calming a baby in a car seat,I used this for a motion feeling for my son in the car seat when we are in traffic or going through streets with lots of stop lights. He wants constant motion. The only problem is the batteries vibrate out of place and it stops until you open it to reset the batteries. I had to put something in the battery case to make it a tighter fit.
5,Track cutters,"Found this because I had some rail road tracks to cut, ended up buying a totalof 4 for my work and ham radio hobby, they are the best wire cutters forsmall wire, i have ever found in over 50 years. Loved these guys"
1,"Come to the point, already","I can't help but compare this book to the books of the mistress of the British murder mystery, Dame Agatha Christie. Agatha Christie could write a book with a good, tight plot that could keep you guessing to the very end without being 400+ pages long. I'm all for a good read, but I don't have to have the life's story of each character and know every passing mood or thought. This, to me, was character development at its most mind-numbingly boring pace. And I don't like Lynley. For a person who supposedly despises being reminded that he's an aristocrat, he certainly has some superior and condescending attitudes. Not a very matey fellow, our posh Lynley. I wanted to kick him in the arse."
3,"Good, not great","This is the 4th or 5th Elizabeth George mystery I've read. It's good (she writes beautifully) but did not hold my attention as much as two previous works, ""Deception On His Mind"" and ""In The Presence of the Enemy"". As always, she keeps you guessing until the very end (I've never figured out who the culprit is before it's revealed!) and her descriptions are so exact you can visualize settings and people. Yet, I found this book a tad too long, too drawn out. I haven't given up on Ms. George and eagerly await the next novel."
4,A Very Dark Tale,"Five stars for the writing and the research, this very dark tale is beautifully composed. What begins at a genteel and well bred pace, slowly tunnels into the very darkest places and emotions, and made the journey virtually endless. Lynley and Havers (and Winnie) take the reader into the world of Scotland Yard and the most unsavory characters (including those you might least expect). The writing is impressive, the characterization is excellent, and the reader is placed right in the midst of the investigation. But all in all the story is devoid of hope -- very, very dark. Not having previously read any of Ms. George's book, I think I'll stop here, for it was a bit too realistic for me."
3,"I felt like I plodded through this one, too dark.",I was disappointed with this book. There were too many pathetic characters with no real point. I wish she would go a little easier on Havers and I'mtired of all the emotional baggage with Lynley.
2,Main characters growing stale,"While Ms. George continues to charm the eye and mind with her command of the language, I am heartily sick of Lynley, Helen and Havers. I would LOVE to read a whole novel about Simon and Deborah. Have they worked out their problems about the repeated miscarriages? Does his disability cause personal problems in their marriage? What's it like to have your father-in- law live in as well as be your 'serant'? Lots of areas to explore and give Lynley and Havers' angst a rest."
4,Potentially five stars,"A potential five star mystery spoilt by the lingering feeling that there will be a vocabulary test on the last few pages.This is the first Elizabeth George I've read and it's a really very good storey. Great plot, great intrigue, great mystery, great finish and well researched. However I'm not a great believer in entertaining novels like this being the place for an author to hugely demonstrate ones superior grasp of vocabulary.Maybe the words used are common in Jolly Olde England but a more International approach to vocabulary would make this a less grating experience.That said, it was still good enough for me to try one more."
3,First time with Elizabeth George's work was a fine time,"I've never read any other of George's books and was given this by a colleague who thought I might appreciate a good mystery with a positive spin on SM. I'm not sure this is strictly a mystery -- its more a cop drama really and I suspect the characters are ones that George has used previously. As for the positive SM, is it positive if the lead detective is constantly thinking how sick all these people are or how much drug or alcohol use is shown or how alligned it is with prostitution? Didn't seem particularly positive to me but maybe things are quite different in England. It is a very English book -- so if British language and terms throw you, you'll have difficulty following this. I, too, got a bit tired of following one character, a female detective who's off the case really, and the two male detectives around separately but if you've seen these characters before it may be more interesting to you."
3,In Pursuit of Better Writing,"On page 413, I'm forcing myself to finish this book. As usual George develops a complicated, many-faceted plot. She has four members of the CID (Lynley, Nkata, Havers, and a Derbyshire detective) going off in four different directions, each following different leads. There are so many trails that it's confusing, much more than the reader can take.The plots and surprises carry the book, but, unfortunately, if you slow down and notice, the writing is poor. And George's penchant for throwing in unheard-of words is like being lulled by a Sunday stroll and then tripping over a rock.As usual in her books, she insists on involving themes of sex and its extremes. And the language of some of the characters is often crude and slangy, with the possible exception of the well-educated Lynley. But even he uses an occasional ""suss out.""If I were a Brit, I'd be upset with George's character portrayals: Everyone has a problem and is basically unlikable and weak."
2,About 200 pages too long...,"Having read all the previous George mysteries, I was looking forward to this one. By the time I got about halfway through, however, it became exceeding drawn out and boring. The author could have easily cut the novel by about 200 pages and still had an enjoyable mystery. There were too many minor characters that the detectives were always visiting. By the end of the book I didn't even care who did it, I just wanted the thing to be over!"
2,So unneccesarily complicated! My head is spinning...,"I am a big Elizabeth George fan, but this was just to convuluted a plot with characters I couldn't care less about. So much suffering and angst and so many loose ends. And WHY is George so down on Havers? Too many characters, too contrived a plot, nasty overtones and undercurrents. Yuck.... I'm hoping the next one is better."
5,Superb !!!,"The two-year wait was worth it: this book is almost relentlessly perfect.Ms. George always chooses complex themes and in this novel she focuses on the aloneness of self and the essential unknowability of others. ""In Pursuit"" roams deeply and widely through the effects of this aloneness/unknowingness on our lives, loves, relationships, and - of course - our deaths.George has created interesting new characters, as she always does, to support her theme, but the familiar ones are present too, though slightly less knowable than usual. Again, a deft touch on the part of Elizabeth George.If there were a ten-star catagory ""In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner"" would definitely carry the banner."
3,Keeps your interest but disappointing. . .,"This is my first EG novel. My attention was definitely kept throughout and I enjoyed her command of the English language. It's silly to criticize an author for using a large vocabulary .... I loved her portrayal of the English moors and her mood setting. However, I agree with some of the other readers that the plot lacked-it was just too obvious! It would have been much more interesting had someone else been the murderer. Her excessive characters were also annoying such as her neighbor, Lynley's hackneyed attitude toward women, and the foolishness of Havers. I could have certainly done without the sex scenes and general immorality rampant in the novel. Mistakes happen but let's not glorify them ...."
3,Only fair,"I really looked forward to this book; after ""Deception on His Mind"" I thought that I'd finally turn into an Elizabeth George fan. Unfortunately, this was not the case, but I did realize why I never quite finish her books. ""Deception on his Mind"" focused on Barbara Havers, who is much more interesting than Thomas Lynley and his dullsville aristocratic pals. The best parts of ""In Pursuit"" are the ones that feature disheveled, undiplomatic, smart-as-hell Havers, who operates purely on her instincts, and who's in the doghouse for events in ""Deception."" Even her adored Lynley thinks she was in the wrong, and Barbara will do anything to regain his trust.E. George writes well and plots like nobody's business. The scenes in London's S/M underworld are great, especially when Havers or fellow-cop Winston Nkata are involved. I hope that George focuses her next book on them. Lynley and his turgid marital problems put me to sleep."
4,Involved but grabs you!,"As I don't read mysteries as a rule,I wasn't aware that this was part of a long series and went into it with an open mind. It sets a cracking pace and involves you with the protagonists immediately.Set in the moors with a double murder at a henge,which adds to the strangeness of the case,the writer weaves a plot full of red herrings and which grips the reader at once. Unfortunately,the plot becomes very convoluted while still remaining fascinating,which means that your brain works overtime,trying to keep up! I DID enjoy it as a change of pace,but think that I'll need a bit of fluffy nonsense to slow down with next!!"
4,confusing plot,"It is difficult to classify exactly why George's books are so compelling but I will have a go. The murder plot was not particularly interesting and a little tedious to follow - I won't spoil it for anyone but the identity of the murderer is a little contrived.Simply said, George writes terrific fiction and it is fiction, despite what some say about her right on observation of English life. I have lived in the UK for 30 years and can tell all you Anglophiles right now that George's England does not exist.It's true to say that none of her characters are interesting people, Lynley in particular is downright two dimensional ... yet somehow she provides a magical concoction that, when shaken together is richly satisfying, and a wonderful escapist read."
3,It Never Ends,"I considered giving this book more stars, since the quality of the writing is superb. It's a real pleasure to just enjoy that aspect of Ms. George's work. Despite this high level, however, it is not enough to make the journey worthwhile. There was a point, about 2/3 of the way through, that I just wanted the book to be finished.Perhaps Ms. George enjoys the writing a little too much in relation to the story, thus the length? If you're more patient than I, you will enjoy her work."
2,Sodding Tiresome,"I give this book two stars only because it captured my attention enough to beguile me into reading it through to the end. At that point, I wondered why I'd wasted the time. Too long by at least 100 pages, this pretentious Elizabeth George effort starts with a bang and ends with a whimper from the reader who suffers from overexposure to too many extraneous characters doing way too little for way too long and mouthing way too much UK slang in the process. Sodding tiresome if you ask me. When I finally found out who did what to whom, I was less satisfied with the outcome than grateful that it was finally over. Ho hum."
2,Missed the mark,"Granted, this was my first Elizabeth George book ever, so I was unaware that Lynley and Havers, et al had a history. I found them to be overly tedious; the book overly populated with characters, many of whom were unnecessary; and the whole thing overly long and overly confusing. Three hundred fifty pages would have been plenty! And I too found Nicola's depraved personality to be simply without foundation and totally implausible. Too bad, Ms. George. Your one chance to impress me and you blew it."
2,I was in pursuit of finishing this heavy paperweight!,"I guess I picked the wrong book to start reading Elizabeth George. I did find the characters interesting and wanted to know more about them, but it went on and on and on..... I continued reading because I was intrigued by the plot, but found it difficult to read more than a chapter at a sitting. I finally gave up about 100 pages from the end, and sneaked a look at the ending. I hate doing that, BUT I COULDN'T TAKE ANYMORE! Ms. George could save herself alot of time and effort if in her next book she condensed the plot by half. I can't imagine who would have the patience to read this thing in a reasonable period of time."
4,Another brilliant exercise but ...,"I recently finished Elizabeth George's latest Lynley (now Lynley-Havers) book and found it riveting. But I fail to understand (and don't appreciate) the author's decision to make Havers so terribly unattractive, fat, sloppy and intent on intensifying her obsessions with smoking and eating fat.George has clearly decided to make HER female character different from all the others and I imagine she thinks it is amusing, or gets a charge out of being deliberately politically incorrect. Fine. But the emphasis is such that at least this reader is beginning to find some of her discriptions downright distasteful. I hope the author will cool it in the future and concentrate on what she does so well, weaving one or more tales into a fascinating plot and peopling them with intriguing, interesting and at times unfathomable characters."
2,Bored me long before the end was in sight,"This book has convinced me that I don't like Elizabeth George. Long before the end could be seen, I was thoroughly sick of the ""victim"", the detectives, the bystanders and even the English countryside. There is far too much here of Lynley's and Havers' whining about their personal problems; far too much irrelevent detail about the S&M underworld; far too much pseudo-Brit slang. It doesn't ring true to me- maybe because I read this directly after the far superior ""River of Darkness"" and ""The Masters of the House"" (again). So many scenes had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and so many threads were left hanging after the denouement. This will definitely be the last of this series for me."
1,And one star is a stretch.,"I have enjoyed her other books immensely, but I really had to struggle to get to page 33. . .I gave up then. This one is a big disappointment."
3,not one of her best,"In this book, Detective Barbara Havers is facing disciplinaryaction for saving her neighbor's daughter from drowning in the previous book. Her partner Lynley does not take her side (unlike the TV version, where he saves the child) until the very end which makes for tension between them.Two bodies are found near each other in the countryside, and the detectives try to link the two together. What they find leads them to a prostitution ring, in which the daughter of Lynley's mentor may be invovled. Also in the mix is a son who is bitter over being leftPersonally, I would like to see more of Barbara's interaction with her Pakistani neighbors. Compared to the rest of the characters, they are considerably more appealing than the various lowlifes that populate her novels. It's one thing to create likeable characters, it's another to create so many unlikeable ones."
4,Still a great novelist and storyteller,"George's strengths have always been great character development and excellent writing. Once you've waded through 50 pages of Sinners you can't put it down, even if you don't remember what happened in the prolog. But the plotting twists on itself too many times. And Lynley and Havers truly need to be given a fresher life. Why does George continue to insist, repeatedly throughout this novel, on Havers being so dumpy, and Lynley such a prig? Give us all a break in the next book and have them move on from the precious Indian father/daughter, and the stereotypical Lady Helen."
5,Fascinating look at the birth of carrier warfare,"I really loved this one. As a technology person and a history buff, I love it when a book brings history into terms you can relate to. Wildenberg successfully brings the pains and victories of the introduction of the technology and techniques of carrier warfare into easy to understand relief. Nicely done. Keeps your interest as you see how this emerged."
4,Shocked!!,"Just saw this movie, this is an awesome thrill ride in Pakistani settings. Being a horror fan, I would say this is one of the best. I was shocked to learn that the budget for this movie was well below $100,000 which is mind-boggling to say the least. Can't wait for the next flick by Omar Ali Khan."
1,It broke after 4 months of regular use,"Not recommended. This would be a great blender - if it didn't break. The gear used to drive the blades is connected to the motor by plastic (or some form of rubber, I'm not sure.) Regardless, the 'plastic' wore off after 4 months of regular use, making the blender unusable. This was a present, without a receipt, so we were worried about the return policy. The good news is we called Oster customer service directly. They were polite and are letting us exchange the blender by mail. They say it will take a few weeks. Until then, we will be looking forward to having our morning smoothies again."
5,Repair or replacement of #6700,"I bought two #6700's this Spring; gave one to my daughter who used it to make smoothies as she was having alot of dental work and eating hard food was a problem. She absolutely loved it and thought it was much better than other blenders (she is a doctor in Texas). While using it once, the dime sized thing flew off the bottom, inside the jar, and it stopped running. She brought it home and we exchanged 6700's while I tried to find an Oster repair to put it back together with no success. Walmart, where purchased, would not refund; only said we could get another in the store for an exchange; since purchased I have not seen this model in ANY Target, Walmart, Sams, etc.Could you tell me where I can get this 6700 put back together again in the Scottsdale, Az. area? Also, why is this model not available in these stores, or tell me what store I can get it."
1,Leaked everywhere !,"The first time I used this blender it left a large black mark on my counter. Then it began to leak black oil, and soon after it began to leak the contents of the blender - profusely ! I've put it back in the box and am awaiting a response from Oster......"
2,love hate relationship,"I bought this machine because I needed something powerful for smoothies. The design was nice and easy to use, you turn it on to the setting you want and it automatically goes off when it is finished. The smoothies did come out nice. It did not a make a decent milk shake though.The big problem I had with this machine was that the jar leakes very badly. It uses a different seal then other Oster products and can't be found without ordering it. When I say the jar leaks I mean that it REALLY leaks. Not just a few drops here and there, but after using for about a month liquid comes out the bottom almost as fast as it goes in!If not for this I think I would love it, but unfortunatley the flaw is fatalI also never recieved a response when I sent corrispondence to Oster about the problems. Not even a polite apology!If you need a good blender I would save my money and look elsewhere."
1,About the Oster model 6700 In2itive,This Model has been discontinued due to high failure rate. In less that two years I had three replacements Product leaks the motor locks up.. As a matter of fact I call sunbeam this morning @ 1-800-334-0759 and they offered a full refund ( if you have the original receipt or a partial if you don't have it provided you send the the plug and four inches of the cord( strange ) or a replacement. I picked the model 3200. as a replacement.
2,Won't start with clips broken,"I loved this blender, and didn't have too much trouble with leaking until I had used it for several months. What caused me trouble? The clips on the bottom of the skirt snapped off. After they all fell off, suddenly the blender would not go on. I superglued them back on so that the sensor would allow it to start. Now I have three clips missing. As one falls off, I glue it back on. I realize this is to prevent the container flying off the base and redecorating the kitchen, but why so poorly made? This is a powerful motor!!"
4,You just gotta check the gasket,"This is a real powerful blender. No more ice chunks in the smoothies.You do, however, have to double check the gasket. It can slide out of where it's supposed to be when putting the blender back together after cleaning. It's best to put the blender back together when it's wet."
1,Skip this one,"We bought two of these - one for our college age son and one for ourselves. Initially imrpessed with how it blended, we were soon disappointed. they both began to leak BADLY - and in less than a year one just quit working. We are not going to bother trying to fix it - it's not worth the money or time.We'll stick with kitchenaid from now on!~"
1,Inconvenient and flimsy,"After six months of use, the metal spindle actually snapped! It was always cumbersome to take the container apart; you have to use the cover as a wrench to open it. I used it for milkshakes, which it was never very good at; I had to stir the contents several times every time I used it to get the ice cream to the bottom."
1,LEAKS!!,We love the programming and the blending but we have to double the amount as it leaks half of what you put in. We did contact Oster and though much confusion got a new gasket and blade assembly. And it lasted three uses before it started LEAKING AGAIN!!
3,"My girl likes them, but...",They work but need to keep them plugged in to PC to charge battery. Ear peices keep falling out of my daughter's ear; i needed to purchase new ones that go around the head. All in all it is works nicely.
1,Unabridged???,"I purchase audiobooks because I want to hear the books completely as written by the authors. And that's exactly what I expect, especially when I see the word ""Unabridged."" The following is from the intro to this audiobook, as read by the narrator: ""Although his ideas are as needed and true today as a hundred years ago, the writing is hopelessly out of date because of the great difference in culture.In an effort to bring his thoughts back to life in today’s world we decided to edit and rewrite one of his most famous works Be Good To Yourself. Examples like the coal burning fire engine are replaced with modern analogies, things like eBooks are introduced and sexism is removed from the language. Otherwise we remained true to his original work and only made changes where necessary."""
5,Just What I Needed!!!,This book arrived several days earlier than I anticipated. This book is so empowering and encouraging!!! It's a daily reminder that should be included in your daily readings or meditations. I highly recommend this book. Its an excellent investment in your personal development!!!
3,Mesmerising,"This little known french film is no masterpiece, but those who choose to watch it will certainly enjoy themselves. Sandrine Kiberlain, most fragile and adorable, gives a lovely performance as the housewife who resorts to shoplifiting as a cry for help. She is met by a hypnotist who treats her. The hypnosis scenes are most enchanting, and Kiberlain is very lovely while ""under"", giving out more content to thesubject of a woman easily influenced in her acting, than in the script itself.Vincent Lindon is well supporing as the husband who finds himself ""betrayed"" by his woman, who allowes someone else deep inside her mind, where he has never been.Even if the script and the directing is conservative, the acting justifies buying this small pleasing picture."
2,Too polemical,"Although I found the book filled with interesting facts, its decided anti-religious bias turned the book into more of a tract against Christianity than a biography. Obviously every book has a bias and thats to be expected. But here it just becomes the point of the story instead of the approach of the author."
5,Nuts and Bolts on Water Engineering,"This was my textbook for Water Resources during Engineering School in the Spring of 1985. I have the Third Edition. It is well worn, underlined, highlighted and annotated, evidence of a very useful book! At my current position as Water Engineer at an Air Force Base, it is at the top of my shelf with my most used refernces. The right mix of theory and application. You will need a basic knowledge of Fluid Mechanics to use this text effectively."
4,Rescuing a Good Book from a Bad Review(er),"Patrick Carroll's Blacks in Colonial Veracruz is an excellent and informative piece of social history. Carroll's real contribution is to situate Afro-Mexicans within the broader context of history and society. This is a very useful book for anyone interested in the intersection of economics, labour history, and social identities in Latin America. While I would not claim that the book is beyond criticism, I feel the negative review submitted by Mr. Ed(below)to be seriously misguided."
1,Not great,I do not like this book. It is not what I expected. The patterns are old and I would never use any of them.
2,math errors,"This book is required for a State Contractors Test, that is the reason I bought it. The book is generally informative and is interesting to read. I believe that I found at least two examples where the math was simply done completely wrong. Not a math error, but concept issues which are very misleading and can confuse test takers. Do not rely on the examples to learn how to calculate area's and elevation drops in pipe. Otherwise, the book will provide some general understanding in the industry it represents."
4,From the ground-up,"This book is heavy. The lightest, easiest reading is in the index - from there on it's strictly business and takes you through the very bowels of the whole business.You could literally start, run and retire from the business with this book as a guide. It is very in-depth."
5,Hypafix Tape,Totally awesome product. Stays on in water and is thin and sticks like mad.My son' use's it on his heels for sports. Other athletic tape curls in his shoes and socksthis stays in place. A little too expensive to use as athletic tape on a daily basis...but it works best!!
5,Hypafix Tape,This is a wonderful product.I have very sensitive skin and have been using it for years with excellent results. Thanks
5,Excellent,Excellent product for securing gauze over a wound. Would recommend for anyone doing daily wound care. Does not tear skin and provides a cheaper alternative to taping.
4,The only thing that has worked!,"My 4 year old son has cancer and has a central line placed in his chest. We have tried sorbaview, and tegaderm as dressings around his line and he was allergic to both. He is even sensitive to regular paper tape!Hypafix was recommended by another cancer mom and so far it has caused less irritation and redness than anything else we have tried. Since it is not clear we have to change his dressings every other day to make sure the site is still healthy. Even with these more frequent changes his skin is still in much better condition than it was with the other types of dressings.Our Oncologist told me that my son is about the most sensitive to dressings and bandages than any of his other patients right now. I'm glad we found out about the Hypafix."
5,Great Purchase,"Great shopping experience. The textbook was the lowest price I found. In addition, the book was shipped as expected and in great condition."
4,Great overall,My almost 2 year old LOVES this movie. The character voices can be a little annoying at times but overall a great purchase.
4,This dvd was a hit at grandma's house,"My 4 yr old granddaughter likes this very much, is a good running length, good graphics of cute little mice;showing to be nice to others-to care instead of being rude. good dvd for small children."
4,Pretty Good,"In all honesty, it's not the greatest book ever, and S.M Sterling is certainly not what you'd call a great author, but the link to the film franchise was too much for me to resist.It's an enjoyable read, and, although there are many links to the first two films, it is not that essential that you see the films first, although it would abviously help. I also thought that the author tried far too hard to find places in the book where he could mention events from the previous adventures of John & Sarah Connor. It really didn't need so many references to the past, and it does begin to get rather tedious, but all in all, the idea of having Four Arnie terminator's, one infiltrator female terminator, and of course human 'Arnie'was an incredably bold step to take, and I think Sterling just about pulled it off. If you're a fan of the films, then read this book. If not, then give it a wide berth."
3,It's a good series ...,"Unfortunately, speaking for the three books in the series, it's COMPLETELY discredited by the events in T3.Having said that, (again, taken as a whole)I really enjoyed the hell out of each book. Well, book three was pretty weak, now that I think about it, but that's really beside the point. You just have to be reading each novel with the idea that it's an ""alternate"" to T3 and (unfortunately) not part of the ""real"" story bible.You'll just wind up frustrated if you try to piece this work in with the three existing films. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like anyone had the foresight to forward the T3 script to Stirling."
5,LOVED IT,The author really seemed to know both Terminator movies inside & out. I loved this book & hope he writes more! I think this might tide me over until the T3 movie comes out next year!
4,Good book by Stirling.,Bought the e book because I really liked the other books by Stirling. This one is not quiet up to his usual standard. He does an excellent job of another alternate reality. Makes the Terminators continue to take care ou Humanity. Well Done!Jamey
2,A little too much fiction in this science fiction,"Arrgh! I like the Terminator series, but this one stretches fiction too far! A human-turned cyborg/infiltrator (an I-950) in the future is sent back by Skynet to find and kill Sarah and John Connor. Her/its abilities to make new Terminators (T-101s) in the basement of her house gave me a science fiction headache! The ONLY thing novel in this book is the finding that the T-100 series is based on the physical profile of a present day anti-terrorism expert (retired). Why is poorly explained.The storyline, and Terminator fans, deserve better."
2,t2-infiltrator,"pure drek,i have had this book for two weeks its not that i am a slow reader,its just that the book is ...!!! now that i have gone 3/4 into the book i just kept telling myself ''this has got to get better''well it didnt! read at your own risk."
4,A nice addition to the Terminator series,"Stirling captures the bleakness of the dark future where mankind has been brought to the brink of extinction by the sentient computer SkyNet. He also captures the bleakness of today where a new terminator has surfaced, and plans on taking out the Connors along with prompting the birth of its own creator, SkyNet. Follow me? The book is a fun read, and I hope that another sequal follows. Stirling did some heavy research, and that shows through actual use of dialogue, and written description of scenes from both of Cameron's movies. Try to find the original two novels as well, and make a great day of it! One dark note is Stirling continued reminder that John Connor is the savior of the human race, and also that his speech patterns haven't changed much since T2. I don't believe anyone uses the word radical anymore let alone twice in one chapter. it's a fun read, and leave it at that. enjoy, and hopefully He'll Be Back!!!!"
3,"Good T, mediocre SF","Well, it has enemy robots who turn out to be heavy-weapons-bait. It has a fairly vague time-travel backstory. It has ""Hasta la vista"" and ""I'll be back."" Perhaps most importantly, it has-- throughout-- a solid, plausible depiction of what it's like to be a Connor. So if you liked the Terminator movies, don't let this book go by, because it's both faithful to the films and willing to create new elements.But it doesn't have the beauty and intensity of really good science fiction, and you know the good guys can't lose, so if you're the SF fan, not the Terminator fan, go ahead and let Infiltrator go by after all."
3,Makes good fodder for the next movie....,"...but is ultimately a pain in to read.I like how the author tied up the lose ends from the 2nd movie,but why waste 400 pages (yes 400) and not finish the book completely? I just hope Cameron wrote the script for the new movie, this book has proven to me that only Cameron can write for this series."
1,FREEZES AT ONE POINT,The game keeps freezing at the Nino Ruins Part and it won't let me continue playing Megaman Legends 2. !
3,Megamans quest for the Mother-Lode continues.....,"In this sequel to ""Megaman Legends"", Megaman continues to discover the secret to the mysterious Mother-Lode . But the evil Bonne family STILL won't quit to put him out of commission and claim the treasure for themselves !! Although, the original is somewhat better, this one is actually a worthy sequel . plus, the BOSSES, mini-BOSSES etc. are bigger & badder than ever ! Unfortunately, this could be the last in this 2 part series ."
2,[Not Good],The only thing I like about this long and boring game is the 3d effects.Basically your running around dodging stupid looking enimies until Roll can make you better weapons.What I cant seem to understand is how people actually like this game!!
2,This game is so boring.,"This game is so boring. The only thing that can keep anyone interested is watching the ending story. The new underwater ruins [upset] me. IT takes forever to move, even with those...hydro jets. If you played the original 2D mega man games, than this game is not for you."
2,"I'ts all right, but the original ones were better","Okay. I've always liked Megaman, but this one made me think that megaman isn't for the world of 3-D. I mean, hello capcom, let's face it, Megaman is meant for side scrolling and it was a lot better when it was side scrolling. X's old friend,Zero, that was his friend in almost every game, isn't in it. but I will say this: It was all right, but I think they took half an hour into making this game, so they could just put it in stores so the world would shut up. Even though playstation is meant for 3-D, it should be side scrolling. then they could probably take out the 3-D and give it awesome features. I've bought every single Megaman game, even the ones on the old NES, and bought all of them on super nintendo, and on playstation, and nintendo64. But if they make it on PS2, and I know it will be in 3-D if they do, it should be a million times better than this. Save your money and BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
3,Nordic Heathen Slow Metal from Italy,"Not much to say beyond the title of this review. The sound is perhaps a bit crunchy, the speed is slow to medium, the lyrics concern nordic/anglo-saxon battle and myth. There is a doomful feel over much of the work, a curious sensation. The musicians' ability is not extraordinary, nor is it unendurable. Overall average, with above average points scored for lyrics."
5,Another Calphalon Masterpiece,"If you love Calphalon and Pasta, this is essential. The pasta insert fits perfectly into the large stock pot so it isn't moving and banging around inside the pot. Water moves VERY freely throughout the holes so you never get stuck-together pasta. No more pouring boiling water into the sink to drain pasta and risk scorching yourself. As usual, it is a high quality, very heavy piece. It also cleans up effortlessly in the dishwaher!"
4,More Bargains for Parents!,"Although this book is not as extensive as Baby Bargains, it is still a must have for parents. They also should market this book to older babies, not just toddlers. My son is just turning one and I have found this book very useful for buying sippy cups, shoes and toys. It's great to be able to read recommendations from other parents."
3,eh...,"I got the soundtrack because I really liked the movie and am a huge Saul Williams fan, yet there is very little Saul on the album.I am a bigger fan of what many people concider ""concious"" hip-hop, and there isn't too much of that on here.Stand-out tracks are 10 and 17, but you can't really go wrong with KRS One or Dead Prez.The only tracks that are actually from scenes performed in the movie are 7, 11, 15, 19.I was dissapointed that saul's spoken word from the jail basketball court didn't make it onto the album.In short, the album is good for tracks 7, 10, 11, 15, 17, and 19, and I could really care less for the rest."
5,"If You Enjoyed The Movie, You'll Love The Soundtrack!",The soundtrack has most if not all of the memorable verses read including the music which really set the tone of the movie. There's Saul's last poem on this cd which is reason enough to buy this soundtrack!
4,Great replay value! I like the game.,"I had Superpower 1 and couldn't wait for this one to come out. When I first attempted to play Superpower2, the game had trouble starting do to having so many bugs. The bugs were taken care of with a number of patches over the years. I played this game for many hours trying different things with different countries. Most seem to talk bad about this game, but I enjoyed playing it! I would recommend getting the game and see if it's for you. Yes you could go on for days about what the game doesn't do, (like neighboring countries not getting angry for your massive build up of military units). The game is a starting point for other greats to follow."
3,Good Sim,"This a very interactive sim with a steep learning curve. Has bugs, have to download a patch to get past the cd key. Will not appeal to everyone. If you like sims, and you like problem solving (a lot) this is the game for you."
2,Fun for the first week,"It should be stated at the beginning that this is a Northstar protected game, and that Northstar systems do turn Trojan on you. My anti-virus just recently deleted the game and quarantined the executables.The gameplay is more fast paced than the original, but also a bit more simplified. Gone are the days of setting up Coups in 3rd world nations and controlling their puppet governments, not when you successfully stage one the rest of the world starts attacking you, and the country you over took will just start getting invaded by other countries. Usually Italy, China and Turkey. Playing as a 3rd World nation is substantially harder too as the AI now likes to become imperialistic at random intervals, mostly Poland, China and Turkey, making it very hard to keep a stabilized nation anywhere in Africa or Asia. But its still fun to Nuke the world and watch the fallout destroy continents at a time."
2,Fun but buggy,Well this game is fn i have to say that i like these type of games. It has a great wealth of knowledge about real world countries in it based as of 2001 but thats about it and is great fun to play before the bugs kick in. First bug i noticed was the sound the sound just started to loop could never figure out how to fix that with out restarting the game. Next is saving bug once i alrady saved a game once i like to keep games named the same but doing 2nd and 3rd saves at time really is a mess the game would crash and could never keep a nice game going for more then 6 years in game. Another bug i found is the research bug is still here fromt he orignal at times itll say you have not enough research in a area becuase its grayed out yet you have to have at elast a one in everything when ya start. The final word is they sent out a phase 1-2 beta for sell it should of went through more testing before released to the public and itll probley have lack luster support like the first one
3,Not Bad,"Havn't had much of a chance to get truly into this yet, but it seems pretty interesting.Combat is lame, and the interface is a bit clumsy, but there seems to be a healthy amount of depth to the sim. The game rewards those who are mindful of their economy, and opportunistic.Futureshop has it for 29.99 - save your 10 bucks."
4,Powerful motor but lacks some of the basic features,"I bought this 6 -piece kitchen center after buying several of the cheap stuff < $30.. all of them just stopped working! Out of the box, I liked this blender because of its different sized attachment jars and also the steel body. The steel body gives it a very stylish looks which goes well with my kitchen decor. Since I needed to use this blender for much more then blending juices, I gave it a tough job of grinding rice and pulses. Wow! it did an amazing job, which none of my earlier blenders did! The downside was that I had to mix the ingredients once in a while as this blender doesnt do a good job in mixing the contents. Also it is very noisy and sounds like a lawnmover.But overall I am pretty satisfied with this grinder. Does its job and I am gonna keep it for long."
5,The best hands down,"We use this ""blender"" if not daily it is weekly. There is nothing out there like it, Sturdy, durable, you name it! It does it all except fill itself well worth the money. When you decide you are done buying the cheap throw away models that last may be a year at best you will come here to get this. We had there various models and types all died preforming a task if it could be done at all. Once this Oster arrived it was put to work and work it did flawlessly and tirelessly."
1,"Misled, concussed and disappointed","I was replacing a twenty five year old blender I loved. Chose this because it seemed to come close. The first problem was that both the manual and the model tags indicated that this unit was made for sale in Mexico. The model number matches what is advertised, but beyond that it is hard to tell exactly what I really have.The unit is certainly not what I expected. The CHROME discription refers to chrome colored plastic, while the reviews reference a heavy metal base. I am still unclear as to why this discrepancy exists. I read and retread the material on the website, looked through a host of reviews, and can only tell you to be careful if you are expecting a heavy duty, long term model., this is not it.It is one of the most expensive units and there are far less expensive units which clearly indicate the housing is metal. Think carefully."
2,Does not work properly to make thick smoothies,"Very disappointed in this blender, for instance, the first day i used this blender it was incapable of making a thick smoothie, the engine smelled like it was burning up and I had to thin down the smoothie for the blender to work properly....... the blender is fine for making thinner smoothies which is NOT my preference"
1,NOT for Smoothies,"I don't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending...but this blender is junk. I have tried twice to make smoothies with it and this blender cannot do the job. All of the ingredients just sit there while the only part of the mix being blended is at the very bottom. So, you have to keep stirring and stirring and stirring the mixture to get it all incorporated. And then try adding the crushed ice. This blender is going back.If you need a blender to make smoothies, this is not the model to buy."
2,Disappointed,"Oster has been a quality product for us in the past, so I don't know if the quality has changed or whether Amazon shipped us a unit that had been returned. The return address on the package was the Amazon Return Center.The blender smelled like burning wiring insulation when running. The food processor gear mechanism had fallen apart and was in the bottom of the box."
4,Osterizer 4125 6 piece kitchen center,"Overall I like my new blender. Some people say it's too loud, but it's a blender. What do you expect? It does alot of work. It's easy to clean and looks good if you leave it out on the counter. The blades are very sharp so be careful when you take it apart to clean. I thought I needed a new osterizer because my old porcelin model seemed to be getting tired. Turns out the blades were dull and the motor was getting bogged down. You may want to try new blades before you buy a new one. I do wish they made a tapper for the bottom of the jar like you see on smoothie machines. Then you wouldn't have to lift the jar off of the base."
5,Take a test drive..,"This set is built like a truck, drives like a Porsche, looks like a Ferrari and has all the practicality of your favorite mini-van. Get it? Good. Buy one."
3,be sure to buy extra towels!,"Haven't had this for very long, but the accessories are nice, especially the food processor. Don't plan on using the milkshake attachment for very much at all beyond very simple milkshakes (it won't put a dent in small fruit like berries). The noise is insulting, not good at all if you have pets or live in an apartment (my neighbor has complained of the noise). It blends well, but the biggest caveat is that the square lid on the glass jar does not seal; everytime I blend I find myself cleaning up splashes in new and exciting places around my apartment - very aggravating. Also, if you don't crank down on the plastic base when installing the blade, the base can rotate right off during blending and lead to leakage."
3,"Cute, but disappointing","At 49 pages, this might better be called a pamphlet than a book. It is a relaxed philosophical soliloquy -- not the tight or bulletized summary that I had hoped for. I can just imagine the author leisurely smoking his pipe as he pecked out this book on his 1905 Remington typewriter over a weekend.Someone thought enough of this cute little book to re-publish it after 100 years. That's a beautiful act. But this book was not worth the trouble.A better alternative (but still not a perfect book) is The Psychology of Stock Market Timing by Peter Wyckoff."
1,Sony 200/400GB LTO2,"We bought 12 tapes and PAY the new tape price, only to recieve USED tapes, they have old labels written in hand.We received them in Miami and without opening them, sent them to Panama for use, then we discovered this.I can call customer service and they will replace them but they are asking for the old ones back and sending them back will be super expensive from latin america.This is a rip off."
2,"Poor value, not much additional material","This movie is not all that it is hyped up to be. The story-telling of the movie is poor, and the characters are not well-developed. Its only strength is in the music and the costume drama.Additionally, this 2-disc set is unnecessarily expensive and the second disc does not have much material on it. Other than the 48 minute documentary on early music and viola da gamba players, there is less than 20 minutes of additional material related to this film.The making-of-featurette consists of Gerard Depardieu laughing at inside jokes and getting make-up applied to his face in 10 minutes of home-movie quality footage. There is a 60-second TV interview clip with the director, a 5-minute TV interview which includes a long clip from the movie itself (so it is really only about 60 seconds of new material), a 2-minute TV clip of viola da gamba playing, and the original movie trailer.By no means worthy of a second disc."
5,Beautiful movie...,"This movie was wonderful. I love the viol da gamba.Great story. Beautiful soundtrack.""Music speaks for what words cannot"".That is so true. Music can cause a burst of emotions, good or bad."
2,"fascinating for a while, then gets boring","On the positive side, you may never hear a cello the same way again. It's also one ""arty"" movie where the story is clear and coherent. There's also the interest of seeing the 17th century re-created.On the negative side, the movie is dismally boring. There is also the annoying mannerism of filming scenes under-lighted (that is, dark)."
2,"beautiful music, awful movie","The music is superb in this movie. I give you that. But the movie is simply downright awful. To me this movie is about a man who becomes obsessed with the viola da gamba to escape the pains caused by the death of his wife. His obsession not surprisingly drives hime to be utterly self-centered and bizarre. He is a monster who abuses and neglects his whole family to focus only on himself. He wasn't making music for us or for the world ... he was making music for himself but by luck his music making is also enjoyable to our ears. Otherwise most of us would recommend that he be locked up in an insane asylum.If one were asked what makes a French film a stereotypical bad French film, one feature pops into my mind: pretentious philosophical babbling. And this film delivers a bucket full of it. Ugh.Get the soundtrack. Forget about this movie. This is my honest opinion."
2,Boring,"I ordered this from Amazon six days ago (it was only $16.49) because the local library did not have it (now they will). This movie is nice to look at (landscape, costumes), but it is absolutely boring, not worth the price or the time. The only interesting part is the Jordi Savall documentary on the second disc; be warned, however, that he speaks several languages (German, French, Catalan or Spanish) depending on the location; you may have to read subtitles--or, better, get a Jordi Savall CD!"
5,All the Mornings of the World,"Corneau's sublime meditation on music as all-consuming force is exquisitely realized, with outstanding set and costume design and jaw-dropping cinematography. Depardieu ""pere et fils"" both excel as Marais, but veteran player Marielle steals the show as St. Colombe, the forbidding, tortured musical genius, who still experiences visions of his departed wife years after her death. Don't miss this ravishing ode to the pain of lost love and the solace of music, a visual and aural feast you're bound to digest with pleasure."
1,CAUGHT FIRE !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the Worst coffee maker i have ever had. I bought it in March of 2004, and with in a few weeks, it started leaking coffee under the bottom. Then, in May, i smelled something burning, went into the kitchen, and saw smoke and small flames rising from the heating pad under the decanter. i immediately unplugged it and contained the fire. i threw that thing in the trash faster than you can imagine. It was nothing but problems since day 1. and when my house almost burned down becuase of it....... please pleeease dont buy this coffee maker, go with Starbucks makers, or Krups. It could save your life"
5,Marvelous assessment of the global human environment.,"Mark Hertsgaard's book examines the manmade problems that afflict the global commons. If you want to understand the interkinkages between the environment and economic development, read this wonderful book. It's a reporter's sobering journey yet a concerned scholar's work. -- Pranay Gupte, Editor and Publisher, The Earth Times."
4,Ambitious & Rivetting,"The author may be correct when he says this book is too ambitious. Regardless, he has, at very least, openned my eyes to the ecological devastation that may be realized sooner rather than later.Hertsgaard's recount of his travels vary from facinating to horrifying. His description of Russia's ongoing nuclear problems is enough to keep one up at night. Despite this, his objective analysis forces the reader to empathize with those we may be tempted to blame for these crises. Indeed, Hertsgaard's cultural observations alone make this book well worth reading.I highly recomend this book to anyone. You will be facinated by the author's journey and inspired by his conviction to stop the crisis that has already begun."
2,Well written first-hand account but...,"cheap shots take away from the message. Just once I'd like to read an objective book on environmentalism. For example, when the author talks about setting up a global fund he uses the same old ""for the price of 3 B-2 bombers we could..."" What about if we cut AFDC (aid for dependent children)? Or when Bush attended a conference in South America ""he stayed in air conditioned hotel with ocean views"" while thousands in the city lived in squaller. Where do you suggest he stay? I don't recall any similar slaps at the other side. Come on, tell the story without the politics or sign up as a lobbyist."
4,Great Bathroom Reading,"No, seriously. Very humerous, very cute book. Great for history buffs. Makes at great gift, I enjoyed it immensely."
3,Don't buy unless required,"This book was the required text for my first econometrics class. I found it unclear and ended more confused after consulting the text than before. It is very theory-based, and not very helpful if you're looking for a book about practical applications of econometric models. The only way I got through econometrics was using Pindyck and Rubinfeld's Econometrics book. Goldberger's book was short with too few examples, problems at the end of the chapter which were not discussed in the chapter. If you are buying this as a first econometrics book, don't, and if you're well versed in econometrics, then you don't need an intro book. This book caters to no level of econometric student."
4,Cute!,This toy is very cute. From the moment you bring it into your home you will get attached to it. It is a beenbag but is very soft. Perfect for any age.
4,A wonderful gift,I bought this as a gift for my friend who is crazy over bunnies. She really liked it and had never seen the bunny before in stores. So it makes a unique gift.
3,OK Light But No FREE Softbox,"The light is OK, I have used it for several shooting sessions with only one slight problem. The ready beep died shortly after I started shooting with it. Minor aggrevation but it's there. I decided to keep the light in order to avoid the exchange hassles.HOW EVER:The lamp is advertised to come with a free softbox and I believe that is just a cheap come-on. Several emails to Adorama got me nothing."
1,"the best part of this book, throwing it away.","I have not read any of John Lutz other work but after this one I never will. He plays up this big shot Homicide Detective come out of retirement to track a serial sniper, and the guy, Vin whatever his name is does not do much of anything in the investigation. The selling point should have been Vin comes out of retirement to get coffee and donuts for the rest of the characters in this book who do all the work. The story sounded interesting on the cover, it wasn't. Do not even bother if you are a fan of crime novels. the only crime is the hours of your life John Lutz steals from you in this book."
2,"Six novels, but all the same","I truly enjoyed the first novel by Lutz so I quickly ordered 3 more and then 3 more. By the time I got the first 3 and read 2 of them, it was too late to cancel the other order. His books are boringly repetitious. My suggestion: Read 2 and then forget the rest. They are all gruesomely, repetitiously alike."
2,Read 2 and you've read the all!,"I truly enjoyed the first novel by Lutz so I quickly ordered 3 more and then 3 more. By the time I got the first 3 and read 2 of them, it was too late to cancel the other order. His books are boringly repetitious. My suggestion: Read 2 and then forget the rest. They are all gruesomely, repetitiously alike."
4,Good mystery...,"I've read several of Lutz's books and have enjoyed them. While this was no exception, I did have a few problems with it. The book could have been shortened by about 100 pages. There were far too many victims killed by the Night Sniper. It seemed like every two or three chapters someone was being killed. It was a little too much for me.Also, there was not enough of Repetto actually trying to solve the murders. He would show up at one crime scene, tell Meg and Birdy what to do and then wait for the next victim. I would have like to have read more about him and why the Night Sniper wanted this retired cop back on the job.I was also a little disappointed in how the Night Sniper's identity was discovered. Repetto had nothing to do with it. It would have been nice if he had figured it out.That said the book did keep me interested right up until the end and I was never bored reading it. Four stars for this one."
2,Circular plot Around and round and round we go.,"A serial killer sniper wants only the worthiest of adversaries, so he demands a renowned retired NYPD detective come out of retirement to catch him. Lutz drops that thread and the detective becomes very inactive and fades into the background. (For an active protagonist, read Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.)In Fear the Night, people get shot and killed, shot and killed, shot and killed, but nothing ever changes. No one seems to catch up with this killer till near the end of the book. Also too much repetitive internalization. Round and round and round we go. Circling the drain but never going down.The characters didn't seem very sympathetic either. Maybe Meg and her newfound love interest, but that's about it."
5,Great Samael CD,There is no words to describe this album! This band is one of the greates bands I have ever listened to! My money was well spent on this CD! Buy it! You will not regret it!
4,The bucks stop here!!,"Ever felt something like 20 bucks or so left in your pocket? If so, then get this cd...it rocks...it amazes you!! True...this is not Samael's heaviest nor a classic, but it surely is their most eclectic work till date. Their visit to India in order to learn more about ancient astronomy and Indian Vedas is very much obvious in the album. ""Ailleurs"" has a smashing beat and ""Supra Karma"" is no doubt the best track in this cd, and Vorphaleck's vocals are as gothic and deep as ever.This is just the one for a hot lazy afternoon, or a wild night....Long Live The Swiss Metalheads!!!!!!!!"
3,Gone is Samael of old...,"I hate to say it but the Samael of old seems to be gone. Eternal is an album that really doesn't sound like Samael to me, it doesn't have the Satanic undertones, the awsome lyrics, the heavy riffs. They have seemed to trade them in for keyboards and a techno beat. The album is not all bad, it just isn't Samael, if you played me ""Being"" and told me that this was the direction that Samael was going to end up when I purchased Cermony of Opposites I would of said bull. Well now that has come true. I kinda like the album, not for being a Samael album like I should; I like the album because it sounds like Raminsten(sp). So if that is your cup of tea, than good ahead and get it. If you are weary of keyboards and techno, I would suggest staying away from it."
2,Weak,"The production on this album is great, but the content is lacking. At times the vocals sound industrial, way too synthetic for a metal band, especially this one. I'm all for progress and new directions, but only if they expand, deepen, or improve the original vision of the band. None of the songs here made an impact. They all just have this overdone, glossy allure that wears thin after a couple of listens. You can't wallow in their sound like you could on earlier albums. Eternal is too poppy; Samael have lost their dark edge."
5,steve is a clown,it is a good sound ..and a good change.... more creative than before...great music is defined by metal ....no more words ....
5,Clearly Perfection,"The most understandable and beautiful version I've yet seen. This is not a review, only a comment. In my opinion we need more books like this that relate to the average reader. It seems clear to me that this book was not written for the scholar, but the beginner; easily read, understandable and beautifully illustrated. R.C. Jamieson seems to have an ability to relate to this audience in a remarkable way!"
1,Leave Courtney be.,"I'm tired of people making money off of Courtney-bashing. If you have some real evidence, bring it to a D.A. If you don't, then fair-may-la-boosh. It's not that I sign on to everything she says or does, but she's trying to raise a daughter (who certainly can't be helped by the rumor-mongering), and in any case it's just disgusting that anyone's making money by floating these unsubstantiated factoids. Do you people have to scrounge this low for your next meal? I'll spring for your next can of chili. But puleeze, let the grrrl be! Perhaps you can find a spot on the D.O.J.'s new Tullulah Bankhead program (see ""Lifeboat""). Otherwise, what I say to them, I say to you: let you who is without stink cast the first jaundiced tome."
1,Misleading title,"This book would have been a waste of time even if it had been free.It doesn't answer the question in its title as it has no answers it is only a book of questions . . . what if this, what if that, what if . . .?I might as well have been spending the weekend with by sister and brother-inlaw and their 2 year old who only asks why this, why that, why, why, why?It was a poorly thought out book that has managed to sucker in thousands of buyers."
1,A waste of trees and time,"I have never read anything so poorly written before.This ""book"" is a waste of time and of paper."
5,A very good book about Nirvana and my god Kurt.,"This book is very good I would recomend it to any Nirvana fan or anyone looking for a good book. I will forworn you thought there is talk about sex, drugs, and violence. I also liked this book because it talks about my god Kurt Donald Cobain 1967-1994 may his music live forever.this book realy poots the blame on Courtney Love his wido. It talks about how she suduced him and controled his life. What the book is realy going for is they want the case reopened which would be interesting and good if they did. In my opinion a must read for any Nirvana fan or grunge music fan. For a personal note at the end Kurt Was murdered and if you read this book you will see how i got this conclusion although my idea was based on many different sorces and months of gathering evidence and search about the topic. Kurdt will always live in our hearts and may the music continue on for generations to come. Kurt D. Cobain 1967-april 8th 1994"
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL COBAIN FANS,"This book is brilliant and easy to read. It covers the life of Kurt pretty well and it also really makes you think about how he died. Did Courtney have anything to do with his death? Well, after reading this great book I must admit that I've got every reason to think she has something to hide. Wether or not she killed him or got someone to kill him you have to decide yourself after reading the book. The book dosen't answear a lot of questions but it sure raises alot of them ! A MUST READ FOR ALL COBAIN FANS."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"this book is a bunch of garbage. who killed kurt cobain? let's see... suicide... um..... No wait! maybe it's the same guy who killed nicole brown simpson & ron goldman!! yeah, O.J. says the killer is still on the loose...my god, TRUE nirvana fans know that it was suicide. and this book is a joke.i'll say this: it is interesting. but if you must read it, steal it or borrow it. don't buy the wretched thing.no matter how much people hatew courtney, believe it or not, she loved him and did everything she could to help him. and i cannot stand her being put at the forefront of this tradgedy.bottom line: save your money"
1,A must read only if you want to sleep,"I'm amazed at how authors like Ian can ""pretty up"" the Cobain story, the man to myth. Why read a fairy tale about Kurt? Factual accounts of Kurt's life and music make him far more real and interesting than this attempt at icon building. The attempt to magnify Kurt by the half-truths in this book fail. Far better books have been written about Kurt, Factual accounts make him more real than Ian's little story. Read Christopher Sandford's book if you want a cold look at who and what Kurt Cobain really was. This book is not worth the paper it's printed on. Buy it only if you need fuel for the fire."
1,CRAP!!,"this book is absolute crap..first of all, the title is crap. Kurt killed himself, as suicide. this book is totally fake and not factual at all. this author is crap and fake!!"
4,Loaded up on facts,"This book is not a murder theory. It does not imply anybody directly being involved in Cobain's death. It does, however, give you facts about Cobain's life beginning with his youth all the way through his tragic end (you decide for yourself who or what killed him). It is a retelling of the painful and tumoultous life of one of the most intriguing personalities of the punk scene."
5,Excellent!,It was a way good book! It had so many questions and evidence! I watched a show with the two journalists on it and it was really intresting. Me and many other fans still love kurt and his legacy will live on forever!!!
5,a very informative and interesting book,"Let me start off by saying that I was a big fan of Nirvana. When I first heard people talking about Kurt being murdered I didn't take it very seriously. When I first got this book I couldn't put it down at all, it is very interesting and well-written. It provides many, many facts in regards to Kurt's mysterious death, and as you keep reading, it becomes clear that 'suicide' was probably not the reason for his death. I highly recommend this book to fans of Kurt/Nirvana. If you read it with an open-mind you will see that the man did not kill himself and that there were other factors involved in his death."
5,¿?Who KILLED Kurt Cobain¿?,"""Who Killed Kurt Cobain (The Mysterious Death of an Icon)"" is a very well-written book. I must say that the author(s) of this book really did a great job. This book looks at all points of view, from Courtney Love to the band members, to the family, to the media, and even to Kurt himself. This book gives just about everyone a chance to say what they think happened to Kurt, and then presents evidence to prove/disprove theories. This book is a very interesting book I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get an understanding on what happened to Kurt. This book really does not state weather Kurt was killed or not, it just lays out some evidence and theories and let's you decide what you think really happened. It is an over-all good read, and I hope someday the case can be re-opened to see WHO KILLED KURT COBAIN."
5,Death of an Icon,"Though this book does not prove beyond any reasonable doubt that Kurt Cobain was murdered, information given will make you sit back and debate with yourself. I'm not going to give it away and tell you some of the information that has been revealed, but if you are a Nirvana fan or Kurt Cobain fan, i would highly recommend reading this book. It is a fast read and you will find it hard to put it down. Wether suicide was the cause or foul play was involved, it still a depressing thought that we lost a very talented individual to the almighty above."
2,adolescent prattle,"As much as I've loved Scottoline's previous mysteries, this one was a huge disappointment. The thoughts that Mary and Jack were having in their minds about the other were so amateurish that I had to look and make sure I was reading a Lisa Scottoline novel and not a romance paperback. This type of prose surprised me from someone of this author's caliber. Love her, hated this book, but will keep reading Scottoline because everyone is entitled to a bad one now and then."
4,WOW! Read this book!,"Lisa Scottoline is often referred to as 'the female John Grisham'. I think she is better. Fresh off the success of her last novel, Mistaken Identity, Scottoline serves up a heck of a legal thriller. The book starts out with a bang. Attorney Jack Newlin arrives home to find his wife, Honor, dead on the floor. Stabbed. He then decides to make it looks like he has committed the crime, because he is convinced he knows who really did it and is committed to protecting that person. After staging the crime scene to implicate himself, Jack then calls the police--and also proceeds to hire an inexperienced lawyer, Mary DiNunzio, of the Philadelphia firm of Rosato & Associates. This turns out to be a huge mistake for Jack, because although Mary is inexperienced in murder trials, she has passion and heart. She doubts Jack's confession from the beginning and begins to investigate the crime. What she discovers about the crime will keep you turning pages all night long!"
5,Another great thriller!,"Once again Lisa Scottoline has taken us through unexpected twists and turns in her latest legal thriller! Judy DiNunzio, an associate in Bennie Rosato's law firm, is the heroine! Her client, Jack Newlin, has falsely proclaimed his guilt in his own wife's murder. Who is he protecting?It's a ""must"" read -- a true Scottoline thriller! You won't be disappointed!"
5,"Improbable plot, but Lisa Scottoline makes it work!","How can a father and lawyer, Jack Newlin, frame himself for his wife's murder? If this sounds improbable, let me say it right now, Lisa Scottoline shows that it can be done in this fast-paced and sometimes humorous novel. Her characters are warm, well rounded and often very funny, and are enough to carry the questionable plot of this book to an interesting conclusion.Jack's rookie lawyer is Mary DiNunzio, a genuinely warm-hearted individual, who takes his case even when sha doesn't buy his story. Her legal associates, Lou and Judy, add to this interesting mix of characters, along with Brinkley and Kovich, two Philadelphia detectives who want to wrap this case up quickly and easily.Ms. Scottoline has again created another real winner of a book here. Also, don't miss ""Mistaken Identity,"" her sixth novel."
3,Good but Not the Best of this Author,"The story's good but, we don't get to know the characters as well as we do in some of Scottoline's other books. It's also helpful if you are familiar with the lady lawyers from her previous books so you know where she's coming from. To be honest, I was somewhat disappointed."
1,PAINFUL read,I'm not exactly sure why I didn't give up on this book after the first few chapters. I think I was interested to see how ridiculous it would get. Detailed in all the wrong places and just plain silly in most others. Please don't make the same mistake I made - choose a different book!
1,The only book I've ever bought that I threw away.,"I kept reading because I was thinking, ""Surely this book can't be this bad. There's got to be something ahead."" Alas, that was not to be. The plot was so full of cliches and leaps of credibility that I was amazed the book found a publisher. Maybe its publication was part of a number/book deal. That would explain it. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. This book went to the recycle bin as I would have been ashamed to trade with my reading friends."
1,What a disappointment!,"Scottoline's analogies for the most part were distractingly bad. For instance, describing a man's hair as being like the silver of weathered cedar shakes. Is she serious? And she didn't do her homework on the forensic stuff. Bodies don't stay in full rigor mortis very long. I think it is between 12 and 18 hours or so after death. The body of the victim was well beyond that at autopsy. Also, I don't believe pathologist do autopsies on bodies in full rigor. I found the main character uninteresting and not very bright.To call this woman the female John Grisham is wrong."
2,Superficial at Best,"There is absolutely no depth to this story. One wonders how the murder was solved because each character appeared to be more ignorant and bumbling than the last. I believe all female defense attorneys are probably thoroughly disgusted with Scottoline's character ""Mary"" (who appears to be a total ditz), and I doubt police detectives, portrayed as too stupid to be believed, are happy with this story either. This is my first time reading Scottoline, and probably my last. If this book hadn't been recommended and loaned to me to read, I would have thrown it out in frustration!"
4,"Fast, entertaining read","I like Lisa Scottoline. Her novels read fast, have a good balance of drama inside and outside the courtroom, and feature characters that are reappear in various novels and are easy to get attached to. This novel features Mary DeNunzio, a young, somewhat sheepish lawyer who gets involved in her first murder case, which turns out to be even more complicated than she expected. It's a good story, and I finished it wanting more."
3,Moment of Truth,"-Lisa Scottoline's Moment of Truth is a drawn out legal caper which is too much for one audio presentation. It should use a GOOD abridgement. The saving grace of this audio production is actress Barbara Rosenblat. Her audio talent makes this audio almost palatable. In a sea of drek, her talents are like a diamond in the rough. This audio novel should take a page from Grisham, less is a lot more!"
4,"Easy, enjoyable read.","This was my second Sottoline book - I've enjoyed both as they are easy, not too many characters to keep up with and the protaganists are women! She develops the plot so that you wonder from one minute to the next ""who done it"". Characters are developed fully - easy to picture. A good read for a lazy day."
1,Couldn't finish it. A waste of money.,"Very disappointed in this book. The writing was so juvenile and the plot so slow that it was actually painful to keep reading. If it had been a library book, I would have quit after the first 20 pages, but I hate to spend money on a book and then find it's so bad I can't read it. Sadly, this one was exactly that. The reviews of this book created the expectation of being absorbed in a gripping thriller. Far from it. I should have known better as I have found other Scottoline books to be very amateurish. Wish I had relied on that experience. What a waste of money."
3,Not her best,"""Moment of Truth"" has a somewhat farcical premise, that a father would falsely confess to murder to save his daughter. But the real problem (plotwise) is that the attorney is constantly running around trying to solve the ""mystery"" not trying to protect her client, and makes ethical errors that your average reader of legal thrillers will groan at. It's a quick read and not horrible, a good ""beach book"". Buy it used."
4,A FATHER'S LOVE,"In MOMENT OF TRUTH, from the moment that wealthy attorney Jack Newlin insists on confessing to murdering his wife, it's very obvious that he didn't do the deed. He believes his daughter is really the guilty party and he's decided to take the blame to save her. The only problem is that evidence is starting to show that his daughter may be innocent also.Then there's Newlin's tenacious, defending attorney, Mary Dinunzio, hired solely for her lack of experience, so that Jack Newlin will lose his case.Though MOMENT OF TRUTH starts slowly, it really picks up speed midway and that continues to the end. It's a good book with a solid, though slightly different story line. It's well worth the read."
1,Disappointed,"This was the first Scottoline novel that I have ever read. I selected it based on reviews, and I expected it to be a ""jaw dropping"" mystery/suspense novel. Overall, I felt that the characters lacked depth and the story line, particularly the ending, was too ""contrived."" If you want a quick read, go ahead and buy it, but I suggest waiting for the paperback edition or, better yet, borrow it from the library."
3,Not up to Scottoline's par,"I was loving this witty and well-paced book until I got about 4/5 of the way through, when the story and all credibility fell flat as a souffle in an earthquake. Where did that preposterous ending come from? The first 290 pages get 5 stars; the other 20% of the story gets one."
2,More Foul Language,"Mystery with an interesting twist. Why not write good stuff WITHOUT all the foul language? The cursing and taking God's name in vain doesn't make it more of a mystery, it makes it low level reading. How about raising the standard and give your characters something new to say when excited and scared??"
5,Excellent.,"I picked up this book in middle school, just a year or two after starting to play the violin. (I believe the version I have is out of print now; it's the beige cover with a painted portrait of Allegra playing the violin.) I'm several years into college now and still adore this book. It's not just aimed for a younger audience--it's a very well-written book that anybody, especially music-lovers and musicians (but most especially violinists and string players), can enjoy and get something out of. Each time I reread it, it still manages to surprise me and make me smile--Wolff's writing is incredibly intricate and precise, and she brings Allegra's world to life--there's much more to this book than just music, but it's amazing how wonderfully it all ties together. I highly recommend this book to anybody who's interested--this is definitely one of my favorite books that I've come across."
5,PLeAse rEaD mY ReVIeW,"Uh-huh . . . I don't CARE what anyone else says about this book. This is a book that belongs on your bookshelf. Actually, it shouldn't even be on your bookshelf. It should be by your bed (or where ever you keep books that you read all the time) and not sit in one place long enough to gather dust. I mean it. IT IS NOT BORING, unless you happen to be one of those blond cheerleaders (if so, you have my utmost and deepest sympathy) who is either illiterate or just can't comprehend such a concept as hard work and hard thinking. The Mozart Season is not only funny . . . it's real, smart, and um . . . soulfully staggering. It is definitely on my all-time-top-ten-books-list. You may not want to buy it just right now. Go to your library (you know, that building with all the shelves and shelves of books) and check it out. After you read it a few times, you may just happen to find some meaning in it. Try it . . . please. It is a good book, I promise."
5,Inspiring,"This book caught me from page one. It is, as I said, inspiring. Allegra is a character who is easy to relate to for anyone with a passion, or anyone who sings or plays music. This heartwarming tale tells of how she ""becomes one"" with Mozart's Fourth Violin Concerto, so she can play it in a competition. Allegra must give up almost everything ""fun"" about her summer vacation to develop her own style, and to discover part of her inner self and others as well. An excellent read!"
5,Wonderful story of a young musician,"As the story begins, twelve-year old violinist and softball player Allegra Shapiro has just discovered that she has made the finals of a very prestigious violin competition. ""The Mozart Season"" tells the story of her summer; of practicing, preparation and competition; of friendship; and of trying to find a ""lost song"" for the strange and disturbed ""Mr. Trouble."" A realistic, beautiful and inspirational story. I especially liked her description of Allegra's thought processes while she was playing; and the elevator conversation was hilarious."
3,The Moart Season*,"The Mozart SeasonThe Mozart Season is an inspiring novel for all young musicians.You will join Allegra Shapiro on her quest to win the Bloch finals violin competition. As she tries to find out what music really is and who she is inside; she tries to figure out a haunting secret held by her friend Deirdre.Allegra, a violin genius at only twelve years old goes for the gold in the Bloch competition. She uses a purse given to her by her grandmother who survived the Holocaust and WW II as a good luck charm. She feels connected to her grandmother, and her violin. Her violin helps her to understand life. She thought when she was younger, that the music was already in her and her parents' instruments and when they moved their bows across the strings it came out. Now she really is looking inside herself to see what life really can bring.Allegra has a very interesting life. If you enjoy music, and a little romance, I would suggest that you read this book.-A.C.W"
2,Good intensions boring book.,I had to purchase this book for a class. The first chapter is very informative however the rest of the chapters repeat everything from the first chapter but with examples. Yawn.
4,Multicultural literature,This is an excellent book to use for multicultural literature instruction. It defines good and bad literature and common themes. It also contains an extensive bibliography.
5,multicultural lit,great book! very informational and provides a lot of book titles for authentic multicultural literature as well as teaches how to analyze books for authenticity.
4,Through the Eyes of Many Children (3rd Edition),I used this text for a upper level class and it gave great insight into the class. It was used by our professor to review and make points brought up in class.
5,Multicultural class textbook,I borrowed a book for my Children's Literature class and found out two days before class began that the professor changed the textbook. I went to Amazon.com and ordered the new book and it was there in two days. I never missed a beat. Thank you!
1,Not worth it,"I used this at my mother's house over Christmas and must say that this is not a good blender. There is no noticeable difference in the 12 speeds - only between speeds 1-6 and 7-12 and I had to repeatdly turn off the blender, dig in there with a spoon to stir up the fruit (or ice) and then turn it back on again, then it turn off , dig in there with a spoon to stir up the fruit (or ice) and then turn it back on again... And even then I didn't get a well blender smoothie/milkshake.I personally own the ""Oster 4093-8O Classic Beehive Blender, Chrome"" and love it (I have a review there). Its well worth the extra $7.22 - makes SMOOTH drinks on one blending cycle."
1,"OK if you want a cheap blender, but you get what you pay for","I bought this blender a couple of years ago, and still use it because its all I've got. I want to upgrade! I use it about once every 2 weeks. It is fine for the most basic uses, but honestly all those buttons are joke - horrible to keep clean, and there is no difference between any of the speeds. And the food doesn't drop down properly, only the stuff at the bottom gets blended. And if there isn't lots of liquid in there, it doesn't blend at all. I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Good Blender - Fair Price,"I have used this blender as a ""second blender"" for about 5 years now.The reason for all the noise? (glad you asked!) All metal mechanics and sturdy glass jar. Which are also the reasons this machine will last and last.My only complaints are it takes longer to ""liquify"" ice (for smoothies or icy drinks) and it seems a little top heavy.I received a KitchenAid blender as a gift and it does the job much faster, more quietly and a little more effectively.The KitchenAid also has a stainless steel jar which keeps frozen drinks colder, longer.I like both of these units, but my suggestion is to spend a little more and get the KitchenAid.All considered you really can't go wrong with this unit.Keep Cooking!"
2,I Hate This Blender!,"I received this blender as a wedding gift several years ago. It doesn't blend very smoothly -- to avoid lumps, I have to frequently stop blending, stir the ingredients, and start blending again. It also doesn't blend things quickly. The worst thing about this product, though, is the noise: it is ridiculously loud (the disc sander, power drill, and other power tools in my home are all quieter!). The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that it has lasted several years without frying completely (though this may be too generous, as I only use it rarely and the motor smells burnt when operating)."
3,TOO LOUD!,"My main criticism of this blender is that it is entirely TOO LOUD. Even on the very lowest of the 12 settings, the noise this thing puts out is intolerable, and entirely unacceptable. It is extremely loud, and it makes me not want to use the thing. And actually, I'm going to return it without ever blending anything in it. My other complaint is that the blender jar wabbles in the base too much. This is not what I expected from Oster."
3,hospital gown,"Cotton is thin, garment constuction seems good. I purchased this for my mother and she is not able to tell me how it fits or tell the comfort of the material. A varity of patterns would be nice for fun"
1,Hell with the Fire Out,"Mr. Quinn wrote in his Preface: ""Anyone who regards this handling of the record as irresponsible for a historian should simply read and judge what follows as historical friction; with my blessing."" He is right and I have judged his book. At best it is an attempt to write a ""Creative History."" I believe this book is FICTION based on a true story. The only good thing about his book is that it can inspire readers to do a little on-line research that the author seemly has failed to do. The issues I have with Mr. Quinn's book are too numerous to list. The events Mr. Quinn has left out of his book are in fact the tip-off that this is not a historical account of the Modoc War."
5,A realistic and balanced depiction of the Modoc War,"While not a traditional history text, this book deals very plainly with the people and events of the Modoc War. Graphic depictions of the causes leading to the conflict and the battles themselves lead you to to able to imagine yourself as being there."
3,hell with the fire out,not as good as i thought seemed to be on the white man side. hell with the fire out.. i would go with the modoc the tribe that wouln't die. by cheewa james.
4,A great gift for new grandmothers (or grandmothers -to-be)!,"A nicely illustrated journal to record the heartfelt emotions of a grandmother for a grandchild. It covers a variety of information on the subject's life and feelings. A great keepsake. Note: Some of the content might be more suitable for a ""traditional"" family. I found that some of the questions might be uncomfortable for some family situations."
5,Appropriate,"Overall I think this book is appropriate for grandmothers who immigrated to the U.S. at some point in their lives. I bought this book instead of others because, while it touches on various subjects like ""I came to this country because ______"", it isn't intrusive about it. Other topics include things like, ""What I want you to remember about our family"" etc. I was nervous to purchase a book like this because one of the grandmothers in my family had a very hard early life; however, this book keeps it simple. Overall, very appropriate."
4,Just what I wanted...,This book is a wonderful tool for grandmother's to pass along to grand children. Ask's all the right questions and has extra paper and pockets for additional items. I am giving this to my grand mother because I wanna know all about her life and have her pass down all the important information I might need to know some day.
5,"Attention, cat lovers","A fun book for all cat lovers, and those owned by cats! Each page brings a new surprise. A ""must have"" for those who like kitty lore."
3,Tactics for ___Beginners___,"This book is for beginners. Just for beginners. It has lots of ""nice"" positions but it's _too_ easy and obvious. I didn't like the comments on each problem - sometimes Bruce is very ironic and looses the _real point_"
1,Utter Garbage!,"We bought an Oster Beehive classic based on reviews here that said it had an ultra-strong, all-metal drive shaft. Well, we had it for a week when the ""ultra-strong, all-metal drive shaft"" sheared right off: it is actually all-rubber in construction: the metal does not go all the way through!I called Oster, and they agreed to send a free replacement. It arrived today (after a two week period with no blender). My kids got excited and asked for smoothies. I very carefully followed the manual's instructions, filling it with juice and adding one, tiny, pathetic half-strawberry at a time. On the last one, there was a sickening clunk, and, you guessed it! The drive shaft sheared off again! This happened five minutes ago, and I will quite definitely not buy another Oster. There was no abuse or misuse here, folks: this product may be super solid, but the weak link is the rubber transfer coupling, and it WILL break, leaving you fifty dollars poorer.Save your money."
1,Very Poor Designed Drive Shaft!,"I must totally agree with the reviewer that called this blender ""Utter Garbage"".Same thing happened. The drive shaft sheared off after filling it with water and then dropping in a piece of banana.The really crazy thing is this exact thing has happened 3 times in less then a year. Sure they send me a new blender each time it happens but it takes 2-3 weeks to get the new blender. So no blender in the house for 2-3 weeks each time this happens.The ""Utter Garbage"" reviewer left her review in Sept. 2004 and today is March 5, 2008 and it still seems to be the exact design on this model blender.I will just keep calling for a new blender each time the new one they send me breaks, but oh what an inconvenience! Just say NO!"
1,very dissapointed...,I have owned this blender for a bit over a year now.It is extreamly noisy. The motor is not nearly as powerful as my prior cheap blender. It really struggles to mix any kind of food.Now it started leaking. The support for this blender is horrible. There was no part # for the blade (source of leak) in the manual. I called their 800 number and a recording said they had too many calls and to call back in another time.I will never ever buy an Oster product again.
4,Powerful and Great Design BUT NOISY,"I bought this a couple of years ago and love the simple design...I hate those new style blenders that have the big bottom jar. BUT the noise on the higher speed is intolerable to me....I have to cover my ears. Also, the bottom of the glass jar broke where the blade screws on so now I have to buy a replacement. But for power and ease of use and design it is great."
2,Great looking and functional but way too loud!,"This blender looks great on the counter and functions well; we use it daily to make smoothies and it chops ice easily.However, I've owned six blenders and this is by far the loudest. I expect a blender to be very loud, but this is truly ear-splitting. My last blender was also an Osterizer and the noise level was much better.We've lived with this one for about four months and have finally had enough and are going to buy a different blender. (I'm going to look at Consumer Reports and see if their reviews cover noise level!)Perhaps I just got a bad one and most are fine, but I'd stay away from this model."
4,Will Blend Anything You Feed It,"I make Green Smoothies every morning which consists of blending raw veggies & fruits along with wheatgrass, ice, & other things and this blender is great at turning it all into a very smooth drink. I've even put steak in the blender in order to make it chewable for my baby. I would recommend this blender to anyone."
1,"Shame on you, Amazon!!!","While the quality of the blender is not in question, the quality of the shipping leaves much to be desired. The box was prviously opened and the blender top was missing. The product was advertised as new.The product was a gift, so when the person opened it...well, you can imagine the embarrasment.Nothing like Amazonian quality!"
2,Not the way to write a book,"Some stories of the book are terrifying, some are boring and many of them are alike, some of the killers are important celebrities, some of them just kill once and some of them kill just a dozen, but when you finish the book you won't care anything about these killers, why? Because when you read 10 or 15 stories you will know how will be the next story in this book. RGJ wrote to many stories just because all of the killers were women and he wanted to write many pages, but he might write just the celebrities or the serial killers, but he went through the past and if he found a woman who kills somebody he just wrote it in the book, that is not the way to write a book."
3,Better than it's predsessor but still not the best,"This movie wasn't bad,I didn't mind Godzilla against Mechagodzilla but it was boring mostly except for the last battle and when Godzilla shows up. This one improves with much more action and adds Mothra. This movie seems like many movies we have seen before especially when Godzilla is wrapped around with two baby Mothra's web. We have seen it all before. Anyway a not bad point in the series but far from the best."
5,Can't Believe I Didn't Pick This Up Earlier!,"I grew up watching these films, I even own a VHS set with Godzilla vs Megalon, Gigan, Mechagodzilla, etc. I had seen a bit of Godzilla 2000 a while back, but after seeing this flick, I'm gonna have to revisit that one, along with the other films a part of the millenium series. I loved how updated it was. Godzilla & Mothra looked great, and the story with the Japanese controlling Mecha G was very captivating. I think there was enough action, as well as plot which is something I don't remember from any Godzilla movies except 1985. This movie blows 98's US Godzilla out of the water! Thanks to Toho for distributing another great Godzilla flick, just goes to show these movies aren't dead!"
4,One of the best (Top 5 of all G films),"This has to be one of the best in the series. After being bored with the last MechaGodzilla film, I was pleasently surprised with this one. If the series would have ended after this film, it would have been a fitting ending. Hopfully Final Wars won't disappoint. If your A Godzilla film fan. Don't delay BUY this film."
4,another decent movie,This is a direct sequel to Godzilla against mecha godzilla. It has good graphics and marks the return of the classic mothra. This also marks the end of the millineum series.
3,MECHA G SAVES GODZILLA!!!!,"OVERALL THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE. THE TWIN FAIRIES WARN MANKIND TO SEND GODZILLA'S BONES BACK TO THE SEA. THESE WERE THE BONES FROM THE ORIGINAL GODZILLA WHICH WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT MECHAGODZILLA. MOTHRA AND MECHA G TEAM UP TO FIGHT GODZILLA UNTIL MECHA G DECIDES ON HIS OWN TO SAVE GODZILLA FROM THE MOTHRA LARVAE. BECAUSE OF THE BONES AND GODZILLA'S ROAR, MECHA G FELT A KINSHIP TO GODZILLA SO HE WOULD NOT RESPOND TO THE CONTROLS AND SAVED GODZILLA'S LIFE."
3,Great for True Godzilla Fans,"My almost 7 year old son LOVES Godzilla movies. He has watched this one at least a dozen times already. It is better than some of the other Godzilla movies out there. If you are even considering buying this then you must be a fan. Go for it, you won't be disappointed."
4,My son's great gift,I got this for my son as a Christmas present. He collects Godzilla videos and I must say that it is a decent story line. Kids will like this modern day version of Gozilla.
2,GODZILLA SOS DISSAPOINTS!,Godzilla SOS is a dissapointment in my view. Yes the special affects were great compared to the other Godzilla movies but a lot did lack here. The number one thing that made me give this feeling was the lack of a good story. Im sick of TOHO retooling there KAIJU to take on different roles. Im sorry but growing up MECHAGODZILLA was a bad guy and thats that. If they had done a better job introducing mechagodzilla maybe I wouldnt feel as bad for it. Or why not just make another robot totally new.
2,Lame!,"I wanted to like this movie and I approached it with an open mind. I realize you have to just suspend reality sometimes and go for the visuals. Unfortunately the first 45 minutes of this movie is tedious as it focuses on two 4"" tall girls that appear and warn that Godzilla is coming. The 4"" tall girls sing songs and are about as cheesy as you can get. More mind numbing events occur as the story shows more of Mothra and it's larva then Godzilla. I could not even recommend this movie for children to watch, as the will certainly be board to tears and also *SPOILER* there is a graphic scene where the moth gets roasted alive. So no exactly wholesome fun for the kids to watch. Instead of this movie, I would recommend Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla or Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla both of which have not stop action, incredible special effects and more interesting stories."
2,Not a very good G film.,"I liked Godzilla X Mecha Godzilla. This was a horrible sequel to it. It's real title is G X Mothra X MG: Tokyo S.O.S, they should have called it Godzilla X Mothra AND Mecha Godzilla because in the movie, MG and Mothra didn't fight once in the film. Mothra looks better than ever in this movie. Still, I didn't like this film. Hopfully you won't either."
3,S.O.S. for Sequel of Sequels,"This film continues the story of Godzilla X Mechagodzilla, and as a sequel, well, it is a swquel. Though the action is good, this film suffers from a little too much repetion of standard old plot devices. Mothra's first appearance is very cool, and the return of Kiryu, a.k.a. MechaGodzilla is exciting. The use of stock footage from previous films links it strongly to the long series, but the ending is a bit unsatisfying, though the larvae wrap up the story effectively."
3,It's a remake and going back to the 80ies,"Well, well, just watched the move today again and I was bored. The predecessor is much better. They copied nearly everything from the movie before and added Mothra and a 'hero mechanic' - no not a mechanical hero :-).Also this movie features some very typical Japanese issues like dead man can't walk on the ground - Mecha Godzilla has to return to the sea, where it came from to find peace. Mothra is killed in this movie - but don't be disappointed - two larvaes take over and finally kill/hibernate Godzilla.The story also contains two uncles, one of them the original one who went to Bonfide island to discover Mothra more than 40 years ago and a nephew, who is the typical child identification. So far a good Godzilla movie, turning back the battle style to the 80ies.Well I found this movie watchable but the predecessor was much better. I give it three stars but please make your own picture."
5,Cool monsters,"Cool monsters and cool robot. This one ties in with the original Godzilla, so recommend getting that one with this one."
5,Excellent,LOVE this dvd why these Godzilla movies are better than the old ones.Order four all came together in same order .Packing is way better than some orders I have .NEW BOX NEW CARDBOARD PLUS plastic wrap to. Watch the best monster ever GODZILLA with new special effects.
5,Mothra,"Mothra will protect Japan from Godzilla. However, if Mecha-Godzilla does not return Godzilla to the sea than Mothra will bring destruction to Japan. The two aliens bring Mothra ultimatium to a scientist encounter 43 years prior. The race is on for Mecha G to defeat Godzilla and return him to the sea. Mecha G is 37 percent damaged and not functional. Emergency measures are enacted to ready Mecha G for a final show down with Godzilla."
5,First Godzilla dvd we ever bought!,"And we are now addicted! Fun for the whole family! The kids love it! Easy menus, english dubbing available as well as original Japanese version! Worth the money for a classic movie lover!"
3,Not The Best,"Let me start by saying i own all the Godzilla movies in one form or another and am not very impressed with this one. High in spirituality and while the action was good it wasnt anything not seen before. Mechagodzilla and Mothra are wearing pretty thin after all these years and its just more of the same. While i know the alien plots have been used and reused in the Godzilla saga, at least a different type of alien is the norm and would have been a help in this outing. Whether true or not ive read where this will be the last Godzilla movie for sometime so while its not the best by far it is one the collector would want. But if you just want some good Godzilla i would recomend any of the four before this one. I really looked forward to this one and am dissapointed."
2,Big disappointment,"Kinda lame. First off, I'm a major fan of the big ""G"". I own every Godzilla movie from the original ""Gojira"" subtitled without Raymond Burr, right through to GMK. 90% of this clinker looks like they simply re-filmed scenes from previous Godzilla movies. Mothra fighting Godzilla. Godzilla frying Mothra. The baby Mothra's shooting webbing all over Godzilla. Etc, etc. Come on! We've seen it already! Can't really see how other ""G"" fans gave this thing 4 or 5 stars, unless they like watching updated versions of stuff they've already seen before."
3,"More action, less character development!","There is one thing that I have discovered watching the ""Godzilla Millennium"" series. They make me long for the old school Godzilla films, directed by Inishiro Honda, who placed action above character development.However, despite having to watch 30 to 40 minutes of having to deal with whether or not Godzilla will attack, or whether or not either Mothra or MechnaGodzilla will save Japan, the movie accelerates into high gear. I only wish that you didn't have to wait for the action to begin. It's a fairly good movie, obviously whetting your appitite for ""Godzilla: Final Wars""."
3,Ummm....,"A helpful hint to all whose brothers force them to watch this movie: WATCH ALL OF THE OTHER GODZILLA MOVIES FIRST. Between mini singing Mothra girls and Mechagodzilla and the inept Tokyo army dudes, jumping into the Godzilla canon at this point is too confusing. I enjoy the dubbing on this movie, as there is absolutely no attempt to synch the English with the Japanese, it once again provides the highlight of every Godzilla movie I've ever seen."
4,Great design but not as high of quality as other pans,"I love the design of the Windsor pan. The narrow bottom allows for very quick and even heating and the wide top makes it easy to stir sauces without lots of spatters. However the Windsor has a thinner aluminum on it that the standard Calaphalon commercial saucepan. Also, this is the only Calaphalon piece of the dozens that I own where the hard anodized coating has actually worn off from the interior of the pan. I was hoping to get a replacement because the coating, under normal use, should not wear off. However it doesn't appear that Calaphalon makes this design any longer. It's nowhere to be found in their current line of products."
5,This book is great! I'm an absolute beginner,I am just starting my quest to make sense of the guitar as an instrument. I bought this workbook and I'm only about a fourth of the way through and I feel like I've learned so much already. If you are just starting out with the guitar and want to truly understand the notes on the fretboard and how to be more able to locate them then this workbook will do just that for you. Very glad I found this book. Highly recommend it!
4,Great Book,"This is one of the better books I've read for the guitar. I had considerable difficulty with the fretbaord; however, after using the book I have improved greatly. The contents of the book is easy to understand. I would recomend this book to anyone."
5,Fretboard Magik,"This is one of the best books I've ever read for guitar. I have always had trouble finding my way around the fretbaord, but after working with this book I have no trouble at all. There are so many helpful tips and exercises that you can't help but become ultra fluent on guitar. And unlike most books, the material in this book is presented in a manner that is easy to understand. It's all connected perfectly, instead of YOU having to piece things together. I would recomend this book to anyone."
5,Just what I've been looking for,"I've needed a book to 'put it all together' for a long time, and that's just what this is. Dull, boring and HIGHLY instructive. :) Much better than memorizing licks, and worth the effort it demands."
5,Excellent book! A must have.,I've been playing guitar a long time and this book really helps you get an idea how the fretboard works. I recommend that you get this book first and then MI guitar soloing by Daniel Gilbert & Beth Marlis. It will help you unlock your soloing abilities and take you to the next level. Best of luck.
4,Puts it all together,"I definitly saw the patterns on the fretboard after, where there was just massive confusion before. If you know just a little bit of theory to start, you should have no problems getting through the excercises. In fact, the book will pretty much complete your theory training by the time you finish. You will end up having the knowlege to create any chord anywhere on the fret board. Pretty cool results for not to much time vested."
4,Do the exercises and you'll learn the fretboard,"The system is excellent, and there's a whole lot of useful material beyond just learning where the notes are. If you do all of the exercises as you're supposed to do, you will either learn the fretboard (and a good bit of other stuff) or maybe you should take up another instrument.It's only fault is that once you fill in the exercises there's no way to go back and do them again. All music instruction books with exercises in them have this problem, however, so it's a little hard to complain much about this one. I suggest copying the exercise forms, though that means a lot of copying. It'd be nice if instruction books would provide three or four copies of the forms needed for the exercises."
5,Solid,"I've been playing guitar on and off for over ten years, and I wish I would have found this book right when I started playing. It has helped make guitar playing interesting again, I am blown away by how much I did not know. This is a very useful book for everyone not just beginners."
4,Great but a bit boring,This is a great book for learning to really understand the fretboard. It's pure excercises though. To me a 5 star book has to have you learning while you also enjoy what your playing. A lot of this is rote stuff that you just drill til you get it. The book does pay off though and I recommend it to a serious player willing to put in the time.
5,excellent hands-on workbook,"I've been ""playing"" guitar for years, but never bothered to learn scales or musical theory. The exercises were very helpful and allowed me to visualize concepts that had evaded me all this time. I recommend this as a pair with Music Theory Workbook for Guitar Volume 1. This one contains less exercises, but explains concepts a lot better. I'd suggest starting out with this one and moving on to the more detailed exercises in that book."
2,Weak,"This book would be a lot better if it explained things more thoroughly and relied less on the reader drawing scale diagrams. Doing the work is fine but the book just doesn't explain the topic very well. Also, I found several errors in the first 30 pages--diagrams wrong, explanations wrong, answers wrong (like, where is E#????), etc. It does a poor job of explaining the relative relationships between scales. I gave it two stars because of the root positions diagrams. These were very useful. Could have been a lot better."
2,Important yet BORING - for EXTREMELY super-motivated ONLY,"I find his books to be 'comprehensive' yet uninspiring. Way too much ground vs. practically covering the ground well and making practice still at least a little bit fun.I also find his guitar playing extremely boring from listening to his clips online. Had he been a killer player that had emotion and didn't sound like music school noise, I would have been much more motivated to see it past the first half of the book (at which point, I dropped it). Ditto for his other books."
1,Very rudimentary stuff,"If you know the very, and I mean very, basics of the guitar and theory then this book is a waste of time and money. I found out the hard way. If your just beginning (like picked up the guitar yesterday or a month ago) then this book may be for you. If you've been playing for more than 6-12 months you should already know this stuff. I am so mad that I wasted my money. Grrrrr!!!"
4,refret job done at home!,"This very helpful book provided me confidence to tackle a partial refret on my 12 yr old washburn D34S (wideneck: 12 fret). It's a scary moment when you start pulling frets out of the board, believe me! I will say that no book is completely thorough in describing such work, but this is one of the better resources I have found."
1,Totally useless for a beginner,"If you are a beginner like I am, you may well find this book as frustrating as I do. There are many books out there who explain the same subjects in a much easier way. This book is a waste of money !!!"
1,not a good book to learn anything. very confusing,"I am trying to find a book that will explain how to position your fingers for different cords, maybe show you how to play a few songs, and perhaps show you how to strum the guitar in an effective manner, said that. this book is not at all what I was looking for. even you are a good guitar player you wont be able to make heads of tales of the material on this book."
2,dannys opinions,the 5 octeve positions patterns is great to know how ever school book formate I did'nt care for.
5,I wish I found this book 8 years ago!,"I wish I found this liine of books 8 years ago...I would have been able to progress at a much faster rate with more understanding. I bought this book a couple weeks ago and began studying it immediatly. The method the author uses is very effective, whcih he calls draw/describe/play. using this method, he illustrates patterns that show where all the notes are, allowing for a more easier method of learning the notes and understanding the fretboard.if you are a beginning guitar player, get this book, it is essential"
5,Guitar Fretboard Workbook Works,This is an excellent overview of the guitar fretboard. Very helpful and easy to follow. I learned a lot in a short amount of time.
2,this may have some value,"but it is definitely the case that I had buyers remorse for not having been able to actually pick up the book and leaf through it to see its potential value.It's possible a beginner or young practicioner might get something from this, but it's not for the experienced."
1,Boring and confusing book.,"Do no waste your money on this one. I am a collector of any books on Princess Diana and have read them all. In my opinion this book is terrible. The author is using the guise of writing about Princess Diana to bash Paul Burrell, President Bush and Tony Blair and the Iraq war. He begins to tell you something about Princess Diana then the next thing you know he is off on a tanget about something else. This is a very boring and confusing book. It isn't interesting enough to keep the reader's mind alert."
4,Kind of Small,I ordered this for a friend as a gift. I was a little disappointed. I thought this was a coffee table type of book. I guess I should have known from the price that it would not be very large. However she loved it and said that has some very interesting information in it; even for a seasoned Mah-jongg fanatic.
4,beautiful but small,"I bought this for my mom for the upcoming holidays...it is beautiful...the pictures are lovely and she will love it...It is very good quality paper, etc....I don't know why I thought it was going to be bigger..I should have read the dimensions...but it is a bit smaller than I hoped."
4,OEM BC-05 Review,The quality of the color and print are good but the price of a new OEM cartridge is way too high. They should also last longer. By the time I buy 3 OEM cartridges it cost more than my printer.
5,Great cartridge-restored life to old seldom used small printer,I had an old Cannon Bubblejet printer unused for several years that I wanted to put in my workshop. Local store did not carry ink so found this on line and was inexpensive. The printer is printing great color pages and quality is great for it's age.
1,Do not buy from databazaar,"I bought a refurbished cartridge from this seller (databazaar) and it did not work, twice! Sent it back ( which was a HUGE hassle) and the replacement didn't work as well. For that price (& refurbished) it was a waste of my money and time. I ended up taking some old ones I had to a local ""printer ink refil"" place and had to pay $40 for the both of them. Guess I shouldn't (and I will never again) buy an ink cartridge on amazon! Still out the $15 I spent for the broken cartridge..."
5,+1 buy,"The cartridge was shipped to me quickly and arrived in perfect condition. The box it shipped in was a little damaged but the item inside was unharmed. When I need another one I will definatly check out this company again! I did recieve a confirmation email that said I bought black ink but when I called the company they had the order correctly for colored ink so that wasnt a big deal, a little inconvienent but it was easily cleared up with a two minute phone call."
4,"Good History, a bit dated","The Future of Iraq, Updated Edition: Dictatorship, Democracy, or Division? suffers from the curse of many PoliSci/history books that events on the ground date them before they reach the public, thusly the last section on the US can do with Iraq is absolite unless your comparing what the US government has done with the ideas in the book. That being said, this book does provide a nice history that would allow the average reader an explanation as to why Iraq is such a fragmented state and has given the United States military and civilian leaders so many problems over the last seven years from both an Iraqi view, and the view of the Bush administration. For a better understanding of Iraq try[[ASIN:1588264386 The Iraq War: Causes And Consequences (Middle East in the International System)]by Rick Fawn, which breaks down the impact on the Iraq War for the United States throughout Europe and the Middle East country by country."
5,Enjoyable to read and enlightening,Anderson and Stansfield have written a wonderful book that will appeal to both general readers and students. Its calm tone is a welcome change from a lot of the polemics about Iraq and it provides the reader with clear analysis of Iraqi history. My only complaint is that it is out of date. Hopefully a new edition will come out soon.
5,WE CELEBRATE YOU,"This is an excellent series of songs, Shannon Wexelberg has a fantastic voice and this is a great group of praise and worship songs. Very uplifting. I would recommend this to everyone. I love it"
5,Beautiful and Meaningful Music,A really beautiful praise and worship CD that can lead worshippers to enter into a deeper state of prayer and spiritual relationship with the Lord.
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I bought this unit to serve as an UPS for an 8-core Mac Pro and its dual LCD displays, and it talks to the Mac via the USB connection. Setup was trivial - just go to the Mac power setup. We've had a few brief power outages, and the CP1200AVR has kept the Mac operating just as it's supposed to. We have also tested it with a longer power outage, and with the USB connection, the UPS has shut down the Mac after the right interval, as designed. What's more, unlike some of the other CyberPower models (the AVR-G types), this model allows the Mac to go to sleep.What can I say? It just works like it's supposed to."
3,Reliable?,"Purchased one unit for desktop computer, and it has been fine for 10 months. Purchased another for a network server, and plugged a laser printer into one of the battery back-up sockets. Red lights flashed each time the laser printer was used (for about 1 week). Reconnected to surge only outlet as recommended by Cyber staff. Battery backup functions failed about 2 months later. Brand new replacement failed (battery backup sockets only) 1 month later with no laser ever attached (server, 17"" monitor, and electric typewriter only). Cyber repaired the second unit under warrenty but sent me back a refurbished 800AVR. After notifying company, they are sending a brand new 1200 AVR unit with apologies."
1,Not durable,"I bought it a month ago, but already returned it.There is a durability problem.The spinning rod was easily broken with just several usages.I don't recommend it at all."
1,Too much to dislike,"I've been limping along with this blender for a few months now. As others have noted, the jar doesn't lock to the base, which is more than annoying--though if I hold it there, it doesn't feel unsafe.That said, while washing dishes today the jar (empty, disassembled) was gently knocked to the floor from the countertop--a distance of no more than 3.5 feet. Something about the way the jar hit the floor made it shatter into three pieces. The handle came completely off, leaving a jagged hole down the side of the plastic jar. I would think you'd need to smash the thing against the floor (or with hammer) for it to break like this. What's the point of plastic otherwise?"
3,You get what you pay for...,"I just purchased this blender. I am overrall happy with it. Except for two big major complaints, - FIRST THE JAR DOESN'T LOCK ONTO THE POWER BASE. I'm afraid one day it will just fall off the base while it's on and make a mess. Plus, that's dangerous. I guess you should be safe and hold the darn thing on while you're blending. I tried contacting the manufacturer but with no such help.Second, the darn thing is loud. I've never had a blender of my own before, but I never remember them being this loud. I live in an apartment and I was afraid of waking my neighbors.So, I would probably not recommend this model to anyone. Go for something else, I'm stuck with it."
5,Rated best blender by America's Test Kitchen.,The lid is not meant to be put in the dishwasher. I love this blender. Oster makes really great blenders at a low price. Their motors are strong and the blade is sharp enough to crush ice. The all-metal drive means that you don't have to worry about it breaking down any time soon. The plastic jar is better than the glass ones because they are lighter and won't shatter and break when you drop it since it's break-resistant.
3,not made well,This blender is not made very well and can only be used for very basic blending needs. The plastic jar is cheap and the lid warped in the top rack of the dishwasher. It also stains very easily. It gets a burnt smell when you try to push it a bit ..like making a smoothie or shake....it just can't take that kind of use.
2,Close but no banana,"This book really seems to be amongst the many aimed at c++ programmers transferring to Java. I'm not sure why it has the introduction to OO section, if you don't understand that already, you won't get through the book.It introduces a concept one sentence and in the next leaps into a full demonstration of it, without really explaining what the concept is. I'm not a lazy reader who expect stuff handed to him on a silver platter, but there just simply isn't enough information in this book to extract what you need.It's ok in parts, but just moves too quickly, it skips over huge sections, including some fundamental concepts.I'm off to find another Java book to buy."
2,Disappointing,"So, this is yet another coffee table book. See, what it is is that I have a friend who knows I am a NASCAR fan so he didn't know what else to get me for Christmas so he got me 3 NASCAR books. One of them was this one and I was fairly disappointed, mostly due to the fact that the title does not accurately describe the book.See, Daytona Speedweeks is a racing happening. There are a dozen motorsports events, culminating in the Daytona 500. There's a European-style 24 hour race, a motocross event and literally a half-dozen NASCAR races. Check their website!This book, however, focuses primarily on the Daytona 500 (90%) and barely mentions the other non-NASCAR events. In fact, some events it doesn't mention at all. I have no problem with the NASCAR focus, just give the book a different title. This, truly, is a book that you cannot judge by its title.I give this book a ""D"". The title thing annoyed me but there was nothing here about the history of the speedway or of the race."
3,A good good photo book about one week at Daytona's Speedway,"NASCAR has become the greatest spectator sport in America. The top ten most-attended sports events in 2000 were all NASCAR races, and of these races the 500 mile race at Daytona International Speedway is the crown jewel. For 10 days the town eats, sleeps, and breathes NASCAR motor racing. This book captures in pictures the start of the NASCAR season, including the IROC Firebird races, the Craftsman Truck series, the Busch series, and the main event - the Daytona 500 Winston Cup race. Its an excellent photojournal of modern-era racing from the perspective of the crews, the drivers, the fans, and just about everyone else, but like most photojournals there isn't much information about the history of the sport or any other useful reference information. Still, the people who buy this book probably already know the history of NASCAR racing anyway."
3,"Great product, but don't buy online","The product itself, I love it, I use it all the time. No question that product is highly recommended.Lets talk price.At my local Target store I can get a Four (4) pack for $9.49 + 6% tax = $10.06 after tax. Making it $2.52 each.I bought a Two (2) pack on Amazon for 7.99. Making it $4 each.That's a difference of $1.48 each. That's a huge difference. The only reason I bought the two pack on Amazon was because I was lazy. But knowing now that I could save a buck and a half for each of these tablet, I'll wait until I hit the store next time.Again, nothing against the product... just buy it locally next time you're there.UPDATE: I just went to my local Costco, they were selling this for $9.99 for a six (6) pack... definitely buy from your local stores."
2,strong smell,I understand this is a bleach cleanser but i did not expect the smell to be as strong as it was.It is effective as a cleanser but in a smaller bathroom the smell is overpowering.
2,"It does what it is supposed to, but smells bad.","It does clean the bowl well so far, but it doesn't smell like fresh bleach. It smells a little weird."
1,Arrived crushed to pieces.,"The packaging was dented and bent out of shape. In the pack of two, both were crushed into several smaller pieces and minute particles. Useless. It felt as though I was emptying sand into my toilet water."
2,Doesn't really clean,I was expecting to notice a cleaner bowl with these tablets and so far (2 weeks in) nothing has changed. Won't be buying more of these.
5,"Excellent, kids LOVE it!","Have been very satisfied with all RR products. I keep buying, they keep playing. Excellent way to get boys to focus and learn! Highly recommended, makes a great gift too."
4,good video,"well, to be honest is the only Qi gong video that I found and is a good video. after weeks of been using it you can feel the QI moving around your body.I cannot make any coment about fertility improvement because is hard to measure that aspect. but the most important is that is short and is not to many repetitions that can get you frustrate and tire."
4,:itt;e Duck,"My grandson is very happy with this latest edition to his Brain Quest collection . His mother has been using it to lull him to sleep, not an easy task."
2,What a come down!,"Hi, It was not the DVD that I didn't like, but the movie itself. This Author is my favorite and the movie did no justice to her book. Peter O'toole is a great Actor but acted like his heart was Not into this movie. Boring to say the least. I am very disappointed."
5,A Christian Cop's treasure chest.,"Whether this book is for individual, small or large group settings, it offers a self-paced setting to network and reference scriptures for relationships to real world events. The text details both active and retired law enforcement perceptions on daily events and teaches us how to be a better father, spouse, leader, and domestic soldier. This is a must have book for anybody who truly wants to network and study scripture as it relates to real world topics."
4,Cute,"Although not very deep and fairly predictable, this was actually a cute read. The cover had me expecting a little suspense, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. I did love the parts about the cat. I actually laughed out loud."
4,Great story!!!,I really liked this one...it was fast fun and had just enough love without being sappy. It kept me hooked all the way thru...I hope you enjoy this story as much as me!Always a Romantic xoxo
4,A rare type of character,"Edward Sheehan has created a character all too rare among modern novelists: a three-dimensional priest. In a style reminiscent of an older generation of English novelists, Sheehan's protagionist sweeps through six turbulent decades in the Church and the world. The heart of the story is Galsworthy's exploration of what, ultimately, his priesthood means to him. While those who share Sheehan's skepticism about much of what is advertised as ""renewal"" in the modern Church will find a special treat in Cardinal Galsworthy, those who do not can and should savor the richness of the writing and the exploration of Galsworthy's character."
2,Mediocre Hub With Issues,"I've been using this hub for about 6 months now and am looking to replace it. About once a week, it hangs unrecoverably and requires its power cord removed to power it off, then replaced to reset it. In short, it is really a pain, and since hubs like this are a dime a dozen you would probably be better off with an SMC or a D-Link."
2,Bit of a let-down.,"There are virtually no biographies available for A.K. Ramanujan, so I was thrilled to find this article--I'm writing my master's thesis on Ramanujan, and needed some biographical information for it. With that in mind, I purchased this article, or, rather, I wasted my money on it. The article is maybe three pages, tops, and contained the same basic information one can find on Wikipedia. For the money I spent on this article, I expected something more in-depth (for $8 I can purchase a twenty-page scholarly article from JSTOR or Project MUSE).When all's said and done, this piece may be all right for a high-school report, but falls short of higher-level academia."
2,Don't make divinity with it...,The beaters are wire so they aren't good for things that require a little extra -works fine for light-duty use. Making Divinity killed it dead.
1,Over powered and loud,"I don't know what motor they used for this thing but it's ridiculously powerful and unbelievably loud. I'm deaf in one ear and use ear protection when I COOK because I can tell the motor is damaging my good ear. I have had it for one Christmas cooking season but decided I'm going shopping. There is no reason to feel abused by a kitchen appliance. I wouldn't recommend this for any use, except maybe cement mixing. Be sure, though, to wear ear plugs."
3,French alt-rock,"Romain Humeau ""Eternite De l'Instant"" (EMI-France, 2005)This is the first solo album by Romain Humeau, lead singer of the French alt-rock band, Eiffel. Their most interesting album is their first, ""Abricotine,"" which drew a lot of comparisons to the Pixies. Later records (this one included) are more mainstream and unidimensional. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue)"
2,Evening Primrose Oil,I decided to try this brand of Evening Primrose as I have been taking this supplement for PMS symptoms for quite awhile but it doesn't seem to be working quite as well as the other brand I had been using. I chose this one in particular because it was less expensive but I would not buy it again as I question the efficacy of the product. Shipping was quick and I have no complaints about anything else but I am definitely going back to the brand I've used before and have had good results.
2,outdated,Felt the material was very outdated (copyright 1978) and not reflective of current research and practices. It will not be something I will use in my work with dying children.
4,Everything You Need to Know and More,"Brilliant! I've been involved with industrial distribution for well over twenty years. Rolnicki has proven there is still much to be learned, considered and applied. Must reading for anyone that has anything to do with any channel of distribution."
3,Not the ideal choice,"The DS-114EC is Meade's version of the traditional imported 4-1/4"" scope with Meade's new computerized pointing system. As such, it has all the advantages of the latter but retains the drawbacks of the former.A 4-1/4"" reflector is a very small scope to begin with, and the secondary mirror obstruction reduces the light gathering to that of a smaller scope. The computerized mount isn't terribly stable., and you have to be very careful not to set it vibrating when you touch it.When you're spending in the neighborhood of [price], you have a lot of options, one of which is the wide variety of 6"" to 8"" dobsonian-type reflectors available from Meade, Celestron and many other manufacturers. They're more rugged, more stable, and have two or three times the light gathering aperture. Add to that a copy of a good star guide like ""Turn Left at Orion"" and you'll have a package that will deliver more enjoyment for a longer time."
2,STOP BUYING THIS SCOPE,"Look, as an amateur astronomer I can tell you most beginners would be much better served buying a different telescope. While the price may seem attractive for a ""computerized"" scope, the reliability of its electronics are poor, and the optics are below average (the most important part). If you are truly serious about getting yourself or someone else into the hobby, please spend a little more and buy a 6"" or 8"" reflector on a dobsonian mount. This will enable the user of the telescope to actually learn the sky first! Any dobsonian by Orion, Celestron, or Discovery telescopes should do. I hope this helps."
2,Meade DS 114/AT,"Once aligned, the object is very difficult to center. Focusing moves the object out of view...if it locates it. The motor drive stopped functioning correctly after 2 hrs of use. Pretty dissapointing!"
3,Buy it for $122 from Meade... on eBay,"Hello! Thinking of the Meade DS 114, 4.5"" reflector? It's a very good starter telescope, provided you get 1.25"" eyepieces and not 0.985"" eyepieces, and a 30mm finder and not a 24mm finder.Once you get used to the electronic controller, you may want to buy and add (a) an electronic focuser that is operated from the little controller, or (b) a go-to 495 or 497 controller.However, you can get this telescope on eBay for $122 from the manufacturer, meade Instruments. Sure, it may have a scuff on the tube, but it's half price and has a full guarantee.- Canadian astronomer"
4,Pleased with this one,I purchased this telescope 3 years ago for Christmas. I have had many memorable moments with this scope. The only problem with this product is getting parts when one gets broken. Very hard to get a hold of.
4,KEE,"This movie is worth watching.It show how good independentfilms can be. It has a goodplot and few flaws (Key's actingand her not showing more skin).Just don't expect motion picturequality, big companys don't payfor acurrat black caricatures."
1,"Don't Waste Your Money""","This was a awful movie. Bad acting. Very misleading. I saw The Escort and Pandora's Box, and that's why I purchased this one......Big mistake!!!I wish I could rate it a zero."
3,Passable erotic thriller!,"""CSI"" player Gary Dourdan stars as a lawyer whose idea to ""spice up"" his marriage with another female bedmate turns into a nightmare of epic proportions. Made on a shoestring budget (the boom mike makes an un-credited appearance at least twice), the film benefits from a swiftly moving story, credible acting, and Atlanta locations.Fans of ""Unfaithful"", ""Fatal Attraction"", and 60's Ross Hunter films will find something to love (or loathe) about this flick."
1,oh boy,"This has to be one of the worst films that I have ever seen. It was just really bad, bad acting, plot, lighting setting.. I don't want to get into further detail."
3,Worth taking the time to see,"At first, I was somewhat of a skeptic. I was afraid that this movie was going to be about nothing more than just ""SEX"". When you hear men on TV Shows talk about how great it would be to have a threesome I thought, ""oh great, another Springer moment""; however, this movie is just the opposite. I saw this movie as an educational experience. Sure, some people may find being with two people as erotic (and time consuming), but they never think about what may happen after that one-night of carefree sex has been committed. Would you find the experience exciting or just another note to chalk up on your ""I've learned from my mistakes, and I'll never do that again"" list? This is a must see movie for anyone who doesn't take the time to answer that one question that lingers in the back of our minds, ""What will happen once it's all said and done""? The ending is a shocker, but it makes you think."
1,Fatal Attraction Does It Again,"This had to be one of the worst films I saw last year. It was all too predictable. Sure, a movie with a good three-way is usually not to miss, but I would definitely not reccomend this film. Plus the thing that bothered me the most about the film was that it was too much like ""Fatal Attraction"". See that film first, and then see this one and tell me the difference."
4,Three is a crowd!,"I enjoy watching old movies and some independent films depending on the plots and titles. The title of this movie was carefully planned and wonderfully executed. It seems to be one of those ""make you think"" movies. The kind of movie that is on your mind long after you leave the theater. I have been waiting for it to be released to the public because I cannot wait to see it again. This is a must see. It's not a big budget movie but the people behind this film possess much potential. Look to see much from them in the future."
2,Title and Hype are Misleading,"OK. I admit it. I'm one of those who watched this movie hoping to see some skin (Kenya Moore's). But this movie is NOT about a menage a trois. In fact, the anticipated ""menage-a-trois"" bedroom scene is really quite PG-rated -- and quite forgetable.Furthermore, if the title of the movie was more consistent with the storyline, I would have given this movie more stars. What the writers of this movie attempted to do is hook the viewer with a steamy storyline, then switch to becoming a serious movie about abuse, obsession, insanity, etc.The bottom line: If you are buying this movie to see steamy sex -- forget it. This is not that type of movie. But if you like suprise endings -- then this movie is cool.TP"
1,Don't waste the money,"Good intent, poor execution. I bought this dvd ONLY because I LOVE Gary Dourdan. It could have been better, but it's an independent film, so I give it an A for effort. The overall acting is shaky at best. More care is taken to film the sex scene itself, than any other part of the movie. If the same attention to detail and lighting had been taken throughout the film, I would have given it a much better rating."
5,This is one hell of a movie,"What can I really say about the movie Trios? It is one of my favorite movies of the summer. I thought at first the movie was gone be ok but once I really sat down and watched the movie, I was like this movie is STR8 as hell. I don't even remember if they had this movie out at the theaters. After that I seen the movie in the store and had to buy it right away. If u like movies that take twists and turns then you would like this movie. If I could I would give this movie a 10. Have to go and see it if u haven't."
4,been there,I was on the set at Kaya when they filmed the club scene in Atlanta.. I am so glad that this film turned out as good as it did.. I met the director and Gary Dourdan and they were cool. My best friend was an extra in that secene and just being there was an awsome experience for me. The movie gets my thumbs up.
3,Twists and turns,"This movie at first, seems to have a cheezy and predictable plot. The same old perverted husband and submissive wife who's willing to do ANYTHING to please her man even if it means sacrificing her morals. Suprizingly enough, the plot twist that occurs about 45 minutes into the movie will keep you watching as the story ends up being about more than a sexual escapade. For the first viewing it's captivating, but it isn't something that you would like to see over and over again with the cheesy-unrealistic dialouge and the far fetched drama."
3,...,"It is my belief TROIS offers the viewer the bird's eye view into the sexual fantasies of the average man. It also allows the viewer the opportuniry to analyze each characters motives. I really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to any woman whose man has posed the question of expanding their sexual relationship to another level. Kenya Moore, is no Grammy Award winning actress. However, she trys to stay within her character."
2,A Tantalising Piece of - History.,"When Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom decide to spice it up with Eric Banana, all hell breaks loose.Can they manage a troy? What if they didn't use a trojan?"
4,support independent film makers,"This was a pretty good movie. Of course I'm mainly into indepentant black film makers movie products like these. Intersting story line, and the end of movie put me in the middle. One part of me was like ""whoooa"" and took me by surpise, but the result of the storyline was kind of cookie cutter. The music score plus the acting at the end of the movie made up for any other part that you may not like in the movie."
4,ENTERTAINING AFTER SEVERAL YEARS...,"Bought this one a while back and found that I still enjoyed watching it today.A couple of my girlfriends where over this weekend and we decided to watch movies. Since I can watch what I want, when I want...I decided to let them select the movies. When they saw that I had all three ""Trois"" films, they opted to watch them back to back.Once we had watched them all, we sat around discussing quality and content of each. We all agreed that the acting in all of them wasn't the best, but that we enjoyed the storylines, plots and suprises in each.Having been the only one to have seen them prior, I have to admit that they held my attention this time around as well.I recommend this (and the other ""Trois"" films) to other avid movies watchers."
1,Rent this ... don't buy it!!,"I had been meaning to see this movie, and when I discovered I had a free rental at [a video store], I got it. And waited, and waited for the movie to get ""good."" It was good people, with BAD acting. Who told Kenya Moore she can act anyway? Beautiful, without a doubt. Actress, not hardly. Their hearts were in the right place, just that the movie bit the big one. A waste of time. For a minute, I thought I was watching a late-night soft porn movie on Cinemax, where all sex scenes are ""simulated."" The characters were shallow and not convincing at all. Rent it, don't buy it...."
5,FASCINATING,"For those of you seeking credible sources to make sense of issues like terrorism, look no further than Foreign Affairs. With each carefully crafted essay, like Fareed Zakaria's influential report on ""Why They Hate Us"" you will learn about the roots of terrorism and understand the best ways to deal with the challenges that terrorism presents.This collection of essays and articles are brillantly written, thorougly researched, and authored by exteremly qualified policy analysts. Also, unlike many media sources, who increasingly use polemics when presenting a biased view of important topics, these essays present arguments from a variety of angles--which, in the end, is the best way to learn."
2,Fine if you don't like frosting,"There is nothing wrong with the pan itself.....if you need a pan for baking muffins or cupcakes, then I would recommend this one. BUT THE LID is another story....and the lid is the reason I chose this product versus others.So, when I make cupcakes, I like to take them to work. I don't need 2 dozen cupcakes at home, staring me down every day. To transport cupcakes, I need a cover or a lid. So this seemed like a perfect choice. BUT the lid is too short/shallow!! It only works if the cupcakes are not frosted. ANY amount of frosting (even a minimal glaze) will be marred because the lid is soooo close to the top of the cupcakes. And don't even get me started about what would happen if you had fancy 3-dimensional decorations on top, like a piece of candy or other garnish."
3,It 's cheap it broke,The cheap little carrier broke after one month now the handle slides and the baby flips out this is cheap
4,Why couldn't they have made it better?,"First of all, I love how realistic this looks! It looks exactly like the real one. It can teach little kids to role play, without using a real baby seat to look realistic. But, though cute, I wish I had purchased something else The seats screws broke not long after it was purchased. The small peices pose a choking hazard for little kids. This item should be recalled."
3,looks better and bigger on web,"I am 11 years old right now and still play with babydolls.I got this for Christmas and loved it.But over time my doll kept on looking bigger in it for some strange reason and it didn't look that real.I did not like the fact at all that I had to unscrooe the big scroo like things to put it down and up and sometimes they would come loos and fall off.At the end I ended up buying a new carseat that was ment for a real baby at a resale store.And if your waundering what kind of doll I had it was a ""baby annabell"" and I also have a ""baby born"" too! I would so recomend any ""Zapf Creation"" product I had (no) problem with thier stuff."
4,"Oh no, handle knobs broke!",I was really loving this toy until the knobs broke that hold the handles on. Now I am having a diffcult time finding replacements if there is such an animal. Which leads me to hesitate recommending it to someone else. I like the idea and the realistic replica of a real baby travel seat so did my oldest daughter. I am disappointed in the quality of the toy.
2,Screws broke for us too,"Well, my son was 3 when he got this seat along with the stroller/travel seat combo. Perhaps the age range should be raised for this toy. The screws broke for us within the first week of bringing it home, making the seat difficult to carry and very un-fun. It really should have been designed better, and I agree that it should be recalled."
2,COULD DO BETTER,Bought this for a friends daughter. The the pins to use the carrier to go in different positions must unscrew and then set to setting.I origionally was going to buy a Just Born but was a little more in money well wish I did spend the money!Just born is better in the handle it rachets to different postions and in all around product .
2,Grabage,My two daughters aged 5 & 8 received this toy for Christmas. The pins broke amazingly quickly and the product is NOT user friendly. I have not been able to find a web site for Tolly Tots and as such have been unable to replace the pins. Save yourself a headache and your daughters a heart ache and buy a real toy.
5,Great Toy!,"My 3 year old loves this toy! She takes it almost everywhere she goes. We went to my sons baseball game yesterday and everyone was commenting on how cute it is. Definitely worth it!It's durable, fun and cute!"
1,VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT.,"MY DAUGHTER GOT ONE FOR HER B-DAY AND IT WAS BROKEN, WE RETURNED FOR ANOTHER ONE. AFTER PUTTING IT TOGETHER AND IT SAYS THAT IT CAN MOVE IN 3 DIFFERENT WAYS, WELL IT CANT. WHEN SHE TRIED TO MOVE THE HANDLE TO CARRY IT THE END OF THE SCREWS BROKE OFF THAT YOU PUT INTO THE SEAT."
3,Screws,...i got one for my daughter and when we put it together the screws broke .They need to make it more stronger and durable like they make the real ones.
4,A Hard to Handle Carrier,"I bought this because my friend had it. I always loved playing with hers. Then I found this one. My mom ordered it for me. It was alright for the first day or so. Then i began to frusterated with the handle.When you try to change it from car seat to feedind seat, the handle has to come almost all the way off! This is very time consuming. Over all the toy is alright but i wouldn't recomend it to a child with a short attenchen span."
2,Tried the 30 Day Free Trial,"I elected to try the 30 day free trial and abandoned Netbarrier X4 after only a month. It gives a lot of easy to read and reference information. For me, it was scarcely more valuable than the integrated OS X 10.4 firewall. Perhaps I found it less useful because AirPort Extreme is used with my firewall which is set to deny all shared services.By all means, take advantage of all of Intego's free download 90 day trials. In the case of Netbarrier X4, your needs may be different from mine. You may like it.I also use the unobtrusive Intego VirusBarrier X4 to protect my PC friends from 193,000 PC viruses and myself from the two known OSX trojans and four OS X viruses. I am very pleased with it and impressed with the responsive customer service."
3,"Good product, overpriced",This is a nice virus package for the mac. It runs in the background w/o consuming too many resources. It is overpriced for only one years worth of updates.
3,My own fault for not reading the fine print.,After wading through about 60 pages of video offerings on Amazon about trains and not about trains I was surprised to find this video about the last decade of steam and clicked buy immediately. Only after receiving it did I find out it is about steam in Australia. It's OK but I was thinking it would include the last decade of American steam and include my favorite Big Boys and Challengers. Instead it is about a bunch of steam engines I have never seen before so to me just a curiosity. It was spelled out in the ad and I missed it.
1,Not worth your hard earned cash.....,"This book sucks..It is primarily a word for word copy of the Solaris installation manual that comes with every copy of the OS. Except for one detail, the author re-arranged all the step so it is the most confusing this that I have ever read, and I have 4-5 years experience with Unix installs. I do not recommend buying this book. Call your V.A.R or Sun and have them send you the Solaris Advanced Installation Guide instead. You will be glad you did...."
2,SERIOUSLY out of date,Very well written but SERIOUSLY out of date. I gave it away a couple of weeks after buying it and reading Sun's Advanced Installation Guides
1,Ain't it about time,"If the authors decided to look at the sunsolve bugs online, may they might get the hint that the book is out of date.If I had a choice of less than one star ....."
4,From the cover:,"From the back of the book:In this invigorating volume from one of today's leading evangelical scholars, readers will find an introduction that discusses the letter's form, authorship, destination, and primary theological themes, followed by a passage-by-passage commentary that always seeks to answer the question of what the text means for today and what it meant for its original hearers."
1,bad cartridge,"I received this cartridge end of August. As most of us, I don't have to print out too much stuff - so maybe max 100 pages since then. However, the last few print jobs are bad - with streaks and ink powder leaking. I've tried to clean the roller, but after one or two pages, it happens again. The product / box and packing appeared new, but now I doubt this is anything but remanufactured. I have had this printer for 15 years and never had a cartridge that I bought from a brick and mortar store do this."
1,Fake Ad??,The Ad pictures a real HP cartridge but I received a remanufactured cartridge. The seller did accept the return without any problem. ADDITIONAL COMMENT: I noticed that the price of this item has been raised almost three fold since my purchase so maybe it is the real cartridge now.
1,Short And Not Sweet,"After a few months and maybe 50 - 100 sheets this cartridge left streaks and smudges along the edge of the paper. I cannot imagine the printer suddenly failed though I would admit it is a possibility however remote. Removing and resettling the cartridge did nothing. Changing papers did not help. I purchased this cartridge some time ago and use it only occasionally, so this review is well after the purchase fact."
1,"Old stock, not up to standards","I bought 3 cartridges, all were factory sealed but obviously old boxes that had been around for a while. Two were defective out of the box. One had loose toner all over the inside of the box, the other had plastic pieces broken off and was unusable. We returned and received refunds for both of them. I used one of the cartridges and it was fine for a few weeks but now it's starting to cause printing issues with streaks and shadows on the printed copies. I replaced it with a new non-HP brand from one of the big stationery stores.Adorama gave us great customer service on the returns but they shouldn't have sold such old, beat up stock to begin with."
3,"Looks like HP made, but ...","Appears to be HP, but I'm having to shake the thing all the time or it prints light. Maybe it was old or I just got a bad one."
3,Toner cartridge: used as new,"I got it just fine at a good price, but am still trying to figure out why some back spots are printing on my documents just right of center."
5,one dandy pot...,"I've had one of these I purchased locally for about 7 years now and ran 2-4 pots of coffee through it a day. (roughly 9000!! pots of coffee plus espresso and still running strong!) I took w/ me to europe and back where my wife and went to countless coffee shops over the 4 and a half years we were there. It has always made some of the best coffee around (the neighbors came to our house for coffee). Almost as good as the professional machines at shops I went to in Germany. If you're a watery,looking-like tea, one-cup-a-day drinker, then move along and have a cup up sanka you weenie.(it's more than you need) but if you're an avid java junkie and like whipping up your espresso-based drinks, look no more."
1,What a mistake to purchase this product,"I have had Krups products before so when I wanted to own a dual machine I looked up different reviews and picked this one. Wish someone had told me what a problem that would be. First the espresso machine broke after 1.5 months of use!!! I called to get it fixed and even though I sent in the registration card, they have no way of confirming my purchase so officially it isn't under warranty. In addition, even though I live in a major metropolitan area (DC) the closest service center is 1.5 hours away. I am suppose to drive 3 hours to fix a machine that broke so soon? Not helpful and wish I didn't have a broken machine. Waste of money."
4,It's not like I don't know good espresso,"This machine makes good coffee and espresso. Not magnificent, not spectacular, but good. Very good, for the price. It just takes a little know-how and freshly-ground beans to get surprisingly good espresso. Plus it makes good foam. I bought one for my mom as a gift and she's absolutely thrilled with the timer function, she finds it really convenient to set it up the night before and have it just go in the morning (she's not as much of a fresh-ground freak as I am though). The coffee and espresso aren't as good as the local indie coffee shop, but then I don't buy organic shade-grown beans, either. All in all, a good value."
3,"Great coffee, but awful customer service.","I received this coffee pot as a gift Christmas 2001. I love the coffee pot and the expresso maker, and still do. However, in January 2003, I noticed that the automatic function no longer works. I called the Krups 1-800 number. They said they would fix it if I took it to the nearest repair shop. The nearest repair shop is approximately 4 hours from my house. I live an hour south of Cleveland, Ohio, not in the middle of no where.Anyhow, I was told that I could ship the machine to New Jersey, and they would still honor the warranty. However, I have to pay for the shipping and won't have a coffee pot for 4 weeks. Krups sold my parents this defective pot, but does not see this as an inconvenience. I have dealt with customer service for years, and this treatment would never pass in the companies I have worked for.I will probably never buy a Krups again because of this. I have noticed from other reviews that this model has a lot of maintenance issues."
4,"used, dirty, but cleaned up nice","bought a Swiss made coffee/espresso maker with expectations a little high, I guess. No original box, no manual, and right off the counter, used. I cleaned it thoroughly, ran vinegar water thru it 3 times, etc. Now, I like it! Makes great coffee. Works very well, and all the parts were in good order. I recommend this particular Krups model if you are picky about your java."
1,Hated it!!!,"We were so excited when we bought this machine, it was a gift to ourselves and we thought we would end up saving money making our tasty coffee treats at home well.......For the first few months it worked just fine, then it suddenly had all kinds of kinks appear. The espresso maker stopped working JUST when the warranty ran out. No steam and no espresso. The coffee maker still works but doesn't make coffee any better or worse than a cheap coffee pot. The lid on the pot broke after about 4 months. If you don't fit the pot on the heating pad just right you will have a countertop of coffee so you have to stand and watch it start to make sure that won't happen. The timer works fine but because of the aforementioned problem doesn't matter much!!We were very disappointed overall with this machine and I really can't in good conscience recommend it at all!!!! Stay away!!! run for the hills ...seriously!"
2,Leaky Krups pot,"Although this machine made good coffee and expresso, the carafe leaks...so while filling the machine and pouring a cup of coffee, liquid is leaking out the sides. I tried to find a replacement carafe but, there wasn't one to be found that would fit the machine, the caraffe is taller than average. Several times the machine leeked all over the counter...not sure what that was from. Also, the frothing wand doesn't move at all, which means you have to froth where the machine dictates...So, we wasted over $200, getting rid of this after about 3 months use and purchasing something else."
1,Fragile Plastic!,"Everything was great with this machine until the handle on the espresso filter broke off. That is a part whose function entails a certain amount of stress, but when it broke off one could easily see that breaking as it did was almost invetiable due to shoddy design. The place where the handle snapped is the point at which the plastic handle attaches to the filter itself, and thus endures more stress than any other part of the machine, but it is reinforced only with thin plastic. Krups seems to have cuts corners on this model."
2,Broke after 2 months...,"The espresso compressor broke after two months so we had to return the product. The former was hard to use, too, never warm up milk to the temperature we wanted to be.For brewing coffee, it worked fine, but then a normal coffee maker is enough to serve that needs."
2,I thought false advertising was illegal,"I purchased this item to replace my fifteen year old ""Caffe-Presso"" by Krups. This was the closest thing to my old reliable. The old machine provided years of care-free service, but fell off the counter one day and I had also wanted the timer anyway. When researching new machines on-line, this was listed as being made in Europe, but when I brought it home, I noticed on the bottom it read ""Made in China"". The materials are not of the same quality as the older machines; stainless steel has been replaced with plastic or aluminum, and the machine feels much lighter, and not nearly as solid. I don't feel this one will last nearly as long, as the craftsmanship and attention to detail found in the previous model is not present here. I contacted Krups to ask why they advertise the machine as being manufactured in Europe, and received no answer."
2,Espresso Schmesso!,"Recently bought this product after my old machine, a combo like this one, finally gave out after 13 years. Right off the bat the espresso side isn't working. Water goes through okay by itself, but when there's coffee in the filter I only get about 2 cups of product when I poured in 4 cups of water! I'll be calling soon to either get this fixed or to send it back."
1,"Not reliable, not service","Well, it worked real good (not ""great"" but good), but it lasted less than one year. Than it simply stoped working. Still on warantee, but it does not help much since to fix it I have to bring it to San Francisco - the nearest service center to me. So, it looks like I'll have to through it away.This was not exactly my expectations..."
2,Defective product received,"I am totally dissatisfied with the Espresso maker for Krups 867-42 Il Caffe Bistro that I received as a wedding present for two reasons:1) when I pour even as little as 1-2 cups of water it drips water through the system in the amount of 1-2 table spoons. I shown it to friends who have other espresso machines and they comented that they never saw anything like this and I should return the product.2) Also, not sure it it suppose to be this way, no matter how I grind the coffee (thingly or not so) the watter seems to have hard time dripping through but the system produces increadible amount of steem. So from 4 cups of water the espresso maker would create less than 2 and the rest will be just steaming all over the boiler. Not happy at all."
1,Great Compromise,"I've had my 867 for about 5 years. When you can't get to a Starbuck's, and Rockford didn't have one until this year, it's the next best thing. I have some sophisticated dinner guests, and the espresso and cap always get rave reviews.Two tips:1. Use good coffee and grind it fine. You can use espresso grind for regular brewing, but you can't use regular grind for espresso. You'll get brown water.2. Tamp it pretty firmly. The back of the little measuring spoon that comes with the machine works perfectly.I recently completed a serious search of home machines up to $1,500, and concluded that it makes a lot more sense to stay with the Krups than invest in a unit that will require more cleaning and a lot more cash. I wish all my appliances were this good a buy!"
3,Review,"It was a book required for class. The book was not worth reading it, only read it if you have too. While the author makes good points he circles around the points way too much. And he takes way too long to make the points. The shipping was fast, the book is cheap, and it was in good condition when it arrived."
2,GLARING ERRORS,"This book is used for my class in networking at Deakin University, Melbourne Australia. So far we have found that two of the vital mathematical formulae are WRONG, and we are in the fifth chapter. If this were not enough to warrant a damning review, the Authour continually writes knee-deep in jargon, to a point that one wonders if he understands given topics himself. This is particularly noticeable in the second chapter, where he is trying to bring the reader up to speed. The text is being changed for next year because so many students are struggling with it. Try another book. This is the weakest link."
3,I expected more,"Deck shines with his explosive lyrics as always, but musical support is too awfull. Best tracks are ""Cause"" and ""Lovin you""."
2,Not INS at his best.,"On all of the Wu-tang clan albums I really liked Inspectah Deck, but I hate to say this but he sounds terrible on his album. I have been a Wu banger for quiet sometime, and this is one of the worst wu albums I own. The only thing I like about this album is the production."
2,RZA! WHERE ARE YOU!,"This album needs the Rza so bad, I can't even believe it. I love the Rebel INS but after just one listen, I can't listen to this album anymore. I tried to like it, but I couldn't! These other producers need to train under the Rza a lot longer because they are horrible. INS's skills are suffering on this album when put on these weak tracks. The Rza is the only one that can provide the perfect backdrop and tailor the music to each members needs."
2,Fell off hard man....,"Sorry fellas, but I heard INS on Protect Ya Neck and said he was the dopest in the clan. The guy that comes with lyrics like ""I crystalize the rhyme so you can sniff it"" was supposed to hit harder than anyone else out there, but for whatever reason this album fell off hard. 17 tracks on the LP and maybe you can peep 3 or 4 fresh beats. The rest of the album sounds like it was put together by some hollywood studio, not the true dungeon sounds that Wu is known for. Had they followed the formula for earlier success, and had RZA realized that his beats with Deck's words is like peanut butter with the jelly, this album would have gone down in history. Instead, it goes down as one of the biggest dissapointments in a long time. It just hurts, man. When you got easily the number one lyricist in the group, he needs to be heard over the coldest beats they got. That shoulda been RZA."
2,are you kidding me?!!,"this album is straight booty! i really dont see how heads are giving such positive reviews. my only asumption is that there are certain heads so dedicated to the wu that they will not allow themselves to realize when a clan album is wack. weak production, laughable rhymes, it's just terrible!"
2,I was thoroughly dissapointed,"I'm really glad I borrowed the album, cause buying it would be a terrible waste of money. Rather weak beats. Come on Deck! You can do better!"
2,did i just buy the killer bees cd again?,"ins is by far one of the best wu lyricists, but this cd is weak. sounds way too much like the killer bees cd. too much street life, and not enough wu tang."
2,lucky to have 2 stars,Deck is the most talented wu member besides the Gza. Look at this album though. This is not the Deck I know. Track 2 is off the hook but after that the production is garbage. Most of Deck's lyrics after the first song are average. He could have done a lot better with an album that took 2 and a half years to release. Very very disappointing album. I miss the old Deck.
4,Typical Wu and tight.,"Positives: I love Rebel INS. He's a really good rapper. His voice and flow are tight. He's one of the better WTC members. Some of the songs are a little different but most are pretty good. My favorite is ""The Grand Prix"" with U-God and Street Life. This CD is nice to bump when you're just chilling in your room or something. Needless to say, it has good beats on it. Wu almost always does.Negatives: No Method Man feature. I didn't think it was possible for a WTC member to release a solo album without The Ticallion Stallion. Since I'm a huge fan of Meth I think it's cool he's featured on most Wu connected albums. Just disappointed to see he didn't make this one. Otherwise Deck holds his own."
3,RZA!!! Where are You?!,"The lyrics to this album are great, but like the other reviews, the production is weak. The other producers on this album are trying too hard to sound like the Rza, and it's suffering bad. When the Rza left the production boards to the other guys, I've been hurting ever since. I waited for Inspectah Deck's album since the debut of the Wu, but I am very disappointed, and the Rza needs to come back as soon as possible. Only he can make a true Wu-Tang album. I am also sick of Sreet Life's lyrics, he repeats the same things over and over again in all of his songs. The word Wu-Tang used to mean something. It was like a seal of quality on a cd, guranteeing the best lyrics and beats, but this album right here has changed it."
4,Pretty Good,Good solid production good effort good lyrics some standout songs I like Wu Tangs solo efforts and I like this oneLyrics 9/10 Beats 9/10 Good Cd
3,Good Lyrics+Poor Production=........,"If I could, I'd probably give this album a 3.5. The lyrics are nice, but the production is usually boring and monotonous. RZA only produces a couple of tracks here and leaves the rest to a number of producers who seem to be lazy when it comes to making beats. There are good beats on Uncontrolled Substance, such as the Pete Rock produced ""Trouble Man"", ""R.E.C. Room"", ""The Chase"", and ""Word On The Street"", but the rest didn't thrill me too much. Deck's lyrics are top notch though as he destroys fake MC's and even adds some nice story raps such as ""Femme Fatale"". Deck's production is also pretty good. All in all, it's the lyrics that save the album."
3,"It's good, but let's not get too crazy now...","I see a lot of 5 stars for this album. I don't think it's that good. How many of you will play this album in three months?? Probably not most of you. I enjoy the Inspectah's lyrical skills, the beats were not always as tight as I would have liked them, but overall not bad..."
4,Wu-Tang is BACK!!!!,"With disappointing sophmore albums from Wu members such as Method Man, GZA ,and Ol' Dirty Bastard, the Rebel INS comes hard as sh#t with his debut album ""Uncontrolled Substance"". Other disappointments include Cappadonna, and the RZA. In other words, Wu-Tang has been almost garbage since ""Wu-Tang Forever"" until now. The past couple of albums strayed away from the style that made them famous. Inspectah Deck brings it all back on his new album. The RZA only produced 2 tracks, but the other producers have what it takes to master the Wu-Tang style of beats and production. Even Inspectah Deck himself gets behind the boards and recks shop. Those (like myself) who said Wu-Tang had just about fallen off will be pleasantly surprised when they hear the old Wu-Tang comin through. U-God, Ghost Face, and Raekwon are the next line-up of Wu emcees. Let's hope their albums contain more of the classic Wu-Tang feel like their clansman Inspectah Deck."
4,Uncontrolled Substance,"Many felt the Rebel INS aka The Inspectah Deck can lyrically outshine every member from the Wu-Tang Clan, if not, also outshine some of Hip-Hop's finest. Unfortunately the album does not live up to the hype. It feels that the album is missing a small piece that it should have possessed, although the album is still a banger, with cuts like, ""Femme Fatale"" and ""Word On The Street"" along with many others. It may be seen as a disappointment by some due to the lack of RZA-beats that the album has. Yet this album still worth a listen, because after all it is what he says, ""Inspectah Deck's on the set""."
4,Powerful stuff,"Without a single beat by the RZA, Deck still manages to surpass all expectations and forges a new sound from the underground. This is possibly Wu Tang' s best rhymer and joints like Longevity, Friction, and Show and Prove make this official. Witness the power of rhyme and hiphop as Wu Tang steps into the 21st century."
4,tight debut,"People say that after Wu-Tang Forever, the solo projects have fallen. Not with Inspectah Deck. Great lyrics and beats, even though some say the beats aren't up to pare with what it should've been. Out of 17 songs, only 3 come of as weak to me, ""Grand Prix"", ""Elevation"", and ""Hyperdermix"". Tight song after tight song rip on this CD, like ""Word on da Street"", Show n Prove"", ""R.E.C. Room"", ""Longevity"", and plenty of others. I've recenty bought other so-called hip-hop artists,like Juvenile's ""G. Code"" and Snoop's ""Eastsiderz"" and I've resold them because they're weak! Why did I wait so long to pick this one up? In my opinion, since Wu's Forever, only RZA's "" Bobby Digital"" and Meth's ""Tical 2000"" are disappointing. New GZA's, U-God's, Ghostface Killah's, and ODB's were all blazing. Wu haven't fallen off but keep hittin' ya with tight album's that you'll should cop."
4,Wu Revolution,"Yo this album is dope, straight up. But like many others say, RZA's absence is critical to the Wu lyrical Vet. I think that all the beats on this album are good, but no where near a RZA cut. Don't get me wrong, Deck has some Jeep bumpin' beats, but they don't fit his style. But Deck does have some very good songs on this album, and if it isn't a great song, it's a decent song. There isn't really a bad cut on this album. I expect alot from Deck, but only got a half deal. All in all this is a pretty good album, superior to anyu other Wu solo joint."
1,POEM STILL NOT INCLUDED,"As the other reviewer noted, this contains a lot of prose, but none of the poems are included. It is still a total waste of time to download this book."
2,Don't like it,My husband loves the movie and watches it all the time. I bought the book for him. He just read a few pages and said he did not like it.
2,Came in below expectations,"Wonderful idea. Great gift idea for the medical professional in your life. And the idea is just about where it ends. Under amusing and interesting headings there exist a bunch of shorts written by some very well-known authors before they had their coffee, during that hazy intellectual twilight in which you answer fan/hate mail, pay bills, and write quasi-witty shorts for publications that aren't paying you enough to warrant your waking attention. This must be one of those publications. With few exceptions the stories in this book are clever but uninspired. I don't think I've ever seen so many good authors come up with this much meh content in a single volume.I have had this book on my shelf for about three years now and it has not become any funnier so I do not think that it is just me missing something."
3,Good product,"The rice cooker is good for cooking rice for 4-6 people but rice becomes hard & sticks to bottom when cooked for just 1 person. Makes some hissing noise during cooking which wasnt the case of my previous cooker and also needs constant cleaning of the lid, each time you cook. Care needs to be taken to prevent the non stick coating from being removed, like when steel ladles are used to remove rice. Overall it works well at the moment but need to know the state of the non stick coating after some time."
1,Fold This One,"There is a problem with this game: instead of making a game of the fun to watch and dramatic ESPN show, it's a game of the mindnumbingly boring marathon the pros have to endure. Even if you stick with it long enough to get Men the Master or Chris Ferguson to your table - they don't really do or say anything. I didnt stick with it long enough to figure whether the pros are even higher AI than the average player. It's inexuable that the turn and the river come bang-bang, kills all the drama."
1,Endless bad beats on the river,"Yeah, this game is horrible. Not sure who programmed the AI on this game, but come on now.. Runner-runner straight/flush/trips? Every hand that i've been in where I'm all in after the flop leading favorably, the damn CPU always manages to end up winning. Unrealistic AI, shoddy graphics, annoying canned commentary. Could a game get any worse? Holding hope that the WPT or Daniel Negraneu's version is substantially better. Hope they bought the WSOP to learn how NOT to create a poker game."
1,never got the real product,"never got this item,but the company responded quickly to my concerns so i rate the response as 5star."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"My daughter likes it, but she usually goes for other ride-on toys first. We've watched the instructional DVD several times and none of the kids are able to make this self-propel like they claim. Save your money and get something they'll enjoy more.Update: 1/12/2011 - this piece of junk has sat in the garage for the past two years collecting dust. It's been used maybe three times...it just doesn't work as advertised and none of the kids are willing to waste any more time on it. It'll probably go in the garbage this week to make room in the garage."
3,Ehhhh Its ok,"Bought this for one of my kids, because they saw it at the Houston Rodeo and wanted one.It got here and they were excited.They watched the included DVD while I put the bolt in place and tightened it down per the instructions.They took it outside and got after it.The thrill lasted about 3mo tops.All 3 kids decided that their ripstiks were more fun.It is very well made, however the soft wheel material practically vaporizes on our concrete streets. Then you end up riding on bump, bump, bump....Bottom line from my kids: It looks cooler than it really is, and the first time you see someone on it, its REALLY cool...because its different.Current status: sitting in my garage un-ridden in months."
3,trike for kids,i got this for my 7 yr old she likes it but says its hard to learn i been working with her got one my self it does take pratice like learning to ride a bake for the first time i like mine its a great work out
1,Hard to use,I found that this product looks easy to use but is HARD. I would not buy one!!!!!!!! Does not work like they show. very dissapointed!!!
5,Awesome TV,"I've had this TV for almost a year and still completely satisfied with its performance. The pictures on sattelite is so so. DVD pictures are great. But the antenna signals in HD is breath taking. If you plan to get this TV, you should get an indoor/outdoor digital antenna [...] not pay your cable company extra for the HD channel. Try watching CSI in HD with this TV and tell me what you think."
2,Great TV - Service Terrible,"Bought this from Amazon in March 2006. It worked for a few days then died. To make a long story short it took Panasonic 3 months to resolve the situation. They finally ended up buying the TV back. Usually I have had good luck ordering electronics through Amazon, but remember you can't send big TV's back to Amazon even if it breaks a few days after buying (this policy was disclosed when I purchased the TV so I am not complaining about this, only Panasonics Service). I took the refund and bought an LCD TV direct from a prominent computer maker. They have an advance exchange service policy which is a better option for this kind of purchase."
2,Watch out for the big repair costs!!!,"Had this TV for 18 months. Awesome while it worked. Then one day it just wouldn't start and the screen went blank. The red LED would blink 7 times and pause for a couple of seconds and then the 7 blinks continue. You cannot turn it off and I had to unplug to make it stop. Apparently the SC drive needs to be replaced and its $550 to repair. Needless to say, its past the warranty period. Now why did I go with Panasonic instead of a Samsung ? Not to go through this $$$ repairs!! Advice to potential buyers1. Don't fall for the 4/5 stars reviews. Most of them submit them after owning the TV for a few months if not days.2. If you research online you will find that most plasma TVs end up with problems in a couple of years and they are very expensive to repair. Unlike the tube TVs that can last 20+ years the plasma is not there yet.3. If you still want to buy a plasma please get the extended warranty because most likely you will need it because of 2)"
4,Deep Sea adventures,"I bought this game for my boys eight and six. Over all this game is really fun. A little hard for my six year old, but big brother is helping him out. I have had to refur to the game book a couple of times! If you listen to the directions you can get the hang of it! If your kids get mad easy then this is not the game for them! Overall it is fun but really for the older age group of kids!Caring Mom for the Coast"
2,Shamu Snooze,"I was looking forward to a great underwater game, and this really let me down. It is so boring to play. I tried quite a bit, thinking it had to get better, but it didn't. Save your money."
3,D2 doesn't work with Linux,I bought this card from Amazon about one year ago. It worksgreat in Windows 2000 pro. But it is not compatible with linux.I tried both Redhat 7.1 and Mandrake 8.0. The card I got isrevision D2. I saw numerous posts on the internet sayingthe problems with this revision. Revision C1 C2 and C6 shouldbe fine. Not sure about D1 and D3.
5,Excellent. Netgear definately makes the best stuff.,"I got one of these NIC's after getting recommendations from a couple friends. This NIC is awesome. Every bit as good as anything that 3Com puts out for a fraction of the price.Installation under Windows 9x/ME is painless, and it's natively supported in Windows 2000. I haven't encountered a defective one yet, and I have no complaints."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I had two FA-310TX cards and a Netgear FA-311TX had problems with all three. Both of the 310s would stop working after a while - couldn't ping anything or get packets further than the card. The FA-311 started making my machine reboot during online games. Had problems in NT4 as well as Windows 2000. In frustration, I spent a little more and bought a 3Com 3C905 and it's been rock solid. Great price and probably a good card for most people, but I had zero luck with it."
2,Serious issues with later revs,"These used to be some of the best cards to have, back when they were based on the REAL Digital Tulip chip. However, some years ago the Tulip went out of production and Netgear switched to an _almost_ compatible clone chip.The LiteOn PNIC chip that the current cards use has a poor reputation (from what I've read) in the development community. I personally have used dozens of these cards over the past two years and have seen almost every manner of failure. We've had cards that can't auto-neg, ones that never seem to work, and worst of all, cards that will work for weeks and then die without warning. From what I've seen, these things never get decent performance, especially with multiple cards in a system.I have used the FA310TX with Windows 95,98,NT,2k, Linux 2.2-2.4, and Free/OpenBSD. Across every OS and hardware platform I've tried I've seen the same problems, so it's definately not driver or configuration issues."
3,Good Card but stick with 3-Com,"I have bought 3 of these cards. The first one about 3 years ago for the t1 line in my dorm room and its still working. The next two are only one year old and they have already failed.For some reason they refuse to work at a reasonable speed when networked at 100 mbps. Physically the cards look inexpensive and with revision two it seems like they ""reduced"" the cards even more.In addition one of newer cards refuses to work at all while the computer is overclocked even at 140 mhz fsb (from 133, I don't know what this would mean on the pci slot because I don't feel like looking it up).Overall this card is a good inexpensive card for use with broadband. However, I'd rather spend twice as much for a much more reliable, and robust, 3-com NIC."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought 4 of these cards, and each one had a problem on all of my systems. Lock ups, slow transfer, constant freezing, you name it I got it. I ditched the cards and bought 4 Linksys LNE100TX cards to replace it. They work great."
1,Doesn't work with Windows ME,"Although LinkSys tech support will tell you differently, this card does NOT work with Windows ME. And the only help that tech support will give me is that it ""should"" be working."
2,Iffy Quality & Stability. Skip this one!,"I work in Cable Modem operations. We have some customers who buy cheap, and often problematic NIC's, ony to face hours of endless troubleshooting on NIC issues. The NetGear FA-310 is one of their biggest problems. Made of flimsy greenboard and ""? "" type Chinese components, NetGear's crusade of inexpensive NIC's has made a joke of consistentcy. The price may be attractive, yet you would be hard-pressed to find any company who would commit to using NetGear NIC's throughout their operation: Simply because the service and quality is inconsistent. NetGear's customer support is short of laughable, as well.You get what you pay for. From my point of view, I would avoid NetGear, Linksys, or any other ""Off-Brand"" NIC and consider looking for one more dependable. You may pay a little more for a 3Com, Intel, and SMC, but they are worth the price. They offer the consistency and stability every NIC user should demand - Not just a discount price."
3,Easier install driver than the Netgear 311 but...,Netgear packaged the wrong software driver disk with my 310 (they send me the 311 driver disk). I figured if they included the 311 driver there must be a good reason but that turned out to be a poor assumption. After wasting sometime with the wrong driver I got the 310 driver from their site and install was pretty easy from there.It works very well.. I just wish Netgear was a little more careful.
1,Horrible...,"Dead on arrival. No support. Exchanged it for another, still didn't work. Bought a D-Link and I'm now networked."
1,BEWARE!!,"This product is the worst. The first one was broke when I opened it. The second one had no drivers. Tech support is awful as well. Really, don't buy this one..."
3,"good info, wordy at times, but direct and helpful","i gave this 3 stars because of the amount of verbage at times it was wordy and hard to follow, but alot of the info is very straightforward and easy to read. I read the book thru the better part of pregnancy, and enjoyed the style of the write, she seems very genuine and not fluffy in her approach."
5,"High adventure with pirates, Musketeers, and sea battles","This is a great RPG you get to choose from many many new classes that expand the D&D universe into the mid 1600's the age of the rapier and dueling. muskets are the technology of the day and pirates sails the worlds oceans looking for loot to plunder and ships to capture. Burried treasure is to be found and the likes of the Dread Pirate Roberts, Captain Blood, and Black Beard are about along with the dreaded Reis. If your fancy keeps you land bound try your hand and wit at the fights of the musketeer or a coutier or mayber even be a marauding ""North man"" come to plunder the ""civilized"" world for riches, glory, and women. You choose the order!"
5,Great product,This book is everything I wanted to start a pirate campaign in D&D. Great resource! Highly recommended. Lots of fun!
4,Two excellent shorts.,"I don't think NUTTY BUT NICE is very funny. It's tender like CASH AND CARRY, which I don't like. This short is also nutty. I can see how it got it's title. However, the pie scene at the end makes the whole short worth watching.SLIPPERY SILKS is a much better short, or should I say an excellent short. This includes the Stooges first pie fight, even though they really used creampuffs.THE SITTER DOWNERS is another great short. This idea is taken from Laurel and Hardy's THE FINISHING TOUCH, but I think this is better.Overall, a good tape worth adding to your collection."
5,The Stooges do it again... even from the grave!,"This video is, by far, one of the best sets of shorts the boys have ever done. ""Nutty but Nice"" is an adorable little story about a little girl whose father has been kidnapped for a ransom. She gets really distraught over her daddy being kidnapped that she becomes weak, bed-ridden, and depressed. The boys come to the rescue, and her daddy is brought back safe & sound. What a touching little story! I love it!"
5,Great Fun,"We don't own a set of these yet, but my daughter got a set in a discovery pack that she borrowed from the library. She has had so much fun with it that I am planning on buying a set for her this Christmas. Fun! Fun! They are pretty durable and provide unless hours of creative play."
2,Cheap,"It fit over my grill fine but it doesn't secure well. The straps only allow you to tighten it so much so it blows off easy during a strong wind. The material is extremely cheap, reminds me of a $3 walmart rain coat. It tore in multiple places within the first week."
3,Mets Grill Cover...Black or Blue?,"Well, I was happy with the product but due to me excitement upon receiving it, I did not even think about the color. Black is good, but now that I received this alert to review the product, I believe I was oh how should I put it, not exactly given what's in the picture shown. I believe blue is better and I beleive that's what is in the picture. If I had my druthers, I'd druther have the blue Mets not the black. So is it false advertising? Your call. I will have to be more alert next time. I doubt the seller would want to exchange my item now and pay for the return shipping, but if he would I would accept the offer. Thanks for allowing me to express my feelings."
1,Flat hose and reel,"This item is so bad it does not even deserve one star. The reel broke when I dropped it, the hose kinks worse than a regular hose and you have to remove the hose entirely from the reel to use, than thread it back into the slot to rewind. Very time consuming."
2,Very poor reproduction.,"I bought this CD after reading all the positive reviews. If you are an audiophile, don't buy this CD, it sounds like a very low bits MP3 format."
5,Donny Hathaway Live,"I have searched all over for this album. It was one of the few I owned back in the day. A lot of people don't know about Donny, which is ashame. It seems as though the music industry has forgotten his contribution. The man is music. I can't wait to get the CD so my daughter's can find out why I rave about him."
4,donny hathaway live,"Arrived reallt fast, good condition. small crack in case. play back was fine. will buy again from seller"
5,Its Unanimous,"Its obvious from the reviews that the love for this album is matched only by the energy it brings into the room when it begins to play. ""The Ghetto"" has for 30+ years sent chills up my spine as it apparently has around the world. Burning so bright, he couldn't survive his own energy."
5,Live and smokin',"Most peole think of Donnie Hathaway with Roberta Flack and the hits... Where is the love etc. But that ain't the half of it! Donny Hathaway was a genius, right up there with Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. On this album you hear him live, playing electric piano and singing with a killer band featuring Cornell Dupree on guitar and Willie Weeks on bass. You won't believe how hard these guys groove. And the audience knows it. They sing along like a gospel choir! This album is a favourite among my musician friends and, if you like funky R&B, you really must have it!"
4,"Not quite a home run, but good enough",Flex feature is perfect on the Gear Wrenches. Doesn't flop around like some Chinese tools. Ratchet function seems to need more degrees of turn than non-flex models. The ratchet mechanicals feel well constructed (shouldn't be a knuckle buster unless seriously abused).
2,Not as Advertised,This product arrived after a couple of weeks. It was advertised as new but was not in the retail box. It included all parts less manual in a generic box. It was NOT a Krups 872 espresso machine as pictured but a newer model. Could even be a Chinese knockoff. I desired the 872 since I have one and it works great. Newer models have received negative reviews more frequently. I paid $70+ for a machine which retails for less than $60. It seems to work o.k. so I will keep rather than fight seller.
2,WASTE OF $,i gave this a good review a few months ago too soon.well i've had this maker since oct. 2001 and the frother is history.if you are serious about lattes spend the $ and get a good one.
4,"I would have given five, but I have a problem.","I love the machine ! Only problem is when it was given to me, yes second hand, but works fantastic, to part that you put the coffee in for the expresso's is gone. I would love to replace this part, but have yet found it. Any suggestions? Still a good product !"
1,heating coil burnt out twice!,"I had one of these Krups Bravo espesso makers for about two years before the heating element started deteriorating to the point where it took 10 minutes to make a single carafe (4 cups) of espesso...the heating element kept clicking on and off about 5 times before it was finished. This was very frustrating since I use it every weekend and NEED my coffee quickly in the mornings.So, I got a brand new one this past Christmas, the Bravo ""Plus"". ""Plus"" must stand for ""..."" because the very first time I used it to make espesso the heating element worked MORE POORLY that my two-year-old one that I was replacing! It took over 10 minutes just to make one carafe full of espesso! Anyway, I'm never buying Krups again and I DO NOT recommend this specific model. It ... ."
4,"Not bad though,","This a good machine if you want a quick home latte, cappuccino, or espresso fix. The foaming action of this machine is marginal. It does live up to quality you'd expect from a Krups product. I have owned mine for a few years now, and it still fires up."
4,Reliable with Excellent Results,"We have an older model of this machine, the Il Primo. This has been our only espresso machine and has worked, on average, twice per day every day for about 12 years. This unit has performed above and beyond! It produces excellent lattes, which is our drink of choice. It would have been nice to have a frothing pitcher included, but we bought one separately for a few bucks. Sure, the frothing wand needs to be washed out after each use...but who cares? That's 10 seconds of work. I recommend this unit -- Krups makes a durable, reliable product."
4,I like it,"I have never had another espresso maker so nothing else to compare to, however this product is simple to use and makes a great latte.The frother works well and the unit is simple to use.It took me a bit to get in the swing of it though, you really do need to leave the cream in the frother for at least 45 seconds to a minute. And if you want to make another cup right away the filter is hot, but I found if I simply remove it and run it under cold water it cools within seconds.I do not like having to stand there and wait while it brews, but I dont know how else they could have done it and it really is only a couple minutes.But all in all, I am thoroughly enjoying it. Now I can have a latte whenever I want instead of having to run to the local coffee shop!"
1,Can't return it QUICK ENOUGH!,"This product is a load of crap. (sorry to be so eloquent, but it has elicited strong feelings, none of which are positive) We've used an El Cheapo machine from Mr. Coffee for 10 years, and that was a far more impressive product. The Krups Bravo is an engineering disaster. No control over the brewing process; you would need split second timing to make this function properly. And this product has one of the most poorly written instruction manuals I've ever seen. It's going back to the store, it's been in my possession for 2 hours, and that's 2 hours too long."
3,Good book,"I have bought this book recently. Jacques Torres presents a very beautiful book with good and surprinsingly creative recipes (some of them too sophisticated). But I think it is not a must, and not for beginners."
5,Fantastic,There will always be one and only one Jacques Torres.I love this book actually made a few recipes from here.Its not everyday type of deserts but true masterpieces. Can you tell I am one of his biggest fans.I truly miss seeing him on food [...]
3,"Good, But Needs More Description","I wanted to love this book, but instead I only liked it. I'm a huge cycling fan, so it seemed natural that I would fall in love with one of the greatest fiction cycling stories ever written, right? I don't know if the magic was lost in translation or if the story was just simply too minimal for my liking, but I was never able to immerse myself in the story. I need more physical description than what was provided. I spent much of the book kind of floating in outerspace somewhere. I knew I was reading about a bike race, but there wasn't much to keep me tied to imagining that race. I liked the concept and it's worth reading, especially if you love cycling, however the English translation is a bit rough at times. Maybe my expectations were just too high.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman"
3,A tour de force of human neuroses,"Cycling fanatics will find great pleasure in this literary cult classic. The author clearly knows what it's like to be a competitive cyclist, and he does an exceptional job of revealing what goes on inside the head of such a person. This book is as much about the athletic psyche as it is about a race. And that's what makes it so interesting. Anyone who has competed in any kind of race, especially a distance race, will be able to relate to the often bizarre, irrational thoughts that one's mind produces. Krabbe's anecdotes about inventing words in his head to keep himself amused during training rides, or telling himself repeatedly that his lowest climbing gear is clean as a whistle, are just two examples of the intimate psychological glimpses that readers will surely enjoy. I think the point of the story is that you have to be just a little bit crazy to be a professional cyclist, but at the same time, the cyclist's neuroses are completely human and natural."
5,killer book,"the seminal book on amateur bike racing...gets you right inside the head of a competitive cyclist - awesome for a guy who loves to ride and wants to get a good insight. now, i need to go for a ride."
5,great real racing book,"this book was great for anyone who races bicycles. the book was very well written, and was really about the old school of racing when you had to shift on the down tubes..and no radio communication in the races."
3,What did he say?,"After all the rave reviews I thought the book could not miss. At times it was difficult to determine if Krabbe was speaking English. The English is typical european intrepretation with an attempt at humor; a recipe for boring reading. It had its moments where any cycling junky would get off, but few and far between. By page 25 I wanted my money back."
3,"Great concept, great insight, but the execution...","I know I am the minority here, but I just can't rave about this book. I love bike racing, love tactics and all of that, but something just didn't click for me with this one. In my opinion, it wasn't worth the money."
3,"Only 3 stars, and I'm being polite !","I had high hopes for this book, and truly felt it deserved only 2 stars. However, since there are not many cycling ""novels"" on the market, I felt compelled to issue a 3 star rating.Just like the perennial movie that wins ""Picture of the Year"", and you shake your head and ask, ""WHY""...this is no different. Granted, the author does offer the reader an occasional, brilliant passage or two that perhaps only a seasoned cyclist can directly relate to, but those are much too few and far between.What's between is a mix of strange writing dialogue that...quite often... not only doesn't make sense, but he tends to bounces back in time to previous stories, and it gave (this) reader a bit of difficulty in not only following the intended story at hand, but staying focused enough to finish the book.Rather disappointed."
5,I can't imagine how it could be improved,"Though I'm not a racer, I'm a randonneur (ultra-long-distance cyclist) and novelist, and I can't see a way this book could be improved.I haven't made a point of exhaustive reading about cycling, but what I've read generally seems to have been written by riders with a good command of language. THE RIDER is in a different category. Its first-person voice is that of a top-shelf novelist in complete command of his art, exploiting a deep and complete knowledge of his subject that can only come from experience and a true love of the race, not from even the most rigorous research.I can't think of a book in that genre that more deserves to be a classic. THE RIDER is intelligent, sharp, tough, and visceral. Get it."
4,"fun, quick read","Run, quick read. Great book for any cyclist. I could relate to some of his stratedgies as he was going thru the race and his feelings of praying for a mechanical. The book tends to jump around a bit, think ""Lost style"" flashbacks. This book will get passed on to some friends in my group ride for sure. One of the best cycling books I've read, still like Obree's book best though."
4,Riding with the Rider,Good writing style. I felt as if I were the rider myself in those competitions. Good inspiration for me as a beginning road cyclist. I also own Lance Armstrong books. Strongly recommend on this one. Fun and Knowledge filled writing style.
2,One of the worst books I have ever read...,"I read this book becuase someone compared this book to books written by one of my favorite authors, Chuck Palahniuk. Well, I started reading, and, although I tried, I just could not enjoy it. I mean, absolutely nothing happens in these stories: characters don't develop, there is no action, nobody goes on a journey, absolutely nothing happens. These stories read as follows: a guy gets up, he goes to the store and buys milk, he walks home, he has a bowl of cereal. That's all that happens in most of these stories. Perhaps I'm missing something, and perhaps there's something I don't know that would make this book make sense, in which case, I apologize for this rant. But really, if you like reading books where stuff happens, then I'd skip this one."
2,A disappointment,"We wanted to buy the B&D ""ergo"" electric knife, but we could not locate one in time for Xmas, so we bought the EK800.The first time we used it, the knife sliced a standing rib roast into beautiful thin slices. The second time we used it (on a baked ham) food stated slipping in between the two blades. This is the problem with the EK800, the slicing blade is actually two thin blades that sort of lock together. When we attempt to slice meats, thin slivers of meat get in between the two blades, making slicing impossible. We thought it might be our ""technique"", but we tried it on several more roasts nd no matter how we use it, food gets between the blades. It's too late to return it, so we'll keep it for slicing homemade bread, but we'll be looking for another electric knife for carving meats."
2,Not as expected,"This knife was a great idea! The knife cuts great, but the guard is so flimsy you still need alot of skill to cut your bread slices evenly. The guard bends too easily and once you've cut one slice uneven it's hard to get it back on track and cut the rest of the slices uniform. Guess I will have to keep practicing or go back to the good old plastic guides!"
3,need Portuguese,"This book is only as funny as the review promises if you speak Portuguese - otherwise you can't tell what they were translating FROM. You only get half the joke. Also, I have a friend who speaks Portuguese and she says the Portuguese in the book is archaic, as well."
2,Not funny.,"Maybe it's the fault of the internet, a medium seemingly designed to expose the user to the worst possible grammar and spelling. Possibly it's the fact that I speak only English; if I was a speaker of Portuguese, I might have enjoyed this more.The joke, ""Look at this phrase: Isn't it bizarre?"" is repeated hundreds of times. Keeping in mind that it wasn't authored to be a humorous book does give one a chuckle, as does the background story, but that means the back cover represents the best of the book."
4,What is there in new's litterature?,"If you want to know how to insult your hairdresser or avoid buying a really bad used horse (either in English or Portuguese), then this is the book for you. The the proper terms for ""chastisements"" (""the iron collar,"" ""the torture rack""). Learn some familiar phrases (""These apricots and these peaches make me and to come water in mouth."") Why don't they write books like this anymore? ""There is a reason for that, it is that you cannot to sell its. The actual liking of the public is depraved they does not read who for to amuse one's self ant but to instruct one's."" This is a book to read for to amuse one's self."
2,soynut butter,Not as good quality as other brand (I'm healthy brand) that I have tried. It seems to seperate more than the other brand.
4,Here's a book to help you regain your Quality of Life!,"Here's a simple yet outstanding guide of interdisciplinary quality living practices.Many of us may have heard some of this before but forgot, or never learned the practices with enough depth to help us for very long.Each of these practices have in common what the title promises: Increasing our energy.When we find something lacking in our Quality of Life, don't we often attribute at least part of it to a lack of energy?This little compendium will help us remember and put these practices back into our lives, and therefore put Energy back into our lives.I liked the book so much after it was loaned to me, that I just bought my own copy here at amazon!"
3,Tea and cookies,"A good read for people who enjoy an eastern theme to their fantasy -- A pleasant, mild flavored story, quiet and a pleasant diversion but not intensely gripping.The main character grows through the book, in slow measured steps as the reader is treated to alternating chapters of her current adventure and a retcon of her training to become a Paper Mage. The use of paper magic is delightful, and the world building is interesting and full of well molded characters, but without great depth to any character outside Xiao Yen, who's POV most of the story is seen from.Warning, one scene of gang rape. Dispassionately described, mostly ""off screen"". Otherwise it's a nice read to pass the hours on a quiet afternoon, with a hot beverage and a sweet. Would make a good intro for futher adventures of Xiao Yen."
1,Paper is appropriate,"Paper is appropriate in the title, the characters are utterly 2 dimensional as is the story. Painfully dull with nothing to interest you in any further interaction with the characters. I kept waiting for the good part and it never got there. While parts of the book seemed to foreshadow greatness, it simply never developed. The heroine is an utter turn off, by stages either seeming oblivious or dense. The writing leaned toward poetic and could have set off a better story well."
2,"Good idea, bad book.","While I agree that this book is a bit different from other fantasy novels, I think Paper Mage was far from perfect. There's more to a book than just an idea. That's the only reason this book gets two stars from me instead of one.With the exception of Xiao Yen, the characters were very flat. There was some attempt at developing Udo and Wang Tie-Tie but they still ended up feeling like cardboard cut outs.Each chapter skipped back and forth between past and present. Not too original and not necessary. The plot, though initially interesting, skipped around a bit too much. It was more like several short stories linked together. So much more could have been done with this book."
2,mediocre characterizations,"The basic plot has already been outlined so I won't repeat it. Overall, the concept is good. However, the heroine was poorly developed as were the other minor characters except for the wicked aunt. She was the only character in this novel that was anything other than bland. Very disappointing overall. For other books based on Chinese culture, I suggest Bridge of Birds (Hughart) or Tea With The Black Dragon (McAvoy). Both very well written with complex characters."
4,Creative and Interesting,"Thoughtful, interesting, and creative. Not an action-packed book, but a story full of fantasy and beauty."
3,Not Gann's best - but OK,"This isn't Gann's best written book, nor his best story. Get a copy of ""Fate Is The Hunter"" for a REAL aviation book - - and then you must read that from cover to cover in one go.""The Aviator"" grinds an ax, has a weak plot, but would be good during jury duty I suppose. Gann's war action fiction is what made his name in literature. He WAS a top-notch flier for decades, so he knows about and has flown all the planes he writes of. This one's story line is lame.Other Gann books of note (besides the ones Hollywood made into movies) are ""Gentlemen of Adventure"" or ""In The Company of Eagles"". for a real change of pace read also ""Song of the Sirens"", a book about Gann's other passion, tall ships and sailing."
3,Not typical Gann,"Unlike prior Gann books I've read, this story is more about the influence a young girl has on the life of a lonely aviator of a downed plane than it is about the adventure itself. Set in the early days of airmail, the pilot agrees to carry as a passenger in the unheated mail compartment of the plane a young girl. The pilot lives a lonely life, and at first there is no real concern for the person of the girl.After the plane crashes in a remote area, their fate becomes the same. The pilot's concern for the girl grows. We witness the actions that result from their concern for each other's safety as they try to find their way out of the wilderness in winter. By the conclusion the pilot has opened his heart to emotional connection.It is a fast read, but when you pick it up be aware that Gann is exploring a different area is his writing. I think it makes the point of the loneliness of the early pilots, but in a roundabout way that I didnot find that appealing."
5,This Regency has everything!,"Wit, humor, suspense, sweet romance...this book has it all. I have read six Cindy Holbrook Regencies. Lady Megan's Masquerade and The Country Gentleman were wonderful. Some of the others were not as well written. A Daring Deception was my favorite. It had several subplots which kept me turning the pages. I was surprised to pick up a short Regency romance and find that it was such a complete and satisfying book."
2,...,"You know, I was expecting schemes of where you should hit and detailed photographs of the moves. Instead, you get about 6 pics of an entire kata.I found of the katas in youtube, performed by himself, and the whole picture sequence doesn't remotely resemble the actual kata he performs.I'm an experienced fighter (TaeKwonDo, Knife Fight and Krav Maga) and could not make sense out of it. He shows you the end of the move, that's it. How you go from one move to another you should figure out yourself, and sometimes there's whole arms turns, body turns etc... Things you can't see in the photographs.For the content of the book: Excelent.But for the content itself I recommend his "" The Main Meridians (Encyclopedia of Dim-Mak)"", much move informing."
1,Don't even think of buying this book. Total BS.,"I have 17 years of experience in martial arts, including experience in Kyusho-Jitsu (pressure point fighting). This book is a total waste of money. This guy is a joke because he even doesn't know about simple cycle of destruction between five elements, which is the most important part in pressure point fighting."
4,Fun for Little Fingers,"It is true that none stand except Scooby and a couple can sit well and the others not (oh, and I also know since the are my child's bathmates too that some float and some don't). Yet, the arms and legs bend on all of the characters and they have been my daughter's constant companions for over a year. She has a ton of fun role-playing with them. She has carried these everywhere (and the traditionally-clothed set of the same). They are the perfect size to tuck into a purse or pocekt or go for a ride. They play well in Barbie's house, always on their best manners and get along quite well with all of the Teen Titans people. If your child is a fan of this series and especially if they are into imaginative play and smaller hand-size toys, they will surely love these too. Once they do fall in love with their new friends, buy a second set for safe-keeping. (and if you ever see Daphne at a rest stop in Georgia, please let me know; we've been missing her)."
3,Fun with some problems,"I got this set the other day and here is what i noticed. the box is very collector friendly it is square with a mystery machine graphic across it with a window in the center. There are no twist ties inside and everything can fit back in well. on the yellow cardboard behind the plastic holding the figures in there are bios of each character with last names addresses and ages (all but shaggy are 16, he's 17 and scooby's 7). The figures are well sculpted and niceyly articulated but there is one glaring problem, the feet on these figures are not made for standing. they are not flat on the bottom (except scooby's). While some figures can be balanced in a standing position with some effort, others it is almost impossible (ironically fred and daphne). So these look great in the package but in my opinion thats about it"
4,Great Combo Gift,I purchased this set along with Mystery Machine Ghost Patrol for my 4 year old grandson. I highly recommend purchasing them together. He just loved both sets and plays with them alot.
3,Fair,"I was disappointed in the book. It does contain good information on setting your goal of marriage and developing the profile of the man you want to be with, but these topics have been covered as well in magazine articles and other books I've seen.There was a lot of concentration on a few couples' experiences and I found the men from those couples to be atypical to those I date (more new-agey than men I know or would want to know). I also was taken aback by the author seeming to go out of her way to mention that her subject couples ""married within their race"". I think if I'd browsed this book in a store I'd have left it there."
4,Great,My mother bought me this book last year and I'm getting married this summer...haha...not sure if it had to do with the book or not :)
3,not bad,The collection of stories is not bad. Sherrilyn Kenyon's contribution is the best.. not nearly as stellar as Harriet Klausner's review.. anyone else ever notice that all her reviews are 5 stars?
3,"Not perfect, but pretty good.","""Romance"" as a genre often sacrifices plot and character development to relationship and sex, and sometimes I can get very annoyed reading some of the popular authors. I feel Sherrilyn Kenyon is better in her paranormal world than her secret agent world. If you can accept the premise of Nicole Camden's ""The Nekkid Truth,"" it's a better story overall. For me, the strongest and most intelligent while still very sexy entry was Liz Carlyle's ""Let's Talk About Sex."" I bought this book because I have a weak spot for cops. It's safer reading and fantasizing about them than dating them and worrying about them and getting stood up over and over because of overtime. In real life, these poor guys often don't have time and energy for romance and sex. We owe them a lot!"
3,mixed bag,"first one, kenyons, was contrived and superficial. second one was passable... but the third one was the only one i would read again. would have paid willingly for it, but not the first two."
1,"So ""Bad"" I Returned It","I purchased this book because Sherrilyn Kenyon is one of my must have authors. I was unbelievably disappointed with this book. I didn't even finish Ms. Kenyon's story, and only skimmed the others before sending it back. There is nothing in any of them to capture your attention."
5,HOT HOT HOT,"THIS BOOK WAS SO HOT IT BURN'S. :) I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. SHERRILYN KENYON BAD TO THE BONE WAS HOT. SHE JUST KEEP'S THE HOT AND SPICY STORY'S COMING. I HAVE READ ALL OF HER BOOK'S. AND LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM. AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT ONE. AND AS FOR LIZ CARLYNE'S LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX. (THE NAME OF THE STORY SAY'S IT ALL) THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE READ ANYTHING BY HER. AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB. AS GOOD AS SHERRILYN. IF SHE KEEP'S WRITING LIKE SHE DID WITH THIS ONE. SHE WILL BE SET. AND FOR NICOLE CAMDEN I THINK HER SHORT STORY WAS GREAT. AND I WELL BE READING HER NEXT BOOK JUST TO SEE IF IT IS AS GOOD AS THE NEKKID TRUTH. WILL WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. WELL, I HOPE THAT I WAS HELPFUL. BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THIS BOOK IS SO HOT AND SEXY IT SIZZLE'S............. HAPPY READING :)"
4,Size matters,"I ordered this Hayes 6 oz fuel tank to replace a Great Planes 6 oz fuel tank that I had in a model airplane. I figured they would be interchangeable, but when I got it, I found out the Hayes tank was about 1/4"" longer. Because of this, I could not fit it in my airplane. Otherwise, the product seemed fine. I'm getting a Dubro tank, which is a bit shorter."
3,Bunn filters,"I got these filters because I have a Bunn coffeemaker. The coffeemaker causes the coffee to spill over grocery store filters. This filter is taller and I thought it would take care of the problem but I still have to use a filter on top of the grounds to cut down on the mess. Sometimes this works, sometimes not. Not sure what can be done to prevent this mess but this filter is not the answer, by itself. I will buy these again, though. They are the tallest filters I have found."
4,Work nice...,this are really nice give my coffee a great flavor... I love my coffee maker it makes great coffee and these fit good in it...
4,Not much to say,Not much to say. It works well and is easy to use. Doesn't break when it gets wet and all around a good product
2,a bit too short,"Have been using these filters in my Bunn, but these little fellers are only 2 1/2 inches deep, allowing coffee grounds to pour over the top into the pot. If you use these don't make a full pot!"
5,Nice,Works well. Use it mainly for hot water during large group gatherings. Have had no trouble with this item and would recommend it to other customers. Thank you.
3,$5.08 Are you kidding,"Without reading every single review, I am confident that someone has already stated this: I buy this 100-count Bunn coffee filter box at Target or Walmart for $1.00 and they are always available. Now, someone please explain why anyone would buy a box of these for $5.08 on line when i can buy them at Walmart or Target for $1.00........Hope someone responds because either I am missing something or this is a rip off."
4,These are good,"I don't see that much of a difference between the Bunn filters and the regular size filters I bought at the grocery store. They are a little taller and there's slightly less overflow of the coffee grounds. My husband, who makes the coffee more often than I do, likes these a lot better than the regular brand so we'll probably continue to purchase."
3,Same as the reusable filter,"The Bunn coffeepot was a Christmas gift for my son, but it did not resemble the hype about it, so this accessory is not needed."
3,Exactly what I wanted.,"These coffee filters are exactly what I was looking for. Yes I don't use a single (waste of money) cup machine. I grind beans, put them in filters, and run hot water over them. These filters help me achieve my goal: a fresh cup of coffee. Like all paper coffee filters, you may have to double up on the filters, but thats just the way it is when you use a coffee drip apparatus from the 90's. I give these 3 stars because they are the AVERAGE filters that are (were) ubiquitous in every persons' home."
5,Jack Mc,I put BUNN BCF100-B 100-Count Basket Filter in my Perma-Brew Re-useable Coffee Filter I find it is a easy way to clean up after the coffee is madeYou just empty the Re-useable Coffee Filter in the garbage
1,Not My Bunns,"I have owned these filters and the Bunn Velocity for over a month. Have decided I prefer cone type brewers to the basket brewer. These are unusually thick filters designed so to withstand the spray from the spray head in the velocity brewer. I think they are inferior to the goldtone basket, which is the only filter I use to get a decent, not great, cup of coffee from the Bunn Velocity brewer. I originally rated the brewer a four but would not buy it again. I even bought a French press after buying the Bunn brewer which I use on the weekend. The brewer is okay just too expensive given the average brew."
1,Too tall,"I suppose if you have a Bunn coffee maker this is a fine product. I mean, it's coffee filter, so there's not many ways to screw it up. Well, there's one way: make it too tall to fit in anything that's not a Bunn coffee pot. If you're just looking for coffee filters, look elsewhere."
2,No difference,These filters are exactly like the ones you can buy at any grocery store for 99 cents per pack.Save your money and get em at the store.
1,I received the wrong filters.,"Received basic white instead of the brown filters I ordered. Your program insist I give it a star in order to move on, so the one star is not deserved.Eleanor"
5,Great,No more coffee grounds in my coffee.Made purfec Cooke every time now.Iwillalways use bunn filters every time I make a cup of coffee
5,Do Their Job,"Bought these to match the new coffee maker purchased same time. Easier than driving to a store, and less expensive !"
5,good value for hard to find coffee filter,These are the real thing and work as they should in my Bunn Phase Brew coffee brewer. This slightly taller size used in Bunn machines is not generally found in grocery stores and the generic Mr. Coffee style filters fit but the sides are too low. I will continue to order these as I need them.
5,Only filter that works well for Bunn Home Pots,"We love our Bunn Brewer (actually on the second one... first one lasted for years and finally burned out).This is the appropriate size filter for a home Bunn Coffee Brewer. Generic or other name brand filters are too short and result in grounds in the pot -- so it's well worth the extra money to get genuine Bunn filters. I used to be able to get Bunn filters at Walmart and Publix but no more (why?), which is frustrating. After doing a bit of research I discovered that if you have the space it's actually cheaper to buy directly from Bunn. For a box of 1,000 filters (equal to 10 individual boxes of 100 shown here)the price, including shipping and handling, comes down to aprox $1.80 per box of 100 -- which is a bit more than I was paying at Walmart but half the price I was about to pay here."
4,Great price!,"As expected, the Bunn filters work great with our Bunn coffee maker. They took a little while to get here, but for the price, it was a great deal."
1,Ridiculous.,"Can't believe that you are charging $4.12 per 100 ct. box when Walmart sell the same identical item for $.99 This is their everyday price as I have been purchasing them, at this price, for several years. Better check your price on this item, Amazon!!!"
3,Works but 4X the price!,"I bought these last week here for $4.08 per 100 - Yesterday I found the exact same filters at Farm & Fleet for 98 cents per 100. We were having a problem with overflow (a common problem with using regular store bought filters)and these filters take care of the problem, Which I why I gave them 3 stars, but charging 4X what they are worth is scandalous! I'll be stocking up at Farm & Fleet, not here!"
3,Great Product but this price is too high.,These are the only filters to use with a Bunn coffeemaker however this price is incredibly high. These are available at a certain chain that starts with a W for .97 cents.
5,A BUNN must have,"If you have a BUNN you know how hard it is to find the right fitting filter, especially if you run out of these. The generic ones are usually too big or too small and finding this particular filter in my local stores has been very difficult. On the rare occaision I do find them, they are over $5 a box! Being able to purchase them here on Amazon has made it much easier to keep them in stock. When I see that I'm running low I just add a box on to my current order.Currently being used with theBunn A10 Pour-O-Matic Coffee Brewer."
3,A Bit Pricey,"You will have to decide if it is a value for the money versus using regular coffee filters, since these are quite a bit more costly. If you do not want to ever have any coffee grinds in your coffee, then you will probably want to buy these regularly since they are taller than regular filters. If occasionally finding them in your coffee is not a big deal, you may want to opt for the regular filters from the local grocery store."
3,Okay,"I have not used these filters as of yet. Have used the permanent basket. Shall keep these on hand, just in case. Of course, I could use them when I brew tea."
5,Perfect fit for our coffee basket,These filters are the only ones I've found that are tall enough to perfectly fit the basket of our Bunn coffee maker. They're easy to use and the grounds stay in the filter rather than in the coffee!
4,Filter Fracas,"I am very fond of the Bunn Coffee maker. The extra large filters work just fine, but now we are locked-in to them. Yeah, I know I can always use available smaller filters or a permanent filter and only pour in half the water, then wait and pour the rest,but the price of forgetting - early in the morning - is grounds in the coffee or overflow on the counter and floor. This also gives Bunn a large edge over other filter makers on sales of their proprietary sized filters. Time to look for a restaurant supply company."
3,"taste is everything, so Krups Charcoal Filters, Set of 2","don't wait too long, these are key if you want good coffee. simple and long lasting. now i only wish the coffee maker was better designed."
1,Dont waste your money,Krups Coffee are just total Junk... dont waste your money. Not sure if the filters work but the coffe pot stoped working after 30 days
3,Krups keeps on brewing,These are the correct filters for my 1996 Crystal Clear arome coffee maker that just won't die.
5,Great Find,Can't find these coffee water filters in the store anymore. It's great that they are so easy to order online!
3,over priced,"These filters fit the product well and do their job, but they are way over priced. I went ahead and bought them since my coffee maker requires them and the economic situation has not yet closed over my head. I do wish, however, that the manufacturer would take a second look and consider a more fair price."
2,Waste of Money,"Try simply not using the filters. My coffee tastes just as good without it. Maybe my water is already clean, but this seems like a ploy to make Krups customers keep paying. The price is outrageous! A little package of activated charcoal should NOT cost $5 a piece."
5,Justice will be Served,"Outstanding movie based on true events. Ally Sheedy is great as Jane a woman who devotes 13 years bringing her aunts killer to justice. Sean Patrick Flanery is perfectly cast as Jane's long time friend turned lover. Handsome, charming and totally convincing as Tom O'Donnell. Meat Loaf is the surprisingly effective casting choice for Jack Morris, the cold case detective that never gives up. I was riveted watching this movie and the coming to terms that such a good looking, seemingly moral man might not be what he seems to be."
4,"nothing fancy, but works.","Nothing fancy, but if you want a single cup of coffee this works great. I've had it for about two months and have had no trouble working with it. Will not work with finely ground coffee, the filter will overflow, but this is typical for many coffee pots I've had."
1,Don't Do It.,Mine shorted out and produced a unpleasant smelling smoke as soon as I plugged it in. It went to the trash. I still use the travel mug.
1,doesn't work,I thought Black & Decker was a quality brand and I have bought their products for years with only positive results. Until now. The coffee maker seems to be constructed of cheap materials. It is unstable . The top doesn't fit properly. The exit of liquid from the filter to cup drops all over and out of the cup But the real problem is that the thermostat is faulty. It only heats a couple of ounces and cuts off. In order to make a complete cup of coffee I had to reset the switch six times. The only positive of this item is the nice travel cup. Too bad that it has rubber parts and is not microwave safe
4,COFFEE EASY,"THIS COFFEE BREWER IS LOW MAINTENANCE. I HAVE OWNED ONE BEFORE AND IT MAKES GOOD COFFEE. AS FAR AS THE TRAVEL MUG....THE STAINLESS STEEL ONE WAS A LOT BETTER. STOP MAKING THINGS ""NEW AND IMPROVED"" BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK.. NOT FOR ME ANYWAY"
1,Not satisfied with this product,This product was exactly what I was looking for. You can not purchase one cup coffee makers like this in stores so I was happy to find it on Amazon. Unfortunetly this product stopped working after 3 weeks. It only produces a 1/2 cup of coffee with the remaining water still in the unit. Would like a refund. I would not recommend this product.
1,Do not buy!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this for my husband for his birthday and unfortunately it only worked for about 5 cups of coffee and now it won't work at all. My husband believes the thermostat keeps shutting the machine off. It was very disappointing, and for someone who does not order online much this does not make me want to do it again anytime soon. I only gave the item one star, I would have left it blank but that wasn't a choice."
1,Quit working after a month,"Was a decent coffee maker, until after about 35 days when it quit working altogether. Buy at your own risk."
4,nice little coffee maker,"This is just perfect for one cup of coffee, when you don't want to make an entire pot. It doesn't take up much space and the permanent filter is nice. I hope it lasts, as I have had other black & decker appliances that didn't last as long as they should have. But the price was right. Fast delivery too."
5,Loving this little pot,"I already had one of these pots and left it at my second home. I wanted another for my full time residence. I do use a large regular cofffe maker each morning, but there are nights I want a single cup of decaf and this is perfect. The permanent filter makes it easy and inexpensive. I also have guests occasionally that prefer decaf in the morning, so I can just make one cup. It is small and easy to use for travel as well."
3,Brew n Go coffemaker,"I chose 3 stars because the product is fine, just that, fine. It works, no heater to keep warm, only brews 1 1/2 cups which I may have noticed if I looked closer. Good if you like to grab your coffee and hit the road. No pre-sets to brew before wakeup, boo!"
1,Boo,This coffee maker started leakin like about a week after I got it don't buy this item unless you don't care
5,i've had mine for years,"i really enjoy my b&d coffeemaker. i've had it for years and i've never had any problems. easy to fill and quick to brew. the coffee is at the right temp (hot) and the coffee mug it comes with has been very durable. i have 2 dolce gusto's (1 at home, 1 at work), but honestly i enjoy this inexpensive machine because i can buy any kind and brand of coffee and use it. if you're looking for a great reliable, easy to store coffeemaker, this is it."
1,Brew 'N Go Coffeemaker,"It's necessary to depress the on switch up to 4 times to get a full cup of coffee brewed. with the other on I bought the switch stopped working in less than a couple of months, and that was just a few months ago! 9 You can check your records for dates of purchase.)This is the second Brew""N Go coffeemaker I've bought from Amazon in the past few months. Previously. I've had one for years, and really enjoyed a good fresh cup of coffee in a few minutes: it is with the last two that I'm am extremely dissatisfied and will never purchase another one! I guess I'm a little slow, as it has taken two brand new bad ones to reach that conclusion!"
4,Great one-cup coffee maker,"This single-cup coffee maker is, in my opinion, 8.5 on a scale of 10. It is easy to set up, easy to clean, and produces an excellent cup in just three or four minutes. I retired my Keurig coffee machine, since it is very expensive per cup.My only caveat with regard to this coffee maker is that the beans must be ground to a semi-fine particle size (about 1/2 mm) since there is no holdup in the basket (the hot water flows very freely through the mesh in the basket)."
5,So Convenient!,"I bought this little coffeemaker to keep in my office at work, and it provides me with a great cup of coffee every morning. It's great for brewing a single cup, and it's very easy to clean. Exactly what I was looking for, and at such a cheap price!"
3,A little Messy,I have a finely ground coffee and it tends to make a bit of mess with the grounds. They end up in the water resivoir and on the lid that covers the filter. Pretty good otherwise.
3,Nice machine BUT the mug sucks!,"The machine itself is nice though I tend to leave the top open after I brew my coffee so it dries out during the day. The mug is another thing altogether. The seal failed between the outer and inner layer. When you first start drinking it's no problem but after condensation forms between the two layers it streams out, and down your chin(!), when you take a drink. Due to the odd size of the mug it took a while to find a replacement. I found one that works though. It's the ""Copco 16-oz. Desktop Mug, Stainless Steel"" and I found it for around 5 bucks at Wallyworld. If the B&D one came with this mug it's be perfect..."
1,You Get Your Money's Worth...,"I got one cup of coffee per day for one month out of this coffee maker before it broke. At the cost of a coffee stand coffee, I guess I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't purchase this product again."
1,Overflow of coffee grounds into cup and mug easily retains water,"What everyone else has written is true. You think, ""No, that won't happen to me."" I recommmend just buying a standard (really any other) coffee maker. The one cup brew just isn't worth it. The grounds overflow into your coffee and you end up with a layer on the bottom. After even hand washing the cup water seeps in through the rim and stays in between the two layer of the mug. Save yourself some time and money, DON'T buy this."
2,Messy,I had this coffee maker for two years before I chucked it. I was hoping this would be a great little addition to my dorm room but it only ever made a mess. Maybe mine was leaky or something but another girl on my floor said she had the same problem. Regardless I have deffinatly had better brews than what this made.
3,Hmmm...maybe I have a defective unit,"After reading the other reviews, I was surprised to note no one mentioned the single problem I have with my Brew 'N Go: The grounds float into the water reservior and down the outside of the permanent filter as it's brewing, causing the coffee to have grounds in it. It also causes quite a mess.I must say, though, it does a nice job - I like the taste of the brew. The only other issue I have is it gets the coffee too hot - which might be a good thing if you're commuting."
2,Mediocre Coffee,"I bought this to replace the Cuisinart 2 to go (TTG-500). I'm really disappointed in the quality of coffee. I don't know if the issue is that it doesn't heat the coffee hot enough, or if it doesn't steep it long enough--but I've gone back to boiling water on the stove and using a single cup drip method.Very disappointed.-Dave"
4,Great coffee maker for the price,"Bought this over a month ago. I only use it on the weekends as I drink most of my coffee at the office. It brews the coffee in about three minutes and the coffee is hot. The only drawback is the reusable filter. It can get get messy when you dump the grounds in the trash. Buy the filters, it makes clean up easier. At this price it's a great buy when you compare the price to the other single brewers and it makes a good cup using your own coffee."
1,Poor Design,As many said it overflows the coffee grounds. The built in filter is the worst. The grounds go over the top and into the water resavoir and down into the mug. I also tried #1 paper filters and the coffee grounds still go over the top.
3,Acceptable but not Outstanding,"The coffeemaker makes a decent, if not great, cup of coffee, and it is pretty convenient in brewing just the amount of coffee I plan on drinking. My main complaint is with the permanent filter that comes with the coffeemaker. A significant amount of coffee grounds get thru the filter and into the coffee, making the last few sips quite unpleasant. I am going to experiment with using a paper or cotton filter, to see if that works better, but the permanent filter alone is not good."
2,not good,"Pros: coffee tastes goodCons: lots of mess. For me it only brews half the cup and leaves a lot of water in the resevoir. I can sometimes get it all brewed hitting the button an extra time, but that didn't even work. I got this as a gift but think I am going to chuck it and buy another brand. Pretty disappointing:(Pat"
3,... it makes coffee,"I purchased this because I live in a dorm and can't have anything with a hot plate, like normal coffee pots do. It's okay, it makes coffee like it says it does.The coffee tastes a little odd, though. Sort of like plastic. But your average person probably wouldn't notice it-- I drink a lot of coffee and can tell little differences in taste."
2,Damaged product,"Box product arrived in was damaged. I don't believe the coffeemaker was used but there appeared to be scum on the outside of the maker as well as scratches.My comments were sent on to Dorm Co, the sender, and they replied that a new coffeemaker would be sent to me and they would send instructions on returning the damaged one. To this date, I have heard nothing further from them.A refund in the amount of $24.08 was made to my VISA account but I still have not received word of how to return the damaged coffeemaker.I look forward to hearing from soneone.Barbara Fulforth"
5,My Best Friend in the Blue Mountains,"I go to Jamaica frequently and stay at the same resort every time. The restaurant at the resort doesn't open until 8am and I am usually up around 6am. With some of the best coffee in the world all around me, I hate to have to wait for my morning cuppa Blue Mountain Joe. Bought one of these puppies a couple years ago and take it along every trip. This unit has seen major action - thousands of cups and still works great. I use it when I get home and only want one cup. Buying another one for a trip mate this time. Yes it is cheaply made but for under $20 I'm not expecting a golden espresso machine."
1,don't waste your money,I bought this coffeemaker as a christmas present for my wife. She is the only person in the house that drinks coffee. I read the reviews on all the coffeemakers and chose this one. Bad choice!! The first cup of coffee was brewed December 25 and the last cup was brewed February 15. It worked for a grand total of 51 days. It cost $29.99 for the coffeemaker and over $17.00 to ship it. This is junk! Don't buy it! I'm really surprised at Black and Decker for making such a worthless product. I've purchased many products from them over the years that have been of excellent quality. This will have me thinking twice before buying anything else from them.
1,Junk,Ordered item 30 July 2005. Unit stopped working 20 Dec 2005. Prior to complete failure unit would frequently brew only half a cup. Fortunately the item is not expensive but we get what we pay for.
2,DIED,"When I first received my coffee maker it made a decent cup of coffee, worked quickly and was easy to clean. Then after about 1 month of making 1 or 2 cups a day it died. no light, nothing. Being a curious and having a technical background I disassembled mine and discovered that it has 2 thermal fuses in the heating element circuitry in contact with the heating tube. These are to prevent overheating and a possible fire hazard. I have read several reviews where owners have stated that the coffee maker turns on by itself, which, if there was no water in the coffee maker and it had no fuses, would be a definite fire hazard. One of these fuses in mine was blown and they're not replaceable. I'm guessing that it turned on by itself, with no water, overheated and subsequently blew it's fuse. I assume that's why the makers tell you to unplug the unit when it's not in use. My coffee maker is out with the trash, but I guess if you unplug it when it's not in use.......It IS an inexpensive unit."
5,Love my Brew and Go,"My current Brew and Go unit is nearly 20 years old! A friend visited me and we like different coffee so it was great because we could each have the coffee we like, fresh and hot with each cup.I've schlepped the Brew and Go with me on vacation, and to various places where a coffee pot was not readily available. My unit is white, and I've taken good care of it. There's nothing wrong with my filter after all of these years.The unit I have uses regular cups, as long as they fit between the dripper and the platform.I bought my coffee maker at K-mart for about $10, so considering how great it is, I think that it's a bargain. Go ahead, if you like your coffee one cup at a time (and I DO!) then you'll love this."
3,just okay,"The original image for this item showed a stainless steel mug. It arrived scratched and the cup is unsightly. It works well to make a larger single cup of coffee, but overall it's not very well made OR aesthetically pleasing."
3,Disappointed,"This product had such high reviews I thought it would be perfect to replace a Melitta individual coffee maker which had finally died after many years of faithful service. My husband looked forward to more happy coffee making, but he is not particularly happy with the Black and Decker coffeemaker. Too bad."
1,Barely lasted 6 weeks,"This is the first time that I had a coffeemaker break within months. I bought this in December and here we are beginning of February and it no longer works. The water does not heat, no light indicator - nothing. To bad it was great while it lasted but I need a coffeemaker that lasts more than 6 weeks"
3,Worked Great But...,Used every day for about 3 months but then stopped working. Nice little coffee maker for the money. But looks like I'm going shopping for another coffee maker. AGAIN.
2,Not impressed,"Bought this for my mom because she drinks coffee slowly, but was disappointed. The travel mug is cheap and doesn't keep the coffee hot. We've had to go back to a regular coffee maker."
5,I love this coffee maker,"I use it for the office, it's great that filters are needed. It's quick and easy to make a cup of coffee, and the amount of money saveds is priceless..."
5,Great machine!,"I've had three of these little brewers. Wore the first one out after about 5 years -- prematurely I suppose, but for 18 bucks what can you expect -- and then bought two more about 4 years ago. All have worked well, brew a great cup of coffee and are simple as all get out to use: coffee in, water in, poke the button, out comes as good a coffee as the ingredients you put in. Even my 85-year-old mother has one -- a fourth one -- and runs it without much problem -- though she does have a tendency to scatter the grounds into the water container if the filter is in the brewer. So takes it out to put the coffee in. Simple. And good coffee."
1,didn't last long,"We bought this in October. With daily use I would expect it to last at least a year. Sadly, yesterday it no longer worked!!! my advice, don't buy this one. I have had Black and Decker similar models in the past that have lasted at least 5 years. This one obviously is not the same quality."
1,Don't Buy,This stopped working after one week. Just would not turn on - do not recommend purchasing.
5,Get for college dorm,"I made the mistake of buying my son a regular size coffeemaker in his Freshman year of college; he never used it even though he drinks coffee every morning. This year I bought him this one cup, ready to go, coffeemaker. He uses it every day! The cup is a ""To-go-cup"", so he doesn't have to brew a whole pot of coffee and then transfer the coffee to a cup that he can take out the door with him.No wasted coffee and convenient to transport."
1,"good idea, bad product! Coffee ground EVERYWHERE","I love the idea but this coffee maker is disappointing. It doesn't matter how much coffee I put in, or how large the coffee ground is, they do not get filter out. My cup of coffee always has great amount of coffee ground that I have to drain my coffee at least twice everytime for it to be drinkable. Also, because the coffee ground gets every where, washing is a pain! I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,Okay in the beginning but failed as time went on,"I really liked this product when I first bought it to take to college. It got good reviews and was highly rated so I bought it. For the first few months it worked great. Made coffee fast and at a good temperature. But lately it has stopped working. When I turn it on it stays on for about 30 seconds before shutting itself off. I can't find any explanation for why it's doing this. There's no clog, always enough water, and there's no problem with the power.I'm buying a new, Mr. Coffee coffeemaker."
5,This one has lasted 5 years!,"This is my third Brew 'N Go and it's still running 5 years later. It get used daily up to 3 or 4 times a day. Simple, easy to use and it works!"
2,Not good if you like strong coffee!,"This product is good if you like your coffee weak or to make tea. No matter how much coffee grinds I add, I cannot get the coffee to be strong enough. I even tried switching types of coffee and grinds. It didn't help. I do use it to make hot water for my tea or instant cereal. I did end up buying a Mr. Coffee 4 cup coffee maker so I can drink better tasting coffee."
2,coffee diva,"The reviews for this item were mixed but I needed a pot for my office where I could brew a fresh cup when I wanted to. Well, this coffeemaker is not only messy but doesn't brew a decent cup of coffee. It is currently in a cabinet gathering dust. I bought a Thermos carafe and have a better cup of coffee without the mess."
3,This thing is a mess,"Makes okay coffee -- problem is that the grounds get all over.After it finishes brewing there are grounds in the water reservoir, and generally all over the inside of the machine in the area where it does its thing. I have to take it to the sink and wash out the whole thing everytime I use it. No big deal really, but kind of a pain.I know that the standard response will be that I'm putting in too much coffee, but I've tried it with less and the taste of the coffee suffers with only minimally less mess.All in all, for $16 it isn't bad -- just beware of the mess."
1,Not what it used to be...,"I owned and loved my Brew n' Go Coffeemaker for many years, and even purchased several to give as gifts. I found it to be a great product, especially for the price. But the newest model went on the fritz in less than a month and began shutting off halfway through the brewing process. I did an online search and found it wasn't an isolated incident. I'm more than disappointed and will not buy another one. Ever."
1,I would pass on this one,"Great idea, but you get what you pay for. Like many others have written, 75% of the time the coffee grinds overflow and find their way into the water tank and ultimately into your cup. It's nasty and not drinkable. You end up wasting time and material. Even the cup was junk. Right out of the box, the cup outer shell separated from the inner liner and handle. Useless. It's all going in the trash now!"
2,Okay for the price,"I have used Black & Decker single cup machines for years. I am not a big coffee drinker, and the machines are inexpensive, so I didn't mind having to replace them often because the start switch breaks regularly. However, after repeated switch breakage, I've reached my limit and am searching for another brand and a switch that is not the press downward, springloaded type. I think it must be the internal spring that breaks. Since this has happened to me for years (10+), I can't imagine that Black & Decker isn't aware of it, so I suppose they don't care."
2,Smells Funny,"I bought this on 8/4/06. When I first got the coffee maker, I ran plain water through the machine to get the plastic smell out. Afterwards, the machine still smelled like plastic, now I've ran vinegar through the machine and still no help. The horrible plastic smell is still there. Baking soda is no use also. The only thing I've not used is bleach. If you don't mind the plastic smell then this is a good small machine that works well with most coffee cups. Makes really hot cups of coffee and none of the leaking problems."
5,Life's Simple pleasures,"This little devil will make you smile. I don't think brewing a cup o' joe could get any easier. I have had mine for about 3 months now. How I lived without it is beyond me.Any short comings? NopeAny suggestions? NopeIt works flawlessly.Instructions:Grind beans, pour beans in to filter. Pour cup water in to machine. Press button. Count to 100. Drink coffee. Clean Filter. Repeat.The non-replaceable filter is perfect. It cleans easily, and nothing gets through it. No, you don't need to grind your own beans. But, this little guy makes it so easy, with the time you save using it, why not grind your own beans?"
3,Single cup of coffee machine,"The only problem I have is that it is hard to avoid getting water in the filter portion of the machine. Other than that, it works very well."
2,quit working after one month,"Can not complain the price since I got it for 15 bucks. But it only lasted for less than a month. After use it for about 15 times, it just dead. BTW, mug is good, worth for one star."
3,Wouldn't buy it again,"In less than a year it went from heating water but not really hot, to taking longer and longer to heat it and heating it even less."
2,"Original was great, but bad coffee filter design on this model","I loved my original one, but the coffee filter (plastic mesh) finally came apart. I bought another from Amazon and have had nothing but trouble because they CHANGED THE FILTER DESIGN which lets less coffee through and often causes the coffee to overflow into the water reservoir and it's such a humongous hassle to clean out the grounds.I'm very disappointed. I've now been using paper filters but the coffee doesn't taste as rich as it does with a wire mesh filter.Grrrrrrrrr! Why did they mess with the original design? Probably because they don't care and didn't test it.Nothing matches the wonderfulness of making just a single cup of coffee. Black and Decker ruined the experience.Also, you can microwave a this cup, but not the stainless steel ones!"
1,defective straight out of box,I Bought this as a christmas present and straight out of the box this coffee maker did not work sputters and turns off before it has brewed the coffe
4,B & D Brew N Go,"I don't have any problems with this little machine at all. I read the reviews before purchasing it and there were some complaints about coffee ground spilling into the cup. There were also some reviews with tips for avoiding that, and I used those tips from the beginning and it has worked just perfectly every time :)"
1,Didn't last a month!,"I purchased this coffeemaker for my daughter, who lives in a college dorm, in Sept.2010. In less than a month, the on switch malfunctioned and the unit will not turn on. When the company was contacted, they offered to send a new unit, but we have to pay the shipping charges which are about one half of what we paid for the coffeemaker. Not exactly a deal in my eyes. She went ahead and got another unit, a Keurig, and we hope that since we spent more it will be a better quality and last longer. This was a relatively inexpensive unit, but should have lasted longer than it did."
3,works fine,"I own this and haven't had any problems yet (it's worked every day for the past 2 months.) Got a good value on it through my gold box at amazon. My main complaint is that the inside is made of plastic.. many scientists are concerned about different plastics having adverse health consequences, and though the FDA has not acted yet on a federal level, i'm not going to wait around for them to act. So I don't use the cup anymore at this stage, I have another one that I bring my coffee to work in that is stainless steel. Am not enthusiastic about the inner plastic on the maker itself either so I will be changing this as soon as I see a good deal."
4,Very good with a little flaw,"This product has worked well for me. The only problem is very finely ground coffee can overflow the filter basket and get grounds in the coffee. I use 4 tablespoons of coffee per ""11"" ounce cup."
5,great product!...,"I use this on a daily basis... easy to use, clean and manuever... Recommend to anyone looking for a single cup coffee maker... great for those BIG mugs of coffee..."
1,"poorly made, poorly designed",Since it was new the switch never worked correctly. I had to pull the plug after each use. Now it has stopped working. I forgot and left it plugged in and that must have overheated some thermostat or some other control. Also poorly designed. Grinds constantly get into the water tank. Also pouring the water in was designed for left-handed people. The tank opening is on the left side and it difficult to do with your right hand. Not recommended.
2,big disappointment,"bought it..used it twice and the 'permanent filter' had come loose. the filter is glued(?) to the filter cup. uponcloser inspection, it showed that the filter was applied sloppilyat the factory causing it to be weakly held down on one side andexcessively more on the other side of the filter cup.I also agree with other review concerning the small water reservoirand the apparent malfunctioning power switch.A very disappointing product from a company with serious QAissues."
4,A solid suit for the money.,"I purchased this suit for an interview and was pleasantly surprised with it's quality given the great price. Unfortunately, the pants were pleated and just did not look good on me so I had to return it. That process was much smoother than expected and I was very pleased.I will definitely head back to this seller when I need a suit in the future."
2,Lacking in some quality and delivery,Received the suit today on time but it is not a three button suit as advertised but a two button suit. I am also not that satisfied with the quality of the material. It feels more like a polyester blend than merino wool. Returning suit.
4,Overall does the job!,"The mirror allows baby to see herself (very entertaining). The driver can see her in the rear view mirror (also very entertaining!) The only problem with the design is that it won't stay securely in place on the headrest if you bump it, for example, when getting baby in and out of the carseat."
4,Great product,"I had originally purchased a small suction cup mirror, and it kept falling off the window onto my baby. I looked at the other mirrors and if you don't have a headrest, which most cars don't in the middle seat, you have to pin the mirror in place. I have leather interior and this was not an option I was willing to consider. Then I found this product which can be attached using the tether connection. That is a great option. I've had it for about a month now, and it has not moved out of place at all. It gives a great sense of security to be able to see my baby with a quick clance into the rear-view mirror. The only downside is that the mirror sticks up a little bit too high in the back window, and slightly affects my visibility when backing up."
3,Not for a car without a headrest,"I thought this product was a great idea. However, I found that mounting it in my Trail Blazer was a pain in the neck. My son's rear-facing car seat is in the middle of the back seat, where there is no headrest. This posed a huge problem. I could not get the mirror to stay where it needed to be without pinning it to my seat. Then, it wasn't even wide enough to see him well, and the fact that it is curved, didn't help. I would not recommend this mirror for cars without a headrest. My mom uses it in her mini-van, where there is a headrest, and it works pretty well for her."
3,Just an ok product!,"For one thing is was very difficult to install in our SUV, but we did manage to figure out a way! Also, it is still very hard to actually see your child's face therefore it defeats the purpose of why we bought it. I would never recommend this product to any of my friends."
2,Doesn't work in my car,"I have a smaller car and this mirror didn't not fit like it promised. Even when I tried to use if for other purposes, it was very hard to see anything anyway."
2,Mirror is not clear,"I was very disappointed to find scratches and spotty film all over the mirror when I pulled off the protective film. I wiped it with a soft cloth as recommended, but it just got worse. I can barely see myself in the mirror never mind the baby."
1,This mirror is small.,"My wife and I just received this mirror in the mail today. The viewing part of this mirror is small, a little larger than a softball. We are sending it back tomorrow."
1,Not very useful,"I bought this mirror when my baby was only a few days old so I could keep an eye on her when she's in her carseat. It worked well at first but then it sort of frosted over and now I can't see anything in it. It's just cloudy and nothing will make it go away. I've tried Windex, soap and water, damp cloth..."
2,"Some good, some bad","This is a truly 2 star product. Overall, not bad, good in some areas, and very poor in others. Here's the breakdown:The Positives:-Colorful design that babies love.-Straps snug and secure to our headrest, Best on the market in this area, IMHO.-Baby can see themselves in the mirror well.The Negatives:- The round shape. The frame of the mirror protrudes over the top of the headrest, blocking part of your rear visibility. It's not prohibitively bad, but it's a stupid design flaw.-The mirror makes the baby look like they are 20 feet away.-The most visible item on the mirror which catches your eye is the Fisher Price logo. This is a person peeve, but I simple despise when companies doing these tacky, slimy marketing moves.After installing this, I did shop around to see if there was anything better. (Mainly because of the way the mirror takes up more of the rear view than it needs to.) But I am sticking with this for now since I think it is the best on the market as far as I can tell."
4,Reassures this First-time Mom!,"In our prenatal class, it was stressed to not have anything ""extra"" around your baby in the car. Well, I think our instructor has forgotten what it's like to have a crying baby in the backseat. This product really reassures me. I can see what my son is doing - playing, sleeping, crying... I think he also enjoys seeing his reflection and the colorful mirror border and animals.I like how there are several ways to attach the mirror. We've used to j-hook to attach it to the tether hook in the backseat. You can also adjust the height of the mirror with the velcro tab. The downside - my husband and and I require different heights. It's a pain to change it every time we switch drivers, so I just have to sit up a little straighter to see into the mirror. Other than that, I really recommend this mirror!"
5,Great Mirror!,I am able to view my baby clearly in this mirror. It is securely attached so it's not going anywhere. I've noticed my baby looking at herself in this brightly colored mirror. I am happy with this and would buy it again.
1,NOT APPROVED BY CHP!!,"I went to the CHP office to get my car seat checked, and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile, possibly injuring or killing your child. DO NOT BUY!!"
2,"Cute Mirror, but poorly made","I love the look of the mirror however it wasn't made very well. I have only had it for five months and already three of the animals have fallen off which are pretty much the main attraction. Also, my son can see himself, but when I look in my rearview to see him he looks all distorted because of the shape of the mirror. I will probably take it out once the last animal falls off and I would recommend to parents to shop around for other mirrors."
1,"""CAUTION----Horrible for an SUV!!!!!!!!""","Aside from having a constant haze over the reflective mirror, this product is difficult to use, comes with no instructions/suggestions for use, and is unstable. While other reviews on this page praise this product for passenger vehicles, I found that there was no possible safe position for the mirror in my SUV - a 2003 GMC Envoy. I am very disappointed in Fisher-Price for dropping the ball on this one. I am an avid fan of their baby products, but after much effort, I admit that this one is the first real ""waste of money"". You can look for my e-bay listing on this item in the near future."
2,Wanted to like this product but ...,I've had a similar Black and Decker can opener for years and ordered this updated version hoping for the same service. It was not to be. It did open the cans smoothly but the magnetic lid holder failed within the first week of use. Examining this part of the product you can easily see that it is made poorly and even a replacement is likely to fail quickly so I returned this product and will purchase another brand/model.I am a long time customer of Amazon but never needed to return a product before. The good part of this experience is that I did learn that it is easy to return items and that they will even pay for the shipping.
1,Don't waste your money,"I've been using an electric can opener since 1955 and I really like them, that Sunbeam lasted for 55 years, this one 1 1/2 years. Hard to use, often very difficult to get the cans positioned properly to get it to work, leaves bits of paper all over the counter, and failed completely after 1 1/2 years, it won't even hold a can anymore. Almost all small appliances are made in China now, and they are very poor quality, so many of the things like this don't even last out the warranty, but it costs more to send them in than to buy another one. Come on Black & Decker, give us some quality small appliances!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"This is NOT worth it, bought it and followed the instructions and did not work. So, come to find out returning was easy, buy they have the same at Wal*Mart for $3 more than on here, why not try it again? Didn't work!!!! Just trust me and do NOT buy this can opener. I understand one not working but that is not only all of it, I saw another review saying this item company discontinued it. hmmm.... wonder why?!"
2,hard to operate can opener,I works ok once you figure how to work it and then it is thochy about opening a can.
3,Good but not great,"This does a great job of being a good HDMI switch. It allows you to conenct 4 HDMI devices to one TV HDMI slot. Even better it comes with 4 high quality HDMI cables, cables which can be $30 to $100 on their own. However, it does not come w/the required HDMI to DVI cable to connect this to your TV. I over looked this when i ordered this. Had i seen this i would have not gone w/this product. As a result of this HDMI to DVI cable this box does not do audio. It does however do the picture very well. Saddly unles all your HDMI devices use Optical audio cables you will be back at square 1 as you TV w/One HDMI port only has on set of audio jacks. This is bad because no matter what device is selected you will always here the audio that is hooked to the HDMI port on your TV. For this price i would have expected that this device do the audio and well as video. As it turns out i will be buying a cheaper procuct that does both video and audio for 5 devices."
2,Warning!,"My 4 yr old grandson loved Franklin and Friends. Dish changed their programming and we no longer get it on TV, so I purchased these videos. Grandson LEARNED TO SAY ""STUPID"" because of this video! Franklin gets mad and says stupid to his toys! Many time outs later, grandson has learned that stupid is not a good word to use! Have not played them in quite a while."
5,Great book!,My friend from Italy suggested this book... she was spot on! This is for anyone who wants something more than just the usual lingo!
1,Nice looking but with no future,"I got 3 V stands and 2 of them got broken in the first months. The bad thing is that I live overseas (outside the US) and the shipping cost to get a replacements are more than the stands temselves.In order to set the stands in the right position you have to pull a little clip that will return to the position holding the telemetric harms back. Well, those clips get broken because are made of a thing hard plastic that does not resist the preassure when you pull it out. So the telemetric harm falls with you gear on top.I got the double tier but as they are blended metal they are not blended equally and you can tell the keyboard on top lays on a side.Using the V stand itself is ok but the add ons take a lot of space and makes the old fashioned Ultimate Apex stand the best portable solution when using more than one keyboard."
1,Warning! Does not play on Vista 64,"3d Ultra Pinball Creep NightI've played another version of this series on an older computer back when it was current, and loved it. I remember reading reviews for this game when it came out too, and they were glowing. So I really looked forward to getting this game once I saw it was still offered here.Unfortunately, it does not play on a a Windows Vista 64 system. Quite a disappointment. Watch out! If you have an earlier system, you might do better, but if not, save your money.Sorry to rate the game so low, but if you can't even play it, I think that clearly makes it deserve a low rating. I will note again, though, that the earlier entry in this series I played (on Windox XP perhaps? it was long ago) was wonderful, and if you don't have Windows Vista 64, you may love this game too. I would have loved to love it if I had the chance."
1,50 cents was way too much for me.,Let me start by telling you this game was copyrighted in 1997. A Lot has changed with video games in 11 years. What you have to go through to install this game is aggravating.The graphics are way too far behind the new releases to keep me interested. The one that comes with windows xp is way better. I took it right back of my computer. REAL TALK!
1,memory stick,"unable to use, the description did not give specific details on which camera the memory sticks could or could not be used in. I had to send them back and am still awaiting the response."
5,Good price,"I think what makes different this product from a Sony, etc. is the price. This was lower enough. The service from Amazon was quite slow."
4,A book that stirs action,"This book was given to me as a gift by someone who knew I have a strong bond with children from China. Each page I turned brought memories flooding back of the time I spent caring for children just like these, behind the walls of the secretive orphanage. Some of the haunting expressions are reminders of those I saw on a daily basis. When I feel my memories of China fading, I pull out the book to take me back. I believe a person cannot look through it and avoid being stirred to action to do something to help the cause of lost children in China.www.kaybratt.com"
5,From a parent,"I purchased this book for my wife as we have adopted a baby girl from China. While these photos are from a different orphanage, the impact is the same. We did not get to see all the children at our daughter's orphanage, and they don't allow photos of the kids anyway. I recommend this book for any adoptive parents of children from China, or those looking into it. I will warn you, you will want to go back for more."
3,Heartbreaking,"As an adoptive parent of a beautiful Chinese girl, I became extremely upset when I viewed these pictures. But by the grace of God, my daughter could have been featured in this book. That thought and the pictures of these children absolutely broke my heart. The pictures are beautiful but left me with a sense of helplessness because you can't save them all....although you want to. I returned the book because it was just too upsetting. I was torn between giving the book 5 stars because of the impact it has, but gave it 3 so someone might read this review and think twice about viewing it. It was not worth it for me."
2,Sad book,"The photos in this book are very sad. I am not sure who would want this book. I can only imagine how upsetting an adoptive child would be to leaf through the pages. While a few children are happy, quite a few are sad, crying and have injuries or defects."
4,CD is it Borat??,"The verbal visualization is very good but the individual who is speaking has a heavy accent..polish, russian?...just a heads-up. I'd have to give this CD less than 5 stars because of it."
2,Didn't fit worth a hoot,Disappointed in the way the sock fit. It should have read small solid-color tube sock. I couldn't get it up past my ankle which sucked. Good thick material yet the fit was false.I donated to some thrift store instead after receiving them! I'll never buy from this outfit(sock company) again!!!!
4,Neon Green Tube Socks,"These socks are wonderful! I was afraid that they wouldn't be bright enough, but these socks are very much neon. They are plenty long and comfortable. However, I try to use them sparingly. When the box arrived, I put them on around the house to see how they looked on me, and after only five minutes of wearing them, the bottom of the foot was slightly worn. Overall a great sock."
1,A Fritz Lang Turkey,"Fritz Lang's second western is a horrible mess, much worse than ""Western Union."" He strives for the light humor of Ford westerns but the humor feels awkward and downright creepy. It would have been better if he had played the movie straight up instead of trying to be cute."
4,It's About Time,I have been waiting a long time to have this Henry Fonda Movie on DVD. It is one of those movies you can watch over and over again. Henry Fonda as Frank James is one of the cooles cowboys ever. The supporting cast of characters makes the story that much better. You will cheer for Frank James in the end.
2,An inferior Fonda Western.,"This sequel to 1939's far superior ""Jesse James"" misses much of the humor and stark imagery that made the first film such a (underrated)masterpiece. Fonda is good as Frank but the script gives him little to do and Lang's direction is likewise handsome but undistinguished. A minor addition in both the Lang canon and the Fonda Western canon."
4,"Lang's First ""Western Noir""","In 1940, Darryl Zanuck gave Fritz Lang the opportunity to shoot his first Western - a sequel to director Henry King's ""Jesse James"" (1939). When asked why he allowed Lang to make a Western, the Fox producer responded: ""Because he'll see things we don't."" Lang's attention to detail and atmosphere dominates this unusual tale of revenge. ""The Return of Frank James"" also marks a cinematic advance for the German director in his vivid use of Technicolor and location photography. An impressive highlight is the chase through the High Sierras - a spectacular action sequence that reveals Lang's expressionist design in his use of architectural rock formations. ""The Return of Frank James"" has a look and feel unlike any Western of the period. In some respects, it can be considered the first ""Western noir."" Henry Fonda delivers a memorable performance in the title role, with good support from Henry Hull, John Carradine and Jackie Cooper."
5,A Classic Western from a Classic Director and Classic Actor,"This movie is much better than what the other reviewers would have you believe. While it is a sequel, it stands on its own as sort of a revenge flick with Frank (Henry Fonda) terrorizing and delivering retribution to John Carradine's Robert Ford, the man who shot Jesse James. It is also the screen debut of the beautiful Gene Tierney. Compared to the special effects laden trash spewn out by Hollywood today, this has excellent characterization, excellent plot and excellent acting. It is definitely worth the price of admission. Fritz Lang did a great job of depicting his vision of the Old West and while it may not be the greatest Lang film such as his 1931 classic, M, it is still a classic nonetheless."
3,The Return of Frank James,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
5,the return of frank james,I thought it was an excellent sequel to the first movie.Henry Fonda was excellent as Frank James.
5,This is an essential color guide to greatest color system on Earth.,"The pantone system is the best system we have for remote communication of standardized color. Any factory anywhere on earth can translate Pantone from a digital file. If you don't have a master book of the colors, you will be guessing in the dark about what color you print project will really be. Indispensable."
5,A MUST READ FOR ANYONE BORN SINCE 1948!!,This amazingly little book will add new knowledge to your previous understanding of our history as well as some interesting perspectives into our world and nation in the 21t century. As you read you will probably have to keep pinching yourself and remembering that the words of Rose Wilder Lane were written about a period long since past but are quite applicable to our experiences today. This is one of my favorite books on freedom along side the 5000 Year Leap and numerous books about our founding fathers.
3,Which coffee maker does this Filter fit ?,"Be sure you match up the sizing of your coffee maker before buying this filter. There are many different sizes.For this filter it states directly on the box : Fits Krups coffee Makers Model Numbers: 252, 466, 467, 458, and 144..Check out the Krups website just to be sure you have the correct size before placing your order with Amazon..Filter came as stated.. I just didn't do my research before placeing the order.. re-ordering the correct size.."
3,Krups gold coffee Filter,I love it. It saves money because I don't have to buy the paper filters and it's washable.
4,replacing my old one.,This is my 3rd one in 24 years. Hopefully will last as long as others. Krups seems better made than Braun
1,Wrong size,This filter was too large for my Krups coffee maker and I had to throw it out. Compatible model numbers should be included.
2,"Fiddly, cheap, bad fit","We purchased a Krups gold filter for a Krups ""specialty machine"" (KM7000) expecting it to be a perfect fit and well made. Compared to a gold filter we previously had, it's very flimsy, and it does let finely ground coffee particles through. It is also quite short, so there's a bit of a mess to clean up when you make a full pot of coffee. We're only keeping it so that we have a filter in case we ever run out of paper filters but will use paper filters because they're tidier, fit better and - something composters want to think about - the coffee grounds are easier to dispose of in the compost."
1,Doesn't fit size 2,Product description doesn't tell you what size filter this is. It is a size 4. It did not fit our size 2 filter holder. Product returned.
3,Not good as gold,"First let me say that I bought this re-usable filter based on user reviews and the idea that I could stop buying the paper filters. There are a few downsides to using this filter. When you have finished brewing the coffee there is a silt residue at the bottom of the pot. It is something akin to the stuff on the bottom of a tea pot. You will notice a strange metallic taste with this filter. You have to clean the filter after each use. Dumping the grounds in the trash can gets most of the grounds, but you have to rinse the filter to clean out the remainder. I've had this filter nearly two months and I may go back to paper filters just to make sure the things I've noted here are directly related to the Gold Tone Filter."
2,Coffee doesn't taste well,"While I save the expense of filters, it just doesn't give me that clean taste of coffee that another more metallic brand of permanent filter gives me. In fact it has the look of gold colored nylon versus the more ""solid"" golden filters of other brands.Cleaning it is a bear, not so much getting the stains out, that works well enough, but it takes a lot of water to finally purge the filter of grounds that accumulate in various nooks and crannies.But it's still probably in improvement over the paper filters."
3,Previously listed as model 53-033,"This was originally listed as a different model number. It is NOT compatible with Gevalia brewers (at least 2011-2012 models).Seems to be well made, but was returned immediately for refund."
4,need more,I especially liked the first dvd withthe scenes shot in the 1960's.My only regret is there is not enoughmaterial from Dick (only 50 or so minutes)I mean he did spend 35+ years out there.Some later solo footage would have been great.Dick's story is captivating and Bob's narrationfits perfectly with the message.I enjoyed the recent encounter withDick (DVD 2) but again the footage is too short.The Swerer footage is very nice but lacks the soulof the material in Disc 1.
5,Amazing story -- a must see for anyone interested in the outdoors,"Dick Proenecke lived alone for 20+ years in the Alaskan wilderness. This is his story, beginning with movies of him building his log cabin by hand, alone, with no help! It is amazing. If you like the outdoors and/or if you like to build things you must see this! His story is so incredible that you would not believe it if it were not captured on film and in his hand-written journals. Proenecke loved nature and his story includes detailed descriptions of the weather, wildlife and his survival methods. He actually lived quite well, considering he had NO modern conveniences of any kind. He even constructed many of his own tools."
4,Great DVD,I wish it were a bit longer! My wife and I watched the dvd's on a rainy Sunday afternoon and found them very relaxing to watch. I would recommend this set to anyone interested in the outdoors and solitude. Well worth the price.
1,Terrible product...if I could give it 0 stars I would,"I've never used a breast pump until last week for the first time.The manufacturer forget to put the bottle (nipple and cover pieces) in the set I purchased from Babies R Us. The pump has high and low settings to adjust for your breastfeeding comfort but, it was torture. It hurt so bad it made my eyes water. I still have tried to use it three more times and I'm retiring it officially today. The baby is 3 weeks old and I have only been able to get out 1 oz the last two times I used it. The first time I used it, I forced myself to fall asleep with it on and about 3 hours later only 4 oz. came out. It's a waste of money and time!"
1,not worth buying,"Horrible pump, the suction hurts, and so does the shell where it touches your skin. And since it requires one hand to operate the controls, you cannot really double pump at all. I ended up buying the avent manual pump which was much better."
1,Get what you pay for...,"I would not recommend this pump to anyone. The pump hurts and I have to use both hands. The breast shield has fallen off of it while I was pumping and a few times, my milk was suctioned INTO the pump somehow! Also it is very loud & annoying. Poor model, do not buy and waste your money!"
1,Worst Pump Created,I purchased this pump and it initially hurt on the lowest setting as another user experienced too and is very loud. It does not pump mych milk at all! After about 10 uses the suction began to stop working and still does not work. I recommend purchasing the extended warranty becasue you will be returning it. I have since bought an Ameda pump which does not even compare. It does not hurt even on the highest setting and pumps about 4oz in 7 minutes! Invest in quality!
3,decent for the price,easy to use but motor sounds sluggish at times and the suction on the breast is alittle uncomfortable when done.Other than that it does its job.
2,only volume 2 of 3,"This is one of several available reprints of this novel that is the basis for artist Tom Phillips' ongoing project,A Humument. What the product description does not tell you is that this is Volume Two of a three-volume series. It starts on Chapter 12. So don't buy this expecting to have the entire novel. There are other re-prints ofVolume 1andVolume 3available here, and you can download Volume 1 for free on Internet Archive."
1,Dissapointed,I was so happy today when I went to the post office to get my new purchase. When I came home and opened the package however I was severly dissapointed.The sword I took out was not the one I ordered. So I checked my mail and logged in to Amazon to be certain that I had not done a wrong order. Then I checked the sellers invoice that was with the package.. both was showing this sword that I am now writing the review about but my sword does not look anything like it at all.The quality of the guard and handle on the sword I recieved is among the worst I have seen sofar. I really hope this is just a freak mistake from the seller and that he usually does not make such mistakes.Not happy at all
4,Helpful for Bible study,Atlas of the Bible has some great pictures and has helpful background when doing Bible study. It presents topics in easy to read vocabulary. One example is picture of Temple so you have a mental picture of what things looked like in Bible times . This helps put things in perspective.
1,Atlas of the Bible - a used book purchase,"I expected the book to be old, it is. But the smell of the book was so bad I had to throw it away. It smelled musty and moldy. So this purchase was a complete waste of my money and time."
1,Worst can opener I have ever owned!!!,Bought this to replace a cheap Rivan can opener that had a broken lid-retaining magnet. Biggest mistake. It routinely drops cans - even light ones like soup and mushrooms. Difficult to attach the can to it - and even harder to clean. Aviod this model at all costs.
2,let down,"I have always liked black and decker products, but i dont know what happened the are putting out junk. Dont buy this or their toaster oven."
2,Works great when it works,"Murderous to install, but sleek looking once you're done reading the small print and have your new opener ensconced under the cabinet. Often the can doesn't catch on the first try; when it does, it whirls around in a poetically lovely circle, the lid perfectly caught by the magnet as you stand back in awe. In the past, I've favored Black & Decker without reservation. I am losing my enthusiasm."
2,Jerry's Can Opener Review,Has trouble with some steel cans. Doesn't cut smoothly (a lot of ripples). Have to reposition can frequently.
2,"""folk"" is a subjective term","Unfortunately, this book is such an eclectic collection that I was unfamiliar with most of the songs. Not being an officianado, I was looking for songs to play and sing with children and was disappointed to find such sparse material to work with. This collection may be better suited for someone who has studied folk music, rather than someone less knowledgeable."
4,Sexy Seduction Between Friends,"Tori Carrington's SKIN DEEP is the dream relationship of most women, falling in love with your best friend. Yeah, an age old plot line, but it works very well once again. Kyra gets dumped and decides she needs a change, so she turns herself into a sexier version of herself. Her best friend, Michael, can't stand other men seeing the new fleshier and sexier version. He realizes he wants that sassy woman just for his pleasure! But dare they risk their freindship to become intimate? Sparks fly off the pages when these two get together. Very steamy and very entertaining!Reviewed by Miriam van Veen"
5,delightful blend,"Initially I was sceptical when I discovered that La Nef had constructed this musical rendering of Percival but I can say that I find it immensely attractive! Blending traditional celtic tunes with mediaeval instrumentation and the early french text (deeply edited) results in a fresh, lively and engaging production--a thoughful parable for our time. Well done! I can recommend it to serious early music buffs who cringe at the ""disco chant"" approach of some other cds..."
3,Bolt Surprise,"I ordered this Porsche hub to attach a new MOMO wheel to my '83 911sc. I also scored a MOMO Porsche crest horn button, but combining the pieces we learned that the MOMO bolts that came with the wheel weren't long enough to attach the wheel, ring, and horn button - so beware of that if you're putting this same group together."
1,If I could give it negative stars I would!!!,"I got this as a Christmas gift and was so excited about it! After making coffee twice,(the pot and lid are very cheap quality) it no longer worked, so I took it to be repaired. The shop sent it to Krupps, 9 weeks later I finally got it back. The element was bad and had burnt out (nothing I did). I was just glad to have my EXPENSIVE maker back. The next morning I poured water in, and it came out the bottom of the machine!! It is now at Krupps service department again. It has been there for a month now, I have spoken to someone at Krupps, and still have no response. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS MACHINE OR COMPANY!! It is the begining of April and have had 2 cups of coffee from this maker that I have owned for over 3 months. I have been using the same $25 ""Mr. Coffee"" maker for 10years now without one problem!!"
2,very disappointed,"The Espresso side of this machine is totally worthless. The coffee side has problems but I find if I use a Gold screen and a paper filter, it works better. You must take apart and keep clean. This is definitely not worth the money."
3,More Expensive Doesn't Mean Better,"As a prior owner of a Krups Expresso/Coffee maker combo unit, I thought that this model, priced substantially more that my last one, would be far superior. The coffeemaker works well, but the expresso side was a disappointment. The expresso it made was only lukewarm, and the ""perfect froth"" attachment was harder to access than on my other machine. I heard about the other less expensive Krups machines having an aluminum core, and I know that could pose a health risk, but I feel the less expensive machine is at least equal to the one I purchased...and it has more attachments.With this machine, you only get one expresso nipple that makes two expressos at once. So basically you have to have two expresso cups underneath to fill since the machine doesn't come with an expresso carafe. I just don't see the value ..."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this machine based on glowing recommendations and had pretty high expectations. It was bigger than I imagined, and showed a few areas of obvious cost-cuttingÑmostly on the coffee maker side. I first tried making cappucino, and it quickly and easily made two lukewarm cups. Next, I tried to set it up to make coffee the next morning. Since it doesn't have external water level markings, I had to use the carafe to measure the water. As I was starting to pour the water, the handle partially popped off, spilling water all over the counter. Luckilly it wasn't full of hot coffee! Braun coffee makers have a similar handle design, but they seem to be firmly glued on rather than clipped on like the Krups. That coupled with other cheaply made components got this coffee maker a trip back to Amazon."
2,Three good years,"This machine gave us three good years - then it started leaking, we could not figure out from where. We own about 6 Krups products so we are not newbies or predisposed to be critical of Krups. We would so much like to love this machine but it pees like a puppy from places unknown.We have set the machine on a cookie tray because we still haven't found anything we want instead.Cheers,Helmut and Missy"
3,Price Is Everything,I have an old Krups from 10 years back that makes both drip coffee and expresso... I enjoy Cuban coffee daily and the expresso machine using the right coffee makes great expresso... i bought this one for the look and upgrade ... i returned it and brought out my old Krups ... yes this one is nice and everything but it is not worth the money ... and it's not the machine that makes the good coffee it's the user
1,Spend the money and buy a better machine,I received this machine as a gift and was incredibly excited about it. The first thing I did was load it with a freshly roasted espresso grind coffee and filled it with water and turned it on. After 15 minutes I had a teaspoon of espresso. I read the trouble shooting guide and it said that my grind was too fine. I now use a grind of coffee in the espresso maker that is more course than I use for the auto drip. I still wait and wait and wait for a 6oz of coffee. It comes out two drops at a time and by the time it is done I have the perfect cup of ice coffee.Don't buy this machine!!!
1,I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item,"This Krups model is strictly mediocre. The expresso feature can not be used concurrently with the brew feature. Nore can the milk steamer be used while the brew feature is on, therefore you must brew coffee, turn off the coffee pot (thereby rebdering the coffee cold), turn on the milk frother or exresso maker, wait for it to warm up to make either expresso or steamed milk.....not a good system at all."
1,Beware of this machine!!!,"I made the mistake of purchasing this very nice looking expresso maker back in April. The coffee side is fine but the expresso side is hard to use and it clogged on me. Well, I sent it back to the regional service center on October 6th. Over 2 months later, the service center is STILL waiting on a part from Krups. What makes it worse is that I called Krups home office and they assured me that the part was mislabled by the computer and they would overnight it to the service center. Over a week has gone by and the part still hasn't been sent out nor have I heard anything from Krups. Everytime I call the home office I have to leave a voicemail! Do yourself a favor and spend a little more for the Briel...I wish I had!P.S. I finally got the machine back today, January 7th,2002...I hope it works"
2,Unhappy,"For the expensive price of this product, I would have expected a little more. Coffee grains get hung up under the pause spring all of the time, even though your filter is in properly.Also, I think for this price that is should come with a small coffee pot like their cheaper models have for under the espresso maker. The froth feature works very well, but is a bit hard to use. If push buttons were included on the front to froth with and so forth, it would be a much better product."
5,Excellent telescope for the new astronomer,"While many starting telescopes are cheap and flimsy, this one has high quality viewing and easy setup and operation, with a very sturdy telescope to boot. I have an 11 year old and have NO problem with him working with this, because it will easily hold up to his handling.For those new to astronomy, you can simply point this telescope at any object in the sky and see it very clearly. For those who start to get more advanced, you can use the included software to track down exactly what those things in the sky *are*, and easily get the telescope to track them as they move across the sky at night.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a high quality telescope in this price range. It's a great way to learn more about the night sky."
5,Scary Book....,This book is very scary only because it's true. The detail it goes into will surprise you. It tells you exactly what they saw!
3,Sick child,"I knew the family, and I thought the book was only so-so in presenting the story. It did not depict the family very well, many conclusions were drawn that were off base. It was written by an outsider and it shows in the presentation. A sick little boy who wants to be a hit man who is ignored by his parents who are too busy with their interests."
2,Arctic blips and bloops for your laptop,"I hate to be negative, but this purchase was a major letdown. I listened to samples, read these reviews, bought the (2CD) version on iTunes (after almost buying the 1CD version in an SF CD store today!). I frankly expected something a little more mysterious, majestic, deep, and warm. This reminds me of early Atari background music (think Tank). Well produced and programmed, but simply nothing to latch on to. And I'm a big fan of electronica and ambient! CD 1 is almost completely devoid of life, it's so cold...! It's like music for your Playstation to listen to...! CD 2 has a few good songs, with vocals...I chose this purchase instead of BT's new one, which was a mistake, unfortunately..."
5,Deep deep chillout,"The debut effort from Danish DJ Anders Trentemller is actually a bit of style-change for him. He is most known for his amazing remixes of various artist like Moby and Röyksopp, but his talent shines through on this album.The Last Resort is a complete album, every song seemes to belong and the mood is just amazing. Put it on when you need to chill out, when you're making dinner, when you're chatting up your girlfriend. This could very well be the perfect soundtrack of our lives...Every one of the stars is deserved one hundrede percent. Buy this album, you will not be disappointed!!"
4,"Anders Trentemoller is definitely talented, but...","I loved these tracks:Take Me Into Your SkinEvil DubAlways Something Better (all three versions)While The Cold Winter WaitingLike Two StrangersThe Very Last ResortMoan (instrumental only, vocal version seemed weak to me)Miss YouRykketidThese tracks I think are the true showcase of his talent and they definitely blow the vast majority of today's electronica out of the water. The rest of the tracks on both discs are of course layered and well done, but they just sound too dull, minimal and repetitive to me.If those other tracks that I haven't listed above were done by some other minimal producer who is not as big as Anders Trentemoller, let's just say for example Loco Dice - I honestly don't think that there would be this much talk about them."
1,Boring & uninspired,"When I first heard ""Le Champagne"" & ""In Progress"", both released on one 12"" on the west coast based Naked Music label..I was completely blown away.For me, they are the best house tracks i've heard in the last 20 years...hands down.I was hoping his other material was in a similar vein, but alas..it's NOT.This album has no developed musical ideas. All the tracks sound like ideas that were never fleshed-out and turned into actual pieces of music.Please Trentemoller...do some more tracks like ""Le Champagne""!!!!"
3,I'm not thrilled,"What is this? The reviews called this cutting edge, tasteful electronica. I found it to be old fashioned blips, bleeps, and bass lines. The production values are excellent but the music was dull. Many of these grooves never go anywhere. I wanted to like this album but found it boring. It won't be played again. Think of this as another of those dull ""Chill-out"" compilations that have one or two good tracks and lots of filler."
5,Good space saver.,This mounting hood allowed me to install my toaster oven above my washing machine. Installation was easy and it saved me about a square foot of counter space.
1,returned product,I bought this product through Amazon and returned it because it could not be used with toaster oven. I never received any refund.
1,Wrong information in advertisement. Poor return policy.,"The advertisement for this product clearly indicated it would fit the oven-toaster I own, and the only way I could tell it wouldn't fit was to open the box. The company policy does not accept returns once the box is opened. So.. I am stuck with a product I can't use and I am out $36.00."
1,Quit working in a few months.,"Ordered this on May 25. Now, only one of the 4 sides will toast. Have to put a piece of bread in, let it toast, then turn it around. Forget about using the other side!"
2,"Decent first drafts, but certainly not a publishable manuscript","Christl Verduyn, Silt (Guernica, 2002)Christl Verduyn's first collection almost gets there, but not quite. The characters, and the situations in which she places them, are interesting enough to hold the readers' interest, but the language is often awkward; language is, of course, the most important part of poetry. It's hard to imagine anyone writing the lines ""Water breaks/and oh! Rapture"" and still be surprised when someone pegs the poem for a piece out of the nineteenth century. At other times, the language is more subdued, but prosaic:""I sort rubber ringsstack extra lidsarrange my memoriesof you neatlyin vacuum packed jars...""(""Cold Storage"")There's a good deal of promise here, but this reads more like a first draft turned into a writing workshop than a finished, and published, manuscript. **"
5,Excellent Gift!!,"If you're a fan, this box set can go both ways. Either stupid because only two of the films inside have any real relation to each other, but what the hell it's Godzilla! It's a nice box art edition and the films included our very good ones, it just hold no relevance if you already own these films. However it makes a great gift set."
4,A Helpful Guide,This is a must resource for people dealing with individuals with disabilities and computers. It is the Definitive manual to help individuals with disabilities find the most appropriate way to access a computer.
4,Precious!,"Very sweet pictures, and very simple phrasing, this is adarling book for just learning to read older siblings, or anyone wholoves babies. The 9mth old baby in the book is just precious."
4,Heart wrenching,"Melody Carlson was able to put me in the shoes of the one who loves the addict. I felt her pain, frustration, indecision, guilt and need to help. Codependency is almost as bad as being dependent. Thank you Melody for sharing a truly amazing and moving story. A must read for any mother of an addict."
5,Delightful adventure of a darling Golden Retriever Puppy,This is a wonderful family film you will watch over and over and over! It's the story of a darling little puppy named Muffin who thinks he's destined to see the world and live as a wild dog! His adventure is based on an island off Australia and he meets many delightful friends! This is a fun animal adventure and nothing heart wrentching or awful happens so it's great for children of all ages as well as parents! It's also a great gift idea as everyone will enjoy it! It's very humerous and the voices are animated and refreshing! A truely fun endearing film that you will enjoy again and again!
4,Napoleon,"This film was an average childrens'film starring animals.It is quite unusual thoough because of the storyline and the hilarious scene where a dog starts to drown and the other dog calls out something along the lines of: ""Nyenci, Nyenci, please save Nyenci!"" I would buy it for this reason alone so go on and watch Nyenci drown in a fit of laughter! You know you want to! CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME CONSUME etc."
5,Great for the family,I think is a funny movie!It is about a golden Retriever named Muffin.His masters are having a birthday party. They have a small hot air balloon and Muffin jumps in it!He flies over the city and lands on an island.He now calls him self Napoleon like the great navagator.He's goal is to become a wild dog.He goes trew many avents like running into a cat on the island.He mets many friends. But you have watch the movie to see if he gets back home or makes he's goal come true! : )
5,LOVE IT!,I use to get this movie from red box EVERY weekend when I was younger and I found this movie here so I bought it. It's just the cutest movie!
3,Lots of Work,"I purchased this juicer after reading a book on fasting and self healing with juice. I thought it would be a breeze since there wasn't any food to cook or extra dishes to clean. I was wrong. There is so much prep time required with this machine. The fruit has to be peeled and cut to fit into the small opening. And cleaning the juicer requires more time. I thought i would stick in some fruit..get out juice and stick the washable parts in the dishwasher. Not so with this machine. But for the price i have to say it extracts the juice very well. Also, for the price, it's a win either way. I suggest buying a more powerful unit if you can afford it. If not...start peeling and cutting."
1,Two good books and now out there...know what you are buying,"Based on her two previous books ""Beyond the Twelve Steps: Roadmap to a New Life"" & ""Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting"" these were good books and fell within the bounds of my beliefs. But this book ""Earth II"" and the ""Dear God! What's Happening to Us?: Halting Eons of Manipulation"" Lynn has gone in a very different direction (or beyond what she hinted at previously). I am not saying the book is bad. I am just saying she has gone in a direction that is pretty far out there for me. So if you are buying the book based on the two previous ones I mentioned...you might want to reconsider or at least look for a used one on the cheap."
4,"If You Did Not Like DG, Don't Buy This One","More of Dear God. I loved it, but some of you may not. Although, I do believe spiders and snakes will be on Planet 2."
4,All start with a dream that Elizabeth turned true.,"This fascinating book is a valuable teaching and inspiring tool for people willing to start a business, who are looking for a real role model to motivate them in their goal achievement. It is even a guide for people willing to balance and improve their home and job relationships.""Dreams of an Immigrant"" will make you explore Paraguayan Elizabeth S. Steger, Ph. D., in her journey to success. There are passages that showed difficult moments as well the action applied to solve them.All start with a dream that Elizabeth turned true."
5,Very interesting,"I enjoyed this Documentary mainly because one of the persons was a local serial killer in the Rochester NY area, Arthur Shawcross. Interesting how the doctors describe persons with killing tendencies."
3,Actually Not Very Good,"This film discusses stranger murder. It covers a few of the most extreme cases of stranger murder in the USA in an exploitive way. In the USA there are about 22,000 homicides each year with most of them committed by guns. Over 80% of these homicides are not between strangers. Only a very small percentage of these homicides are sensational cases as discussed by this film.Due to lack of balance this film gives a wrong idea of the problem of homicides in the USA which is for the most part not between strangers. This film creates unnecessary fear."
4,A compelling look into the mind of criminal profiling,"This documentary is a compelling look inside the process of catching a serial killer through criminal profiling, it follows an FBI team on the hunt for Arthur Shawcross, the murderer of 11 prostitutes in Upstate New York, as well as touching on some other cases, including the Son of Sam Murders and others. It is interesting to watch how these FBI investigators can pin point an individual so throughly through profiling. The only complaint that I have about this documentary is that it, being made in 1992, is a little outdated, but never the less compelling."
4,A creepy film about creepy people.,"My husband and I watched this together. It's not long enough to keep you enthralled, but it is intriguing to delve into the minds of some of these psychos and see what makes them tick. NOVA does a good job as a documentary, but doesn't really go into depth about the makings of a serial killer, or the profiling of a serial killer. The film would have been much better had it been better researched and lengthier, but it is still a fascinating review of some of the famous serial killers of our time."
3,so so,the how many cups dial does not grind enough beans for my liking. flavor is weak unless i add to the actual cups being brewed. unit dosen't start all the time you have to play with the timer. i don't see a big improvement from the old blade grinder. it is convient that it holds alot of beans. i could take it or leave it. wouldn't buy another one
1,Dissapointing for a Bunn product,Replaced my old Krups when it finally wore out. Should have gotten another Krups. The grind is nowhere as good as the Krups. I have cleaned and taken the cutters out and checked them but does not matter. Have to turn the timer all the way about 3 to 4 times to get enough coffee to make a pot of coffee. Something I did with the Krups in a few seconds. Makes a good paperweight. Bunn should stck to coffeemakers. Love my commercial machine.
2,It grinds too coarse.,The Grinder is well made and we have had it for 5 years. But it never ground the coffee fine so you end up using more beans than you might with another product. We are retiring our Bunn. There is nothing more I would want than an american made coffee grinder. But this one is incapable of producing a fine grind for espresso.
5,Rock Solid Workhorse,"I did considerable research before I ordered the Bunn grinder. I knew I was not about to spend $200 plus for a grinder to make primarily drip coffee so my selection choices were limited. I decided on the Bunn and it has been everything I expected. It is not too large or too tall. It's heavy enough that it does not jiggle or move when grinding. And, best of all, it produces even, consistent grinds with no mess of coffee grounds or dust left around it on the cabinet. With the three year warranty, you can't go wrong."
4,"Great grinder, a little noisy","Got this grinder 6 months ago and thought I would give it some time before reviewing. So far it is working great. Love the cup setting dial. Just turn to how many cups you are brewing and it grinds the perfect amount (for us using a Bunn coffee maker, your strength needs may vary). The only reason I rate it 4 stars is because of the noise. This thing is very loud. If there are other people in the house sleeping you might want to grind your coffee the night before to avoid disturbing them. All in all a good coffee grinder."
1,"Surprisingly low quality, for a Bunn","I have nothing but respect for Bunn, usually. We swear by their coffee makers. But it's hard for me to believe this grinder is from the same company.The dial on the front -- which regulates the amount of coffee you grind -- feels fragile and flimsy, as if it might snap off.The dial for fineness of grind is inside the coffee bean chamber... UNDER the beans. If you want to adjust the grind once the beans are in there, you either have to empty the chamber, or feel around to turn the knob without being able to see where it's pointing.In our case that hardly mattered, because the grinder produced huge particles no matter what setting we used. I'm not talking about the coarse grind needed for French press -- rather, the pieces were about 1/8"". Clearly, it was defective.As others have mentioned, it was unusually noisy. Coffee grinders tend to be loud, but this one was abnormally loud."
3,Quieter but messy,"After reading reviews on Amazon, I decided to significantly upgrade our coffee grinder to this one from a Cuisinart. Love the fact that this grinder doesn't set our teeth on edge from high-pitched whine like our other grinder, and it does a very good job grinding our beans. I'm surprised that I need to clean ground coffee off our counter every morning, though. No one else mentioned this problem that I remember. A small leak lets grinds out where the bin meets the grinder during grinding. That, combined with the static from the plastic means a wet paper towel clean-up every time we grind. Annoying from a grinder that costs this much."
5,My Backpack's got jets...,I absolutely ADORE this CD! I am not a fan of Hip-hop at all...but this isn't the run of the mill crap on the radio. I put this album up there with Paul's Boutique...it is that good.
1,Skip the vocals,"The gutier is, as always a joy to hear, however the vocals are not. I wrote to Mr. butler and told him to keep up the music but, next time stick to instramentals. If you like his gutier try a different CD."
5,Insightful and uplifting!,"Jonathan wants us to experience the story of his life through this CD, to relive with him, his ups and downs, his highs and lows. Well, he has definitely accomplished what he set out to do. I felt as if I was beside him every step of the way. If you're a fan of Jonathan's, you won't be disappointed. If you've never listened to him and you're curious about his music, take a chance, I know you'll love it!"
2,Surprisingly Disappointed,"I am the biggest fan of Jonathan Butler however, this CD is not his best work. ""Do You Love Me"" as well as some other work in the past has been so outstanding that I was really disappointed with ""Story of Life"".I was expecting more great ballads like ""Do Love Me"", ""Life After You"", and ""Lost in Love""."
5,STORY OF LIFE,As usual Jonathan is wonderful his vocals are a refeshing change from the radio lets all sound the same music. Ive already got two nabors hooked on him and my 5 year old sons asks me to play this cd ever time we get in the car.Keep on making them like this Jonathan and you have our vote for life.
3,Will It Snow for Christmas?,"This is a nice enough movie and is enjoyable to watch. It centers on the lives of a small town and its children during a period of hard time. While there are a few topless scenes of one young girl, this movie should not be purchased for that reason. If you like old time stories about families struggling to make ends meet and how the lack of money effects everyone then take a look at this movie.As with all gatekeeper reviews, movies are reviewed solely for their nudity and violence content. Do not buy this movie if you are looking for nudity, you will be disappointed."
1,Poor support,I purchased a DS-60 for my son and have been trying to locate the accessories necessary to get it to perform with a motor since December. I have been unable to purchase the #493 series kit (not specified on the box as a necessary component)either online or at any stores. There is no online customer support and the information provided by the manufacturer was incorrect. The accessories for the telescope are not readily available. I am very dissatisfied with this product.
4,"Sins that are forgotten but not forgiven""","Reveals a tragedy (an internal cultural holocaust) that is too little known and that even this brave book does not tell completely. The war against Yiddish was part of a greater war against the Jewish diaspora and against the Eastern European roots of the bulk of the Jewsih population (even of the perpetrators themselves), a misguided effort to establish a ""new, bigger and better Jewish people"" and o besmirch and blot-out a 1000 year old civilization that Zionists disapproved of because it was unlike their own politicized views. This book must be read and supplemented by those still young enough to engage in self-criticism, uncomfortable though it may be."
2,"They're ok, but can be damaging","I purchased these screen protectors a while ago.... They work ok, but if your Jornada gets any tiny little invisible specks of dirt between the screen and the protector, you'll have scratches all over the place.... Just a warning....make sure you clean your Jornada before you place the protector on....and keep it clean.... Hope this helps!!!"
3,"Good idea, but...","Even when removing the green plastic from the screen protector, I still found two problems with it.1. It doesn't ""stay put"" on the screen. As another reviewer has mentioned, it can be challenging to write when your writing surface itself is not stationary. This just takes some getting used to, and isn't a big annoyance after a couple of days.2. It makes the Journada very difficult to see in outdoor lighting conditions. The plastic cover makes the screen much more glarey than before. Often times, the image becomes so washed-out that it is impossible to use without finding some shade. (Before, the screen was difficult to see outside, but not impossible).So, this is a great idea, but somewhat lacking in the execution. If you don't need to use the Journada in bright lighting conditions, or if you are very concerned about scratching the screen, then you should probably buy these. Otherwise, steer clear."
1,"Great idea, bad implementation","Would love to have a screen protector that works. This cover is very thick and it is very difficult to make the stylus function. After getting used to it, you can make do. The dark coloring makes it impossible to view on the indoor setting when under bright lighting. Outdoors it is much worse and very difficult to read even on the outdoor setting. Definitely avoid this one. I want my money back!"
3,A very scratchable anti-scratch protection,"Yes. Not a bad accessory, especially considering its price. But it gets scratched and marked very easy. A kind of sacrifice-surface that helps protect your Jornada screen glass. Six sheets will last three or four months, I think.Besides, I totally agree with several users on the point that HP could have documented better this accessory."
3,Great idea but needs some redesigning,"Having a screen protector on your PPC is a great idea, I wholeheartedly recommend getting one to keep the screen scratch-free. However, with the HP protectors, they could have done a better job with designing them. They aren't flexible sheets of film that adhere to the screen, but instead are more rigid sheets of plastic. I found that when freshly installed, the protector had a tendency to move around on the screen when I tried to write on it. Any dust under it actually scratched the underside of the protector. The PPC screen itself seems like it's still scratch-free. After rubbing my fingers across the top of it a few times, then wiping off the smudges with a soft cloth (don't press too hard), the resistance went away and it seemed to stay put when writing on it. HP should have designed them to fit a little more snuggly on the screen so they don't give me the impression that they could scratch the screen by their own movement."
4,"So THAT""S how it's done...","Kay, so here I was not only not using the ""green"" protectors, but I was peeling off the clear plastic thing and trying to stick that on my screen. It was like walking on a pool cover...darn near impossible.After reading the posts here I went and found that lo and behold, there is are TWO sides to the thick ""green"" protector. Peeled it off, slipped it in the screen area...voila..now I only hope it works.Also, does anyone know if there is a GPS device that fits into the expansion slot of the back of the jornada that converts it to a GPS device. Thanks,"
2,Jornada Screen Protectors,"Very disappointed. Protector reduces light too much, making it useless for my applications, especially when using it outdoors."
1,How would you like a green cover?,"I bought this screen protectors with my Jornada 548, and only found out that the protectors are actually in color green, though the picture...looks like that they're transparent. What kind of...designer will design a green cover over the screen to mess with all the color display? This is worst product I have ever use. BTW, I'm very satisfied with my Jornada 548."
3,Krylon Farm & Implement Spray Paint,"I love this brand paint because it does not drip and dries quickly. Once dry, it has a very low odor and in time completely disappears.However, if you are trying to even get a close much like I was, don't trust those people at the Krylon Corporation to help out. They'll tell you anything and unfortunately the school bus yellow wasn't even close. And don't trust their crumby color charts either. Since I have another project that I need to finish, the school bus yellow will be a great color. So now I won't buy unless I can see the cap on the paint can. The cap is very reliable when it comes to color matches. Rather than those awful color charts maybe they can use samples of colors made from the plastic that is used for the caps."
2,"Hi 5 ""WOW"" cd",Bought this for my grandson because he loves HI 5. But it was the Australian version. He didn't recognize the singers and the songs sounded different. What a disappointment!!
3,Was hoping for more detailed pictures.,"I was hoping for more detailed pictures of Yellin's work. While there are a lot of pictures in this book, most of them are large-scale (e.g. an entire gate) and do not focus on the interesting details of his work which would require more close-ups."
1,Negative Review,"I bought this reasonably priced toaster because I've always been pleased with Black & Decker quality. But this one's a real clunker! Toast either comes out burnt or not done enough. Setting ""3"" - it's not done, Setting 3 1/2"" - it's burnt. Obviously, I've never gone higher or lower on the settings. I'm thinking maybe ""3 1/4"" might work, if there was such a setting. Plus, on the rare occasions when I do get it right, toast comes out unevenly browned. To make matters worse, there's no cancel button, so as the black smoke is rising from your toast, you have to literally pull the plug to get it to pop out. (Trying to move setting to lowest point doesn't work.) I've tried toasting croissants, bread and bagels and have had the same problem with all."
4,A Book covers the detailed basic...,"I used this textbook for my C class. I found that this book covers the detailed basic. For a beginner, it is regarded a good book to start."
4,can't wait to see it on DVD!,"Me and my gf saw this LIVE in St. Louis. One major problem that night, the TNA-Tron worked for maybe two minutes of the Outsiders vs. The Dudley's. That was it. No ""inside the cage"" shots at all, whatsoever. This meant that anyone who didn't shell out the $50-$75 for floor seats barely got to see anything up close. I will buy this on DVD, so I can see all the awesome spots!Note to TNA: Make sure your video screen works for the next PPV away from Orlando. Because I spent $40 on each of our tickets and came away with really nothing like seeing a live event. Most other people would be pissed and wouldn't spend money on your product anymore over not being recognized as wanting to see the show that others who paid more got to see."
4,A Bright in Spot in a horrbile Promtion.,"TNA has a lot of problems, And Im not going to over them here. Only that this was one of the better shows theyve put on. Thiers some Dumb booking, but the Macthes are really good. Angle-Anderson is MOTY Canadtide, and would been better had it not been overbooked. But seriously scoop this baby up before it ends up in Vince's Video Libary."
4,Good Guide...,"After researching several books about rock hounding, I was pleased to find Mr. Streeter's book. I purchased the book as a retirement gift for a coworker and Mr. Streeter volunteered to autograph it. The book describes many sites to explore. I purchased the book in conjunction with Jacquot's Rock,Gem,Mineral Collecting in Western NC."
3,Out of date but informative,"This is an older book, but it at least includes color photos in the back that you can use to help identify your finds. Some of the information in the book is incorrect or outdated, particularly as pertains to the mines, but the book still has some limited usefulness."
4,I actualy own one.,"After reading Amazon.com's review and the two others listed, I took a chance and purchased this toaster because it is a cool idea. It works fine including the way it keeps the bread box cool, ( I know the guy complaining about stored bread getting warm doesn't own one and has never seen this toaster ). To my surprise it has a fan blowing cool air between the toaster and bread box, creating a very cool insulating air gap! It does make a noise similar to a computer fan only while it's toasting though...This is a cool toaster...excuse the pun."
4,Pleased. Good graphic/pictures of what you will see in Rome.,"I found this book useful learning what I will actually see in Rome. Lacking on pratical matters such as what to watch out, and the best see the Vatican etc."
4,Delightful guide,"This guide is great for giving you a sense of what Rome is like. It is not as detailed description wise as Lonely Planet, but the old saying ""a picture is worth a 1000 words"" applies here and this guide is loaded with pictures--every page."
4,The DK Series is the Best!,I have purchased several books from the DK series before traveling abroad. I love them and won't travel without them. The Rome book was very handy this past summer; it provides great information for self-tours. The pictures are great and it can be used as a souvenir when you return. :o)
3,"Beautiful Guidebook, but AS THE ROMANS DO Has More Soul","This is a sweet little guidebook if you are a tourist and are looking for factual information, but if you want something that gets into the heart of the city and its people--what it's really like to be in Rome and enjoy it like the Romans do, I would recommend AS THE ROMANS DO: THE DELIGHTS, DRAMAS AND DAILY DIVERSIONS OF LIFE IN THE ETERNAL CITY by Alan Epstein. I would give As the Romans Do five stars and a thumbs up. A Must Read"
4,Strong contender for best guide to Rome,"This is an excellent book in an excellent series. I used it in my first trip to Rome in 30 years and found it well organized and with excellent directions, addresses, etc. The drawbacks - it focuses tightly on central Rome. It lists a modest number of ""further afield"" attractions, but the maps don't give adequate coverage to the areas outside central Rome. The street, bus, subway and tram maps are not up to date after many changes for the 2000 Jubilee, and the area shown doesn't include maps for areas not in the heart of the city. As an example, the subway stop for the Vatican Museum is off the edge of the maps! In particular, there is no map of the entire subway, bus and tram network, so there is no clear sense of how to use the system to get to locations away from the center. Still, if you saw everything in the guide, you'd know a lot about Rome!"
5,"Informative, useful, and even entertaining","HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This book is widely used and for good reason--it presents a wealth of useful information in a terrific format. The colorful layout is excellent and the tips on everything from transportation to using phone machines is invaluable. The blurbs and photographs are very helpful and insightful. How popular is this book? While in Rome I saw this book being toted around by dozens of tourists, and the amusing thing was that often it was a non-English version. German tourists, French tourists, they all were carrying this around. The only thing from the book that wasn't up to par was the restaurant guide. I couldn't find some of the restaurants listed so it might be a little out of date in this area."
5,Fantastico!!!,"I found this book to be very interesting, user-friendly, and very descriptive in learning what to do and see while in Rome. I loved it!!! The summaries were short and to the point but very informative. Dorling Kindersly focuses on the highlights of each historical place. I embraced this book as one of the best travel-guide books. I will definitely want to add others to my travel collection."
3,not bad if you like the artists,"some songs are pretty basic,but ted nugent doing rag doll is worth a listen,ronnie james dio nearly makes dream on his own.nothing else really stands out.check out edgar winter on same old song and dance"
4,Better than you think !,"I'll admit straight away that the only reason I bought this was that Yngwie is on it. I'm not a fan of tribute albums and I didn't think this was going to be any different. Wrong! Perhaps it shows the quality of the original songs but this is really good. High points include Vince Neil giving it loads of attitude and, of course, Malmsteen and Dio on Dream On. I never thought that would work but it's brilliant. Low points - Ted Nugent doing Rag Doll, he's still as bad today as you remember."
2,Not whisper quiet.,"I got a couple of these at a great price, but be warned. This is not whisper quiet. In fact, it's plain loud and produces a slight drone; even when on the lowest setting."
3,Cheaper than the price of a filter,"You know this is not a super, excellent and amazing Air Purifier...But it's well worth if you are just trying to change a filter for your Air Purifier."
5,Easy to use Rice Cooker,"I have been using rice cookers for 20 years and this is the best one I have used. It is easy to use and clean. Smart details on the rice cooker made me decide to buy this one. Included is a spoon rest, vegetable steamer, and properly placed steam vents."
2,Marginally acceptable product for the price,"The glass top is vented, which prevents steam from spewing all over the outside of the rice cooker and the counter, as often happens with cheap rice cookers. Nonetheless, cooked rice sticks to the bottom of the pan. The product came missing a steam rack that was supposed to be included. Three emails to Aromaco's customer service department (listed on its website), and 2 phone calls, where I was put on hold for 45 and 60 minutes (before I gave up), yielded no results at all. For these reasons, I would not recommend buying this rice cooker."
2,"Works OK, but...","This rice cooker does a great job of cooking rice with one major, glaring problem: there is always a layer of rice stuck to the bottom of the cooking pan. I've tried increasing the water, coating the pan with butter or PAM, anything, and the bottom layer of the pan is always covered with a layer of burned-on rice. This is awful for actually making small amounts of rice, as you get a lot of waste thanks to it burning on. Otherwise, it works well. The rice that doesn't burn is tasty and it doesn't make a mess, and at least the pan is easy to clean, but the sticking to the bottom seriously makes this rice cooker something I wouldn't recommend buying."
5,You will love it!,"Completely different style from those I used to listen and I must say this is one of my favourite CDs I have ever bought. Elegant, powerful and romantic!"
1,a very strange book,"Ok, we aren't even sure if this is a kid book, we were reading it to our daughter and it's just weird..... First of all the characters are just strange and everything seems a little odd. The defense school seems a little violent..."
5,You should check out Duhe!,"Robin Duhe really does it with his debut album. It's jazzy, r & b, with much funk too. If you are a Frankie Beverly fan you will really enjoy ""Do It Duhe."" The songs can fit many moods that you may be in, from laid back to finger snapping to listening on the treadmill from stepping to these tunes."
2,BIlly Joel The Early Years,"buyer beware! this album is not an offical Billy Joel album it is a bootleg and not a good one at that.the $15 price tag is a rip off. I Thought this would be a good rarities like collection ,of early Billy Joel ,Hassels, Cold Spring Harbor demos etc.the songs are good but there is not enough.you can fit more than 9 songs on a cd.and the quality is so poor you can barely hear Billy sing and the low sound quality is hard to listen to.I like that I have demos of any Billy Joel .but it's the only good thing about this cd.your better off trying to find The Hassels best of that you may be able to find online.or the early vinyl copy of cold spring harbor.a 2 rating is being nice on this one."
2,A Disappointment,"Unfortunately, this book promises a lot more than it delivers. For example, in its preface, it mentions several families of potters at Acoma named Lewis not related to Lucy Lewis, but they are not even mentioned. Even the section on the family of Lucy Lewis is barely 2 pages. The author for the most part barely skims the surface. I desperately wanted to like this book, but the more I read it, the more I saw was lacking. For one thing, it seriously needed a much better editor. It reads like a grade school student's social studies report, and it is filled with typos, the worst being that many of the photo captions are wrong because the photos were flipped and the captions were not corrected. A major disappointment for the price. Fortunately I bought it in paperback! It did have some good information, but it could have and should have had much more."
4,Pueblo Pottery Families,The book provided insight into the relationships of the potters on the different pueblos. We like the book. It is inexpensive. We will have it available when we visit the different pueblos.
1,Awful Tasting Coffee,This coffeemaker makes the worse coffee I've ever had in my life! It tastes like the plastic chemical it's made from. I just wanted a simple coffeemaker when my 17 year old coffeemaker died. I just bought another brand of coffeemaker yesterday. What a difference! I can have a good tasting cup of coffee again that doesn't require me to drive to WaWa in the morning~
1,Can't Decant,Although the price on this item was fantastic after receiving it my husband and I were greatly dismayed to find that you cannot pour from the decanter without spilling the contents all over the counter top. You cannot pour water into the brewing receptical nor can you pour coffee into your cup without it spilling everywhere. We have had to resort to using the decanter from our old coffe maker on this machine. Either we received a lemon or the pour spout is poorly designed. Please pass out complaints along to the manufacturer.
1,Bad-tasting coffee,"My boyfriend bought this coffee maker to try and save on money---- he thought that it would be a good deal.However, he doesn't like it because it makes bad-tasting coffee. He says that the coffee tastes absolutely terrible. So he doesn't use it anymore.I am looking for another coffee maker as a replacement for him. I am looking for something that may cost a little more- but that will be worth it to us if it will make better-tasting coffee!"
1,It's going in the trash as soon as I get a replacement,"Within a week of purchasing this coffeemaker, the hinges that attach the door that covers the water receptacle broke off. The unit just seems like it doesn't fit together - there are wide gaps between sections of it, and doors have to be manipulated to go back to their original positions. I purchased this machine because of the ""programmable"" feature, but every time I turn the unit on to start brewing, it changes the time. This means that if I want to use the programmable feature, I have to first correct the time on the unit which is a nuisance. I wish I could find the receipt so I could get my money back."
2,The dribble cup of carafes,We have the basic Versabrew at work and it just boggles the mind that the engineering on this carafe made it through whatever Quality Assurance program B&D has. Maybe none based on this dribble cup carafe. There is no way to pour liquids out of this thing without it dribbling/leaking/spooshing down the side and bottom of it and all over the counter/floor/dog/shoes.Maybe this was their gag line of coffee makers?I give this two stars based on the fact that it does indeed make coffee. It gets an F- in engineering.
1,Can't Decant,Although the price on this item was fantastic after receiving it my husband and I were greatly dismayed to find that you cannot pour from the decanter without spilling the contents all over the counter top. You cannot pour water into the brewing receptical nor can you pour coffee into your cup without it spilling everywhere. We have had to resort to using the decanter from our old coffe maker on this machine. Either we received a lemon or the pour spout is poorly designed. Please pass our complaints along to the manufacturer.
2,Bad Design,I have owned this coffee maker for almost one year and cant wait for it to die. The coffee tastes okay but it is impossible to pour a cup of coffee without spilling it. I'm glad it didn't cost much because it is a poorly designed product.
2,Doesn't last long...,"This has all the bells and whistles I wanted, made decent coffee, just broke after less than a year ~ and it DOES drip when pouring unless you pour v-e-rrrrr-y slowly ~ I won't get another B&D coffeemaker :-("
1,Yaaaaaahhhhnnnnnn,"If you like the music on the weather channel,this one's for you.... Dated 70's style funk with sleepy vocals. Recommended for family members only..."
2,Returned,"I returned this. I was looking for something for my dachshund, he gets pretty beat up (they have really low-to-the-ground chests) but even the smallest size was way too large for him."
1,Don't buy it.,"I bought the Fellowes T7CM that is virtually identical to this unit. (confetti cut, 7 sheets at a time, 9"" opening, mesh basket) I fed it a couple of sheets at a time, no paper clips OR staples. This unit worked for two sessions and then stopped working permanently. (I have a GBC that has worked for years.)This unit is a piece of junk. Fellowes recommends that you run the shredder for no more than 2 minutes at a time and allow a 4 minute cool down time.I cannot recommend this item. It went back to the store for a refund."
1,Don't buy it.,"It worked for about 2 months, then got a slight jam and never recovered. Find something a bit more robust."
2,I give up!,"I have the Fellowes shredder #S701CM which looks just like this one. It's the second one I've gotten in the last 4 months. It's fun to use and I love the mesh basket so I can see what I've shredded and the layers of colors. The first one jammed up after a couple of weeks and it was dead. The second one seemed better, but it was probably because I was being more careful. But now it has jammed beyond the point of no return and I'm faced with buying another. As cute as this one is, the other reviews & my own experience are telling me to get real and find something else. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I had fun using it, but it really deserves only 1 star. =-("
1,Don't waste your money!,"We purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house. With all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft. At first it worked like a charm, but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason. We take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working. Then last week I added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke. Useless!!!"
5,great product,"this shredder is an animal! it shreds multiple papers at once, has a nice reverse function, and with the mesh basket you can ""see"" how much room you have left."
4,"Great, cheap shredder.","We had one of these for several years; it finally failed after chewing on a particularly large bunch of adhesive labels. My wife was very happy that the same model was still for sale, so we just bought another one. It's very compact, inexpensive, and works great for our personal use (shredding old credit card statements etc.)."
1,This shredder is worthless!!!!!,"After our first shredder died, we decided to try this one which is the cross shredder. It constantly jammed and we had to use tweezers to pull out the stuck pieces in the teeth before it would operate again. Now suddenly it has completely died. No amount of work on it will get it operating! Never again!"
3,Found a better option,"I kept this for three days or so. Nothing went terribly wrong with it except for a tendency to jam well short of the stated page rating, which I know is typical in this price range. A bit of slightly heavy paper left shards well stuck in the protective plastic fins where the shredded paper exits into the bin. Based on this, I agree with the other reviews indicating the plastic parts near the teeth are a design flaw and could prove to be reliability-challenged. I got a cheaper (after rebate) eight page medium duty shredder with more robust teeth and no plastic right in that area at an it's easy place, and am happy with that so far as an alternative."
1,Poor construction - plastic gears inside,"Heavy-duty motor is connected to a plastic gear. As soon as the shredder jams, the motor strips teeth off the plastic gear. Terrible design."
2,save your money,I bought this 7-8 months ago. Used it to shred NO MORE than 40 pieces of paper and it jammed and died. Money wasted. Never again will I buy a Fellowes shredder or product
4,Fellowes Powershred P70CM Shredder,"As with previous Fellowes products our household has owned, this seems to be of good quality. It runs fairly quietly and does a pretty good shredding job. 7 sheets at a time sometimes seems like too much for machine to handle, though, so I try to feed less in at a time, particularly if sheets are thicker."
4,good product,Arrived in about 1 week in good condition. However I find I can purchase these filters at my local Walmart store and not have to pay shipping charges.
5,The only filters to use,I use these filters in all my coffeemakers and are the ONLY ones that fit my Bunn O Matic thermal carafe coffee maker. The generic ones are not tall enough and are not thick enough paper to keep them from folding over in the non-Bunn coffeemaker or overflowing in the Bunn coffeemaker. BTW: our Target store has them for 96 cents for a box of 100.
3,The product could be better-so could the purchase,I'd like it if recycled and or bleach-free paper was used. As far as I am aware bunn doesn't have that available. It's a shame they don't. If we're all about coffee flavor I don't think bleach helps.Also I should have thought before about this but shipping is more expensive than the filters themselves. I purchased other items but they were not shipped together- my bad perhaps but it would be good to have them ship together.
1,Not pleased,I purchased a Bunn coffee maker and purchased the coffee filters to go along with the coffee maker. The filters were shipped separately and the shipping cost was almost three times the cost of the filters.My assumption was they would be shipped together. It would have been nice to have been advised they would ship separately.
1,Reality Check,I don't understand what everyone is so excited about. These filters are 97 cents in WalMart! Why would anyone pay these prices plus shipping? I think they're cheaper if you order them directly from Bunn.
1,Don't buy this product,"I returned this product as it was only one little box of 100 instead of a case of 10 boxes. It says 1 box, but it also says it weighs 2 1/2 pounds so I figured they really meant one case. Only an idiot would pay this much for one little box. I told them I was sure they had made an error, and they said they didn't. I had to pay shipping and 15% penalty for sending it back. I will never buy anything else from them again. I don't even know if I got credited to my accout yet. I won't be that idiot again. A rating of 1 is to high."
5,Spacious and easy to operate,Nice product. Spacious enough for multiple things. Takes 7 min in total (with 1100 watt microwave). Follow the instructions on the manual based on your microwave power.
2,Don't like it much!,I do not like this sterilizer. My large Nuk bottles do not fit in it at all and it has a strange odor when you take it out of the microwave. I would not recommend this item for purchase.
5,bang for you buck,"im glad i opted for this item rather than the expensive ones, it works well for all bottles sizes... for those who want to get the job done, yet not spend too much money...this is it!"
3,Will use with my 2nd child,"I found this to be an efficient sterilizer. I've had if for over a year and I used it a lot. However, the bottles that come with this are NOT BPA free, so if you buy this, throw out the bottles. I found out about BPA after my first child was just done using bottles and I used the ones that came with the sterilizer. SO, if you are safety aware like I now am I would not use the Soothie bottles. I will be throwing out all of mine."
5,Love it! Would buy again,"I LOVE this thing! It holds a lot more than you'd think & whether your bottle feeding or breast feeding, you need to constantly sterilize something. This is so much easier than running the dishwasher. I bottlefed & after each feeding I'd wash the bottles out then put them in this - once it was full, it takes 5 mins & everything is squeaky-clean! Takes up about the same amount of space on your counter as a large toaster & totally worth it. In addition to bottles & all the accessories, we used this to sterilize pacifiers, teething rings and almost anything plastic that my son was putting in his mouth. It worked out great & I would buy again & again"
1,Am I the only person who doesn't like the two piece pans?,Every cake I have baked has run out the bottom of pan. Some more than others but always some leakage. What happened to old timey one piece tube pans?
2,UGGGHHH!,"Maybe this sort of thing just isn't my taste but I bought the album based on a reccomendation from a friend and did not like it very much at all. There are a couple of moments on the CD that I like but on the whole it's incomprehensible and tough to listen to, if you like Korn I think you'll enjoy this one but it just isn't for me."
2,Sad But True,"I'm so sorry folks...Coal Chamber has let us all down. I said they were good to ""Coal Chamber"", but I just can't believe how much they've dropped down so far to a oceanic bottom level. The only good songs on there are ~sniffle~ Feed my dreams, My mercy...and that's ~sniffle~ about it. Please don't waste your money on this like I did mine. Well, actually my Grandma bought it for me...cool Grandma, eh? I think she is, only this cd stinks..."
4,coal chamber's best,"on this album coal chamber proof that they can write good songs and they're not only korn-clones. The first song (after the intro) was probably a big surprise to any coal chamber fan cuz on this one dez actually sings and it's not heavy all the way through. El cu cuy is a typical coal chamber song (allthough it is quite catchy)and that's how the albums goes on for another 14 songs. this record mixes ""normal"" coal chamber songs and experimental tracks with lots of sound effects and keyboards.A lot of poeple hated this one but I agree with the band. It's their best and most diverse album."
3,"Mah, It's Okay I guess......","Well what can I say about ""Chamber Music""? Oh yes, I LIKE THE FIRST ALBUM BETTER! There, straight and to the point. Most of the songs on the album are very melodic with a tad of metal running through them, but if you're just looking for the type of songs that are similar to their first album (""Coal Chamber""), then I recommend that you buy from an artist which is kinda similar, like Slipknot or something. My favorite song on the whole album was ""El Cu Cuy"", the rest just really didnt do it for me. I do personally prefer Dez's screaming on the last album."
1,More Neo Metal Trash,"Well... it is leaps and bounds better than their first cd. Still thats not saying much at all. The lyrics are still dumb. Dez's vocals are still flat and lifeless and Meegs guitars are still childlike. Their are many, many, many better albums out there to be. Pickup Slipknots self titled cd and Staind - Dysfunction. Both cds are so much better than this garbage."
5,a must buy cd,"this coal chamber album is 10 times better than the other. It's more melodic and still is heavier than their last album. dez fafara really shines through on his singing and also brings in some of the most adrenalized screaming i've heard since the deftones. My favorite songs are truth is like a tragedy, no home and entwined. If you have any albums from such bands as tool fear factory or machine head you are going to love this cd."
3,doesn't quite do it...,"this is one that could stand a little time in the chamber to think about what it did. This is Coal Chamber's least strong release. It's not bad, i guess, but their self titled debut and dark days are way better. I don't quite know what it is that I don't like about this CD, it just isn't as listenable as the other 2."
4,Much better than the first....,"I thought Coal Chamber sucked really bad when I heard their first cd. So, I thought it was risky listening to the second one. Man, it is good. The riffs are good, and the songs are much better structure-wise. Although the album is well sought-out, they still didn't rid the Korn-influenced sound, which bothers me. Maybe a few years ago when Korn's self-titled came out, would it be good. But now, since Korn blew it, it kinda gets annoying. But, I do like Dez's voice, and the cruncy guitars sound really cool on the album too. Mike's drums sound good, and so does Rayna's bass, even though she can't seem to play very well. Get this cd though. It's a good step up for an amatuer band."
2,Is tihs really Coal Chamber? :(,"If you buy this album hoping for an improvment on their debut, you will be sorely disappointed. First, Dez's voice seems to be damaged from touring, because he sounds nothing like he did 2 years ago. Second, with the exception of ""What's In Your Mind?"", none of the songs have any of the intensity of the first album. Either the band ""sold out"" and made an album for the radio, or their heart wasn't in making this project a success. Coal Chamber's new album isin't the worst I've heard, but it certainly isin't the best, and I much rather would have spent my money on MachineHead's new album."
4,Coal Chamber Sounds Better Than Ever,I didnt like coal chamber with their first release but this one is so much better it has its own sound but with the self titled album they sounded way to much like korn
3,This is a great album,"Coal Chamber returns with a great cd. It seems as if they are headed in the right direction by sort of moving away from that Korn sound, and mixing it with the Marilyn Manson sound, which has ended up landing them a great record. The Ozzy cover is good, but nothing compared to most of the other work on the cd. Coal Chamber are heading in the right direction. Thank god, because I am tired of everything sounding exactly like Korn."
2,Not good!,"I didn't think this cd was cool at all. The only song that i did like was ""shock the monkey"". i think i just wasted $15"
5,This is the best CD ever!,"At first when I picked up this Cd i thoguth it would just be another Korn rip off, but as soon as i listened to the first song(Mist) I realized that this group was very talented. Now this is my favorite CD! You should get this if you like music such as Korn or Marylin Manson"
3,Pretty Good,"This is an awesome cd, but it sounds too much like Korn, and all they sing about is death."
3,This cd is merely okay,"... While Chamber Music has it's share of ups, the downs tend to be more recognizable, which is sad because Coal Chamber is a very talented band. I loved how the self-titled made me laugh at times with the ""Amir of the Desert"" song and ""Clock"". In case you are wondering why the heck Clock made me laugh, if you listen to the lyric ""clock, it counts my fears"" ... Not only that but the self-titled was a lot heavier. Sure Chamber Music has a couple heavy songs like ""Tragedy"" ""Untrue"" and ""Entwined"" which is the only song I can remember where Dez screams longer than I've ever heard him scream before. I'm not saying this cd is bad persay, but for one it just gets really monotonous after awhile and the music just doesn't appeal to me as much as it should. Hopefully their follow-up to this one will be much better, because I really like Coal Chamber as a whole. It's sad though that they messed up on this one, but every band makes its mistakes."
5,Wonderful music!,"The CD ""Chamber Music"" really caught my ear. I listen to samples and decided I wanted it. What drew me in was the low, deep bass combined with rasping guitars and beating drums. The vocals are excellant, too. Fans of Soulfly, Korn, and Godsmack should cherish this CD for life."
4,Change in sound makes this effort stand out!!!!!!,"I HAVE LISTENED TO COAL CHAMBER FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS NOW. I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THEIR CD BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WERE OPENING FOR PANTERA AND THEIR CD WAS ON SALE. I WAS BLOW AWAY BY THE INTENSITY OF IT. THEY ARE ALSO ONE OF THE BEST LIVE BANDS I HAVE EVER SEEN. GREAT STAGE PRESENCE! CHAMBER MUSIC IS GREAT BECAUSE IT ISN'T THE SAME OLD SONGS REHASHED. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BAND IS CONCERNED ABOUT SOUNDING TOO MUCH LIKE EVERY OTHER DOWNTUNED BAND. I LIKE THAT FACT THAT DEZ SINGS A LOT MORE ON THIS ALBUM. THERE IS ALSO A MUCH BETTER DRUM PRESCENCE ON THIS ALBUM. SOME OF MY FAVORITES INCLUDE: TRAGEDY, SHARI VEGAS, NO HOME, TYLER'S SONG, AND EL CU CUY. GREAT ALBUM, GREAT BAND, LOVE THEIR NEW LOOK, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ALBUM"
2,A dissapointing second album,"coal chamber, what an awesome rock on band. but that was when i listened to their first album. i loved it, amazing, incredible!! but then when i brought chamber music i was dissapointed with the work, ""shock the monky"" is the only good track, and it was only good cuz of OZZY. i have only listend to this cd once and i was bored to tears. im sorry guys (and girls) but i think u rushed this one."
3,"Good CD, but what happened to Coal Chamber?","I was disappointed when I first listened to Chamber Music. I expected a mind blowing CD better than the first. I knew from the beginning there would be a change, when I saw their pic on the back of the CD...I thought I was looking at Orgy wannabees. When I first heard the CD it even sounded that way. It was a big difference from their debut. I had to listen to the songs over and over, as well as see them live and meet them (yes, I got my CDs autographed) before I started to like them. I think this CD would of been much better if it was by a different artist. It simply wasn't the Coal Chamber I know and love. I would still reccomend you buy this CD, but just beware, it will upset you at first. You need to grow to it."
5,This CD ROCK!,This CD is better if you listen to it the second time. THis is my first Coal CHamber CD and it was the best. I think i'm gonna buy the self title album too. Although the vocal are somewhat like KoRn but there's still some differences. THis CD absolutely rock! KoRn and Coal Chamber Rulez! (Limp bizkit too)
1,"No, just no.",...I couldn't listened to it all the way through. It is retarded... All of Coal Chamber is horrid and I suggest you never ever get involved with this band's music. They're just really bad.
5,WOW! I was impressed with this CD the moment...,"...I played it! Far surpassing their first album, which, don't get me wrong, is phenomenal! This CD, however, delivers alot more. The songs have more feeling behind them, and seem to tell more of a story than the ones in the first album. I discovered Coal Chamber kinda later than most people, but have been a fan now for like 3 years...LOVE THEM! I am really anticipating their next album, which I hope is out soon!"
5,Chamber Music vs Coal Chamber,Chamber Music (if you haven't heard) is a whole lot better than their first one. This is one of the best cd's out there; buy it!
1,GARBAGE,"avoid this cd at all costs. horrible. sounds just korn, limp bizkit, staind, tool, and all that ""new"" metal mumbo jumbo. AVOID!"
2,Repetition! Repetition! Repetition!,"This Cd while musicall interesting, provides no origniality in it's lyrics. Every song has the same lyrical pattern. Verse, chorus (repeated 4 times), verse, chorus, verse. Could we please get some originality here? Ozzy Ozbourne's appearance on the song ""Shock the Monkey"" is the only thing that salvages this album from one stardom."
3,"Chamber music, even the great OZZY could not save it...","A far cry from their self-titled debut, all the songs have the same feel and timing. This album lost much of Coal Chamberpersonality. What other band could pull of the song ""Big Truck""!!?? Back to the drawing board guys, you can do better than this, you did it before on your 1st album!!! Listen to some Meshuggah!"
4,Good CD,"I like this one a lot better than their first but would probably chop 5 songs. This leaves them with 11 good ones which is the average total of songs on a CD!!! The songs that are good are ""Really Good""! I can get by the weak ones and still give it 4 stars.Is it just me or does Ozzy sound kinda bad on ""Shock The Monkey?"" Anyways if you are a fan of the first one you might be disappointed...it all depends on your willingness to accept change."
5,This record has Rock and Goth,"I bought this record and instantly liked it. It's the best CD I own. My favorite song is ""My Mercy"" because of Ranya's backup singing. I also like how they put the first two songs together for a goth/rock kind of feel. This is a must buy. Everyone should own some Chamber Music."
5,... this will overshoot your expectations.,"This album completely blew me away. It is a lot different than their last one. On this new album they have tried a little more variety, and melody. The only thing that confused me is the song ""not living."" The song on the CD is not like the original, (which can be found on the soundtrack to Dee Snider's ""Strangeland."") The one from the soundtrack is much better than the one on Chamber Music, though it is still a kick-ass song. I think you'll enjoy this album more than the last one. It's definitely worth the money."
3,Where did the essence go?,"While the poems are indeed beautiful to the common reader who doesn't know Rumi well, in reality, Barks has done an awful job. Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi (may God be pleased with him) was one of the greatest Scholars in Islam and Barks has taken out all references to Islam from the poems (basically in every line).Nevertheless, Rumi's work still transcends Barks' unexplainable butchering of his poems."
4,Barks on Rumi,"They are many paths to Rumi, the Persian poet of god. Coleman Barks, though allegedly ignorant of Persian, has caught a fire which burns brightly in this rendition of Rumi. Coleman Barks channeling the "" Essential Rumi"" is a beautiful oasis. An oasis with many a languid pool filled with rhyme, insight and plain fun with words. Please do not let this charming channel stop your journey to the source."
5,the essential rumi,"Coleman Barks crafts scintillating translations of Rumi's ecstatic, poetic prayers. Speaking directly to the modern heart across centuries, Rumi captures the most poignant and mystical ways we seek to commune with a vast and unknowable creator who is at the same time an intimate companion, a friend. Wonderful prayers, poetry and parables bring Rumi's world to life, and enliven this life, injecting joyful surprise into the eternal mysteries."
5,Everyone should read Rumi ...,"It's Rumi. What can I say? How can I, a mere mortal, review Rumi? So let's just say this is an excellent compilation of his work and I received a used copy in great condition, exactly as described."
5,The Enchanting World of RUMI,"Discovering the ancient spiritual poet Rumi continues to be an enchanting journey into a completely novel world of poetry and inspiration. His work celebrates life and all creation -- he is simple and complex, wise with the heart of a child. Rumi is a unique treasuretrove of delight, love and the unfolding of a mystical friendship. By turns Rumi is reverant and is both sage and seeker.I highly recommend reading anything you can get your hands on by RUMI...if you are in despair or in love --you will be captivated and delighted by The Essential Rumi!!!"
2,I just can't get into it,"Loved Gibran's, The Prophet and bought this book after it was recommended as being similar. I just can't get into it. Sure, its a classic, but it is one of those books that need a study guide. The poetry is overshadowed by Rumi's relationship with another man; Shams. Was this a homosexual relationship? Was that why Rumi's son had Sham killed? Maybe I need to put the book away for a few decades and read it again later."
1,No Room For Rumi!,"The Essential Rumi is a timeless classic of total dribble. Maybe it lost something in the translation or maybe I just don't have the time to extract the few bits of philosophy concealed within Rumi's endless stream of rambling words. If you're looking for inspiration from the past, I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
5,This is not poetry as we know it in west,This is not just a collection of pomes. It is a commentary on life at the time it was written. The meanings of the pomes are in the most part straight forward. No tortured soul trying and failing to express them selves. There is a different style to the writting. The reader is encouraged to engage with the writer. It is like a conversation with the writer's voice heard by many. The other voice belongs to the reader and only they hear it. The subjects of the poems are as relevant today as they were all that time ago. It has been said that there are only five main storylines with many variasions. If this is true the Rumi was a master storyteller. To have a gift such as that was to be blessed.
2,A stoner dreams Rumi,"Coleman Barks knows no Persian; his poems can thus most charitably be described as inspired by Rumi. As such the book's title gives a false impression.Knowing no Persian either I am in no position to judge these poems against the real Rumi. Compared to other Mystics whom I do understand (like Meister Eckhardt, Jakob Boehme, Hildegard von Bingen) I get a sense that they try to describe the wonder of life, often in the small things, as well as the horror that is equally a part of it. This sense of depth and complexity is lacking in Mr. Barks' poems, they are saccharine in a 'Pop' way and like Pop can become quite grating after a while.On a positive note Coleman Barks has made me become interested in Rumi, so that's a plus, and he relies heavily on the works of Annemarie Schimmel who is indeed outstanding."
1,No Support!,It does not load properly--It doesn't appear to even be the right version of the program on the disc. ISMI sold it to antoher company and I can't get any support from the new company.
1,Cheaply Built - Connector Pins Are Very Easily Damaged,"I have both a Serial and USB cradle for the 540 series. Both are terribly disappointing pieces of junk.Within a matter of a few days of use, I now have bent pins on both cradles - rendering them useless - and preventing me from establlishing a connection to my desktop. (No, the there is nothing wrong with the female connector on the 548...)Upon examination I see the pins are VERY flimsy and under-engineered. For ... [the retail price] I expect HP to produce a much more robust product.Connectiong the PDA to a desktop is a critial and major function of the Pocket PC. Couldn't HP put 10 cents more into the manufacture of these cradles, so they could perform their vital function?I have had to ""fall-back"" to using the serial cable that came with the 548. The connector on that cable is much better made and should have a long life."
4,nice,Nice little unit. It's constructed pretty solidly and looks pretty handsome on the desk. A must have accessory.
1,one side toasting,"i just bought this toaster and i am returning it.it mostly only toasts one side.one side turns out perfct (top to bottom)while the other side is hardly even started to brown.it would and is good for bagels without even having a bagel setting.i also bought the betty crocker 4 slice last week and returned it,that was a really bad one it only browned one side and it burnt the top part and over cooked the middle and did'nt brown the bottom at all.well my search is still on.oh boy,for crying out loud it's a toaster,i can't belive how hard it is to find a good one.you would think it is a new invention and the kinks still need to be worked out.but i think what it is they are working hard to figure out to make them burn out quickly so you are forced to buy a new one often.that's just my opinion."
1,Sex Techniques for Virgins ONLY!,"If you have at least had sex one time in your entire life, you have mastered this video, now adays, this could be a sex education film for 6th grade elementery school children and even then, they probally know more about what to do then this video could teach the."
5,Perfect for a beginner,"As a beginner into the world of astronomy, the Meade DS70 EC coupled with the Autostar system makes an amazing telescope. The views of the moon, Saturn and other celestial objects are astounding. You can see Saturn very clearly (when your eyes get adjusted you will see the rings, colors and moons) and you will be able to see more detail with a 1.25"" Barlow lens or more highly powered eyepiece. Setting it up was hassle free except for the motors, which would not thread on properly (eventually they did).I would recommend this for any beginning astronomer. It is great!"
2,Don't expect to see much,Don't waste you time or money on this scope. The mount is very shaky and the images are dim and unexciting. The manual is also confusing. I'm going to sell it and get a bigger scope without all the gimmicky electronics.
4,Great Telescope for Beginners,"(...)Max Advertised Power was I think 250 but with the 9mm and 25mm lens you dont even get close which are the defaults that the telescope comes with. You have to buy the Barlow lens or the 4mm lens to see saturn.Over all for the (...)price its really great, but buying the lenses will cost an additional (dollar amount), so total comes to about (dollar amount), for that price this is the best in its class."
1,jules,"Still have not received the order/book. Tried to contact company the day after to let them know there had been a mix-up with the mailing address and they were mailing it to an incorrect address but have yet to hear back from them!! Not the easiest company to contact in case of a problem.. or perhaps they are not truly concerned with customer service or satisfaction. Unfortunate. Would not recommend them and would not order from them again in the future!! Would encourage others to stay away from them. MUCH easier to just deal with Amazon!! Very, Very unfortunate."
5,Simple and Good Food,"This is a great book at how to get started making your own camping food. Simple, less expensive, and better food!"
3,"Good book, poor editing","I used this book last semester when I taught Intro to Old Testament at a small liberal arts university in Ohio. Bowley is a good scholar and his literary approach in this text book is very useful. Also, I enjoyed the connections he makes between the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).However, I was sorely disappointed with the quality of the editing. For example, there is a place where the name of God is miss spelled in Hebrew. Further, the Hebrew heading for the chapter on Deuteronomy is also misspelled. Finally there are many errors in the English text. For as expensive as this book is and considering the publisher I think that the quality of the editing should have been much much better."
4,The Introduction to Hebrew Bible is not just a class text book,For those looking to expand their knowledge of the Old Testament this bookis a must! The Old Testament is challenging document and this book helps guide you thru. I believe there is so much to learn about the Old Testament and the Instruction to Hebrew Bible- A Guided Tour Of Israel's Sacred Library helps you on your quest for more knowledge.
3,Your money is better spent elsewhere,"Although this telescope is better than the ETX-90, it is still a bit too pricey. Your money is better spent elsewhere. If your serious about getting into amatuer astronomy, pick up an issue of Sky & Telescope or Astronomy, and look at the telescope ads they have throughout. You can pick out a telescope of much larger aperture for the same amount of money. For about 850 you can easily get a 10-inch Newtonian on a Dobsonian mount. Don't make any hasty decisions, shop around, trust me on this.Most people think that the purpose of telescopes is to magnify objects. That may be the purpose of microscopes, telescopes are used to gather light. Most of the interesting objects in the sky are too dim for us to see with our eyes, thus we use telescopes, preferably ones with wide objective lenses, to gather as much light as possible. Unfortunately, the ETX-125EC is a pretty bad value ."
4,Strong appliance,"I have had this mini chopper for 5 years and it is still going strong.I just bought a bigger and more expensive cuisinar model and waiting to receive it.Although small, it is kind of noisy.It does the job it is supposed to do for its size."
2,Too much work,"I received this chopper as a gift. Once assembled it works well. My biggest complaint is that the bowl requires some effort to remove or assemble, it must be positioned exactly on the base Also, the lid must be position correctly or it will not work...and it takes some getting use to to get it on correctly. The design could be better."
2,"Everything is great, but...","This chopper works very very well, and it minces things up very nicely. Some people have complained about the design, but I think the design isn't really the biggest problem. This chopper is VERY NOISY to the point that it makes my heart cringe. I tried using it on the first setting, but the sound is still very PIERCING. It's quite sad because it was cheap and works well. In other words, a near perfect chopper. But I can't bring myself to use it for the ~10 seconds to chop up my veggies. Give it a try. Maybe the noise won't bother you."
3,Slow but adequate features,The drive is a little slow and the Lightscribe feature prints are a little faded looking. I'd wait for the next generation of drives to arrive.
