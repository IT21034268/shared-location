1,Size does not match description,"This case had the exact features I was looking for at a good price. My only concern was whether the Lenovo 17"" laptop would fit. I confirmed the dimensions of the laptop I was ordering with Lenovo and also called McKleinUSA to confirm the size laptop that would fit this case. It seemed like it was a go. Unfortunately, the dimensions of the laptop sleeve and cavity in the case are smaller than advertised and the Lenovo 17"" did not fit.This was an unfortunate waste of everyone's time and effort."
2,Don't bother,"This book is about as bland as you get. It's not that it is poorly written. It's just that it is one of the most unimaginative books I've read. The plot is not new, nor is it presented in a particularly interesting way. I am not saying this book is bad (it really isn't). It just isn't good enough to merit using up the time necessary to read it."
5,Suberb Recording,"The orchestrations on this CD are more lilting than the movie's orchestrations, and Barabra Cook delivers on of the grandest Anna's of all time. FOR ANY 'THE KING AND I' FAN!"
3,Not what I expected,"I don't feel either comfortable or qualified to review this objectively. THE KING & I opened in 1951 and I got to know the music from the cast album then. Neither Gertrude Lawrence nor Yul Brynner was a trained singer -- rather, each relied on personality and acting ability to make their songs work. And R & H were writing for them anyway. Long story short, their distinctive voices and styles are burned into my brain and are the ONLY voices for these songs, at least for me.Now two extremely talented people come along to sing these same songs and neither of course is their predecessor. I love Barbara Cook and have followed her for years now -- but to my ear she is not Anna. I know Theodore Bikel less well but I do know he can sing too. But, for me, not the King of Siam.So, summing up, try someone else's review, someone who can be objective and review this set for what it is (and NOT for something it is NOT!)."
3,Pleasant but sterile studio cast recording.,"With the excuse of creating the first stereo recording of the work, Lehman Engel reworked the orchestrations, wrote a new overture and cast Barbara Cook and Theodore Bikel. This is an ""easy listening"" approach with poor characterizations, hardly any acting and no drama. The sound is fine but the music, lacking sensuality and drama as played, fails to delight. For purchase by Barbara Cook fans only."
3,Which Child is mine?,"I thought this book was okay, it was really good in the beginning. Like, you could really get a good picture of what was going on and what the characters were like. It was kinda like one of the books that you can't put down or stop reading. It had good detail and all, but then, more towards the end of the book, it got to much into detail of what Chase and Jillian would do together. So that kinda grossed me out. But otherwise I guess it was a good book."
4,Very Good Review and Reference Book,"This book was very useful in preparing for the PE and serves as a good reference during the exam. I would not bank on it as the only reference, but it serves as a good supporting reference book. There are no example problems in the book, and it simply covers the potential topics that might appear on the test in a very broad sense. It helps to target studying on topics that you might not use everyday or have not seen since undergrad. I recommend the purchase of the book, but would look for a used copy as it is rather pricey!"
2,2nd Edition is Worse than 1st Edition,"I borrowed my boss' first edition of this book before I bought the second edition. After reviewing each in good detail, it's clear that they are exactly the same content, except for one thing: the 2nd edition has no problems at the end of each chapter. Obviously the publisher wants you to buy the companion problems book. So, to be clear: the 2nd edition is worse than the 1st edition. Even by textbook industry standards, that's pretty bad!Yet, you need this book for the PE. So buy a gently used copy of the first edition and you'll both save money and get a superior product.Shores"
4,I just bought a second one,"Ideal for dry cleaning, canvass bag is convenient for the car, and quickly detaches. The second I will use for white washables and store color washables in my front load washer. Definitely not family size, but ideal for singles or couples, or as I typed, for dry cleaning.My laundry room is multifunctional w/ granite flooring, so something stylish was a must.Down side is that the screw covers do not even remotely match the nice color of the wood and do not fit snug. Obviously they will soon get lost."
1,Don't Doodle with the Doggie Doodle and Waste Digester,Does't digest what my dog has digested. No matter how much I used or hot moist I maintained it all I got was flies.
5,"Brilliant, Cool & Great","Just a flat out great collection of instrumentals that were once just backing soundtrack music but now lives on as a reminder of a time when every note was important - each track now lives on as: easy listening, bossa nova, 60's spy themes, class A jazz tracks, dance chill, or as loungey fun tracks. Each track is great in its own way and unveils the musicianship that takes you back to another time. Just great.P.S. - This is the first of a series of 10 volumes. There is another collection also entitled EASY TEMPO with a purple cover - NOT the same series!"
4,Toshiba Gigabeat F10L Mp3 Player,"I don't understand the negative reviews on this item. This player is great. Features and Price can't be beat. And it is very user friendly, so don't listen to those who complain about the controls or access to menus or sub-menus. The only flaw with this player, and it is a minor flaw, is that when playing a song and you stop the song and then back out to the main menu and then power off, the player goes right back to the last song being played when you turn the player back on.But as I said, this is a very minor issue. Over-all I would definitely recommend this player to anyone who wants the most bang for their buck."
2,Awful software,"The Gigabeat looks sharp and the sound is great but the software is horrible. The cradle doesn't work either on my home or work PC. The ""gigabeat room"" is not intuitive at all. To top it all off, the Gracenotes software crashes when it tries to connect with the Internet and I have to do a hard reboot. This means I have to enter all track info manually."
4,Great little nonstick pan,"I'd done a lot of research on nonstick pans before purchasing this pan, and I've not been disappointed at all with my purchase. I also have a Calphalon Professional Nonstick 12"", and the two together make a great team in my kitchen. The 10"" has a nice balance; I like the handle a lot, and the build quality and materials appear to be top notch. It's not quite as versatile as my 12"", but what it does do it handles with aplomb."
2,be careful with it,"I've owned this skillet for about a year and a half. After the first 3 months, I began to notice brownish dark areas around the handle. I'd assume that it's from uneven heating. Unfortunately the non-stick wasn't resilient to fork use (my roomate cooks with a fork, regardless of how many times I warn him not to) and I got a few scratches on the surface pretty early.After about a year of hand washing it, I got lazy one day and put it in the dishwasher. It pretty much tore up the non-stick coating. So in about a year and a half of usage, I'm retiring it.Overall, it was a good pan for the price. It did everything well when it was in good condition. The handle was always cool/warm during cooking. I did some no-oil egg cooking a few times when it was new. In hindsight (or in 20/20 vision...), I'd prolly get a Calphalon since they're non-stick masters and I haven't heard any complaints from my friend who has one."
3,Milleniumware 2000,"The Faberware non-stick fry pan proves to be one of the best items for cooking those stubborn job dishes with little or no mess. This was given to me and my husband as a wedding gift from cousins Barbara, Jeanie and Devan. Thanks so much!"
5,Totally great music,"You can't go wrong in getting this CD from Chris Bocast. His etheral music sets the mood. I particularly like how it provides an environment that is condusive to creative thinking, stargazing and all around relaxing. The songs, while all different, dovetail each other - and produces a seamless stream of music, like a good conversation with a trusted friend. If you want something good, something different, something not of this world, you won't go wrong in adding this one to your collection."
5,This one's a keeper!,"Introduce yourself to the world of classic films if you haven't done it already. THE LONG GRAY LINE is a fine, nostalgic old film, wonderful for watching on a cold winter's night. Yes, it's sentimental, but it's a good kind of sentiment, and you'll get a look at some of the finest actors and one of the finest directors of the era. This is the story of Martin Maher, the big-hearted Irish immigrant who began at West Point by breaking dishes and ended as one of the most beloved instructors of the institution. You'll be treated to fine actors such as Tyrone Power and Maureen O'Hara, legends of their time, as well as director John Ford (perhaps most renowned for his work with John Wayne). Give it a try."
2,Long Gray Line,The movie overall is really a great story; the quality of the DVD is what really is what I find as poor quality. It's almost as though some one copied it using a video camera recorder. I already own a copy of the VHS tape and it is a far better version of the film. The actors are classics. I can only say good things about Maureen O'Hara and Tyrone Powers. Ward Bond also. There were others who were in supporting roles who deserve mention; still the story is one that really what is s classic piece of Americana that deserves remembering.
5,Classic Movie,A wonderful true story by an outstanding cast about a time in the history of one of our greatest military institutions. A true joy to watch!
4,DVD Movie,Got the videos in a very timely manner and they were all new and in new packaging. Was very pleases with the whole transaction.
5,Great Movie,Great Movie have not seen in a long time that;s why I bought it would suggested it for anyone who love military movies.
2,Sentimental yuck,"Absolutely John Ford's worst movie, this story of an Irish immigrant who became an institution as a coach at West Point is an embarrassing mish-mash of saccharine sentimentality, Irish ethnic stereotypes, shallow patriotic cliche, cardboard characterizations, and buffoonish low humor. It embodies all of Ford's faults and none of his strengths: even the visual framing of the scenes, something Ford is usually an instinctive master of, seems pedestrian. Why some critics have praised the performances is beyond me: the actors give the sort of performance which lets you know they're really acting. To be fair, this film is a sentimental favorite and has many fans, but I myself could hardly keep a straight face watching it. I can recommend it only to Ford fans who want to see all of his work. The Sony 2002 DVD transfer is good, with a full screen version on one side and widescreen on the other."
5,"Again, Awesome!","Simply stated, it's great music. If you have, ""I Am Here Now"", and you think the songs are the same, think again. Some are mixed differently, like ""Misery."" ""Blue Ray"" is chilling. Just order this... IF YOU CAN FIND IT! :)"
3,Not the best,"I've owned this skillet for only 2 years. So far I've noticed that it does not heat evenly (and I cook with gas, so I'm not dealing with testy electric ranges), even nylon utensels scratch its ""non-stick"" surface, a lot sticks to this non-stick. One could not cook eggs without first buttering or otherwise greasing this pan. Finally after 2 years, right in the center (where the heat is concentrated I'll assume), the non-stick coating is coming off. Now previously, this was a decent fry pan. If you were cooking something greasy like burgers or bacon, this will be just fine for a few years, but plan on replacing this. The reason I gave this 3 stars is that it is pretty good out of the box, its inexpensive for your first fry pan, and if you're just starting out or have limited funds, by all means get this frypan. However Calphalon makes an excellent pan the same size that will last you a lifetime for little more."
2,"amazingly ""safe""","Totally safe, formulaic, and predictable symphonic progressive with some mainstream rock moves (ala Supertramp). It does feature loads of nice Mellotron, but enjoyment from that is sometimes canceled out by some truly wretched guitar tone (sounds like the early digital processing that would become popular in the 80's). About the most interesting (or amusing) thing this has going for it is the vocals sounding uncannily like Dan McCafferty of Nazareth in places. There is nothing that strikes me as being particularly original, memorable, or exciting here. One for the ""trade pile""."
1,What a Rip-Off,This is not Qi Gong at all; it is some very simple yoga. Not worth the money I paid for the DVD.
5,Pete is the man,Pete Townshend is of course a musical genius but he is also a very terrific writer Life house is a little better than Horse's Neck.But any one who is a fan of the who should buy this book and add it to their WHO collection.
5,Review of Sony 1 GB High Speed Memory Stick PRO Media,"It is a new tool for me as a photographer and I really love it.Great speed and capacity make it very usefull. I would buy evenlarger capacity but unfortunatelly the price is too high, almosthigher then my camera."
4,Neck Towles,"absolutely lloovvveee this product, i run a salon and these towel neck strips are waayyyy better then the normal paper ones."
2,Review this product,"Disapointed,Have a larger barrel brush byJilbere ceramic Brush. does a much better job. Get's much hotter and does a better job of curling."
2,Wish it got hotter,"I like the simple setting of high, low, or off. Who really needs 30 different heat settings? This is not a quick 90 second heat up, and is not as effective at curling my hair as other brands I've used. However, with that said, there are not alot of curling brush irons to choose from out there."
1,Big rip-off,"$99.99 list price? Over $70 actual price? You've got to be kidding! I'm glad we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend, but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance. If you want to connect your iPod to your home stereo, get a $7.00 ""stereo mini-plug to RCA plug Y-adapter"" at Radio Shack. That's all you need. You already have a recharger (it came with your iPod), so the only advantage this kit has over the inexpensive Radio Shack option is holding your iPod upright. I have this item (it came free with my 40GB iPod) and, although it offers a slight convenience over not having it, I think the price is outrageous."
1,DON'T BUY THIS !!!!,"This is basically a 1/8"" male to RCA cable for $73; you could get the same exact cable for $5.99 at Radio Shack. Yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out; not worth it. Buy the cable at RS; it'll work EXACTLY the same.. don't be fooled. If you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately; you'll save major $$$..."
2,Specs aren't 100% correct,"I purchased this and am not impressed. Note that ""works with all click wheel iPods"" isn't true. It does NOT work with photo iPods (at least the 60 GB model). I'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit. I'm ordering a 'photo dock' since I can't see any way to get a cover that is made for the 60GB/photo model.If I'd known this, I'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately, since I already have a charger (came with it...). Grr. :-)"
1,does not charge iphone,"While it does disable the volume of the player so you can use your stereo volume, it does not permit charging to the iphone. seems lame that it would charge an ipod but not the ipad or the iphone. oh and it's so freaking expensive. We are returning it."
4,Price is OK,"I don't know what those other reviewers are talking about when they write that the price is outrageous, but if you are looking for a solution that includes the dock, power brick, and cables than this will save you about $5 - $10. I don't know about the retail price being $99 as listed here, but from what I've been able to find, this is an OK deal for what it includes."
5,Dock your 'Pod and Rock your Crib!,"Just place the iPod Dock in a convenient spot, plug in the iPod Power Adapter and connect it to the dock with the supplied iPod Dock Connector to FireWire Cable. Plug the Monster Cable into the mini-stereo line out connection on the back of the dock and then into any available audio input on a home stereo receiver. Dock your iPod and rock the house!This kit includes everything you need to connect iPod with Click Wheel or iPod mini to a home stereo system.Includes:iPod DockiPod Power AdapteriPod Dock Connector to FireWire CableMonster Cable Mini-Stereo to RCA CableBring your music library into your living room. This kit includes everything you need to connect your iPod to your home stereo including a Monster Cable audio cable. Supports iPod models with Dock Connector. Does not support iPod shuffle."
5,Ellis Island,"I have searched for the ""Ellis Island"" video for years. I am so pleased to finally receive it. The quality is good and the service outstanding. It is just as good as I remember from 25 years ago. Thank you!"
4,All in one place,"If you are Episcopalian or of some other church that may use the 1979 Prayer book, you will find this very useful for public worship. I have personally found it very nice for devotional use. If you want to use the Prayer Book's daily office lectionary to read a LOT of scripture every day, now you have them both in one place - along with all the prayers of the Prayer Book. I also would imagine that lots of ministers may find this useful when doing visits and going to hospitals and such. My only complaint is that it is a bit bulky - maybe they could release a 'slimmed down version' without the concordance or the Apocrypha. This is a very nice ""all-in-one"" volume. The leather edition looks pretty good and I was really surprised how well mine lays open even on pages near the beginning or the end."
5,Super Devotional and Study Tool,Here is a wonderful devotional and 'spiritual fortification tool' for modern Christians. Seeking deeper walk with the Lord? Feel shackled by today's shallow Christianity? Don't know if you can find a handy all-in-one DEEP spiritual tool for personal growth? Do not discount the BCP/NRSV...here you have all the above and more. This is the STURDY hardback edition and it is well made and worth the great price.
3,Make sure to get the right one,"It's hard to tell from this fuzzy picture if this is exactly the same model I got, but it looks like it. One type fits over the existing cover, another actually replaces it. My problems were with the 1st type -- the screw needs to be long enough to go through the existing plate plus this. Mine weren't, and of course the item doesn't come with it's own screw -- so, trip back to the hardware store. Then, I use heavy guage power strips - the holes at the bottom of my model were much to narrow for anything but the narrowest cord to fit. So, pull plate off and start from scratch. Be careful what type you get -- the one that replaces the outlet cover works much easier."
1,cheap and not sturdy,these are not good. They are more like what you would find in a 99 store. The covers do not stay on and the plastic is poor quality and warped. Get the Saftey 1st product instead.
3,Good for the novice smoker,The humidor serves its purpose in holding up to 20 cigars and keeping them moist. One change that I will definitely make to the humidor is the hygrometer. I believe the hygrometer is the only real drawback to going cheap with the purchased product. The seller did a good job of getting the humidifier to me in the mail and it was in good condition.
5,Great value,"This was a fantactic first humidor. Nice dark exterior, good cedar liner, inexpensive, good seal. The only knock is the velcro that attackhes the humidifier to the interior, it peels off a little too easily. It is still perfect for someone who takes extended trips as I do, and it's inobtrusive and elegant enough for the home."
4,Very good for the price,"If you are a new cigar aficionado, this humidor will work out well. For the more distinguished cigar smoker, this may not be what you are looking for unless you are looking for a low price."
4,"Wonderful, above Adequate CD!","THIS CD IS GREAT. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW CLICKING SOUNDS, ITS WONDERFUL. YUP"
4,No 10 rating because there was only 1 song I like!,"I am not really a Titanic nut but I love Celine Dion's music. She was really great with ""My heart will go on"" A good CD. I guess I should have bought a single of just ""My heart will go on"" It's not really worth it unless you like the music with no words!"
3,"Enjoyable, but flawed","Overall, this is an enjoyable album that is worth purchasing. The playing is refined and elegant, and it succeeds in conveying the atmosphere of a tea room or lounge on the doomed ship. But, there are a number of areas where the recording could have been improved:- Many of the songs are represented only by the chorus, with the verses being completely absent. ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart"", for instance, runs through the chorus 3 times, with slightly varying orchestration, but never do we hear the verse.- The string playing is pretty poor with regard to intonation. Passages where multiple strings are (supposedly) in unison come off a little harsh. Maybe that was the authentic way string players sounded back then? Doubtful.- The newly composed material that bookends the authentic original music is rather discordant in style. I found myself just playing the middle tracks, skipping the first and last two."
4,The perfect atmosphere,"Got this for a Titanic-theme dinner party to play while we dined. On the surround sound, felt like the band was there. Only thing that would have made it better would have been even more music on the CD. (The contemporary pieces at start and end were nice bookends, but not period pieces.)"
5,I love it,"The CD ""Music aboard the Titanic"" contents a lot of songs and fashion music works from beginning of XX century. It's a very happy and relaxating music."
3,good to entertain children,"This has parts form several gospels plus lots more, not very authoritative, in fact some may get an incomplete message if they watch this to learn about The LORD Jesus Christ."
1,Flies in the ointment,"There is a proverb that says 'flies make the perfumer's oil stink.'The film the Miracle Maker is such a work of art. It can do nothing but edify the minds of children.Saying that though I can not fathom how the producers and distributors of this film can degrade this work with the filthy advertising put with this film.It was my joy to give this dvd out but now I regret giving it simply because of the sick advertising that goes with it.Mark up a win for commercialism.Addendum:I still can't resist wanting to get this precious film in the hands of people. It is a valuable source to introduce people to the Lord. Still, I warn people of the nonsense they have to avoid to before watching the film."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"My children weren't captivated by the movie at all which is very unusual. They love others like Ten Commandments, prince of Egypt and Joseph king of dreams but not this one. :("
5,The Miracle Maker,"Excellent animation, voices and graphics, it's a new-technology way to tell an ageless story. I really enjoyed this format. I recommend it highly, for all ages."
5,A Beautiful Experience,"One of the best told presentations of the Story of Christ. Masterfully orchestrated by the Animators, Actors, Directors, Scenic Artists, and the whole team at FILMIAU S4C Films.The stop motion animation and figures are so realistic you will think they are human. Amazing work by EVERYONE who worked on this film. The BEST!"
1,This movie makes Jesus look like nothing but a prophet,"Really disappointed with this. I saw the great reviews and love for this movie, the high quality of work that was put in to it so I bought it. The facts are all skewed and they make Jesus look like He claimed to be no more than a prophet. Then He just vanishes, we don't see Him accend to Heaven, and everyone concludes that the Kingdom of God is in our hearts, which is partly true, but they leave out that where He is going, He is preparing a place for us and will come again. So sad..."
4,Very Good Family Easter movie,"I teach 6th grade Religious Ed. And I am always looking for good movies that are within the Catholic based beliefs. This movie was highly recommended by Relevant Radio (a Catholic Radio Station)as a good family movie. I no longer have children at home, but my husband and I enjoyed the movie. It is animated but very well done. I also really enjoy the ""making of the movie."""
1,Arian Jesus - be careful what ur kids watch,"Some will & have commented regarding the wonderful animation & remake this is. While this may or may not be true, the fundamental issue is do you want your kids to watch a heretical poorly displayed Arian Jesus who lies in the first scene & is portrayed as a reluctant human.For those who do not know this type of heresy, its the belief that Christ wad a mere human until his baptism and only then became some superior human. Kids are confused enough nowadays with everything to confuse them more with who Jesus is - the ever existing only begotten son of God. I'd try to sell this used but would hate to be responsible for any viewer becoming confused. :-)"
5,Wonderful,This is a wonderful representation of the life of Jesus. It is beautifully done- I highly recommend it. It is a perfect family movie-not too childish (note to anyone looking for something a bit more in depth than the Beginners' Bible animated movies)so it held my attention and still easy enough to follow for the under seven group. The combination of claymation and animation is very appealing.
4,"Claymation, but moving","It has all the benefits and limits of clamation. Yet, the characters are engaging. It focuses on the deliverance, feeding and healing ministry of Jesus."
5,3 year old Grandson loves this series!!!,"This entire ""There goes..."" series is a wonderful learning tool that captivates my Grandson's interest. Very well done and teaches new vocabulary and in-depth subject learning. I believe we have all the tapes, Firetruck, Helicopter, Monster Truck, etc. They will sit for the entire video capitvated at age three!!!!"
1,Pure Trash,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this cookware. The teflon will peel off in less than 3 years. The 20 year guarantee is a hoax.If you try to get a replacement, they will direct you to some TV repair company [and] you will[be charged for] a new pot. I've been contacting them for 5 years now with no success."
4,Good Pans,"They look nice, but show water spots if not dried properly (they're so shiney). Cooking with them is good, so far have noticed no uneven heating and they're pretty durable. I've had a few problems cooking with the fry pan, things sticking, but it's not a non stick pan, so that will happen depending on what is being cooked. I'd reccommend them if you can get a good deal on the set like I did...The stock pot is probably my favorite pan in the whole set. It's a nice size and the lid fits so well."
4,This is the one I've been waiting for as cookware,"I've been looking for something useful and long-lasting as cookware for a long time. Many companies sell a lot of kinds of cookware-set, but some of them are usually just useless or charging a lot of money. Even I find something I like, I don't think I would use all of the sets in the future. Some of pots or pans are too small or too large, e.t.c. This Farberware Millennium Stainless Steel 10-Piece Cookware Set has all sorts of sizes and usefulness. I think I can use all of this set all the time for cooking because of good designs and qualities. I like non-stick pans or pots,too, but I still like stainless pans or pots a lot because I know they last for a very long time. I really recommend everybody to try this set. I believe this would be one of good investments as a great chef at home."
4,tough deal to beat,"I've been using them for a while now, and there is a little bit of discoloration on the bottoms of the pots I use the most. The insides still look like new and clean up easy.I gave the set a 4 out of 5 because the handles get very hot. That said you would be hard pressed to find a better set in the same price range."
1,"This movie is BOOOOORING, BUT LOLA FLORES IS WONDERFUL","I did not know what this movie was about??? Even though I love Lola Flores, I found this movie very boring and even the songs that were selected were not that good. Specially, the last number was long and very boring. And then it ended."
4,Imported compilation,"Misstress Barbara has officially realesed 2 albums... this is not one of them. This album is exclusively included in the Trust the DJ collection. It is still a fantastic trance album but it includes a few titles from her second album (Relentless Beats volume 2)... This album has 18 songs but 8 of them are included in her second album. Even with the repetition of some songs, it is still a collection to own. Misstress Barbara is one of the best DJs of her generation."
4,Samplers can be hit or miss,"This is a sampler. the good is they have remixes ,tracks : 1)Consolidated - Crackhouse (more music mix) 6:41 , 5) Severed Heads - The Tingler (itch-E & scratch E remix) 3:52 , 7)MC 900 Jesus -Dancing Barefoot (remix)4:25 , 8)Single Gun Theory - I AM What I See (the new Delhi remix/edit)4:50 . Hope this helps"
2,John cena not number 1,"oh my god john cena isnt number 1 i think hell froze over, thats amazing hes not, are u finally realising john cena is the only wrestler you have vince, yay!!!"
2,"Jerry lawlers piledriver was nothing compared to Paul ordorff, and george the animal steele hammer lock is not here",Jerry lawlers piledriver was nothing compared to Paul ordorff's.second where is george the animal Steele's hammer lock the was brutal.Kerry Von Erich the claw ? Wher is barron Von Rasctke? Underwhelmed by the list
5,WHAT? NO! NO! NO!,"HELL NO! Chris Beniot aka the murding S.O.B. is not and should not be on this are anyother future dvds. Now the Jerry and Paul piledriver debat i just got to say WHAT? Have you ever felt anyone of there piledrivers, so how do you know who is the best. I guess when you make a dvd like this people will complain about it. P.S. Chris Beniot is in HELL FIRE, and yes i do know this because the HOLY BIBLE says THERE IS NO FORGIVENESS FOR TAKING YOUR OWN LIFE, and if you don't like that well then tough."
5,Great Shredder,This shredder works great. It is also very quiet compared to a lot of shredders we have tried in the past.
1,Fellowes PS-70 shredder,"I am seriously unhappy with this shredder. I have one, same make and model. Had purchased this for my son to replace his smaller one. Just unpacked and set it up yesterday, April 6th, ran one 4-sheet pass through it, and it sounds like a threshing machine....like something is badly worn. Mine is several years old, heavily used, and does not make this noise. I have not had time to contact Amazon yet regarding the problem, but wish to package and return this item. If the review may also serve as notification, well and good, and please respond with instructions for its return. I still have the original packing, will not set it out for trash collection. I have been away most days, no free time until evenings, so was going to try contacting Amazom Friday or Saturday, when I hope to be home.Thank you.Please send to my email address, cg629@outdrs.net"
2,I hate this da#n thing...,"Some idiot bought this for my office; the waste bin is a rickety, 2-part ordeal that's split down the middle for some odd reason. Also, there's no handgrabs or handles or anywhere to put your fingers and lift the shredder mechanism off (see photo). The shredder mechanism fits flushly against the bin. When I put it down today, I pinched my finger between the bin and the mechanism, and I've got a huge blood blister now and it hurt like hell. This thing is rickety and dangerous!"
1,Poor quality.,"This arrived in terrible condition. The box was old and worn and awful. I was going to use this as a gift for someone who has cancer, but it will end up at Goodwill."
3,Scott Abel,1problem is you already charged fer the one head sent at 800 sum bucks and your tryin to double charge 1699 fer second charge right it will go through
4,Fabulously Bad,"I remember seeing this movie 20 years ago or so on late-night TV, and despite being low-budget, campy and dated, it still managed to creep me out. The film-makers never take themselves too seriously, and I was happy to find it for sale on DVD."
3,Children shouldn't play with dead thing's,I would have to say that for a movie made in 1972 that it was not bad. I find that there was not enough zombies killing humans. But like i said not bad. If you are a hardcore zombie fan like me than you should buy it.
3,Good fun-Mixed feelings,"I must say that the thing that drove me to purchase this movie was-apart from my being a zombi-a-cholic- the title itself. The overall feeling I got from the movie was mixed. On the one hand I felt like I could gather a bunch of friends and make a movie such as this (based on the acting, photography and technical aspects)and on the other hand I appreciated the effort (amazingly well-crafted makeup given the date of the film, good plot strokes). The actors were having a great time doing the film and the ""order of killing"" was a pleasant surprise. It's no Dawn of the Dead, that's for sure and it doesn't intend to be, but I saw in it the forefather of the Return of the Living Dead series."
3,A Fair Flick- Worth a Look!,"Pure 70's horror camp! Wonderful! If you are a fan of these type of films, this one is definitely your style. If you are a zombie fan, it is also worth a peek. I found the ending to be extremely creepy..."
4,Very good to scare a new date or just great movie fun.,"When I saw this fright fest, I was about 8 or 9 years old. My idea of the images being shown kept me awake for at least a week. I can't wait to see it again."
2,"Well, its pretty bad","so bad its almost good. Almost. The ""dead things"" looked terribly fake, the dialogue (what little there was) was generally unamusing and there were no creative plot twistsI did like one thing however: the lack of theme music. It gives the viewer the most overwhelming sense of insecurity, being that foreshadowing with creepy instrumentals is a crutch for horror film watchers. In this one, the creatures just jump out at you without notice"
3,i'm a fan of living dead movies,"I 1st saw this movie when I was about 11. It creeped the hell out of me but left a lasting impression. I've always thought that this movie is really the prequel to ""NOTLD"". If you liked ""NOTLD"" then this movie is a must. I've looked high & low for this movie for years. Luckily for me I decided to try ""amazon"" and was happy with the quick delivery."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"I get what the director was trying to do, I get the Manson references, I understand that this film was painfully low-budget. But so was Night of the Living Dead, and it had plot movement. Over an hour into a 90 minute movie, there was still little or no action, and huge diatribes from each of the overacting stars made up the bulk of the movie. Finally, mercifully, zombies put an end to all of the useless tired dialog, but not soon enough to save the film."
4,THE DEAD ARE COMING FOR US.,"I first saw this movie some 20 years ago on a TV show called "" CREATURE FEATURE"" and thought it was really cool than. supposedly, this takes place on an island where some movie director and his crew of wanna be actors arrive on and 2 of his crew take the caretaker hostage while he tries to concoct a plan to raise the dead while reading some verse from a book. This is considered to be a joke and Alan and his guys dig up a dead body to bring to the cottage their staying in to poke fun at it until the dead start to rise and the real fun begins."
1,Digitally Restored my....,"VCI's new 35th Anniversary Edition of CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS is a big dissapointment, as they have used a trimmed print with splices and faded colors. How can this happen when their previous DVD release was uncut and had better colors? I am not stating this to bash VCI (a company I actually like and has done some great stuff), but because they made a big mistake here by releasing this print and hyping it as a major ""special edition!"" Do not buy it, but rather, e-mail and call VCI and ask that they PLEASE recall the disc and re-do it!"
3,"Downright Creepy, a suprise!!!","I am a fan of the zombie genre. I just got around to seeing this one as it is one of those little talked about unknowns, outside of horror fan circles anyway. I am really suprised at how good it was. Ofcourse the actually directing and acting are laughable..But the ending zombie massacre was superior!!!The zombies rising out of the grave scene was one of the best I have seen.One note about some other reviews. When you read others say this is a rip-off of George Romero,don't listen. It gets tiresome when people who don't know anything about horror films compare EVERY zombie film to Romero's mediocre work. I can name lots of zombie films that are tons better than Romero's laughable blue make-up zombies. 'Zombie' and 'Burial Ground' being a few.Enjoy it for what it is, a small effort by unknowns, and keep Romero out of the picture and you might enjoy it. 3 and 1/2 stars."
4,children shouldnt play with dead things,a cool flick for when it was made back in the days its a really good party movie throw pop corn at the screen NO WAY you will be hooked the last 20 mins is great a must have for any horror fan
2,Dated and Amateurish Zombies,"I had heard good things about this film but had never seen it. In its day, it had a reputation as being a scary movie. Sadly, it has not aged well and I found it more silly than scary. The acting is quite poor and annoyingly amateurish. The plot is a rehash of Night of the Living Dead. The makeup was probably good for its day, but looks obvious and false now. It's worth a rental if you have enough beer to anesthetize your inner critic. It is not worth buying unless your cousin is in it."
1,Where is my barf bag?,"No, I don't want to barf because of any gore in this B-cheese, but because the movie is so horrible.The flick takes FOREVER to get to the point, the zombies look terrible, and when you finish watching this garbage, you feel cheated -- out of two precious hours of life that have been wasted on this pile of dung.I can't believe that the same man who is responsible for PORKY'S and A CHRISTMAS STORY was behind this turkey. ""Turkey,"" heh heh. Calling this movie a ""turkey"" is being NICE.STEER CLEAR OF THIS RUBBISH!!!!"
2,FOR REAL ZOMBIE FANS ONLY!,"This one is very dated. If you really love Zombie movies, you might enjoy this, but don't blame me if you don't."
5,FINALLY WITH BONUS FEATURES!,I have always been a fan of this movie!I am glad to hear a few of the cast members will be doing a commentary!Buy this dvd classic 70s drive-in fave!
2,"I HEAR A FOG HORN BLOWING ! boooooring , boooooring.","Can you ask for a movie any worse than this. The acting the music the camera. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting will make you laugh though so if you want to laugh rent this but don't buy it.I can't believe someone out there said this was scary. It's just a big yawn. The gore isn't even good. This film is far past low budget.I wasted so much of my life watching this film. I would know because I own more than 40 horror movies but this just sickened me, you can't even call this horror. So don't make the same mistake I did, a cover isn't everything!"
5,Great 70's horror,"I really like this movie. There's not a whole lot of action for about the first hour. The focus is on character development. But I found the dialog to be very engaging and clever, and I also thought the humor was genuinely funny. The acting is also pretty good for a B movie. There's a lot of buildup to the climax of the film, which really delivers.If you like this one, also check out ""Deranged"" (1974), an Ed Gein based horror movie that Alan Ormsby also worked on."
3,cheesy but worth watching!,"You take away the absence of production values, amature acting, bad dialouge and you got a pretty decent horror pic. That withstanding, Children Shouldnt Play with Dead Things is an underated zombie flick considering it was made with almost no budget. Why? Alan Ormsby gives one of the most annoying performances in B-movie history! Its only fitting that the viewer is treated to his death by the zombie he digs up and mocks! The zombie effects are surprisingly effective, creating some scary looking zombies that work to give a genuine creepiness about the film. A film worth watching for the horror fan."
1,Restored? Oh Sure!,"I won't even get into details but there is absolutely no comparison between this and the 1999 release. The latter is the best copy available and this supposedly-superior-restored-35th-anniversary release is a joke. The only aspect I can see that might be a bit better is the brightness of colors. Big deal. The transfer is ridiculously grainy and supposedly certain scenes have been edited (I haven't sat through it so I wouldn't know yet). This is a cult classic that deserves a full restoration and one that should be done correctly. However, it's obvious no company is going to spend the cash to do it. Such a shame.In the end, the box states ""35th anniversary exhumed edition"". It should've stayed buried."
5,GREATEST HORROR MOVIE IN THE WORLD,"I LOVED IT, IT SPOOKED ME OUT, AND IT DIDN'T WASTE TIME WITH A PLOT, I JUST WENT ON MAKING YOU LAUGH AT TIMES AND SCARING THE HELL OUT OF YOU AT OTHERS, THE MAKEUP EFFECTS WERE IN MY OPINION BETTER THAN THE EFFECTS I'VE SEEN IN A LOT OF LIVING DEAD MOVIES, OF COURSE, I FEEL THAT TOGETHER THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD CREW AND THE CHILDREN CREW COULD MAKE AN AWESOME ZOMBIE MOVIE, THESE ZOMBIES WERE ACTUALLY SCARY, THE FOG SEQUENCE WAS AWESOME.I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT ON DVD."
3,Sick Movie,"This is one of those movies that you watch and than ask WHY? A real horror classic.It is so stupid that it is a cool fun movie to watch.I first saw this movie about 25 yrs ago and taped it to VHS and still pull it out when I need a good laugh.Hoping Amazon gets more copies,as the tape isn't holding up"
1,Maybe a hypnotist could help me forget a painful 87 min.,"With the reputation of the talent behind the camera, I thought I would give this cheapie a look. Bob Clark (Deathdream, Black Christmas) delivers what has to be the worst horror film in the history of cinema. That's okay though. Most directors have a film they are ashamed of. Clark specializes in perfect pacing but that quality is not present here. It also doesn't help that Alan Ormsby is like fingernails on the chalkboard, with his overwrought, dare I say ""performance."" This is worth seeing, if only to learn about casting no-no's."
1,Gives B movies a bad name....,I really like B movies. Bloodsucking Pharoes in Pittsburg is one of my all time favorites. This movie though. This movie made Frogs seem fantastic. It is horrible. Save your cash and your time!!
2,George Romero Ripoff!!,"I like cheesy b zombie movies but I just couldn't help thinking that the people behind this movie were just trying to make a cheap buck on the back of the great zombie master George A. Romero. and they probably were. That aside, this movie was alright although the acting won't win any awards and those costumes. Don't you just love the 70's. All in all an below average zombie movie but I guess I don't mind too much."
1,D A T E D and camper than charles haughtrey & julian clary's illegitimate love child,"if your local amateur dramatic society got together to make a fun horror movie it would look like this. that's if the society were particularly bad and dominated by mr camp mccampy the campiest camp man since camp began who chose to be particularly campy even by his camp standards in this outing. this may well have been a ""seminal"" moment in horror history however you are being asked to buy this product now. avoid. unless you really like camp."
1,people shouldn't have made this movie...,i have to say this movie really was terrible. i could hardly get through it.
3,Oh So 70's !!!!,"A VERY dated movie that SCREAMS 70's DISCO fashion!!! The acting is pretty bad,the pace is slow, but the story is decent overall. It would be 1000 times better if it were remade with some decent actors, better special effects, and a little more action.Overall, it is entertaining, but if you can rent it on netflix instead of buying..... DO SO!"
4,Great twist for a zombie flick.,"A very few zombie movies go in this direction.Not so much gore, but the plot stays strong till the end."
4,"For what this film intends to do, it's very effective","This is a sort of visual debate about the relative merits of brains versus brawn in an isolated environment. The zombies are really just the stimulus for the creation of the emotional context of the film which gives rise to the subtle yet complete shift in the balance of power within the stranded group. The unique twist in this film is that the empowerment of the socially awkward, yet brainy antagonist, if you will, is usurped by the more classic male type character in the end, which is very atypical for a horror film. (...).I'd buy it again."
5,"THE Greatest Zombie flick of all time (including ""Titanic"")","Director/Writer/Actor Alan Ormsby went WAY over the top with this one. A group of Hippies goes to a loney island to perform a Satanic ritual and get MUCH, MUCH more than they barganed for. Great dialog, special effects (check out Alan's red, white, & blue pants), & acting. And all on a shoe-string budget. Also check out Alan's other masterpiece ""Deathdream""."
4,frightening to me as a child,"I saw it on tv when I was about 10 years old. It frightened me, but I'd like to see it again."
4,Hippos & Rhinos & Humans OH MY!,"This DVD is a great introduction to a couple of mammals that we don't often hear much about...Hippos & Rhinos! They're actually quite adorable and they get into some funny situations in this Animal Planet DVD. My favorite segment is the one where Cleo, a Hippo at Busch Gardens gives birth to her new baby. My kids loved this whole DVD!"
3,mis- leading add,"I was looking to buy a 15 inch. laminator. I didn't read anywhere in this add that the unit only laminated 9"". I know the cost is low, but I found similar prices on Ebay some time ago. the add is very misleading,, just be sure that you know this only laminates width of 9 inches. When I received the machine and took it out of the box, it seemed very sturdy, i would buy it if i were looking for a small unit. I am waiting for refund. (the add may be changed to represent the product better)."
2,Amazon sucks for video online,"1st, I'm usually a fan of Amazon as well as a fan of The Closer. Not tonight. I'll never use Amazon video online again. Maybe it's my computer, which I find hard to fathom, maybe it's Amazon but whatever it was throughout the entire episode it kept stopping to download. Extremely annoying! Re: this episode, not the best. They're usually really good cops; on this episode they were idiots and extremely horrible shots! I hope the next episode shows them all at a shooting range!"
1,Where's the HD sized content?,This video is letterboxed inside a SD sized area on an HD screen. Very disappointed. Needs to be widescreen.
1,Show great delivery horrible,The show was good. Exactly what I would expect from a 4th season show. What is horrible about this 'product' is the Unbox feature used to d/l and view it. The Unbox help menu is very limited and there is no way to stage the videos waiting in quene. Those are small flaws. The major flaws are 1. d/l time is pathetic. Almost a hour for the the approx. 45 min. show and 2. I can't import or play this on an ipod product. The only reason I purchased this episode was it was not on iTunes like last season. I hope iTunes does eventually carry this season because The Closer on Amazon Unbox is a giant step backwards.
1,Close it up,"I stopped watching at season 3. Brenda's parents were in every episode and it was all about her and Fritz and their love/hate relationship (based soley on Brenda's constant selfishness). The first two seasons were awesome, but alas this series jumped the shark all too soon and stopped taking itself seriously.5 24 11: I started watching again and apparently the writers and directors read my reviews coz they whipped it back in shape! Yes thanks to me!"
3,Second try worked out better,"The first set we got was completely mangled. The DVD's were okay but the case was crushed, I get it's probably not Amazon's fault but I did emial them and they sent another one out immediately. The second one was fine."
3,Not as good as the first 3 seasons,"Another pretty good season of the Closer.But the final 4 or 5 episodes are not as good anymore.All the wedding, parents, fritzy and family stuff is totally boring andannoying."
5,I love this show!!,I have all six seasons of this show and can't wait to get season seven!! I am addicted to Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson and her gang especially Flynn and Provenza. I've also got my cousin hooked on it and I recently gave Season 1 to my next door neighbour and I'm waiting to hear if she's now and addict as well :)
5,Closer to perfection,"This series seems to get better and better..It has the right amount of pathos thrown in with the blackest of comedies.Brenda and her team face a tough season, as they are asked to allow a reporter to tag along, who along the way manages to throw a spanner in the works of the Proirity Homicide unit. Not only this, but a memeber of the team also has to deal with a personal loss, and with all that going on Brenda and Fitz are about to tie the knot.The dvd extra's are a bit dissapointing, as there aren't any interviews with the cast and only a few behind the scenes and a funny gag reel..but having said this it's worth buying..trust me you won't be dissapointed.. and in the word of Brenda Lee Johnson 'thank you..thank you very much'!"
5,The Closer: The Complete Fourth Season,"The set of DVD's arrived when scheduled and in good condition. We are very satisfied with their quality, cost, delivery and content."
5,season 4 the closer,It arrived on time and in good shape. So far no problem with the discs. I have watched the first two.
5,"I loved the show, happy with the packaging","I liked the fact that all 4discs were in one case and it had the summaries of each episode, so I don't have to guess which disc to watch."
5,The Closer - 4th season,Getting a little long in the tooth but still one of the best. The cast is simply fantastic.
5,One of the Best Series,The Closer is a show that will keep you on the edge of your seat! Kyra Sedwick is amazing. Her character Deputy chief Brenda Lee Johnson will have you in awe at the way she powerfully closes her case and in the next few minutes she is a weeping and emotional wreck at home.This series shows a head-strong determined WOMAN at work and let's other women know it is okay to let go and have a melt down if need be but probably not a work.I have order every season and have fallen in love with each character. The cast is awesome and will keep you in stitches.
5,Great Series,Characters in this series are believable. Stories are always intriguing. Excellent acting. Exciting plots with humor mixed in.Much better than today's crime series.
5,Brilliant,"Very fast shipping. Amazing prices. Will use them any time I can. Also, the show is quite good and I would recommend it to anyone who is a police drama fan."
3,"Sorry, but I don't want to review Prof. Rescher's book.","Instead, I just want to give you information about a ""misprint"" in his book: Unfortunately, on page 164, note 6 a paper of mine is cited incorrectly.The corrected source is:Theodor Leiber ""Chaos, Berechnungskomplexität und Physik: Neue Grenzen wissenschaftlicher Erkenntnis?"" Philosophia Naturalis, vol. 33 (1996), pp. 23-54With best regardsTheodor Leiber"
2,wont work,"I bought this lil gadget because I have my FAVORITE keyboard but of course its not usb and most of my computers need a usb keyboard so was excited I found this..but I plugged it into sony viao and no keyboard will work with it,so disappointed but was worth a try for the money."
3,"Works with mice, not with keyboards","This adapter is perfect for those wishing to connect a ps/2 mouse to a usb-enabled motherboard; however, since keyboards require more voltage than mice, they often do not work with such adapters.I tried this adapter with several IBM and Microsoft keyboards on several different machines, and none of the keyboards worked. They receive power, but not enough to function properly. I'm not sure if other, more expensive, adapters will allow one to connect ps/2 keyboards to usb ports. I may need to give in and simply buy a modern keyboard!"
2,Should have read the other review - didn't work with my keyboard,"This doesn't work with my keyboard. I was hoping this would be a good option instead of having to buy a brand new keyboard. I guess that it has to do with the amount of voltage required to power the keyboard and not really this device's fault, but just the same it should be advertised as a mouse adapter."
1,Dont waste your time,"did not work with my mouse. Tried on a few different computers with no success. contacted seller and sent another type of connector right away. It was an ""active"" adapter so that one I am able to use."
2,NOT FOR PS/2 KEYBOARDS!!!,"I gambled, for the $4 plus shipping. Bad me. This adapter physically fits the connector, but does not work electronically for keyboards. As others have said, if you have a PS/2 keyboard look at other adapters with the correct electronics."
3,"Works, but not how i wanted",I'm assuming it works. I didn't read the other reviews. And like everyone else said it does not work with a keyboard.
4,Decent ice shaver,"I bought this ice shaver not long ago. I find out it is easy to use. Drop some ice tubes, push the top, turn the crank and you really can get fluffy ice shavings. But it is pretty slow. If you need lot of ice shavings it is going to take you some time."
2,NOT EVEN A CLOSE SHAVE,"Hate to be a crank about this but the crank or handle is very difficult to turn. Once some sort of momentum is established the ice isn't shaved but ""chunked.""We wanted to make sno cones or slushies but were disappointed that we couldn't produce either with this shaver. Better results were achieved by breaking the ice with a hammer.Perhaps this one shaver just had had a flaw - we don't know."
5,Great!,I use this to show my students in a college level Psychology course. They enjoy it and it creates lots of conversation about personality and attraction.
3,Hard stuff,"The book is well written but you have to be a professional mathematician or a math major at the very least to understand it. By the third page, they are already doing complicated integrals and number theory that can leave you standing in the dust."
5,Pretty darn amazing,"This book does so many things well, that I would get bored trying to explain them all. What really impressed me was the explanation of the Euler-Lagrange equation. What is incredible about the treatment is that it is so easy to understand but doesn't leave out any of the math. For anyone trying to teach themselves the calculus of variations I recommend this book as an intro before jumping into a textbook."
3,max deserves better,"This recording is probably the best example of Max Roach's work with string quartet, but it is unfortunately marred by digital recording flaws throughout. A thorough remastering and then a reissue is called for here."
3,thunder81650,She is very good but j loe really played her very well as selena.I hope they come up with another selena
1,"Over the top Garbage for Foreign Film Lovers/FilmClass Rejects,Beast With a Gun-Snoozefest.","Thanks to Netflix(which for some reason keeps offering garbage)I saw this snoozefest,all the shock,schlock and violence couldn't keep my attention on it.The Killer is some blondefairy looking dude who looks more like an spoiled brat than some Violent sociopath,Only the Police and the beautiful yet kind of old and not in a cougar-y way gets the movie passing along.The car chase is semi-exciting,although Alfa-Romeo's are not exiciting cars;I've seen better Italian Cinema."
1,In short....,"Revisionist spreading FUD as retribution for his dismissal after being caught in his misrepresentation. The ""Da Vinci Code"" of WWII literature."
1,Cliche-ridden suds,"This novel of a man's complex passion for two women is disappointingly conventional, written in the tone of a dime store romance novel. Where are the insights into the volatile 1960s and into relationships between the sexes? The cliches snowball as the story progresses, or should I say regresses... Barbara Cartland where are you?"
2,NOT VERY ENJOYABLE,"""Honor Thy Wife"" is another one of those novels that begins good, and then does not seem to go anywhere.Terry Brett is a lawyer, who meets and falls in love with Allison. Allison is the BAD girl with a heart of gold.Valerie Holland is a pediatrician who is also in love with Terry-Terry is also in love with Valerie.At some point in the novel, honor they wife comes into play, but I did not get far enough into the novel to find out.The book just seemed to drag on.I don't know what kind of novel this is supposed to be...The synopsis reads as a Jackie Collins novel, but it is far from it.It had the ingredients to be a good book, but just took too long to put them to use."
1,I Tried to Get Into It,"50 pages in I was still scratching my head hoping for this story to pick up. I can see the foundation of a story, but not one that would hold my interest. The relationship between Allison and Terry feels forced and contrite- the lawyer is going ""slumming"" and just enjoys the naughtiness of it. I'd love to be able to stay with it longer to see what the other reviewers are seeing, but I can only see the whole thing dragging on like this, a 150 page story drawn out into 443.My copy is going back to the library."
4,A Soap Opera for Men,"As I read this book I kept telling my husband that it's written for men who like soap operas. The best thing about this novel is that I never became entirely sympathetic to any of its characters so there wasn't that ""worry"" that a favorite would come to a disasterous ending. At times, I wished they all would. And yet, I kept reading... The book held my attention and not once did I check out how many more pages I had to read until the ending, which is my own ratings system for evaluating a book."
3,"Good hook, but lots of fluff.",I have provided a track listing since there was none as of this writing:1 - Can You Dig It?2 - Can You Dig It? [Cut La Roc Remix]3 - Can You Dig It? [Bulletproof Dirty Dub]4 - Can You Dig It? [Radio Edit]It's a big beat kind of song that plays with some elements of other genres like acid house and piano. Of course the remixes go a little further. The Cut La Roc and Bulletproof remixes put the song more like a club standard. Personally I think everything but the Radio Edit is either too long or too redundant. Considering the current price I still say this album is worth it because the Radio Edit gives you all the best of the song without all the filler.
5,This book changed my life!,"This is one the most amazing and user friendly guides for selective mutism. By using Mrs. Kervatt's effective system, I was able to get a selectively mute child in my 1st grade classroom to speak by the end of the year. What a well thought out and planned guide. I cannot recommend this highly enough!"
3,Not What I Expected . . .,This was just not what I had expected especially for the price. I am not criticizing the content - it just did not meet my needs.Thank You.
2,Not a lot of book for the money.,"My 5 year old daughter has Selective Mutism. I found other books more helpful and not as costly. I expected more from this book from reading other reviews. When I received the package, I got a stack of paper spiral bound. The first few pages had some useful information, but the same information was found on the web under Selective Mutism. Returned within a day of delivery."
4,"Very Readable, but not enough information","I bought this book in hopes of getting a variety of strategies to use with a selective mute student on my caseload. I found this book very readable and engaging, but I didn't find enough strategies for it to be as useful as I'd hoped. It did give a nice overview of selective mutism and did a fabulous job of illustrating that it is not intentional misbehavior, but rather an unusual reaction to anxiety. Because of this, I find it very useful to share with parents and other professionals. However, I did not find the variety of strategies I was looking for."
5,An Answer to a Prayer!,"My 5 year old son is in kindergarten and has selective mutism. I found that The Silence Within and The Supplement are excellent resources for parents and especially for schools. His teacher was so thankful to receive books that have great examples of useful research based strategies and even forms to use. No other books on selective mutism have tangible examples like these. The Silence Within demonstrates the ""fading in"" strategy on a daily basis, illustrating many very useful ideas and materials for implementing a school plan in a nonthreatening game-like setting. Kudos to Mrs. Kervatt. You've put together two books that are really useful to the school!"
3,buy it cheaper,http://selective-mutism.com/purchase.htmlthe book plus the supplement guide for less then the cost here.hope this doesn't get deleted :)
3,Not sure why this video is titled 'Don't Give Up',"To be fair, I have only watched one of the 5 episodes on this video, but I didn't get anything in the message that provided a life-lesson related to not giving up, which is why I bought this video in the first place. I'm hoping the other episodes will have a bit more relevant material. But for what it is worth, my son 3.9 year old loves dragons so if for nothing other then entertainment purposes, this suffices just fine."
4,Fascinating Book,"I'm a huge fan of hacker and true crime stories, and although I'd certainly heard of Kevin Poulsen, had no idea his capers were as vast and varied until reading this book! It's obvious from the opening pages that Poulsen's understanding of how the telephone network operated was simply profound. Coupled with his imagination and penchant for adventure, this true story reads like anything but. And wait until you read how he handles being outed on ""America's Most Wanted""!Highly recommended. If you're looking for other great books on the topic, check out ""Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier"", and ""The Hacker Crackdown: Law And Disorder On The Electronic Frontier""."
4,An absorbing story...,"Jonathan Littman's The Watchman is well written and engaged me enough to read it in one sitting. I wanted for some time to learn more about Kevin Poulsen having heard about some of the exploits attributed to him. This story accomplishes that in a compelling way and manages to be pertinent years later. This is required reading for anyone wishing to know the darker side of the hacker sub-culture, about Kevin Poulsen, Ron Austin or Justin Petersen and some of their creative mischief and crimes."
4,The Ultimate Hacker Story!,"Kevin Poulsen typifies the avid computer thrill seeker! He was a very resourceful and ingenious individual who loved to get into computer systems for the challenge. The book goes into explicit detail as to how Poulsen gets into various systems. Many times he uses social enginering and ""dumpster diving.""He gets himself into trouble by feeling he does everything for the good of companies and the government. In some cases it is true and he exposes security weaknesses that are then corrected. However, he does not know where to draw the line and starts listening in on FBI wire taps and running escort services.In some cases the author takes liberty to assume that the reader understands specifics about the phone company and certain technologies and the book in those instances is hard to understand. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Hmmm... Perhaps Jonathan should have done more research.,"I think Littman is a good writer, however, the story is a bit one-sided. I think if perhaps a bit more research was done he would have have done Kevin quite a bit more justice, and the ""hacker"" community as a whole. I do not think the book gave Kevin a fair chance, and in a lot of ways made him out to be a monster. This, I highly doubt is the case. A good note in Jonathans court is the book is well written and flows fairly well. It is the complete lack of responibility that runs rampant in the media now. Perhaps, he (Littman) should have acted more responsible and presented a more documented tale of Mr. Poulsen. Direct conversations with Kevin, the investigators and Law Enforcement, as well as the other individuals involved would have made the book more enjoyable."
1,An unfocussed confusing read,"In The Watchman's concluding 'Author's Note', Littman, underlines that his book is a journalistic work This is an amusing comment considering his gross speculation and character judgments.While hardly a journalistic endeavor, The Watchman is not a work of fiction either. And this is what makes it so confusing to read. Littman's intentional blurring of fact and fiction was intended to produce a readable piece. But what is the result? By what standard is to be judged?As work of fact, the book lacks references, instead relying on its subject's anecdotal incident accounts.As a work of fiction it misses the mark: the characters are largely explored superficially, and their many exploits described too rapidly, too vaguely. So, what is left? Tabloid. Worthless tabloid"
2,"This book had potential, but ended up being ""fluff.""","This book had some good potential, but the author instead decide to write a tabloid story. Any technical details that made it into the final edit seem to be there purely by accident. Cliff Stoll proved in ""The Cuckoo's Egg"" that you can write a good, technically accurate, ""fun"" story. If someone unfamiliar with Poulson's reputation were to read this book, they would think he was a burgler, not a hacker.There also doesn't seem to be any description of Poulson's personality or drive, other than a vaguely described ""Hacker Ethic"".Don't bother with this book if you are looking for anything similar ""The Cuckoo's Egg"" or ""Takedown"".On a positive note: This book flows smoothly along, making a quick read that doesn't require too much concentration."
2,Big Letdown,"Tough read--! This book, while informative, is very slow reading and not at all like the Fugitive Game. I should've been clued in when I read the back cover and instead of a real synopsis, I get to read two reviews of ""The Watchman"" and THREE REVIEWS of ""The Fugitive Game!"" It's pretty sad when you buy a book and there are more reviews for another book than the one you're purchasing. The dialogue of this book is good enough, but Litman bores us with too much in-depth technical information on phone switches and the internal setups of California telco buildings. I think more insight into Poulsen's personal life would've made this book a much better read."
4,sure to become a collectors item,"I am a pretty good friend of Kevin. I can assure youhe is no longer in federal prison and is now once again loose on thestreets of LA. I know there are lots of great storiesto tell about his experiences and I'm sure Littmanwill be great at making things sound more exciting andless true than they are. With regard to the title it shouldbe noted that people are born Hackers, thus the term""serial hacker"" is quite redundant. Don't miss the littlepicture of Littman at the bottom of the front cover."
5,Great Way to Introduce Children to Spanish.,"This uniquely illustrated children's picture book, ages 4-10, includes a Spanish/English vocabulary list with a scattering of Spanish words printed in red throughout the story. A popular subject in the media of late: when best to introduce children to new languages? Recent studies have proven that young kids are more receptive to the fun of learning new languages and, as a result, appreciate other cultures. They make new friends.This book tells of a special friendship between a small dog named Princesa and her kitten friend, Friskie. Here, Princesa risks her own life to save Friskie."
1,terribly ugly,"I'm sure this will be an interesting read, but the packaging is really terrible. It has been OCR'd from an older edition and typeset in some inappropriate sans serif font, with tables and figures in low-resolution scanned versions. I might just throw this one away and get a prettier version because this is just too annoying."
2,Needs some set up work done,"The book in itself is agreat historical reference but the kindle version has 2 major drawbacks.1-. All graphics are of a really low quality and some are even ineligible as the ""tint"" is much lighter than the one used for the font.2-. all text in italics are not properly formatted. The words are all jointed together and without spacing making them all hard to read.I can not recommend this book until these issues are solved."
4,"Good, could be better","I just bought this ice crusher a few weeks ago and so far I am reasonably satisfied. It is attractive to the eye, reasonably sturdy in its construction, does a good job actually crushing the ice and is easy to clean.Drawbacks are that is is extremely light and as other reviewers have mentioned, you really have to hold on to the top of it with one hand while you are turning the crank with the other. Otherwise you are going to see the crushed ice you have just worked so hard to produce go flying across the kitchen. In fact, I've been resting the bottom of the crusher on a folded up kitchen towel when I crank it to give it some traction on the counter. It's not a problem if you are careful, just be warned."
1,Handle came out,The very first time I used it the handle came out dumping all the teeth of the grinder and everything else into my ice. I returned it and have received a new one but I'm afraid this one will fall apart too.
3,It is ok,"If you like the thrill of receiving chrome in the mail this is a big plus. The Ice maker works although it does not grind the ice as small as I would like for real smooth types of icy drinks. As for having two different direction to get two different sizes of ice, I didn't seem to notice any difference. As for the quality it does seem pretty well constructed and durable. I wish I had ordered the electric one. But this one will do for now."
2,Nice at first...,"Bought the non-chrome version of this about 1 year ago. Worked great. After about 2 months of use, the innards fell apart. No big deal, just tighten the screw again. However, the metal blades are now rusting, the steel post is now rusting, and the outer spacer is now rusting. Stainless steel is not that much more expensive than chromed steel."
4,Watch your knuckles,"""Some say the world will end in fire; some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction ice is great and would suffice."" Robert Frost was not talking about ice crushers, but he could have been when he said the ""for destruction ice is great and would suffice."" The Metrokane does a good job crumbling ice to pea to almond-sized shards, but keep the end nut tightened or you'll wind up with a mess of blades in your drink. (The wise will make a note of the order and orientation of the blades and spacers before they fall out the first time. The even wiser will take a good digital close-up."" Also watch your knuckles when furiously turning the handle. For destruction, ice is great and will suffice."
3,Looks cool but may not work for everyone,"In order to make our favorite drinks, Mai Tais, we thought we had to have a proper ice crusher. I bought this one (chome steel upper & plastic chrome base) and it worked pretty well if you had the strength to operate it. Unfortunately, I found I didn't have the strength (except in one position) nor did I have the patience. In order to use this device without it tipping over while I was cranking, I found I had to get on the floor, hold the base between my knees to anchor it & then crank away. This I imagine may be too much trouble for some people. I found it to be a plain chore myself. If you prefer the vintage look, then this is the one to go with but if you prefer easy quick crushed ice, then go with the Rival electric ice crusher like I ultimately did. My friend of mine was happy however, that he received the vintage looking chrome ice crusher as a hand-me-down & at least someone is getting some use from it."
4,Great for the price.,"This manual crusher uses blades going through large slots which would appear to have a longer usefull life as blades would not get dull, as in a blender. Top holds about two cups of ice and bottom holds about 6 - 8 cups of crushed ice. Bottom is plastic, but I have seen no sign of chipping as previously reported. Not being electric makes it very portable and I find little effort is needed to turn crank. The crushed ice works great in shakers and blenders, and is infinitely better than the one built into my refrigerator. At the current discount price this is absolutely great for a 2 - 4 cups of crushed ice a night and where a plug for an electric model might be in a hard to get place. If you throw parties or have higher needs for crushed ice, and electric model might be the way to go."
2,Looks great but that's about it,"I received one of these for Christmas 2001 (all chrome model.) Looks great/retro next to my chrome coffee grinder & retro chrome blender. Drawbacks...bottom cup that catches the ice looks like chrome. It is plastic. Can't wait till cold ice cracks this baby. Also, after using it about once a week for five weeks now, last night all the cutter blades fell off into the ice catcher while I was turning the handle. Now I am trying to contact the company for a drawing of how to put this back together because I'm not gonna pay freight to ship it to them, and include $5 for them to ship it back to me! Overall recommendation...looks great on the counter but don't use it very often!"
4,It looks classy and it works.,"This is just an ice crusher. I love the retro feel and it works well with my Hamilton-Beach old-fashioned mixer, but in all honesty this is just an ice crusher. It serves its purpose well and it is easy to clean. The bottom is plastic and the top is a menacing futuristic chrome. If you are wanting to buy this because you need an ice crusher, you can probably find a much cheaper one; but if you are wanting to buy this because you like the '50s diner type look, then look no further. It does exactly what it needs to and nothing more."
4,remote contrsl,Very good price. Words well except for the time recording mode on my older model Zenith TV/VCR combo
1,This Earpiece does not work!!!,"It makes static noises when you talk, and you can barely hear the person you are talking too. This earpiece is a waste of money no matter how cheap it is!!!!!"
1,Was not a new battery,"Bought his for my housemate as she needed a new battery, the battery was worse than her old one and had scuffed contacts when it arrived. Was a used battery."
5,unique talent,"ML Richards has many moods and shares each with us over the course of this CD, or at least the songs listed here...very smart take on each of her songs. Dandelion is so believably hers that one forgets for a second that is a tribute to perhaps the finest of bands, the Rolling Stones. This CD is a very emotional experience."
1,Nothing new.,"What can you say about a book that doesn't even manage to get Bon Scott's date of birth right? Seemingly cobbled together from fansites, old interviews and bits lifted from Clinton Walker's far superior tome on Bon Scott, this offered no fresh insight into the band or their history. The narrative was confusing and choppy and looked like a patchwork of third hand information. A long, rambling and inconclusive chapter about Bon's death did nothing to raise the stakes. The definative AC/DC book is out there somewhere, but this ain't it."
3,AC/DC will always rock,AC/DC will always rock and this book explains why. They got the story right. The detail as to the early stages of the band is what I enjoyed above all else. The historic turning over of the reigns from Dave Evans to Bon Scott. I doubt there's ever been a single more important move in rock history as far as frontment go. Bon went from driving the band to gigs to literally driving the band to superstardom. It's tragic he passed at such a young age (33) and on the brink of worldwide domination. Brian took over and has done a fine job keeping the AC/DC juggernaut going strong but there will never be another one like Bon. All versions of the band are well covered and you have a discography plus more. If you're a fan of AC/DC you can't be without this book.
2,Nothing new...,"This is just another rock ""biography"" that is nothing more than footage taken together from magazines and other books. Of course, there are no interviews with key member of AC/DC given specifically to this book (the Young brothers just don't permit it). All in all, there is absolutely nothing new here. I suggest you to read ""Highway To Hell""."
3,Not The Best,"There are much more detailed, more thoroughly researched books on AC/DC. This book can't come close toAC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll: The Ultimate Story of the World's Greatest Rock-and-Roll Bandfor detail and accuracy. The majority fo information here can be found elsewhere, and the research seems a bit lazy at times. That being said, this is very readable, and is entertaining. The author does give what various people said who claimed to be with Bon his last night among the living, all of which need to be heard. Over all though, this seems like a condensed version of events, though that may appeal to readers with shorter attention spans. There's interesting bits of trivia thrown in at the end, though I'm sure you could find most of it on line in a matter of minutes. If you find this cheap or just want to read everything on AC/DC, then grab this. Otherwise, there's just much better biographies of the band in print."
1,Understanding the Older Horse : You Guide to Horse Health Ca,very disappointing. Targeted audience is apparently the first-time horse owner that bought an older horse. Too much time is spent with GENERAL good horsecare and not geriatric care. Very elementary level. I've gotten more information about caring for older horses w/in general horse care books.
3,C# OK but not for GUI development,"I am kind of disappointed that this book covers so little about Visual Studio.Net and developing C# software in Visual Studio. Apparently it is not for a beginner, however it is not good enough for a professional developer. It is hard to write a book to make both beginners and professionals happy. This is probably the one that tries to satisfy both although the editorial claims for professional."
5,Awesome book on C# and .Net,Very cool intro to .Net and very logical and interesting presentaion of C#. Great combo with Professional ASP.Net
3,Read only if you have lots of free time,"First of all in more than half of it the book covers the .net platform not just the C# language. This is not 1200 pages of C# language programming. Second, the book has alot of padding and fluff which makes the reading confusing and difficult to comprehend. The book could have been written in half the pages. However, it is the best survey of the material out there so far."
2,"Not reliable, too many errors","I generally have found the Wrox books pretty good, but after two weeks of using this book to help me with my first C#/.NET project, I am tempted to retire it. The quality is inconsistant (to many writers?) and I have found numerous typos and technical errors including code snippets that are incorrect and won't compile. For example, the section on Threads in Chapter 7 is poorly written, contains mistakes and leaves out important details like the fact that you can't directly use the lock() method to synchonrize a value type (which it implies you can).I bought this book after buying the O'Reilly book ""Programming C#"" with the hope that the Wrox book would fill in some gaps. However, the O'Reilly book, though it is light in a few areas, is much more consistant, readable and accurate. Its too bad, because a lot of the content in the Wrox book is good, but there are too many mistakes to make it a reliable source of information.This will probably be my last Wrox book."
2,Look elsewhere for a good C# book,"I bought this book to get up to speed on the C# language since my company is going the .NET route. I got it last week and have read the first 200 pages and I have to say that it is one of the worst written technical books I have ever seen as far as the grammar, typos and code examples - and I have a ton of technical books - being a developer for 8 years. There are typos everywhere - not just in the code samples but the actual wording in the book, some code examples work but alot of them don't - If you've been writing code for awhile you can stumble through them - but if you're a beginner or not real comfortable with OO design steer clear...I've always thought Wronx books were good and most are but this is definately an exception. I give it 2 stars because it gives you a decent overview of the language. You can eat the meat and spit out the bones but there has to be a better C# book out there."
2,"A thick, but not a well written book","Some of the most important concepts of C# (classes, inheritance, interfaces, Delegates and events) were not cleanly/clearly explained. Explanations were wordy and not easy to follow.Lots of typos, in fact, too many. This alone shold explain the quality of the book already.(...)"
4,Good Overview,This is a good book for someone who wants to get an overview of as many .net technologies as they can in one book. This book compares favorably to the Andrew Troelsen book (make sure you get the beta2 version). They are both very similar. It's clear that Wrox threw as many writers as they could at this project to get the book out and there are errors but it is a good place to start. They don't go into too many details about any one technology but you can find tons of samples online once you learn the basics from this book.
2,Did any one grammer check this book?,"Holy Moly.. I simply can't believe how poorly written this book is. The first few chapters are readable, but the farther you read, the worse it gets. Here's a sentence that perhaps Yoda wrote on page 488 of Chapter 10 (3rd para) ""The answer is to that no."" That is also how I'd respond to ANYONE asking me whether or not to purchase this book. FYI: I dislike code examples that drag along for hundreds of pages (ie. Mortimer Phones). It is possible to come up with an example to demonstrate a principle and then start clean for the next topic."
5,SIMPLEMENTE EL TRI!,"Me parece que el concierto Sinfonico refleja la escencia misma del tri, arreglos muy bien logrados con toda la peculiaridad de su vocalista Alex Lora, excelente desicion para aquellos que no conocen al Tri, ó simplemente para los que somos aficionados a este grupo.-Este DVD no puede faltar en la colección de todos aquellos a quienes nos gusta la música del Tri.-"
3,El super Tri,"Es una excelente produccion que representa dignamente a los músicos mexicanos contemporaneos.Cada quiene tiene criterios diferentes, y en mi caso lo único que no me gustó es que'l Alex Lora se adornó como de costumbre con algunas majaderías y maldiciones, pero que le vamos a hacer!!?? es parte de su personalidad y a fin de cuentas el objetivo es disfrutar unas buenas rolas."
5,Great Book,This book tells in great details of how kids really feel about going to bed! It's a great book and set to bring your kids up around. They'll beg you to read it to them even when their older!
3,Has one problem,it works good but the adapter does not work because the formatting is different from that of the device it is made for. do hot buy if you want to use it as a memory stick pro
1,"Won't work, will not format",i am not sure why but it won't work at all i am thinking because it was sent from overseas maybe it is diffrent somehow.
3,Nice Quotes,"Stiel spent a great deal of time compiling these various thoughts and quotes about serving people. The infamous ""Service with a Smile,"" anyone?Like Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which is also about serving the needs of others, save Stiel is like the little old lady with the deader-than-roadkill saying.If you love quoting people on customer service, this is for you. If you don't, then don't."
3,Puts a smile on your face.,This is a cute little book that will help anyone who works in the hospitality industry get through the day.
3,Not what I expected,"This book was not what I expected. It's more a compilation of quotes and thoughts about serving the public. Still a nice read though. Small and thin, this book would make a great gift idea for friends and employees."
1,Dont waste your money,This is a mindless book with no substance. It is amazing how people can make money selling such meaningless nonesense. This material is not original...just a bunch of quotes. This is not at all helpful for customer service. Dont waste your money.
1,Excerpts from Church documents not in context.,Many of the excerpts from Church documents that this book used exclude material from the same paragraph that puts a much different light on the topic. The book doesn't come across as being very honest.
2,Dangerously Misleading,"While the articles in this book are well-written, the documentation given in the book on papal, council, and scriptural statements is dangerously misleading and inaccurate in some circumstances. The attempts to put the comments in their historical context does not always reflect the complete events or context. It is a good starting point for some thorough research, however, and I would strongly urge anyone who reads this to check out the authors' sources on their own. In general, it appears that the authors of the individual articles only cited examples that, if construed in a certain way, would support their argument. Dangerous and full of half- truths."
3,Interesting,"Echoing the concerns of the Princeton reviewer, I found this to be an interesting book if coupled with deep contextual reflection. If you are interested in such works, I should recommend Reese, INSIDE THE VATICAN, Stark, THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY and Gill, RENDERING UNTO CAESAR."
1,California has spoken,"This is a deceptive piece of work. Angry dissenters from Church doctrine attempt to show that the Church has reversed itself on key moral issues, but the methods used fall far below the minimum for theological scholarship. Texts are cited out of context, counter-texts are suppressed, tendentious interpretations are offered which would make the editors of The Wanderer blush.This is pure venom disguised as a theological argument.If you want the real story of what the Catholic Church teaches, read the Catechism of the Catholic Church. For a serious exploration of how Church doctrine evolves, dust off your Newman."
2,Sturdy but jerky for video,"Sorry, but this is not a good video tripod. It's strong and light and tall, but it is *not* a fluid head. Spend $200+ on a Manfrotto or equivalent fluid head and you'll get smooth pans. With this Smith Victor, you won't."
3,Smith Victor Pro Tripod Worth a Look for Video,"Very sturdy, great price. A bit disappointed that the head does not swivel from the standard horizontal shooting position to a vertical shoot position for a digital SLR. There is a clumsy work-around but would have been easier to just include that feature in the head. I get the impression this is more of a ""Video"" useage tripod because of the head. If the manufacturer means the ""2 way fluid head"" pans and tilts easily, I guess they're right. However, because of the head not being able to swivel to a vertical shoot, I'm not recommending this tripod to anyone who shoots stills."
4,"Realism and Fantasy in a hip, hip book","A very accomplished first novel which the author wrote while still at college. Four distinct narratives bound up with a murder in an area of New York full of racial, class, political and generation tense. Buy a copy wherever you can as it is out of print and will become a classic. watch this space. Nolan the Bookee"
4,The Stonewycke Legacy 1-3,"This Trilogy is the continuation of the generations of a Scottish family who although inherit a castle also inherit a kindred spirit in their pursuit of true peace and contentment with themselves and with their God. Despite difficult and desperate circumstances their resolve, strength and resilience, is inspiring and thought provoking, as they learn to rely and trust in God through all that they go through. How many times do we struggle on in our own stubborn ways and not heed that still small voice of the Holy Spirit who longs for us to listen and learn and lean on Him to find true fulfilment and strength to go on and make it through the toils and pains and joys that life presents us with."
5,Thank you for fast shipment!,"I really liked this balls, my wife as well. The biggest surprise for me was:1) Speed - i receive package in 2 days (what is understandable but still enjoyable)2) Ammount - i absolutely miss x2 when was ordering.Plus thank you for newspaper =)"
3,Great fun,"This is my first pair of baoding balls. I enjoy using them daily while reading, watching tv, taking a dump, literally any spare time. It installs a sense of calm relaxed focus in you. So overall these things are great, but the manufacturer sent me two different sized balls. Pretty F'ed up, I know. Im not sure if having two different sized balls matters, but I have gotten used to it and enjoy using hem all the time. I highly suggest buying a pair but consider buying form a differnt manufacturer since I did receive two different sizes. They are great fun and I plan on buying another set in the soon future."
3,You get what you pay for,"These were pretty much what I expected, and what was described, with one exception; the little box that they came in (pictured in the ad) looked slightly used, a little worn around the edges. It still opened and closed correctly so it isnt that big of a deal but definitely didn't looks brand new so if youre ordering these as a gift, be aware of this. I simply sanitized the balls and box and went on to enjoy them."
3,not bad,"They are just ""o.k."" for what they are, I guess. They are not quite as heavy or solid as what I expected."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed with the item, when I opened the package the outside of the box looked very old and torn in places. The threads were coming out and the red paper on the inside of the lid and on the bottom looked as though it was very badly glued."
3,great gift,Beautiful Item. Reasonable price. I keep them on my desk at work for stressful times. May order again as gifts.
4,Perfect for beginners or small hands,"They were a little smaller than I expected, but otherwise exactly what is described. Good size to do more than 2 balls in a hand at a time, or to practice techniques you can't do with larger ones, like spinning them palm down."
3,Half broken,"These feel wonderful and turning them is very relaxing, but one of them arrived broken and does not chime. When shaken it makes a rattling noise, and since there's no way to open the ball I have no way to fix it. A little bit irritating, but they were cheap and I now know that it would be worth it for me to invest in a higher quality set."
3,One Ball Doesn't Work,"I just received the balls today, and I'm very excited to use them; However, one of the two balls does not make a chime sound, but just rattles. They are the same size, and have the same feel, and they work, but like I said, one doesn't work. The blue container to store it is pretty cheep, but so was the price of $5. Due to the fact the seller was not Amazon, I can't receive replacements, and to return costs the same price as buying them... so there's no point in returning them. If you want to receive good quality balls, then buy more expensive ones and get it from a different dealer. 3 Because it works, and is what I ordered, but one out of the two balls doesn't ring which was part of the deal"
4,Relaxing and fun,"Bought these to see if they might help with my arthritis in a couple of my fingers. Minimal results on that, but does seem to feel a little better at times. I find myself going through a patter of setting these down for a few weeks, then using them daily for a couple weeks. The box looked like an old used box as well, but it holds the balls well and isn't a big deal. For the low price it was an excellent buy. Shipping was also fast."
3,Dusty and used on arrival,"This product is highly priced and the style selection is random. I am happy to have the product, but I was dissapoonted they were smaller than I thought was advertised and I was not aware the style an color you received was random until after I purchased. Overall they are nice and im happy i have them in spite of paying too much and having to clean them up on arrival. I was also lucky to get a style close to what I like."
5,Excellent for Burning off Nervous Energy,My sister had a pair of these and I have always wanted a pair. The price was right and these balls really fit the bill. They are rather large so if you have tiny hands these may not be the stress balls for you. They have an additional feature in that they will ding ever time the clack together letting you know when you swirling technique may need some extra work.Overall I would highly recommend this product.
5,Baoding Balls Chinese Health Exercise Stress Balls Chrome Color,Purchased this for my use. A big help for my rehabilitation after my lung transplant. Has made a pleasant impact on what I was looking for in my recovery.
2,"scotland, A Concise History","This is a quite readable work of political history for a general public and with a highland focus. A short book with lots of nice pictures, little analysis, no context provided for the political history, and no footnotes. Concentrates on fifteenth to seventeenth centuries."
4,Real Soul Systas,"Terri & Monica give you a nice blend of R&B melodies to solid hip hop grooves. Singing background for Mary J. Blige, Heavy D, & Al B. Sure and writing songs for Soul For Real and Total are only some of the many contributions that they gave to the new jack era. On this debut album, they wrote and co-produced all the tracks. Stand out cuts include ""I've Been Waiting"" (from the movie ""Poetic Justice), ""Intentions"", and the first single ""Uh Huh"". They also know how to slow it down on the Jazz tip with tracks like ""I Need Your Love"" and you can even hear the Motown sound in other slow jams like ""Where Are You Now."" R&B fans looking for good music will surely be satisfied with the purchase of this CD!!!"
3,Any Luck with Luv Me of Leave Me???,If anyone is still checking on this. I would like a copy of this album as well.
3,Gyrlz cd,"If you're still looking for the Gyrlz ""Love Me or Leave Me"" cd, it is out of print but I do have the original lp in mint condition , plus the original CD which I also have a copy of along with great jpg images of the cd cover graphics.I also used to have a video of the Gyrlz Love Me or Leave Me song which was introduced by Al B Sure but I ended up losing it.Gyrlz - Love Me or Leave Me cd 19881.If It's Games You're Playing2.Do You Want Me3.Wishing You Were Here4.Jam Jam (If You Can)5.Think You Know Me6.

5,We want the Gyrlz!,"I am also trying to find The Gyrlz- Love me or Love me on CD. I have it on tape, but I'd love it on CD. Maybe if enough of us stress our demand for this item, we'll get it"
2,From Back Cover,"In 10 years with the FBI, Damien Perry had posed as a drug lord, a terrorist, even a hit man. Now the thrill was gone. But what would he do if he quit? Maybe the answer was in the mail, on the card from Marian Olivia Jensen - Molly, as he remembered her. The earthy redhead who aroused unfamiliar fantasies of a wife and family in his jaded soul.Molly Jensen was finally safe from her menacing ex-husband - until he was released from jail. Now the threatening phone calls wouldn't stop. Molly knew there was only one man who could help her: Damien Perry. His charade as her live-in lover was ingenious, but how long could she pretend to be pretending?"
1,sore hands and metal shavings,"This juicer might be for you if you only plan on squeezing a small amount of fruit. However, trying to get enough limes pressed for a pitcher of margaritas proved to be too much. Not only were my hands sore, but the cheap gears left metal shavings in the juice.I plan on returning it and stepping up to a real juicer."
4,Not true love at all,"I found this book to be very well worth reading, everything is supported by factual evidence(e.g the letters and police reports)and Simmie keeps the story progressing very well from start to finish while keeping it clear and understandable for the reader to follow what is happening. It doesn't tell the story of a man consumed by love as most would say, but of a man consumed with himself and his selfishness, he wanted something and didn't care what or who he destroyed in the process of acheiving it."
2,Cute but fragile,"I bought three of these: one worked fine, the second was over-wound and ruined within five seconds, and the third slipped from my child's hand and exploded into all its component parts when it hit the floor. While user error or carelessness are clearly to blame for these incidents, I frankly would like a little more durability in an item designed for kids. It's cute and clever, but purchase at your own peril."
2,Cute Toy - Lousy Pencil Sharpener,What we have here is a good idea but a poorly made product. You get a little robot that looks like it was made in the 1950's (but plastic not metal) and it walks once it is wound up. You can wind it with your pencil or with the key that comes with it and then it will walk a few inches (or slip in place on a smooth surface). The pencil sharpening part is the same single blade sharpener your get at a five and dime store. It works but not well. When you wind the robot using the pencil it sounds like you are over-winding but if you stop turning the pencil it won't be sharp. I picked this up for my son and he has decided to use it as a robot and forget about the pencil sharpener.Not recommended.
3,Walking Robot Sharpener,It is cute but I didn't realize it was so small. Will us it as a stocking stuffer. I am sure he will like it..
3,"Cute, But too tight","I like the sharpener, it's really cute, but it holds pencils so tightly that it tends to break the point and pull the lead outso its very difficult to actually use as a sharpener.It is durable, the dogs play with it and it still hasn't broken.The sharpener opening is just too tight, at least for a No. 2 / HB pencil."
2,"A Good Start, but Incomplete","The book says that this book is for Beginner to Intermediate"". I know some about J2EE, mostly Apache, but very little about WebLogic.I found that lack of knowledge frustrating in getting some of the examples to run correctly. They may work correctly, but it was beyond my capabilities to get them to run.An introductory chapter on WebLogic Server would have been very helpful. If you don't know WLS, you may want to get a book on that before tackling Workshop with this book.I wouldn't go so far as to say ""Don't Buy This Book"", but just understand what it is and what it isn't."
5,Perfect!,"I got this collar for my 4 month old dachshund puppy. It was a little big on her but this is no fault of the manufacturer. I ordered it that way on purpose as she still has some growing to do and I didn't want to have to get another collar in a few months. I fixed this issue by adding another hole in the collar with a heated ice pick so it fits her perfectly now. The collar is very good quality, with well made double-ply nylon so it won't fray. It has smooth seams so there's nothing to rub up against sensitive skin. The buckle has smooth, rounded edges as well as a thick, secure pin so it won't come apart if your dog pulls hard. Very happy with the purchase."
2,Rambling and incoherant,"It doesn't matter how good at something someone is, if they don't write well a book by them will be substandard. This is the case here. The book is rambling and incoherant, and by the end i was more confused than enlightened regarding Gin strategy. It's written more like a biography than a book on game strategy and it's not a particularly interesting biography anyway. Don't buy this book. Get Sam Fry's instead: it is less than half the size but teaches you more than twice as much about Gin Rummy!"
3,"Good Tips for Partnership Gin,","The author provides good tips for partnership gin. However, his analysis of regular gin is best suited for beginners only. There are better books for singles players."
2,OVERrated and has drawbacks,This Sangean H2O radio looks and feels like quality. The rubber buttons don't wear well. The AM reception is bad. You have to drill into the wall if you want to attach it in your shower/bath. I had to screw it in on the wall next to the shower.
3,shower radio,This shower radio seemed to do just about everything that I thought it would. Just a word on the batteries; it says it uses three C cells and it actually uses four D cells. Don't buy the batteries until you see the radio. I bought it because we like to have a radio on our small catamaran.
2,Broke easily,"I've had this over a year, but it is already broken. I went to flip open the battery door on the back and the hinge piece broke. The battery door can no longer close, which no longer makes it ideal for the shower, and it would also be awkward to hang this thing on my shower curtain rod with the back open. The hinge piece is too small to glue back on. When I moved into my sister's basement to help her out, I also struggled to get my radio stations to come through."
4,An expensive but quality shower radio,"The sound and tuning ability of this shower radio is what makes it worth the money. The unit is solid and I feel it will last a long time. The tuning is digital which makes sure you ""zero"" in on your intended station. Reception is good also."
3,D-Size Batteries!,This radio was larger and heavier than I had hoped and most of that is due to the larger D-Size batteries. Really wanted AA batteries. Sound is on the Bass side of things.
5,Best Shower Radio I've Ever Had,"The reception is great. It can pick up distant FM stations from 90 miles away that other radios in the house can't receive. The sound quality is decent, though it may lack adequate bass response for some groove-dependent listeners. Classical music and talk sound just fine, but if you like to get down to Parliament/Funkadelic as you're lathering in the morning, you may be underwhelmed. The batteries are rated for extended usage, and after a month of daily use, they're still going strong. I haven't found a need for the flashlight yet, though I'm sure this will come in handy during the next power outage."
2,A Clock OR a Radio - but not both!,"I wanted a device that would let me listen to music, show me the time, and beep after a specified period while taking a shower. This will only show the time if the radio is off. When you're listening to the radio, it only shows the station's frequency. Also, while not a deal-breaker, the timer is rather inconvenient: it defaults to 15 minutes, so if you want it to go off after 3 minutes in the shower, for example, you have to reduce the time by pushing a button 12 times, each and every time you use the timer."
1,Sagean H201 AM/FM,"Bought two of these radios within the last year, one is still operating. FM stopped working last month on one unit only get static on that band. Contacted the company and told that since warranted only for 90 days there are NO OTHER OPTIONS, we would have to buy a new one. We are, JUST NOT A SAGEAN."
5,Seems to be the best,"I have gone through a plethora of shower radios trying to find the ""one"" that does the job. This is the one, it works well, reception is great, sound is good, and the mounting system is top notch. A good buy."
3,Worked great for 60 days,"This is a great radio, with excellent reception,sound quality and features. However, mysteriously after two months of use, the FM stations just stopped working for no reason. The radio was never dropped or ?, so why the FM stations stopped working is a mystery. I returned the radio under the warranty and based on the lack of reliability,I am going to buy a different brand."
4,Great Radio,Great little radio for the shower. Meets all expectations. Hangs easily in the shower. The battery life seems good so far. I would recommend to anyone in need of this specialized piece of electronics.
5,Great radio that holds up well over time,"I've had this radio in my shower for well over a year now. I was skeptical that it would keep working but thought I'd give it a shot. What a surprise! It not only still works, it is still on the first set of batteries! I listen for about 30 minutes every morning and I have 25% left on the batteries.The sound is really good for a single speaker shower unit. It isn't a 7.2 home theater, but those aren't usually waterproof. So there you go.The radio reception is a bit skittish. Without an external antenna it doesn't get great reception except for the strongest stations (and I don't want to listen to Shakira five times per shower). I sometimes have to move it to a few places to get the best non-static reception. Otherwise I have not even the smallest concern about this unit."
4,Great Radio,I have purchased several Sangean radios all of which are great. This one is no exception. Good reception and sound.
5,excellent radio,"The sound is really great and the fit and finish is excellent. A very nice surprise to find such a great product. It even has good tone which is very hard to find in this day and age. Would buy again. My husband and I have had an electronics repair shop since 1973 and most new radios are not impressive but this one even impressed him, which is hard to do. I bought it to use in the shower and I hate to as it is so nice looking and sounding."
2,Lost sound after 10 months,"I loved this radio for the past 10 months, than suddenly I lost the sound. Everything else seems to be working but cannot hear the radio. Contacted customer service and they said that they could fix it but that I would have to send it out to California and pay $8.00. They said it would take 4 to 5 weeks before they would send it back.I am going back to a Sony since my last one lasted 6 years before it stopped working."
5,excellent,"The radio has been great. The reception, sound quality, and volume are all good. The wall mount is solid and it is easy to take the radio on and off the wall (we took it with us to the basement during a recent tornado warning!). The controls on the radio are intuitive. Overall, worth the cost for this shower radio."
5,Another GREAT Sangean Radio,"WOW what a radio!!I have had a Sangean table top radio in my kitchen for a few years now. After disappointment with Tivoli and Sony, the radio with the funny name turned out to be nothing short of fantastic.I asked for and received this shower radio for Christmas to replace a old Sony. Well, Sangean has done it again with a solid, well designed radio. Very impressive sound and a VERY sold feel.Thanks Sangean for producing such nice radio.12/27/09. UPDATE one year later. What a great radio. Unbelievably, no BS, it is still running on the same batteries I installed a year ago. Love this radio.10/13/11. Another update. I don't usually do this but this radio is just so damn good I had to follow up. To date, flawless operation. Still on it's second set of batteries! This thing JUST WORKS..........beautifully!"
5,Better than expected,I was amazed at the quality and sound from this radio. Installation in my tile shower was easy. I pre-drilled two holes and used the hardware supplied. Be careful about the water pipe location in your wall. It looks great and sounds extremely good. The radio picked up all the stations without any problems. Now I listen to the radio every day in the shower.
5,best shower radio EVER!!!,"Digital tuner with presets, great reception, insane battery life, water proof, can get really loud if you want. Can't recommend enough!"
5,Sangean waterproof radio,"Product met expectations,have used on several occasions as this was a X-mas gift,nice sound and appears to be water proof. Ordering and delivery was great !"
5,Great shower radio,"Like most of the other reviews, I am very pleased with my shower radio! I have had it for about 5 months with no problems. It gets great reception and very good volume. After 5 months, the battery indicator still shows 100% battery power!!"
5,Sangean H201 AM/FM Digital Shower Radio,"The Sangean H201 AM/FM digital shower radio is excellent. The sound and reception are wonderful. I would recommend anyone thinking of purchasing a shower radio, to explore the Sangean shower radio."
5,You can't get a better value!,"I bought one of these in January,2008. I've loved it! It's survived falls, moisture, and dead batteries. I'm now buying a second one, as my POS little Sony portable croaked. With the now considerably lower price, how can I say no?Try one, you'll like it!BTW, the battery life really is excellent, it uses two ""D"" cells and they kinda' last forever."
4,Shower radio,The radio sounds great. The look is modern and simple. Does not drain the battery at all. Good buy for sure.Was also shipped extremely fast.
5,Great sound quality,"I keep this on the side of my shower, so I will admit it has not gotten splashed much with water, but it seems to hold up well to the humidity.The sound is really impressive, loud and audible.Pretty easy to set up as well."
2,Good design. Poor quality.,"This radio malfunctioned after about a year. Pressing the + to increase the volume does not increase the volume; it changes the station and the band!! The problem occurs more and more frequently as time goes on. So, just when there is something I really, really want to hear, so I try to turn up the volume, the radio changes the station and I entirely miss what I especially wanted to hear!!I also have a Sangean pocket radio with ear buds that malfunctioned way too soon (there is no audio on the right stereo side). Then the ear buds started delivering static in both ears.Sangean products are well designed, so they make a good first impression, but they are poorly engineered and/or poorly manufactured.I will replace these radios with different brands."
3,It's a really huge radio item,"I was shocked about it's size on reveiving it - it's really huge. And it's very strange, because it's just the radio, without any additional features. Sound quality is not as good as I expected."
5,Like a portable Proton radio,"I just received the H210 and immediately it reminded me in terms of performance and build quality of the now defunct Proton 320 clock radio. The industrial engineering is really nice. The curved handle that rotates up from the back of the radio was a nice design feature. The display is large, and the sound quality is excellent. I noticed to my surprise that the AM reception ability was very good, and of course on FM it performed well. I liked that the radio has a two D-cell power source since I'm not that into rechargables, especially in emergency situations. The radio has a DC power input jack, but I didn't see such an accessory power module for sale from Sangean, so Radio Shack is the place I guess for an external DC supply. I'd give Sangean an A+ on the H210."
5,Excellent Radio- especially for the shower,"The waterproofing is great on this. This radio replaced a sharper image shower radio that was water resistant but constantly had to be ""dried out"" The battery life on this is Amazzzing. Reception is clear, speaker is capable for its purpose and can be turned up very loud w/o distortion. Definitely worth the couple extra dollars to buy one that just works!"
4,quality,has everything i was looking for except ear bud jack hole. good reception. backlight is a great feature for low light conditions. performs well.
4,great product,"I was using a sony shower radio for years and this one is much better.better reception , station preselection etcI miss an integrted clock and the product is a bit too heavy. The torch is useless but In all it's worth the money for those like me, that love to sing in the buthroom.....If you need a shower radio it's worth buying"
4,great radio for the shower or outdoors,We got one for the shower and another for outdoors - very clear with great reception.
4,Substantial in heft and price,"A solid, decent waterproof unit, though pricey in today's competitive high-tech market for a simple radio"
3,Too heavy,"Seemed like a good product but it required being screwed into the wall, which I was unwilling to do. It was heavy to start with and took 2 D batteries."
3,It's okay...,"I am enjoying my radio, however, it receives only 5 stations clearly -- and sometimes not so clearly. I am in the mountains, so I suggest that you take that into account. It would quite possibly be much better in flat lands."
5,Excellent!,"This is the best battery operated radio I've owned ever. Like others, I've found that it pulls in just about every station I want and the sound quality is great. It comes with both a mounting plate for putting it on the wall, and a strap to hang it, so you can really put it anywhere you want. Saves precious bathroom shelf space! The battery life seems very good too--I've used it daily for a few months and the battery indicator light says the batteries are still at full strength. In the post-holiday period, the price has gone down, and I just bought one of these for my husband for Valentine's Day. How nice to find such a high-quality product!"
2,Sound & Reception Quality Issues,"I had high expectations based on the reviews, but the sound quality is poor because there is too much base for a bathroom setting and no control. You get a booming sound and clarity is lost. I also do not believe the reception is very good either and that reduces your choices of positioning."
5,Exceeded all my expectations,"My wife originally couldn't believe I spent over $50 on a shower radio, but after having it a few weeks she changed her tune (no pun intended). Really solid product, I couldn't be happier with it."
4,Best shower radio yet,"I'm now on my second radio, the first one quit picking up stations after less than one week of use but with the great customer service of Amazon I had a replacement radio within three days and haven't had any problems since. The radio sounds great, is very easy to use, has the best reception of any shower radio I have used.Other strengths are it is easy on batteries and is also water proof, which has been tested........ The only reason I haven't given it five stars is I haven't had it long enough to test it's longevity as the first one broke quickly."
4,Good radio for bath,Sound quality is ok. Good enough for what it is designed for. Works great in bathroom. Easily mounts on wall bracket and is easily removed to use in other areas or take with you on a trip. Batteries last a long time.
5,I've had this radio for two years!,"Love this radio! We've had it for two years and except for the times we've taken it to the beach and such, it has hung in our shower the entire time. We've never had a problem with it and the reception has always been awesome for us. So glad we found it!"
5,Best all around radio,"Both my husband and I purchased this radio two weeks ago. We use it in the shower, all over the house, and take it on trips. Good sound quality, pulls in stations clearly, well-designed, sturdy, and very nice-looking. As you can see, it gets a lot of use and we still have 3 battery bars. Highly recommended!"
2,average,"Hope for strong sound and clear stations. Got average sound and weak stations. This brand used to be quality, and is now average. Don't pay extra for Sangean, if this is cheap its ok. Wished I had bought differently."
2,Don't expect this radio to last very long,"This was the perfect radio for our family. Great reception. However, a year and a week after purchase, it no longer works at all (just buzzes). For the amount of money I paid for this, I wanted it to last longer than a year. I don't want to buy a new one each year & will not buy this type again."
4,This radio works well,"It's hard to find shower radios in the stores these days. I guess everyone's listening to their iPods in the shower. This radio works well: It gets good reception, is plenty loud enough, and has large, easy to use buttons. Downsides: 1) It would be nice if it had more preset buttons; 2) C'mon people, $70 for a RADIO? I can't figure out what it does that makes it so expensive. For that kind of money I want something extra, like a built-in Pez dispenser. Something."
4,Bigger than I thought,"The one thing I wasn't expecting was for the radio to be so big! I guess I didn't pay attention to the fact that the specs say it's 12 x 9 inches. I considered returning it, but it involved sucking up shipping charges both ways and a 20% restocking fee. But now that I have it I do have to agree with the other reviews that the sound quality is great."
1,Awful,"Big, clunky and underpowered. Must have a very weak amplifier. Radios a fraction of the size offer much more volume."
1,I don't know,I recieved a broken radio and the customer service rep was very rude when I called for a return shipping label at electronic expo.
1,If you can't read very small print don't buy this.,This is a scan of an original but most of each page is white space. The text occupies about a quarter of each page. I can't comment on the content since I can't read the book. Look for another addition.
4,Moulds to Needs,"My home office is set up with these all around as these match very well with the straight-clean looks. I have these serving both as shelves and bins as these fit pretty much every need and keep the look consistent. The size fits all types of books, magazines, and three ring binders so you can shelve everything. The top shelves work very well for display - vases, die-cast models, pictures, you name it."
3,Very Blah for a non-christian couple,"We went through the book as a couple and had to bypass a good portion of the book due to alot of religious references that did not apply to us.The book covers a good range of topics (finances, sex, decision-making, family, etc) a good starting point to stimulate some conversation and discussion.But I was expecting more substantial questionnaires, surveys, and better questions."
1,Horrible,Did not say anything on the cover about it being a complete Christian point of view! What a waste of time for me.
1,Helpful only for the very religious,"Religion is a sticking point and source of tension for many couples, but if it's not, or if you are not Christian, this book will disappoint. Chock full of bible verses. Questions such as ""Which Sunday School teacher influenced you the most?"" and ""Are there any limits placed upon the wife's submission by Colossians 3:18 and Acts 5:29?"" simply do not apply to everyone."
5,Best thing for new couples,It was recommended to us and we have this along with the devotional and we are doig both together it has been great. Recommend it for other couples along with the devotional.
1,waste of time,"Had to complete this workbook per our Pastor's request and I found it to be a complete, mind numbing waste of time. I have nothing against the Christian aspect, just the general layout and all the, what I thought, ridiculous questions. Maybe my now husband and I are just that mature/practical in our thinking - because most of the categories this book covered were things that we had already discussed/figured out ourselves. The only way I feel this workbook would help is if you knew almost nothing about your partner/never communicated properly with your partner. It was so redundant and a frustrating waste of time in my opinion."
3,Average on the whole,"In some ways this book is a bit dated. The examples aren't always relevant, and the pictures are humorous to say the least. However, the selection of scripture and the insight from the authors work well when paired with a live premarital counselor."
5,AWESOME!,"Our pastor told us to purchase this book before getting married and this book is amazing. It does ask some pretty deep questions that will need your time and honest effort to answer. If your goal is to build your marriage on great foundation with God being the center of it, this is the book to get started with. It brought me and my future husband closer, opened our eyes to so much and just made us fall in love all over again."
4,premarital truths,"It""s a great book...but remember...only if you mean what you say and only if you answer in truth, and only if you mean to stick with what you say. EAsy it is to answer the way you suppose you should, then drop it all after the ""I do"" has become an ""I did"""
2,Not great,"I'm a pretty big EoDM fan, and this DVD...wasn't that great. It's like they wanted to make a documentary, then one of them found out he knows a high school student that can do 3d animation and had him pull some half-baked 3d models out of his ass and animate them and make it almost like a sitcom or something. They should of just stuck with documentary."
4,What I'd expect from EoDM,"They're silly and amusing. The ""special effects"" are a bit odd and ""different"", but not surprising for these guys!I do wish there were more songs, though, since I LOVE their music!If you're a fan, then you pro'lly already have this. But if you don't, it a must for your EoDM collection!"
3,Good ... and old,"This is a good dictionary but it's about 7 years old. I thought I was getting a newer version than the one I had. It said on the cover ""recently revised"". Old cover.That said, it's a good dictionary at a reasonable price."
3,Note: This covers Northern New Hampshire only!,"When I purchased this book, I figured that all of New Hampshire falls into the shadows of the White Mountains at one time or another; however, this book deals solely with North Country areas. If you're hoping or legends about North Conway, or Portsmouth, or Hanover, you're out of luck.Now, don't get me wrong - I'm not faulting this book for my incorrectly reading the summary. I'm a big fan of folklore no matter what the locale, and the collection of stories are good. But in comparison, Joseph Citro, in my opinion, is the best New England folklorist out there, and I think what makes Citro special is his ability to make local legends fascinating to those who live afar. Whereas Tales Told felt like I'd be much more intrigued if I actually knew the area, but having traveled very little into North Country, wasn't really brought into the legends.Sort of a mixed bag overall, but definitely of interest if you're heading up North."
5,A forgotten horror gem,"A truly frightening film. Babysitter (Susan George) is hired to take care of kid, while couple goes to dinner. But that couple has a skeleton in its closet in the form of the woman's ex-husband who once tried to kill her. He's sent away to a psychiatric hospital, but escapes and decides to get even with wife who put him there.Film contains truly scary sequences and is a hundred times better than the generic ""babysitter in peril"" that appeared during the late 70's-early 80's. Acting is superb throughout, and Ian Brennan as the psychotic ex-husband is truly brillant. Film is a must see for horror fans."
4,ANOTHER FIRST-RATE BRITISH CHILLER!,"Pretty blonde Amanda (Susan George) arrives at an isolated British manor to look after a young boy for the evening. It seems that the child's mother, Helen (Honor Blackman), is hiding a dark secret: She has a crazy ex-husband locked away in a nearby asylum. The secret is out when the psycho escapes and returns home for revenge. He terrorizes the babysitter while Helen and her new boyfriend are out on the town.One of the first babysitter-in-peril flicks, Peter Collinson's FRIGHT is also one of the best. George gamely takes on a role that requires her to maintain a state of terror while being assaulted by a non-stop bag of horrors. The results were so convincing that she played another victim later that year in Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS. Ian Bannen's performance is also a triumph. He actually makes you feel a great deal of sympathy for the male maniac."
5,Book Review,"This book is great. The Patsy character is my mother-in-law. She and all her brother and sisters are still living well in 2006. She resides in the south while her brother and sisters live in the northern region. She has 6 kids of her own and MANY grand childern. I have heard her tell her stories of living on the river, and it is great to be able to read about it in a story book as well. She talks about wanting to go down the river again someday and she just might."
5,I like it as much.....,I like it as much as the first one. I have watched it many times. The busty blond is still my favorite.
2,Read the fine print!,"Yes, the item in question is attractive and well-made. But ask yourself whether the units of measurement--3/4 oz. and 1-1/4 ozs.--are what you're likely to use. Since most standard drinks involve measurements of 1 oz., 1-1/2 ozs., or 2 ozs., I've found this isn't a very practical ""jigger."""
1,Not an useful size. Why purchase this?,"Most drinks recipes call for measurments in even sizes-- 1 oz, 2 oz, or 3 oz. This jigger is a 3/4 oz and 1 1/4 oz measurments-- which is not a useful size for cocktails. Please shop around for a 1 oz and 1 1/2 oz size jigger-- which is the standard jigger size. As a consumer I also recommend to shop around for the best price.Also if you like this jigger because of the stainless steel material, not to fret. Most jiggers are made with the same grade 18/10 or 18/9 stainless steel."
4,It does what it's supposed to do.,It is a good double jigger for going to those tailgate parties!! Solid.
3,Represent,"I am a fan of EDL or Every Day Life. Most of my time as been spent w their first two albums. I have recently added their 3rd and 4th CDs to my collection. While I generally enjoy the first two better, this forth album, Every Day Life does seem to offer a bit of redemption factor to the 3rd album, Moment Of Clarity. Where Moment Of Clarity brings a level of experimentation to a genre such as rapcore, Every Day Life brings the band's focus back to more of a hardcore/metal based rapcore. As usual, Tedd Cookerly's vocals are what keeps me coming back for more."
2,"This CD is not worth your money, time, or effort.","this CD stinks, simply because EDL simply does not know how to rock. They start screaming, and they scream, and they end screaming. literally. It made me want to scream in aggravance. This band simply does not know how to patch rock together, and these clowns that try to coordinate their music end up having their music bump into each other, guitars start screeching while the singer still hasn't finished making the 'important message between the lines'Not that I don't like Christian rock, but this band makes me laugh. Wait until they get better. But then again, a band this bad may always stay this way."
3,I got mine to work,"I received mine as a Christmas gift. The clock, inside temperature and humidity displays are fine. The remote sensors for the outside measurements worked when I set them up inside, but when I moved them outside, I lost the signal and could not get outside readings. I talked to the support people and they had me do a number of resets with fresh batteries, but it made no difference, so they sent me a replacement unit. The new unit had exactly the same problem - the remote sensors could only be about 10 feet from the base unit and transmitting through the outside wall just didn't work. I finally took the base unit apart and added a length of wire to the existing antenna. I made it 4 times longer than it had been. Since that little fix, the unit has worked perfectly."
1,"Nice looking, but it will break ...","Got one of these because I liked the way it looked, but after pressing some 300 limes (juicer is not practical for oranges anyway), the machine ""cracked"".The right ""foot"", the one on the side of the handle, could obviously not take the pressure and decided to give up (a crack on the inside where the body and foot come together). Although the machine is a bit out of balance now, I will continue to use it until the right foot really comes off.(Every time I squeeze a batch of limes, I see the foot gives up more and more)I still like the looks, but I would never buy one again..."
1,Poorly manufactered,I purchased this juicer but only got a couple dozen uses of it before the extremely cheaply produced gears broke. The gear is made using very low quality pot or zinc cast metal part which is not strong enough to resist the cast iron top.
2,"Cute, but only for very small fruits","This is the cutest juicer. I got one very similar to this for my wedding. The biggest problem is that you have to find very small oranges or it will end up wasting a lot of the fruit. The inverted cup upon which the orange is actually squeezed isn't as large as most oranges. You end up with a ""rim"" of unsqueezed orange and a lot of wasted fruit. I would stick with an electric juicer or, if you must have this juicer (and I admit, it's very neat), just buy the smallest oranges you can find."
1,Too Everything,"I've been looking for an old fashion, newly produced juicer for a long time. The ""Mighty OJ"" LOOKED PERFECT (yaay, I found one!), but doesn't really work. Getting a decent sized orange in is almost impossible because the handle doesn't lift the squeezing head up far enough off the basket dome. Even with small oranges or lemons there's too much unsqueezed pulp around the sides and a few seeds will hold the head too far off to get much of anything. So lots of wasted fruit.(Booooo)Very hard to get the dome out to clean.Nothing to lift it out with and the space, as said before is too small.This product is messy and inefficient.The retailer will give me my $$ back, no doubt. But I'm dissapointed with Metrokane. Did you guys try this thing? Or did you fall for the shiny chrome and elegant simplicity the product seemed to offer?(... the way I did). Most peoople won't return it (gas, time ) and you will have made the dollar. But your brand? Boooooooooo"
2,Disappointing juicer,"This juicer doesn't handle larger pieces of fruit at all well because the pressure-applying surfaces are too small. With a medium-size orange or even a large lemon it leaves a considerable amount of unsqueezed flesh around the edge, so I can't imagine using it with a grapefruit. It also requires a lot more downward force on the handle than I expected. Works great for those little Key limes, though."
2,Attractive on the counter but a worthless juicer,"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this. We purchased this because we wanted a non-electric appliance and opened it the day after Thanksgiving looking forward to fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Even with two people trying to squeeze - one pushing on the top and the other (a strong man, I might add) trying to pull the handle forward, it was impossible to budge. Perhaps this would squeeze a lime without a team of people. The only reason I rate this with two stars is because I love chrome appliances and it is pretty. Perhaps someone who receives it when I donate it to the Goodwill after only one use will enjoy using it to squeeze limes!"
1,Poorly made,"This looked like the one we had for 20 years, but it wasn't. As soon as we pressed a couple of limes, the part of the juicer that the lime sits on (both the cone-shaped piece and the piece that it sits in) are made of thin flimsy metal making it ineffective as a juicer. They bent the first time we used it. I am returning it and will not buy another one from this company."
4,great juice,performs better than I expected based on earlier reviews warning it may tip if not steadied by hand. Squeezes very well.
1,Old idea but lost functionability,I was using an old juice king while visiting relatives and it is a great juice squeezer. I thought this would be the same but although the design is identical the function is not. The Metrokane does not have much leverage for squeeze the juice out and large citrus barely fits. I went back to my hand squeezer. The nice thing about the juice king is that you do not get all the pulp. Don't waste your time and money. Lucky Amazon.com has a great return policy so I was able to return mine and credit my card. ai gave it a one star only becasue I had to give is something. The only redeeming is that it looks good.Metrokane Mighty OJ Home Juicer-Orange with Chrome Head and Handle
4,No problems,"I have had this juicer for a year now, and have not experienced any of the problems noted in the other reviews. We may use it 4 times a week for several weeks, or only on weekends for a month. It looks good, is sturdy, and is easy to clean. Place the orange or whatever in the holder, slowly press down on the paddle style handle, and its juice galore. For larger fruits or bigger oranges, lift the handle up, reposition the fruit carcass a little, one more squeeze and Bobs-your-uncle. We like the machine just fine."
2,Looks great! Works ... O.K.,"If you're looking for an orange juicer that will look great on your cabinet, then this might be the one. But if you're looking for a juicer that's user friendly and efficient, you might want to look somewhere else (like Metrokane's Chef's Juicer). When I bought the Mighty OJ, I noticed problems right off the bat. In the first place, it's hard to get an orange in this thing. There's barely enough clearance. So, if the orange is big, you have to sort of wedge it into the juicer. Then, the handle is short, so it's hard to get a good grip on it. If you don't hold down the left side of the juicer, it'll tip over when you press the lever down and spill juice everywhere. Also, with large oranges, this juicer won't remove all the juice. It will leave a ring of the juicy part of the orange just inside the peel. If you make orange juice once a week, these things might not bother you. If you make juice every day, they could be pretty annoying."
2,Don't buy it.,"I don't like gadgets, particularly electrical kitchen gadgets.Somehow the thought of using an electrical can opener rather than a mechanical one strikes me as idiotic. For that reason, I suffered with a Metrokane mechanical juicer for a long time. It was a pain to use, a pain to clean, was not very efficient, and shed little particles of aluminum. I then got a Braun MPZ22. The Braun is marvelous, much cheaper, more efficient and easier to clean; 15 seconds under a running faucet immediately after you have used it is all it needs.Buy the Braun instead!!"
4,Makes my Lemonade Sweet As Honey,"I bought this juicer, and I love it. It's great for everything from orange to grape fruit juice. The price is a little steep, but besides that its well worth it. I also have an electric OJ juicer and it can't compare. I'm sure you'll enjoy this product."
2,Review of Metrokane Mighty OJ Manual Juice Squeezer,"Although I ordered the juicer in the color black, I received the product in white. If not for the color I would have purchased it locally. After approximately 6 months of satisfactory occasional use the juicer is no longer functional. Some of the teeth on the gear that is connected to the press lever have broken off. I had expected a product this simple would have lasted for years. I am obviously totally disappointed."
2,Cone and funnel require TLC,"The cone and funnel parts are made of aluminum and will eventually discolor. I shouldn't have put them in the dishwasher, I know, but they turned black and began turning my lime juice gray. I pitched the whole machine."
2,Broke after 5 months,"First, this product did succeed in producing awesome tasting orange juice and made us lifelong converts to fresh-squeezed juice.But, it's sized so only small oranges are efficiently juiced. Larger ones cause the juicer cup to overflow, and a rim around the edge goes unsqueezed (wasted).Finally, despite the ""800 pounds of pressure"" claim, our gear mechanism broke after, say 200 oranges were squeezed. It's ironic, because the rest of the machine is bomb-proof heavy metal, but the gear wheel is some cheap-o alloy that split in half!We just purchased an OrangeX Express and hope for better luck."
1,Not a good buy,"This is really a quite awful and useless product. I used a restaurant-grade juicer for many years, and when it died, I went looking for another. I made the mistake of buying this product.It does not do a good job. I had been spoiled by the old juicer, just cut in half, place on the juicer and pull the handle (maybe push a second time). And done. With this product, you do that, and you have to repeat, over and over and over, and still you have not extracted the juice. There is no leverage, no clearance, not enough height between the top (the operative part) and the fruit. It is not hard to clean, just clunky and noisy and I know I am cleaning something that was just totally useless.I find myself squeezing juice by hand, every morning, rather than approach this thing. The reason: I get a lot more juice by hand than by using this critter. My dislike for this product borders on personal. :)Does anyone know where I might find an old restaurant/bar-type juice squeezer?"
2,This juicer stinks !!!,This thing does not extract nearly enough juice. It also cuts a hole in the rind and makes a big mess. It is unstable on the counter when you're pressing and topples over. Don't buy it !!
2,Orange Juice Lover,"Somewhat disappointing. It wastes too much juice and pulp and is not stable when pressing. Fortunately I am right-handed. Good only for occasional use on short runs of one or two, at most three, glasses, otherwise other squeezers are more appropriate. It works better with small oranges."
1,Worst purchase ever,Very poor job unless you will only use it for very small fruit like lemons and limes....it will just sit in my pantry unused!
1,Serious problems twice now,"I have now owned two of these juicers. Both have broken (the handle gets off-kilter and gradually disassembles itself; the head of the juicer cracks and eventually breaks from the stem). My first one lasted two years so I bought another when that broke. The second one is less than a year old; the head attachment is cracked and ready to break; the handle once again is gradually disintegrating. In addition, the second one is much more shoddy than the first; the 'cup' in the top does not fit cleanly into its seating. I will not buy a third and I strongly advise against purchasing this product."
1,works for lemons,"We received this as a gift just when our old electric one had bitten the dust. I was excited to have a durable product. But within a week my husband insisted that we replace this with another electric citrus juicer (we make oj every morning). Here are my pros and cons:Pro:Squeezes lemons just fine and requires less cleaning for a little bit of lemon juice than the electric one.Cons:Doesn't get out all the juice--we had to use 1.5 times the number of oranges as with the electric citrus juicer.Big oranges or grapefruits don't fit.Requires a lot of force--my hand and shoulder were extremely sore after I used this the first time.Not very stable, you have to be careful not to let it fall over.We kept it for the occasional lemon squeezing, since the store it is from is an hour and a half from us. But we bought an electric citrus juicer."
2,short life,"I purchased numerous elite 800 pumps.Most work great for awhile.Then most slowly lose power and than dont't work at all, no humming or air output.A few last but not many"
3,Needed this for the fish,The fish really loved this air pump. I never got to thank the 3/16 inch tube I ordered separate with the purchase.
2,Strings are nice,"Strings are ok, if you have a creative soloist that the strings are backing up, in thsi case we don't have acreative soloist, just a boring soloist. B-O-R-I-N-G. The strings sound sticky and too sugary sweet like cotton candy... yucky"
3,boston pops orchestra,"This could have been a great CD, but it isnt. All the music/songs are slow and draggy. If Arthur Fiedler had recorded it, I am sure it would have sounded great. Williams and Lockhart just have no originalty. The music sound is flat, Truly a masterpiece in how to take great music and destroy it"
1,Really Disappointing,I am really disappointed with this book. The examples in the book are rarely software examples. I would recommend reading articles off http://software.isixsigma.com
2,Don't judge a book by its cover,"While Sigma Six Software development is an interesting book, very little of the book has anything to do with software development. Most of the commentary and examples in the book are about Manufacturing, not about Software development. While the book does have value, it is mostly a decent overview of Sigma Six in general. If it is your goal to learn about Sigma Six in general, there are literally hundreds of generalist Sigma Six books in the marketplace. Hopefully, someone, someday will write a good book on Sigma Six that focuses on software. Unfortunately, the cover and title of this book does not reflect its contents."
4,Love my Data Cable,"It is so much fun to be able to quickly download my cell phone photos, easily, with my new Data Cable. It saves me the expense of emailing them to my computer. The product arrived quickly, complete, and quite inexpensive. So glad I purchased it~"
1,Was not what I ordered,"I'm sure the product was fine, but it just wasn't what i ordered, and because of that i had to pay for rush shipping to get what i actually wanted in a timely matter."
2,"cable works, software does not","The cable works fine. But the software does not. I have been using the FREE BitPim software but wanted to able to have a package that was easier to use for calendar and phonebook maitenance. SO, I tried this. The software does not recognize my phone. The form that the software brings up for you to use, looks good (exactly what I wanted) but will not communicate with my phone to transmit info back and forth. I belive that it is because my phone is on a COM port that is higher than the software recognizes (it only has COM1-Com4). I rate the cable as 5 (but I already had a cable) and the software as 0."
4,worked with vx8300,It worked well with my vx8300. However I already had a driver that I knew worked so I did not use the disc. So I cannot comment on the driver disc.
1,No CD driver = hassle,Cable received quickly and it works.BUT - I had to chase down the driver online. There was NO CD or any instructions on how to download the driver(s).The product was not even listed on the sfplanet website.Looks like this is typical for them based on other reviews.Sloppy.
1,No CD came in the cable - No customer service,The cable arrived promptly.It looks like it will work.There was no CD with the cable as was advertised.I emailed and called the vendor. They told me to download the SW of their website. I said that I paid for the CD and wanted it. They said that they would send it and never did.Avoid this vendor.
2,VX5300 my foot!,"Yes, the cable fits, but the CD driver is just for the 8300. I was not able to get it working."
1,Disappointment,"I have a LG VX5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with, was a no go. Product would not install from enclosed CD; computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed USD cord. A loss of time and money. I have since ordered, received and installed from another product - Data Point from another vendor."
2,Was almost useless to me,"I knew it was going to be a hassle when I went to install the driver from included disc and a window popped up warning me that installing this could make my system go unstable. It lists compatibility with windows xp, then it doesn't even install properly on any of my xp machines. I'm glad it worked for other reviewers, but for me it was a waste of time and energy. Gave it a 2 only because it does charge my phone while sitting around in my office"
1,It didn't work for me,"Maybe it's because this product is not approved for windows, but I couldn't get it to install."
5,Great transfer solution!,I ordered this cable to transfer information from my computer to my phone. The process of doing this is so simple even a 5yr. old could do it. I was looking for a way to add my mp3's to my phone seemlessly and I have found it. You can't go wrong with this cable.
1,did not work!,"Nothing i tried would get the driver off the disc. the driver that was prompted to me was for 6000, not for vx8300. should have just spent the extra money for the Verizon music essentials kit."
2,Disappointed in content and story line.,I was disappointed in this novel because I thought it was one of Delinsky's newer novels - some romance but a plot that is believable and makes you think and hopefully grow. Instead it was one of her older ones - what I think of as typical 70's romance trash. My mistake.
1,Reader of Delinsky,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The character is shallow and codependent. This story reads as if written by a 14 year old. Save your time and money for one of this author's newer books!
5,Really Pretty Watch,"This is a very sexy design by bulova, it looks great on my arm, kind of elegant, when the light hits it I get a lot of questions and looks. It's one of those watches that says ""im tough, but I still like to be sexy."" Buy it."
1,insultingly inadequate reissue,"The original issue of this recording would no doubt have offered adequate annotation, both on the organs used and on the pieces played. Although the pieces and composers are listed in the amazon.com page for this recording, you'll find nothing of the sort in the ""liner notes"" when you get this recording; and if you were anticipating the conscientious documentation that accompanied the original Vivarte issue, you'll be sorely disappointed. The CD came with a sticker saying ""CERTIFIED,"" per [...]. Shame on them. Shame."
5,A Book within a Book,"For me, I was immediately intrigued by the ""book within a book"" format of this novel and her descriptions of motorcycle riding! This book reminded me of another ""book in a book"" novel I read years ago, so I spent most of the book attempting to recall the other book also!Great suspense. Delinsky's great writing. Two stories to unwind, and plenty of romance. An overall good read.Oh, yes, and the other book I would recommend is John Gardner's October Light. I have ordered it to read again!"
4,Would make a great movie,Flirting with Pete would make a very interesting movie. The author kept you going by telling a story within a story. The only reason I give this book 4 stars **** is because the ending was a bit bland. Read this one!
5,Amazing,"I did not read any reviews of this book before I read the story. I didn't even read the book jacket. I sensed that this was a story I wanted to enjoy without knowing anything ahead of time. I was not dissapointed. This is a most unusual story, well written, engaging, and definitely entertaining."
5,Flirting with Pete,"This book was Recommended to me by a friend,, good book.I am new to Kindle this is my first book.."
5,"Brilliant, definitely read it",This is a wonderful book. I loved it. This is the best Barbara Delinsky book I've ever read and the best book I've read all year. It came together beautifully. I don't usually write reviews but this book was so exceptional I felt like I should.
3,Cassandra isn't my favorite Delinsky character,"Try as I might, I really didn't find much sympathy for Cassandra Ellis, the young, single, successful therapist who yearns for the father she never connected with and who lovingly tends to her comatose mother.Once her father dies, Cassandra's world is turned upside down, inside out and she reels from rather than steels for the ride.I had difficulty following the parallel story lines between Cassandra and patient/relative, the abused Jenny Clyde, and I figured out the ""mystery"" long before I should have...I even pegged Cassandra's stepmother correctly....and long before Cassandra did.Anyway, I usually like Delinsky's strong women. Cassandra seemed a little whiny to me, always looking for someone to blame for her father's self-imposed isolation, ""self-imposed"" being the operative word.The ""Jenny Clyde"" character was more interesting and certainly waged the real battles in this book.Yawn."
4,A romance/mystery novel with psychological twist....,This is romance/mystery novel that parallels two separate time frames. Psychologist Casey Ellis inherits her birth father's elegant Boston Town House and sparks fly with the handsome gardener. Casey finds a journal hidden in her father's home and sets out to solve the mystery. I would recommend this novel and anything by author Kate Angell.
2,A nice first attempt,"This isn't bad, kind of an OK first album, nothing special. There isn't alot of depth to this, either artistically or sonically(soundstage). I was very surprised that it was only 30 minutes long (lost a star for that)."
4,What a way to get started in the world of Role Playing Games,This is the boxed set for anyone interested in the wonderful world of roleplaying games set in a fantasy background. It includes all that a group of people would need for several series of adventures through dungeons solving puzzles and fighting off hordes of monsters. If you are interested in the world of AD&D games this is the first one to get.
3,Too much blame,"The author, a self admitted product of the 1960's left, keeps trying to attach evil intentions to those involved in the Pedro Pan operation. She dwells extensively on the pain of separation and points her finger at several groups that supposedly used us as pawns in a convoluted chess game. I am a Pedro Pan and I thank God every morning that I live in the United States. I know many of the participants in this book directly, Penny Powers was my sixth grade teacher, my mother was part of the underground involved in the ""rescate de la niñez"". This book reminds me of a hypothetical indictment of the crew of the Titanic for putting the children in life boats without their parents. We were in moral, physical and spiritual danger. Operation Pedro Pan, while not perfect, saved us from suffering that would have been several orders of magnitude greater had we stayed in Cuba. Read the book, but be aware of the bias."
5,A must read,"As a Pedro Pan myself I lived this story. Maria Torres's book, however, brought it back home with new insights. Well researched, ""The Lost Apple"" describes a part of American/Cuban history that has been ignored for too long. As relations between the United States and Cuba continue to thaw, I hope that Torres's book receives the attention it deserves. The more than 14,000 children the program embraced owe gratitude to Dr. Torres for documenting the politics behind a program that affected their lives. Fifty years later, we, and our children and grandchildren, say thank you. We lost the apple but gained our freedom."
5,One of the all time great books about sports in society,"Willie Morris is my hero. His book THE COURTING OF MARCUS DUPREE weaves the history of the civil rights movement into a compelling blow-by-blow description of big time college football recruiting. Aside from his incredible mastery of the English language, that is so vivid that you can smell the leaves on the autumn afternoons at the football practice, he makes startling connections between the past and present in the context of race relations. Willie Morris is my hero because his description of Marcus Dupree's touchdown run in the OU-Nebraska game in Lincoln during Marcus' freshman year is the greatest paragraph in American literature. Willie Morris is my hero because he loves dogs, and makes me want to quit my job, go on the road with my retriever, and write books."
3,Marcus,"Too much history about Philadelphia, Miss, and not enough about the recruitment of Marcus. I am only about 1/2 way into the book now. The writer does a good tale. We will see."
5,Nice,"I've only read the first couple of chapters and although it's pretty dry, it is a very very cool book"
1,Disappointing!,"I bought this album on CD when it was first released. I compaired notes with a copy of this album on LP, amd Ross Jr RUINED this classic album! The songs ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia,"" and ""Boot Scootin' Boogie."" should have been on the Low Places CD. He totally ruined ""I love a Rainy Night"" by putting dialog all over the song.For those that want the classic album, can look for it on line. The original LP had Brenda Lee singing ""Made For Each Other"" with Alvin, as well as ""Back to the Basices of Love..."" Please Ross. Stop ruining the oruginal LPs.Sorry Alvin you srruck out with this re-issue. Bagdasarian made a mess of this one...."
4,"Good book, but it doesn't detail on all the current Beanies.","This book was good, and covered many different topics. Since the book was so big and not going to be updated for a little while, there was no price guide. Also, the book did not detail on many of the Beanie Babies, there was only a picture. All in all, though, I'd say the book was rather good, and talked about many different misprints and manufacturing errors."
3,Good overall book but be warned,This was purchased for a young elementary school girl who loves horses. The description did not say that there are photos/drawings of horses reproducing. This made things a bit difficult for her parents who were forced into a discussion they hadn't planned on. I did not know about this from the description.The rest of the book had some great photos and information about horses.
3,Not that great,"The first part of the book contains a list of horse and pony breeds which are described quite comprehensively. The other parts I found a little incomplete and sketchy. The horse care basics in this book are messy, some horse sport descriptions are poor. The photos aren't of highest quality and the index contains some inaccuracies.This book will be helpful for a beginner."
3,"Not much of a game, it's more of a workout DVD","I was disappointed that this game only has about 22 ""games"" and many of them aren't games at all, but are just exercise routines you follow (ab workout, arm workout, yoga, tai chi, etc., which require very limited or no interaction with the camera anyway.) A simple workout DVD would suffice and woudl be cheaper.I found only a few of the games to be fun. You can choose what music you would like to listen to, but the selection is small and gets repetitive after a short while. If Kinetic had more games to actually play, more music, and more interaction, I would have given it a higher rating. I think they should have looked at this game more before they released it. At times getting the camera to work and getting the lighting right are difficult. You may have to move all of your furniture out of the way. On the plus side, a few of the games really do give you a workout and I would agree that this game can help you lose weight."
4,Kinetic workout,"This is a fun game that gives you a good workout. You just need to make sure you have a well lit room for the eye toy. Even my kids love this game, great for getting out aggression and tension...it's like a virtual punching bag"
4,"Good, but I'm looking for the PS3 version","The game is great. I especially like the encouragement of the virtual trainer. My only problem is that the Eye Toy is a quirky bit of equipment. And don't even think about trying to play the game without the full vision lens, because I did that and made myself sick.Really, I was looking for something I could use with my PS3 and found this. Fortunately, I have one of the old PS3's that is backwards compatible with PS2 games."
3,You need too much space,"I was so excited when I received this game. However, I had to clear out my entire basement and put in a floodlight for it to work with the eye toy. I can't get far enough back from the screen and the annoying cartoon guy keeps telling me every minute or so to step back. If it wasn't for that, it would be a lot of fun."
4,Jump and go!,"While it IS fun....it takes so great alignment to make it work almost as well as you expect....plus you need SPACE to move. Keeping those in mind, it's fun!! Also don't buy it without having a memory card."
5,Very Cool!,I just got this game and I absolutely love it! Just have enough room and enough light and you're in for the workout of a life time and is it fun!!Get this!
4,Just One Problem,"The game itself, is excellent. A great idea and put to good use to get people up and moving while having fun. The game gets you working hard and working up a sweat. It has plenty of options, like entering your weight, height, and it asks you questions to see where you should be as in difficulty.Now with the game down, this is where the problem kicks in, the camera. Eyetoys just still aren't meant for this type of game. To get this game to work you pretty much have to be in a plain white room and plenty of lighting and space. You will be tinkering with it and never get it perfect. With the camera you will become frusterated with the game. So for now, save your cash, untill they release a better camera."
1,Wortless Trash,"The product looked as it did in the photo. But when I tried to use it once opened there was no closing the tube. It is not difficult to use,it is impossible to use.If there is a trick to using this worthless contraption they need to pass it along.Don't waste your money."
2,good but screw needs adaptation.,you ll need to dig the extremity of the screw to be able to fit it on a 3mm brushless engine. the tip of the screw is too long and otherwise does not screw into the gear reliably.works good once adaptated2 stars only because of that adaptation neededenjoy
2,Tushies,"As far as wet wipes go, this isn't bad. The cloths are a little thin and theres no way you can keep the wipes in your car without them drying out. The box is flimsy, but you know--- if you're wanting to avoid chemicals and come in contact with a few less toxins during the course of your day, then these might be just what you're looking for. Don't buy the boxes... buy the refills and insert them in your Huggies wipe box. You'll be a lot better off. One final question... why not offer a tin wipe box. If folks are concerned with the chems in their wet wipes, don't you think they'd be concerned about pthalates leaching into the wipes from the plasticizers in the box? If you're going to spend a little more on healthy wipes, might as well cover all your bases!"
4,Nice wipes,These wipes work well and don't have any mystery ingredients. I just wish they were less expensive.
2,TushiesWipes,"I have been using Pampers wipes and thought I would try these natural wipes. Much better for baby, right? These are much, much rougher than Pampers. With the Pampers, I could rub and clean up really good without much redness. With these, I feel that they are too rough to wipe more than once or twice. Sometimes when I don't catch the diaper right after it's ""dirtied"" the mess is much harder to clean up--it sticks to his skin and he pretty much needs a scrub! These are much too rough to get some of the mess that sticks without fear of rubbing him raw. They are strong though, if that's what you are looking for. I'd rather have soft for my baby."
2,very rough,these might be better for my baby but they are way too rough for her delicate skin...would not buy again...
5,Great product with great results,"I have used these wipes since the day my baby was born. She has never had a rash or any problem. We also use Tushies Diapers and I think that is why her bottom is so healthy. They don't overdry, and they get her clean. The wipes are a little hard to tear with one hand, but once you have the technique down and with a little practice you can get them out no problem and still keep one hand on the baby."
2,Rough on a tender bottom...,"My son has a very sensitive bottom. After many severe diaper rashes, we went to natural wipes. We usually buy Earth's Best wipes. I decided to try something different and was very disappointed. I ended up selling the rest of the the wipes. They were rougher that the Earth's Best wipes and my son threw a bigger fit at every change. We are committed to Earth's Best wipes until he is fully potty trained."
2,Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever,"I would have to say that out of all the Andy Hardy movies I have seen this is the least entertaining. It doesn't have as good of a story line as the other ones. Basically what happens is Andy doesn't care much for his drama class...that is until he falls for the new substitute drama teacher. He improves rapidly in his class and even writes and stars in a play called ""Adrift in Tahiti."" Everyone notices the obvious difference in his age and the teachers age, well, except Andy. And he becomes heartbroken when he finds out of her engagement to another man.Like all Andy Hardy movies, this movie does have a few comical situations, but it is not near as good as the other ones."
3,For Fans of Hardy,"This is one of the weaker installments of the Andy Hardy series about the Hardy family. It begins with Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) being told he owns some land that is worth a substantial amount of money. He goes into partnership with the men and hires his daughter (Cecilia Parker) as their secretary. Andy (Mickey Rooney), meanwhile, falls in love with his new drama teacher (Helen Gilbert). To impress her, he writes the school play, an island version of Romeo and Juliet. He begins to believe that the teacher likes him to and plans to marry her, but he is in for a world of heartbreak.Normally, Rooney is animated and a joy to watch, but he seems less enthusiastic here and more juvenile. Perhaps the story is a bit dated by today's standards; no self-respecting 17 year old would behave so immaturely around a teacher."
1,i do not know I don't have it yet,"my review is going to be bad ,because they got my money and I have no DVD to watch"
1,"So, I may not be a Steven Seagal fan...","I'll watch any film that's at all watchable. But thank GOD for the Montana landscapes. And we had a good old laugh, sadly at the film. That flask and bunsen burner diagram ...just hilarious. A fair number of people walked out the cinema, but us lot, we really enjoyed it. Sometimes you get this really great comraderie feeling with your mates when you've just watched a truely awful and therefore relatively amusing movie."
2,"""These flowers will stop the virus.""","After having watched ""Marked for Death,"" ""The Patriot"" was quite disappointing. Your initial reaction might be, ""Wait a minute. This is a Steven Seagal movie. That means it is going to have lots of action!"" Well, you are gravely mistaken. Watch as Steven Seagal makes a fake ID on his home computer! Watch as Steven Seagal fails at finding a cure for the virus! Watch as Steven Seagal fails at assaulting a water dispenser! The only reason why this movie actually earned two stars is that Steven Seagal stabs his enemy in the head with a broken champagne glass...after they have become friends! Unfortunately, there are not very many funny bad lines. One of the few that comes to mind is when the military helicopter sprays flowers at the city (refer to title of review). Additionally, you can watch as Steven Seagal runs like a sissy-boy."
1,How can this even be in release?,"Terrible film. Does a real disservice to the excellent Mel Gibson movie of the same name. How is this possible, just such a short time between releases of the same title? Should be a law against it!"
5,thought it was a great movie,"I thought it was wonderful to see seagal in a different type of movie. It got his message across, It had a little bit of everything in it ,not JUST action. It had a story line that was different for him and showed him as a father and a doctor -not the old CIA or EX CIA operative. He wasn't an assassin or a cop. He was a doctor. soo his character didn't need to kill everyone he needed to find a cure and keep his daughter safe. I liked the movie a lot BECAUSE it showed him in a different role and not the same type of character he usually plays.Give the guy a break! How many action movies can one make!before they all seem the same."
3,Good Segal Film,"The Patriot has beautiful Montana scenery, a medical thriller plot, but not enough martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. The story was better than I expected it to be. It was similar to a Tom Clancy movie. But the action was minimal.Steven Segal plays a retired CIA immunologist who has opened up a small practice in cattle country. He is a widower with a half-Native American daughter. A militia extremist infects himself with a deadly contagion. Segal must battle militia men to find a cure before the plague spreads.Segal spends too much time peering into test tubes in this movie, and not enough time kicking ass. Also, his daughter acts like, ""See how cute I am?""The movie stresses the importance of protecting the environment."
1,"bad movie, bad acting: stay away from this one","What is more to add to this? The story is thinner than in the avarage action movie, Segal plays a doctor, you can't take for real, and where was the action? ..nice scenary though"
1,I timed it! less than 30 seconds of fighting!,"Seagal is a fantastic Aikido master. He makes wonderful movies and even though he only plays the same one character over and over he seems to do it well. This movie however has next to no action 27.28 seconds of fighting not including when he grabs somebody and puts a knife to their throats. Not only was the movie void of fighting, but it was flat out stupid. The acting is poor the plot is poor and the end is insulting. (the cure is flower pedal tea that knocks the plague out of you in minutes). Yeah, I almost believe that. Get another Seagal movie, most of them are okay. this one defies the norm."
1,A waste of space!,"What a complete and utter waste of time and money! Whatever possessed me to buy this on DVD? If only I had read some of the other reviews.I like most of Steven Seagal's films, but this one really stinks! If you see the 2-minute trailer you'll believe that this is going to be a really good film. But that's it! All the action in the trailer is the ONLY action you'll see. The rest of the film is 85 odd minutes of garbage.'Under Siege' proves that Mr Seagal can make a good action film if he wants. So why has he done the complete opposite with this?Arnold, Van Damme, etc., are prime examples of failing when it comes to trying to act instead of doing what they do best.If you're thinking of seeing this, DON'T!"
5,The Old Rancher & Waylon,"I was the ""Old Rancher"". My dog, Waylon, my old green truck and I did the road block scene. The little actress Camilla Belle who played Holly, his daughter, was so neat. This was her debut. She, the cast and crew loved my dog and during breaks they would come and bring him doggie gifts. We (Waylon and I) actually did 27 scenes, however, the editors left about an hour on the cutting floor. Too bad, we couldn't see the entire full length of the movie. Steven Seagal is big, handsome and an excellent professional. The co-stars were well-picked. Molly Mc Clure is special to us. The location is beautiful and environmentally outstanding. The people of Ennis, Montana are greatful for him shooting the movie there. Gene E. Carlstrom"
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!,"This was my first Steven Seagal movie. I had heard some people say that his movies were full of action, obviously they hadn't seen this one. First of all Seagal, or the rest of the cast it seems have never really acted. Second, there is less than three minutes of fighting. And third, more than half of the movie is spent on horseback, I didn't rent this to see the beautiful Montana scenery."
3,"Usual Seagal stuff. Kinda lame, he is getting old and fat.","Usual Seagal stuff. He is getting old and fat, so also slow. The best part are two cute half native american girls that appear in the movie. Watch it only if you are a hard fan of Seagal."
1,Cant rate it lower!,"What a totally silly, weak minded, and pathetic plot. Not onlyis the plot fatally flawed, the acting stinks. Add to that a politically correct story line about flower petals that can save the world, and then watch the fools drop the petals from a helicopter onto the street! If that isn't enough to make your intestines wretch, add to that, the message that only primitive indians possess truth ( if that was true why did so many of them kill each other in the precceding 3 centuries). Stuart Segal is way out of his league here, and really reeks of an ego searching for a reason to be an ego (or Segal is a ""legend in his own mind"") This movie is so dumb, you actually cheer for the bad guys! Bad movie, waste of time, don't see it."
1,The Patriot,"This order was never shipped to me. Although I had written 4 emails to the seller, I never received my order nor a reply to my emails. I had to file a claim with Amazon.com to receive a refund of the purchase price. However, I plan to get this movie somewhere else in the near future, as this is an excellent movie, I have rented it many times, and enjoy watching it each time. Thank you for your time."
5,The Patriot Steven Segal,Just love this movie of rural america. Love the theme of germ warfare and the idiots who think this is ok to stockpile. Steven Seagal makes an excellent father image for his little girl and also a Doctor of Medicine as an educated Part Native American. A fine thriller.
2,"It's no ""Out For Justice"" but better than ""Out For A Kill""","Not a lot of action. Not a lot of fights. Not much of anything. Just a bunch of extemists spreading a virus in a small Montana town. But how lucky that town is. There happens to be a martial arts expert who also finds cures for diseases who lives in that town. Steven Seagal looks pretty bored most of the time. It has some minor suspenseful moments here and there. You probably won't go bragging to your friends about how great this movie was. This movies best performance was by the head baddie, Gailard Sartain. (Hollywood Knights, The Real McCoy) He seemed to fit the charactor perfectly.Definitely not one of Steven Seagal's best. As far as I know, this movie didn't win an Academy Award for best picture, or best screenplay. At least it's better than most Van Damme movies."
3,one of the better steven seagal action in depth movies,"great scenery-sensitive material presented in a realistic manner. the family inner action displayed beautifully. ""Wesley and Holly"" were a perfect example of close family ties. Enjoyed the action scenes as well as the complex subject matter. Can not wait till it can be purchased at video stores."
2,not exciting,"This is one of Seagal's lesser efforts. All actors end up in some clunkers and this is one of Steven's. I feel he's been in 12 great movies and so it's not unusual to have some duds. The Patriot, The Foreigner, Out For A Kill, and Ticker are duds, but the other dozen films are worth a look and fun stuff."
2,Can I have fries with that?,"What happened to Steven Seagal? Ever since the profound success of Under Siege he has put on more and more weight. (I must confess that he was fatter in Glimmer Man though.) Does he tell the director to suddenly cut because there's a pie baking in his trailer he must eat? Geez, how can he hope to do any more fight scenes with that belly? He has had to resort to fast motion, panoramic camera shots and bad wardrobe tricks to hide his girth. And what is with this movie? Does Seagal think he's an actor? Where does he get off playing a semi-serious role? This is unnacceptable. Either go back to cracking skulls every 15 minutes a movie or retire to Tibet to be with the Buddhists, who hail him as a reincarnated cheeseburger."
1,this movie is just not right...,"ok, what can I say. THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE! who ever thought of segal as a serious actor??? this is the most stupid and boring movie I have ever seen!!! I found myself wanting to go and do dishes or mow the lawn or vaccume the floor or do somthing besides watch this poor excuse for a movie but I sat it out in hopes there would at least be some pointless action in the end like there always is in segals movies. Boy was I disappionted! when it got to the end I couldnt belive what I was watching. (tea leaves from the heavens???) what is this garbage???? for god sakes spare yourself the tourture of watching this movie."
4,good,"Another Steven Segal film of the good guy against the bad guys. If you like Steven Segal, you like this one."
4,Great Maybelle,To hear a great voice (I try to avoid the superlative)in a wonderful setting look no further : this is IT! I think this is the best compilation of Maybelle(or any other singer in the R&B/jazz/Blues field) EVER!
3,"Looks great, sounds so... so...","I was really looking forward to this Toshiba MP3 player. I'll get to the point.Good:1. The build of this device is very solid, very good.2. Very nice color LCD.3. Different background themes.Bad:1. Audio quality. You can hear distortion in the higher and lower frequencies. Making it a poor device if you care about audio quality.2. Navigation is not as simple as some of the other ones in the market.3. Poor software that comes with the device.Outside of the device itself, I find the Toshiba Customer Support folks not to be very helpful. From the conversation, it seems they are aware of the audio problem but would deny it till the cow comes home.I am torn on this device. I want to give it a five-star, but with all the problems with it plus a poor customer support team, I am forced to give it a three-star. Maybe if they fixed the audio problem, I would upgrade my rating."
5,very pleased,"This has met all my expectations. It loads the music very easily and I can create playlists in any manner I want. I am not all that interested in downloading music, mostly loading it with my cds. My only complaint is that reading the names of some of the playlists on the screen can be a bit slow if the name is long. It scrolls by, but moves slowly. But overall I am very pleased with it. I keep expecting the hard drive to fill up, but it just keeps taking on more and more."
4,toshiba gigabeat 20gig audio player,"great product, great price, however the Ipod world is cut off so it becomes underwhelming. Harvey Bragg"
4,A HITCHCOCKIAN SUSPENSE-THRILLER!,"Cathy and Jane (Michele Dotrice and Pamela Franklin) are two pretty British nurses taking a bicycle tour of rural France. The women stop on the side of the road and have an argument; Jane leaves the scene, while Cathy stays behind. Jane returns a few moments later only to discover that her friend has mysteriously vanished. As if that weren't distressing enough, Jane learns that the area Cathy disappeared from is the same site where a lady tourist was found murdered a few years earlier. Engaging suspenser with taut direction by Robert Fuest and good acting from Franklin as the worried heroine. Also, Ian Wilson's striking photography of the French countryside doesn't hurt one bit."
3,For Uk Thriller Afficianados Only,"I normally love Robert Fuest's work, and this is a change from his usual - much of it is shot outdoors and there is none of the surrealistic set detail of the kind found in the 'Dr Phibes' movies or 'The Final Programme', which allows the viewer to enjoy another facet of this underrated director. While this is a subtle and original film (which benefits from a great transfer onto DVD) it is a little overlong and the constant too-ing and fro-ing of the characters between a handful of locations (while being a credible and realistic means of telling the story) does get a little dull at times - if the feature had been fifteen minutes shorter, the structure would have been far more taut and exciting, while the lack of any real gore or shockingly violent scenes ultimately mean that the film lacks punch. Therefore, I'd say it's for thriller fanatics only - if you like horror, this may be too subtle for you."
4,Nice spice rack,"This is a nice spice rack. I had no problems with the jars or lids, and liked that it came with labels. The rack turns beautifully too. I would recommend it if you need a rack that will hold a lot of spices. Also shipped quickly."
5,Amazing guide to everything New Jersey!,"I received this as a gift and haven't been able to stop reading it. It makes the most wonderful gift--it must weigh ten pounds! It's a massive guide to everything you'd ever want to know about New Jersey. When you read one entry it leads you to another, and so on, which makes for compulsive reading. There is even an entry for the small town where I grew up, South River, New Jersey. I don't think any family in New Jersey should be withtout this book - it's also great for research papers for school. This encyclopedia should make all New Jerseyans proud of our great state!"
3,hmm..,"How many of you guys bought this thing for Mark Wasserman's class at rutgers? It was one of the required readings...man, he was a great professor and History of Mexico was great."
3,Pretty decent paper trimmer,"It does what I need it to do. The cuts aren't always PERFECTLY straight, but they are close enough. If I could go back in time I would get a guillotine style trimmer."
3,Expensive,"Nice idea, but be aware that it require 2 things: It requires you to know how to use the product. Read the manual. This is not as easy as it looks.Secondly, if you are like me, where you will be cutting lots of paper, then its a smart idea to invest in replacement blades.The replacement blades can be very expensive over time. I have gone through 3 already. I am starting to look at alternatives as well. So far, I have found none. I with they could have made this a little more economical.Otherwise its a good product."
5,Excelent Product for the money spent,"This Craft Trimmer is just what the Doctor Ordered. Its construction, fit, and mechanical percision is as good as you would see in an office grade product at a much better price point. If you need a cutter/trimmer for crafting or general use i would not hesitate to recommend this one. I use it in my small business and it performs flawlessly."
3,Russian English Dictionary,"This is a pretty one-sided book. First off, it doesn't elaborate on anything at all. In other words, you must already be pretty proficient in both languages before using this book. It's not for beginners who don't already understand that grammatical concepts of both languages."
4,"Good saw, bad sheath","I bought this saw for myself for Christmas. The saw looks and feels good, but I can't get it in the sheath. The saw bites into the plastic insert making it next to impossible to get the saw completely inside the sheath. This complicates carrying the saw in my daypack. Good saw, bad sheath."
5,GREAT book on Exchange 2003 Security!!,"If you're going to pick up a book on Microsoft Exchange Server security, this is *the* book for you. Great and comprehensive coverage on everything to do with Microsoft Exchange Server from one of the foremost Exchange Security experts in the industry. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is seriously interested in understanding what's entailed in Exchange-related security, including some ground-breaking content on compliance (Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPPA, SEC, etc.) and legislation pertaining to e-mail ... which alone is well worth the price of the book! Highly recommended!!"
5,One of thier best,"One of the great strengths of TNG was it's cast, and two of the best (Michelle Forbes, Levar Burton) dominate in a well-paced story. Ensign Ro and Geordi LaForge find themselves slightly out of phase with the rest of the universe, and they employ heroic efforts to get back in time to keep the Enterprise from disaster. Sounds like your basic potboiler, but the complications and humorous twists make for solid entertainment, with a genuine cliffhanger ending."
4,Fender strat,Cry of Love = one of the best Fender sounds in years. The songs are also very good but I love that Fender!!
5,"Five stars... well, not really","All I remember is the song, ""Peace Pipe,"" which completely rocked, but the vocals you would swear were Billy Squier.Burn down the sacred ground!Tear the Temple down!In the name of God, somehowBurn down the sacred ground!I have no idea who or where these guys are now."
4,An fine piece of Southern BLues Rock,"I bought this C.D for the opening riff from 'Peace pipe'and found that after one listening I was going to be listening to this one for a while. I would, and have recommended this C.D to anyone who ever enjoyed Jimi Hendrix, Lynard Skynard, Bad Co., etc. Similarities aside I would argue that this is not a rip off C.D. but instead a group of very good musicians who put out a very good first effort."
5,Hear What You've Been Missing...,"It's a shame that this album got lost in a sea of grunge in 1993. I guess I can understand why after all these years. It was a curse that Cry of Love could write great songs, outplay most bands that were around, and make a record that had depth to it. AHHHH! Maybe their guitars and vocals being in tune was like nails on a chalkboard to rock listeners. Well, enough sarcasm. This is a fine album. It's real. When ""Brother"" was released, it was like a discovering a ""new"" classic rock record. Years later, it still feels classic yet refreshing. You should purchase this album for no other reason than to hear the guitar genius of Audley Freed. Hear the talent being suppressed by the Black Crowes. Could you imagine if the Robinson brothers set their egos aside and let Audley do his thing? My only complaint with ""Brother"" is that it should have been a double album."
4,Anyone miss Free?,"If so, then this album is for you. Pure, simple, blues-driven rock music - sound familiar? No wonder they're often compared to Bad Company but their sound is bluesier, more like Free, if anything. It's a pity they packed it in because if there ever was a band to give The Black Crowes (TBC) a run for the money then Cry Of Love was it. Not as soulful as TBC nor as daft as The Four Horseman (there's a place for them too!), but superb songs well played & with real feeling. They could cut it live too. If you want to hear more of Audley Freed's great guitar work just check out TBC live. I'm buying this CD again as a gift for a mate but having to do so from the US since it's deleted in the UK - shame!"
5,"Fantastic comedy, time well spent","Don't pass this by -- it's enchanting, well-written comedy that you won't be able to stop watching. Dawn French is adorable in this."
5,A Great Series,"If you love French and Saunders like I do, this is the series for you. Joanna Lumley is also a favorite of mine , though she's not in theseries often or for very long, she is a great addition to the cast. Very Funny !"
2,disapointment,"What a disapointment, I LOVED season one, All the women of the village and the funny way they live, then came season two, I waited a long time for it to come out on DVD. Like I said what a disapointment.I bought it on Amazon.com I have watched it once and probably will not watch it again"
4,"Awesome show, very entertaining!","Clatterford is very entertaining. If you liked ""Calendar Girls,"" you will certainly love this cast of women! They are charming, corky, and, overall, fun to watch! Dawn French is a hit in this show. She is a mentally challenged individual, who actually may be more sane than people think. Her character brings some of the issues being confronted by the women to the surface, but in such an unexpected way. In the U.K., this show is entitled, ""Jam & Jerusalem."" I am not sure if they have aired the third season, but I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. This show also has some of the same characteristics of, ""The Vicar of Dibley,"" which was created by Richard Curtis (Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral...). Both shows deal with a set of characters that you get to know, who are endearing and fun to watch! Have fun watching ""Clatterford."""
5,Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in this one...Wonderful!,"This is great show and the cast is wonderful, full of names you'd know from shows produced either by Jennifer Saunders and or Dawn French.Women this is a treat!"
4,a good start...,"This DVD is a good start for anyone who has absolutely NO experience with Yoga. It is easy to use, the pace is slow for those who need it, and it includes a fairly good number of exercises for the beginner to practice. However, I thought it would be a good supplement to my regular classes, but found that I quickly outgrew it."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"I wore out my antique tape version of the first Yoga For Beginners, but this follow-up went into the recycling bin. First, I don't want (or expect) advertising at the beginning of any kind of workout DVD. Second, there's too much Pretty Stuff and not enough solid instruction. Third, the poses are mostly floor asanas, and not ones I would have chosen for a gentle beginner's DVD. There are better DVDs out there. Don't waste your money."
1,I Don't Have This Book,"I don't have this Yoga book, so I rally can't rate it but wouldn't mind having it but don't know that I ordered it eithe."
5,A classic!,"I first received this book when I was very young, and enjoyed it completely. Through various household moves the book was packed and unpacked with other childhood treasures, and at every unpacking I would sit down and read it again. Now as an adult I still enjoy an occasional sit down with Sampson the Cat and the rest. A clever story, suspense <and suspension>, and humor, combined with hilarious illustrations makes for a great read for young and old alike"
3,"Okay if required, but","The Anton book appears to be the standard in teaching undergrad LA, but I personally didn't like it very much. Part of the problem is due to several misprints in the early chapters. Some of the definitions of basic concepts are confusing at best, wrong at the worst. I found myself relying on the Hubbard-Hubbard ""Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms"" to get through the course. The explanations were more concise and easier to understand. If you'r eteaching yourself, Hubbard-Hubbard is the way to go."
3,Think Again,I read the online review and thought that it seemed like a great buy. I mainly wanted a blender that could crush ice for smoothies. You do have to stick the wooden spoon inside of this one and it never quite crushed all the ice. For regular blending it is great.
1,doesn't work,"Wanting to make smoothies, and knowing nothing about blenders, I did some research online and asked for help from a houseware store that I shop at frequently. The salesperson suggested I go with the 14 speed Hamilton Beach, as it is inexpensive and popular. He encouraged me to try it out and return it if I wasn't satisfied. I wasn't (I realized I wanted to be able to crush ice with without having to add liquid.) So I returned it for the 56400. Once I added my yogurt, fruit and ice cubes, I turned the 56400 on. Although it made a lot of noise, nothing was happening! I waited and waited. I used a spatula (once the blades stopped, of course). I used a spoon. Nothing! After several minutes, most of the ice cubes were still just that - cubes and and although the yogurt did blend with the raspberries, there were still some whole strawberries! I used a straw to suck up whatever I could, cleaned it and returned it. Now I'm in the market for a blender once again. I sure could use a margarita!"
1,A Kitchen Nightmare,"I bought this blender. The first time I used it, it immediately began to smoke. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for the same blender. The second blender did the same thing.This blender is scary.I ended up going with a less expensive blender and am very happy with it."
5,Hard to put down. Must start with the first book - Great!,"A boy growing up, starting at the end of the Civil War. His father comes home after the war and they head west. They make friends with a famous mountain man who takes in the boy after his father dies. He teaches the boy everything to survive in the mountains.He becomes Smoke Jensen, a gunfighter by necessity and has many adventures. Marries and together begin ranching and fighting the badmen from Colorado to New York. Smoke fights for the helpless and his home. This is a series of books the start with ""The Last Mountain"". Also a short series about the mountain man, starting with ""The First Mountain Man"". Both series never get boring. In fact, they are hard to put down. The only western series I've enjoyed next to Louis Lamour's series ""The Sackets""."
3,DID NOT LIKE VERY MUCH,Not a very good book did not keep my attention finished reading it because I didn't want to waste my money.
2,two books in one,"Some of the rewiews were saying this is as good as Louis L'Amour writtings, first book was good, secound book only fair, would I buy from William Johnstone again - I think so."
2,Disappointing video,"My daughter loves Blue, but this video was very disappointing. We have other Blue's Clues videos and they get played over and over. My daughter choses her own videos from her collection and she never choses to watch this one."
3,NOTHING MORE...NOTHING LESS....,The running time of this CD is very short!! But you don't have to worry about no-feeling-of-great movie. There are ELVIS' hound dog and Marc Isham's great score & some US Marine's chord.
3,nice gift for new teachers,"This book is full of helpful ideas. I purchased it as a gift for a new teacher, who loves it. As a veteran teacher, I did not find the advice especially original, but I also know that many of the strategies in this book are things I learned by experience and not in teacher education classes. This would be an excellent book for student teachers and first-year teachers; they will feel more prepared to deal with the day-to-day challenges of teaching."
5,I have had this book for 4 years and still use it,"During my second year of teaching the author of this book came to talk to the new hires at the district I had just moved too. She was amazing and she signed and donated 2 copies to the door prizes. Being the second person whose name was called I of course choose this book. It was full of wonderful ideas! When my friend began teaching the following year in high school (I teach elementary) I bought her a copy as well, she said she loves it. It is great for all age levels!"
3,An enjoyably suspenseful slasher.,"A group of actors rehearsing a play are trapped in the theater with a madman on the loose. Michele Soavi's debut film begins rather weakly, but gets rolling at the forty-minute mark, and doesn't let up till the very end. Plenty of suspense, scares, and gore to please genre fans, though the final scene is rather lame and tiresome. Still, who would have thought a guy dressed in an owl suit could be creepy?*** 1/2 out of *****"
1,Yet another 'Groove-y' gaming failure.,"Had i known this was a Groove Games product, i would have saved the money i wasted on the game&shipping charges and bought ice cream instead. Every game i have ever seen from Groove has been shlocky to play and had loading problems. never again."
4,Just mine experience..........,"Hi fellows, I bougth this product and I had nothing to regret. Amazon shipped it in 2 days like he promise and I recieved it in 4 day because I'm an international customer.(from Curaao)The game is in perfect condition arrived to me. Thanks many thanks again for your service and the game itself is intersting.The game is very friendly and have different skill levels. It's easy to install too and it is just like they discribe it, you feel like your there in World War 2.Thanks again,Satisfied Customer"
5,I was blown away by this book.,"This book discusses the difference between visual and linquistic thinking, and shows how some of the greatest thinkers had linquistic problems but had hyper-visualization abilities. Great book for the parent of a gifted child who has problems writing, reading or listening."
3,Innovative,"This author challenges the status quo about learning and creativity. His ideas challenge you think and re-visit your preconceptions.On the other hand, his writing style is difficult and repetitive. Although interested I found it difficult to finish this book."
2,"Yes, An Irony",I bought this book thinking it will give me great insights on alternative ways of thinking and working but it's just another popular propaganda without any real substance.The psychology in the book is nothing but folk theories.
3,50/50,"The book is okay. For the class that I was taking it for, IEPs, it didn't do a great job of walking me through the process. However, it is easy to read and the stories of actual teachers are well written."
4,Even your odds if an audit is scaring you !,"This book contains 163 questions and indepth answers about the IRS and the law, and should serve as a handbook for dealing with the IRS in nearly every situation you will encounter. Although the IRS is auditing less than before, if you are one of the ""lucky and chosen"" ones, this book will be a help in understanding the threats and intimidation that the IRS likes to wield on taxpayers. Daniel Pilla is the best author on the subject of the IRS - his books are easy to read, get to the point, and are a real aid to taxpayers."
4,Great,"It's incredible to think of the work that went into making this book. I really enjoy the examples given with nearly every entry in the reference section.I think that Colin's extensive research uncovered attributes of ActionScript that weren't previously considered by the designers, giving the language more power.I would probably only plead for more client-server integration discussion, but understand that it was covered briefly, is not fully within the scope of the book and would consume a lot of space."
5,Drooling :)...,"This was the most highly anticipated book for the Flash community in recent memory... If you do not have it, buy it. It is invaluable. This book will teach you ""how to talk to Flash,"" enlighten novices and experienced coders alike, and it is simply a joy to read. Long live Colin Moock!"
5,This book is truly EPIC!!!,I have learned heaps from this book. It is brilliant. I can't say enough to do it justice. The first section clearly explains flash mx concepts and applications of same. The second section is an exhaustive reference section written in an informative and friendly tone. It's not dry or tedious reading.The author is widely experienced with Flash. That comes through loud and clear. He very effectively passes on his experience and skills in this book.Having put a lot of new flash stuff into production after reading this book I can also vouch for it's accuracy. The stuff he says in the book works perfectly. I haven't found any errors.This book is ACE!!! I wish all books were so thorough and informative. Only a mug wouldn't get this one.Hope this helps.
5,The Defacto learning tool and resource for every Actionscripter,"This book has it all; an overview to general programming, a focus on Actionscript specific problems, solutions, and workflow, and a resource that's value lasts long into expert level Actionscripting."
2,Horrible,"I have read 98% of the offerings from the BL and have to say this is the worst novel yet. Usually they manage to print only the best of the short stories submitted but this novel misses the mark. The author fails to capture any of the atmosphere of the gothic world of Warhammer. All the ingredients are there but I couldn't help feeling I was reading a screen play. If this is the first novel from either Warhammer or warhammer 40k you read, please don't get turned off. Try William king or Dan Abnett as examples of the best this genre has to offer."
5,Still worth getting,"Even though Columbia put out an incomplete ""complete"" Peggy Lee & Benny Goodman 2 CD set in 1999, this earlier 1993 edition produced by Michael Brooks is still worth buying: The complete, unclipped version of ""That Did It, Marie"" is offered here instead of the shortened version on the 1999 set, plus there's an alternate take of ""Not a Care in the World"""
3,Good effort but !!! ....,"Good effort but !! .... although this game was outsourced to Shift (creator of that old DEVIL DICE), the idea was very good but it lacks still the humor and brightness of orignal creators of Sony for the highly brilliant APE ESCAPE on PS ...."
3,"If it ain't broke, why fix it???!!!","This is the 3rd release from Bill Perry and, in my opinion, the weakest of the three. The songs are much less dark, brooding, and personal which was a trademark of his previous releases. The man is still a monster on lead guitar, but the songs themselves are not up to par with his best stuff. I think that part of the problem is that his input on this cd (songwriting, production, etc.) is not what it was compared to his first two excellent releases. The result is a great blues musician trying to overcome average and stylistically ill suited material. My suggestion would be to find ""Love Scars"" and ""Greycourt Lightning"" to get a true feel of what Bill is capable of doing. Get this cd only after hearing the first two."
1,Where's Bill Perry?,"I recognize the guitar work, but everything else reeks of a heavy-handed producer more concerned with seeing his own name in lights (and no doubt the financial returns) than the integrity of the artist. I much preferred Bill's own song-writing on his last cd. I can appreciate the desire for a more commercial approach, but not at the risk of losing the raw energy and quirky talents of the man himself.Purchase ""Greycourt Lightning"" or ""Live At Manny's Carwash"" if you want the real deal."
3,No advantage over VHS version,"I bought the DVD so I could click right to the part I wanted. It isn't set up that way. GAIAM merely transferred the VHS tape to DVD without putting in any chapters so I have to fast forward to get to the part I want, just like in the VHS version. In addition, the quality of the picture is not as crisp as DVD movies I watch. Great scenery of Yosemite (the other reason I bought it), but otherwise if you have the VHS version, don't get this one."
4,good warm-up for zen sitting,"If you are deepening your meditation, and longer sitting is required, then try the Rodney Yee yoga techniques. They will loosen the thighs, hips and lower back considerably. A zen practioner's various lotus positions will greatly benefit from Yee's wholistic approach. He manages to stretch muscles and tendons in subtle and profound ways. Give this DVD a try when you're in need of some strengthening before sitting for the longer spells."
3,wouldn't fit on camera,"The lens was O.K.. I just couldn't get it to fit on the camera. It was supposed to fit on my daughters kodak easy share 35mm. We were in Africa at the time and really ended up breaking her favorite camera, trying to get this lens to work. So, I actually still have the lens but the camera is trashed."
4,Bought these speakers for my office,"To use for streaming media, CDs and with my Ipod. The only thing I don't like about them is that the power cord is rather short. Other than that they are a great bargain for the price and quality."
3,Smokefest 1996 - Well worth the watch!!!,"Well i ordered this video after watching the video Smokefest 2 which i really enjoyed... It was basically the same, with some unreal live footage from the concerts, especially in the UK!!! For those of you who really love Snoop and those of you who enjoyed Smokefest 2 its well worth the watch!!"
3,"Love the labels of green, yellow, and red...","I love the labels of green, yellow, and red, so easy to read...it is very easy to follow. I don't need to lose weight, but, I do like to follow the low G.I. diet, and this book makes it easy for me to get the basic concept. I am not a fan of using artificial sweeteners and processed foods though..."
2,"Thought this book would be good. I like the Red Light/Green Light, but...",The big but about this book is that it instructs users to use a lot of artificial sweeteners and processed foods. There needs to be balance and there are other GI books out there that don't instruct their users to use chemicals as a way to lose weight.
5,love this book!,This is an easy to read and understand book of information about the food we eat. It tells what is the best food to eat and what not to eat. You don't starve yourself. It gives great recipes along with a grocery list of foods to buy (and all are found in your grocery store). This is not a diet only the right way we need to eat. It also gives lists of grams of carbs in foods. That's important in the foods we eat. You learn what foods are good carbs and bad and how to balance them with proteins. A lot of this information I did not know. Now I know how to eat better.
2,"Review of ""The GI Diet"" by Rick Gallop","I used to have a book on the Glycemic Index and I really liked it but unfortunately I loaned it to someone who keeps forgetting to return it. I bought this book, hoping it would be a good reference also but it was very disappointing compaired with the other book. The other book had a white cover and the title was The Revolutionary GI Diet. I can't remember the author. This book did not have very many foods to reference for their GI number and the recipes were very disappointing. In general it was just not as interesting or as informative. I think that this book was published the other one, so you would think that there would be more information. Anyway, if you are looking for a good GI reference book, get that one because it is alot better (you can still order it on Amazon, which is what I wish that I would have done instead of wasting my money on this book)!"
2,Look at Credentials!!!!!,"I don't see an ""M.D."" behind the presumptive by-line of ""'MISTER' Gallop""--unlike the THREE (count 'em!)""M.D.'s"" and a layman who gave us ""Sugar Busters""!!Admittedly, I didn't thoroughly read Gallop's book (like I have with ""Sugar Busters""), but after a quick skim-read and making a few comparisons, I quickly decided that I'm gonna stick with the doctors!!! They convinced me that they know what they're talking about--at least more than Mr. Gallop!!No offense to Mr. Gallop, but that's just the way I see it!Incidentally, I have absolutely no connection to any of these people! I'm just an ""ordinary Joe"" who tries to pay attention to what's going on!!!"
5,love it,This is the first diet book that has made sense to me. I have been following his advice now for over a month and have lost 8 pounds. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has been trying to diet and has not succeeded in the past.
2,"The GI Diet - the easy, healthy way to permanent weight loss",The information is fine but the print on all the charts is so small on a dark background and is near impossible to read.
2,snoozfest,There is too much scientific info that you dont need to read. The first part of the book has you wanting to give up before you even get to the diet plans. Not a recomendation from me.
1,Kindle Version is currently worthless,"I'm sure all the reviews of this book have been honest in their praise which leads me to believe the print version is excellent, but if you're looking at the Kindle version, DO NOT buy it. As you can imagine, a book with red, yellow, and green lists is just about worthless on a Kindle. In addition, the dozens and dozens of charts are so small they are unreadable unless you've got a magnifying glass handy. Sure, you can change the font to larger typeface, but the charts remain the same size--and that size is ""tiny.""I've contacted amazon.com about this problem and they're going to get back to me if the publisher has a newer edition with clear charts and identifiable ""colors"" but in the meantime, I'd steer clear of this if you're buying for Kindle. ADDITION: I just got my Kindle Fire and it makes a world of difference. The book formats great on the Fire."
3,Good book for beginning the diet,"This book is helpful to give you an idea of what to eat for the low GI diet. It has some sample recipes but needs sample menus too. There are food lists with green, yellow or red lights which are easy to follow. However, it is not very extensive and I am looking for more informative lists with actual values now. Still, it's a good starting point."
4,THE G.I. DIET,I have read the book but have not tried this diet. It sounds excellent and I believe it would be a successful diet.
3,Good book,Another good weight loss book. Be ready to be dedicated though. I guess I need a different mindset to use this.
4,Good and simple!,The truth is that I sort of knew how the GI diet worked but with this book it was all crystal clear. It is VERY easy to understand and it's not hard to follow at all. It was especially useful to me because I am one of those people that crave carbs and now I know why. I recommend this book!
1,misrepresentation,thought that this was a downloadable DVD and turned out to be only a viewable show. requested a purchase price refund !
3,I Think We're Done Here,Hmmmmm......the show is getting kind of boring.....I think this is the last one we're going to rent.Good try though.
3,Portlandia is a good idea that falls short.,"Portlandia could be a great series but the production quality and editing is so amateurish that it falls flat. With a good writer and a budget it could be great. As it is, it flops."
5,This show is refreshing and really funny.,"I love the chemistry between Fred Armisen (Saturday NIght Live) and Carrie Brownstein (lead guitarist/singer for Wild Flag and former member of the band Sleater-Kinney). It's set in Portland, an unassuming city for a sketch comedy series. But it uses every stereotypical and not to mention charming aspects of the city to come up with some great, intelligent comedy."
3,It's Funny But.....,"It's funny but, it seems like the joke is the same over and over and over and over.......Always a different skit but, somehow they all seem the same."
5,epic,"this show was awesome. watched it as nothing better to do , this week have been anticipating new episode. so funny . The dream of the 90's is alive in Portland!!!"
2,meh,"OK for the first half of each skit, then it gets boring. Probably won't watch any more. I dunno. it's just not that hilarious like everyone says"
2,oops,"Don't you hate it when they fumble the ball on a good idea?Instead of a hilarious parody of granola head pretension and smug self-righteousness,the show is merely juvenile."
2,It just wasnt that funny,"we laughed, a little, at first, but it just isnt Danny DeVito, rolling in your seat funny. it is a little funny and thats it."
4,"Great show, but might not be for everybody","I love this show so much! The writing is funny and smart, and there are definitely things that have made me laugh out loud. (Plus, I feel like these characters are recognizable for anywhere - I live in South Brooklyn and I've seen people like them here plus the two other places I've lived on the East Coast :)) Now the addendum: I've found that you either really like the show, or you think it's the dumbest thing ever, as evidenced from friends of mine that watch it. It's not for everyone, but if you've ever lived in any populated area with tons of hipsters around, you can appreciate it."
2,Just don't get it,"I just don't get the humor, maybe after a few episodes it will grow on me? Disappointed, it was recommended by a lot of people."
4,Good fun,"I have to say, I have only caught the new season , so I went back and bought this set. I think these are fun, but it seemse like everyone upped their game for the second season which I feel is much better than the first. Either way, good, too close to reality fun."
4,Portlandia is always fun.,A pretty good episode from the first season. A few Portlandia episodes remind me of my visits there and probably why I'm still in the midwest!
4,Not quite Portland,"First off if you enjoyed Flight of the Concords and/or Little Britain then you will probably like this show as it is a mix between the two.As a sketch comedy this show is well done and amusing to watch so it is a success in that regard. However as someone who was I was born and raised in Portland, OR I would say this show fails as a look at what makes Portland special or unique. Yes there are the types of people you see in this show in Portland in larger amounts then you would see elsewhere, but that isn't what makes the city unique (thou it may seem that way to outsiders).Bottom line if you want a decent off the wall sketch comedy then check this out, but don't expect a accurate look at what makes Portland, OR different then other cities."
4,dry and funny,"I purchased this as a christmas present for my wife after we watched a couple of episodes. Definitely worth the money, very funny... might not be for everyone's sense of humor, but certainly worth checking out. good, dry former grunge-era adults"
2,"Lukewarm satire, more miss than hit....","The overly PC types that Portlandia mocks here deserve to be skewered. They've been cruising for years on their sanctimonious soapboxes for years without anyone calling them out for their holier than thou attitude. Unfortunately, Portlandia's target is right on the money, but the series itself is lukewarm at best. Most of the sketches are mildly amusing at best, excruciatingly long and tedious at worst. Basically, the writers (or the actors, the series feels like it's almost all improvised) come up with a funny conceit, but then drag it out for several minutes without ever expanding on it, and worst of all, the scenes/sketches don't get funnier as they progress. A lot of times they use rapid cutting to make up for the lack of content, in an attempt to make it ""funnier"" (and it fails). It's very mild, lukewarm satire."
2,"No Closed-Caption Subtitles & Flimsy Carton, But Great Comedy!","The season one Blue-Ray/DVD doesn't include closed caption subtitles, a real bummer for those who can't always hear Fred's sometimes mumbling character dialog. Also, the flimsy paper package doesn't exactly stand up for dvd shelf storage (note: Made in Mexico) but otherwise this dvd features great unique comedy!Also purchased season two blue-ray, which does include the CC subtitles but also has the flimsy paper carton packaging & Made in Mexico stamp."
4,a great first novel by a new author...,"Inspirational Romance:Book Description (from Back-cover):""Ann Langley encounters surprising hostility in beautiful Key West.Why do so many people object to this condominium complex being built? Ann wonders. After all, it would be good for Key West's economy.Only when she meets scuba diver and treasure hunter Nick Carmichael does Ann begin to get some answers to her question. As she learns more about why her company chose the site and why Mick objects to it, she faces a terrible challenge: Must she chose between the job she loves and the attraction she feels for this handsome forthright man? Will Ann let Nick rekindle the faith she has set aside for other goals?""****A sweet love story with surprisingly quite a bit of suspense. I enjoyed this Heartsong Presents novel and was pleasantly surprised that a male wrote it. The romantic slant reminded me slightly of Nicholas Sparks -- a great first novel by a new author. I would read more of his work."
5,mp3 download is a great deal!,"hey this is good Cecil Taylor stuff, well recorded, and I like it along with all the other stuff I have by him (which is a lot).And right now (Oct. 2009) the mp3 download is only $1.78 USD! can't beat that, for a whole hour of Cecil Taylor with drums and marimba and brass....."
1,Does not open cans,"This can opener, no matter what you do, which way you hold the can, what size can, etc. does NOT open cans. It LOOKS like a can opener, makes a noise like a can opener, but it does not work. Look elsewhere if open cans are what you seek."
1,Can not use. Terrible,"I have tried to ""get the hang"" of using it and have not. I bought a black and decker and am very happy with it. If I could send it back to Amazon for a refund, I would but the shipping and time make it not worth it. I am now reluctant to buy small appliances through the mail for this reason."
1,Non-working can opener,"I ordered this on January 22 and when it arrived it did not work. I repacked it and sent it back to you via express mail. I have not heard from you about its arrival nor the credit on my account. Please clear this up right away if you wish to keep me as a customer.Signed, Jane A. Palisca"
1,Do NOT Buy; Does NOT Work,"I have a hand held smooth cut opener, so I know how to use this product. I bought this for my elderly parents, hoping to get them a safer and easier alternative for opening cans. I tried several typed of cans and this product did not work on any of them. I finally got it to cut part of one, after holding it for about 3-5 minutes. This is ridiculous. Amazon should pull this product (instead of continuing to offer it at lower and lower prices.) Do not waste your time; this can opener does not OPEN cans!"
3,Good idea---but,"I really like the way it releases the top of the can from the bottom of the can. Problem is that it does not seem to work on all cans. Some cans I need to turn upside down to get the can opener to work. When it does work, it is a thing of beauty, and I love it. When it does not work, I get out the side release HAND can opener and get the job done. Would I buy it again--probably not."
3,Hamilton Beach 76600 Smooth Edge Can Opener,"I had one of these that worked great for over 4 years. When it finally failed I found that Walmart stopped selling them. I found them on Amazon and purchased one. The one I received didn't work, the motor runs but does not open anything. I ordered a second one and it opens cans but not as well as the one I purchased over 4 years aga. Hamilton Beach has a horrible quality control problem now. You have a 50% change on getting one that actually works."
5,5 years & still going strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i've had this can opener 4 more than 5 years & have never had a problem!!! i even let my 4-year old niece use it when she stays with me & helps me cook. never have 2 worry about anything with this one!
1,What a PIECE of JUNK!,"I have been an excellent customer of Amazon.com, and really rely on the reviews of all their items. This Can Opener, does not open ANY CANS! I wrote Hamilton Beach, and emailed them about their so called Marvelous Can Opener, If I even had a chance of returning this to Amazon I would, but it was bought for a Christmas Present, and now I am extremely embarrased!"
3,Not as safe as it looks.,I have been using this can opener for awhile and although it is fairly novel there are a few problems. It doesn't open all cans on the first try. I usually have to go two or three times around especially coffee cans. Second it will leave small metal slivers which I discovered when I got one embedded in my finger. I am going to replace it with a regular can opener.
2,Hamilton Beach 76600 can opener,"The first one purchased worked well for a while, it died, so I bought a second one..it was over priced and turned out to be a better paper weight so I bought an underthecounter can opener which was a better choice for me. Harvey Bragg"
1,Can opener with some problems,I have had my can opener for a while now. I am going to get rid of it. It leaves metal shavings if you don't get the can opened on the first try.
1,Does Not Do The Job,"The product looks nice, but there are many cans that the can opener simply does not open. Many times you have to run the can opener around the can a second time. I am going to buy another can opener, and this time it will be the regular ""sharp edge"" type."
4,The added safety is well worth the higher price,"Having chopped about a million vegetables without a nick, I find it ironic that I'd end up slashing my hand on a can lid. This product is well worth the extra money to avoid those sharp lids. Plus, you don't have to worry about fishing around for the lid, because this opener doesn't drop it into the can. If you have kids who sometimes prepare soup by themselves, or for people who might not see the edge of the lid as well as they used to, I'm sure this product will pay for itself with the money you save on band-aids."
5,"Great Price, Bad Enterface","The Gigabeat is an awesome mp3 player for the price. 20 gigs for $200 is not bad. The program that comes along is akward and confusing to use, but you can use windows media player or my computer to manage the song. The guide for the player is terrible written, it took me 2 days to figure how to get to the main menu to pick a different (hint, press the power button once and it pulls it up). If you use random the songs take a while to pull up sometimes. The earbuds that come with it are ok, but they sit farther out ear, so not as noisy as the iPod. If you are use to the iPod it may take a while to get use to. It is a great buy, and it has serveral ways to charge the mp3 which is neat. I personally feel like it is less likely to get stolen than an iPod. good price, guy it!!!!"
5,Customer Service,I give this company 5 stars for their excellent customer service. The product I recieved did not hold its charge and digideals was extremely prompt and professional in the way they handled and responded to my concerns. Their customer service representatives very responsive and helpful and issued a full refund.
2,Buy the ipod instead,"This item seems like a nice alternative to the ipod but it's not. It's basically just a copy of the ipod. The controls are very hard to use and it takes a while to learn all of its ins and outs. The software is okay. Itunes is much easier. So bottom line if you're thinking of buying the gigabeat don't, get an ipod. they cost the same."
3,review,"very godd item, but dosent work for infantt car seat, bcuase is bigger than de car seat, maybe need cut the elastic,tanks any way"
3,A Selected History,"The title is over the top but what the hell. I've heard a lot of complaints about this collection, especially concerning the quality and the bands that are missing. But, on the plus side, there are a lot of bands contained on this collection. If you are an old punk then it will be good to remember a lot of bands you had forgotten. Even the stuff you didn't like! If you were not around at the time then you get a good picture of what it was all about, not just the highlights. The company obviously could not afford to buy the rights to everything so they have had to rely on some dodgy bootleg live stuff - but that adds rather than detracts from the charm (if charm is the word)."
3,A misleading title,"The title, or a subtitle, needs to make it clear that this book concentrates on blue china with an American connection.People who are looking for a book on blue china with an Americian connection do not know that here is a book just waiting for them.Those who buy this book thinking it's a general book on blue china, may feel ripped off."
5,The Edith Doll and her Bear friends are really alive!?!?,"This is just one of ten stories in the Edith series that never ceased to amaze me as a child. The practical side of me knew they were just toys but...how come this ""toy"" could shut her painted on eyes?...how could this ""toy"" hold a thermometer in her painted mouth?...and, most of all, how could this ""toy"" cause me to love her and her bear friends so very much? Every title in the Lonely Doll series is a priceless treasure. Thank you Dare Wright. I will treasure you and your little charges forever in my heart. When I asked the author once, ""They really are alive, aren't they?"", Ms. Wright said, ""Well, you've found us out, haven't you."" Read these books and find out for yourselves!"
3,If I had a Hammer..,"The ""device"" to take the kids into t he world of myth makes the story almost believable, and the open look of the page and easy to read text will make this an easy reading adventure for fifth graders who need to build reading stamina."
1,Made in China NOT Germany,"This Weems & Plath Endurance Collection 085 Quartz Clock is made in China. It uses a hard to find type ""N"" battery."
2,It a little short on definitions,"As expected, this book does have many Gaelic names. But I was disappointed because it had very few definitions of the names. It does tell you if a name is popular with a particular family, but that's about it."
2,Not so good.,"It seemed to work for a couple of days, but then the geese just seemed to ignore it even after reapplications."
3,One cracked within a month,"These seem very durable at first but my large bowl cracked within a month of use. The other two are just fine and I use them a lot. Not sure what the problem was, I don't put them in the dishwasher. If it hadn't have cracked I'd have given these 5 stars since they are a staple item in my food prep."
1,Sorry hipppie product as should have known,"The bee caps work just as expected... You get what you pay for. If you believe they work, your body will think it has an enhancement. It's really just another TREE HUGGER product that hippies like to think works. On the same playing field with Al Gore and the global warming... all B.S."
1,Cookie Cutter Book - NOT one I recommend,"I bought this book in the hope that it could help a pet Bernese puppy buyer with good information.When reading this book, I felt as if the writer just 'filled in the blanks' of some generic puppy buyer information. This book did not deliver anything I'd hoped for. I consider this book to be a waste of my money and time investment.I feel there is a much better pet puppy buyer book on the market by Julia Crawford (a longtime Bernese breeder and prior BMDCA President) and the cost is about the same. This better book is called ""Bernese Mountain Dog: An Owners Guide to a Happy, Healthy Pet"".I was very disappointed in this book by Amy Christensen. And I hope she'll try again and do a better job next time."
2,low price and low quality,"I would not buy any PNI brand after owning this one for over a year. I have the same problem several other have in that it has continuous false alarms until unit is warmed up. It then seems to be too sensitive, but it does pick up radar at a respectible distance. The compass works (if calibrated per instructions), but distracts your attention due to flashing and moving. It's a neat feature for about a day, then you would rather put tape over it. The power-on light went out after 3 months, so I guess my compass now represents my power-on. The dim function quit functioning at same time. Look to Beltronics for alternative."
3,"DVD Be DVD,please.....","I'm a 3rd Dan Taekwondo practitioner who uses yoga as an excellent adjunct to my study,and practise yoga at an intermediate level. While I LOVE the material and it's presentation in the discs, I must agree with the comments from ""Philadelphia"" regarding the lack of DVD chapters that would actually optimize the use of the vinyasas,especially the Energy cycle as it tracks through the day. I purchased the DVD because I figured the DVD version made such technologic options available-wrong! It's actually easier to use the VHS, as I can readily park the tape where I want to start the next session,instead of a total restart,as on DVD. While Rodney and his material rate 5 stars,the DVD issues drop it to 3 for me. Come out with REAL DVD, Living Arts, and I'll buy it..... hey, anybody out there know what the music used in the Centering section is from? I'm sure it's Peter Davison, but don't know which CD..... -pajcastle@axom.com"
5,Fantastic!,This DVD was purchased to replace the one my daughter had for years and lost. She was so happy to receive another copy as it is her very favourite Yoga routine! The DVD is in perfect condition. She is very pleased!
3,"Good practice, but slow...","I really like Rodney Yee as a video instructor, but this video was a bit slow. the movements were pretty basic and I would recommend it for beginners but not imtermediate yogis!"
4,second time around,"the size is what is great about this crock pot. i bought one several years ago, but it was damaged when borrowed. so this is the replacement. the cover and lid strap are also nice to have when taking food to a potluck or party."
4,Works great but was disappointed about the different design,"What can I say - Already had this particular Slow Cooker, it works great, used it all the time till the handles broke. Searched high and low for the exact design... Thought I found it on Amazon... ordered the item shown - only to get one with a different design on the outside. Still works just wanted the one that was shown as the picture."
3,Interesting read - but it covers familliar ground,"There is always the sense of the familiar when reading books dealing with the bloodline of Christ. The exposition of the real facts concerning the origin of Priory of Sion, as well as the exposure of errors of more recent revelations tend to make one leery of yet another book on this subject. This book provides a good read, and if you are not over fed with the story of the bloodline of Christ, it is interesting, if not quite believable.The story of the development of the Christian religion, as told in this book, is worth reading in any event. Having recently been reading more scholarly works on the Egyptian development of Judaism I found this book gives a good description of the subject.It is worth spending some time reading through in the library, if not buying for reading in your home."
2,Little new to learn,"Since the main tenet of the Priory of Scion as proposed in ""Holy Blood Holy Grail"" and novelized in ""The Da Vinci Code"" has been effectively discredited, I was intent on sticking to real proto-Christian scholarship like that of Bart Ehrman and Ahmed Osman, but since the authors indicated that they had a true Sang Real/Royal Blood descendant as a source implying an actual interview, I gave this book a chance. There is little detail from the interviews with ""Michael"" in which he was to ""verify some of [the authors] allegations"". He apparently did not provide the authors with any documentary evidence to support his claims. Instead the authors mostly tell us what other alternative authors got correct and incorrect, which only really amounts to more presumption and conjecture. I tried to find some means to correspond with the authors but they are as unavailable to us as their source. You can learn what these and other authors say about Rex Deus through Wikipedia.com."
4,"I like it, but left me wanting more","I like this book a lot, it was very informative and opened my eyes to some new things; but it left me wanting more. I feel like I didn't get the whole picture, nor really an understanding of what happened to the Rex Deus families, who they all were, and are they still practicing their believes and traditions today."
3,Truely a good read.,"Tim Wallace Murphy is a good author, I've found similar information written in other books. Evidently a lot of these authors agree that something is wrong with the history lessons we've been taught. The great COVERUP!!!"
2,price,"found this product in a local pet store for ALOT less than what I paid for it,,,,,wish I hadn't ordered it"
3,we have not received it yet!,I ordered this for my mother's birthday so she can continue to read-so far we have not received it. Ordered over a month ago??We are pretty sure what we are getting however-hope to see it soon :)
2,Still waiting......,"I have no doubt that my father will love receiving the large print of the Reader's Digest, however, he has failed to receive his first copy. My family and I love Reader's Digest but their customer service leaves alot to be desired.In the past, I have ordered and paid for Reader's Digest directly through their mailings. I hesitate to do this any longer because I have received multiple bills for the same subscription which I continued to receive LONG after I had paid them in full. I was (am) hopeful that purchasing the subscription through Amazon will side-step some of these concerns.I will let you know...............when we receive our first issue."
1,F-,F- is how I rate the Readers Digest review. I never requested and one year renewal! I am not going to pay for the one year auto renewal as I never authorized it!
5,Reader's Digest large print,My MOther is 90 years old (young); she loves reading Reader's Digest cover to cover in the large print. this is one of her Christmas presets every year because I know it brings joy to her all year long...and if it brings her joy I love it!! I got mine through Amazon for a great price. A perfect gift for those who like to read and like a larger print. (Reader's digest large print (1-year subscription)
5,Blues: Live - and with Feeling,"Turn this one up when your friends come over. Excellent blues and a sweet voice. Even better, go see the Duke in person. Blues that doesn't sound like every other blues band."
2,Not a good test prep,"I used this book diligently over the course of a month to prepare for the verbal section of the GRE, but found that I was totally unprepared for taking the test. I do not recommend purchasing it for preparation. Instead look to the Princeton review. It's also a little cheaper for poor college students."
3,It is a good book.,"The book is good for the test preparation, though this used book has many permanent writings in it. Anyway it is useful. The shipping is fast."
2,Not so great,"I went through and I read the whole book, took all the practice tests, and even learned all of the words. Come test day none of the words were even on my GRE and I had been so worried about following the book that I think I may have done better without it. The book was good in improving my vocabulary, however, don't expect it to help you out a whole lot."
4,BALLET WITH TRUDIE & JAMES DASILVA,"This is a well-produced ballet DVD with Trudie Styler and instructor James DaSilva. The Bonus Features are not to be missed! Catching a peek at Sting & Trudie's Italian estate and their eco-farming is inspirational. Now onto the 25 minute Barre Routine: compared to using the chairs, this is such a pretty routine to watch that is. Watching ballet with Trudie & James did not seem intimidating. On the other hand, I worked out with The Chair Routine (25 minutes) and even though you do the same exact routine as the Barre, I found it challenging when the moves were in vertical direction and the pace was quicker. James was calling out positions fast ""passe, chasse, arabesque, tendu"". This is why I felt pretty winded both mentally and physically. So, get familiar with the ballet terms and positions for the feet AND arms in the Footwork Tutorial. If you had some ballet, it would be helpful."
5,In love,"I absolutely LOVE this dvd. I have several done by Trudie and her trainer, and this is probably my #1.I have asthma, and doing cardio has always been really difficult for me because of it. This gives me just the right amount of cardio.And I feel a difference the next day! I actually only do this dvd when I am off the next day or two because my legs are so sore after... but its that good kind of sore!"
3,"Really short, quick and irritating","I bought this video because I really enjoy ballet and ballet inpsired workouts, but I have yet to actually do this workout. I watched once through to get an idea and haven't touched it since. The pacing seemed really fast to me, and frankly, the non-stop voice over is really annoying. There's hardly a moment when the narrator isn't talking. The camera jumps around quite a bit and focuses more on Trudi's personal trainer than on her, which makes it hard to get a good idea of exactly what they're doing at a level of someone who is not a professional fitness guru. The video was fairly short- the first section with the barre is simply repeated with chairs in the other section.The biggest thing for me is the voice over and jumping camera. I know people have complained about the narration on NYCBallet's workout, but I'd rather have the unobtrusive seemingly out of place narrator from that workout than the overbearing one on this DVD."
3,"Not bad, not great","PROS: I actually did work up a sweat. It is fast paced and will probably take you a few times to keep up with the pace and flow. I'm not too terribly sore today, but since it was my first time I may not have been giving it my all as I was trying to keep up with the video instead of focusing on my technique.CONS: I was dissappointed that Trudie Styler wasn't actually doing the exercises. If your face is on the cover, you should probably participate in the excercises or else I don't really buy your endorsement. I also found the narrators voice to be a bit goofy and annoying. It just wasn't what I expected but I will still use it from time to time. However, I think I'll try one of the other ballet workout dvds."
2,giant buddha on the set,"I did not like this workout. It goes too fast and also, visually, I'm not sure why it is necessary to have the instructor doing ballet in front of a big Buddha statue the whole time. I find it distracting and annoying. I am a Christian but I would find it equally odd if there was a giant cross sitting behind the workout instructor. For me it comes off as a religious promotion and is intrusive to me. In fact, I have seen other workout videos by Gaiam productions and this seems to be the case in at least 2 other videos. I understand that they produce a lot of yoga videos and they use these types of symbols, but something about it bothers me. I don't like it and am returning it and will not buy any other of their products for that reason."
3,Media Arabic,"I was excited to receive this book, however as other reviews have said, it is difficult to use as a reference. The words in the book are very useful, relevant, and translated accurately, but are not in a particular alphabetical order that I can tell. I suppose I will use it as a vocabulary list, and just memorize them in order, but I was hoping to use it as a quick reference while reading the news."
2,Just a list of vocab words.,"Not a useful tool for learning media arabic. It's really just a list of common words found in arabic media. It would be more useful if they used the words in stories, so you could practice your comprehension. If that's what you're looking for, I'd highly recommend Media Arabic, by Alaa Elgibali and Nevenka Korica. It has the vocab broken down into sections, such as Summits and Meetings, and Demonstrations."
3,Good Resource,"This is certainly a good resource for getting to know Arabic media terms. It contains lists of relevant words broken into sections - general, politics, elections, military, economics, trade & industry, law & order, and disaster & aid.The problem with this book lies in the fact that the lists are not alphabetized by Arabic roots - or even alphabetized in English for that matter, they're seemingly just randomly sorted. I was hoping this book would help me in reading Arabic newspaper articles, but it ended up being quicker and easier for me just to pull out my Hans-Wehr dictionary for the answer than to search through the entire book for every single word.Mostly it seems this book would be a help in writing Arabic when you're searching for the correct word to use for the idea you're trying to express in English."
1,Extremely unorganized.,"This book was disappointing. It is extremely unorganized and difficult to use - in fact, I never use it. There is absolutely no organizational method applied to it. It's just a random combination of media words. If it were at least organized alphabetically, you could look up words."
2,Many useful terms but NO way to reference them.......,This book really needs instead to be web-based or on a CD and have a search field where the user can type in English or Arabic word/words and get any matching results. To remain in print in hard copy it would need many alphabetically arranged sections to be useful. There's just no way to look anything up. I have found the short glossaries in the back of other media Arabic textbooks to be far more helpful.
2,Disappointing,"Like most resources for those of us learning Arabic, this is disappointing. Others have already pointed out the lack of an alphabetized list of the words (preferably both in English and Arabic), but it's worth repeating since that lack makes the book too hard to use. Also, I noticed that on pp. 41-42, where words for various political situations and problems are listed, the book contains the word ""hesitation"" but not the word ""crisis."" That's a strange decision."
3,needs index or to be alphabetized,"While this book is extremely desirable for the vocabulary alone, it would be much better if it was arranged in alphabetical order, or had an index. I bought this book to help me translate news articles. I had to make my own index in order to use this for translation."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing because it is more like a 1000 word dictionary. I was expecting more phrases and terms difficult to look up in a standard dictionary. It has many words like malik(king), malika(queen) which an average person knows already and even if not can easily look up in a dictionary.It is still however useful for a beginner as a quick reference. The book could have been improved by adding flashcards and listing the words alphabetically. A fair price would have been around $5 to $6."
5,Excellent Tool for understanding to creation of Canon,"This wonderfully written book is not a history of the formation of the canon nor is it a justification for the Catholic or Protestant Canon. The author doesn't try to justify any one position. This book deals with many difficult questions, but at the same time, he answers in a manner that allows you to come to your own conclusions. For example, Why are there two version of the Old Testament? Is the Canon infallible? What does and did Gods inspiration mean? Why can so many people read the Bible and come up with so many different doctrines? These questions are tackled in the manner that provides a tool rather than a simplistic answer. It was the ""Rule if Faith."" The author explains the role that the ""Rule of Faith"" played in the development of the Canon and its interpretation. I great book, easy to read, well written."
4,"The Bible, the Church, and Authority: The Canon of the Christian Bible in History and Theology","An enthralling read. Being a novice at learning the origins of Christianity and First Century Christianity, I was most impressed with the ease at which Father Lienhard explained the issues faced by the Early Church Fathers and the later Reformationists. I was drawn to the book like a magnet. Father Lienhard does not write preferentially for one faith or the other. He gives you facts as they were (and are) and lets you form your own conclusions. I am totally satisfied with this book."
5,FANtastic shirt!,"There is no better way to watch a Denver Bronco game than wearing the jersey of the man who kicked the team to victory in the last seconds of the games! Great jersey, worth every cent. Thank you."
2,too big and heavy for me,"They seem like nice earrings, very glossy and modern, but I'm not comfortable wearing them. The circle on these earrings is almost as big as a dime, but much heavier. I thought I was buying something less chunky; my taste is for smaller earrings. I wish Amazon would publish size measurements."
1,This is a terrible storyline,Richard Roundtree's character isn't even named Shaft.He is actaully named Archie.This is a story about a jewel-thief released from prison / trying to do the right thing. A person would think by the title 'Shaft' that it would be as good as the trilogy;this isn't the case. Put your blaxploitation spending cash back in your wallet and walk away. This is garbage and chances are your vcr will break in the process.
2,Total cheese!!!,"Who wrote this script? What a terrible way to end the Shaft dynasty.In one of the scenes Ninjas are on on top of huge boulders shooting arrows at Shaft. Shaft manages to catch one of the arrows and throws it back at the Ninja, fatally killing him. Can you believe that? The Batman television series has better actions scenes. I've seen better acting in Fast Actin' Tinactin!Do yourself a favor and buy a Dirty Harry movie in lieu of Diamond Shaft."
2,Sexy Apron!!!!!!!!!!,hahaha...if THIS is a dress then I'm...nevermind! The two stars are for the packaging and the quality of the item...because it WAS packed well and IT is pretty...HOWEVER IT IS NOT A DRESS!!!!!!!!!!! If ANYTHING IT IS A PRETTY SEXY APRON!!!!!!!!!!How many dresses have you bought that don't cover your behind? Because ALL that's in the back are three strings tied 1. around your neck 2. around your back and 3. around your behind! THAT's it! No more coverage!Soooooooooo don't waste your money on this! It's simply shocking! And not how you wish it was either!!!!!!!!! :-<
2,Cheap,"It ripped along one seam after the second time we used it. I am still using it but now it gaps where it is ripped and part of the stroller gets wet. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy a more expensive one."
1,"Not worth it, buy something better",I bought it for my Kolcraft Contours II stroller because it was the only one that would fit. It did fit the stroller but it tore along the seam the same day we bought it and now it doesn't attach at the bottom. The material is very cheap. Just not worth it.
3,"Does what it needs to, but...","It does cover the stroller and keeps the rain out, more or less. But it came out the package with a four-inch rip on one of the seams. The quality/thickness of plastic is such that unless it's treated fairly carefully, it's going to be prone to more tears along the seams."
5,"arashi""s time","i loved all the songs . wish it had came with english lyrics so i""d know what they were singing ,but love it anyways."
1,Window visors,This item was received in a taped box and the items had been opened inside. They were marked and were missing parts. The directions were also missing. As a result the box was returned to Amazon as which time my money was refunded which I appreciate. The item was the worst one that I have ever received and hopefully noone else has the same problem. Thank you
4,Not too shabby,"It fits my 2004 model escape. The only reason why it lost one star was because the rear passenger windows aren't completely covered. When you roll them down, the top of the window will be protected but the slanted part will be exposed. Overall good product.As we all know, researching an item prior to online buying is key to satisfactory service. Google ""EGR 573341 Escape"" and you'll notice the product is for 2001-2007 models."
1,Not like the PBS TV show,"This book was very disappointing. The characters and the storyline are very different from the usual TV show on PBS. Caillou misbehaves and although he is reprimanded, it could be confusing to a small child. I ended up skipping those pages when I read it to my daughter."
1,Not the kind of ideas I want to give my child.,"In this book, Caillou models all kinds of acting-out behavior. Although it may be dealt with effectively, I feel it will put the wrong kinds of ideas in my child's head about behaviors. While the feelings Caillou tries to express are definitely valid and normal, I don't think I need to give her any ideas about biting or hitting."
1,A book full of bad ideas,"I bought this book for my daughter who loves Caillou. It's a terrible book filled with so much bad behavior, I'd like to throw it away. Caillou bites the new baby! Not a book to read to an impressionable sibling--especially one who loves to be like Caillou."
3,Not a good example. . .,"I bought this book for my son right before his sister was born but the little boy in the book talks about hurting his sister and I think that is a very bad example. The idea is good though, for talking to a toddler about having a sibling."
1,Pure Disappointment,"I was very disappointed and shocked when I first read this book. My jaw literally dropped.Caillou is portrayed as a very naughty child who regresses in development and displays poor behavior after his sister is born. He wets his bed, wants to drink from a bottle, bites his sister, and throws a doll against the wall that happens to look just like Rosie. I find this book very inappropriate to read to a young child; and I am saddened to see Caillou portrayed this way; especially knowing how much my daughter adores him."
5,Great product!,"Not only is this a very sturdy product, it is prettyingenius too. Holds plenty of both food and waterand is very packable because of the shape. I highlyrecommend it for people who love to travel with theirdog."
4,Lost History Recovered,"Mary Lyons has added a gem to African-American history by giving us the forgotten story of Harriet Powers and reminds us of the importance of both artisanship and storytelling for a culture. She has written it in such a way that children can appreciate the hardships endured by those who have gone before, and makes us all want to go to the Smithsonian or the Museum of Fine Arts Boston to see Powers' quilts!"
3,Could be better...,"I started reading this book and the topics didn't seem to me that advanced. Also, I had to debug every code example in the book so far just to get them to run which I guess is a learning experience in itself. I guess I just wasn't that impressed."
4,Nice Costume But It's No Size 10,"This costume is in no way ""up to size 10."" In fact, I'd say it's closer to a size 6 and a small 6 at that. My hips measure 35"" and though the sheath dress goes over there's not much, if any room, to spare.The costume is very well made, sexy but covers you nicely. Great movement with all the fringe! The side zip is a bonus to help you get into and out of the dress, totally unexpected for a costume. The shoulder straps are a bit on the flimsy side but can be reinforced easily enough. The feather on the headdress is adequate but only one side of the headband is glittery with the back being plain black elastic.Can't wait to see how it holds up through a night out."
4,Great costume!,"Everyone loved this costume. It was sexy, without being over the top. It was well made and held up well through a night of dancing and fun."
2,"Flimsy, flimsy....but nice handle","I bought this to replace a cheap one from [name of store] that had finally given up, and does not come close to matching the quality. It is way too flimsy and needs about another 1/2"" in diameter to cover my 12"" pans. Save your money and go get one at your local store."
2,It's not 12 inches,"This item is actually 11 and 3/8 inches in diameter, not 12 inches. Measure your frying pan before you order this!"
1,A big disappointment,"The doggie dooley is NOT good for the sandy soil of New Jersey which percolates very quickly and the dooley needs to hold water and the ""stuff the bacteria is working on"" until it can seep into the ground, below. Sandy soil does not work like that and because of this, the dooley was just plain a waste of money, labor and time. The company should have given a warning. It also says that it should work for 4 dogs. Well, the size of the dogs should be considered. I have 3 labs and the dooley may work for 4 cocker spaniels."
3,The Soil is the Key,"I have had this product twice. The first time I had one I had really nice ""dirt"" that it was installed in. The unit was able to retain the water long enough to digest quickly. This was in Florida and even the HOT summer did not smell. I recently moved and decided to get another unit. This one has not worked at all and I would say it has to do with the soil. I now live in an area where the soil is very sandy and fine. I will fill up the water level and it is gone in less then an hour. Even the rainy season didn't help. The Doggie Dooley is now totally full of dog droppings and I can no longer use it. Also the ""step-on"" lid broke (a rivet popped) before I even finished the install. I have not been able to figure out any way for it to hold the water longer which would help."
4,Different from other Silhouette books I've read,"I found the plot of the king's ""bodyguard"" in love with the king's sister-in-law to be interesting. While trying to remain loyal to Jacob von Austerand, Thomas, his ""bodyguard"" is falling in love with Diane Fields, a recent divorcee from New England. He knows that to fall in love with the woman would be committing treason.... I really enjoyed this and would recommend it for those who are looking for something a little different from the norm."
5,Looking for this CD,"I love Pepe Jaramillo's music and have other albums from him. This is a really great CD and I would like to buy it, but cannot locate it. Anyone have one they want to sell?"
4,Well written reference primer,"This is a first edition book on the .net platform's foundation Xml libraries. It was written more than five years ago, but still remains an excellent resource to anyone trying to get a handle on all those angle brackets (especially if you've just been thrown at a project with minimal exposure to Xml, and you think that learning LINQ sounds like wayyy too much work. Not that such a thing would ever happen in the software development world, of course). Bornstein's writing is quick and engaging, and most importantly: helpful.That being said, it is an older book, pre-dating even .net 2.0, so some of what is discussed is depricated material. Perhaps surprisingly, quite a bit of the material is still relevant in this modern .net 3.5 (soon 4.0) / Silverlight era.I wish there was a second edition, so I could give five stars."
1,Playboy-Voluptuous Vixens,Eventhough some of the exhibitors are well endowed. There was not enough action in the way erotism between a man and a woman. The highlight of the film is Pandora Peaks.
4,great tunes,"This album was produced by Jack Endino. For those of you who don't know, Jack produced Bleach (Nirvana) and just about every successfull seattle band to date. And now he has added UsOfAll to the list. This band is not concerned with trendoids or rapsters or dj wana be's, they are straigh up good rock. They have a beatlesque pop sound intermingled with a heavier darker rage and know when to use their different colors to move the grove and tell their story. They arn't pretending to be rock stars and haven't bothered with usless attitudes. Kinda refreshing. While there are a few songs that leave you wondering the album still stands on its own as a good peice of composition and is definitly entertaining for hours of play. I must mention as well the lyrics of Michelle and John. Poinent words of dissatisfaction of the ignorance we pretend to ignore and the agrivation of being human and knowing it. And they're great live, check 'em out!"
5,Worth Every Penny,"Great, dependable radios for in the neighborhood and around the home. The transaction went smooth - the radios shipped quickly and arrived prior to the estimated delivery date. I have operated the radios for a year now without any issues."
4,Creek Pacey-Joey Fan,"ok...i love season 3 beacuse i am a die hard Pacey-Joey fan and this is my favorite season out of all six of them and because its when pacey and joey fall in love! the only thing i dont like is that they didnt keep the original music because it was *amazing* music. my favorite episode on this dvd is either the anti-prom or true love...they are both amazing, but almost every episode is good. buy this dvd!"
5,Dont hate,"Season three is by far one of the best seasons of Dawson's Creek. In Season three we went through this amazing journey! You get to hold your breathe and cross your fingers in hopes that pacey will win the girl. You get to experience this love that blossoms. It isn't like season one, which was drawn out. We got the point about the one sided love. After season two, face it, it was tiring seeing the friend, lover, friend, lover, friend, so on and so on. Pacey and Joey were fresh. They were real. How many real relationships are like joey and dawson? none that I know of. But I know alot of relationship that start with joey and pacey.SEASON THREE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Theme song gone,"I must say that it was a total disappointment to hear jann arden singing in the opening credits of the season three DVD. I am always anticipating the strong voice of Paula Cole singing ""I don't want to wait"", because for someone like me, who is a huge fan, that song is sonomous with the show. I was totally disappointed with the music change, and hope that it goes back to the way it is meant to be for the season four DVD.Otherwise the show is always great to watch, however, the producers need to get with the program, and make the DVD's the way people want to see them!!!"
2,Why Why Why...,I just put in the first disc of Dawson's Creek season 3. First episode comes on. Intro--I am absolutely dumbfounded when the intro music comes on. What in blue hell? I was even more shocked when the music was changed to all my favorite scenes. I still can't believe it.
3,The theme song is the original....,"Just so you all know, the song played over the season three DVD is the original song used in the pilot and the international releases for Dawson's Creek.It's kinda weird hearin it again (after all, us in the uk only got it for one season and then it was back to Paula Cole) but really it shouldn't matter."
5,Grow up.,"To all of you moaning and complaining about the songs, etc. in the season - get a grip. No one is purchasing the season to listen to the music. Get real. Pissed off that only 5 copies have been sold via Amazon? Most people take the smart route, and head to their local Wal-Mart or video store to purchase DVD's. Plus, it's only the first day it's released.Instead of worrying about incidentals, why not enjoy the last season and get over yourselves?"
3,I can't believe this is happening again!,"Think the powers-that-be would've learned their lesson last time around? Sadly, no. Mr. Stupin: I bought FOUR copies of Season One for friends and family. Due to the music replacement--which I found out about after purchasing the DVD's--I only bought ONE copy of Season Two, and then tuned my recorder back to TBS. I have to say that I'm honestly not sure if I'm going to bother with this one (so you do the math).I was really looking forward to the release of Season Three on DVD. There are so many episodes I am fond of: ""Escape from Witch Mountain"", ""Four to Tango"", ""A Weekend in the Country"", ""Northern Lights"", ""Crime and Punishment"", ""Stolen Kisses"", ""The Longest Day,"" ""The Anti-Prom"", ""True Love""... It kills me that they've butchered this series--again. Frankly, I'd rather deal with the commercials on television.(Rated 3 stars out of deference to Katie and Josh. The music loss merits a big fat ZERO.)"
2,BRING BACK THE MUSIC!,"The quality of the season is not my focus of a review. The fact that the studio/producers chose to take out music that drove each show and replace it with music we've never heard of and not even of that time on radio, is a shame for fans of the show. Especially the replacement of the title song. I understand needing to save money but music is one of the key reasons this show swept us away. It's a shame that the producers/studio chose business over loyal fans who would pay good money for every season's dvd."
5,By far the show's best season!,"...and here it is at last! The best season of one of the most addictive shows of our time. Season 1 was just a prelude. Season 2 was even better, and it introduced us to Andie and Jack - two terrific characters. But season 3 is where Dawson's Creek really begins to fly. The ensemble of actors have perfected how to pitch their performances, and the recurring neuroses of the early seasons give way to more gripping and more truthful insights into each of their lives.Beyond season 3, things start to go slightly downhill, with an increasing number of ""filler"" episodes. (Anyone remember the episode which was basically an advert for a No Doubt album?!!) Thankfully the producers gave the show a glorious send-off at the end of season 6... but this box set really does represent Dawson's Creek back in its prime.If you're on the verge of buying, don't hesitate a second longer."
1,Season Three Sans Music,"I gave this DVD one star because I loved the third season of Dawson's Creek. Loved it. However, this DVD seriously disappoints. The most obvious problem is the new theme song, which is not ""creative"" at all, but a cop-out. And for a price comparable with other television series DVDs that managed to maintain their music, it strikes me as unnecessarily cheap. Many of the scenes where songs were pivotal to the plot have been made shallow by the cookie cutter replacement music that the DVD has the nerve to bill as a ""special feature."" Particularly crass is the weblink to the site that sells the replacement songs as a new DC soundtrack. And the commentary has nearly nothing to do with the episodes they cover. Kerr Smith and Paul Stupin spend time discussing his direction of an episode in a later season and his appearances in movies. Save your money and tape the syndicated run on TBS. They still have the original theme song and soundtrack."
4,1 Theam Song Short of 5 stars,"This DVD is definatly worth the money, especialy if you are an abbid DC fan like I am. Season 3 is one out the best seasons out of the 6, this is whear all of the drama and tention between the characters begins to unfold starting with the unusual behavior of newly changed Dawson after meating the very ""outgoing"" Eve. This starts a new relationship between Joey and Pacey and everything just gets ugly from there. The only disapointing aspect of this DVD is the total change in Music through the season including the theam song, this might not have been the best Idea, all the original songs were matched perfictly with every emotion and seen, also in the Boat race episode they replace the very fitting Megadeth song ""Crush em'"" with a song that dosent even relate to the seen, and that is why I could only give 4 out of 5 stars. Other than that this is a great DVD and I highly recommend it!!! Season 4,5&6 will be even better I'm sure, I can't wait!!"
3,Disappointing!!,"Along with almost everyone else, I was extremely upset that they went and changed the theme song. The shows themselves are great. But, after being upset about the theme, you can't really enjoy them.I just hope that the powers that be will realize how much they screwed up and correct this in Season 4. Because, if I don't hear ""I Will Remember You"" in the episode where Andie says good-bye, I will be forced to do something drastic!!"
3,not great,shipping was good but product not so good. One of the DVDs was so damaged it wouldn't play
1,worthless,"I must say I am stunned how many positive reviews this dvd got after the music changes were released. There is a reason this dvd is only $32. If your smart you will save your money and get 7th heaven this sept. 14th, but hey, if you want to buy a cheap, remixed, no extras, low quality (23 episodes on 4 discs) DVD, be my guest. I guess there are a lot more 14 year olds out there than I thought."
2,Dawson's Creek is boring but............,I just started watchin Dawson's creek and just finished Season 3 and it is a very boring show. It lags and the storylines r not even interesting. This season is probably good because of the whole Joey/Pacey love affair but before this season it is BBBBOOOORRRRIIIINNNNGGGG. Jen fall in loves wid Henry Parker played by a hottie actor name Michael Pitt. He chases Jen throughout the season and finally Jen falls for him in a very sweet way and den wrote him off. The writers on the show didn't do a good job !! I'm acutally very disappointed dis show sucks. Michael Pitt is HOT!
5,Pacey's Season,"Like it's been pointed out before, the new relationship between Pacey and Joey was a risk that totally paid off. I also was not a frequent DC watcher until I happened to channel surf into their first road-side kiss. I knew enough of the show to know that that kiss was going to be a huge deal. I got so caught up in the story and was not able to miss a single episode since! Joshua Jackson is an incredible actor, and he was able to portray the pain, happiness, and insecurities that came from starting a relationship with a girl who not only seemed out of his league, but was also considered the ""soulmate"" of his best friend. I can't wait till season four where they become one of the most believable TV couples ever. My favorite line: ""Permission to come aboard?"" I certainly did!"
5,Best of the Best!,"This is the season I have been waiting for!! The build up for the PJ love story was the best romance on this show. It was so good, in fact, that even though they tried to ignore it in later seasons, they could not. I see it's the best selling so far of the first three seasons, no surprise there."
3,Sucks,"It sucks, they took out the ""i don't wanna wait"" song. It doesn't feel the same. What a shame!!!!!!!!!!!I hope they put back the song the next season in dvd."
2,One of The biggest disappointments in DVD history!,"Oh creative changes...You Executive producers, ruined the greatest Dawson's Creek season by changing the theme songs, and the meaningful and important songs to most of the meaningful scenes!! As a fan of Dawson's creek..I would like my money back!! Executive producers know nothing about how the music made the drama unfold..The NEW music is CRAP!!! in fact I'm going to tell people not to purchase this DVD, and just go and find the original VHS cassettes somewhere else on the internet.. The last episode is kinda meaningless now because of the music... good job jackasses!If it weren't for a great season like this , I wouldn't have gave it 2 stars..Thank you executive producers for ruining a great season and great romance..DJ Mane 1"
2,WHY WHY WHY,"Okay, I was willing to overlook the music changes this time around, because I really enjoyed this show, and I grew up with this school. For better or for worse, Dawson's Creek will always remain in the back of my brain. Season 3 has alwasy been my favorite, but when i heard that they music changes where so drastic that the theme song is being replaced, I had to put my foot down!!!Columbia why would you do this, or better yet, how could you? Don't you know that fans would rather have a MSRP of $80 or so for an additional disc (to lower compression) and to make ***MOST*** of the song???I can't in good conscience recamend a DVD with the WRONG THEME SONG... Two stars is because I could never give DAwson a 1."
3,Best Season of Dawson's Creek,"Season 3 is the best season of Dawson's Creek by far. Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes have so much chemistry it makes the storyline between Joey and Pacey so much more believable than that between Joey and Dawson. Although I'm also a fan of season 4, it's not as good as season 3 because of Pacey and Joey's constant fighting.They should have found a way to keep the same music that the original broadcast had however. The music is what brings a lot of emotion to the episodes and some of the emotion does go when the music isn't the same."
5,2nd Best Season Ever!!!!,"I first saw Dawson's Creek during Spring break 2002. I saw the whole first season and i absoultly loved it! Because of school i couldnt watch the whole series, but when i heard that the seried finalle was gonna be on i HAD to watch it. That was the day i became obsessed with Dawson's Creek. I have the first and second season and the last episode on dvd and i have already pre-ordered the third. My all time favorite season it the 2nd because im a HUGE Dawson and Joey fan!!!!! I love pacey dont get me wrong but i love Dawson like 100 times more. I like the third season becasue this is where the big Dawson, Joey, Pacey love triangle starts! Just Buy it now!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED."
3,MUSIC! MUSIC! MUSIC!,"Simply put...great season, bad dvd set.I realize it may be stupid to attack a collection of great episodes over something as trivial as the accompanying music, but the music was an important part of show. It was important to all the WB shows. That original music was a part of the original show. The show that we as fans love so much. To change the music somehow changes the show. Its not the same. Sure the narrative is just as potent, but it feels different. And different isn't necessarily better. And this is made the most clear with the changing of the theme song. Personally, Paula Cole's song made me want to puke whenever I'd here it, but it just fit wonderfully with the title sequence. To see and hear a different song over that sequence...well, it was just wrong! Cheap! So please!!! Producers of the show, those responsible for these dvd sets, if nothing else please put the original theme song back in with Season 4! Listen to your fans."
3,Huge Fan - Please help out!,"Hello DC Fans!I just purchased season 4 today. And as I was browsing the net - I came across this review section. I almost read all 169 reviews - and most of them I concur with - the problem with the music. I am deeply disappointed with the replacement music and hope things have changed for the better for future DVD releases. But if they haven't - I would like to request from some of the die-hard fans to please research and post the Sony website - e-mail address or physical address so we can all voice our opinions on the reasons why we would like the original music put back into the episodes. I also agree with paying a little more money to have them do this! The music was so intertwined with the show, the characters and the emotions - that it feels like something is missing or just a little off with each episode!Hope to see any type of information in future reviews!Thanks everyone!!!DC forever!!!"
2,Great episodes - TERRIBLE COMMENTARY,"This season might still be my favorite episode of the whole series but I found the ""commentary"" on this particular season to be horrendous. People who purchase the Season 3 DVD DO NOT want to hear 30 minutes of commentary about Kerr Smith directing an episode in SEASON 5. Tell us about Season 3. Give us the behind the scenes scoop. Kevin Williamson does an excellent job with the Series Finale DVD and while Paul Stupin is ok when he joins Williamson for the finale he is PURE DISASTER on the Season 3 DVD. People who like Season 3 also generally like the Joey/Pacey storyline - another topic that is barely discussed throughout in the commentaries. Basically the ""extras"" were a complete disappointment to all true Season 3 fans. The episodes are still great in terms of the acting. The change in music is also disappointing. It's too bad, this DVD could have been great."
5,favorite season,"What can I say but I'm a sucker for Dawson's Creek and this is IMO by far the best season. I will say that the music change in the opening credits did throw me for a loop but I honestly don't care. Its the stories and the characters that you love. Why anyone would buy this DVD without already being an avid fan I have no idea and can't for the life of me imagine a true fan not wanting to own this season. Its the Creek, plain and simple.Anyone know when season four will be out?"
3,Still worth it,"The unknown, low production music is definitely distracting, and the wrong theme song makes me feel dizzy, but watching the Joey/Pissy relationship grow makes the set still worth buying. Definitely the best season.I would like to tell the producers though that I would have been happy to pay an additional $15-20 to have the right music."
3,Theme Song,"I own seasons 1-3 and the series finale, but I will NOT buy season four without the original theme song. Change it now, you cheap a-holes."
3,Stand-out season,"Unlike many reviewers, I wasn't a fan of this show from the very beginning. In fact, there was very little about this show that impressed me, originally. I've always felt that, as far as witty banter and pop-culture references go, Dawson's Creek failed where Gilmore Girls succeeded. However, one weekday afternoon I found myself watching the episode Cinderella Story out of sheer boredom, and was blind-sided by the ending. From then on, I was hooked by Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes' infectious chemistry. I decided to buy the Season 3 set because I wanted to watch this relationship develop from the beginning.My only complaint about this set is that the first two dvds skip maddeningly, and many episodes are completely unwatchable. Because of this, I gave this set three stars instead of four, for disappointing product quality. Hopefully, the set I received was just a lemon."
5,Great Season,"I know a lot of people diss on this season, but it was actually my favorite. Throughout the first two seasons I was totally rooting for Joey and Dawson and was torn up with the way that they broke up in the end of season 2. But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved watching Pacey fall in love with Joey and then how much chemistry they had together. I think this season also made Joey a more likeable character, because I think she was very easy to hate in the second season. Once I started watching the second half of season 3, I couldn't stop. If you like Dawson's Creek, I would reccommend buying this season!"
5,best season,ok i forgot one more thing which i saw after reading a review ... ya the music is changed in season 2 because they couldnt get the rights to all the music. but if ur totally into it as i am the original music is played during the episodes on tbs in the morning ... i already have season 3-6 taped but im getting them on dvd anyways
1,URGENT: Music Replacement that will change everything,"(...) Paula Cole's ""I Don't Want to Wait,"" the theme song to all seasons of the show has been replaced! I wasn't going to buy this set anyway but I thought that might change some of the minds of the people who are debating on buying this. I thought it was important for everyone to know"
5,Don't listen to these crazy people^!!,"Ok, anyone who gives this season a bad review are just biased because they are Dawson/Joey shippers!! Don't listen to them!! This is by far the best season in my opinion!! Followed by Season 2, you should really get that season too!!"
2,"Wow, this was impressively sucky!","Don't get me wrong, I loved the first two seasons of DC but the third was complete CRAP! I bought it with the knowledge I had of the first two sesons and figured it'd be good. Boy was I wrong! It really dropped in to the ridiculous category in this season. I got the chance to see the rest of the seasons (4,5&6) and they were just as bad. It's a shame really...It was so good but it just jumped the shark in the 3 season"
5,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G,"i compared this book with michael crichton's timeline and i have to say, this book rocks!!both books are about quantum physics but iles made it more interesting and easier to understand..the story line is just amazing, you keep living on eventhough you're actually dead..i guess that's the theme of today's technology; cheating deatheventhough the book was a bit long, iles has a way of writing that if you left out one single sentence, it's just plain unacceptable and you'll probably end up not understanding the whole story"
4,Big Brother has arrived,"Never being a fan of science fiction I was quite surprised. Greg Iles has never let me down so I read the book on his name not the title. It was a pleasant surprise, I am still not a trekie but I did enjoy the book. It is done in a matter that keeps you reading and not overpowers on the science side of the story. I did enjoy it but I personally will not venture deeper into the world of science fiction."
3,Not his best,"I'm a big fan of Greg Iles, however this was not his best effort.... The story was boring, the characters dull and it moved at a snails pace. ..., I was disappointed."
1,"Da Vinci Code , Please !!!!","The reason I picked this book up was due to the comparisons to the Da Vinci Code written on the cover. The Da Vinci Code is like an illuminated text compared to this book. Have you ever started reading a book wondering when something excited was going to happen? I was asking myself this by the time I got to page 100. The plot was paper thin, but worse, boring!! I gave this book one star for the premise, but idea that the main character was really Jesus, was ridiculous at best."
3,"Meta cognition, metaphysics, metamorphs","Footprints of God is a thriller for thinkers, revolving as it does around the universal mysteries about life, death, consciousness, God, and the nature of reality. Zig zagging rapidly from one crisis to another, it manages to hook you into the story line very early. Although some aspects of the plot lack originality (the psychiatrist/patient relationship and a series of impossible escapes, for instance), the techno-science here is eye-openingly credible, comprehensible, and, like most new advances, morally ambiguous and a bit frightening. Issues of faith and religion are evenly handled, devoid of preachiness and proselytizing. On the down side, characters are types (ruthless security agent, evil general, all-American president) rather than full-blown individuals, and the book is too long, leading to a rather silly end-of- the-world scenario. Nevertheless, Footprints is thought-provoking and exciting enough to keep the reader turning pages. 3 stars."
2,Strange,"Felt like Iles was trying to break into a different style -heavy on philosophy - felt like it got bogged down too much in this area, interesting premise but felt like it was work to get to the end of book - unlike many of his others. Hope he takes the machines out and goes back to a more personal touch in next work."
1,"It was Bad, REALLY BAD","It's not too often that I buy a book and fail to read it. I forced myself about 1/4 of the way through, then gave up. It was tedious & very lack-luster. Before I tossed it into the trash, I skimmed through parts at the end, and the ending itself. I don't want to present any spoilers here, but let's just say, I read enough at the beginning to realize that the ending was very lame indeed. This book was really bad. I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,The Footprints of God,"The Footprints of God: another good Greg Isles book, reading is a little slow sometimes but it is a otherwise good book"
4,"Not my usual genre, but I liked it","My sister just finished reading this book and left it at my house for me to read. Otherwise, I wouldn't have selected this book.It took me a little while to get into the story but then I was hooked. I think I might look for another Greg Iles book."
3,An Okay Book But Not Up To Par For Iles!,"Greg Iles is an author from who I've come to expect excellence. While The Footprints Of God is a fairly good book, it does not measure up to Iles' past perfomances. In typical Iles fashion, the book is well-written. However, the plot, while ambitious in scope, is too convoluted and takes too long too develop. I found myself losing interest in many passages and began to skim through these sections. Further, the characters in The Footprint Of God are not nearly as well-developed as in most of Iles' other books and are somewhat unbelievable. This book might have been more enjoyable had it been about 100 pages shorter. Iles has definitely redeemed himself in his latest book, Blood Memory, which I highly recommend."
2,not as good as his other books,This one just isn't as good as the rest. Iles is a great storyteller but this is not his best work.
1,This book made me wish I had brain cancer,"How bad can literature be? Just read this book and you'll find out. I can not believe that readers are giving this book positive reviews. This book is as thoughtless as it is superficial. A super computer is built, then it launches nuclear weapons on everything and everyone. Why? Because humanity is so bad it's not worth saving; boy, how ORIGINAL! The only reason this book is getting good reviews is because it's an easy read. The author dupes the less astute reader into thinking this story is good by writing a text that moves so fast one barely has time to think. Either that, or, the book was written with short text and small words because the author knew he was WASTING OUR TIME!"
1,This Book Was Terrible!,"This book was so poor, I am not even going to waste my time on a full review. The short of it is that the novel is sci-fi-ish, about a super computer that has mapped the human brain and can ""think"" on its own. The team behind the creation of the supercomputer, called Trinity, splinter; each man wanting to use it to their own plan. The main character, David, tries to get outside help and is marked for death himself.Then, the novel splits off onto this weird tangent where David begins seeing life through the eyes of Jesus Christ. The novel goes straight downhill from their.This book was just bizarre and I would not recommend it to anyone. Stay far away."
1,This was a Greg Iles book?,"I have always loved all the Greg Iles books I've read, but this one is pure dreck. It is sci-fi, new age, and anti-Biblical. What a waste of my time."
3,Words can't describe how bad,"This book had promise. It had an interesting premise. It started slow, but then picked up quite nicely beforing coming to a crashing halt toward the end. The climax of this book is actually a philosophical discussion between a man and a computer. Read that again. A tense situation is going on around them, but a 50 page philosophical discussion about the existence of God is the climax of this book. Anytime the tension or action starts, we switch back to the discussion and everything grinds to a halt.All in all, this book has to be one of the most uneven I've read in a long time. Avoid this one."
2,"entertaining, but pales next to COLOSSUS","This was a fast read. The final showdown was, however, eerily similar to that in ""Colossus: The Forbin Project,"" a 1970's movie which occasionally airs on cable. That movie, based on a novel by Dennis Feltham Jones, is a TRUE CLASSIC in this genre. This recent novel was less satisfying."
5,"Vision, humanity and a great love story.","I suspect the fellow who didn't think this book was worth his time was looking for something a little ligher. This book is a page turner. It has energy, depth, excitement and damn good drama. As a Virtual Human Designer, I know this subject and Greg did his research. It's not really a question of ""If"" this kind of virtual human will arise, but ""when"". This book really entertains you while it makes you think and introduces a cutting edge vision of the future."
1,Disappointing!,"I have been a fan of Greg Iles work for several years now and have enjoyed all his previous books to varying degrees. I was looking forward to this latest effort THE FOOTPRINTS OF GOD. However, I was destined to be disappointed! I found the story ridiculous and extremely boring. If you are new to Greg Iles, read one of his earlier books such as THE QUIET GAME instead of this one!"
2,fshrldy,"Greg Iles has been a favorite, but he falls very short here. Characters are shallow, plot is very contrived. The ""computer is taking over the world"" is pretty overdone and its tough to believe that the main character is GOD,A real disappointment"
2,Muddled,I am an avid reader of Greg Isles books but this novel was disappointing. I found the plot muddled and the characters flat. This was not up the normal standards of this very good author.
2,Another bad author,"There must be 40 ""My God""s spoken in this book. Characters are one-dimensional and similar and exposition so obvious that this might as well be a blueprint for bad writing. Characters explain everything in this book to keep the story moving along, with exchanges such as ""My God, you mean the computer is alive?"" ""Yes. And if it gains consciousness, then, well, My God."" Etc Etc."
5,Keep and open mind...,"The book grabbed me on the first page. I wont get into the plot much but rather the stand point it made with the philisophical and meta-physical ideals. It offers an interesting and unique aspect about the nature of the universe and ultimatly who and what ""God"" is. But it is by no means a religious book. Some Christians would be likely to call the idea blasphemous. Other than that the plot is interesting and nicely written. It involves a super computer that can rival man kinds intelligence and ultimatly holds the world hostage. I would reccomend it for people who seek knownledge and ideals about what I said at the beginning. If your not one of those people, its a good thriller full of action, suspense. Including an intense chase by the NSA."
3,Starts like a Ferrari; ends like a Chevy,"Greg Iles is a very gifted writer. As he has promised us, he will never write the same book twice. So one should expect a certain amount of unpredictability.The initial premise of creating an Artificial Intelligence computer based not on reverse engineering the brain, but by ""cloning"" the human mind into a machine is fascinating. The technology described does not seem far off, so the idea seems doable.I ran into problems (and I always run into problems with books that go this direction) when the main characters develop a ""God"" complex where they have mastered all knowledge and are all powerful. FOOTPRINTS reminds me of a 1970's movie where the computer takes over the world and no one knows how to stop the cybernetic creation. My eyes glaze over whenever a novel attempts to transcend the nature of man.That said, FOOTPRINTS is well written and it does keep you reading. I just didn't buy it after a while.You'll either like this one or hate it."
3,Greg Iles,Not as good as some of the other titles that I have read. Still he is an excellent writter and I will continue to buy his books.
1,Audio: 14 People Can't Be Wrong....,"I have to agree with the other 14 people on Amazon that this book is bad. I really like Greg Iles audios, but this one was a lemon that I am glad I only paid a dollar for. It is Iles attempt at science fiction and it is Wargames meets the Terminator, on Judgment Day. It was abridged, and maybe I was missing something. If it had been unabridged, I may have quit halfway through; six hours was too long. There was too much religion replacing or explaining science."
5,A Great Hook!!!,"This is the first Greg Iles book that I read. This book is my all time favorite book of his so far (I've read 8 so far) and is also a serious contender for the best book I've ever read! Reading it is like being on a roller coaster. It starts off a little slow, going uphill to get everything set and then you're off. The story keeps getting faster and faster and more and more interesting. The story is one that is plausible, and the characters are very believable. An excellent story with lots of action, adventure and intelligence.An excellent hook into Greg Iles's novels. From here, try any of his other books for more adventures."
4,A Long Trail,"Footprints of God starts off fast endearing us to a man torn between the death of his family and now his closest friend, who was at the cusp of an invention unlike anything seen, raising the suspicion that his death may not have been natural. During the serendipitous course of inventing, a discovery may have peeled the fabric of truth of Nature to reveal the proverbial footprints of a Maker of this Universe we live in. As such those involved with this mysterious invention begin to have inexplicable ailments that maybe illuminating deeply rooted events and experiences-- notably Holy events--that reside in all human brains but are locked until broken free by a controlled radiation of this novel Machine. The Machine, then, wants to follow in the footprints of its Maker. In all this, it is up to the reader to decide if the Human--by way of a protagonist--is the Machine, or the Maker, or perhaps both.The book is a little longer than it should be."
1,Greg Iles worst book!!!,"Greg Iles is one of the best thrill writers in the business, your in for a action-packed ride reading his books, and he's one of my favorite authors. I've picked this book up several times, but never purchased it, and found it at my local used book store. So I thought let's give it a try. Even though reading the back-jacket, nothing about it was appealing. This is just a dud, it's nothing like the action packed books that Iles normally writes, and just never got going for me. I just gave up on it after reading the first 70 pages. It's uncharacteristic of his books, very boring, just seems to bumble along, and go no where. Read any of his other books. Mortal Fear, Turning Angel, Blood Memory, captures him at his absolute best."
4,Used Books,"I live in a remote area of Northern California and have a hard time getting books that I want - I love reading Greg Isles novels. I received a gift certificate for Amazon and got online, looked for the book I wanted, it was available in the used books section, filled out my order and had it in my hands in a couple of weeks and it was in great condition."
4,"Good, not great Isles","As a big Greg Isles fan, I have been spoiled by his caliber of writing. The plot is uneven in spots, but still manages to be a page-turner. As a computer scientist, I question some of the underlying premises, but that did not detrct from my enjoyment."
4,Footprints of God,"I little slow and boring for the first couple of chapters, then I couldn't put it down. I love Greg Iles, always utilizing my brain cells, keeps them tuned up. I would highly recommend this book. Not for a light reader. Kept me on edge until the end!"
4,Interesting read,The book was a very interesting. Not disappointed at all and I received it very quickly and in good shape.
2,Where was the plot?,"I kept waiting for a plot to determine this was a mystery. You always knew what was happening so no suspense there. It just seemed like a written Hollywood chase scene to try and kill a couple of the characters. The idea of the super computer taken over by a human brain was very weak in my estimation. Probably wouldn't even have finished the book if a friend hadn't told me it was the best book he had ever read. Difference of tastes, I guess. Save your money for a good book."
2,"great writer, bad book","does peter james know about this !!!!i LOVE greg iles' and his other works, but this one is a rip off of a much better and earlier work on this subject ""HOST""very disappointed by ""footprints""i have faith iles' next effort is more original and a better novel"
5,Greg Iles Does It Again!,"Greg Iles amazes me with his diversity of plotting and themes in his books. I won't delve into details of this book since that has been done in the critics' reviews. This book definitely held my interest and I was fascinated with the blending of science and the search for answers to religious and universe origins. I don't give 5 stars lightly, and I highly recommend this book."
2,Somewhat predictable,"I am such a big fan of Greg Iles - that is why this is difficult to write. Unlike many of Iles' past books, there really was little character development or well developed meaning in THE FOOTPRINTS OF GOD. On the positive, the book did move quickly, but sadly, it is based upon a predicated theme, one that has been used over and over again."
2,not worth the time,"The book was intriguing at the start, read through easily and had a lot of potential. But the plot was without substance and the end was disappointing. It was not worth the time taken to read it."
1,Not even close...,Please don't mention this book in the same breath as THE DAVINCI CODE! And where in the world did Iles get the notion that there are armadillos in North Carolina/Tennesee?
1,Why,"I bought this book in a small airport, because it was scincefiction, though i would probly have been better off anthor of the few choices! the plot was see through, and writen in a very sexest manner. And while haveing a scintific baseis it didn't have much scinces in it."
1,Cliche-driven boring book,"Well, I guess that Greg Iles needs to write books to make money. But, when you run out of ideas, do you write drivel? Apparently, the answer is yes! And why do we have to give 1 star? I want the time that I spent reading this book back."
3,My Least Favorite Iles Book,"Scientists try to create artificial intelligence by replicating the human brain via circuitry. When they succeed, it runs amuck. As absurd as that first sentence sounds, Iles makes it almost believable. Certainly Iles gets some brownie points for an interesting theology/philosophy. The problems with this book are that the villians are just a bit too villanous to be believed, and the capability of computers is a bit too extraordinary to be creditable. I generally don't consider Iles a technical writer, just extremely capable of providing suspense. Certainly there's suspense here, but his presentation of technical matters needs to be improved a bit. If you're not highly technically savy, then this book will work just fine. If you're an engineer in a Dilbert world, then you might want to close one eye and sing na, na, na while glossing over some of the details."
3,"An ""Out There"" Greg Iles","I have been reading Greg Iles since Spandau Phoenix and I have loved all of his books, admiring his versatility. However, ""The Footprints of God"" was just a bit much for me. I felt like I was reading a hybrid of Steven Hawking/Michael Crichton/Robert Ludlum (still writing from the grave). The book centers around Dr. David Tenant, a doctor brought into the Trinity project for ethical monitoring. The Trinity Project centers around one man's vision for the development of artificial intelligience. Dr. Tenant finds his colleague, Dr. Fielding, murdered and he begins to fear for his life. The result is a plot filled with chases, hallucinations and a final showdown in the desert with a Max-style (2001: A Space Odyssey) computer. While I admire his flexibility in subjects, my desire is for Greg Iles to come back to the mainstream."
4,Anythings Possible,"What starts out as a desperate chase when scientist David Tennant suspects his employers are trying to kill him evolves into the ultimate ""what if"" scenario. Artificial Intelligence is on the brink of being created and along with it comes the terrifying possibility that tremendous power will be unleashed on the world.This is a very entertaining story that speeds along and combines the flavour of the month combination of science v religion."
3,Amusing light reading.,This book is more an account of a period in the writer's life than specifically about diving. Nevertheless it is entertaining enough to warrant reading.
2,Rapture of the Deep,This was not very good. Mostly about a guy bragging about himself and his travels. I am an experienced diver and did not find this book even interesting. Would not recommend. I have been to most all of the dive spots he described in his travels. He has a serious ego problem.
2,Rapture of the.. : And other stories You Don't Want To Know,"I feel this book was minimally entertaining and not very informative. The title really does not describe well what the book is really about. The title should be Zinsley's almost amusing bar stories, or Zinsley's love conquests. Maybe it is a book more designed for men. I was expecting more interesting dive stories and not so much how to kill a rooster in a tree. I think the book is worth reading but not at the price tag it carries. If it were 6.99 I would recommend buying it - maybe?"
2,Needs some editing,"This collection of stories are nothing to rave about. Although it may have been great living this divers life, He wasn't able to get that pont across to the reader. There is only so many times it's funny to read about a dive instructor get's drunk on a tropical island.... yadda yadda yadda."
2,Save your money and go diving.,"Divemaster gets drunk here. Divemaster gets drunk there. Divemaster gets laid. Divemaster makes fun of fat people.That's pretty much it. This collection of anecdotal stories has little if any point, and goes nowhere. Rather than the travelogue of interesting dive locales it claims to be, Rapture Of The Deep is little more than the kind of macho posturing you can find in any bar near any decent dive operator, but less interesting.You won't find idea for dive trips, and you won't find useful insights about diving or divers. If you feel you must read this, at least buy one of the used copies, as I guarantee they've never been read more than once."
4,Highly enjoyable read,"If you are one of those people tired of the 9-5 and beyond office grind, and dream of doing something more exotic with your life, this book will make you green with envy. Zinsley's book captures the spirit of diving, travel, and in particular Asian island life, though he delves into the Caribbean and Australia as well. He covers what it is like to live the bohemian life of a dive instructor in some of Asia's most famous diving and sun locales. Like listening to a buddy with really good stories, Zinsley's book is a funny and enjoyable read. I would especially recommend it to people keen on travel, diving, or anyone who merely wishes to do so."
5,A Captivating Read! Addicting from the very start!,"Give this book just five minutes of your time and read the first few pages...you will not put it down! Not just a book for diving enthusiasts, but a book for the adventurous! A vicarious thrill set in the most exotic locales! Buy this book for a phenomenal summer reading experience"
1,"Don't be fooled, these are junk.",I was shocked that that the 4 satellite speakers are dummies and are just for looks. I opened mine up wondering why there was no music or movement coming from those satellite speakers and found they are just cosmetic with no wiring. The base broke with several days. I didn't even bother returning these as they went straight into the trash. I and had bought 2 of these!
1,DOA,"Dead on Arrival. Base was broken and no replacement policy. I just got my money back and purchased a set of LogiTech speakers instead. They cost me a bit more, but they work and sound great."
1,THick as sludge,This was a terrible product and the price just low enough to make it not worth the hassle of returning.
3,Tan tan tan,"How about a review that actually has something to do with the material. Yes, your girlfriend was in it. Yes, you'd like to violate copyright law and post the content online. Yawn...Not a bad disc- plenty of women and all of them tan of course, but only about half blonde (which is a good thing far as I'm concerned!) The scenes are a little too short, and don't show quite enough goodies, but the lush backgrounds help."
2,too general,"This book is about incorparating, and only at its very end it becomes about incorporating in Nevada. If you need to know about the many kinds of corporations available or how to raise money for you company,go ahead and buy it. But remember you are going to find an entire chapter on general tax strategies and few lines about Nevada tax information, ending with:""if you require further information, please contact the Department of Taxation at (702) 687-4820"". I hope that having the number already here may save you the cost of this book...."
5,Good book written by someone who knows...,"Mr. Dicks is an attorney and a active business person. You won't find generic or plagerized advice written by ""paper tigers"" who write well but have no real world experience.There is a wealth of information in this and others in the ""How To"" series and ideal for anyone who wants facts and useful information."
4,Beautiful! But made in China,"I really love this item. I bought the spoon rest, standing spoon rest and dish drainer from the website. All the products were excellently designed with perfect quality and craftsmanship. There wasn't a flaw in any of the products. I was really disappointed to see ""Made in China"" on the bottom. I try to avoid Chinese manufactured products in general -- for political/economic and practical reasons (they're often junk or contain toxic materials). Aside from that, the products are very good and really beautiful. They were shipped the day I ordered them and arrived well-packed and very quickly. They're a five-star product, but I had to ding them on the Chinese manufacturing."
3,pleasant book,"An interesting hodge podge of stories, anecdotes, poems, etc. If one has a literary background and would recognize the names of the writers and storytellers featured, it makes the reading even more fun. Really need to be disciplined and read one a day since they are a gamut of topics and emotions."
5,great pinkies!,"These pens for the price are fantastic! As usual Pentel R.S.V.P. pens don't fail, the ink always flows and you use the pen up to the last drop. It would have been nice if the ink would have been a rose color, otherwise these pens are a bargain."
1,Among the worst ballpoint pens I've used,"I respectfully disagree with the other reviewers as my experience with this ballpoint pen has been awful. While mine says it's a medium, it is certainly not a 1.0 line. Mine is more a fine medium point. The blue ink is smudgy, the ball is scratchy and frequently blobs ink on the paper. It never starts writing without first exercising the point. Upon first using it there is an annoying movement at the tip that clicks it into the section. Generally when I begin using a ballpoint, I use it to the end, but with a quarter of the ink left in this pen, I'm throwing it out; enough is enough. While it is possible I simply got a bad one, I strongly recommend you do not buy this pen."
5,Cheap but last a long tme,"I love these pens. They are cheap, but last forever.They are lightweight, fit well in my hand and I love the rubber pad for comfort. I was always go for this pen when I have a bit of writing so I finally got rid of all my odd and end pens and replaced with these."
5,Just.... Beatiful,I've only heard the soundtracks of Emir Kusturicas movies... but I got to say when I hear the song ''Aven Ivenda'' I feel like crying a river... it's just beatiful... how do they feel the songs... just beatiful.. amazing... all the cd is amazing.... great... unexplicable....
1,Impossible to Get Refills,"Why pay this much for an Avery e-Grip, when you can get a Bic large grip pen for more than a dollar less and order 12 refills directly from Bic for only $5? I've been all over local stores and the web looking for e-Grip refills and can't find them in local retail stores at all. On the web, all I can find is 2 refills for prices ranging from $2 to $3.75 and THEN the suppliers want shipping charges from $7.95 to $12.95. This, for a couple of plastic refills that weigh less than an ounce. I'd call these accursed refills about the most poorly provided product support I've ever seen for any office supply."
2,Fine to watch once,"This was a technically well-made film about the kind of people who only appear in these kinds of films - in other words it bears little resemblance to reality. The acting is actually not bad, although Janine will never win any award for her acting ability. Kira Reed, is indeed very hot and personally she was the best part of the film for me. Janine is usually steamy, but she was a rather minor character, although her attempted seduction of Kira was very nice. Their ultimate consummation was very tame which was disappointing. Janine and her female one night stand in the bathroom was erotic, but hardly new nor as hot as she has been in the past. All in all this was a film I enjoyed to watch once, but it does not bear watching repeatedly. Still, it has high production values."
1,Not what I expected,The book was said to be new but instead I got a crusty disgusting book. It looked like a book you would get from the library and smelled like someone had read it on the toilet then sent it to me. When I am told a book is new and I am paying for a new book I expect it
3,Know what you are buying.,"This video is actually surprisingly instructional. Not being too familiar with either playboy videos or massage, my wife and I weren't sure what to expect. We found some of the massage vignettes quite helpful. My wife in particular likes the one on shiatsu massage. Based on my difficulty following along with all the massage moves, I am guessing that the (mostly beautiful) models in this video are actually experienced masseusses (sp?). On the erotic side, this video doesn't quite cut it. As my wife so succinctly put it ""its just a bunch of naked people giving massages"". I would note, however, that the shiatsu hasn't failed yet...."
4,Something for everyone,"Playboy did a nice job and thought of nearly everything. The models are attractive, the settings can be recreated easily by anyone. Background music is Classic and won't go out of style. Narrator doesn't talk too much and has a soothing voice. It isn't salacious and spends just the right amount of time on each technique. Really liked it."
4,sensual in good taste,"This video is very relaxing to watch and the couples are attractive.The moves demonstrated are realistic and don't require any special talents.Somewhat erotic but in very good taste,unlike some other videos with similar titles.Recommended."
2,Weak all around. No big thrill either.,Far below the usual Playboy stuff. Low budget with third string models. Dull and disappointing. No way would I recommend this.
3,Does not work on XBox 360,"I was excited to find this for my son for Christmas, however it will NOT work on XBOX 360 so if that is your system, don't purchase this.If someone knows how to get it to work, please post or contact me. My son really wants to play this game!"
4,"Very Good, But..........","At first this game seems amazing and really fun. But after a while you find that there is certain ways in which you can aut apart the computer's back line. This makes it far to easy to win against the computer, eg. I beat New Zealand with Spain on hard. But once you start to play multiplayer then you start to realise how good this game is.One thing that EA could improve on is penalties. It would be really good if you could do penalties moves and even create your own.So overall, a very fun game to play against a human on multiplayer, but is really easy against the computer."
4,awesome tea set for the money,I spent far too much time looking for a good tea set for my daughter when she was 2 years old. I finally found this one and it's been a hit. It was less expensive than a lot of the tea sets I looked at and it is plastic and sturdy and has held up after a lot (as in daily) of use and abuse over the last year. It also comes with everything a tea set should have. It was well worth the fairly low cost.
5,"We are happy, it has brought joy to our home",I actually got this product for my son to play with mostly in the bath tub. He is just learning how to pour liquid from one container to the next and the tea pot and cups work fantastic for that. Plus the added bonus of being able to teach him how to pretend eat. I picked this set out purposefully because the colors were not too girly. My son is only 17 months old so I did not give him all the pieces because he would have been overwhelmed plus I did not give him the teapot top because it is relatively small. He really enjoys it and had taken the teapot out of the bathroom several times to play with in his toy room.
4,"great pictures, but could be more on just cardi's",all the pictures were great. and the book had lots of great info in it. there could have been more on the breed though. but overall i would buy it all over again.
2,Worth less than its modest price...,"This boilerplate-based book has very little content that is actually Corgi-specific, and most of what it does have is a reprint of the AKC Pembroke Welsh Corgi standard. The history section is interesting and well-written albeit brief, and some of the generic copy is nicely illustrated with Corgi photos. The bulk of the book, however, is generic, with generic illustrations."
5,great dog : good book,"You can think its easy to write a good book just because of cardies but this one is very interesting, every moment in a dog's life is detailed.A book to read."
2,Great while it lasts,"I bought this slicer about a year ago. It was great: cutting hard-boiled eggs into slices OR into 6 wedges. But after 6 months of use, the wires in the wedge cutter broke, springing out of the slicer.It is a great idea, but the product just didn't hold up to normal home use."
2,Not All That Great,"Anyways, I purchase this DVD to get some better tips on how to play faster.The instructor is amazing but the problem is, he doesn't know how to teach.Like whenever he goes to a new lesson, he just zooms and doesn't really explain and teaches WAY TOO FAST.He doesn't give enough time, plus when he speaks he pause's too much and stutters as he's thinking about the next word to say.I'm not talking bad about him, he's an amazing musician.I'm almost in the advance stages in my music career and I'm a music major at school.I've had alot of teachers amazing like the instructor on this DVD that knew how to teach but this guy doesn't know how to teach.I bought another guitar DVD from this same series but for sweeping and let me tell you, I recommend that DVD to everyone and it's for all level of musicians, its incredible.Great instructor, he explains in details, and does it at a good moderate pace while teaching."
5,Great story!,I had never heard of this book. My class and I loved reading it very much! Great price as well!
1,Very poor sensor,"This thing doesn't shut off even when the room is brightly lit. I bought it because I wanted a very dim night light and it does fit the bill there, but if it doesn't turn off automatically it becomes pretty useless IMO."
2,could be better,"Its just average. The one-year updates cost $49.95! whats up with that? Encarta 2008 immediately updates upon installation. Free. Yes, can't use the software if you do a full install to your hard drive."
2,Britannica Ultimate Falls Short,"In many ways this is a useful and complete encyclopedia, particularly for geographical, political and historical topics.However not enough effort is put into updating technical articles. For example, the article on the technology of photography is 25 to 30 years out of date. Digital still photography is not mentioned. The closest is a reference to the original Sony Mavica, an analog electronic media camera. The bibliography for photographic technology cites sources from the mid 1980's and earlier.This encyclopedia would be far better if updating of topics were consistent throughout."
2,Save your money,"My only reasoning for acquiring Britannica was I thought that spending some money could land me a more comprehensive resource for quick research other than the free Wikipedia. As soon as I installed it, I did some quick article comparisons between the $35 ""2008 Ulimate Britanica"" and the free Wikipedia and found that pretty much on every article I was looking at, Britannica fell way short in the depth of content. Their articles were at least 75% shorter than the ones offered on Wikipedia, it offered no scholarly citations, no organization, few pictures, and fewer articles in general.I'm not here promoting Wikipedia, but I was just wanted perhaps a more credible source of information. Instead, I only found that there was just so little information on this product it's not even worth the comparison. I hope Encarta is a lot better than this... or is our encyclopedic authority left to precarious user-submitted sites?I am a college student at a four-year university, btw."
5,Great tool for school,"This has come in so handy for reports that my kids have done. There are three different levels that you can use, depending on the age of the person using it. I'm so glad that I bought it!"
4,Decent Learning Software,"I purchased this software last year because I had to write quite a few papers for a certain college class. I used this software quite frequently. It was a great tool to use to help me get the correct information fast about the topics that I needed to write about. It has different formats so it can be used by children, teenagers, and adults. If you are in school or have a child in school, this product could definitely help you/them with class work or just general knowledge."
4,EDDIE KENDRICK FANS BE AWARE,Tim Kepler reminds me of Eddie Kendrick from the Temptations with his smooth tenor voice that ranges somewhere out of the atmosphere. Tim's album is very smooth and impressed me with this deep felt emotion of what he is singing about. R&B lovers will love this album.
2,Taste is really bad.,On top of it being a fatty product the taste is overwhelmingly disgusting and you can't get used to it. It stinks up your bottle too.
3,"Good service, iffy product.",I wish I knew the serving sizes before I purchased. This wasn't nearly as good as the quality versions of isopure. My own fault fir not researching. Too many scoops per serving make it nasty. I got what I paid for.
3,Dont order through nutricity,"Dont order through nutricity. They sent the order out almost two weeks after the latest estimated delivery, no tracking details, no communication regarding the delay either until I contacted them to cancel the order."
2,Product Misrepresented,"Have used this product for several years. However, the last couple of variety packs received have not had any ""orange creamsicle"" flavor packets, instead having extra ""chocolate peanut butter swirl"" flavor packets instead. This is not as advertised."
1,No muscle gains,"I've been on 2 boxes of Isopure and had no gains. I took the protein shake within an hour of the workout.On the mother-of-all bodybuilding forum, forum.[...], I've NEVER seen this protein mentioned among the best protein supplements.Even though it seems like a product made with quality ingredients, Nature Best Isopure seemed ineffective for me. I do not recommend this protein powder."
3,NOT Low Carb Version,"I bought this ""assuming"" it was a low carb version. 25g Carb, 0 fiber and 1g sugar makes me wonder what in the world is in it. 50g of protein for 300 calories is more than I wanted too. I haven't tried them yet, I will probably just end up pawning them off on someone instead of messing up my diet. Nutrition facts would have been helpful. :/ I will post a picture of them for future purchasers."
2,Odd taste,"I got this sampler pack before investing in a large jar of the product to see what flavors I liked, but I didn't like any. They have a weird aftertaste and are quite thick. Try the Syntax Matrix Protien shakes if you're looking for a good tasting brand."
3,tasty but not for weightloss,"I love the fact that there are individual packets with assorted flavors. The shakes taste great, but because there are no nutritional facts listed for the product on amazon.com, I didn't realize that I was purchasing protein that is NOT RECOMMENDED FOR WEIGHT LOSS, which was my intent. Therefore, I have tried two of the packets, but the rest now sits in the pantry."
5,A Badly Neglected Subject,"Given the large number of business books it's surprising that so few have drawn out the similarities between business and war. Col. Allard's Business As War does an especially good job of making the comparison, and of noting the differences. It will be important for business readers especially because it focuses on the essential constants of war and business.Paul BrackenProfessor of ManagementYale School of Management"
4,Good business book. Very practical,"Business people are too ""fad"" based. This is a good solid exposition of how the military systems can teach business how to do things effectively."
1,Misleading book - No business as war,I ordered this book to read about business war games.There is nothing about business. Only comments about his military life. I learned nothing. A wast of time and money.
2,Neoprene Doesn't Seal,"The Speedo Sprint goggle used to be a good goggle. The nose bridge is adjustable, and so it doesn't cut the bridge of your nose as much as some non-adjustable goggles. For six bucks, a good deal.BUT... seems they can't just leave a good thing alone. The eye seals _used to be_ silicone, and they used to be nice and sticky and make a good seal. Now they use neoprene, which just doesn't work. It takes a struggle to make this goggle seal to your eyes now, and then only by jamming it in at eyeball-sucking pressure, at which point the corners of the hard neoprene seal poke your eyesockets uncomfortably. I think the product designer at Speedo has never been swimming.If you remember this goggle as good, I recommend you check the seal material. You may be disappointed."
3,PA system,"I bought these to use in my PA system (voice not music) and they do work and sound ""ok"" but don't put hardly any power to them. I had to resister them way down to keep them from shutting down."
4,As Strong As They Should Be,"I think that these are some of the best piezo tweeters that I have used. The sound is excellent. As one knows, there is not a requirement for a crossover of any kind. I am now going to pass this info onto all of my music mates. The price was amazing."
2,Snoozefest.,"Man, this movie was boring. Here's the plot (try not to get too excited now). There's this blind woman. She plays the cello on the beach. She gets hired by this ugly Russian guy to help him perform his newest concerto. He's been sitting around getting drunk since his wife died. She can't play very well so he helps her get better by having sex with prostitutes. This makes her go sleep with her roommate's boyfriend. Then he makes her have sex in front of all these people with masks. But he leaves the room before she's finished. This makes her mad, so she goes and gets eye surgery and she can see again. Then she and ugly Russian guy perform his concerto and then they have sex.Not even the sex scenes can redeem this movie. I'm not even sure how many of them there were since they were filmed so ""artsy"" that half the time, I couldn't figure out if I was even watching sex. And the ones that were clearly sex scenes weren't very memorable.I can't recommend this one at all."
2,Cheesy!,"I just received this wallet, which I bought as a Christmas gift, and was very disappointed. It arrived in a padded envelope, in a thin cardboard box, and looks like vinyl, even though ""genuine leather"" is stamped on the back. Honestly, this looks like something you'd pick up for $5 at your local flea market. Adding in the shipping AND tax, I pad almost $50 for this. I'll be returning it, if I'm lucky. It arrived without a receipt or a packing slip enclosed. Don't waste your money on this one!"
5,Don't miss WESTCHESTER STATION,"Here's a terrific story about the decisions a man must make that applies to life as well as the assorted group of people he meets from different places and different times. This is a well-written, intelligent book. Don't let this one pass you by."
1,What you see isn't what you get,"Very disappointed in this product and Amazon's response to the problem.Item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until I complained that it was not included, this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed.They have told me they can't supply the missing part (the metal neck strap showing in the photo) as item comes from a freight forwarder. I did not get what I paid for and unable to return because item has been forward shipped out of the country."
1,metal shavings in juice,"This juicer works well enough, but I started noticing metal shavings in the juice and under the juicer. I'm not fond of ingesting metal shavings so I plan to contact the company and demand an explanation and a refund. I do NOT recommend buying this item until this problem is resolved."
1,OriangeX has very poor customer service,"I brought OrangeX made in iron and stainless steel... After few uses the small washer fell off. I tried to contact their customer service either the line is busy or is answering machine and sent e-mail I've never get any answer. Now when I tried to use the juicer, the top of press will crook to the left, does not match to the bottom of the stainless steel part. They have 7 years garantee for what?"
4,Good all around plant design,"This is a good book for anybody, non-professionals included, as it has lots of color photos of the plants and plant combinations, covers forms of plants and how they might look together for the most part. Also went over ""color"" schemes and how to combine those from an ""artists"" point of view. Obviously you will need to do further learning to educate yourself on exactly what plants work best in your area, possibly the Sunset Best Western Garden Guide? This book is missing a lot, if you want to really get into the nuts and bolts of professional landscape design, but as an addition to your library and for what it offers, I would recommend it."
4,Actually worked pretty well,"I started taking these at the beginning of allergy season this year for the first time. I took 2 in the morning and 2 at night in conjunction with my zyrtec. These actually helped my symptoms, not completely, but I did breathe easier at night and woke up less times with a stuffy nose."
5,Great Quality and Look Very Nice,"I had to go online to find a 30"" bar for our bathroom, and was a little leary ordering these online sight unseen, but they are wonderful. Very nice quality - not cheapy, like most. Good color - true to the image. Fairly easy to install (i.e. only limited cursing from my hubby ;). Highly recommended. We got two towel rings and the towel hook to match, and they all look fantastic in our formerly gold trimmed master bath. And not made in China for a change! (Portugal)."
2,Poor quality,I bought this towel bar about 2 years ago and the bar portion is turning/ has turned gold. It will do OK as long as you do not leave anything wet on it for too long. The quality is mediocre. I have never had a towel bar do that before. I have to replace it now to match my other fixtures but will make sure to keep it as dry as possible in the future. I should add that we live in a dry climate.
3,It's a towel bar,"Purchased this because it matched the rest of the fixtures in the rest of the bathroom and the one being replaced was damaged by someone using it as a hand rail (house guests). Based on other reviews, and the price, I got the impression this was a strong and sturdy bar. The supports attached to the wall are very sturdy, especially if you secure it to the wall studs, however the bar doesn't seem to be stronger than a 1/2"" pvc pipe. Well it will hold up a bunch of towels but it definitely will not serve as a hand rail or pull up bar. After all it is a towel bar. Thought it was a bit pricey since I had to buy 2 sets."
4,Does the job,I like their size and the fact that the replacement brushes are easy to obtain.They work really well and when they need cleaning I just throw them in the dishwasher....until it's time to buy a new replacement set.
4,Mystic Places Of Dawn (Remastered),"New artwork is amazing. The record is Septic Flesh's early material. It's filled with creative ideas about Lemuria, an ancient civilization about the time of Atlantis, Pnath, the underworld, and Sarnath the doomed. Ripping guitar leads and growls aplenty. A must for every fan of Septic Flesh."
2,Ugly,"This is the ugliest Barbie doll. My daughter refers to it as the the ""Ugly Barbie."" I would not buy this doll again."
2,New Panama Cruising Guide by Eric Bauhaus is way better,We just finished (July 2006) cruising the Pacific side of Panama and through the canal and found the Zydler guide to not be as useful as the newer Bauhaus guide. The major difference is in the charts & chartlets - the Bauhaus guide is all color charts that look like real charts - the Zydler guide is all B&W hand drawn sketches that are extremely hard to read - virtually useless. The Zydler guide has more words but less useful information as it's quite a bit older and some information is way out of date - eg. the Western Panama Islands like Coiba.
4,Same boot for over 10 years,"This boot is very light weight very comforable, the leather soal is very thin that's why the boot is so light. This boot will not wear as well as other boots which are much more in price, but at the price you can buy 2 for the price of one. You do not have to break this boot in, but it on and you will feel you have been wearing this boot for weeks! I have been buying this boot for years, I own my own business and I'm on my feet all day 10 hours plus. I put this new boot on and 10+ hours later when I go home my feet are in good shape! Tell me what other boot for the price can do that! This boot is made in India and I truly hope this never changes.For this boot and no other shoe I am a Nun Bush supporter!!!!!"
1,Not the Nunn Bush I know,"Very stiff and unflexible. Returned immediately. I have a pair of Nunn Bush Ankle Dress Boots that are 10 years old. Very comfortable the first time I wore them and I'm still wearing them. Very disapointed with Bristol Boot, very satiesfied with Amazon return and fast credit on my account."
1,Broke,"I bought this pitter since it was a little bit cheaper than the others on Amazon. I had a pound of cherries to pit for a batch of brandied cherries and made it 2/3 of the way through before the red plastic piece holding the tool together snapped. The cherries were good, but this cherry pitter is now in the trash."
1,Broken after two uses,This is not a high quality product at all. It's a very flimsy plastic. The thing fell apart after two uses.
1,Broke within weeks.,This broke within weeks receiving. Goes back to you get what you pay for. It was inexpensive and it broke like it was.
1,"I trusted you, Avery!","It's a really nice, sturdy pen/pencil combo. But the stylus does not work. At all. Not one little hyperlink linked; useless!"
1,Does not work with iPhone or iPad surfaces -- and never tells you!,"I got this to go with an app program on my iPad. First off, no where does it tell you that it doesn't work with these capacitive surfaces. That includes the packaging. I'm returning it and I'm ticked off. C'mon Avery, make it CLEAR for your CUSTOMERS!So I will; Do not buy this for use with iPhone or iPad. It will simply not work."
3,It's ok,"Yeah... the pen and pencil are good. The stylus doesn't work on my Samsung Note, iphone or ipad. So I don't know what it will work on. Since two thirds work I gave it three stars... I wasn't happy about it, but oh well."
3,Stylus does not work with Droid cellphones,"The pen and pencil may be okay, but the stylus doesn't work with Droid cellphone touchscreen - which was one of the main reasons I ordered this. Returning it!"
2,Not for iPad or iPhone,Nice looking product. Does not work for capacitive touch screens that detect heat (energy). A little frustrating since I read a lot of reviews and must have missed it. Darn.
2,Does not work for apple products!,"Need to put uses in description. Seemed like great idea until I paid $10 for a pen /pencil I can get anywhere. Does seem like it would be sturdy but without use on iPad, it's going back. I hope they don't try the 20% restock fee, if so, I will be sure never to use there services again, customer service gets my attention."
2,disappointed!,I have just finished reading this book and was quite disappointed with it-maybe as ive lived on and off in the middleeast there was nothing i didnt already know but mainly it was the ending-from the start of the book the author mentions that she was warned that working with royals could end as soon as it began and she was to experience this and it would be explained at the end but she didnt and so i felt it let the whole book down!!!
1,Laughably bad.,"Stay away from the early Playboy DVDs/videos, as typified by ""The Best of Wet and Wild."" It's full of embarassing narration (I don't need some make announcer cooing at me about how sexy the women are), moronic segments and anti-sexy photography.A much better choice: Playboy's Girls of Hawaiian Tropic."
3,Limited,"This book was interesting but very limited in scope. I had expected the focus to be on the architectural and engineering aspects of the tower, but the book was more a history of Pisa. Having been to the tower in 2001 during the most recent attempts at stabilizing the strucutre it was disappointing that only one page of the entire volume was devoted to information on how this was accomplished. A bit more science would have greatly enhanced the value of the book. Also, the book design makes for uncomfortable reading and seems like a gatuitous gimmick."
5,Inspirational,"This is a great story to read to a child who is afraid of something. It tells about a little bug who lives in a ""dark and dreary hole"" and he never leaves the hole because of his fears. A voice tell him that he should try to see the world. He does and is so much happier."
4,Short but good,"Vital to any fans of Buffy. A few missing cast members including Angel, Willow and Giles are missing but Spike and Seth Green are there and steal the show."
3,A bit disapointing,"While the lighting might be Hollywood style, the photos not so much. There is a section where he shows his portfolio allegedly created with similar setup as shown, but none of those pics behind the scenes are shown. He also uses hot lights, and setups are indoors. I like the section where he starts with a dark room, and goes on showing the effect of each light. Overall satisfying but I was expecting more."
3,Helpful but a bit clunky,This was a helpful dvd but a bit clunky in it's presentation. The photographer repeats himself a lot. The setup of the lighting was helpful but I would have liked more help with classic Hollywood posing as well.
3,GREAT SEMI PORNO FILM,"It's quite explicit for a ""mainstream"" film; i.e., not XXX. For my money, Amber Newman wins the race for the sexiest girl. Unfortunately, Stephanee LaFleur makes only brief appearance; she's one of my personal favorites."
3,HAS ITS MOMENTS,"To my mind, the best part of this so-so film is the one featuring Amber Newman, one of the best ... simulators in the soft core genre.The appeal of Julie Ashton has always eluded me. I know she has been in many XXX films and has made a success of herself perhaps through sheer exposure (no pun intended). However, I find her squeeky voice and general manner annoying.The character of the monk I found was distracting and poorly acted."
4,"Silly, fun, and beautiful nude women","What can I say, this movie doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is...a sexy romp! It's simple, silly and fun. But most of all it has beautiful nude women. Amber Newman is gorgeous, playful, sexy and hot in her big...scene."
5,Great toy for my puppy,"This is the favorite toy for my puppy, I keep them in a drawer. Every time I open that drawer, he comes running thinking he's going to get a tiny dog chew toy."
5,Tiny but good,"When they say tiny, they mean tiny. Ordered this for my 9 pound terrier and it disappeared in her mounth. I would't suggest ordering this size unless you have a tiny dog. However, I like this product just like it's larger sizes. I have some agressive chewers that love the filling but can barely dent the outer covering. It satisfies their desire to chew without the worry they will swallow pieces of material that might hurt them."
5,treasure treat,"I purchased this product over two yrs. ago and believe it or not, my dog Teddy still played with and chewed on the bone long after the edible treat inside the plastic bone was gone. Searched and searched for this since then but couldn't find it anywhere until one day at a small town grocery store. I bought all of them and found the website on the package so that I can now purchase this great little toy/treat for Teddy. He absolutely loves them."

3,ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING DVD's OF IT'S KIND SO FAR,"This DVD was totally hot in the beginning, Gabriella (Susan Featherly) arrives home to discover her husband is unsatisfied with her innocence, and is indulging during a lunch break with one of the hottest young gals I've seen in a long time..Angie (Penthouse Pet Hotted Crystal Craft) Monte and Craft by far have the hottest scene in this flick ... lucky for you & your partner; it's in the first five minutes! After all's said and done, be assured this film will only spice up your evening."

Throw this one in the machine and get busy! -OR- Your girl want to try to get turned on by video... watch it together...for LOADS of fun! Don't get me wrong...there's no story line worth following but you don't buy movies like this for the story line....do you!"

5,Sung Buddhism,"Studies of Buddhism in China continue to flourish, and this is an excellent collection of essays that showcase the strengths of a historically-informed understanding of this religious tradition. Hawaii continues to lead the field in its publication of high-quality monographs and essay-collections on Buddhism. Some of the essays in the collection are stronger than others, though on the whole, this is a quite readable scholarly work. Shinohara's essay is especially good."
2,"neat, but imperfect gadget","This highly specialized gadget is a terrific concept that could use some tuning, especially considering the price. The cutter's own blade is not very sharp. (Suppose you'd want a sheath if it was, since it's probably going to be found rattling around in people's kitchen drawers.) You have to exert a fair amount of pressure, while carefully holding the egg so it doesn't slip out. Even then, tiny bits off egg seem to find their way into the final product."
4,Really Quite Good,"I have owned these speakers for a about a year. I bought them at a sidewalk sale in my neighborhood in Brooklyn. I use them to broadcast the audio from various satellite channels to where I sit at my computer. The distance is no more than 30 feet so I cannot say how they would function over much longer distances.As opposed to some of the reviewers, I have had no difficulty adjusting the frequency. I have very occasional static interference but for the most part this is a non issue. In essence, I use them in an urban environment on one floor of a brownstone here in Brooklyn so I cannot say how they might operate in your neighborhhood. I have them set for mono as this this tends to minimize whatever small amount of interference there may have been. This has a slight effect on frequency response but it is not major.Please note that the fidelity is quite good but it is NOT audiophile quality so it is probably good to take that into account. All in all, I very good product."
5,Wireless Speakers,I am very pleased with these speakers. As a matter of fact I just ordered a second pair for the school. We use the cafeteria to show videos to two or three classes at a time. I use an LCD projector to enlarge the picture and I place these speakers in the back of the cafeteria so the students in the back can hear clearly.
4,Great product ever!!,This product has excellent sound. I couldnt find a better set of wireless speakers. The distance you can move the speakers is awsome! I think everyone should own this product!
4,Very comprehensive,This very comprehensive book goes through all the aspects of options from hedging to delta strategies. It explains thouroughly the greeks. I like it since it is written in a simple and clear language but not dumbed down. It has some math and very clear examples. What I think is missing is a little about the trading of this instruments in online systems.
5,Must read,"If I could only have one options book, I would choose this one. Those who find this book difficult to comprehend are not ready to trade options."
1,Good for Book End,Great stuff for floor traders. You can buy any software package that does automatically what the author takes 300 pages to explain.Reality is you need a basic understanding of the contents of this book that you can get better from other authors. This is not a practical book on how to get started and apply the theory. It is a floor traders impression of what they have to know. Do they use it or are they required to learn it?As a full time option trader I have been successful without worrying in depth about the mathematical values of the greeks. My software does that for me. Leaving me to trade.The book stops my other books falling over as it is heavy and looks impressive to my trader visitors who pick it up. Grunt and then put it down. They don't understand it either.We just make money trading options so what do we know.Thanks for the bookend.
1,Are you kidding???,This bok was written by a trader for professional traders. Not only is very difficult to understand but the strategies are only useful if you are a professional trader. Only market makers can make money trading this way! Beginners should save their money and not buy this book!
1,Too much theory and no application,I bought this book and returned it as it was far too complicated for the average person. I was after a practical application of option trading not just the theory.
2,Very informative... Too informative... okay okay it stank!,This is unfortunately the way to NOT write a book. If you want to reach people you need to keep it interesting. This book was tough to stay into. It has lots of good information but it took about 2-3 months to read.It's comparable to college texts and probably needs to be taken a section at a time. Good information none-the-less. Buy it if you really hope to master options trading.
5,A must for anyone in the business!,"This book is a MUST read for anyone in the options business. If you are planning on trading options for a firm or on the floor this book is like the bible (just ask anyone else). However, a word of caution, this is NOT a book for someone who wants to get an introduction to options (pick up Thomsett's book instead). In my opinion, this book is geared towards readers who want to know more about the details of how options are priced (something that every clerk or runner aspiring to be an options trader should know). In that aspect, it is one of a kind. An excellent read."
5,Vital reading for non-floor traders too!,"Anyone who is serious about trading options needs a firm grasp of the greeks. Natenberg is a master at taking a very complex subject and making it as clear as possible. If you aren't dedicated to actually learning options seriously, then this probably isn't for you. But if you plan on learning options strategies, this book needs to be part of your liberary!"
2,Toooo... much theory. Not enough examples to reinforce,The book dwells on too much theory:1)Not hands on.2)Too much of explanation with few examples and kind of feel abstract sometimes.I got headache and resold mine. Don't get carried away by the 5 star reviews. This might not be for everyone.
3,Not for option newbe,"I was just beginning to get into option trading when I bought this book and was trying to reach a level of comfort before I actually began trading. This book is definitely not for someone just starting out in this field of investment. However if the reader already has a basic grasp of options fundamentals as is looking for more in-depth understanding of the different ways options can be used, then this might be the book for them."
5,Nateberg Rules,"Some people think this book is too complex. Its not if you just follow it methodically and take your time to learn the material. Its the best, most comprehensive learning tool for options that I have found."
2,Be careful with the statistical inferences.,"The book does a good job in taking a risk perspective in decision making with options trading. I like the way the author takes a trader's perspective. However the are errors that will mislead a novice who wants to use the statistical thought process. Most notably, on page 58, he states ""One character of standard deviations is that they are additive"" which is fundamentally incorrect. In his example, a one standard deviation (""sd"") of 3 from a mean of 7.5 would give a range of $7.5 +/- $6 for two standard deviations ( a 95% probability). This is incorrect. The 3 sd needs to be squared, doubled then square rooted again to arrive at a two standard deviation of 4.24 (not 6). Therefore, the stock will range from 11.74 to 3.25 with 95% certainty NOT 15.5 to 1.5, as inferred by the author.Please be careful as I have found others.Frank."
2,A heavy hammer with which to hit large nails,"The thick green book is a reference for options professionals. It requires deep thought and carefull reading, almost like being back in college. As a bible, I would hardly recommend it for beginners, but it is suitable for the mathematically inclined eggheads that do not have software available. Nowdays, you can get programs that will do much of what this book explains at the push of a button. If you already have an options book, this is the advanced text and a classic on the shelves right now."
5,Extremely useful book.,"I have read this book very quickly. Very easy, friendly and informative. A lot of useful information which can be applied practically."
3,Good for the over 50 crowd,"This is not one of Morley's best, but it's worth the read just to get you thinking about mid-life and beyond. Good for starting discussions with friends or others about mid-life issues."
3,"Adequate box, slicer plastic shreds","I have had this box for a while now and it works fine. It doesn't allow too much air in and it fits nicely in my cabinet, unlike most other bread boxes at which I had looked when I bought it. The slicing guide's rungs are perfectly spaced for my purposes but the guide's bottom isn't grooved so my knife slices into it to fully cut through the bread. Over time this has caused some slight shredding of the plastic and I'm starting to have to brush off little splinters from my slices before eating them. If the slicing guide is a selling point for you then I recommend looking elsewhere and make sure to either get one with either a cutting-board density wooden base or one with a grooved bottom so that you don't end up getting splinters stuck in your intestine."
1,Poor Product,"This does not keep the bread fresh. On the contrary, it allows air in and the bread dries out. Disappointing!"
4,Neat idea,I was looking for a cutting guide and got the freshness keeper too! It manages to hold most loaves and reduces the crumbs a lot.Expandable Bread Keeper with Slicing Guide by Progressive
3,Not quite what I expected,"The product description says it fits a regular size loaf of bread, but it is a bit short for that. It would fit a standard size loaf from a bread machine, I guess, but I haven't used it for that yet. Otherwise, it's pretty much what I expected."
4,hope for an option with no bread slicer,I don't really use the slicer guide so I hope they will just have a product that only offers a box for keeping bread. And the price will be lowered as well.
3,Progressive International Clearly Fresh Bread Keeper,"It's pretty good for the price. It's a good storage container for bread maker bread loafs. The slicing guide more or less works, but is kind of flimsy. I definitely can cut straighter equal slices with it, than with out it. Although I might have wished I spent a few dollars more for something a little sturdier."
5,Perfect Storage Box for Breadmaker Bread !,"I liked this box sooo much I ordered 3 more the next day .. I keep one at work, 2 at home, and gave one to my Mom for her weekly loaf of cinamon bread. The slice guices work great, and are perfectly sized."
1,Does exactly what it promises but got REALLY expensive,"Keeps my bread machine loaves fresh for a good long time, which saves me time and money as I don't have to bake so often. I like being able to see at a glance how much bread I have left. I don't need a slicing guide so I removed it. Easy to wash out, and it doesn't take much counter space. For the price you really can't go wrong.Revised my review. What happened to the price? I paid a fraction of what it's being sold for now."
2,"Makes decent keeper, but guide is marginal","If you are looking for more of a bread cutting knife guide, don't buy this product. But otherwise, the plastic case keeps the bread adaquately."
2,Inherently Flawed,"The bread slicer guide is cheap but useful. The bread keeper operates on the principle that the bread needs air and this provides airholes at each end. After putting a freshly baked loaf of raisin bread in the keeper at bedtime and revisiting it again in the morning, the keeper had tiny gnat-like flies who were drawn to the loaf inside the keeper and had easy access via the airholes. Assuming the sweet raisins were the reason this happened I tried a plain white loaf the next day with exactly the same results."
4,good product,"I was looking for a convenient way to keep bread fresh and this is really great. Rather than use it the ""long"" way on the counter, I keep it so that I lift the top up and off. I use the slicer constantly and it's a big help, but I do wish it were a little less flimsy. I'm always slicing into the plastic at the bottom of the bread. I wonder how long it will last. But then again, I haven't found anything else like it or better to buy and it wasn't very expensive."
2,Not impressed,"After seeing all the great reviews for this item, I figured this would be the one for me. How wrong I was!!! I find the guide to be pretty flimsy, especially for sturdier breads like rye and whole wheat. After six months of use, there are knife marks scratching the bottom, and it's almost impossible to clean. I'm going to look for a wood bread guide, as that is what I'm used too. The bread keeper is not functional at all."
2,Progressive Internationalclearly fresh bread keeper,"The bread keeper does help slice bread evenly, but it is rather flimsy and if not careful it may break easily while holding the bread with your free hand when slicing. The part that is flimsly are the tynes(slicing separaters)."
3,I like the bread cutter.,"I make bread because I have a son who is allergic to wheat and dairy. The bread slicer allows me to slice straighter and thinner pieces of bread which is great - I get more pieces out of a loaf and they look better. It works fine but I wish the slicer was a little more sturdy. Truthfully I purchased this product for the slicer not the bread keeper. The bread keeper works O.K., I especially like it when we travel because it keeps the bread from getting crushed, but gets smaller as we use up a loaf. I don't love the air holes in the bread keeper, it is too much air for rice bread and tends to allow it to dry out too quickly, but it would probably work better for wheat bread. For the price, this was a good purchase, plus I couldn't find a better bread slicer even at a higher price."
4,"Works well, could be studier","We bake about five 1-1/2 pound loaves of whole grain bread per week and used our first bread keeper for 10 months before the slicing guide broke. We replaced it immediately as we could find nothing else that would have been more satisfactory. It does pretty much what it claims. The breadbox is much handier to use than plastic bags, looks OK on the kitchen counter, and keeps bread fresh for 2-3 days, we've never had bread any longer. The slicing guide is a big help in slicing uniform 1/2"" slices. The slicing guide could be sturdier, but would probably be much more expensive. We have no complaint about the sturdiness of the breadbox."
5,Simply convenient -- long life with added care,"This is a simple plastic product -- that with care -- can last for years. To preserve the plastic and to prevent it from being cut when you slice down to the bottom of the bread, purchase a small cutting board for the bread to sit on -- while it is in this bread keeper. This keeper is really handy -- and when you use a sharp bread-cutting knife -- cutting home-made bread is no longer a chore. I recommend this product."
4,helps slice home baked bread evenly,"This is actually my second purchase of this product. The problem with the ""slicer"" itself, the white portion of the item, is that it will eventually break down after continuous use. After losing two of the ""teeth"", it became more difficult for me to get the size of slice i liked. So i went ahead and about another one. the cost is cheap, so I felt it was worth it. And now i have two plastic containers, and can be handy in the event i bake two loaves in one day."
2,needs a better guide,The holes in the sides of the keeper provide ventilation but the holes are so large that flies can (and do!) get inside the container. UGH!The cutting guide is flimsy and hard to use. Theoretically this product is great but in practice it is less than good.
3,Perfect slices,"I received the bread slicer and it look exactly as advertised. The slicing-spacer fixture fits inside the bread holder very nicely. The bread holder seems to keep the bread fresh for a few days. The only problem that I have with it is when slicing the bread, the slicing fixture slides all over the counter-top. It would be nice if it had a non-stick base or a handle. All in all, it is a good product. TGH"
2,Progressive Clear bread slicer/keeper,The hole on the end plate allows the bread to be squeezed out thus causing non-uniformed slices. The little holes on the box cause air to dry up bread also. Not very happy with the product.
3,Keeps Loaves Fresh,"The slicer guide isn't very sturdy, but the bread-box portion of the Bread Keeper keeps loaves nice and fresh. You could do worse, for the money."
4,I'm glad I purchased two.,I was tired of using gallon size ziplock bags for my fresh bread. I also like the slicer guide. The container is attractive but larger that I expected.
4,good storage/not so good slicer,I bought the clearly fresh bread keeper mainly because I wanted to have the slicing guide to ensure evenly sized slices of homemade bread. I was pleased with the keeper and have found that it is adaquate for keeping bread fairly fresh but was disappointed in the slicer because a) it is so flimsy that the guides moves as I am slicing the bread causing the exact thing I was trying to avoid...uneven slices and b) wasn't crazy for someone reason about the plastic material the slicer is made from and c) it's hard to hold the loaf toward the front of the guide without the entire unit shifting around as I'm trying to slice. Haven't found better yet though......
5,Useful Bread Storage,"It's expandable... my 1.5 and 2.0 pounds of homemade bread fit perfectly. It keeps the bread fresh for weeks. I just had a slice of 9-day-old bread and it was as fresh as day one. The slicing guide works very well. Yes, it's plastic, but it's a guide... the knife fits between the slots. It's easy to clean, and it looks good on the countertop. I looked around, and for $9.99, I am very happy with this product. Well worth the money."
2,not a good complement,Steams up and keep it wet. So the issue is soggy bread or mold. Can put in cold bread and should be okay
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this product to assist in slicing homemade bread evenly. The slicing guide is less than desireable. Since it is made out of plastic, it didn't take long to scar its surface while slicing the bread. I also found it not to be very sturdy, and was afraid I'd break it while slicing the bread. Also, you can only slice about 5 slices of bread before you have to remove the slices, and then move the whole loaf forward and start over. Improvements might be to create a base where the knife can slice through the bread and not the base and create a slicer guide that allows the user to slice an entire loaf at one time. I used this product about three times and abandoned its use. The breadkeeper is gathering dust. I keep bread in the refrigerator in a bread bag."
3,Not bad,"Everything works as it should, but it could definitely use some improvement. The container work s well for shorter loaves, but when placing a longer loaf in it you have to fully extend each half of the container. As a result, anytime you open the container to get some bread, crumbs will fall out and you also end up exposing half the loaf. The slicing guide works fairly well, but unless you have a really thin loaf of bread you won't be able to store the guide inside the container as the picture shows. Minor inconvenience I guess."
5,"EXCELLENT cage for Keets, Lovebird, Cockatiels","We bought three of these for our parakeets, lovebird, and cockatiel. Nice cages, very easy ti keep clean. Plenty of room for birds and their toys. Easy assembly too. For the price, you can't go wrong. We've had ours over two years now and no problems whatsover. Pretty nice looking too."
3,hot!! and tough,its ok jerky . . . nothing to rage about...comes in a silly package tho so i guess itd make a good gift to somone with all their real teeth
1,Get your body back and lose weight while breastfeeding,"It has great information, but not what I was looking for. I was actually very dissapointed. I was not looking for nutritional information. I was looking for how to lose weight (ie. samples for diets)."
4,OLD SCHOOL,"This is probably one of the best CD's released in 1999. Not bad for a bands debut. These guys play old school BLACK METAL. Like the good old days of IMMORTAL, touches of MAYHEM and a dab of old ULVER. They have taken the blueprint of old and given a fresh shot in the arm. Well played and executed."
4,Good Starter Book,"-The book gives an overall tour of technical writing. -Not all information will apply to everyone but is still good to have.-For the price this is a good book describing technical writing and related techniques.-A few typos in the book, but that is just nitpicky."
1,The title is degrading to professional technical writers,"I won't purchase any book that denigrates my profession by using terms such as ""idiot"" in the title. Idiots cannot write a technical manual. I'm sick of authors trying to make a fast buck by implying that even an idiot can be a technical writer."
4,Not Just for Tech Writers!,"""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Technical Writing"" is an excellent resource for communication managers and writers in all fields - while aimed specifically at technical writers, much of the book deals directly with the issues confronting project managers and writers across the communications spectrum. The advice concerning writing clearly, scheduling, managing the project, and document design, particularly in Parts 3 and 4, are practical, loaded with useful tips, concise, and readable. This book has a permanent place among the resources on my desk and I find I refer to it at least weekly - it is indispensable."
5,Useful and Easy to Read,"This is one of the best books on the field I have seen. It serves as a excellent overview of almost anything you need to know about the field, and its processes. I am finding it incredibly useful as a writer who is managing his first technical documentation project. In addition, the great page layout and font choices of this book is even more attractive than the ""Dummies"" series, making it an easy and quick read. This is important for anyone who is learning on the fly and on the job."
2,"powerful, but dilute","I agree with the reader from Chicago. This is a wrenching story of disillusionment and personal transformation, and a shocking look at post-graduate medical education. I found the author's inability to write easier to stomach, however, than his frequent bewildering digressions. I suggest just skipping the longer paragraphs all together- the one-liners hold most of the story's punch."
2,Even if it is true this book is very poorly written.,I am sure most doctors and nurses can testify to the contents of this book but it was so poorly written that I couldn't even finish it. It's full of ackward prose and unintelligible gibberish. It's very hard to find the real story because Shem's incompetency as a writer is very profound.
2,A Huge Disappointment,"Waited until after residency and fellowship to read this book. Amusing how many of the phrases have become part of the vernacular in medicine but, overall, the stories are painfully boring and redundant. This book is mostly of historical interest only. Wouldn't put it at the top of my ""must read"" list."
2,L-O-N-G,"Endless.... This book takes us inside a hospital, but its no fun. Long and boring, wait until there are ER books."
1,Disappointing,"I found the book ponderous and dull. The author's observations about the medical profession became progressively less interesting as he repeated them again and again. Despite Updike's praise, the flights of lyrical fancy were embarassing. The sex seemed tacked on and the humor fell flat for me (particularly the irritating dialogue between the docs and the cops). The book's main value may be to dispel readers' illusions about the medical field, as well as illusions about the pre-managed care era with its incentives for overutilization of tests, etc. Yes, the author intended to illustrate the monotony of a young physician's life, but when someone can do this AND write an interesting book, I'll give it some more stars."
2,only for medical freshmen,the author makes only a few good remarks on medical education and training. The books tries to hard to be humouristic and lacks the real cynicism and sarcasm that comes after a decade working in medicine.
2,A lot of work for the good parts,"I bought this book because I had heard many mixed reviews about it from people in the medical profession. I myself have found that there are a few nuggets of insightful commentary hidden amongst the sexist, racist, mindless, lewd and all together poorly written drivel which makes up most of the book. This being said, the book can be pretty funny at times, and might be worth a read for a laugh or two if you can stand all the pointlessly captalized words."
2,Too Cynical,"As a second year medical student, I had been told by many people that this was the book to read. However, I found the book too cynical and unrealistic. It was melodramatic at times as well, though it did make me laugh occasionally. I really just didn't care for the overall tone of the book."
1,"Long, repetitive, and lacks a plot...","I purchased this after a good friend who is an MD strongly recommended it - I work with doctors everday (although not a medical professional myself) so I thought this would give some interesting insights... I am on page 200 and simply can read no more! It is SO REPETITIVE and I am still waiting for the storyline to develop halfway through! It is killing me to not finish this book, but I think in the end it will be more painful to try to get through the next 200 pages. It is so bad, I think I will literally trash it so that I never have to be reminded of the time I wasted trying to read it..."
5,Must read for medical professionals,"This is a must read for any medical professionals, especially medical students who are deciding what specialty to enter. It is a legendary book in medical school, with good humors, lots of basic knowledge on the ways of medical education as well as give you an understanding on the pitfall of our medical system."
3,"Started strong, fell apart halfway through","The first half of this book was briliant. I finished my internship 10 years ago (before the rules limiting maximum hours that housestaff can work)and can truly say that it captured the essence of the experience. That being said, the book jumped the proverbial shark about halfway through the book with an orgy in the intern callroom. It all went downhill from there."
3,Mixed reaction,"HOG is a well known classic among us hospital folks. Shem captures perfectly the spirit of exhaustion, cynicism, and sarcasm that one finds among interns (and nurses and medics as well!). I agree with some of the previous reviewers who feel much of the sex in the book is gratuitous, and could have been left out without detracting from the narrative (plus, it doesn't really reflect reality)... A good read, but there's probably other books out there that deal with internship year (I just finished mine two months ago) that can be as insightful and revealing, without the dross."
5,Great Novel about the Problems Facing Doctors,"This novel is a candid often shocking account of a young doctor's year as a resident in a large New York hospital. The author is a professor at Harvard Medical school and a psychologist. His experiences provide a great basis for this novel which seems so real it is often difficult to believe it is fiction. The character development is excellent. The reader begins to love characters like the sagely ""Fat Man"" and the other young doctors and hate the bureaucracy that leads the doctors to disillusionment. Even if you do not really like medicine the book is interesting because it is a study of a unique psychological world. Shem's story draws the reader evokes powerful emotions. The story is quick moving and never dull the resolution is perfect. This is a masterpiece. It was so good I went out to buy Shem's other novel ""Mount Misery"" which was also good but lacked the energy and refinement of ""The House of God"""
5,Classic Medical Novel,"This is the classic medical novel which is considered ""required reading"" for anyone who wants to be a doctor. It's a very interesting, but sometimes disturbing read. As a doctor, I don't find that there is nearly as much sex in the hospital as House of God lets on, but maybe it's just that I'm not involved in it! Overall, a must-read for anyone in the medical profession.Sanjay Gupta's recent bookMonday Mornings: A Novelis a good companion to House of God from a medical fiction standpoint. These are the two medical novels I recommend to medical students and premeds."
5,Hilarious,"This is a must read for those who work as healthcare professionals. I read it before my third year in medical school. I laughed out loud repeatedly throughout the book. Many inside jokes are cracked on wards everywhere by students, interns, residents and staff physicians. This book, although containing controversial material, has become a part of medical culture. It definitely intertwines the practice of medicine with human instincts and volitions. If you're a physician or a medical student, and you haven't read this book...don't waste another second...buy it and become part of the culture.If you don't have experience working in a hospital, you'll probably find the book to be distasteful and unbelievable."
4,"A little out-dated, but good","I will be a first-year medical student this year, and after reading The House of God, I almost changed my mind! The author writes about the harsh side of medical training that most people either skim over or fail to mention at all. The characters are all very real, imperfect, and interesting. My only complaint is that someone should write an updated version of this story since the role of women and minorities as doctors has changed considerably since this novel was written."
3,The House of God,Having worked in an Emergency Department I found this book very funny and true to life. A quick read trying to make light of a serious subject.
2,Out of date,I found this book to old to really enjoy. I did not like the way the doctors and interns where portrayed.I just felt this book was not up to the quality I enjoy reading.Just like a B movie.
1,"It's disgusting pornography, not medicine!","This is not a book about medicine, which I hoped that it would be, but it's just pornography. Disgusting! The author should be ashamed of himself and I'm shocked that he's actually practicing medicine! Disgusting!!!"
1,Don't buy it!!,"An awful book, I am sorry I wasted my money on this ... macho ... book. I surely hope the doctors I see weren't like this during their internship. Gomers indeed!! I net when Dr. Shem is eighty he will feel differently."
5,Changed my direction,"I first read this masterpiece as a pre-med student in 1980. I enjoyed it, yet thought ""this can't be real"". It was too dark, too hilarious to be real. After discussing it with clinical interns and professors who were MDs, I learned how true-to-life it was. I still thought it was funny, sad, and heartwrenching at times but I no longer thought of it as untrue. So, I switched my major to Economics instead. A must read for everyone working in health care or using health care (basically everyone). I would also suggest the movie ""Article 99"" which seems to be based on this book."
4,"Perhaps a bit dated, but a Must-Read, nonetheless","I didn't read this book until I was a resident. The hospital I trained at wasn't anything like this in actuality, but the personalities, struggles, and oddities seem to be universal. A must-read for anyone in medical training."
3,realistic,I am a physician who completed a residency in Psychiatry. We had to do four months of medicine in our first year. The book is incredibly accurate with regard to the anxieties and fears that an intern has. These are too numerous to mention here. I'll probably never read the book again as those memories are too painful and I never want to go through that cruelty again. Being an intern means losing yourself; your patients become your life. I only gave it three stars because some parts of the book seem like verbatim copies out of Joseph Heller's Catch 22. Otherwise 5 stars for authenticity.
3,Interesting topic but poorly written,"This book gives you some sort of relief, if you work in the medical field (I'm a vet), because you can see, that you are not the only one terrified with the idea, that if you make a mistake or don't remember something, somebody is gonna die.It gives you some inner peace, but on the other hand, it has a lot of sexual scenes, that are completely unnecessary and out of place, and gives the book a taste of low class porno book.It also gives you the impression, that medicine is some sort of joke, that 95% of the treatments are useless and that your only escape from the ""joke"" is to become a psychiatrist, so you don't have to ""touch"" sick people anymore. It's just ridiculous!"
2,Not brilliantly written,"but it has a real ring of the ugly truth, heartbreaking and hysterically funny as it is. I read this book when my boyfriend (now husband) was in medical school and he swore that it is all true (with the exeception of the sex...so either 1) times have changed; 2) the author exaggerated; 3) he's protecting me). I would recommend this to anyone with a loved one in the medical profession--just to see where some of the frustration and cynicism comes from."
3,"This book isn't only ""set"" in the 70's - it was written then!","My first career was working in a county hospital as an administrative coordinator for a Family Practice Residency program and as the Credentialing/Privileging coordinator for all of the staff physicians there. What an eye-opener this book was for a then 20-something young woman fresh out of business school. My actual experiences never reached the base level that is described in this book but we were a small facility located in the San Francisco East Bay Area in the 'burbs.That being said, I think that there is a lot of humor, entertainment and enlightenment value to the book for interns/residents and attendings and the general public who should understand that doctors are human beings. They are not ""God-like"" and they become just as ""irreverent"" within their professions as Policemen, Teachers....er...Politicians do.I have read and re-read this book at least twice and I consider myself a fan of doctors in general.A fun read. Enjoy."
3,Great Book but out of date,"Great book which reflects medical training about 30 years ago.However, with the new emphasis on work hour regulations, an 80 hour week, no call, and relatively few American medical graduates going into the type of Internal Medicine training described in the book, it is kind of a fossil."
4,House of God,"I first read parts of this book when I was a young nursing student back in the 70's. While the references to technology are outdated, it still packs a punch as it describes the suffering of interns and patients. I do NOT like the sexual references to nurses but then again, thats the way thing were when this book was written. At least we are portrayed as being caring and smart. It gives a good overview of the maturation of our medical population as they go through schooling."
5,Great read.....,"This book is a classic. To be fair, it is a bit out-dated. Internship is not quite what it used to be....but many of the stories still ring very true. And, in any event, it is a great read in its own right. If you really want to know what internship is like, get ""Hospital Survival: Lessons Learned in Medical Training"" by Grant Cooper. But, for pure entertainment and a look at how internship was in the 1970s-80s, read House of God."
1,Worthless,"This is an out-of-date, highly fictionalized account of one person's residency. While it may be titillating for some people to read, if you believe these stories, you'll believe anything."
3,The House of God,"It was not what I totally expected (content). The book itself was in excellent condition and it was delivered quickly with a hand written note with hopes I would enjoy the book and found it in the condition advertized. The book just contained more graphics about personal situations, I did enjoy the thought process of how the patients were treated. Most medical personal would enjoy the care of patients that was described."
5,A MUST READ FOR ANYONE IN MEDICINE!! HILARIOUS!!,"This book is so clever and witty!! I am a third year medical student and after this book was suggested to me by many of my preceptors, i finally found some time to read it!!! If you love the TV series ""SCRUBS,"" then you'll LOVE THIS BOOK!!!"
4,GETTHEBOOKGETTHEBOOKGETTHEBOOK!,"As a medical professional (a nurse) I loved this book. The boyfriend (a 4th year medical student) and I both agree that this is as close as to the real world as anything else published. Medical people will love it for its dark and real-to-life humor. Lay people will hate it for the same reasons. If you have a significant other in the medical profession- read this book and you will only begin to understand our stories and our frustrations with our job. The boyfriend is giving it to his mom who has absolutely no idea what goes on in between the brick walls of a hospital to help her understand that we aren't calous about our work. When you DAILY work with others hovering over the edge between life an death, the strain can get to you if you can't laugh. And this book will make you laugh, even in its darkest hour."
1,"Bland, boring","Bertrice Small usually dishes up thrilling, exciting erotica but unfortunately this book is none of the above. Although well-researched, the couple isn't that interesting and the subplot with the French Revolution seemed more like filler than a genuine attempt at writing real adventure, and the scenes of rape/sexual abuse of prisoners was a major turnoff. Brutality stuff simply doesn't belong in a romance novel. Can't recommend this one."
1,A Dud.,I've always been a big fan of this author but I was terribly dissapointed by this book. It read as if someone had just taken a course on how to write a historical romance and was filling in the blanks. There was minimal tension between the heroine and hero and some of the love scenes were embarrasing to read as the dialogue was so laughable.
2,Unbelievably dull...would rather read a book about a nobody than these boring peers,"So bad...so boring...the heroine is too goody goody to be true and lacks the fire, spiit, sensuality, and mettle to be a true Small heroine. Asexual, and unerotic. The love scenes were shockingly tame, even dull. This is about as bad as The Innocent (another Small novel), save that this books lacks the villains and plot twists that are a hall mark of even the worst of Small's novels, giving her books a campy trampy edge if nothing else. She was going for sweet...but this is just plain milk toast, treacle. Not worth the money."
2,Not worth the time,"I absolutely LOVE Bertrice Small, but I was very disappointed by this book. The characters were so shallow that it was difficult to keep anyone but the main characters straight! There was no real adventure (unlike Sky O'Malley and family) and the French ""escape"" seemed thrown in to prolong the story. The feeling of undying love between Allegra and the Duke never conveyed itself in the reading."
3,"Not this author's best work, but an enjoyable read...","I am a huge Betrice Small fan, and many of her books have been so re-read by me that the bindings have broken. Her books are generally full of passion, historical suspense and strong, independent minded heriones.While this book mimics her usual genre, I can't say that this fan is impressed. I found the book predictable and actually fairly dull. That said, it was still an enjoyable read for a 'at the beach in the summer' book, though not one I'd recommend to a first time Bertrice Small reader. Try a Skye O'Malley series book first instead !I wanted to love this book, and I only wish that I had. Liking it was as far as I can give it, sadly."
4,I liked it,"I reserved this book at the local library as past books by this author made me unsure about spending the money on this new one. Well, I have to say that I enjoyed this one a great deal. Other reviewers have provided the plot outline, so I won't waste the space on it again, but I loved watching the relationship develop between the two main characters and the identity crisis that Allegra seemed to have and her coming to terms with it. A very satisfying book indeed and I'd love to see a sequel featuring Vanessa. This is another potential interesting character that Ms. Small could do great things with."
1,Definitely NOT her best,"I am a huge fan of Bertrice Small, but this is a pale imitation of her usual work. The relationship between Alegra and Quinton lacks spark, and there was no real plot to speak of. O.K., so they meet, marry for convenience, she refurbishes his estate, he comes to see her as his true love, and she finally admits she loves him. The rescue of a friend's French relatives from the Reign of Terror was just thrown in -- no big deal. There was definitely no mystery, intrigue, villain, exotic locale, etc. to spice this up. I miss the O'Malleys,the Leslies and the Wyndhams! Not a total bad read, but not for true fans of her novels. Better luck next time!"
4,Typically Bertrice,"This is a typical Bertrice Small adventure. It lacks the adventure that many of her previous books have had, but it was a book that could not be put down. Filled with her romantic exploits."
1,Forget this one,"Just a little rant here--if Ms. Small wants to write about the 18th c., she should do a little research. This novel is so full of mistakes that I wondered why she bothered. Readers shouldn't."
1,"Boring, tedious and a waste of money.","The one time I splurge on the trade paperback, I get the worst book I have ever read by Bertrice Small. The plot is lackluster, contains no love triangle or conflict that we have come to expect from this author. Everyone starts out happy, then they get a little sad because bad things are happening to others, but they're fine. Then they're happy again. Big deal."
2,Dissapointed about The Duchess,"I was very dissapointed with this book. It clearly had none of the exciting heroines of past books by Bertrice Small. Although I was happy to see the mention of the Kira Banking family, I thought that the main character Allegra didn't have any passion such as Jasmine Leslie or Skye O'Malley. It was sad that I had to return the book."
3,"Not up to par,...","I was disappointed with this book! The French adventure towards the end was boring and clumsy. The book did tend to drag a bit. Even the love scenes were not very exciting. Allegra reminded me too much of past characters. I really enjoy Bertrice Small's earlier work but lately, her recent works have been mediocore."
3,Nice Characters.. but wasn't this a bit predicatable?,I love all of Ms.Small's books but for some reason I thought that this was rather boring and for the first time.. I skimmed over the chapters rather than reading then fully. It wasn't bad.. but i dont think it is one of my favourites.
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I am a HUGE Bertrice Small fan but I have to say this is the most boring book I've ever read! I had to force myself to finish reading it, hoping something exciting would come up in the next chapter. Allegra is a spoiled brat who you just want to [hate]! Quinton should've used her money and dumped her! I was so disappointed and angry when I finished this book, I almost ended up burning it."
2,This story could have been so much more.,"Well, I just finished The Duchess. (More like a 1 1/2 star). I kept thinking or wondering if in fact Bertrice Small wrote this story. Not at all like her other books which I have read about 90% of so far. The only way you could tell she wrote it was the long descriptions of what people ate. Heaven forbid people ate like that. Well, I put off reading this book because of the bad reviews but I bought it at a store for $1.00 and I must say that is about all it is worth if that. Needless to say it was disappointing for a Bertrice Small book but I got through it and glad to be done with it so I can move on. If you have to pay more than $1.00 for this book I would not recommend spending the money. It was not an awful book but it could have been so much more. I really wanted to slap the little s--t by the end of the book."
2,Is Ms Small under contract?,"..that she keeps shelling out poor novels? Having read such marvelous works in the past (The Kadin, Skye O'Malley, etc.) I find myself continually disappointed in her current offerings. The Duchess is another failed attempt. It seems Ms. Small is running out of ideas for, as other reviewers suggest, the French Revolution seems tossed in for sake of lengthening the book. Bertie, get a fresh inspiration! Your readers are tired of the O'Malley clan and of spoiled little girls with too much money!The only saving grace is that our 'heroine' is not captured and sold into a harem, hence the 2 stars."
5,Now available in Waylon's 2CD Complete MCA Recordings!,"Finally!! I have always loved the Will the Wolf Survive album. I have just about worn out my cassette of it. For years I have looked high and low for this out of print jewel to no avail, but now MCA has finally released the 2CD set Waylon's ""The Complete MCA Recordings"" which contain the complete songs from the following 4 Waylon albums:1. Will the Wolf survive2. Hangin Tough3. A Man Called Hoss (Another I have searched long for!)4. Full CircleSo there you are, a great value and some great overlooked recordings!"
5,will the wolf survive,I always buy from you all I get the best servive this cd i would say to all buy this cd a great page in the recordings of waylon it shows how this man kept up to what his fans would agreed is what make waylon the outlaw in contry music his music well live for ever
2,DISAPPOINTED,I bought this CD for the one song and that's about all I got. This CD is lacking in my opinion. I would not recommend spending the $$ on it.
4,Good book,good read for new papillon owner - had what I needed & info was very useful. Would recommend . Happy buyer
4,Very Informative!,There was alot of interesting facts and tidbits in this book. It was informative but not opinionated.It was an indepth reference like that of an encyclopedia.I recommend for any new Papillon owner. Veteran owners should and will already have this basic knowledge.
5,Love This!,This was a very informative book about Papillons. It was especially helpful to me because I am a new owner of a Papillon and I learned a lot. It discussed a wide variety of topics from obedience to health issues. The pictures were wonderful and enjoyable also!
1,Disappointed,"Was very dissapointed. Did not think this book was as breed specific as other reviews claimed. Most advice seemed very generic. Housebreaking section was very limited and did not offer advice for difficult dogs. Also, another problem I was experiencing; teething, biting and chewing, was not even addressed in the book. Good for history of breed, but advice section was extremely limited. Would not recommend if you are looking for advice with various problems."
2,Not good quality.,"Looks nice in the picture and the price seems to be a deal, but, once received, it's not hard to see why the price is so low. The quality isn't really much better than rawhide - very thin and stiff. The dimensions given are external measurements so take about an inch to two inches off for internal. I also noticed a few minor flaws. When I tried to return the bag, amazon.com said I had to contact the seller. Made several attempts and couldn't get ahold of anyone and no one answered my emails. Shop around for better quality."
3,"Looks great, but function could be better","This bag looks and smells great, but in using it for the past 2 weeks I've noticed that it has a couple flaws. First, the strap never stays adjusted- I have to shorten it if I am walking for more than 5 minutes because it slips. Secondly, the way the bag closes is very cool, but unfortunately when you put it on, the two side hinges stick out and ruin the way it looks. I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to fix it, but I think it's just a fact of life."
2,dont buy,I bought this to be a gift and ended up keeping it because it was not that nice. It was already ugly and a little rusted when i got it. It worked okay but the sponge tore apart within the first couple of weeks of light use. I probably wouldnt buy something like this again. The replacement sponges are expensive for being so worthless. The sponges probably dont last long because you have to repeatedly crush them to get the soap out.
4,Senior Saints study,Book is excellent for Christians (individual or groups) growing older who need to find continued significance and value in what they do.
4,A must read for anyone who thinks money is the answer.,"Dr. Williams gives his wonderful insights to what made a poor boy from Georgia into one of the most powerful leaders in any healthcare profession. By emphasizing loving, giving and serving just for the sake of it out of your own abundance, this book acts as a guide to allow you to reach what you never thought possible."
5,Long term user of Soft Paws,"My mom and I got a cat when I was 14 (am now 26) and it wasn't too long after bringing this kitty into our home that we started using Soft Claws. Our vet recommended them as an alternative to de-clawing. We needed to do something, because kitty was taking unauthorized rides on our golden retriever's back. Playful, but painful for the poor dog. Mom has been using the claw covers for at least 10 years. The first application is a pain, especially with her cat turning into a total demon for nail clippings. But after that, they only tend to lose one at a time, and replacement is a cinch. We used clear ones for a long time, but it was hard to tell when she lost one. But with the pink ones (and a matching collar of course), it's easy to spot a bare toe. The cat has never seemed bothered by them, we haven't had any issues with her getting her claws stuck in stuff, and the dog/furniture remained scratch free."
3,Okay for training,"PROS:1)The soft paws were easy to apply and kitty didnt even notice they were on. 2)She didnt try to remove them and they look very cute.3)No scratching the kids anymore!!CONS: 1)As the nail grows out the soft paw allows for strings to get wrapped around nail and is very painful for kitty. I had to rescue kitty several times from rug strings, toy strings, blankets...ect.I would say soft paws are good for training kitty not to scratch, but I have decided not to continue using them. I'm not always home to rescue her from the string monster. I think its more humane than declawing, but still can be painful for kitty if she gets her claw almost ripped out because its stuck on the blinds."
2,Soft Paws Caused my Cat to Injure Herself,"I heard so many good reviews about Soft Paws, I just had to try them for my cat. I applied them with the glue given in the package and she seemed to tolerate them well for the first hour or so. I went to work that day, came home and found her poor little claws mangled and ripped to the quick from her spending the entire day ripping the soft paws off of her claws. I kept finding them all over the floor with ripped out fur stuck in them from the glue. I felt so horrible and will never use them again. If you're going to use Soft Paws, you might want to try it out with a less permanent glue first to make sure your cat won't injure itself."
1,Wish I could rate this ZERO stars!,"Horrible! As another reviewer has stated, these nail tips work fine when first applied. After just a couple days of having them on, and the nail beginning to grow, my cat managed to catch his nail in the lace edging of my rather expensive bedding. 'Rags' couldn't free himself, nor could I extricate the nail ........ ended up having to cut the bedding. Just a few moments ago, it happened for a second time, only this time he wrapped his leg around one of the vertical supports to my brass bed and was hanging off the side by the caught nail! Again, had to cut the expensive bedding!Poor 'Rags' nail is so sore now from this last episode. Soft paws? They can keep them!"
1,Caps get caught all the time!,"I bought this product for my 3-month-old kitten. They were easy to apply (I glued them on while she was napping) and she didn't even notice they were there when she woke up. They were very effective for preventing scratching. HOWEVER, we have many rugs with looped carpeting and she gets her nail caps caught in the loops several times every day. I was only able to work her claw out two times.....the other 20+ times I have had to cut the yarn in the rug to get her out. Just a few minutes ago she got caught (for the second time in less than one minute) and she started rolling around and got her arm twisted behind her in a way that makes me wonder how she may have injured herself had I not been right there to help her. Now I worry every time I have to leave her alone because I'm afraid she will hurt herself. I can't get the caps off (I tried nail polish remover)."
3,soft paws review,"If your cat doesn't take the caps off then, they stay on for awhile. I tried them on my two cats and my older cat was not having it and took them all off. It will work best if you can allow the glue to dry for about 10min. so that means you have to make sure your cat doesn't bite them off."
3,"Eh, they're okay...","I've never had the problems when the claw starts growing out that others have had, however, my cat hates them, and immediately sets out to chew them off. My concern is that the Krazy Glue used to apply them is toxic to her as she's chewing and licking - intent on removing them. But I must say I don't put them on her because she scratches my furniture, it's 4:12am and I put them on her so I can SLEEP!!! Every morning about 3 or 4am, she's at the front door, scratching and meowing me to DEATH!!! I am a law school student who gets no sleep as it is, and I am at my wits END with her. I must say, when I put these on... forget about her not damaging the door - she's so CONSUMED with trying to get them OFF that I can FINALLY lie down and SLEEP. *shaking head* If you do try them, I would suggest that one uses them from the time they're kittens, because some cats might not care, but others - like this one on my living room floor - will HATE THEM."
4,I almost got rid of my cat until...,"My cat has a personal affection for toilet paper. No kidding, he loves to shred it up into iddy bitty pieces. Probably his way of getting revenge when I lock him in the bathroom to keep him from harrassing company. When he got his claws in my neighbors toupee and ripped it off his head I almost died of embarassment. He won't stop shredding toilet paper, and yes I put it out of his reach, he is like a Barnum and Bailey's acrobat , that one is!!! He also likes to eat toothpaste.I almost had enough, was gonna have him declawed. Until someone told me about these claw attachments. They are glued on the nail and it doesn't hurt your cat. Save your sofa and your nerves and get this product.."
1,Great...IF they stayed on,"I bought these for my cat two days ago and we are on day three. I applied the Soft Claws to her front nails (4 to each foot) and held her the requisite five minutes to allow proper drying time. She ripped two off the first day, two the second day, and three today. It seems to me that if this product did its job then they would not be able to come off so easily. What a disappointment and waste of money."
2,Not for every cat. Lots of pain with mine.,"I've tried this product several times over the course of several years with different cats and have always had the same results. The glue is not effective for more than a few days and once the nails start to grow, the more active cats have problems getting caught in toys, furniture, linens, etc. Even the less active of my cats has caught a nail in the bedding where she slept. I found that the old fashioned nail trimming with regular human nail clippers was by far the most effective and painless way of keeping the nails at bay. It took less time, and one trip to the vet for guidance on how to properly trim nails for this to work. I suffer no pain from sharp claws, no furniture damage, and I have NEVER cut to far. I am always very careful when doing this as it is easy to cut too far and cause severe pain and bleeding in the nail. But overall, this ""old-fashioned"" method gave me the results I wanted, and the caps gave me grief and the cats pain and irritation."
3,Truly bizarre,"Trust me on this--you ain't ever heard anything else like ""Re-Creation of the Gods."" You may not ever want to, either. Even as a fan of both jazz and the pipes, it took me several (widely-spaced) listening sessions to get through this disc all the way and, unfortunately, the audio quality did not help at all. This is one of the worst-produced discs since the early days of CDs.As for the music, well, you're either going to love it or wish to god for your fifteen bucks back; it's hard to say which. This certainly is not a CD for someone without a wide-open musical mind. I would place myself in that category but , still, I don't find myself spinning this disc very often.If you're the daring type, you might give it a try. Otherwise, it's not the choice for you."
1,"Funky, but poor sound makes this a waste of money","As with so many reissues (er...bootlegs?) of soul, funk and jazz LPs these days, the tapes are unavailable for a multitude of reasons. Regardless, I am sick to death of being fleeced with this kind of rubbish. Transferred from a poor copy of the vinyl LP, with absolutely no attempt made to restore a distorted, crackly mess.The music? Couldn't check out much of it, though I really liked what little I could bear to listen to. Looks as if I'm going to have to shell out for the original LP, then."
3,Gotta love Broken Lizard,"I'm a huge fan of Beerfest and Super Troopers, and I even liked Slammin' Salmon. That said, I think that you really have to be a fan of Broken Lizard to appreciate this film. Even then, it doesn't measure up to their other work. I always thought it would be awesome to combine a horror flick and a comedy flick, like some sort of concoction from a mad scientist's lab. Turns out I was wrong. The effect really isn't all that awesome...in that the humor is diluted and the horror is silly (so neither triggers much emotion). All in all, not a terrible film if you're a fan of these guys and can appreciate the humor that comes simply from watching them do their thing. If you've never seen their other movies, you're going to be left wondering how this project even got off the ground. Even Broken Lizard fans would be hard-pressed to want to watch it more than once, though."
2,Poorly Made Expensive Replacement Heads,"While the Cuisipro cleaning tool product itself is heavy duty and durable, the replacement scrub sponge heads are poorly made, too expensive and the green pad comes off and apart rather quickly and easily. More Corporate Executives should use their own products to see how poorly they are made and perform!"
2,Green scrubbie part falls off,"After moderate usage, the green scrubbie portion of the head fell off. There was a yellow sticky residue remaining. This got all over the dishes I was washing. Not pleased with product."
5,"Terrific! Terrific! Terrific! A perfect gift for any child. (Or adult, for that matter.)","This CD is jam-packed with great stuff. The songs are both hilarious and informative, and I cannot say enough about the performances. While every bit of the singing is truly great, the orchestration of the music is UNBELIEVABLE! Any one of the songs could be a legitimate top ten rock 'n roll hit.The songs are so catchy, you'll be whistling ""Employee of the Month"" and ""Where's Gary?"" all day long.This CD is really great, and I highly recommend it for kids of all ages. Including adults."
5,"Great Book, teaches compassion and understanding","This book is a great book, whether you are into the Buddhist beliefs or not. It teaches so much about relationships, understanding others and being able to calm ourselves when needed. It teaches how to deal with anger with our children, spouses, or anyone. It can help in you home as well as in a work environment. It can create peace in our lives, calmness, less stress, which I believe would help just about anyone. I would recommend you read it with an open mind and heart and you will get something out of it. I believe there is something for everyone."
2,not the best,"This lamp was not what I expected it to be. It was very light weight, easily knocked over, and it used a 40-watt bult, not a 70 watt bulb as indicated in the description of the item. It's basically an accent lamp, not the reading light I hoped for. When I called him, the seller indicated that although the lamp read 40 watt, I could safely use a 60 or 75 watt bulb. When I did not go for this, he wanted to send me another lamp at no charge so I would have 2 lamps and twice the light. I refused this since I wanted only one BRIGHT lamp. The seller was very accomodating in the return of the item, however, and refuned the full amount plus shipping."
5,Vey Handy,"These ""Little Ladles"" are very handy and look good enough for either kitchen or table use. perfect for sauces or gravies. Hard to find items."
1,Angle of handle is all wrong.,2 out of the 3 handles have broken on these ladles. The angle of the handle doesn't allow you to empty the ladle fully. I can not recommend these ladles.
3,nice ladles but no size labeling,"since the set is 3 handy sizes for adding measured amounts of liquids, I had expected the volume would be on each ladle the way any set of measuring cups is marked. These are not labeled in any way. If you remember the three sizes they come in (can you right now without looking back up?) then you can tell which one is which, but I don't see why I should have to memorize the size of ladles. However the welding of the ladles seems fine to me, so I guess I got a better set than another reviewer."
4,unfortunately real,"When I studied creative writing, I got furious with my teacher who praised my verisimilitude. What I had written was true, damn it! He explained that that didn't matter. All that mattered was whether the reader believed it.From the reviews I read here, some readers didn't believe Bill's plot. To me, as a computer security architect, the only thing unbelievable was the array of defenses Bill hauled out. I hope our military has such defenses. We in the commercial world don't.On the other hand, the attack scenarios were all believable, to me as someone in this field, and many of these attacks have been demonstrated already.So, I recommend this book to friends in the computer security business as an attack scenario that we need to design against. Designing against attackers less capable than these is folly, IMHO."
2,I was disappointed,"I learned about this book from an online mailing list for network administrators and I bought it hoping for a mix of Clifford Stoll and William Gibson. Instead it is closer to a combination of John Wayne and Austin Powers (minus his mojo and Michael Meyer's sense of humor). Very little technical detail and a plot that is thin, simplistic and filled with unbelievable events. I do agree with most of the other reviewers that it is an easy-reading page turner (good for a transatlantic flight) but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone seeking an intro to cybersecurity at anything but the most basic level. As for the romanticized vigilante politics, the less said the better."
1,horrendous,A friend met the author at a book signing and wound up purchasing the book. After he read it he passed it on to me (God knows why).This was terrible -- the kind of thing that gives self-publishing a baaaaad name. The plot is really unrealistic and the writing is amateurish at best. Lots of overused metaphors and adjective-heavy description. The author often slips into the passive voice and the editing was substandard. I slugged through this garbage (don't ask me why). Save your money.
4,could not put it down,"I have to say that this is the first biography I've read all the way through. It is like a Danielle Steel novel, although probably not as detailed. As a student of art history I thought this was a very interesting take of the New York Dada movement, where the Baroness was the first to do ""ready-mades"" before Marcel Duchamp. Overall I thought it was wonderfully written, and very interesting."
4,"Thank you, thank you...","I just need to thank who ever wrote this book, I love it, love it, love it.I recently made the whole wheat bread with the light syrup that I ordered from one of the suppliers that can be found in the book. What a darn good bread that was, I mean it tasted like bakery style bread. Yet, I have never tasted anything like it, I am thrilled that I picked up this book. I really do recommend this book to anyone that loves bread.Now I am just going to continue making more discoveries through out this fantastic cook book."
2,Weak book,"Not a very good book, it could have been written better. Much of the subject matter is in conflict with other books concerning this subject. Extremely redundant. Many of these Vietnam books are only different because of their covers. In short- there are many Vietnam books out there but there are only 6 or 7 that are worth reading. I am sorry but this isnt one of those."
3,Interesting but not as good as I was expecting,"Too many army-buzz words which meant I kept having to flick to the back to look them up. Some of the stuff was interesting, some just stock Vietnam War novel pulp that you can find in any number of accounts these days."
5,Very nice piece of literature about the LRRPs in Nam,"Larry Chambers is a very literate author, and a true veteran of the LRRPs in Vietnam. This book is very informative, and full of interesting facts about the patrols which were undertaken. also excellent glossary with hand signals amongst other things which really help!"
4,Good book to teach younger readers.,"This book was a bit simplistic, but it is certainly a good way of teaching younger readers about what it is like to be a migrant family."
2,Flat magic,"As an Argerich fan, I was eager to hear this new release, then disappointed when I heard it. Although there's nothing wrong with Martha's contribution, the compositions leave a lot to be desired.For a sense of where Rabinovitch is coming from, take one part Kabalevsky, two parts Camille Saint-Saens, one part Hanon, and stir in a little Philip Glass. While they are well recorded and expertly performed, these compositions are of limited interest. Trying very hard to be pretty, Rabinovitch uses ostinato to excess, driving melodic fragments into the ground. There is some variety but no development of the musical ideas. The title piece is a twenty-five minute gloss on ""Aquarium"" from Carnival of the Animals, and the next draws heavily on ""Persons with long ears"" from the same source, again drawn out. Finding the other sources for these pieces isn't hard but that quickly becomes tiresome. It is about all I can think of to do with this music. I wish there were more to say."
2,Solar lighthouse that won't come on at night until you hit the top of it!,"I would not recommend this product. The perches are too close for bigger birds to use, the bird feed can't come out properly, and, if it rains, very poor drainage. I am using it as yard art, and, every night, in order for it to come on, I have to tap the top of the lighthouse! Plus, it doesn't come with a hook at the top, so you can't hang it, and, no post comes with it. The cardinal in the picture cannot be real!!!"
3,Ole Reliable,"This workout is good for the days that you have a down day. The workout is short, direct, and to the point. The cueing is excellent. The impact is low and the intensity is high (if you are not use to working out). This is a good stand by tape."
2,Tastes like paste,"These may be healthy, but you'll have to force yourself to eat it. It tastes like paste with some fruit. I would give them one star, but I give them some credit for trying to make something healthy."
2,Good Tasting bars but near expired from amazon!,"Soft, chewy, a little grainy but a good flavor. Mine were expired a week after I bought a whole 12 pack :(Don't expect whole berries. Basically everything is ground together. Odwalla bar is much better. Definitely try the spirelina balls, though a little bit of a green flavor the energy/ginsing one is well worth the cost here- And NOT almost expired..."
4,Berry Good!,"This is one of the better bars I have eaten.If you take small bites and enjoy it,it's almost like eating a blueberry muffin."
2,Should have been good...,"The relationships didn't 'pay off'. Interesting conflicts that could have happened, didn't. The ending completely fell apart, as people who should have been present and deeply involved, weren't. Concept was great, animation was great---it was the story that just---wandered offstage in confusion. And getting at the Japanese language option took an act of Congress."
2,"Nice when new, but grip disintegrates and feels oily over time.","I own a couple of these Paper Mate PhD pens and also a couple of the main competitor, the Pilot Dr. Grip. Both of them are about the same in writing comfort, and the OEM ink cartridges are fine. The PhD refill are metal and more expensive, vs. the Dr. Grip refills are plastic and less expensive. The problem with the PhD pens is that the black rubber (synthetic?) grip disintegrates over time. It also seems to absorb the oils from your skin and develops an oily film. It feels a little gross using an ""old"" pen. On the other hand, the Dr. Grips have a white silicone grip that feels like new even after many years."
4,smooth,Ink doesn't last as long as I expected it to..but writes beautifully and extremely smooth. I would recommend this product.
5,relief,No more writers cramping. I lost one just like this when I sold my car. It was left in the glove box.
2,Doesn't last,"Yes, this is a fine pen. I especially like the grip. But my pen died in six months, and when I opened it to insert a refill, the pen came apart. The spring apparently jammed, and I had to throw the entire thing away. One expects more from Papermate."
1,They no longer stock this item!,"I'm not sure why this product is still being sold on Amazon? I ordered 3 of them, and then several days later received a letter saying they no longer carry this item."
5,Great Pen,We use these pens do to severe arthritis in our fingers. PaperMate PhD is very comfortable and urge those with this medical problem to try this pen.
3,Nice Photography - Poor Story,"While the photography used in making this movie is very impressive, the story line they used to tie it together was too forced. It seems the story was developed to utilize the camera images they had already filmed. Otherwise, an interesting piece. Also, I am not sure why Amazon's title says ""Stacy Keach"" and the DVD cover credits ""David Ogden Stiers"" as the narration."
2,Not really good,"The quality of the picture is not really good which is expected due to its published date of 1980 or something. But I was interested in the informational part of the DVD and when played, I was very dissatisfied. This was not worth buying...look for something else. This DVD is not good."
2,Really Weird,"When I bought this memory card, I thought i was getting a great deal. I did get a good deal, but when i opened the package, the memory card looked a little ""fatter"" and on the back it said ""made in china"" and the colors were slightly different. If you look at the memory cards that came with your PS2 the mem card says ""made in japan"" on the back and is much thinner. The memory card will not be recognized by my ps2 50% of the time, and the other 50%, it makes my ps2 freeze. I do not recomend this product....just go to best buy or any store and buy it from there."
1,Bum Memory Card,"This product didn't work. My playstation 2 couldn't detect the card. It did; however, detect my nephew's card and the one I had to buy from Wal-Mart because the one I purchased here did not work."
4,Memory Card- Great Gift,"this was a gift for my son...he loves it. it did already have some data saved to it, but it was easy enough to delete and make room for my son's data. I would recommed."
4,Memory Card works great,Memory Card allows game saving capability for multiple players. Our kids were excited to not have to start over every time they play a game.
5,Memory Card,"Well, its not a game, so I can't rate it for how fun it is. I don't know why they asked that. But the memory card works well. It works better than the generic kinds do, because there are several games that I have that will only work with the Sony memory cards...yay sony."
3,A necessary evil.,"If you don't want to start the game from the beginning every single time, you need a memory card, plain and simple. And this one, being it's got the lable on it that it is made for the playstation 2 by the Sony company (the company that makes the PS2), I'd say it's a good buy. I have three of them, however, one is no longer mine, it was a gift, but the point is it works."
2,Fabric not so good,"This item looks great on line, and the colors are true. However, the fabric is rather cheap-o, and the fit doesn't hug the body, sort of gapes at the lumbar, not so flattering. Not sure if I'll ever wear it."
2,Poor quality control,"No problem mounting these to the wall, and the frequency response is adequate for the ambient music in our dining room. One of the terminal posts was stripped, however, necessitating a messy soldering job. There isn't always the time to mail something back or engage in arbitration. Time is money, time is life. It shouldn't be that hard to assemble such a simple product correctly, and inspect it before it goes out the door.Another case of 'Made in China' inattention to detail. They just don't understand real capitalism yet, do they?"
3,Not sure if tis is good,My ghecko does not eat it. Not sure why. I suspect its because it eats only live food. I have a regular gecko I found in the wild in florida.
2,Book ordered from Amazon,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. When I wanted to look up verbs (English to Latin) that were not in the present tense, there was no entry, even one that would direct the reader to that Latin verb in the present tense. It left you wondering how to find the proper Latin version of the English verb."
5,Excellent Resource,This edition replaced my Cassell's paperback editon & I'm very pleased with my selection. It's an excellent resource and very user friendly.
1,Leaked!,These pens leak!!! I tried every one of them and each one leaks. I don't know if it's just a defective batch that I got or what - but I found it impossible to not smudge EVERYTHING when using them.
5,Love these pens.,"I brag about these pens to everyone. I write all the time. Not only do I write novels with these pens, but essays as well. I have been writing with these pens for so many years, I can't remember writing with any different brand of pen."
3,Did Not Like!,"These pens might be great to some but I was disappointed. They did not write smooth and the ink was not the same bold, bright colors displayed. I gave them to some children to use. They liked them. Maybe I am hard to please."
5,The best pens EVER!,"I bought these pens to take notes in my math class this term. They write very smoothly and after 24 hours of note taking they are still working fabulously! I love the different colors especially for math. I am able to write out the problems, the explanation, and the answer in different colors which makes it all easier to understand later. They also helped to keep me focused even in a class that didn't get out til 10 pm!!! A definite must!"
2,price,"why are the prices going high!? alot of people dont want that,now it is harder deciding between these or other pens"
5,Favorite Pens Ever,Love these pens - they write smoothly and beautifully! Never want to use any other pens. These pens will last you a very long time - just don't let people borrow- you might not get them back!
5,Did you think you had a great vocabulary?,"Just wait until you read George Bradley. He's standing on the shoulders of Webster's Unabridged. He picks great words and then darn if he doesn't know how to put them together. If you've got your heart set on reading poetry that will give you chill-bumps, this book is the one to buy."
5,my mom loved them,"My mom loved them. What more can I say? They look great on her. She's happy, and that made me happy."
5,extremely hard to stop listening to this album,"this must be the best album of various band imitations i've heard. depending on the track, they sound just like early Pink Floyd, with lots of melodic 'ba, bap ba ba ba' style background vocals. or the Kinks. or just like Jesus and Mary Chain with swaying, simple bass lines, hovering feedback & muted vocals. or Velvet Underground, Swell, etc.in fact, they are basically ripping the sounds right off these artists- which would be a bad thing if the songs weren't so unbelievably good.my only gripe has to do with the poor sound engineering job that was done on track 9. whoever mic'd the drums (the tom in particular) really blew it. first of all it's horribly out of tune and secondly it's so overdone it drowns out the rest of the song. this is the only complaint i have however, and it might not even be the band's fault.overall i'd say go buy this album, it's terrific."
3,el goodo...,"el goodo is more okay than good. it was background music, not bad not good... just kind of there."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Performs as expected... mediocre. Not the best choice for a dobsonian, where lens length is typically not an issue."
3,Lens,We are neutral about this lens probably because we are new to using telescopes and have no clue what we are doing.
3,Good for most uses,"This will be a good product for most applications, and is very convenient for lighter scopes. Works just fine in my Meade ETX-90. But shows its weakness, as all less expensive eyepieces do, in a very high quality refractor (Stellarvue SV80S). Consider the short Antares 3X Barlow, or the more expensive Orion 2X, if you have a scope with very hiqh quality optics, or might upgrade to it."
3,It's Ok.,"I bought this piece for my Orion SkyQuest 4.5 Dobsonian. Overall I would have to say I'm a little bit disappointed with the product. The view through it is inferior to that of a standalone Plossl lens, and it is difficult to focus detail out of it even at lower magnifications. That being said it isn't totally useless, as I have been able to see the polar caps on Mars on a very clear night."
4,Nicely priced barlow for beginners to intermediate.,"So far I have enjoyed this barlow lens that I purchased with a 5"" reflector. Works very well with the 2 eyepieces that came with my scope. The short length is nice with a 7 element eyepiece (6mm) I got later that is quite long itself. For the price, it's a good deal. For quality though, I would consider the Shorty Plus as it's fully multi-coated and has a larger aperture (but ~ 2x more $)."
5,Fantastic,"A fantastic way to boost magnification. It fits perfectly with my telescope, and it's easy to switch lenses out on it. Anchors on the top of the shorty allow me to turn my eye piece around, and the images are as clear as they can be (I believe that my 6mm lens is dirty). I hope to see Jupiter's Big Red Spot with it!"
5,Does exactly what it's supposed to do,"Very clear, good FOV, doesn't significantly reduce apparent brightness, good mechanical fit.Works well with theZhumell 1.25 Inch 8-24mm Zoom Telescope Eyepiece"
3,"Good, but...","It's a pretty basic cooking utensil, but it is missing the large one. Got to mediums and a small. Oooooops."
1,junk,The watch quit working in under 2 weeks. First it would an hour or two a day. Then it quit all together. Piece of junk.
3,Bad chain,The watch by itself works. But I bought this watch specifically for the chain for use with another watch of similar design.Due to the fact that it is very difficult to get particular types of pocket watch chains online especially of colors other than sterling silver I decided to buy the watch.but the chains hook that connects to the watch bent when trying to un-clip it and it ended up braking off when I removed the chain from the watch. very disappointingBut If I could rate them separately I'd giveThe Watch: *****The Chain: ****
4,Zen Vision M accessory - hard to find,"It can be hard to find accessories for non-IPODs but this is a good one. I have the pink Vision, so it matched, and I liked that. I noticed that there are other colors availible from the seller also.Overall, it is a good product, it fits on my arm well and does not leave any marks like some armbands do.My only complaint is that the player fits in so tightly, it is almost impossible to take in and out. And the top part is completly open, so the front sometimes folds over and leaves the screen unprotected. I use a rubber band to hold it shut."
1,Silly and not very useful,"I'm amazed such a serious subject is given this cutesy treatment, but then, this is just the sort of book educators love to write. Nothing really practical here, just sweet little anecdotes about kids who fight over the swingset at recess and inner musings of the author on how much he ""admires"" the passion of abused children. The format is about one paragraph per page, so if you're looking for detailed instruction and explanation, this book ain't it (it's also a shameful waste of paper). A nice book for those who want to keep the subject clean and simple, but not recommended for those who desire real information or understanding. Silly and slightly insulting."
1,Don't Buy,I was looking for a book on solo scuba diving and found this one. To say I am disappointed is an understatement. The book rambled on about nothing. It spoke at length about justifying diving solo but when it came to specifics information was lacking. I have heard the TDI manual is better. I would look for that.
5,The White Collar Weapon of Choice,"I make my living with words--both written and spoken. Although adept with the word processor, letters must be signed, notes must be made and drafts must be edited. Nothing surpasses a nice rolling writer for making a distinctive mark. There is nothing subtle about this .4mm pen. Why mar a finely crafted letter on your best letterhead with the mark of a .25 cent bic pen? Furthermore, a signature from a blue ink pen insures that you will never mistake a copy for an original.To be sure, a $500 fountain pen makes its own statement both about the time and resources of its user. However, for those of us in the trenches who cannot suffer a misfire and who do battle away from the home desk in various court and conference rooms, the Rolling Writer is the weapon of choice. Unless I have a box within reach, I feel uneasy and ill-prepared."
4,Rolling Writer,"Good Pen to write with, but sometimes the metal ball comes out and it doesn't work after that. Despite the fact that the pen's metal ball were remarkably cheap, the Pen is surprisingly good.Ballpoint pens are made to order in mass quantities so the quality of pen components are not checked during all manufacturing stages.All in all, the Pen is flawed but uniformly good. Admittedly it would have been stronger if they'd followed the original pen manufacturing process more closely."
4,Great Pen,Its a great pen.Every so often one unit will have a problem or the tip might fall off.But over all i love these pens.
3,Blobs,"I love the smooth and bold flow of this pen, and how quickly it dries, but it has a tendency to blob and seep through paper. You won't be able to both sides of paper in most notebooks with thin paper."
5,Great pen,"For the price, these pens are a great deal and are high quality. I haven't ran into any issues besides the pens drying out after being in a pocket all day, but the dryness only lasts a couple seconds before it's possible to write with them again. The bold black ink gives me a love for writing and makes my writing look better than the, ""chicken scratch"" effect most people get with ballpoint or even some gel pens. Will definitely buy these again once my dozen runs out of ink or they get stolen.(These pens are the type that write good, but look good enough that nobody would steal them.)"
1,Don't waste your money,This product does separate the fat BUT small bits of meat or vegetables will stop up the spout and the plastic is not heat resistant. Mine cracked the first time I used it and after the second use it had to go in the trash can.
1,Cracked after two uses,Not heat resistant - this is just to substantiate the other reviews - item cracked after second use.
1,$8 for a scrap of plastic that can't go in the dishwasher?!?,"Unacceptable! Like others have written here, mine snapped in the dishwasher after the second use. I complained to the company and was told that the box instructs ""hand wash only."" Plastic that can't go in the dishwasher? Meant to separate boiling liquids but not dishwasher safe? For $8? Garbage!"
4,A Nice Book of Cable Knitting Patterns,"This book has some nice cable knit patterns. It is definitely a book for intermediate and experienced knitters. There is no technique section so knitters should have experience with cables and aran knitting projects previously.I appreciate that directions are written out as well as charted. Also, each pattern has a diagram so it is clear how the finished project is pieced together.There are projects for adults and children. Most of the patterns are for sweaters but there are shawls, scarves, and some household items included.I recommend this book."
1,disappointing and pretentious,"As an experienced knitter (35 years+) this book should be just right for me but I was very disappointed. The graphics and print are very hard to read. Schematics are very tiny. I'm not interested in a life philosophy of knitting, but in cables. Yarns are mainly Canadian so lack of more information on yarns needed and gauge is critical and lacking.Gauge is given over the cable pattern instead. If I knit anything here, I would have to redesign each one first. Why knit the scarf in two halves? No explanation given. One sweater uses I-cord at the bottom but no advice on how to knit without those i-cords. Best projects are for little kids. Not recommended. Buy the new Szabo book instead."
2,"They forgot it wasn't an ""art"" book","I was deciding whether to purchase this book and was reviewing the patterns--I'd look at the picture and think, how the heck am i supposed to figure out what it will look like from the ""artfully"" blurred image? or what does the bottom look like? since it is cut off in every image. Then I'd have to look at the sizes to figure out who the pattern was for, they didn't say anything so gauche (and useful) as ""child's"", or ""men's"" sweater. But still I kept looking, and discovered the final sin-they list the numeric size of the the yarn used, and the grams of the type of yarn used, but don't bother to add the meters. Granted I can do research online and eventually find our the meters myself, BUT IT WAS IN THEIR HANDS! all they had to do was look at the skein. they will not be getting my money just so I can suffer through a badly conceived book"
3,Nice book but not so stunning patterns,"I bought this book for one pattern I saw with a friend. It is a nice book, the photographs are nice. But the patterns are not really stunning or special and a bit dated."
2,Not so Hot,"I am currently using this book in a class on XML. It has been used sparingly, thank God, by our instructor. The main book we rely on for good advise and examples of XML is written by Elizabeth Castro. If you don't want to waste your money on a book which is not very clear, concise, or written in a well defined and orderly manner, don't purchase this book. I have worked in the field of computer programming and written in 9 different computer languages, as well as, learning others. Take it from me, there are better books on this subject."
2,Frustrated with Examples and Coding errors,After reaching module 3 I became quite disappointed. The example in Module 2-1 is missing from the website and there are many coding and errors in the examples through out the book making it hard for a new comer to really learn what is right or wrong. Unfortunately there aren't many books out there for beginners. For a true new comer to XML and coding itself this book can be confusing. Would recommend at risk.
3,Disappointed,This book started out very promising. Explaining things at a high level. I have not found a book yet on XML that has actually given me any insight on using it for anything useful. After reading this I am more confused than ever. The basis of XML is simple but the options and implementation are very hard to grasp.The main problem other than the typos throughout the book is the order. The author will be talking about one topic and go into another unrelated topic without ever finishing the first. Sometimes I had to check to see if I accidently skipped some pages.(I had not!!)Still looking for the best book to learn XML. This one wasn't it.
3,"CAUTION: Not really a ""beginner's guide""","The book does a good job with explaining topics such as using XML as a database and using DOM to interface with XML. It is also a good book if you work in the Microsoft web technologies (ASP, VBScript), since many of the examples use ASP and VBScript to interface with the XML document.However, I had to give it only three stars because it is not really a book for people new to programming, as this book advertises. A reader does need some kind of programming basics to understand some of the topics. Also, I think that the book glosses over the basics of XML. Even though the more intermediate topics like using XML as a database are explained well, a reader that is brand-new to XML could easily get lost because not enough emphasis was placed on the basics.If you do work in the Microsoft technologies, and you want to learn and work with XML, then buy this book AFTER reviewing the free XML tutorial on [website]"
2,what code?,"just a warning- don`t be convinced by the ""free code online"" offer- they don`t give you a website, and if you do track it down from the publisher, you`ll discover its painful to use- that combined with the mistypes in the text and its a basket case.other then that, the book is clear enough, but how can you learn a language without practice?"
1,A waste of time,"This book went to the presses to soon. Every example is full of errors. Every example is lacking and fails to show what it is intended to show. To add to my frustrations, online resources are not updated either. There are far too few illustrations. Far too few cross references. I would recommend ""The XML Companion"" by Neil Bradley, Addison Wesley. Just flick through the books side by side for 10 seconds and you get what I mean."
2,Good for you-not so good taste!,"The taste is not so bad the first few seconds of chewing, but by the time you swallow it, it's very strong with a lingering aftertaste. I'll need a few gallons of milk to wash these bars down! Maybe it's like Mom said, ""If it tastes bad, it's got to be good for you!"" Gee, tangerine/chocolate SOUNDED so good :("
4,"Excellent book, tough sledding at times","Shortly after this book came out I took it with me to a conference. A fellow neurologist saw it and commented, ""Great book, but you can't read it."" Though there is a good deal of clinically relevant material here, the book is basically written from a cognitive neuroscience perspective and so some background in that discipline is necessary to comprehend the material. The book is a yeasty mix of theoretical and experimental work in these 34 chapters, often with overlapping but different, and sometimes conflicting, perspectives on the same phenomena, on what was once the terra incognita of the human brain. There is still a great deal of mystery and controversy over how the frontal lobes work, but we have come a long way since the story of Phineas Gage, and the contributors to this book have been amongst the pioneers. Definitely the premiere currently available book on the frontal lobes."
3,A fair mix of kinetics and reactor design. Dense.,"This book does a thorough job of spanning topics from theoretical issues to more practical reactor design, but does neither one very well. In general, it is hard to read. Fogler does a better job with reactor design."
3,good book in need of a good revision,"A good book, with excellent didactic approach; but getting dated.The book needs a good revision ""asap"". The kinetics revision (chap. 1 a 4) is somewhat poor.The reactive chemical systems (chap. 5, 6) are well approached; the liquid phase reaction (chap. 7) is a little too long.The chapters about reactor are very good (chap. 8 to 11).Hill's treatment of heterogeneous reator (chapter 12) is superb. Best among all reactor analysis books that I know.However, chapter 13 and the appendices are useless.The book requires new examples and better figures and tables, as well as, much better list of exercises. In general, new computational calculations (example, data sheets) must be included in the book."
2,Def Not a Beginner Book,"I am a grad student and am retaking kinetics to review for qualifiers. The class I'm currently in uses the Hill book (this book). I have to admit I find it very lackluster. The writing style is more suited to an academic paper than an introductory text and the examples are often woefully incomplete.I used Fogler for my undergrad course and find it a MUCH better book for introductory courses. The only place that Hill surpases Fogler is in that Hill spends more time on Kinetics by themselves while Fogler wraps Kinetics into reactor design. Still, the nature of the writing and poorly worked examples more or less negate whatever benefit this would entail."
2,"Listed as hardcover, but delivered as paperback","I had the same problem as A. Wariso: The textbook above is listed as hardcover, but the book that was delivered to me was a paperback. Look elsewhere if you want a hardcover copy of this text."
2,Hardcover does not mean paperback,"I paid $130 for this book that was described as a HARDCOVER, even in the title. However, when I received the book it the mail, it was in fact a paperback book. I was not pleased with this, but I had no other option but to keep it because I needed the book at the time. I attempted to review the book upon receipt, but I didn't have the option to on the website at that time."
2,Disappointed - False Advertizing,you advertised a hard cover book and thats what I thought I paid for but then they sent me a soft cover book. where is the honesty. I will think twice before making a purchase next time.
2,Not Good!,"I bought this DVD becuase I really wanted to learn the dance moves in ""You Got Served"" and was extremely disappointed. The only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those, I don't know. The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video."
3,Groovaloos Serve it Up Better,"I am so in love with The Groovaloos, I just had to come here and tell ya all. If you want a really awesome instrucitonal DVD, they have 2!!!! I foung out about them because so many of their dancers are in You Got Served and have even danced with Janet Jackson! OMG! I bought both 'Groovin With The Groovaloos' DVDS and they are so cool and so great to learn to do REAL dance moves and 'grooves'. I totally feel like a Janet dancer now... or like someone in You Got Served. The Groovaloos are my new idols. I totally want to move to L.A. and become a Groovaloo. Not to diss the You Got Served instruction, but The Groovaloos they are so hot and talented. OH, you can totally check them out at www.groovaloos.com. They even have a big show happening soon and I am totally going to fly or drive to L.A. to see this. I'M GONNA KEEP GROOVIN WITH THE GROOVALOOS!!!"
2,"See, this is the problem...","You Got Served sucked really really bad. I condemn the film. When a DVD that spins off of You Got Served is released that's even more entertaining than the thing it spun off of, that's really bad.You Got Served = 1 StarThis junk = 2 Stars"
3,Not Bad,Dave Scott is good-no doubt. But would make learning easier if the footage is inverted meaning the viewers will learn from mirror image instead i have to constantly remind myself to move the opposite limp that he is moving tho Dave does perform the choreo once (yes only once) back facing the camera so you can follow him.Besides this point.. everything is cool. Definatley not for beginners.
3,Pretty Good,The video covers a lot of from the film. i would recommend to anyone who is barely getting started in dancing.
5,totally worth ur $$,This.video.is.awesome!! It breaks down step by step ..totally worth it ... And it really helps u learn how to.dance like a pro!
