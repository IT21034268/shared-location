4,An interesting and very diverse book on synaesthesia,"Just like most books of collected readings, Classic and Contemp. Readings presents many conflicting view points that can either confuse the reader or stimulate the reader (hopefully both). Some of the readings are relatively old so the language and ideas are a little archaic. All in all however the diverse readings represent a good majority of the ideas behind synaesthesia. This book is for serious exploration into synaesthesia."
1,System Commander 9 hangs on Windows Vista 32 bit system,"This sounds like a great product, so I brought it through Amazon. It is easy to install. When rebooting for the first time, it scans the disk drives and then hangs. I let it run scanning the disk drives for two hours before rebooting out of it. I unstall System Commander 9 and put it away. I am looking for a boot manager that would work on Windows Vista 32 bit operating system without hanging. I can not recommend this product for Windows Vista 32 bit system. Others may have better mileage with this product."
3,Odd illustrations,"I LOVE the song and really wanted to love this book but the illustrations really don't work for me. When I think Thanksgiving I don't think of sledding, ice fishing, and ice yachting all of which are depicted here."
3,Disturbed my son...,"My 3 year-old son pointed out that the kids are not wearing seatbelts. Catrow draws the seatbelts, he just doesn't put them on the children. The baby is buckled in the carseat, but on the very next page is somehow climbing out the window. That upset my son, because he knows the importance of always staying buckled in. This may be nitpicking to some people, but it really concerned us. Other than that, the story is cute and well illustrated."
1,Slik 6122e Replacement Quick Shoe for Tripods,I can't review this product because I haven't received the product!!! It would be nice to receive my product BEFORE being asked to review it. Please let me know what has happened to my order.
5,Hollywood Beauty Secrets,I love the book. It has a lot of good tips on everything pertaining to beauty. I have purchased facial and body cream and seen the difference. I highly recommend this book.
1,Poor Light,"I got this as a present for my father. I recieved it in a timely matter, but was completely dissatisfied by the product. The light now bright at all...it offers no assistance to a mechanic. The battery cover kept falling off and the batteries won't stay in. I have bought many gloves in the past and I think my normal leather gloves would do more good than these. I wouldn't buy another pair."
5,IRON MAN,"This is a must for all Howard fans,especially the newer ones who may have only read his sword & sorcery stories.Iron Man is about boxing pure and simple;the men who took untold punishment in the ring before usually winning their bouts by knocking out their fatigued opponents.Howard wrote this using some of his personal experiences following the fight game in Texas and has based some of his later and well known characters like Conan and Kull on the fighters in this book.They all share the same characteristics of toughness,incredible vitality and endurance.Iron Man is a good guide to how Howard thought and how he shaped his future characters"
5,Great tips and easy to read!,This book gives the reader great insight into how to manage stress and what are some common stressors. A great deal for anyone interested in re-evaluating their lives!
2,Not his best publishing,"The book basically tells you to eat balanced meals take sone supplements, with the advice of your health care professional of course, exercise from a biblical point of view."
5,Great book at a good value,I bought this for my mom and don't know what she thinks of it yet but I liked what I had read before I gave it to her as a gift.
1,Dr. Colbert is OK with abortifacients,"I won't be reading anything more from Dr. Colbert after I read this book. Unfortunately, he is not pro-life. That's not cool."
3,Love the explanation of metabolic syndrome; dislike biblical references,"I really liked reading parts of this book that were the medical/psychological connection between health and wellness. Syndrome X (metabolic syndrome) explained very well and the ""why we get fat"" thing was interesting and understandable and how stress plays a part.I really disliked all the biblical references. Was he ""preaching."" or writing a self-help book, or a medical-based theory or a psychology book on stress. Can't quite tell what his real purpose was in writing this book. His bias towards religion turned me off!"
3,OK! but flawed,"If you don't have soft soil, it well spin inside the drill. This causes you to constantly stop and tighten the chuck. I don't have that soft soil like you see on TV. Good luck!"
3,somewhat limited,I think that this is probably a very useful tool under the right conditions. However it is virtually useless in hard and rocky soil. The dirt needs to be loose and root free. Also the end of the shaft that sticks into the drill should be ground with several flat edges rather than perfectly round so that the drill can get a better grip on it.
5,Flower Power,This works great for planting flower bulbs. I driled holes for two days planting about a thousand bulbs and this auger did the job.
3,Needs a squared end for fitting into bit,"Works fine. Used for drilling holes for auger / stakes to put in ground to hold up my trees from this crazy winter in the eastern USA.Would be perfect if it had a better end to keep from slipping in a drill bit, but not that big a deal.I ground the end down, flatter, on a grinding wheel so it wouldn't slip - now perfect."
4,Perfect Stake Digger,Exactly what was needed to pre-drill holes for 2X2 stakes when installing 1X4 wooden border around house. Now crushed stones can be installed within the border and they will stay put. Pounding stakes in the ground is really stupid!
5,Surprised,"I used this to dig chain link fence post holes and was surprised how well it works. It won't go through rock of any sort but it worked great on some very hard packed ground. I don't think it was designed for such heavy duty use but I've used it to drill more than 20 holes with a 1/2"" electric drill and it's still working."
2,Do yourself a favor and rent a proper tool,"The idea of this tool is a good one. However, the quality of the steel used in this tool and its design are poor. Demand better from manufacturers. This is a 'china tool' which has soft pot metal for its structure and little thought to its design. Save your money. It will work in sift soils and where no roots exist. But, Demand better tools from Amazon. It is 2008 not 1954."
5,Planter augur,"I used this to dig the holes for the big plant food sticks, using my rechargable drill. Did a fantastic job, though did quick work on the charged battery (digging in Florida's floratam grass). Nice to not have to bend over and dig the holes by hand. Packaging could have been better, as the shaft went through the box, and got a little bent, which makes it really wobbly. Still a great drill for my purposes."
2,weed drill,This item has limited use - could be better with a tapered drill down to the tip (in my opinion).It doesn't have enough value to return.
4,"Good, solid product","I needed to dig a few post holes for 1-5/8 diameter posts in clay. I took the one reviewer's advice and had a machinist cut a hex on the shank before hand. It should be noted that the night before I used the Roto Digger, it rained for over an hour.I didn't give a fifth star because of a combination of the shank really needs a hex shape and I am skeptical about recommending a cordless drill being able handle varying types of soil, depths and quantity of holes.Otherwise, I am very pleased with the Roto Digger and the previous reviews helped me make a good purchase."
4,Not bad for the price.,"Bought this to drill holes for 30"" ground spikes that will support a 4x4 and a temporary fence. Made pounding the spikes into the ground so much easier. I would recommend using a hammer drill if you have to dig farther than 6"". My 19.2 V cordless drill works okay for turning soil and planting bulbs. If you have to dig deep it helps if you wet the area and pour more water into the hole about halfway through digging. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had a hex head. You sometimes have to stop and tighten the chuck. If it breaks I'd buy it again."
4,"Not Perfectly Designed Or Constructed, But Makes Short Work Of Planting Bulbs","I bought this to save time and my back while planting 200 bulbs this fall. I really did not experience any issues with the auger loosening up from the drill head, but a less rounded shaft would have been a better idea. I went through two full charges on the drill's batteries, but I could not believe how quickly or easily it was to plant bulbs this year. It got hung up on a few stones and roots, but that was no big deal for me -- I just moved over a few inches. The drill may twist in your hand if the auger gets stuck, so be careful if you are weak wristed. I found that putting the drill in reverse helps to get the auger unstuck."
4,Happy With It!,"So i bought this for planting bulbs. Hooked it up to my cordless drill and planted 200-250 bulbs in about 30 minutes with my 5 yr old daughter. The Auger is really great! The stem on it is solid.-Only warning or concern, is I do not know how long it will hold out. Our soil is pretty rocky and the blades tend to bind on then large cobbles. The auger blades are welded in 3 points, so if you abuse it, the welds will break.BUT-I was not babying it and it held great. And again, saved me about 2 hours of time so far. And for teh money, worth every penny..."
2,roto drill,"the product would possibly work better if I had a more powerful drill. The one thing lacking in the product is the drill end, it is smooth and round and really slips alot. It is very hard to keep drilling as it slips. A better drill may not work any better due to the round end. The product appears to be fairly strong metal. The actual drilling is slow and your soil or dirt has to be fairly soft and loose. I tried to drill into my tree so I couldget water to the roots or at least closer. No success so trying to drill and water, drill and water...that may work.[[ASIN:B000P71GLU Yard Butler RD-2 30-Inch Roto Digger]"
2,Needed longer auger to use from wheelchair.,"I just want to say that this product is not finished when it is sold.No one related to the production of this product has thought about grinding thetop of the drill/auger; this small process not being done may save you money but it makes the drill useless to us who expect it to turn when being used, and not spinning in the drill chuck."
2,low quality digger,"I just received it. I haven't used it yet. But I can tell the thin metal thread won't go trough the clay terrain here in Houston, it may the first couple of holes. It looks was designed to dig soft soils. I am not sure if ship it back now, or give a chance and use it."
2,Don't Read This Unless You Truly Must!,"I love to hate this book. Every page was painful and frustrating. I use examples from his commentary on Biblical texts every so often. I reference his book as a ""what not to do/read"" when teaching frequently. The author dedicates his book to Survivors of the Holocaust and Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse. Survivors Should Never Read This. I don't believe God executes Justice on Earth. If your friend was married to the Abusing God described by this author, you would tell her to run and never look back. How can anyone responsibly teach this theology?! How can anyone encourage people to ""stay with"" an Abusing God?! If you have to read it, please borrow it from the library. Don't buy it."
4,Right,"My last 5 cars had leather seats. My new Town and Country has fabric seats. My wife insisted I get leather. The Wagen Tech IN-2248 Looks Right, Fits right, feels right. I liked it so well I bought another for my side of the T&C; THE right product at the right peiceJerell Sorensen !"
4,"looks nice, good price","just wish I would have bought one of them a little longer because I misjudged the distance I really needed. They are heavy in weight, very attractive and as far as I can tell they work good. I recommend them for the money I payed and I hope to buy more in the near future."
4,Nice but a bit pricey,I bought this because my 3rd brake light on my Ford Ranger began leaking every time it rained. The factory replacement is cheaper but this is nicer and brighter with LED's. It does NOT mention on here that this is NOT street legal. It says it on the box but since I bought it I thought it would look good anyway so I replaced my original with this one. I don't think the cops will care one way or the other if this thing is street legal or not. I recommend this for your Ranger but you are paying $75 dollars for 50 cents worth of plastic.
4,A very good introductory book,"This was the first book i read as an introduction to general relativity.The physical insights are truly great and the mathematics are presented in an easy to follow way needing only very few requirements.Im writing this rewiew nevertheless to explain why i rate it with 4 stars rather than five.The preblem i believe this book has is with the philosophy that tensor calculus is analyzed.The author begins with proving tensor calculus equation in a way that is valid ONLY for special relativity,then proceeds with the analysis of tensor calculus for the 2-d eucledian space,and again the equations are valid ONLY for the given space.In the end the author generalises the tensor equations for any spacetime using the Equivalence Principle,and not a solid mathematical proof,whitch Ifound confusing.As a result i give the book 4 stars because of the lack of a truly solid mathematical analysis of the manifold thery.Nevertheless its a great book for a beginner."
3,Not for Self Study! Otherwise OK!,I purchased this book for self study as was recommended by some of the fellow readers but was disappointed to find following issues.1. Many concepts are not explained fully in the chapters but are rather built into the exercises. As solutions to exercises are not provided in the book it becomes very difficult for understanding the concepts on your own. There is an online file containing solution on Cambridge Universtity press but access to that file is provided only if you are a teacher. This makes the book practically useless for self study.2. Many equations are given in the book without providing the proper derivation or proof of the equations.Apart from these drawbacks the book is good and can be useful for students with someone available to explain the concepts. Definitely not for self study.
3,"Good Intro, but Leaves A LOT out","As background, I am a senior undergrad doing a thesis on black hole perturbations (following Chandrasekhar). This was the first book I got on GR, a little over a year ago, and I fell in love with it. It does a great job of quickly, though not completely painlessly, introducing you to GR. HOWEVER, as I now continue my ventures further, I find a lot of fundamental concepts lacking in my education. I went from this book onto parts of Wald: not a good idea IMO. I am currently paging through Lovelock and Rund and wishing the mathematical aspect had been introduced in Schutz as well as here. In the end, very nice, well explained intro to the concepts, but you NEED to either supplement with better mathematical explanation, or move quickly to higher book."
5,"Bernard Schultz, A first Course in General Relativity","This is the best introduction to the General Relativity for undergrads and grads. Rigorous, profound, and stimulating. A proof of the Special Relativity's fundamental theorem (the interval invariance) is presented with utmost clarity. Delight to read."
1,Shoalin and Wu Tang,"I had great expectation when I purchased this video. My expectation was not close to the rality. This movie has one of the lousiest plot that I have seen. I like the training part of the movie but that is all that is good about this movie. I thought that there would be a great martial arts fight on the end but I was wrong. The movie end up like it got started, a secondary demonstration of martial arts. Gordon Liu and Adam Cheng was never able to demonstrate their martial arts skill because in order for them to demonstrate their art they have to create another plot than what they have created. I would not recomend this movie, it is a total lost of money. Gordon Liu should stay away from directing and just stick on acting."
3,"good times, inspired wu-tang..","Checking out the movies that Wu-Tang Clan, etc., took samples from, I started with the 1st one from their 1st album. Seems like my/this? version may have been recorded from a video to dvd..Not that I care, just a fun time seeing this kung fu stuff. with chinese subtitles that don't go away, which i like.."
2,Great Movie Horrible Quality,"This movie is indeed awesome. It seems that the company that made it recorded it from tv or something and then packaged it as a dvd. there are no credits at the end and the movie literally ends and there is a bunch of static (like you would get at the end of a VHS). The movie was supposed to be widescreen and it was fullscreen and becausae of this, you cant read any of the subtitles (not that i need them) and you cant take them away. This company sucks and no one should buy this dvd from the company, look elsewhere to find a better quality video if you care about that sort of thing. Gordon Liu is a sav and this movie is awesome."
1,This is DOOgitally remastered! DON'T BUY ... BEWARE!,"I just tried to watch this movie.The sound constantly hisses like a poor tape recording, whether in stereo or surround sound.This really killed the movie. I could deal with the poor visual ( e.g. illegible dubs & grainy movie ), but this was the straw that broke the camel's back.Save your $ for a better quality Asian movie > Butterfly & Sword, 7 Swords, Shinobi - Heart Under Blade"
4,the brothers,"This is a gresat movie and i would recommend that everyone see it. It has everything that a good movie of it's callobar should have comedy, sex, betrayal and a lot more."
1,This movie was bad,"I was very disappointed at this movie. The typical male bull story about men who cannot (or find reasons not to) commit, the desparate woman (Jenifer Lewis) who sits back and waits for a man who she used to be married to until he's all played out. I wished I had not ordered this movie from PPV. Next time I'll ask someone."
3,So..So..Movie,"This movie is not NEARLY as good as The Best Man. Shamar Moore should stay with the Soaps. Morris Chestnut, and D.L. Hugley made the movie. Everybody else was just plain boring!If you are looking for a good movie to rent...this would be one, but not to make a part of your collection."
2,"Look, don't listen","The brothers are gorgeous, but the acting is awful. I guess the writing could have been better. There are some funny scenes, but other than that, just look!!"
4,"Great DVD, okay movie.","Likeable film about 4 men who go through the trials and tribulations of relationships. Call it ""Waiting to Exhale"" with testosterone. Morris Chestnut and DL Hughley give performances good enough to redeem the film of its predictable script. So why the 4 stars? Because the DVD is packed with a decent bunch of extras! We get a nice running commentary by the director, deleted scenes, a featurette, a music video, and, of course, the trailer for this film and other Sony releases. The best of these features is the ""Conversation with Director Gary Hardwick."" He gives a very informative look at the movie; this guy is so laid back and down-to-earth, he looks like he could be your next-door-neighbor. So if you've already seen the film and liked it, you should definitely pick this one up; the wealth of features make it more than a worthy purchase."
3,Mmm mmm mmm,2 words... SHEMAR MOORE! Mmm mm mmm. lol. That is the only reason i bought this movie. It was surprisingly good. I love Morris Chestnut (acting wise) in it as well. He can do no wrong! ;)
4,The Brothers,It's a great movie as 4 close friends discover a lot about each other and themselves and the women who are in their lives.
1,Re-Tread Plot,"There's really not much to say about this film. There were a few funny moments that had me laughing out loud, but overall the storyline itself is just awful. 2002's version of blackploitation. Lots of talented actors who should be working with material more worthy of their skills."
1,Falls short way short,"This movie is in the category of ""Falls Short of Expectation"" I saw this film the first day of its release and I was highly disappointed. I was looking forward to another African American film about young and talented successful men ie., ""Love Jones"" ""Best Man"" what I was left with is tired unbelievable dialouge a very predictable plot and just plain bad acting. I get the impression that Shemar Moore is only an effective actor if his shirt is off. This movie should have been wonderful but it isn't."
1,Please Do Not Waste your Money,"Poor Acting and shallow characterers followed by a missing plot combine for a poor movie. D.L. Hugley's character is mildly entertaining, but Shemah Moore's fixation with his fiance is perplexing. I should have expected less than an intelligent, introspective, comedy about black male relationships that I was expecting."
1,Booooo,"I gotta tell you, this had to be my least favorite movie so far. I ran to see it as soon as it came out, only to find that it was the same ole ""friends"" movie with shallow actors. Don't get me wrong, The men were attractive but, will Shalmar ever be in anything WITHOUT taking off his shirt??"
3,Mildly entertaining and has a nice flow,"It's about four good looking and professional Black men. ""The Brothers"" is what they call themselves collectively. Each has a story around them. One falls in love for a woman who dated his dad. She's reluctant to tell him this even as their relationship deepens. Another is angry at Black woman and bad-mouthes them. It's because he's hurt about how his mother treats him. The third is a guy who plays the field and been with so many women that when he announces he's is going to marry the one he's with now, ""the brothers"" are shocked. One thing he doesn't like about her is her gun. The last is married and has a little girl. He wants his wife to try something different in bed, she doesn't want to calling it ""nasty"". They both get stubborn over this issue and causes a lot of tension between them."
2,A Good Idea Gone Wrong...,"Alright, this could have been a terrific film, considering that African-Americans have been getting a treasure-trove of great films in recent years (Soul Food, The Best Man, Love & Basketball, Hav Plenty).I looked forward to seeing this DVD, but got disappointed when I saw it. Too many scenes consisted of seeing the men (or women) sit around talking about their problems. Too much talking, and not enough action. Who cares if a character walked out on his woman! If I didn't see the action, I feel like I got cheated. So, needless to say, the script left something to be desired.Also, some of the problems seemed contrived. D.L. Hughley's character willing to separate from his wife because just wouldn't get kinky with him was unbelievable.If you just want something to watch, then rent this, but don't buy it. If you want to buy a good Black ensemble movie, I recommend The Best Man, Hav Plenty, or even She's Gotta Have It."
2,ITS ALREADY BEEN DONE!,"I thought that this movie was so-so.I would have though It was great In the days of the stereotypical images of african american's In movies.It seems as If I have already seen this movie(The best man,which I liked,and the wood).Its seems as though we are In danger of repeating the mistake of the 70's blackploxtation era (same rehased storylines) except it's now the ghetto or the buppie friends finding themselves.It's time to get away from this formula and try something new."
4,Excellent Instrumentals!,"Great music for driving, cleaning, and absolutely perfect music to dine by. I bought this CD for myself and have purchased several more to give as gifts. My sister told me she loves to listen to her copy of ""Living by the Lake"" when she's ironing. Anyone who has ever ironed can appreciate that anything which helps that chore go by easier is worth its weight in gold ... and then some!!"
2,Scary Toy,"My son isn't scared of the vacuum cleaner, but he hates this toy. It scares him and we had to get rid of it so he wouldn't freak out. The button (on the nose of the toy) is hard to push for infants and he could never push it himself."
1,neat but dangerous,"I would not suggest this toy for children under at least one year of age. While they are attracted to the vibrations it is made from very hard plastic and things such as the ears and nose sticking out can cause bumps, bruises and other tears. Also, after dropping it once on our kitchen floor it stopped working. It is cute but just be careful with this one."
5,Our daughter LOVES this toy!,"Our daughter loves this cute pig, it is inexpensive and durable. She has dropped it several times from her high chair, and it still works. She likes the vibration and uses her mouth to make it work. Simple toy that keeps her entertained for a few minutes. She also has and loves the cow, but seems to pick the pig more often."
1,oh I hate this toy,"Grandma got this as a holiday gift for my daughter. Grandma is very generous and we love her bunches, but I wish she had saved her money.Please don't buy it. It's awful. You hit the nose and it shakes for 5 seconds. That's it. It's a big, bulky, obnoxious toy. I have no idea how this got through product design.I hate getting gifts that you have to throw away. This isn't even donatable. I couldn't pawn this off on any of my friends. It's that bad. No one would take this for free. I don't know how this is on the market. It's ugly, doesn't do anything, is too big .... I suppose if you have a basement full of toys you can toss this into the pile of stuff the kid will never play with, but if you are space constrained, you just can't have something like this."
1,Lame,"Barely shakes at all. And you have to constantly keep pushing the button. It needs an ""on"" and ""off"" switch. It's in the trash after 2 days."
1,2nd rate not karaoke cd,these are sold as karaoke in fact it is a 2nd rate music cd by a cover band not even the original artists.
5,Layouts,"If you want to build a 50's display layout, this is the book for you. It will show you how to wire the layout what piece you need for the projects."
3,Am I a contrarian?,"Am I a contrarian?Logan's previous books have shown a steady climb in character complexity, literary skills and plot construction. His eye for the relevant image, ear for language and insight to behavior were becoming increasingly integrated into the structure of his tales. While still primarily airplane books, one was becoming more and more hesitant to leave them on the plane.But this latest, while economically understandable (and who among us has not taken a client, a task, a deal for a quick profit but in the hopes of little publicity), smacks of a paste job turned out fast, fast, fast to take advantage of the newly popular terrorist market. Particularly disappointing was the lack of development of the intriguing character, Tim Downs. A favorite with Logan's long standing fan base, Downs was underused this time around.But don't count Logan out: the next book should return to the righteous flight path Logan has set for himself."
1,audio cd book,"disc 2 of the item purchased was cracked and inoperative. The label part of the cd looked fine, but turned over was crack ran all the way through it."
1,"Good Packaging, Poor Product","The hype on the outside of the box is exactly that - HYPE. The product crashed my G4, on both Mac OS 9.04 and 9.1, and was unstable. Talk about Beta - this product has it in spades!"
5,A PHENOMENAL GUIDE TO EUROPEAN SOCCER CLUBS,"I purchased this book with the hopes of reading something different than the normal coaching manuals that seem to take up so much space. Boy was I thrilled to see an actual book that tells you EVERYTHING you want/need to know about the top clubs from virtually every nation in Europe. From where to buy tickets to how to get to the stadium, this book is worth every penny."
4,"like soccer, good but not great",As a primer to travel to various soccer grounds and cities in Europe this is a great book. Some of the choices though are odd and I found from experience some very out of date. Maybe all this book needs is a good factchecker.
5,fabulous!,"this is a WONDERFUL book. an easy-to-read informative little package crammed with pertinent information on major european football locales, as well as gems on lesser known clubs...all written with a dry, at times hilarious narrative tone."
1,Almost every page missing information,The book talks about the fact that some pages might be cut short. If they had manufactured the book and put the information sideways on the pages less information would be cut off. Almost every single page was missing pictures or information. Poor printing.
5,Living Love Is Practical Christianity,"Living Love is all about what we do as people when the rubber meets the road in our relationships. It is about loving when it is impossible and trusting God with the outcome. I found this work motivating and challenging. I find it easy to offer kindness to those deemed deserving, while having trouble pushing past my self with those who seeminly don't deserve my time. In this book my mind was riveted with the idea of being God's empty vessel, used to pour out to others. I think Living Love is medicine for the soul, good for every Christian to ponder and meditate. Thank You Debbie Alsdorf for transparancy and honesty, and helping realize once again that with God all things are possible."
4,Living Love,It is a great bible study with a group of women. It deals with the relationship we should have with God and each other. It refers to our daily walk with Christ and love. I recommend the study for a small womens group.
3,Esswntial Chuang Tzue,"This has some great writings from Chuang Tzu, although it can be a bit tough to read, as it dry in spots. Has a lot ancient rhetoric from the times of Chuang Tzu, so an interest in this area would help in keeping the readers attention."
4,"Sturdy, although the paint came off too easily.","Very sturdy construction.The pan/tilt head takes sometime to get used to. Still it is slower to use comparing to the snap-lock type. The Advantage is that the temperature does not affect how tight you can lock, comparing to the snap-lock type."
5,Great Sports!,"I don't usually write reviews but I wanted to with this sports bra. I go by reviews so wanted to return the favor. This is a very comfortable cotton type sports bra. If your large busted and want something that supports running, biking or any high impact sports, this one's for you. I'm very picky and will get another one of these."
3,Small Cups,"I should have taken the advice from previous reviewers. The cups on this bra run small. Yes, I'm inbetween a 36 or 38 band, but always take a ""C"" cup. I ordered the 36C and this bra smashes my girls together for a uni-bra look and very little coverage. I will be returning it."
4,great sports bra,"I really like the bra. For me personally, I would have liked the shoulder straps to be adjustable. Otherwise, it is a super sports bra"
5,Lily of France sports bra,This is a great sports bra for the price. The underwire is a must and the wide straps make it very comfy.
3,Sized improperly.,"This bra seems to run small. I ordered this in the size that all my bras are in and this sports bra seemed slightly small. I like the fact that it has the cups because it keeps everything held down firm! Other plain sports bras without the cups just squeeze me to death and aren't comfortable. I think you might want to order up in the band size. I ordered the 36 D, and I think a 38 D would have been better."
3,It's small,"It's good quality and excellent material, but not according to standard American sizes, too small for me.Therefore, the cup should consider when buying this product, choose a cup preferably more than one size that you usually wear."
3,Comfortable,"This bra is very comfortable, but not as supportive as racerback, non-stretch sport bras. Also, there's no way to adjustment the length of the straps."
3,promptly received-promptly returned!,"The item was received promptly enough, but due to it being mislabelled, was not the size I ordered, thus I returned it promptly. The company was very good about refunding me the price of item and shipping, but I had to call about it before it was credited to me (the shipping)."
1,"Bra is great, seller was slow","I love this bra, but I had to cancel my order after waiting a month and a half for my items. They sent one note about it being on backorder after 3 weeks, but there was no more communication after that.Not cool."
2,Truely the worst ever,"First when I got it (really quickly by the way) I couldn't figure out how to wear it...the wires for the underwire were on the outside of the bra? Huh? Yeah, super weird...plus the sizing was totally wrong. I had to go to a store and buy one, this just didn't do it at all. Gave it to a friend, maybe they can use it!"
3,Does not fit for FULL FIGURE,"If you want your bra to fit like two cones sitting on your chest, then go for it. I'm returning mine, I can take someone's eye out with this bra. I wear a size 34D."
2,"What happened?? it changed Comfortable, but","they made this bra smaller and the cups smaller and the cups also make my boobs look pointy, what happened and why have they changed? and mine is not 95% cotton either so the material has changed too!!! Don't buy these, I think I am returning them for false claims, the cotton content is not the same and the bra is not as comfortable!!It gives that uni-boob look, it is very comfortable and holds the girls in place so they are not bouncing along but I sure wish it was made so it would separate instead of forcing them together."
5,"It is great in every way. Fits well, and washes like a dream.",I ordered this without knowing how it would fit or what it looked like. I live in Buenos Aires and I had someone bring it to me. It fits great - true to size. I wash it in the washer and hang it to dry. It is perfect. As a sport bra you could not ask for anything better.
2,I Returned It,This bra did not fit well at all. It's been a while now since I purchased and I cannot recall the exact details. You should only buy a bra online if it's a model you already own and know it fits.
3,Good if you don't need to adjust the straps,"So, I like how the underwire and stuff is on the outside of this bra. It makes it very smooth up against your skin. Also it seems like it would be pretty supportive, even for larger sizes (I'm a 34D) unless you have a short torso like me. This bra has absolutely no way to adjust the straps so if you have a long or short torso this bra is probably not the best for you."
3,Underwire bra,The material on this bra is nice as is the price. But where it cuts under the armpit creates chafing and when I move my arms I am bothered by it. I think this is a design issue and not a size issue.
3,Protects well but Quality was bad,"mainely I brought it to protect my phone, as it fell multiple times from me, and the end result was a damaged battery. I have to say it is doing the Job very well specially the back side piece protects the battery door very well. but when I first received the items, it was full of scartches and smudges. so I think that the quality of this product could have been made much better than this."
2,cool looking figure but its durablity is horriable,"I collect alot of Mcfarlane figure's and I have no complaints except for this particualar figure, I remember getting this when I was 12 and it was christmas that time til when I turned just about 15 this sucker just broke down by pieces I was really mad when that happen cause how BA this figure looks as many as you know this figure is base on Terminator 2 when that famous scene when the terminator placed his foot on a skull and crushed it so now I'm using this terminator has a battle scene with my T-X Endoskeleton standing over itl looking badass any way great detail but this figure will probably wont last that long if being played with I would recommend you keep it in the package for sure.Articulation: head turns 180, arms moves a whole 360 degrees, knees go in and out, spine moves 180.Paint: 10 out of 10stands: 6inchoverall score: 2 out of 10"
5,Great tool to add to your trading...,"The often overlooked Andrews Fork, is a powerful trading tool to add to your trader toolbox arsenal.It's no wonder Dr. Alan Andrews made millions using Pitchforks to gauge stocks (or any market for that matter) providing warning lines and trading ranges of markets.Follow the rules for proper alignment of the Pitchfork(s), by aligning High/Low/High or Low/High/Low Pivot Points, then plot outer secondary warning upper/lower levels; the Andrews Pitchfork provides the trader with a price channel for trends and trading ranges.Follow the rules and you should definitely improve your trading. When the market rises or falls outside the Pitchfork(s), or does not reach the fork channel, it gives the trader foresight to where the market should be headed.Good read, good luck."
4,Are you serious about trading?,"if the answer is yes,then I recommend this book for you. its very well written and its the complete pitchfork guide as far as I know. technical analysis trader, at one time or another, relies one trendlines to make his/her forecasts. the book gives you some methods, but you should add what works in your own trading system/style. I suggest to combine trendlines with osillators(I prefer slow stochastic), moving average (macd is the greatest)and chart patterns (double tops/bottoms,head and shoulders ..etc)to avoid bad entries. I don't recommend that you ignore normal support/resistance trendlines. they do work if you know how to apply them ,trader needs time and patient to master trendlines.good trader keeps learning. good luck"
4,Great Information but...,"I received New Millenium Encylopedia October 16. The program itself is wonderful, however, after repeated tries I still have not been able to register the program and the Info Center link in the program hasn't worked. Other than those problems and that the Versabook features (the ability to get more books for the reference program) is only available with registration, the books and information are well worth the money."
5,"The SBL Handbook of Style: For Ancient Near Eastern, Biblical, and Early Christian Studies",If you are studying Hebrew or Ancient Semitic languages you need this book for documentation and for dissertations. Excellent and a requirement for the Socity of Biblical Languages.
3,not like the picture-- featherless!,"I had tried this same costume on at a costume party store-- it had the feathers (not nearly as much as the picture, and many kept falling off). It was also a snug fit, as I am a size 12 and the info said it would fit up to a size 12. The costume that I ordered has no feathers on top, just some black fringe. I was also noticing how loose the dress was, and then I looked at the tag, it says plus size on it! The package says standard size. The wrong size must have been put in the bag, and maybe now they are not using the feathers. It fits me very comfortably so I am keeping and using for a couples costume party this weekend. But per the picture online, it is some false advertising."
2,Adult miss kitty costume,"I didn't have high expectations for the price but I think it was false advertising. The picture shows something that was not true. It showed feathers. They don't exists. The head dress was much nicer in the photo than in fact. Please be honest in what you are selling. Show the true product and let us decide if we want to spend the money for it. I will think twice before I order on line again, for fear all products are not as shown. Sham on you."
4,Superb film!!,"This is one of the best martial arts film in my all time list. Although you see the same story in most martial arts movies(pupil's family gets killed by the ching, pupil goes to Shaolin and learn some deadly techniques to avenge the death of his family). Chen Kwan Tai was superb, as the ferocious shaolin student who learned the deathly monkey techniques to seek revenge. Great costumes and fight scenes."
2,disapponting,"I was looking forward to Chen Kuan Tai's ""Iron Monkey"". This excitement was doused by the poor quality video and equally poor audio."
3,Pretty good period flick!.,"The story line is okay, may have been better if the dubbing weren't so bad. Action doesn't ready come until the end, but when it does, it's good. I think one of the venoms is in this, but his part is limited. I hear the 1993 remake is the boom!"
2,Buy the real Iron monkey,"The plot was a bit old. Parents die, child left alone, child learns kungfu, child avenges death, not a lot of action scenes, should move more fluid like during the actions scenes, the fights looked so predictable.I dont recommend this movie to anyone, save your money/"
3,you get what you pay for...,"I was looking for a cheap alternative to overpriced, name-brand military-style watches. I thought this Rothco might fit the bill but unfortunately I got what I paid for: a watch worth $19, and not a penny more.The case is base metal, not stainless steel, the caseback is snap-on. The strap is so-so in quality. The hands are highly polished and don't match well with the bead-blasted case. Lume is virtually nonexistent. To me, though, the biggest let-down is the sloppiness of the movement. The minute hand will wiggle back and forth over the span of a full minute, even more when the crown is pulled out. That level of sloppiness is a dealbreaker for me, and for anyone interested in using their watch to tell accurate time.I'm returning this watch and planning on spending a little more money to get a much nicer watch."
4,As good as my Panasonic,"I've used the Panasonic rotary clipper for many years until I dropped it and it died. I thought I'd try the Wahl because is has the dual head. The rotary head works very well but I am not sure of the value of the second head. Either way it is a great clipper. One of the frustrating issues is snapping the plastic cover back on, it has to be in just the right position."
1,Doesn't do the job,"I bought this item after reading so many positive reviews. Well, I can tell you that this trimmer is not something anyone who wants a close trim should buy. The trimmer is quiet and does not snag hairs, but it also barely cuts any hair. You can only use the sides of the trimmer to trim instead of the top on so many other trimmers.I recommend the Hammacher Schlemmer ""best nose hair trimmer."" It only costs a few dollars more than this Wahl and it trims so much better."
2,Pictures can be deceiving,"This product's so-called ""dual heads"" are shown in a scale that is totally misleading. The actual hair and eyebrow trimmers are a joke, both being too flimsy and small to be even marginally effective for anyone larger than a GI Joe doll. The basic unit is an okay nose hair trimmer. Billing the product as anything more than that is bogus."
2,OK trimmer; poor design,"The trimmer part works fine. The problem is the design of the trimmer. The battery compartment is on the handle where your fingers wrap around the trimmer while starting and in use. But when you start the trimmer, it is easy to open the compartment by the light amount of force you exert on the body just to press the operating button to on with your thumb.I guess duct tape would work."
4,Wahl personal trimmer,"Operates on one AA battery, very easy and very effective, a steal at this price. previously used a small scizzors, this is an order of magnitude better."
4,Wahl 5545-506 Dual Head Wet/Dry Personal Trimmer,"nice item for the price, a little noisy. Recommended"
1,worthless,"This is a very low quality trimmer. It's not made in the USA like some other Wahl products. It does a terrible job of trimming. I have another Panasonic trimmer, and while that one has hurt me, it does a much better job trimming. I could spend an hour using this Wahl to trim the hair, or I can spend 5 minutes with the Panasonic being careful."
3,Just Another Nose Hair Ripper,"This thing does it's job. But with the amazing minds out there, why can't someone come up with a better way of trimming or eliminating nose & ear hair without having to stick a razor sharp (most of the time) blade up your nostril that is spinning at mind boggling speeds and hoping and praying that ""this time"" a hair won't get brutally ripped out causing extreme pain? Wahl makes some of the best trimmers out there. Is this one unique or different? No. It's just another ear & nose hair trimmer. It works fine and I would most likely purchase the same brand again."
3,AN ECLETIC GEM,"I'm not gonna tell you how I came across this one, just know that it was worth every penny, all seventeen hundred of them. Snowboy delivers Latin vibes, hip-hop, DJ, and raw grooves on a very tight CD. I was amazed when I first heard it. This kat got talent behind the musical boards. This is the most played CD by me in the last couple of days, but like most of my CDs, it's sure to go in my huge collection of gems that I may not pick up for another month or two because of something else that may have cought my ear. But until then, ""Jazzkuti"", ""The New Avengers"" and ""Lucky Fellow"" has my head knodding at the traffic lights on my way to work.oNe"
3,hits from 5 earlier recordings,"Nice groovy tunes from 1992-98, taken from the following recordings:1. Something's Coming2. M.F.O.S.3. The 3 Faces of Snowboy4. The New Avengers EP5. Lucky Fellow (single)Vocals on 3 tracks. Not necessarily my favorite recording by Snowboy, but it's good for the bargain price (used)."
5,The master guitarist.,"I wasn't too sure what I was getting from the former leader of the Shadows. I needn't have worried. These are selections from a master guitarist. With two cd discs, it gives one plenty of time to listen to instrumental rock and roll with a beat or a mellow sound and mostly the twang of a melifuous sound. With songs one never heard of, one is in for a treat. Then there are the songs we remember from the past from the Shadows affiliation with Cliff Richard; ""Living Doll,"" ""Devil Woman,"" ""Summer Holiday,"" and ""The Young Ones."" If you are like me who spent the 1960's enjoying great guitar music, then pick up a copy of Hank Marvin, you'll never regret it."
2,Horrible,I was really sorry I purchased this....with all the people she did they concentrated on musicians Ive never even heard of. It was slow moving to say the least and very boring. I dont recommend this at all.
2,Pretty good but...,"I liked this DVD but I was not impressed. When you can draw like Miss Caster you should persue some sort of craft. This casting thing is unique and cool but it isn't paying the rent for her. She still gets $100.00 dollars a month from her mother who she calls the warden. Very sad. She is a very likable person in the DVD. Almost sweet. It is really nice when she gets her ""show"" in New York City but the buck stops there. Where is her life going? It got frustrating. Someone with so much talent needs to get some self respect and self worth. I am a huge fan of Miss Pamela Des Barres. Maybe she should help Ms. Caster get her book done. I would buy it and read it. Miss Des Barres is a good writer and Ms. Caster could benefit from a bit of work ethic. Miss Pamela?? She could use your help."
4,A Rock-Solid Documentary That's a Blast,"I saw Cynthia Plaster Caster's ""babies"" on display at Threadwaxing Space in 2000, read about her in a 2001 issue of BB Gun, and was thus very eager to see this. I got my chance at a recent film festival, and thoroughly enjoyed it.This documentary is as unique as its subject, who comes across as quirky, warm and eternally youthful, and whose craft provides us with a bizarre but indispensible bit of rock n roll memorabilia.You'll love ""Plaster Caster"" if you're a fan of: British rock of the 1960s and '70s; the GTO era of LA; the ""indie"" music scene of the 1980s and '90s; dive bars inhabited by shaggy-haired rock n rollers; and the DIY aesthetic.I'm definitely buying this on DVD."
1,This is a good book to waste your time.,"There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work. Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques. If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment. This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.Spend your time elsewhere."
2,Horrible Layout,"The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired. The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents. Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to. The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book. You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused. If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher."
4,I now own three of these,"These are light-weight but durable tripods. I do travel documentaries and these are perfect. They are small and light, so no problem carrying one around attached to a backpack or photo vest. If I drop one and break it, I haven't trashed hundreds of dollars like I would with one of my pro models. They are stable, I even attach motorized pan/tilt heads to them, plus the camera and have had no tilt problems.It isn't a pro model by any means, but it does well and you cannot beat the price."
5,The Spirit of the Hills,"This CD wonderfully captures the spirit of the Dakotas. If you appreciate the beauty of nature, this CD lives up to its promise, and more. As I listen I can imagine myself watching the moon rise over the prairie, feeling the wind playing through crops on a summer afternoon, or standing in awe of a blazing sunset over the hills.If you find yourself in need of a peaceful tribute to nature and nature's God, you will not regret buying this album."
1,A Disappointment,"For $5.95, I don't feel that this was worth it. I actually got more information and inspiration from YouTube. Even though people have been doing this for years, this is an under-covered subject in the states.I would like to see Amazon offer some of the videos and books listed on www.aquaponics.net.au . From what I've seen, Australia is a little farther ahead of America on this trend.Also, if you are a survivalist, this may be a real solution for your food production needs. You can still hunt, but it's hard to beat home-grown fish that also nourish your plants."
5,Great Reliable Service,The Pittsburgh Steeler's terrible towel was delivered in time for the holidays and it was in great condition. It brought a joyful smile to the recipient's face.
5,TERRIBLE TOWEL,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother who is Steelers fan. He loves it! When he opened it, he immediately started swirling it around his head. It was hilarious!"
4,Terrible towel - Steelerws,this was a gift to my daughter but I thought it was nice. She likes anything to do with the Steelers
2,A bit odd looking,I know my Terrible Towels...I'm from Pittsburgh after all. And the writing on these towels looks too big...takes up most of the towel with the writing. But I guess no one's really looking at the size of the writing as you swing it over your head at the stadium!
4,steelers towel review,I love my steelers towel. Everyone needs a steelers towel lol... it came on time and i am very satisfied with the product!
1,MUST READ: PROOF of POOR POWER,"I had a Sharp 700w which heated water in 1.52 minutes. At work, the GE Sensor 1100 watt heats water in 1 minute. So, I bought the Sharp R-308JW and it heats water in 2 minutes [TOO SLOW]! I kindly wrote the company which told me not to use the WARMING option. I kindly wrote back and told them I was always using full power. They never replied again. I used to soften a half gallon ice cream in 11 seconds on the old 700w oven, but this new one takes 20 seconds ON FULL POWER. Sharp is DULL indeed.I gave it away to GOODWILL and bought a GE."
3,I prefer Mancini Country,"I normally vote 101 Strings orchestra over anything else but in this case, I prefer Mancini Country.I purchase all from Amazon."
2,Yawnnnnn...,"I am not opposed to pop-clasical crossover efforts (e.g., I like most of the Opera Babes CD), but see no point in this album. ""Shapes"" offers very sleepy versions of mostly over-familiar classical/baroque pieces, none improving in any way on conventional, unmodified performances or other pop-classics efforts. (For example, compare the fine performance of Satie's Gymnopedie #1 by Blood, Sweat, & Tears with Miller's emotionally/sonically flat version.)Also, Miller's guitar performance displays nothing of his musical personality (maybe he has none). Dom, if you're going to do classical pieces, you need to play them straight, or add some interesting pop flavor/color. This bland, inoffensive approach is uninvolving, hence pointless."
1,Not the worst movie I've ever seen...,"That award goes to ""Rawhead Rex"" which is amazing in its horribleness. This deserves an honorary mention though. It's really, really bad. All I can say is, Bruce D., you're way too good for this."
1,SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!,Do not purchase this movie thinking that you are about to see anything closely related to the original Titanic! This movie should not even have the name Titanic in its title! This movie should not even be associated in any way with the word Titanic! I watched this movie on Syfy and I honestly thought to myself 'What a joke!' - no one should ever waiste their time or money on such mess like this!
2,Trash but not entertaining at all,"I actually like trash movies if they have some style.But this one is so badly written, filmed and played that there is no entertainment value in it at all.I did see 2 more movies of this studio that have at least entertained me in a certain way. This one didn't.Bad acting (no surprise), bad special effects and simply extremely boring.Don't touch!"
1,Titanic 2,"Was too much computer graphics, storyline, acting, and just a terrible movie...tried to make it similar to the first and falls flat on everything."
1,Not Worth to Watch it!,"I watch this with my sister, because i love the story of the Titanic and wanted to see how they made this video. Sorry to say I wish I could get back the time that I wasted watching this movie. The acting was so bad. They didn't even try to lose themselves in the roles that they were playing in. There are some scenes were you cannot even tell were the main people are because it was so dark. I must tell you that I will never buy this movie. Don't waste your time on this movie you will regret it."
2,Talk about cheesy effects!!!,"What a major bummer this one is. Acting was subpar, special effects finished it off. What can one expect from Syfy, and Asylum? I would like to see a good Titanic 2 done right. I have noticed that most of Asylum's handy work is pretty tacky. The Titanic movies, even the older ones offer a much better cast of actors, and even special effects. Do yourself a favor, wait until the price of this movie comes down a bit before you buy it. Then you won't be out of a whole lot of money! It's that pathetic. The only disaster here is the movie itself."
1,"The dumbest thing I have ever seen, what a waste of time!","I almost never spend time on reviews but this time I could not resist - this is something! The cheap effects and idiotic scenes were funny at the beginning, but got really irritating towards the end. It is a mockery of the original movie and disrespect of the people who spent $3 and 2 hours on it.I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,SINKING SHIP,"Writer/director/star Shane Van Dyke apparently has an ego bigger than James Cameron in updating the original. Wih cheesy special effects, minimal acting talent and a preposterous script, this movie is a poor imitation.One time Oscar nominee Bruce ""Willard"" Davison tries hard but his role is so poorly written, he's like the title boat--he's sunk.You can laugh along so it's not a total loss!"
1,One star is rated to high!,"I wonder what the cost of this movie was to make. I sure hope the actors did not get more than $0.50 a day while it was produced. I am sure it was shot in about a week. I must say that I feel cheated as I paid way more for this movie than it was worth.. in fact, I would not own it if they paid me to take it had I know how bad it was!"
1,Better left at the bottom of the ocean,"Ok...I actually bought the instant download of this, and actually watched it through once. I revisited yesterday, like other Titanic buffs I had to have everything Titanic related. I only got to the point where they treated an injured victim by taping a credit card from the rich ship owner to the wound... Thank God she was willing to take something besides American Express! And you should take my advice and keep whatever credit card you use in your pocket and skip this pathetic movie with poor special affects and even worse acting and script.Sorry,jr"
3,This wont sink as DVD entertainment !,"Stars: Bruce Davison and Brooke Burns.Shane Van Dyke ,wrote & directed.""HOLY Queen Mary"" !, Not a fan of poster...But of everything else Titanic 2.Marie Westbrook steals every scene she is in,and deserved she is in almost all.Bruce Davison in awesome father role and has some nice scenes,Wish Brooke Burns could have supported him more in those.The effects are really good and makes film look bigger,Could we get more people in peril please .The `Queen Mary' attraction in San Diego,Ca. is used mostly as stand-in for TITANIC 2 ship scenes and some CGI when in deep water.The ending is shocking and jaw-dropper, Really DON'T ANTICIPATE !"
1,didn't sink fast enough,"When a director{van dyke} is in his own movie BEWARE! Its cheap the acting is juvenile and laughable.Its painfull but at times entertaining,BUT not long enough.Sad because it could of been a camp classic like Plan 9 from outerspace or glen or glenda instead its just a painfull experience.The quote in here was History repeats itself when the first wave hits lets just hope titanic 3 never leaves dock."
1,Terrible,"That is the one word you can use to describe this series. There is few good actors and mostly bad actors. It has some hope in the first 5 seconds, but then goes down a slippery slope. We can't forget about the bad CGI to."
1,Not good,"Not good enough to watch again, rent don't buy if you must watch it, but be advised you'll be sorry."
2,BAD,"I LOVE anything Titanic, so that is why I bought this movie. Let me tell you, so not worth the money it was to buy. Keep looking!!!"
1,Hilarious. Take your iPhone and record a bath toy sinking in the Bath tub... much more realistic,"One of the most horribly made ""D"" movies I've ever seen. To the point that it's almost hilarous. I think a couple of drunk dudes with an iPhone and iMovie made this one night with a 30 (not million) dollar budget. You will laugh all the way through it. I love the part where they tape a credit card to a bleeding blonde bimbo's chest to keep her from dying during the sinking. This has to go down as a true cult classic."
4,titanic ii,it waqs pretty much action packed and kept us wondering what was next....very good movie would definetly recommend it to all ages
3,Not great but not a bad mockbuster,"I found myself quite impressed with this. It's not a great film, and it's certainly ridiculous at times, and the ending is largely cribbed from two different James Cameron another movies (not Aliens or Terminator 2, tho--that would have been awesome!), but it largely did what it set out to do. Bruce Davison spends the whole movie in a helicopter, but he does a good job regardless."
5,Until That Time,"I stand convinced this collection of thought-provoking, healing, and heart-touching tunes was a gift from God. The gift of Bill Connet's CD came through many channels to one most in need. The folksy melodies take me back to bluegrass festivals of my youth in Iowa and verify the scripture, clergy and family wrought miracles that have saved this prodigal Iowa son, bringing him home to his Father. Thanks, Bill, for the Peace that passes all understanding."
4,"""Until that Time"" --has arrived.","Anyone familiar with the Des Moines music 'scene', has known Bill and his talent for many years. The voice and his instrumentals are now joined with original lyrics gleaned from his life experience. Bill speaks with a voice from the heart in describing his own, and his father's, much too abrupt awareness of the temporal nature of their lives on this planet. By letting us know them in such a moment, and the joy and excitement in the life we all share, we are urged, and guided, into dancing, and singing, and enjoying, 'until that time' comes for all of us."
5,Still a great text,"I have had this text for many years. The Raspberry Pi has prompted me to go back and re-learn c. As others have mentioned, this text is a work of art, almost like the author is writing on a blackboard. It is clear and profusely illustrated. A great way to learn. The first program on page 3 is a function loan payment and interest calculator. It works great. Just be sure to link the math library with -lm when using gcc to compile. If you use g++, it links it for you."
2,CALLAS technical quality POOR,"Although the interviews, etc., with and about Callas are excellent and enlightening and very interesting, the technical quality of this DVD is poor, out-of-focus shots, many blurry, and so it is difficult to recommend this dvd. Why didn't the people responsible for the technical quality use the same equipment and techniques as those by Maximillian Schell when he made the technically perfect and beautiful DVD with Marlene Dietrich, in his documentary about her called, ""MARLENE""? THIS ""CALLAS"" NEEDS REMASTERING, both picture and sound!"
1,Only Because 0 Stars was not an Option,"I watched it once. I took it to the used cd store. They told me they'd give me $4.00 for it. I told them, ""No more than $2.00. It sucks."" We settled on $3.00. This is a cobbled-together bunch of interview segments by a bunch of British guys that I didn't even catch the names of.I didn't think much of THE MOON YEARS, either, but at least it had some more coherence to it."
1,STUNNING in its terribleness! (Only for Who completists!),"This is a 40 minute DVD of three old british guys talking about how much they love The Who. History of the band is covered, but there's nothing in this DVD that can't be found - and presented better - elsewhere.The ""documentary"" is literally close-up shots of three quite frankly ugly, uninteresting english fellows. This video consists of mostly only these three gentlemen talking. (Occasionally, they'll break from the talking heads and show some Who footage, which isn't even that interesting. Number 1, the videos can be found elsewhere, and number 2, no Who audio is included. You are stuck with a bland elevator rock music substitute playing in the background.) I got real sick of watching this very quickly.I would only recommend this DVD for Who completists."
4,Soulful Mexican Songwriting,"This is a beautiful album. Great harmonies, surprisingly interesting guitar-work. My only complaint is that it is rather short. Other than that, a great (and inexpensive!) introduction to this wonderful band."
4,eye-catching scarf!,very nice and eye-catching piece. order came in promptly. thinking of getting a couple more soon.
5,Clear Mascara--Brow Tamer,Sometime back I discovered that filling in thinner spots in brows with a light brown and then blending with clear mascara tames and corrects in one fell swoop. Excellent product and fair price.
2,Plastic Head Do Not Use for Heavier Cameras,I have had this tripod for awhile. It does has smooth swivel head and ideal for a very lightweight camera not a Canon EOS or similar Nikon (about 3-4 pounds). The plastic head snapped today and the camera whacked against the stand. Luckily it didn't fall to the ground. Cheaply made. Lightweight and very portable. Should have brought the Bogen with me today
5,"Guide to 1/1200 construction in plastic, with interesting histories","This book includes chapters on tools and construction techniques, as well as many useful plans and brief ship histories written in an interesting way. The emphasis is on plastic hull construction, which those currently using wood will find useful. The book assumes some model building experience, and so does not go into great detail on techniques. The several plans are adequate for 1/1200 and perhaps for up to 1/700 when provided or scaled up.1/1200 ships are in general not placed on bases."
1,Don't Bother,"For an introduction to 1/1200 scale modeling do not buy Ainsworth's WARSHIPS IN MINIATURE. His how-to chapter on construction techniques is weak as it is short. Bulk of book is sub-chapters on 40 different warships. Unfortunately for the modeler, plans are crude and most of the text a superficial gloss of ships' design and service histories. Modeling notes for each ship are brief and very few are of real use or interest."
4,Sylvia OH Sylvia,"Sex screen legend Syliva Kristel stars as the (in)famous legendary spy around the time of World War 1 (1914-1918). Masquerading as an exotic dancer, she gathers intelligence information for the Germans and later for the French. Sylvia Kristel's steamy sequences with stars Christopher Cazenove and Oliver Tobias are reason alone to buy this DVD. Recommended."
2,"Nice costumes, Dull story.","Leonard Maltin's movie guide commented that the life of Mata Hari must have been more exciting than this, and I can only agree. This Golan-Globus production has a nice WWI period setting and costumes and quite a lot of nudity, but the plot is talky and slow and rather dull. The film definitely has some qualities but it was not as entertaining as I had hoped."
5,"this is a great train set,","this is a great model train,love it,it runs great,easy to set up,anyone who is thinking of getting in to the hobby of model real roading should buy this.i give it 5 stars"
4,Good product,I am familiar with this particular train and the manufacturer. I was pleased with last one I had and bought this one for layout I am doing for my granddaughters.
1,Bait / Swith Shipping,"Watch the shipping from this seller, ehobbies. There are advertisments of no shipping charges, ordering dates and shipping are suspect and they accept no responsibility.I did not receive my order timely and my grandson missed the oportunity to have this gift Christmas morning. Great present for a six year old.I rated every catagory a one star due to the seller. Have not opened yet as was trying to return with a refund with no success. ehobbies has an answer for everything.Why not a catagory for rating your satisfaction with the seller."
1,A Lesson in Frustration,"So I bought this set for my son expecting an electric train set he could enjoy, but wrong. This set is an exercise in frustration. Here's why....1) First the wheels on all cars except the locomotive easily fall off. Requiring constantly stopping and putting back on.2) The locomotive's wheels do not stay firmly on the track and easily ""derails"" when you run at mid speed or above.Combine 1 and 2 and you have a worthless train set. My question to Bachman is this: DO YOU TEST THIS JUNK BEFORE YOU SELL IT TO CONSUMERS???"
2,birthday present,"My daughter liked the fact she finally received a train ecspecially for her birthday, except it doesn't stay on the track long enough to count to ten."
2,Maybe for an older child...,"My 4-year-old son received this set as a gift and was ecstatic when he opened it, as he loves trains. So, in that sense it was worth the price.However, this set is not durable at all. I think one of the coupling hitches was broken right out of the box and several others followed suit in the next few days so that now, I think three out of the five cars that came with the set are unusable.Plus the wheels of the cars pop out easily. An adult can pop the wheels back in - providing your child hasn't stepped on them already. Also, the slightest bit of jostling derails the train and it's not easy for a young child to re-mount the trains on the tracks properly.Perhaps if my son was a few years older it would have been enjoyable for a longer period of time. As it was, he got about a day's enjoyment out of it. If you have the money, go for a larger scale (O guage) train set - I seem to remember those were a lot more solid."
4,Good buy for price,"Wanted a Christmas tree train and this works just fine. Didn't realize that there isn't a train whistle (maybe there is an accessory?) but would rather no whistle than an annoying whistle. The engine stays on very well, but the cars don't do as well at fast speeds. I do let my 4 yr old adjust the speed and direction and he's very excited about it and just knows that he can't mess with the train or cars. He's wanted a Christmas tree train for a long time and I'm happy to find an electric train at a good price."
3,Bachmann Train,I for some reazon you drop a car the wheels are very easy to be removed. You might loose them.
5,Very Nice,"HO scale trains are very hard to find nowadays. 20 or 30 years ago, every department store had them. Now, you might find them in a lot of hobby stores but at a premium price. This is a nice set at a very nice price."
1,Not recomended.,"This train set is cheaply built and not worth the money. The rail cars are extremely difficult to connect together and it is also very difficult to get the wheels to sit on the track properly. The engine and cars derail very easily. We have triplet boys so we bought 3 trains. Each train is as poorly built as the other, so it's not like we got a dud. They are all manufactured equally bad. The only good thing that I can say is that it runs smoothly until it derails and the power supply seems to operate well. I still have a TYCO HO train set that I bought in 1977 and its quality is far superior to these new ones."
2,Poor quality,"This train is not very good. I bought it for my nephew. When you put the engine on the track, the cattlepusher touches the track. Do not waste your money."
3,"Not as much ""flash"" as some V-Flash products","Boght this recently since we like the other V-Flash smart discs, but we were disappointed. Our 6 year old quickly became bored. There were a lot of question and answer games but not that many action games."
2,?really?,This product has alot of bugs. My daughters have to wait like 5 mins before going to the next scene. It also has other loading issues...Did not really meet my epectations.
4,Very enjoyable workout and time goes by quickly.,"Easy to follow with approx. 4 minute warm up, 40 min. step aerobics, 2 min. of squats, 2 min. stretching. This tape is great when you really aren't in the mood to work out. It starts out slow with about 9 min. of extremely basic stepping (you might want to use hand weights in the beginning to get your heart rate up) and then moves into some powerful moves with some funky hip hop thrown in at the end. Gin Miller and her crew get you motivated, and it's really a lot of fun. When you're done, you feel great!"
2,Cut out all the chatter!,"This workout was a huge disappointment. I like a lot of the other workout tapes in the Reebok series, but I could've left this one at the store. The workout is much too easy for an advanced stepper and the continuous, mindless chatter is annoying. Very different from the latter tapes with Gin Miller where she is very serious and committed. If you want a good, serious, challenging workout by Gin Miller, try her Power Step and Intese Moves workouts, they blow this one away. If I wanted all the cute chatter Gin, I wouldv'e bought a Denise Austin tape."
1,I Didnt get my game,"I have ordered this game for my son since the day before black friday and have not gotten it yet I called amazon and they told me to contact him,so I did i have not gotten a reply yet.today is january 5th 2012 and i have not gotten the game."
3,my review,The game plays well. The first one was awesome and this one really didn't disappoint. I mainly got this game because it had broly.
5,DBZ review,This game has lots of strong spots in it and some weak spots.The game has over 30 characters all with good graphics. One of the weak spots is the part in story mode where you have to unlock Broly. It took me an hour to even figure out how to unlock him. In the game there is a part called free battle where you get to pick out your characters. You can also have up to three characters. Out of all my games this is probably my favorite one.
5,DBZ!! By a kid named Cheezo,"This game is the best DBZ game for a handheld system ever! It has awesome graphics and even more awesome characters. It surpasses the first Supersonic Warriors with more characters, longer story modes, and new special attacks and TEAM ATTACKS. The only downside is the fact that there is no shop, taking away replayability. U cant unlock songs, galleries, or anything other than characters. Overall a GREAT game."
5,Good as new,The product was better then described . looked like someone opened it once then mailed it out to me. Got it quickly.....nothing bad to say !
5,Fun game,I bought this game for my son as a graduatig present and ha absolutely loved it. He recommended it to all his friends.
4,"Good speakers, but not as good as i had hoped","I bought these speakers to complete a 7.1 surround sound home theater system. They are my left and right surrounds. There were a few things i dislike. 1) the grills are impossible to get off. First thing when i got them out of the box i wanted to look at the speakers, and i broke a peg off the grill. The fittings are made of rubber and they're way too tight. I sprayed WD-40 in all of them, and they still break. I'm so gentle now when i take them off, but they still break, and i'm down to 2 pegs on each, so i dont even put them on anymore. 2) these arent the most sensitive speakers in the world. I had to turn my other speakers way down, and these ones way up to get the balance right. But other than those things, they are very nice speakers. Good highs, mids, and decent bass for only having a single 6.5"" driver for low frequencies."
3,Too Squishy,"The pillow served better under my rear in the uncomfortable plane seat then for my head. I bought it so I wouldn't wake up with a stiff neck, but that's what happened!As another reviewer said, it needs more cushion. But then it can't be packed as small... course it wasn't that small to pack anyway! I ended up using the clip and attaching it to the outside of my bag."
3,samsonite travel pillow,"The pillow cover is removeable and washable, a nice touch. But the pillow itself was too soft. Perhaps adding some foam filling will make it firmer but it will also make it harder to pack into briefcases or other carry-on luggage. I would prefer an inflatable pillow as a travel pillow, and unfortunately this one isn't inflatable."
3,"OK for smaller people, but needs to be stiffer for adults.","I bought 3 for a family airplane trip. The kids loved them, but I found them to be too soft, not enough support."
4,A Natural Introduction to Motion Graphics,"Jon Krasner's approach to motion graphics is a natural for learning the medium as an artform and commercial process. Rather than simply teaching tools and how to mechanics as most books are prone to doing, he builds an understanding of the media from the bottom up-from ideas to execution with an experienced eye for the use of tools and special effects. The emphasis is on how to organize ideas and build a coherent, interesting visual animation using the tools.This book has the added advantage of retracing a history of motion graphics that will introduce the reader to the ideas and artists that pioneered the form and its evolution to the desktop digital environment. The author then introduces the reader to a wide array of processes and software applications for developing varied approaches to animation.It is as good an approach to the subject as I've seen, and a valuable introduction to motion graphics animation."
2,How else can you describe boring?,"This really is a very good book, but it has it's limitations and requires a narrow audience (not for everybody). It's written by a Propeller-Head who does little more than state the obvious. If you've been away on the planet Mars for awhile, then this book is a good introduction to the genre. Although it might stimulate some ideas, although there again it might not. If you've already got a good fix on where you're going and where you're coming from, in motion graphic design, look for something else with a little more depth and breadth."
3,Average Compilation,"People need to take this for what it is and not get so bent out of shape over genres and labels. I'll admit that I don't like all the songs on the CD, actually I can probably dislike half of them, but considering there is over 20 tracks and it cost me around $7 that isn't bad at all. It is definitely worth it, because the tracks I did like introduced me to bands I have never heard before. Which is precisely the point of compilation CDs. Personally, I liked the second Atticus compilation much better, but if you liked that one then you'll still probably enjoy this. It took me two or three listens until I warmed up to any of the tracks, so don't be quick to judge it.If you are just angsty because you thought you were going to get something you didn't, get over it and give the CD away to friend or relative. If you are really worried about getting your investment of $8 back, sell it to one of those used CD stores. However, I doubt that will be necessary."
5,worth the money by far,"7 bucks for this cd is one heck of a deal. this cd is amazing and continues in the atticus line of awesome compilations, though in a different, less punk way. with quirky bands such as bedoiun soundclash and the sounds and piebald this cd gains a new element. i cant really put it into words, but this cd is refreshingly new. some of my favorite include the songs by the sounds, bedouin soundclash, lucero, taking back sunday, rise against, MxPx, murder by death(this song represents a lot for me), lydia, gratitude, and pretty much everything on here. even if you buy this and find that you like only half of the songs (by the way every song here is uniquely different, something you dont find as much on the first two) it is still well worth the money. gotta love these compilations keep them coming"
5,Epic!,"Absolutely amazing in every way!This album contains a fantastic mix of punk, pop-punk, emo, and the like. As with all of the other ""Dragging the Lake"" albums; this one doesn't disappoint and it has been in my CD changer since I received it =]."
1,Micheal Sullevan knows nothing about punk,"This joker called blink-182 punk!!!!!!!! Give me a break, This is emo, And not punk. There are a few bands on here i like. But the rest is crap."
1,subpar production,"this would've been a good album if the production was alittle better , some songs were quiet and others were so loud they drowned out the vocals, garbage production"
2,The book has mistakes in editing,The book has a full page photo of a beaver and labels it as a badger(this may be reversed as the book is not where I can refer to it at the moment) I was disappointed in the book. It has been published for many years and still has errors.
3,Good series gets a bad transfer,I love the Cadfael series but this transfer to DVD looks like they took it off a second hand tape. Beware!
5,Always a pleasure to re-run,"As a long-time Brother Cadfael fan, I appreciate the excellent character acting, depth of detail and historic settingsfor this series and always find something I had missed in earlier viewings. Wish they would re-run it on PBS so I couldget friends and family to watch."
3,Another homerun by DePaola,"Longish, wordy book for DePaola, that may not be the best bedtime book (for a three year old) because of its length. But, as usual, the author's wonderful illustrations and attention to detail in re-telling stories is much appreciated. I am no Francis scholar, but I'd say it's in keeping with what we know to be factually and spiritually true about the Poverello. A must have for fans of DePaola and parents interested in teaching their children about this great saint."
1,Make it up as you go = feminist theology,Make it up as you go = feminist theology... all I could really say about it. Seriously - taking this line of thought pushed in this book: I might as well start my own church of our invisible lady of the car glovebox - because I find the mystery compelling and unfathomable.
2,Barcelona Clarinet,"We bought this clarinet for our granddaughter who's been playing for a couple of years. She (and we) thought a blue clarinet would be awesome. Unfortunately, they sent the wrong color but she also realized that it was plastic and would never be adequate for performance. Although they made a mistake sending the wrong color, we should have known that a clarinet for this price was probably not going to meet our needs."
3,"Interesting, written with feeling nostalgic yet lightweight.","Having taken this same trip in May 1998, I was quite intrigued by Professor Nersoyan's account of a trip through Eastern Turkey. I was able to retrace my recent experiences through his narrative of the towns and sites he visited with his friend Patriach Kaloustian who, a very long time ago was my teacher in the Armenian seminary in Jerusalem.I must say that the main reason I purchased the book was his mention in the title of his final destination- Aghtamar where the Church of Holy Cross stands proudly on this small island in Lake Van.I am surprised and disappointed that the author did not dwell deep enough on the subject. Having personally known of the author's talents,I expected that he would come up with a deeper more scholarly look in the past history of Aghtamar - the only standing Armenian church in Eastern Turkey."
3,Always Best of Irving Berlin,"The tape was suppose to be Strings Orchestra which to me would mean all music without singing. However, there were people singing at the end of the song. Very disappointed about the vocals. Tape purchased at Amazon.com"
1,Horrible quality.,"IF you are looking for a set of W.C. Fields shorts or films, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SET. I made the mistake of buying this set and I am thoroughly unhappy with the shoddy quality of this set. I filed a complaint with the manufacturers of this set, Passport Video, and they have refused to refund me. So do not buy any of their merchandise as their ""no refund"" policy seems to be an across the board business practice with them. Save your money and buy a quality film like ""The Bank Dick,"" or ""It's a Gift."""
1,I am not impressed,I expected more. This product just doesn't live up to the promoted qualities. Taste rather flat and not much flavor.
2,Ok coffee,"Purchased the 6 brick pack, I basically switched from a different brand (Kimbo) first brick was ok a little mellower not as strong as I would have expected, with second brick I found the first ""surprise"" packed toward the bottom there was couple lumps of an undefinable substance, not knowing what it was I decided to dump it out, 3rd brick was ok getting ready to open the 4th one.I won't buy this any more"
4,Good compromize,"The tripod is a good compromise between heavy-duty one and extremely light travel one. It is sturdy enough to hold modern high-end digital cameras. The legs can be well secured with the twist locks. Its weight is 640 grams and folded length is 40 cm. However, it is not that small to keep it on the belt (need a backpack). Generally, I have been quite happy with it."
3,It's an OK tripod but---,"Fully extended it is too short for someone 6'1"" tall. Takes too much time to set up full extension. Will not be used much because of this. Nice size when compacted. Is about what I expected for the money!"
4,A handy pocket reference,"A must for all writers. I use my thesaurus more than any other book, now that I own a spell checker. The name most famous in thesauri, ""Roget,"" is now in public domain, and Random House makes use of it here for quick reader's identification, as do most of the thesauri publishers. Ignore the confusion this creates and concentrate on the portability of this edition, one of its best features. It's easy to use and priced right."
5,perfect,"I read this book and realized i could become an expert bomber. After reading the first few pages, I learned a lot about bombs and fireworks."
3,Not bad but...,"I didn't like it. First understand that this book was written in two parts in 1941 and 1943. That in of itself does not make it a bad book. After all as the author state ""Principles of Chemistry do not change."" Very true, but the knowledge of safety and better compositions do change.Secondly, I estimate the book is approximately 30% history. And some of that is very ancient history indeed, giving compositions dating back to the 1500's. Of what use are these? It wouldn't be so bad if all the history was put in one chapter, but all this history is intertwined within the technical explanation so as to make studing very tiring.I give it 3 stars because there is enough technical information in the book for the price. But digging it out will be quite a chore."
4,An exellent introduction to Powder & Explosives,"I'm still reading the book. The truth is that its not what I was expecting, because the book was written about 194X during WW2, I had no idea until I recieved it! But its a very good introduction to the subject as it details the evolution throughout the years (of course, until 194X)"
4,The best smallest camera you can buy,"Great camera. Purchased it 2 months ago. Small, durable, and perfect for all environments and usages. Easy to use. Software is more than adequate to edit/manage photos. Comes w/ ARC software, not Adobe as described. Only negative is that I can't seem to download movies, so what is the use of taking movies?"
1,skating very close to fraudulent advertising,"Specs on the S110 claim USB connectivity. On purchase, the buyer learns that the camera's driver only works if the S110 is connected directly to the computer: no hubs, no other USB devices. In fact, the USB driver for the S110 cannot even be installed if a hub is in place. This violates the whole reason USB ports/protocols were developed: to permit daisy-chaining of peripherals. There is not the slightest chance the S110 is going to be my only USB connected peripheral.I am so disgusted with Canon, Inc. over this issue that I will never again trust anything Canon publishes or manufactures.So, if you never intend to use any other USB device -- go ahead. Buy the PowerShot S100. Otherwise, find another camera."
1,Failed in just 20 days,"I bought this camera for a Christmas gift but it did a bad job, because only 20 days after the purchase the zoom get clogged.I'm very dissapointed by this fact, and more by the fact that the guarrantie does not cover this faliure in [international city].The pictures are excellent but I think this camera was a very bad expense."
2,Almost worth the wait,Very good point and shoot camera in an elegant tight compact package with one problem that can be summed up in one word S_L_O_W! From the slow power on to the almost 2 second delay from the time the shutter button is pushed until the shot is taken. Also the shutter speed in anything other than full sunlight is poor. The software works well. The color accuracy is flawless with good resolution. The focus could be tighter; this may be a result of its poor performance in less than perfect light.
4,Great Camera but...,"I received this camera for Christmas and I really enjoy taking photos with it.Although I am still learning a few things about this camera, I am a bit dissappointed that it could only take 6 seconds of moving picture. I wish that it would take at least 3 minutes of moving picture instead of 6 seconds.It's too bad that the manufacturer has to milk you for more money to buy at least the 128MB CF card in order to get more than 6 seconds of moving pictures."
4,WARNING for Win2000 PowerShot users,"Several friends and family have purchased PowerShot 10, 100 and 110 cameras. In general we love them and have been pleased. BUT, there is a fatal flaw with the software supplied for running this application under Win2000. The application appears to work properly, but when shut down after doing a folder update (F5), the application causes your entire Win2000 system to shut down abnormally. In other words an immediate crash of the entire system results. As the application and system crash they corrupt the ZoomBrowser database, and so the application won't restart after a new boot. We found Canon support to be useless in debugging the problem. They deny it exists. (Note, all of our Win2000 installations are on IBM Thinkpads, and it's possible that this failure occurs only on Thinkpads.)The Adobe software that is/was distributed with the PowerShot also doesn't work with Win2000. Canon admits to that failure, but won't do anything to remedy the situation."
5,Canon S110,"I've had this camera for less than a week and I am very pleased with it. With 21 years experience in photography and working professionally 1/2 of those years, I've seen a lot, and this camera is a high quality tool. I can't say this camera is better or worse than the other cameras in the same class. For just breaking into the software, the STITCH program is excellent. The other software is still under review.It's great to be able to use this camera on TV and record on VHS tapes, the main reason I bought this camera, (over the Fuji 2600).Negatives:Battery life is short*No case included*I don't like the tripod mount on the corner. Does not seat it's self on a tripod as well as it could, (little annoyance)Installing the card reader and camera, it gave my camera a hickup. I think is was the reader.*Coupon for ""free"" case, 16 MB card, and batt.Buy a large Hard Drive"
3,"Decent photos, not too reliable, lacks attention to details!","I got this camera as a replacement for my giant (but wonderful) film camera when it first came out. It was great to just stick it in my purse and go. After a couple months the LCD screen stopped working. Even when I took a picture it would come up black on my computer. I sent it back to Canon and they fixed it. Wish it would've worked right the first time around.There's a lag between when you hit the button and when it actually takes the picture (results in some funny-looking posed pictures because people think the picture's already been taken!). It doesn't take very good indoor photos (flash looks harsh, doesn't focus well). And action shots are kind of a problem unless they're from a distance. The colors don't seem very true-to-life.I just got a photo printer and printed out a lot of photos taken with this camera and a few taken with a friend's newish Sony 4 megapixel camera. His photos were all much sharper and had much truer color."
5,Great things come in small packages,"Best camera I've ever owned, I love it's performance and it's small size allows me to take it everywhere in my pocket"
5,Nice update of the S100.,"I have been a dedicated S100 user since its release, and have really gotten my money's worth from that camera. It is not, however, a perfect camera, and the S110 attempts to address some of its shortcomings. However, what has not improved is the old 2:1 optical zoom, which admittedly is helped a bit by the 2.5:1 digital zoom, but still leaves me underwhelmed. On the plus side, the S110 adds a 30 second QuickTime (/w sound) movie function, which once you master the download process, really adds new zip to your internet photo apps, and the new control wheel with embedded power switch works far better than the old recessed power button, which in my mind was a real problem with the S100. The camera is priced exactly where the S100 had been, though worth considering still would be the now discounted S100. If you want a little more camera in a nearly-as-small pkg (and with the more powerful 3:1 optical zoom), consider the S300."
4,Easy to use,I have had this camera for a year now and it has been one of the best things I have bought. I have taken many photo's of the kids and they have printed beautifully. I really like the software - its easy to use. Other reviewers have had issues with the battery - mine lasts for ages but I don't use the LCD too much to review my shots. One complaint Canon should include a case also it does take time to turn on and off - you have to press the on/off button for a while and the camera doesn't always come on first time - I have missed a few shots because I thought the camera was on and it wasn't.
5,Used 1 year now,"After having used the S110 for a year I am still satisfied with its performance. It has worked flawlessly in sub-zero weather, and + 100 in car temps. I have a 16 mb card which I find will shoot approx. 35-40 pics in the med setting, and for all practical purposes if one is downloading and editing daily, that is all an amature or casual photo taker wants to handle, making larger cards impractical. It does a nice job on portraits, and will also do a good job of taking pictures of photographs you may want to copy! Main drawback with a small lense camera is on distant shots it tends to distort picture edges making a somewhat ""fish-eye"" appearance. If you are a casual photographer, and just like photos around the house and an everyday variety, this and the later models of the Elph type are indispensable for their durability and quality."
5,Only 1 Complaint,"I've had my camera for about 6 months. It is a great camera. It is sturdy and well built, very functional, and extremely compact. My only complaint is the photo software. When it works it is great software. To date it has failed 2 times. It is fixable, but with the help of tech support. Other than that, I have no complaints or regrets abuot buying this camera. I would highly recommend this camera to potential buyers."
5,Great Buy,"This camera is awesome! I had heard great things about Canon Digital and was impressed with the sturdy contruction of the S110. I love the Video funtion and was very pleased with the quality of this camera overall. My only complaint would be that the accessories (batteries, adapters, etc) are quite pricey. The battery life is terrible and the cheapest Canon battery I could find around was [price]. I recommend this camera to anyone looking for a compact digital camera with lots of features."
5,Point and Click Only Smaller,"I got my PowerShot S110. Its the perfect point and click digital camera. I dont mind not having 3x Optical zoom, although that would be nice, but how often are you going to be out of range where you would require 3x optical and use it? The image quality is great and the Flash is brighter then my Powershot S20 (3.3 mega pixel camera thats quite a bit larger)I wanted a highly portable camera and this is certianly it.The 8mb card isnt much but since the media is so cheap I Decided to go for the gusto and get a 128mb card which is way more then enough so its all good."
5,very happy with new S110,"This camera hits the spot. Just got it last week, a day before I went on vacation. It came in very handy on my trip. I purchased the small powershot case thats made for it, attached it to my belt and not a person I was with knew I had a camera until I pulled it out. Once out, everyone was really impressed with its size, ease of operation and functionality. If you want something with excellent quality and that's great for travel you will not go wrong here."
4,"Good camera, but too small for my hands...","I love the features and the resolution of this camera, but it just feels too small in my hands. I thought being small would be good, but I feel like my hands are cramping up when I use it. I would definitely buy a Canon digital camera again, just in a more comfortable size."
1,Utter crap,"How this game got released I don't know. The animation is slow and choppy, the graphics are cruddy, and the game itself just seems like a big joke. I played this for about 10 seconds before realizing what a horrible mistake I'd made purchasing it. It's sad, too, because I was really looking forward to a good motorcycle racing game on the Dreamcast. Buyer beware!"
1,"do not waste your time or money please,","This game I thought would be cool because the fact that it involves ducati's. I was wrong the worst graphic cliping I have seen on dreamcast bad graphic's, bad frame rate, horrible physic's and bad sound effects as well as music. I took it back the next day and echanged it for the best racing game I have seen on dreamcast. That was Test Drive Le Mans it is great I highly recomend it I was happy that Ducati was so bad and I had to exchange it after the first five minutes of test drive le mans I was hooked, that's a five star game not to mention it is only $... so run out and get it. Stay far far away from ducati if you enjoy quality games."
1,*** THIS GAME STINKS ***,"I totally agree with the other reviews. The physics in Puke-kati are lame. I'm surprised that Acclaim put their name on this one. Re-volt, another Acclaim game, is one of the best racing games I've played. Buy that one."
1,one of the poorest,One of the poorest excuses for a movie i have ever seen. I could believe it. Deleted it before it was finished
1,"Filthy, Filthy, Filthiest Movie",What a horrid waste of money. You can't even get into the movie without being drowned with cussing and lesbians. Couldn't watch it for the grossly overused foul language and lesbians. Skipped to the end to see the Undercover Detective outsmarted and murdered by 1 lesbian he's to protect. Why anyone would spend good money to produce this trash is beyond me. I spent less than 2 bucks to watch it for 7 days but deleted this movie instantly because it's nothing more than trash. Made me sick to get this junk in my head! I gave a 1 star rating because there's not a 0 star rating but this is definitely a negative 0 movie to me.
2,"This cd had the songs, but not the right format","I have been a big fan of the strings for some forty years now! They are good about turning out quality projects. Some of their projects are better than others, this being one of the others.This cd had the songs, but not nearly enough of the stings. This cd project focused on vocals primarly. I find this cd offended me, for I really enjoy instrumentals especially by the strings. I would have preferred an all instrumental cd. I know it is hard to always please everyone and I can understand their situation.Recommendation: I Would Like To Recommend This CD"
4,i personally find it interesting,"it was a good read for me.. simple concepts to grasp (though will take effort to commit to..), funny, interesting and made me look inwards... the author garnishes this book with personal notes and experiences, which i find interesting and gives the work a down to earth feeling..."
4,makes me want to try smoking plants,"The book is an absolute pearl. The gift of the author's stories is precious. To add to that, the information about the plants makes me want to try smoking some of them as soon as possible! The rhythm of the prose and the way the author has paced the brief statements, the stories and the information is calming and healing in itself."
5,A Great Day in Harlem Dvd,"This is a good DVD if you like the jazz artist who layed the foundation for this great music,informative interviews."
4,An utterly charming documentary,"A fun, informative documentary about the taking of a classic photo in 1958 for Esquire, that had almost every great Jazz star of the era, from Dizzy Gillespie, to Count Basie to Thelonius Monk, etc etc.While the film is too short (just under and hour) to go into any great detail, and maybe a little too much time is spent on various greats 25 years later saying how great everyone else was, there's a sweetness and infectious enthusiasm that director Bach (no spring chicken herself) brings to this collection of memories of a time and place.If you're into photography or jazz, this is a must-see."
5,A great day in history,"The brainchild of an Esquire magazine art director led to this wonderful moment in our cultural and national history -- almost 60 jazz musicians gathered on 120th Street in Harlem in 1958 for a photograph. This video draws on the memories of some of those who were there: Dizzy Gillespie, Sonny Rollins, Marian McPartland, Art Blakey, Gerry Mulligan, Milt Hinton, Bud Freeman among them -- to recreate the moment. Lots of film footage of the gathering and many touching moments are included, from Count Basie sitting on the curb with the neighborhood youngsters to Thelonious Monk's surprise showing -- late as usual. This was a monumental task, getting 60 jazz musicians to gather at 10 a.m., the equivalent of 4 a.m. in our world, and they did it! This video needs to be re-released, now if not sooner, for all of us who love jazz or want to learn more about its practitioners."
5,"an excellent ""technical"" video of Norman recording Carem","This outstanding video places you in the center of the recording of Carmen. Norman, always a great treat is superb in her interpretation, both vocally and musically, with a Carmen ""attitude"" I""ve not seen in the past. I have always critisized sopranos who take on or record messo roles (as if sopranos don't have enough great roles already), this is an exception. Norman's ""pure"" sound and range accepts and conquers the challenge of the role of Carmen. Her low chest voice will send you flying !!!! If that doesn't do it ... her very seductive interpretation of Carmen will."
2,Please,Really not that great of an album to begin with. tragety was a little better but not by much. Maybe seattle should stick to grunge music.
2,Please enter a title for your review,"If all you want from metal is a competent demonstration of generic thrashy melodic-death playing technique, this album won't disappoint, but if you require a band to come up with some distinctive memorable hooks or at least something remotely original to hold your attention you won't find it here. The squeaky clean production is typical of the current metalcore scene, offering some heavy crunch, but not a remarkable amount, and no grittyness. This is a redundant album by a useless band who should have broken up before they had the chance to even disgrace the Revelation roster, let alone jump on the At The Gates worship bandwagon. For a superior alternative check out And They Shall Take Up Serpents by Byzantine. Hell, even Avenged Sevenfold and Trivium are better than this mediocrity."
2,Buy the originals,"When I saw this album on the shelves of Wal-Mart(yes I bought it there). I thought what a cool collection. There were some real Classics missing Like "" Raped and Freezing"" 'I love the Dead"" 'Unfinished Sweet"" and more. But you can only fit so many songs on one disc so I bought it.However when I started listening to it I was highly dissappointed in the edited versions of some of the songs. Why would you take out the keyboard solo in ""Welcome to my Nightmare""?If you want to listen to some classic Alice get the original albums. Start with ""Love it to Death"" , ""killer"", ""School's out"" "" Welcome to my Nightmare"" and ""Billion Dollar Babies"" then go on from there. I tried to take the shortcut and got burned bigtime.Alice rules . Shame on you Rhino."
2,Not a true representation,"Where are classic tracks such as Raped & Freezin', Halo of Flies, Ballad of Dwight Fry? A greatest hits is just that, the hits. A best of should represent what the artist believes are his best tracks regardless of chart status. I look forward to the apocalypse when maybe, just maybe, a label will get this format right."
3,too good to be true,"I saw this at wal-mart, and was amazed at the amount of music on this disc. also, most of my favorite Cooper songs were on here so I decided to pick it up. I brought it home and started listening, there was something odd about some of these songs. they were edited!Now I'm not a purist by any stretch of the imagination but you do not mess with perfection. And yes these early cooper songs were perfect just how they were. now i know why they could fit so many songs on this disc. They tore out some of the cool instrumental passages and in some cases entire verses of songs. Shame on you Rhino, you guys are usually better than this.If you want to get a glimpse into what alice is about go for the original greatest hits package. it's not as extensive but they at least give you the whole tune. from there get the original albums. ""Killers"" is awesome. So is ""Love It To Death"", Welcome To My Nightmare"" ""Schools Out"" (My current fave) and ""Billion Dollar Babies:."
1,This sucks,"It looked promising - a 22-track Alice Cooper compilation. Boy was I wrong. This has almost none of the killer early stuff, and EDITED versions of songs throughout. Also, where are ""You're A Movie"", ""Skeletons in My Closet"", ""Raped N Freezin"", ""I Love the Dead"", and ""Feed My Frankenstein""??? Just another case of WEA/Rhino putting out ""product"" to placate the unaware. Do yourself a favor and buy ANYTHING other than this."
1,"Come on guys, you can do better than this",Alice Cooper the band is 100% better in every respect than Alice Cooper the solo performer. So why so many solo tracks? And the boxset is even worse! Please Rhino/WEA: a two disc best of Alice Cooper the group. Or maybe a four disc box with live tracks and rarities? Is this too much to ask??
5,Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Alice is the king, no waek moments in the whole albumall great songs, heavy and ballads as welleveryone should own a copyClassics and more classic form the father of shock rockThis is music, not the MTV bands that play todayWelcome to Alice nightmare"
3,Un-cooped & unimpressed!,Not recommended. Sound quality is thin and two dimensional and dynamics are compressed. Bass is lacking. There is no visceral impact here. Great collection of songs but a rather dull and lifeless playback. Let's hope MFSL produces a re-master of AC's vintage rock.
3,Fun but falls apart,"This was given to my 2 year old as a present. It is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart. The roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with. The concept is good, all the animals and farmer are built very well, but it's frustrating to me and my son that it won't stay together."
1,Not worth the money!,"This is my first review so bear with me. I was compelled to write it so that others wouldn't buy this toy.My younger son who is 2 received this for Christmas from his grandparents and it's truly a piece of junk. Let me count the ways:1) Made of flimsy plastic.2) The barn does not close completely. Also, just a few moments ago I ""closed"" it and the grey roof fell off when I picked it up by the handle. All the parts came falling out.3) The yellow cart doesn't stay on the tractor. Always unhooking.4) Hay loft falls off too easily. I'm always re-attaching it.5) The animals are not balanced. They fall over easily.6) Fence comes apart easily.7) When the barn ""closes"" the parts still fall out because of the windows and doorway. Ridiculous!I'm am so disappointed in this toy. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"We got this because we are dairy farmers and my husband is a very loyal John Deere customer. We were so upset with the quality of this toy! The haymow, roof and doors would not stay on, the walls wouldn't even stay together. The platform where you put the animals would make other animal noises, my boys played with it for about 5 minutes before my 4 yr old said, ""Mommy, this is a piece of junk!"" The only thing we liked about it was the corn they still play with that, but otherwise it was a waste of our hard earned money and a bad idea for John Deere to put their mane on this toy."
1,Very dissapointed,"This John Deere playset is so flimsy and frustrating to play with, nothing stays together, and I wished I never bought it!... Do not waste your money on this."
1,Disappointed! The John Deere name should not be on this poor quality toy,"My grandfather owned a John Deere implement dealership in Iowa, so my blood runs green and gold! I was soooo excited to buy this for my daughter, his namesake. It was purchased for her at birth and now she is turning 1. I just opened it and was very disappointed to see that none of the decorative stickers were sticky at all. I had to use glue to stick them onto the barn. Also, like other reviewers have stated, the plastic is warped, making the barn difficult for me to open and the roof doesn't line up well. This product is such poor quality! This Big Red Barn is a Big Red disappointment. It is a disgrace to the John Deere name!"
1,So not worth it,"This toy is a piece of crap to say it nicely. My 2.5 year old son is in love with John Deere and received this for Christmas. The farm animals done make sounds the way they are supposed to, the roof falls off constantly and the barn does not fully close. It has been sitting in a tote since Christmas time because every time my son tries to play with it he gets frustrated that it breaks and ends up in tears."
1,Quite possibly the worst toy ever,"I can also attest to the general crappiness of this toy. Parts are made of cheap plastic, which are difficult to assemble. Once assembled, parts easily fall off. The animals aren't weighted enough to remain standing, so they just fall over. To open the barn, you have to pretty much disassemble the roof, which a younger child would not be able to do, or would risk pinching his/her fingers. The only thing my son enjoyed playing with is the tractor, but even that falls apart easily. For some reason, the manufacturer decided to make the hood lift, but it pops off easily, and since there's nothing to see under the hood, it's pointless. The corn field is interesting, but the corn doesn't stand up on its own; it just flops over. You really can't store all of the parts inside the closed barn because there's an open side. Seriously, don't waste your money."
3,For the price-it'll do,"I just purchased the whole line of champion series from Jensen.They are all very good sounding speakers. The only complaint onthe line that I have is the C990 towers, they are short and looklike the center speaker (c210) with a side fireing 8in speakerbelow. For the price of them they'll do, but I found the C220bookshelf speakers to have superior sound and bass over the C990.For the money should have got 2 more of the C220."
3,"Great bargain, decent sound","Fine speakers to augment an existing system. Probably better when used in conjuction with another set of speakers and a sub-woofer. But an incredible value for someone looking for a pair of servicable, affordable, attractive tower speakers."
4,"Pretty good speakers, for price that is.","Just got them a few days ago (little disappointed, should of checked the measurements of the speakers out first but didn't) anyway, picture on page here makes them look pretty big, but when you get them they are very thin and not too big. They sound pretty good (wish though woofer was in front, instead of on side of speaker). I guess you can't go wrong with the price for two speakers at $50.00 each. Just don't put them next to a big entertainment cabinet or they will get lost."
4,"Kill the bad guy, take the loot?? Not precisely.......","This book consists of 8 linked adventures which you can play separately or one after the other, in any order the players or DM choose(es). At the beginning of each adventure, DM notes tell you which modifications to make to that scenario depending on which adventures the characters already went through. The plot of the 8 adventures revolves around the same idea (defeating the iron shadow), with many subplots in the way, that can be further developed by the DM into short adventures. The only but is the effort/treasure ratio, in my opinion. Players with non-good alignment will need some extra motivation which, however, can be easily provided by the DM. Overall, a very nice work, most enjoyable for the DM and players alike."
4,Lots of fun for the young(and mommy too),"I bought the video on a lark after seeing it on Amazon. Thankfully, my child loves it and I can hear him laughing at certain parts from across the hall. Worth the investment. Pictures are beautiful, and the tape teaches young children while entertaining them."
2,"Wonderful illustrations, but many problems","The book documents well the development of American coastal forts of what was known as the Third System. These Civil War forts were impressive works built of stone and brick. The drawings are excellent, but there are numerous historical errors in the details and several forts are mislabeled. A revised edition would be appreciated and make this a 5 star work."
1,"""Cold Summer Rain""",Boring movie that would only be worth purchasing if it were in the bargain bin and the cable was out.
5,Amazingly good music!,"This is one of my all-time favorite albums, and I've listened to it over and over since I got it."
2,Haltingly Poor Film; You don't want to finish it.,"The 2 stars go to the fighting monk and that's all; the rest of the movie is really poor. The 5 fighters couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag and you could care less if all of them are sliced into gong bao ji ding (kung pao chicken). Should be renamed ""The 5 Paper Tigers and a annoying girl can ruin your evening.""Seriously- go look at my List ""Kung Fu for the Sole"" for some great movies- all of which happen to be cheaper than this one.PS I am usually impressed in Xenon's Digitally remastered DVDs (actually made me buy this one)... but this falls well short in quality and selection."
3,I expected more,"The box art looks real good, but I have never really taken to those old-school ""comedic/slapstick"" kung-fu movies. The fighting here is good, but not special. Jack Long has appeared in ""7 Grandmasters"" and ""36 Deadly Styles,"" both two tiers above this one."
3,Deceptive part picture,"The picture is not Estwing B3-3LB with a 11"" overall lenght. It looks like B3-4LBL with a 16"" overall lengh. Estwing call it a drilling hammer with long handle and not shown in a 3LB weight."
3,Only the beginning books in the series,"This boxed set has two primers, a spelling book, and levels one through four. It does NOT contain levels five and above."
2,Later (Wiley and Son's version) preferred,"I have a boxed set of the Mott Media version and the Wiley and Sons version. The Mott reprint is from th 1830's and it has really rough graphics compared to the version from the 1870's or so. The content in more doomsday as well. Still in the 19th century style, the Wiley reprint is not dreary and dark, not only in print, but in content.I showed the two sets to my K son and he said the Wiley was ""grandpa's"" (indeed his GF and GM used it in school!). Shown the Mott Media, he said ""great-great-GREAT Grandpa"" and turned back to the Wiley reprint."
2,Good only when it works,"My review is also on the SV-2000 purchased from our local Sam's Club. While this item worked for about a month, and worked well, it has not worked again since. Trouble is starting the thing. I have called the company repeatedly and get this, they told me to hold the gas button down for 10 MINUTES straight to get the ""proper"" gas and air mixture. I practically passed out and the thing never would light. They then had me tear apart the hose and remove the propane filter. Now, they are thinking what else might be wrong. Beware, if you purchase one of these, make sure just because it works for a few weeks you do not throw away the box as you will not be able to return it.When it was working, it worked GREAT, but I cannot give this item more than two stars because of reliability and customer service!!!"
2,Not what you think,"This book is not about Abraham. It's written as if an evangelical pastor is leading you through steps of practicing prayer, and as if your on a religious summer camp trip. Some of his prayers and thoughts are good but don't expect to read much of anything about Abraham. The title is a magnet to suck you in."
1,very misleading,i bought this for a full size pickup and when it arrived it was for small trucks and nowhere in the info did it mention for small trucks only. would not recommend to buy this part and does not work very well when driving it gets loose after a few minutes.
1,Stay away from this game!,"This was absolutely the most frustrating game I have ever played. The graphics are great, don't get me wrong, but the controls and the silly things that your players will do with consistently were so aggravating. For one, every time a shot goes up, defensive rebounding is way too hard. Half the time your players will stand around dumbfounded and then maybe reach down and pick the ball up off the ground. On offense, players will occasionally just wander out of bounds if you are anywhere near the sidelines or baseline. And certainly don't assume that there is any realism to your players abilities. I was playing a friend, and Eric Snow of all people could drive and dunk every time he touched the ball, while Reggie Miller can't seem to be able to make a three to save his life. You tell me, is that realistic? Please rent this before you go out and buy it."
2,Don't buy it,"First off the players hunch like someone dropped a piano on them. Running out for the tip off looks like the old man 100 meter race. The announcer repeating the same thing until i turned his voice off. This being a game where you buy it thinking it is going to be a good game, when in reality it [is not]. A game where Mugsy Boges is throwing them down and Matt Geiger is draining the 3's. Playing on a harder difficulty and beating the computer is like beating games like NFL blitz. Just don't buy this game!"
1,bad laptop,Laptop worked one day then stopped working. I sent it back and got it back just too find out it still didn't work so instead I jus went out and bought a new toshiba laptop that doesn't dissapoint me
2,Needs an upgrade,The book is a good resource however it comes with an old floppy disk. This should have been converted long ago. I can't even find a computer with a floppy disk drive to be able to even view what is on the disk.
5,A book of legend,"The Twenty-Fifth Hour is much more known in French than in English; few English translations are available today and it is regrettable that the book was never published in pocket format. Anyway, this book is excellently written in English and provides all English literate people with a unique opportunity to stroll the very special universe of the author, C. Virgil Gheorghiu, read a tragic but beautiful story, and muse over the visionary thoughts of Trajan, the poet who anticipated the world of machines that is being shaped today. A great book."
5,So tough it lasts forever,"The Estwing hammers are built tough, they last for decades. My drywall hammer was purchased more than 20 years ago and is still as good as new. I don't do drywall every day, only for my own appartment repairs, but if you have to do the job you need the best tools. It's balanced about right, the blade is tough for chopping stuff out of the way, and the face has just the right dimples."
5,Best in context of World Christian Encyclopedia,"Originally, the World Christian Encyclopedia (WCE) was intended to be a 3-volume set. It eventually became a 2-volume set, however, and this is the text that was to be in the 3rd volume. This text interprets the data that is present in the WCE, and presents much of the background material that makes the WCE really useful. WCT has enough of its own data to stand on its own, but it doesn't have the country-by-country data present in the WCE. Likewise, WCT contains many of the code tables and methodologies that are not enumerated in the WCE."
2,Disrespectful of smaller religions.,"If you are a closed-minded member of Christendom's juggernaut, this book is for you! If you want unbiased truth about smaller groups, you'll have better results from other publications."
4,handy,We used this book recently in oahu. My biggest complaint is that it was not helpful in choosing our Waikiki hotel as the descriptions are too vague. But there are helpful hints and they do tell you where to get the best mai tai. I am glad I brought it along but it is not good as an only guidebook.
2,Defective,"This may be one of the best books on Oahu, but only if it contains all the pages. The printing I bought was missing about 30 pages in the middle of the book. Since I bought it close to my departure date, I couldn't get a replacement in time to take with me. Don't publishers ever check the production runs?"
5,Liked it very much,"It is resourceful, useful and honest (the most important)!!Thank to it we made a very good plan for our trip!Recommend!!"
4,Values for children,"Corazon is a good book for children, but I guess very few of them read it now. It is about the most basic values of love for parents, other kids and people in general. The stories are moving and call to your heart, but this world is moving fastly out of that kind of reading and into the violent heart of today's life. It is the diary of a young kid in Italy at the end of last century, and every month the teacher reads them a story which talks about a specific value."
2,Urine Gone with Black Light,Product seems to work well. The black light fell apart as soon as I took it out of the box.
1,Junk. Don't buy.,"The product was defective -- the blacklight would not even turn on.I sprayed the whole bottle of solution on one modest-sized area of the carpet, and it didn't remove the smell.I bought this item at Lowe's, and I'm glad I did, because they took it back with no questions asked."
1,Does not work and light is useless,"The light that comes with UrineGone is useless however I have my own blacklight. The product does not work on fresh or old pet stains. I have a 14yr old dog that is incontinent and is now in diapers. I had lots of spots to test. I have tried over 8 different products and none of them would remove the stains under blacklight from carpet. The walls wipe down fine. I tried Urineout, Resolve, Nature's Miracle, OxyClean and a few others I can't think of. I am amazed that Urine Gone gives you a blacklight that shows the product does not work, if your light happens too. If you have pets invest in a decent blacklight if you want to make sure things are clean."
2,Urine Gone,"The Urine Gone works very well, as I expected. The black light I received with it only worked for 2 days, and not very well. The contacts on the bulb won't stay seated."
1,"If you want a black light for fun, it's worth it.","This will always show where pee has been, even after it has been cleaned. Check with the company. It also will ruin your rug. It's the worst product! Zero Odor or Bac Out are much better. My kids had a blast with the black light!"
2,More of a history book,This seemed more like a history book about who and why rather than a guide. I was looking for guidance on how to follow a vegan or clean diet.
4,The title speaks for itself!,"Learn from the Creator! This book is a real treasure in that the price paid was about one third of the original price! For people who wish to learn how to keep healthy, and lose weight. Our society needs to get away from fast foods!"
4,worth the read,"This book has lots of good tips and info if you are interested in a ""Clean"" way of eating. Good book."
3,Interesting book,This book is very interesting and done from a father's perspective-really makes you wonder how this family survived this type of hardship but they tell a good story!
2,Not really a triumph,"It's funny how we seem to have a need to say someone ""triumphs"" over a disease. Noah remained severely autistic and now lives in a group home. His social skills are extremely limited and he will never be able to take care of himself. I get so tired of the ""triumph"" thing, because living with a condition like this is so much more difficult and complex. We don't ""conquer"" everything, and in fact most chronic diseases have an ebb and flow to them, a little bit better, a lot worse. But that doesn't play well in our culture. It seems to embarrass people, or scare them too much. But isn't it much braver to live with this kind of challenge day by day for the rest of your life?"
2,Needs something,"This text isn't awful, but it does jump into things a bit quickly for someone who hasn't taken algebra for about a decade. If you need to use this text as part of a college program, I definitely recommend ""Forgotten Algebra"", ISBN 0812019423 as a refresher (or suppliment) before tackling this text. It will be well worth the extra [money] spent!"
3,"The idea is good, but....","For 12.00, I guess it is a fair value. Both pieces have a nice weight to them. It's very obvious they were hand painted by someone just learning this skill and did not have enough grape paint to have the grapes match on each piece. The trivet has brown grapes and the spoonrest purple.I was going to give this as a gift, but would be to embarrassed to do so."
2,........disappointing.........,"I saw And One in a show in Cleveland touring with VNV Nation and some other horrible group I didn't catch thier name. But I was impressed with AND ONE and thier stage presence. The music cracked and I was entranced...but sadly, they had sold out of cd's at the show. I had not heard thier music before that night. But the energy caught me off guard!So I sought high and low...and had this import sent in from Finland....and I am disappointed. It all sounds very nice and smooth...and bubble gummy. Where was the edge I heard that night? I now have 3 of thier cd's, and have found a few songs on each I like, but I can't listen to very much..it's just too sweet and poppy...not enough hard edge. The sound is way to close to Erasure, ABC, and Depeche Mode to make me see a personality of thier own. But they had a dynamic one on stage.Maybe it will grow on my....but..."
1,This book is filled with the Doctrine of devils!,"This book is an indictment against God. Paul's thorn in the flesh was a demonic spirit. The word ""messenger"" used there is the same word that is used over and over in the Bible for Angel.2Cor 12:7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.How much clearer could this verse be? ""the messenger of Satan,""God was telling Paul that he had been given authority over the devil, and he should use it.John 10:10 says, ""The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."""
3,Not what I expected,"I have nothing against tv evangalistic programs, yet I didn't expect this book to be a TBN release."
5,Very relaxing even for adults and their dogs,"The music put the grandchild to sleep in the crib. It calmed my stressed toy poodle; her heart rate actually slowed as she fell asleep on my lap. And, I was amazed how relaxed it made me feel as well. Really, don't drive with this one!! Do use it yourself otherwise!!"
4,It's GOOD!,"This is a good disc all around. The music is ""purer"" classical (vs. the reworked Einstein lullaby discs - that are a little too ""kiddie"" for me - the mother!"
3,The Real Controllers,"Apparently, some of the reviewers are mistaken regarding the identity of The Controllers. This is the group from Fairfield, AL (a suburb of Birmingham;USA). Their biggest hit was ""Somebody's Got to Win, Somebody's Got to Lose"". It seems one reviewer is on target. Lawrence ""The Music Man""."
1,letters fall off,"the plate is on my trunk,when i close it the letters fall off,there are black letters imbedded in the word nissan and are falling off,just had the plate for a few weeks,i dont recommend it"
5,Real Burnt Nuts!,"I purchased these for my Husband,He LOVES them,says they are the best He's ever had!He said they have a real ,but faint ,burnt taste!In no way appalling ,just good.So of course I tried them,they ARE GOOD!"
5,AMBITIOUS EFFORT THATS HAUNTS NOW MORE THEN EVER,"wonderfully touching story with a great detail oriented director and soulful performances from the cast, rainer strucker's exceptional pleading eyes and lost boy looks add to the sheer loneliness of his character. his performance is haunting yet strong. this is a love story between a west berliner and his east berliner boyfriend. becasue of the timeframe it was made in(cold war eighties) it very realistically and in great detail describes and reveals the different lives of the lovers and the emotional traumas associated with petty beauocracies. these petty laws that keep them apart politically as well as physically. now, since the wall came down its taken on a historical feel,to show what once was. one wonders what ever happened to these characters as the ending leaves the answers up in the air. this is a great film with historical significance not just for its gay subject matter but its place in social history."
3,Not so essential,A great addition to my library. A book I will repeatedly use and refer to --- at a great price. Thank you Amazon.
3,Good book but ? Kindle book,"A good book. Great colour charts, but on my Kindle they were black and white, the writing was too small and I couldnt blow up the font size because it didnt recognise the hand writing. I dont feel this book is really suitable as a Kindle book."
5,Perfect companion for the watercolor artist!,"This is THE book that every beginning to intermediate watercolorist must have. I have been studying watercolor for several months, and I learned more from this book than I did in all of my classes combined. The author has a lovely sense of humor, making for a fun read while sharing so many of the tips and tricks he learned from decades of painting and teaching. There are detailed pictures demonstrating his techniques, as well as tips on how to choose paints, paper, and brushes. If you can only afford one book this month, it should be this one! And after you have read this one, check out his other book: ""The Watercolorist's Essential Notebook: Landscapes"". Yet another fantastic book by this gifted artist and instructor!"
2,Not Great,I teach music to preschool age children and I have two of these xylopipes. Each one broke the very first day of use. The long yellow pieces of plastic covering the pipes came apart almost immediately. Now one of the red pipes has broken free. I have an extensive range of instruments that I use with my children and these were the only one's I've had problems with.
5,A Book That Would Satisfy ANY Scorsese Fan,"I bought this book out of respect and deep admiration for Martin Scorsese. What I got was keen insight into a creative genius. The numerous interviews reveal a side to Scorsese that not many people see outside the camera. It's a lot more personal than that. When he talks about his movies, he ultimately parallels them to what his life was like at that time. So it's a fine blend of his personal life mixed with his professional life. There's also the obvious vibe that this man always was and always will be a student of film; his passion is infinite. Perhaps that's what makes him as influential and well-respected as he is.You're the best there is, Marty!!"
5,Scorsese guides you through his life and american cinema,"I thought this was a very good book, an essential for any scorsese or film buff. It's hard to take your eye's off it once you start you become entranced."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"I'm not a big guy, so I was surprised that within a few weeks the pillow had already started to loose its shape. In the end it caused me so many problems with my back that I had to stop using it. Such a waste of money!"
5,memory foam pillows,"I don't understand the reason for the bumpy design of these pillows. I guess they're supposed to fill in the space between your neck and shoulders. I've tried them both ways up, and I still haven't figured out which way I like them; however, they are comfortable and don't fight back, putting pressure on your cheek or ear, and that must be the reason I can say asleep longer on these pillows than on the many other kinds I've tried in my quest for a good night's sleep that seems to come with aging. The wonderfully soft cover is a plus! I still revert to my down pillows sometimes, but it's great to have these as part of my ammunition against wakefulness."
1,Very Very bad pillows,Loose shape and becomes literally towels within 3 months of use.Total Waste of money and shipping.
1,These pillows are uncomfortable,"These pillows are too soft and too small. They don't provide adequate neck support, and are more uncomfortable than the pillows I bought them to replace."
3,Essential music? Not really. Beautiful? Of course.,"Travis seems to have gone the way of Radiohead's first album. Beautiful music, beautiful harmonies, beautiful vocals before experimentation. Who can blame them? It sells British records. The difficulty is simply that; its not very difficult music. It rolls into your ears and through your head and out the other side. Its not annoying Britney pop, and not aggressive Pink pop, its not showy Christina pop, and most certainly is not the Backstreet or *NSync travesty that rule the airwaves.It is different, and that may be the most compelling reason for American audiences to snatch up this record. None of the songs are as compelling as their previous effort, The Man Who, they nevertheless are less whiny, less grating. Its music to study to, to fall asleep to, even to wake up to. Its when company comes over or you've got time to really listen to music that you'd be best off removing it from the CD carousel.So its a guilty pleasure? You bet."
1,>>tHe DemiSE<<,"I really loved The Man Who, and even though i wanted to think this album was as goos as TMW, i knew it wasn't true, even before i opened it. it actually took me a week to get up the courage to listen to it, because i was absoloutely terrified it would not be as good as the first. when i finally listened to it, i felt like crying. THIS IS THE DEMISE OF TRAVIS.The album has two good songs. ""Sing"" and ""Pipe Dreams"". how is it possible that they went from being an amazing band making the perfect album with 10 perfect songs (+ a killer bonus track) to being a one hit wonder-album type band. it makes me really sad. do yourself a favor and buy The Man Who"
2,Invisible Band soon,"Travis will be an invisible band if this album is any indication of their future. This albums is a mediocre offering from a band who have had two stellar albums to date.I've seen Travis in concert and am a big fan of the band, but Invisible Band lacks the raw energy of their first album or the sonic depth of the second.Rarely do you hear the electric guitar over the acoustic. The lyrics lack the poinancy of Why Does it Always Rain on Me.This album is vanilla. Every track is like the last and the band never shows the energy that these youths have in them.How would I describe it? ""[junk] rock?""...""No, not quite""...""Wuss rock?""...""That's it."" (apologies to the Simpsons)If I had to guess, I would say that Travis is trying to take advantage of the Boy Band craze. Pipe Dreams has the most potential of any of the tracks...a Leonard Cohenesque song, but where the track could really have some punch like XTC's ""Dear God"", it pulls back and ruts in cliches and the same old crap."
5,Travis at their Peak,"The Invisible Band is Travis' commercially most successful album, and many would argue that this also applies in artistic terms.Three tracks from the album reached the top twenty, and the songs ""Sing"" ""Side"" and ""Flowers in the Window"" requires no further presentation.Among the other tracks the album ""Follow the Light"" is a favorite, this song undoubtedly had the potential to get the album another hit. The strongest track of the album, though, is for me the closing track ""The Humpty Dumpty Love Song"" - which begins just like it was just a bonus appendix for the album; nothing could be more wrong which you will realize as soon as the overwhelmingly moving chorus first is sounding.All in all a really strong album, where some of the songs might suffer from having been played too often."
4,"so much for the ""difficult third album""...","If you've ever seen Travis live, you know that they really seem to enjoy making music. Even the somber tracks on ""The Man Who"" are performed on stage with real energy. ""The Invisible Band"" is a sunnier album than ""The Man Who,"" but without the raucus, exuberant energy of ""Good Feeling."" Travis have grown up and matured, and it is evident from the first listening. Overall, I really like TIB, despite a few cringe-worthy lyrics (I love you so/Let's watch the flowers grow). The banjo on ""Sing"" and ""Flowers in the Window"" adds a nice touch. I like every track on this album, but ""Pipe Dreams"" is probably my favorite. It will be interesting to see if Travis decides to change direction with their next album, but for now, I have no complaints, because they are making great music!"
5,The Invisible Band,"Make no bog about it, the boys from Scotland are back in town. {rimshot} Travis 3rd disc, The Invisible Band, follows in much the same vein as their international breakthough The Man Who, though no track on Invisible is as instantly catchy as ""Why Does It Always Rain On Me?"" and ""Driftwood"" were. Nigel Godrich produced this one too. Just wish the boys woulda' toured more off of this disc than their opening/co-headlining spot with Dido in summer 2001, and their club tour with Remy Zero that fall. If you get to see them live, do it. They seem happier than anybody else to be performing and enjoying their own music with Andy's high scissor kicks and Dougie's strutting. ""Flowers In The Window"" is prolly the happiest song Franny has written. ""Safe"" sounds like it coulda came from many a film soundtrack. Fave tracks: ""Flowers In The Window,"" ""The Cage,"" ""Safe."""
4,incredibly melodic,"There's hardly a song on the disc that doesn't stand up on its own as a glowing, shimmering pop song. Travis has a now-obvious talent for constructing songs that get into your head and don't leave. One can see why they're the hottest thing going. This is probably the most instantly accessible CD I've heard in a long time. I'm enjoying it thoroughly.That said, it should be noted that those of you who come expecting Radiohead 2 will be a little put off. That level of complexity and experimentation just isn't there, at least not yet. But Travis is a great pop band in their own right, without need of comparison, and ""Invisible Band"" is a brilliant pop record."
3,Nice...Just nice,"The title sums it up.First of all: I do like this album, and I think ""Side"" is perhaps among their best work so far.But there's one little problem with this album: while there are no bad songs in this record, it's just TOO nice. I feel like it lacks something (a couple of more energetic choruses wouldn't hurt).I mean, it is very unlikely that you'll listen to these songs and go ""OHHHH YEAHHHHHHH!!!"". No. You'll probably think""hum...that's OK"".It's a good, worth buying album, but you may feel a little let down because of the high standarts set by their previous releases ""Good Feeling"" and ""The Man Who"".Anyways, enjoy it."
4,Not just your average English band,"Although this is the first cd I've ever heard of this band, I can say it won't be the last. Travis is a band that at times is very reminiscent of Radiohead and at other times sounds like classic pop that you just don't mind listening to on a regular basis. They may not be as upbeat as some people would like but they are great for that lackadazical day where you just want to have some good music in the background."
2,Take more time after The Man Who,"The Man Who was brilliant. I hate the RadioHead comparisons. Travis would be a fine band without RadioHead ever existing. They were building nicely between the sound of the first and second. Couldn't put down The Man Who last year. However, this new release is brutal. I've given it plenty of time. The lyrics are trite and sometimes [silly]. I think the Partridge Family had deeper lyrics. ""What is sad, glad, mad?"" for example. They should have taken more time, more time, more time to write. Seeing this get a 4 1/2 star average review from listeners makes me wonder. The Man Who is a top 10 release for the last 10 years - they were capable of so much more on this one. They'll be back, I know."
2,A nice album from four nice guys.,"This record is quite [bad]. 'Side' and 'Afterglow' are standout tracks, but most of the record shows little evidence of growth from ""The Man Who"". I've given it 2 stars because I am a Travis fan, but this isn't a record that you'll keep in your CD player unless your collection is already pretty weak."
3,"It's good, not great.","Travis is the archetype of the sensitive and inoffensive rock band. Don't push musical boundaries. Don't frighten or shock or question anything or anymore, lest it might lose you 'listeners'. At least they're honest. Travis write songs that are catchy and safe, tunes that you'll be humming innocently to yourself. 'The Invisible Band' is a step into the mainstream. There are more potential singles in the first half of this disc than their entire last CD 'The Man Who'. These songs are a throwback to another era, where 'pop' was fun and banjos were, ah, cool. Unfortunately, there's nothing here that comes close to the greatness of 'Driftwood' or 'As You Are'. For an album that could only be classified politely as department store music, this isn't half bad."
2,the Invisible BLAND,I'd call it diet Brit pop. Sing is about as mediocre as you can get. It reminds me of Christian music - riskless and predictable. Travis inspire no one on this album and carry hardly any soul from track one to ten. A thorough listening gave me no reason to go back again and offered no remedy for my post-purchase anxiety. Buy John Lennon's Double Fantasy and save yourself before this abuse of schmaltzy melodies invades your consciousness.
4,Sometimes simplicity is a virtue,"Travis' appeal comes from their simplicity. One doesn't need to listen to the album a dozen times for it to work its magic. Travis provides catchy, appealing songs, for the most part.I've found myself misinterpreting the lyrics that made the music sound deeper than it was. I can't understand how a song like ""Flowers in the Window"" can work; in all its pop laced unabashedly joyful way just makes one feel good.In my opinion, Travis' ""Invisible Band"" provides simple, enjoyable music that you won't be embarrassed that you enjoyed it 5 years from now."
2,Oh dear...,"From the minute you hear Sing you know Travis haven't changed a bit. They're perfectly happy to remain the least risk-taking band in the world. I mean Sing is a very nice happy anthem to sing-a-long to but its not exactly the classic of the century. And I wasn't really expecting heavy rock out of The Invisible Band, but they could have done a bit better than this. They now really don't at all deserve the title 'Indie Rock' or 'Alt Rock'. I see the indie, I just about see the alt, but where's the rock guys?It not like The Invisible Band ever claims to be rocky, but with songs like Dear Diary and Safe (which is exactly what the title suggests) appall me. At least a few of the tracks are beautiful, unlike the re-hashed acoustic indie of The Man Who which abides on most of the rest, boring incredible by the end.This is wonderful as a lullaby album, but unfortunately not all of my life involves wanting to be sent to sleep."
3,Oh well,"So Travis has decided that AOR is the way to go. I had hoped, following the Man Who, that Travis would follow-up with something a little rockier (after all, this is the group whose debut single was All I Want to Do is Rock). But no. The songs on TIB are catchy but they're all mid-tempo variations on Driftwood and its ilk. Forget the Radiohead comparisons; Travis isn't even as experimental as Coldplay (another group seemingly content to stick with the winning formula)."
4,Sitting Music,"What an album. I bought the Why Does It Always Rain on Me Single and loved Driftwood, but never got the album. I picked this up on a lark and really love it. It's rare that I like an album on the first listen, but I did this. I had heard Sing on the radio and of course was singing along, but the second song was even better. By the end of the album, I had it on continuous play.This is good music to serve as the background for a good summer. You can listen to it in the car, playing cards, drinking beer, working, laying by the pool or whatever. There are one or two songs that are a little sappy, but the rest of the album is the kind where if somebody hears it, they instantly like it too, no matter what kind of stuff they like. Then you seem that much cooler for having bought it first. Do not pass this record by."
4,"Calming, mellow acoustics","I had only heard of Travis through a Canadian music channel one day, pushing them out of my head the second i saw them. Then, after seeing them over and over while promoting their newest album, i decided to listen in on afew tracks on mtv.com and to my astonishment, i heard something VERY beautiful. It's comparisons to Radiohead are quite accurate and the Scottish singers' voice reminiscense is quite extraordinary. Listening to the simple strummings and the tite drums really keyed me in. It also seemed like most of the tracks could be used to give or possibly sing to one's partner. This album definately lived up to the hype it seemed to portray."
5,An Instant Classic of Ingenious Sobering Sincerity,"Of the hundred albums that I have purchased this year, Travis's ""The Invisible Band"" is by far the best. There seems to be a greater level of comfort on this album among the band to just let it all out and spill their gutts to the world. This album is for the real people out there. It's about the music -- and nothing else."
4,Dismissed for Less,"The most frustrating thing about a band like travis, is that they a more often than not, dismissed for less. Travis and Fran Healey are not the a-typical talented rock band, they are much much more. The songs are timeless, the lyrics witty, and the melodies come-off as the effortless humming of a master songsmith. No, Travis is not the next Beatles (Buy neither was about a million other bands - including Oasis), but their approach certainly holds a rarely understood musical approach that seems to elude the majority of songwriters today.The Invisible Band is a little more light than The Man Who. Somewhat more straight forward and positive. There are several gems here that will haunt you in your sleep. You will wake-up humming these songs."
1,Candidate for Zero Star cateogry,"Each year amazon should have a contest for the worst product that deserves zero stars, and this could be a finalist i'm sure.As the other reviewer reported, the weight just doesn't make the grade for the gauge if it is real copper. Aluminum maybe, but not ""oxygen free copper""Resistance measurements made with an Agilent 4 wire kelvin ohmemeter also show that it doesn't meet the spec for 8 ga wire. I trust Agilent T&M; gear - I don't trust this wire.Don't risk it - Don't buy it - Run - don't walk away."
3,"Worked Well, May not be actual 8 guage, but quality ok",Used this for wiring an amplifier and speakers in my boat. Quality was very good and I would recommend to anyone!
2,Should look more realistic for the price,"For the price I would have thought it was more realistic and bigger. My 7 year old has hardly played with it, since receiving it a week ago."
2,Over-rated,"The premise of the book is quite interesting...a synergistic interaction between Machiavelli and DaVinci. Put simply, the book falls flat. The first half of the book develops the reader's interest by providing details about the war and the 2 principles. One awaits the promised intercourse, only to find that the potentially exciting 'magnificent dream' was a weakly presented proposal and that DaVinci and Machiavelli never had a meaningful interaction. Overrated, period."
3,What could have been if the Arno river was tamed!,"This book has an interesting theme and is an original subject. I am notat all sure what Masters writes is true, since this history is very long ago, and the sources are not there. It seems probable that Machiavelli met and knew DaVinci. It seems clear that DaVinci tried to use the Arno initially to cut off the water for Pisa, and later to improve the commercial position of Florence and the city's boss Borgia. The book does show how DaVinci was ahead of his time in trying to damm and control a river.This book drags at time and has lots of related material thrown in. I did learn a little more about the characters of Borgia, DaVinci, and Machiavelli. An alright read."
3,"Enjoyable, if somewhat unsatisfying","This entertaining and informative book recounts a probable collaboration between da Vinci and Machiavelli on a (failed) plan to divert the course of the Arno River for military and political purposes. Masters provides a wealth of cultural and biographical detail and the book certainly added to my admittedly rather sketchy knowledge of the two principals and of early 16th-century Italy. The reproductions of contemporary maps and drawings were great, but I'd have liked a modern map showing the geography of the region more clearly. The supposed collaboration itself doesn't really seem sufficient to support a book of this length, so description of the project and of the historical evidence for the collaboration are filled out with a good deal of background material and a lot of tangential sections. However, it's all interesting stuff and whetted my appetite for more books about da Vinci, Machiavelli, and Renaissance Florentine culture."
4,very interesting read,"this book has been sitting on my shelf for months until I finally picked it up and started reading. I finished the book rather quickly as the content is very interesting. I found the chapters on Leonardo especially well written. Three quarters of the way through, though, I realized that I had finished the book and the remaining pages were actually notes and credits. It's a good read from start to finish and a good high level view of the topic for anyone interested in this period of Italian history. The notes are lengthy and would lead the reader into further depth if so desired. I found the book to be almost like a fiction in it's presentation and that kept my interest as history books in general do not."
5,Ernesto sirolli,I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks they want to make a diffence in the lives of others. You need to listen listen listen.
5,Wonderful,I work with small businesses and developing entrepreneurs and this book helped me see another view and perspective in the work i go. I recommend it for anyone who works in the small business (and micro business) community and who would like some new direction on how to build local economies.
3,older skin,"If you have very dry skin as I do, this is not moisturizing enough. Not even enought for the day time."
3,Pretty good moisturizer,"This product is very rich and goes on thick so you only need a little to cover a large area. After two months of consistent use, I have not seen any reduction in fine lines, but my skin is soft, so I think it's a good moisturizer.It irritates my eyes if I get too close so I won't repurchase as I hate the feeling."
1,Why?,"My only question is why would you pay $129.99 when you could order all of them separately through Amazon, brand new, for a total of $28.97."
4,tough enough,"these boots come with a removable liner that isnt very durable, but the boots themselves are all the way worth the price and get five stars from me"
1,You get what you pay for,"If you need a measurement, this tool might be good enough. If you need an approximate check for squareness, this tool might be good enough. However, if you demand any kind of accuracy, such as for woodworking, or tool set up, then you need to look beyond this particular item. Durability is also questionable, as the rule will flex or bend easily. About the only thing I have been able to use this square for is marking 2x4's to cut for framing...."
1,It's good for...,"Not much else but taking up space on your peg board or in your tool belt. It's ok to use for framing or other construction projects, as long as you know how to compensate for it's inaccuracies. I paid much more for this than Amazon's price at the orange borg. To me it isn't even worth what Amazon wants for it."
3,It's OK.,This product is ok but there are other brands that are better. I'd rate this middle of the road.
1,Totally unreadable,"Buyer beware! My copy of this book is totally unreadable because the OCR software does not recognize Sanskrit and thus the ""Sanskrit"" parts are like: ""frqqq-/?: qvrrrtt AR//-# sftqv+"". The whole book consists of such meaningless codes and so I have to return it. Since I am not living in the US, the postage I paid is several times higher than the amount Amazon said they will pay me back.Jeff Ho"
5,Great,Great swing works great on the swing set easy setup very good quality would highly recommend this the kids love it. Was a replacement swing on existing set
4,kids swing,"we purchased this single swing for a tree swing... worked ok, but be aware if your purchasing for a swing set, the 's' hook is not includedother than that... it's a great little swingseat is soft and flex-able (no pinching the kids bottoms)the chain is hidden so no pinching fingers eithervery well made"
1,Not for a tree,"Naturally, the outside of the box containing the swing made no mention of the fact that this swing must be suspended from a swing set with bushings. So my purpose of suspending this swing from a horizontal tree limb was defeated. Returned it and sought another."
1,Chain broke after 14 months while in use. Plastic holds water & causes rust.,"I bought these swings to replace a set of swings that I had for over 5 years. They were comfortable enough. However, last week my daughter and her friends were swinging, granted they were a little older weighing about 100lbs and the chain broke in two while the swing was in motion. There was considerable rust under the plastic coating. The swings that I had prior to these did not have a plastic coating and the chains did not rust. I do not think the quality of the chains used in these swings compares to prior models. I also do not think that the pinch free plastic coating is a good design, as it traps water around the chain and causes rust. I did inform Little Tikes of this failure and they were very prompt to investigate. I wonder if there might be a recall? Thankfully, the fall was not serious. The child was ok,but it could have been a disaster!"
3,Little Tikes Mga Cozy Swing,Was looking for a tree swing and this was listed under my search. Ordered it and found out it was not really going to work the way I wanted. It looked sturdy enough for my 5 year old but the attachments for a tree were not there. I then decided to find hammock attachments on line at amazon so I am hope to wrap those around the large branch several times and then use the S hooks to attach it. Did not want to send it back cause the cost would be as much as the price. Will make due my way.
4,"OK swing, No heavy kids","Great swing, although there is probably a weight limit that I forgot to read about somewhere. My neighbors are ten years old and probably weigh almost 100 lbs. They swing a lot and the links keep breaking. We just bought a caribeaner and everytime a link breaks we just attach it to the next one."
5,Super Swing,We bought these to replace the old swings on a used swing set we bought. These are sturdy and NO assembly required! Just take it out of the box and hang. Very happy so far!
4,Almost Gipsy Kings's cousins,"Ciganos d'Ouro are the Portuguese version of the famous Gipsy Kings. Their music has a very nice dancing nouveau flamenco-like beat. If you like the Gipsy Kings, Armik, Ottmar Liebert, or other Spanish guitar artists, you'll enjoy the Ciganos d'Ouro."
2,recommended by Dr,The quality wasn't there and one came with a hole near the ankle. You get what you pay for so not recommended.
1,customer service,"i put my boostmobile account on auto reboost and the very next month i see $100 is put on my cc. i called 7 times to try and straighten this out. the last guy,juan , hung up on me. frustrated, i looked on my cc bill and noticed a 1-800 next to the charge. called it and found out they are not part of boost and they can not remove any charges. two hours later and one month in time i took care of the issue. took my phone off of reboost. let the extra money get applied to my bill the following month and shut the phone down when the time ran out."
5,Tom Thumb,"Loved the film; brought back memories of my childhood when my parents brought me to see it back in the late 50's. The film though presented principally for children, has a lot of sentimentality and morals to its' credit. Really nice movie."
4,Warning - No Commentary,"I loved this film in the cinema, though it may be tooslow and dated for some children now. However I wasvery dissapointed when I bought this DVD to find thatthere was no audio commentary contrary to descriptionhere and other sources. I don't know whether it wasperhaps on some early copies but it isn't on thecurrent version. Seems a missed opportunity if it wasdropped for some reason."
3,"Don't overlook the George Pal animation, George Pal fans","Fans of George Pal need to check out this movie for the animation sequences that bear his mark. They are typically delightful and creative. The rest of the movie is okay, my 9 year old son thought it was pretty good, but not great. But the George Pal sections take it up a notch, and make this a must for fans of this brilliant animator."
4,Great for small kids,"My wife and I thought this was a very odd movie, with almost more of a ""B movie"" quality to it. Great special effects for the time combining live action with go-motion (""Gumby"") style animated characters, fun music, fantastic dancing, but writing was just so-so, even for a kids' movie. For that reason I couldn't give it 5 stars, but my 2-year-old and 5-year-old loved it, couldn't get enough of it, and that's what really counts for me."
1,Not enough helpful info,This is more a history book then a guide for where to go - when to take a guided tour and when you can strike off on your own - waste of money - need practical information - left my copy in the ship library.
5,mediterranean crise,"this book is informative and fun to read. i am taking very few books on my first trip to europe, its a 20 day medtitteranean cruise with 2 extra days in rome to relax and wait for the ship. this is one of 2 books i am taking, its easy to read and the photos are nicely done and it help me decide on what excursions i want to take."
1,Disappointment,"This book was a disappointment. The ""map"" was a poor one, and the book itself added little to my knowledge of the area. Don't waste your money."
3,"Too many pictures, not enough information","I expected more from this book after reading some of the reviews. I do really like the diagrams of the ports and some of the maps seem helpful but other maps are bad with scale and distances just plain wrong. I have also found many spelling errors... who edited this?My biggest complaint though is the pictures outnumber the information. Some pages have 4-5 photos making each one so small you can't see much of interest in them. And the photos aren't that good to begin with, many actually look like scanned postcards.This book seems to be a very unprofessional attempt at a travel log. There are other books on the market which do a much better job... don't buy the book just for the diagrams of the ports!"
3,Lots of pretty pictures,"Naturally, I bought this book because I'm taking a cruise in the Mediterranean, and the title and product description were appealing.The good: there is a nice overview of the major historical influences in the area, as well some art/architecture information that can educate a visitor enough to appreciate many things that will be seen touring the MedThe neutral: probably too much space wasted with ""life aboard a cruise ship""-type information;The bad: there is no shore excursion information in it; I would have found it much more useful if information about reliable local guides/tour companies were provided (or details about how to take local transport, etc., to get to nearby attractions), so that we would not be totally dependent upon the cruise line's shore excursions;Overall: this book is probably only useful for those who are taking a cruise for the first time or visiting Mediterranean countries for the first time; don't expect detailed guidance"
3,OK overall,I bought this book to research stops on our first European trip. I would have liked more detailed information about museums and their hours and costs. Also more info about making any reservations and purchasing tickets ahead of time. Overall it is somewhat helpful in planning what to see and do. The walking maps are very good.
2,Disappointing,"We are about to embark on a Venice to Barcelona cruise and bought this book sight unseen on Amazon, always a bit of a risk. It's 4 star rating and inexpensive price influenced us. Some of our ports were missing or information was too perfunctory. Korcula in Croatia was barely mentioned and Toulon in France was ignored. Probably unreasonably, we expected too much from one book trying to cover all the Mediterranean."
5,Perfect Cruise Ship Guide!,This outstanding cruise guide includes history of region and each port and suggests what highlights to see on a 1-day or longer stop. Also notes the costs and benefits touring on your own or buying tours sold by cruise ships. Perfect guide for planning our Mediterranean cruise! A great value!
4,"Great overall guide, but specifics are lacking.","I am planning my first trip/cruise to Europe and I was hoping for a more in depth look at the museums, restaurants, sights, etc. More than anything it was a history lesson... But, overall it had good information and it a nice ""catch all"" guide."
1,Of little use,"I bought this book because I had bought Vipond's book on Northern Europe by Cruise Ship and found it invaluable. IT covered how to get around on your own and NOT pay for cruise ship excursions. All this book does is tell you what excursions the ships will offer. There is a little history of the ports but it doesn't sound like she has actually been to them. Again, the Northern Europe book was fantastic and saved us a lot of money when taking a cruise. This book provided no help on how to get around on our own. Very disappointed."
4,Very helpful,We are planning a med cruise for our honeymoon and this book is proving to be very useful. The pull out map of the whole area is a nice addition. Would recommend if you are considering a med cruise.
2,Did not meet expectations,"This book provides very little that could not be found in a regular guide book or cruise publication. We were looking for helpful input regarding where the ship would dock or tender at the port, and ways to get to sights from those spots, and ideas on tour guides beyond the cruise offerings. We were disappointed"
1,"required reading, not to read for pleasure","I read this years ago for a class I was taking. It was awful, but required. At the same time I was working the night shift in a psychiatric hospital. The book bears absolutely no resemblence to the real world of mental illness.If you have to read this book for a course, hopefully you will then move on to a more interesting and useful class.If you want realism, try Ken Kesey's ""One flew over the Cookoo's nest"". Everyone I was working with at the state hospital read this book, then the local college produced it. A lot of the patients were taken to see the play and they loved it. (This was before ""patients"" became ""clients""). The movie gave me nightmares; I saw it after I left the hospital and it was too real. The mental health field has of course changed considerably since the 70's and a lot of those people are now out on the streets talking to themselves.Unfortunately Szasz is a classic theorist and this book will still continue to be read."
3,"""The Myth of Mental Illness"" is not Szasz's magnum opus.","Though this book might be of paramount importance for those who desire to find an antithetical position to the ""Doctors for the pathologizing of human behavior,"" I think it a terrible mistake to read this book with the assumption that understanding Szasz will be the result. Written early in his career, this book, like Beethoven's early symphonies, deserves not the attention it receives for the titilating title. I believe the influence of Karl Kraus caused the about face demonstrated by ""The Myth of Psychotherapy"" from the position outlined in ""The Ethics of Psychoanalysis,"" both books he published later. For those that desire to find a summation of Szasz in one volume, I would recommend ""Insanity."""
1,"""Have You Ever Been Experienced""","I read an early edition when I was an undergraduate,studying Psychology and Philosophy manyyears ago. At that time I did not take Shatzseriously, considering it a work in the humanities.I have not changed my mind, but I am surprisedto see this and the Laingian school sustainits influence in medical psychiatry over thebodies and souls of what must be many ill peoplewho have been naive and vulnerable enough to havefallen for this school of thought. There may even be aresurgence of this direction, given thepresent social and economic problemsin health care provision, though unrelated tothe substance of the medical arts.Dr. E. Fuller Torrey has a chapter devoted in hisbook ""The Invisible Plague"" 'Why is the Epidemic Forgotten'--THE MYTH OF MENTAL ILLNESS, where he reviews thelegacy of Foucault, Laing, Shatz, and other anti-scientificwriters on the brain, (p. 302). I could not write a better one."
1,Scientology apologist,"Scientology is a dangerous cult and Szasz is one of its biggest supporters. And some believe you should just change your lifestyle and you can rid yourself of Cancer, too. Most rational scientists and mental health providers know that many different types of therapy--changing personal conduct as well as medicine and therapy--work, oftentimes very well together. Beware ANYONE who says: This is the only way."
1,HuH?,"This amazingly poorly informed man thinks psycotic indivudals who hear voices are engaging in ""lifestyle choices"". Szasz then goes on to inform us because behavior isn't an organ, mental illness isn't an illness. OH, seeing isn't an organ so blindness isn't a disease. I'm certainly glad this man wasn't around when I was a teenager defending my right to comit suicde based on my mood disorder. I can't imagine a more irresponisble book will be written. Thomas szasz is to mental health what duane gish is to biology."
5,Captivating,Albert French captures your feelings with this novel. I read Billy and actually felt like it was a true story. I had to keep reminding my self that it is fiction. Albert French writes with an essence of Toni Morrison.
2,Bad style,"As a grammar-fiend, I must say that this book is really lacking. I realise it was written in the vernacular for a purpose, but really, after only 4 pages I found continuing to read the monstrous grammar painful. This book is practically a guide to how to speak as if one never had any schooling."
4,Great story!,"I read the whole series of the Angelique books years ago. Last year I started reading it again and I have enjoyed it a lot. I particularly enjoyed this book which is 1 out of some 10 books. Angelique finally finds her lost love and husband of 15 years ago that she continued loving and yearning for through all the adventures and challenges she had to go through to survive.I love the whole series, the story is very imaginative, inspirational, has a strong female character, and it has history as part of the story. Wonderful romance and good character development.I understand that there are still 3 books to be translated from French into Spanish. The author is still alive but doing other things, so unless you and I learn French we may not have the opportunity to see what happens and how it ends.So, you are in for a good read if you like the elements I have mentioned. It is a book well written and well translated. Enjoy!"
4,Solidly built,"Solidly built lamp with strong clamp. I'm using this with the philips hue LED bulbs and not as a brooder light. My first attempt tightening the angle adjustment left me with a lamp pointing down after the first night. The adjustment needs a bit more force than I realized initially. The lack of switch on the lamp might be a concern for some, but I prefer it with wireless controlled lights. I would prefer another 2 feet on the cord though."
2,Flimsy and shallow,The reflector is made of very thin aluminum; it dents and loses its shape easily. It is also very shallow. A standard 250 watt heating bulb extend beyond the rim. The titling mechanism is also weak. One has to tighten a tiny wing nut with a great deal of force for the lamp to maintain its position
2,Different from description,"I got the clamp light, but it wasn't as described. The listing say 9' cord - it was 6' cord. The picture shows a white cord - I got it with a black cord.It is ok , it works, but I really needed a longer cord."
5,Comfortable Seat,"I bought this seat to replace the stock comfort bike seat...which wasn't very comfortable for a guy with a big ""A"". This seat is VERY COMFORTABLE, supports well and is made to cruise vs race."
3,Not as comfortable as advertised,"I ordered and received this seat and tried it out and have to say Iam somewhat dissapointed! The seat isnt as comfortable as I'd hoped, but maybe it needs to be broken in more? Once I adjusted the seat (important) and tried it different ways tipped up or downwards it feels different, so try it in different positions as Iam doing now? Its tough to know what is right for you when ordering online, instead of a bike shop letting you try this or that seat to see which one works for you, but that doesnt happen much either as Ive checked and most bike shops wont let you try seats out? Hopefully the seat will loosen up somewhat in time?"
2,Not riding on Cloud-9,"We bought the seat for our Schwinn Air-Dyne, since the original seat had flattened out over many years.This seat was very uncomfortable for my husband. It was too wide in the front. We only used it a couple of times but the company would accept no return if the packaging had been opened. (Huh, how do you know if it is comfortable if you don't try it?)For myself, I did not feel any comfort as the 'gel' was too firm for me.We would not recommend it for those reasons. We took the seat off one of our bicycles and are using that, it is much more comfortable and that bike had sat outside for over a year. Should have done that to start with and saved the money.Hope this helps,"
2,Loved it until it Squeeked,"Loved this seat for four-and-a-half weeks until the springs started squeeking loudly on fourth ride. Tried lots of measures to stop squeek to no avail. This included retightening all bolts, oil, grease, silicone spray, WD-40, etc. Nothing stops the squeek.Unfortunately seat is one week outside Amazon's free return policy. Attempted to contact seller with no response after one week. Amazon appears to use a number of Fulfilment Sellers for this seat so your mileage may vary if you have a problem. My seller, CatchaBuy (Bike Depot Inc) was non-responsive. If you get a seat that doesn't squeek you will love it. If you have a problem you may not get support."
5,The seat saved my bike riding,"My wife complained that every seat we tried for her caused pain and made riding an unpleasant experience for her.I got this seat hoping that maybe it would work.After a half mile, she said everything about the ride was better. After 10 miles she said the only thing that hurt was her wrist. I can't blame the seat for her wrist.This seat looks and seems to be designed like those bicycle seats in the 1960s, complete with two springs under the back part of the seat.Now, I am sure that this seat will not work for everyone, but it is worth a try!"
3,Yikes... not what I expected....,"Hmmm... this is not like what I thought it was going to be like when I got it. The seat is just way too wide and I pedaled like a clown on a tricycle. The seat isn't all that comfortable either... feels like hard rubber. When I would go over bumps there is/was a metal ""clinking"" sound as the seat would compress and and release tension from the lower springs. It looks gigantic on my 2008 Specialized CrossTrail Expert bike as well. I took it off and bought a different Cloud 9 seat that was a little over 7 inches wide and has the spring suspension and gel padding. That seat is MUCH better than this one (browse around and you will find it and also my review on it).It just doesn't fit my build I guess. I am 6'3"" and weigh about 215lbs in case that helps anyone.Also beware of the return policy..."
3,Good saddle but could be better,"This saddle has a great shape and feels fine for a few miles, but it soon becomes apparent that it could use softer padding. Also, the suspension springs are uncoated and squeak and groan as you pedal. I am of average weight so I know I am not overloading it. I removed the springs and reinstalled them using nylon washers under the nuts. This helped some with the noise. I like a good wide seat and this one fills the bill in that regard, but it needs reengineering to be the best."
4,Great seat!!,"I had been looking to replace my bicycle seat for some time now because since I am a big guy, the stock seats that come on the mountain bikes are ridiculously uncomfortable and now that I am getting older, it doesn't seem like I have the padding on my butt that I used to. I received this seat as a Christmas gift and right away installed it on my bike. First time out and after making a few adjustments to the angle and height, this seat is truly wonderful! The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because nothing is perfect in my eyes but this seat is real close. It still has the look of the type of seat you would find on a crossover cruiser without having that super wide look of the beach comber bikes. Great seat!"
5,Very comfy seat!,"By far the best bike I have owned and I have purchase 3-4 in the past. It looks kind of awkward with the 2 large springs, but my rear end definitely can't complain!"
4,Nicely padded and wide. Much better than a regular seat,"Bought this to replace a standard seat. It's much more comfortable, wide and soft but not overly so. Any bike seat invented by man will eventually after a long enough ride start to feel like a hard seat, but this seat delays that inevitable point quite well. I'll get another one when this one wears out."
2,Starts out comfy...,"After a 5& mile community ride, my backside started to ache. Today I ordered the Large wide cloud 9 seat. I plan to either return or sell the seat. The seat might work better for a rider with less backside, but since I am well endowed it is a bit uncomfortable."
3,not a fit,"This seat was described as being a ""universal"", however the pole did not fit over my standard exercise bike pole.Should have played it safe and bought a cover instead(which I did)"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"The bike seat is so comfy I love it, I can ride my bike forever. I got the shipment fast and am satisfied with it all."
4,Good Seat,Much better seat than original schwinn seat..softer and more comfortable although still would like a more padded seat than this one
3,its ok,"I found that this seat was not as comfortable as I though tor hoped it would be. Yeah, seat is wider than most seats, but padding is not that good. Thought of ordering the Gel pad for this, but it costs twice as much as the seat did.Its ok for short rides, but if you are going for a 15 to 20 mile ride, better be ready for the soreness to set in."
5,"Heavy, solid, comfortable seat","I liked this bike seat so much I bought a second one for my bike after getting one for my daughter.Its solid, large, and comfortable. Its actually quite heavy relative to other bike seats I've seen which I like... lots of material in its construction.It has a quality appearance and feel.If you have a bike and a butt, you need one of these."
4,Relief?,Purchase these seats to replace originals on my bike. They are not as comfortable as I has hoped but are more comfortable than the originals. Built well.
5,Couldn't be more pleased!,"I've only had the seat for a few days but let me tell you it is even more comfortable than I could of imagined. I wish I bought this seat years ago. The seat isn't too hard or too soft. I'm a bigger guy at 6 4"" and 240lbs. It may not be perfect for everyone but I can't imagine a better seat. Another reviewer mentioned that it does add some weight to your bike, it does but it's well worth the trade off. Also I had no trouble installing it to my seat post. I do like that it adds some height to the bike so I was able to lower the seat a couple of inches. I was concerned that because of the size of the seat it would rub on my thighs but I'm glad to say it doesn't. I'm going to try and get my wife riding again by purchasing the seat for her. Don't think twice about buying this seat!"
5,extremely comfortable!,"I purchased this to replace the uncomfortable bontrager seat that came with my new Trek Hybrid. It is much more comfortable for the rides I do (95% paved), although I do plan to take it to some local parks to ride some trails and I'm sure it'll be fine. I can't comment on longer rides yet as I haven't ridden more than 10 miles although I do plan on training for an MS150 soon and will hopefully be able to update how it is on longer rides later this Summer."
3,Bike Seat,"While this seat is blissfully comfortable, there is one small problem: it squeaks. Loudly. The springs on mine got rusty, and now it's a bit embarassing to ride it. So, if you get it, be sure to keep it in a place where it won't get wet."
2,Meh ... does anyone actually make a soft seat?,"I don't get what all the glowing reviews are about here. I had a smallish seat on my commuter bike that was hard as a rock on my posterior. I figured a nice BIG cushy gel seat would solve my woes. I ordered this seat, and ... yes, I mounted it correctly and ... yes, I have the height and angle adjusted correctly. It's just as hard as the last rock, just bigger. It may hold more of my posterior, but it sure isn't any softer and for me it's, at best, only marginally more comfortable.If what you are looking for is a soft ride, keep looking.UPDATE: I'm actually downgrading this one more star. I just finished a second thirty minute ride today and it was brutal. I now not only think this seat is NOT more comfortable than my original saddle, it may be worse. What the hell happens when I have to ride two hours? I'm planning to re-install the original saddle and ride it for a day to compare."
4,Comfort,"I wanted to start riding my Schinn, that I bought from WalMart, but the seat was too thin and hurt my butt after a few miles. I ordered this one, and it is almost twice the size, fits well on my bike, and more comfortable."
2,Arrived Torn. Very Thin Fabric,"I wouldn't have known how thin the fabric is had it not arrived from Amazon.com with a fairly large tear on one side. I've learned to look over items carefully when they arrive, even if I've no plans to use/install it for a while."
3,Not much better than airdyne,"I checked all the reviews and it rated high now that I have been using it don't know why,not much better than the original seat that came on the Schwinn Airdyne.Guess it's not for Skinny Rear Ends-it is a tad bit better than the aoriginal seat but that's not saying much.let know if you find a better one....Sunlite Cloud-9 Bicycle Suspension Cruiser Saddle, Cruiser Gel, Tri-color Black"
5,bike seating,"This product went over well with my wife. Well thought-out design works well, especially for men. Many seats for racer are not designed in a way that can be used long term by men without damaging nerves located in the groan area."
5,Comfy seat,this seat is for you if you want something comfy and durable it is made very well and has a very smooth ride exactly what i expected
3,"Better, but not fantastic","I thought this seat would feel like a cloud, so I didn't mind paying a little more for it. However, for a woman I think it might just be too big. It's not bad, I still have it on my bike because my husband stole the seat I ended up really liking."
2,No a cloud !!,"I bought this seat at Amazon week ago ,It looks great and very easy to install but its not as soft as I thought ""Cloud "" , made of hard rubber, bumps on horn and rare of the seat are very uncomfortable constently slides the rider toward the front of the seat.Now I am buying Gel cover for this seat to reduce the discomfort."
2,"Great Seat, Doesn't Fit Schwinn Cruiser 3","This seat looked and felt so comfortable - its probably a great saddle. Unfortunately, it won't fit onto my Schwinn 3-speed Cruiser. The seat post in this (new) cruiser model is a pivotal post with 2 chrome bolts; I thought I would be able to remove the Cloud 9's seat post clamp and mount the seat directly in the post by using the rails. (This is how the factory saddle seat is mounted.) No luck. The seat rails are set about 1/4"" wider than my post will accommodate. No amount of clamping would bend the rails to fit. I guess this speaks to how robust the seat is. In order to use it with my cruiser, however, I'm going to have to purchase a new seat post and standard seat clamp.Definitely make sure to closely examine your seat post & clamp before purchasing."
2,Hard as a rock.,"I guess I shouldn't always trust reviews on Amazon. I have been looking for a comfortable bike seat ever since I bought my new stationary bike 6 months ago with its god awful default seat and it has been such a hassle. This seat is seriously hard as a rock. I can't stand to sit on it on its own. I have to put a pillow on top of it, but even then it still isn't very comfortable. I'm just dealing with this seat (and giving it 2 stars instead of 1) because out of the other 4 seats I tried out it's not AS bad. It's still terrible though."
2,No sliver lining to this cloud.....,"I don't feel this seat is any more comfortable than the stock seat it replaced. Build quality is A-1, but lacks in justifing money spent to replace the original seat. if I didn't have to pay return shipping, I would return it...."
2,big wide seat,"This is a big really wide bike seat. I mean this seat is really w i d e. When you sit on this seat, your legs can only pedal on one side!! If you took this seat on an airliner for some reason, you would have to purchase the aisle and middle seats! Only one person in my entire neighborhood has overwhelmed this seat. She is Bertha winegold known locally as ""big fat enormous behind bertha"" She is only 5 feet two inches but she has to weigh 400 pounds! What she is doing on a bicycle I will never know! Before I could stop her she got on this seat and I promise you, totally obliterated it! It was as if the clouds had suddenly obliterated the sun!!Still if you need a w i d e bike seat, you know, if your tush is so wide it seems to move in a different direction as if unattached to the rest of you, than this is probably your best bet at least until someone puts out a sofa with pedals"
2,"Great seat, if I could only use it","Couldn't wait to get this seat in the mail, as it looked like a great option. Once I received it, I installed it and no matter how hard the nuts were tightened, the seat ""tilted back"" when I sat on it...as in, the angle of the seat went from horizontal to vertical. I now have to take it to a bike shop to get it to work with my bike. I could have returned it, but I plan on sticking with the seat and hope it was worth the effort."
2,This Seat IS NOT COMPATIBLE with the Body Rider Fan Bike.,"Based on the recommendation of Amazon, I bought this seat to ""upgrade"" the basic seat of the Body Rider Fan Bike - stationary exercise bike. This seat is likely great for a traditional bike but it simply is not compatible with this exercise bike. I find it completely irresponsible of Amazon to make a recommendation that consumers buy them together."
3,Amazon recommends this for a Fan Bike. Don't buy it!,"I bought a fan bike off amazon and I read recommendations that the seat is very uncomfortable, and that I should buy a new one.This was in the recommended slot so I bought it.It doesn't fit. It has the absolute wrong kind of attachment for the Fan Bike and there's no way to get it to fit."
4,"Comfortable, however...","This saddle is so much more comfortable than the one that was previously on my bike. Of course, I'm using a vintage bike that had the original saddle, so most anything would have been an improvement. I use my bike for the 1.5 mile commute to work and have to go over a lot of very bumpy, pot hole filled ""roads"" and my previous saddle was causing serious soreness. I don't have that with this saddle. I almost don't even feel the bumps.However- I may be returning it anyway. I'm 5'3"" and have my seat post down as low as it goes. With the previous saddle, I could touch the ground on the balls of my feet- a little bit of a hassle, but not to bad. This saddle sits a lot higher though and I barely reach the ground on my tip-toes. This makes getting on and off and getting going after stopping for a light or traffic very difficult. I'm going to investigate today to see if I can manage to lower it any further, if not this may go back."
5,Great Bicycle Seat,This is a most comfortable bicycle seat for the female rider. I highly recommend it. I also recommend buying it from Amazon as it shipped quickly and safely all the way to me here in Panama.
3,The picture shown is not the same as the seat received.,The seat in the picture is what I wanted. It is made of cloth and leather with sewn seams. The seat I received is the same model number but is made of plastic and what appears to be rubber or rubberized material. The seams are most likely glued. The cushioning appears to be about the same.
2,cancer warning?!,"This saddle was not as soft as I thought it would be but it was still a bit better than the stock seat on my Fuji bike. Definitely harder than expected. The only thing that eats at me is the health warning on the back of the product packaging, stating in tiny print """"WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."" I'm usually not a worry worm but I wish I knew about this warning before buying so I can make a better informed decision since there are so many other saddle choices out there. I'm surprised none of the reviews mentioned this. I guess either the warning is so small that no one noticed, or others have noticed but didn't care."
3,Mixed feelings,"Although this is better and softer than my Schwinn stock seat, it's still pretty hard and makes me feel like I'm sitting on 2 lumps which is pretty annoying. After a bike ride with this seat my butt isn't sore in the usual spots like with my stock seat, but this seat still feels lumpy to me. Maybe I just need to wear it in...hopefully.Edit: It's a bit better but it takes a lot of adjusting. If the seat is tilted even a little bit too high or low, it's uncomfortable or you slide off it. When you get it right it's comfortable. I do indeed like it TONS more than my stock seat, I was just expecting it to be softer."
2,Not as comfortable as the reviews suggest!,"Let's face it, I have a cheap beach cruiser. A Huffy from Walmart. The seat was killing my behind and I ordered this one after reading all the reviews. It came and I had hubby install it right away. Took the bike for a 3 mile ride this morning and am disappointed. First of all, I am not tall. It makes my bike seat too high and it can not be lowered any more. Then the comfort level was not there. I thought a gel seat would be softer. NOT this one! This is also smaller than the standard Huffy beach cruiser seat. My neighbor has a nice beach cruiser with a nice comfy seat and I guess I just need to buy a better bike! Sending this seat back and using the Huffy one till I can afford a new more expensive bike."
2,Frustratingly Ok,"I ordered this product for my bike. I have had so much trouble with getting the screws tight enough to have a long bike ride. The moment I think I'm good, I hit a bump and my seat will tilt up or down. I have tried so much that the bolts look like they have been through a battle. So, still trying to work something out. Comfort wise for the seat itself...it's good. Just the fit is a problem."
4,Good for the price.,"I'm a novice. but one thing for sure..my original bike seat hurt. I tried everything that I could not to break bread to buy a new seat but, alas i purchased this one. I have an affinity for the liquid gel type seats and accidently bought this one thinking it was a ""gel seat"" but it was not. Nontheless it works and is a marked improvement."
3,"Great seat, but the metal is faulty","I could not for the life of me get the seat to stay still, it kept teeter tottering like a see saw, forward and back. I had to finally replace some the parts with the old bicycle seat to get it to stop doing that. After that the seat served its purpose... But It was a pain to have to figure out a solution for it."
4,A bit hefty but does the trick,"It's a bit thick so if your bike is too tall already this will make it impossible to get on, but otherwise it's AMAZING comfort compared to most seats that just come on a bike - very padded. Works for me, which makes me think it would work well for other bony-butted skinny people!"
5,I love it!!,Cloud 9 seats are the best you can get. Kinda wish I got the smooth saddle for my bike but this one did the trick.!!
4,seat cruiser,This bikes seat works great. Easy to install in a couple of minutes. Makes the bike riding much more fun and very comfortable.
4,extensive converage on the subject,"It covers the subject quite extensively. It would be a good reference boook. Moreover, if one wants to know about the recent developments in research on interacting particle systems, then this is the one to look for."
4,One fine album!,"Like the other reviewers, I too grew up listening to my parent's Limeliters collection. Our Men in San Francisco has got to be my all time favorite. One super collection of songs, performed live at San Frans legendary Hungry I nightclub. This will certainly bring back the memories of this highly talented trio, and for those of you who have never heard these guys, I hope this will be the begining of a long love affair with the incomparable Limeliters. So jazzed to see this out on Compact Disk! Enjoy it."
3,Should have read the Discription,I needed these to be able to float upright because we were going to have our own duck race in our neighborhood. I didn't notice that the description says they won't float upright. My Mistake. Otherwise they are fine mini rubber duckies.
3,Dull but cute,"They are supposed to glow in dark. I left them out in ample natural light all day, but when tried to check out how they glow in the night, they just barely glowed. But you could tell they glow. Some of other glow in the dark stars in stuff I had ordered before looked really cool, this did not compare whatsoever!"
3,no glow,"It didn't glow for more than 10 minutes, even after exposed to a lamp for 3 hours. I will not buy againsimply due to the no glow."
1,Xtra small suprise!,I was suprised how small this duck was. Its soo small you can use it as a perfect cupcake topper.
3,Should be called MINI MINI Duckies,"They are cute, but much much smaller than mini duckies, more like mini mini mini duckies.. They are fine, but I was hoping to use them as party favors and they are just too small for that."
1,Dead in the water,"I bought these ""rubber duckies"" for the conventional use of floating them in the water - more accurately a swimming pool during a party. Well, they arrived MUCH smaller than I expected AND float on their sides appearing dead - in the water."
3,It's Okay,"Easy to install. Velcro doesn't stick as well as I had hoped and the remote and phone pockets don't really work all that well for me. Additionally, the thong doesn't cover as much of my crossbar as I had hoped. It does keep sweat from dripping all over the area it does cover. It is worth the price."
2,Too thin...use a towel,"The thong is too thin and doesn't cover the entire top tube of the frame so I use a throw towel anyways. I read reviews about not spending money on a bike thong for an indoor trainer but decided to get one anyways. I could now easily do without one and use a towel instead since I use a towel anyway. The best part about this bike thong is the pocket you can put in front, which can hold my phone, controller, GU's for a long ride, etc."
2,"Catches Sweat, but irritating!!!",Haven't found a good position to install this so it doesn't irritate my hands while working out... it catches about 60% of the sweat and almost all of the drops that would have hit my bike.
2,Not Thrilled...,"After using this product, it seems more of a gimic versus something really necessary. I take care of my ride, so sweat is ""no sweat"" for me.Happy Holidays,Smacka"
2,Just OK - not great,"I was disappointed when I got it because the thong is not wide enough and sweat still falls on the frame, the elastic band that goes around the seatpost is also too long and the thong feels loose.Also, it interferes with my computer mounted on the handlebars!!The part that actually holds the remotes is completely detachable from the thong so I have opted to use that piece only (had to secure it by manually tying velcro straps to bike as they will only stick to the underside of the thong)."
3,sweat protector,"Good quality product, but I can't say it is worth the money. I think it should be a bit less expensive for what it does. A good product overall though. It was nice to see the remote pouch came with it."
2,Stinks for Aerobars,Doesn't work well to wrap around an aerobar setup where my head is farther forward than the actual sweat protector. remote holders are a joke on my setup as well.
1,not for the GMR1038-2,"Do not buy this for the GMR1038-2 or 2CK radios. It is not the right unit for that radio. I have no idea how well it works for the correct radio, but it did seem comfortable and low profile, like it would fit well under hearing protection. woops, duh, darn. I need to return it for either an HS910 or S915, which I don't see on Amazon.I do not think Amazon should take advantage of dopes like me by listing this as ""people who bought X also bought Y"". I now know that is a bunch of bandini."
2,Not compatible,Didn't work with my model walkie-talkie. Be forewarned Uniden it notoriously bad about making accessories that can only be used with certain models. It would be one thing if they were clear about which headsets work with which models. I even talked to Uniden customer service before getting this and they gave me the wrong info.
1,horrible vendor,I contacted the vendor and informed them that the picture and description lead me to mistakenly purchase the item when it would not work for my application. They responded in a rude tone and stated they would give me return instructions and they never did. I sent a second email regarding the return and they conveniently had a return policy they cited which would not allow for the return of my specific item.Horrible vendor worth the money to keep the item and let my kids pretend they work just to never have to deal with them again.
2,This square is not on the level.,"If you plan on doing any serious carpentry, pass on this. The notches are aligned differently on both sides and measurements would only be approximate. At the current Amazon sale price (the second star), it would make a nice gift for your pre-teen child. Otherwise, don't bother."
5,Can't do construction with out it,This is one of the most used tools in my toolbox. If you don't have one get one you will be amazed at all the little places you can use it.
1,Another waste,This book REQUIRES the cassettes which of course the seller didn't have.The book is worthless without them.
3,Essential to Understanding the Causes of the Civil War,"Whether we agree with Jefferson Davis or not, knowledge of his point of view is essential to understanding the causes of the Civil War. The forward by McPherson helps to give balance and explanation."
5,Economical and easily available reprint of a classic,"This is probably the most accessible reprint of Davis' book on the market today. It's well indexed and available at an economical price. My only complaint is that they got James McPherson, a confederacy-hating Marxist, to write the intro."
4,Dropping Foreword Would Move This to 5 Stars,"The foreword in this offering is written by James McPherson, a statist academic studying in politically correct institutions. While his opinion is certainly legitimate, it should not be relied upon to decide whether or not to read President Davis' account of what was happening at the time. No review would be better than one slanted to inculcate the modernist's view from 140 years away."
4,The Virginia Gun Owner's Guide,The book contains alot of useful information and was very helpful as a guide to some of the gun laws in Virginia.
4,Good for the Price,"Well it isn't exactly what is in the picture, but close. It doesn't have a wooden handle. Instead it has a very solid plastic. It isn't the prettiest bevel i have ever seem but it does work just as well. For the money its a buy!!"
2,Huh?,"I'm not really sure what it is authors who write books on Linux are trying to do. When a rookie buys a book on hardware or software, carpentry or gardening they want to know how to do something. Sadly, this book doesn't tell one how to do anything that one does not already know how to do.Starting with installation, the author makes statements like ""for a server installation, you should select server-related components; it is not a good idea to install everything on a server...."" and then he explains why. And then the obvious question is left begging, what are the sever-related components? The book is filled with mysteries like this. The book is, therefore, totally useless for anyone who wants to put up a mail server, or a web server, or a file server, unless you already know how to do it.As for experienced users, I have no idea, I am not experienced. I suppose it might have some use as a reference, but who would know?Save your money...."
3,"good book, but way too many typos","this is my primary reference in getting my server up and running (web/mail/ftp server on an sDSL line), with the Linux Documentation Project my second (linuxdoc.org).This book covers all the services that I would use, but too bad there are *so* many typos littered throughout the book...eg. double dashes when there should only be a single one, commas where there should be a period, etc. etc. For an unexperienced unix/linux user, it would leave him/her stumped since many of the typos are in the example commands or configs or in the step by step instructions!! If I didn't have really good systems admins at work to turn to when I had a question, I'd be lost as well!I'd probably give the book 5 stars if the typos weren't so numerous. It seems like this book was rushed out to print. Shame on everyone involved. If a 2nd edition comes out with corrections, then I'd probably recommend it then."
1,Out of Date,"The book is hopelessly out of date. Although it carries a 2003 publication date, it still refers to the USSR and Czechoslovakia in the present tense. It consistently refers to studies done in the 1980s as recent and less than 25% of the examples, charts. etc. use data from 1990 or later. For example, only 5 out of 37 references in the chapter on Economic Justice are more recent than 1990, and the most recent is 1994. This is typical of just about every chapter. One gets the feeling that the publisher never reviewed this revided edition."
4,Excellent Introduction to EE concepts,"Tietenberg is a big player in evironmental economics, and clearly lays out the fundamentals of environmental and natural resources economics accessible to those without significant economics training."
3,A Recommendation by Margot,"This book is about a mom and dad who are looking for their baby. They found an alligator, seal and a gorilla. The got the baby from the gorilla. I liked this book because it is funny because they keep getting different animals. It is crazy!"
1,need to send right product,"ordered TSP143, the box said TSP143, but the actual machine is TSP100. What is up with that? Now we need to ship it back, and wait forever for correct ones. please get it right"
3,No CD Rom included!,I have not read this book yet. I just got it. It is important to note that this is a reprint and does not include the CDROM of sample programs..
3,Picture is misleading -- it's only 1 drum.,"The drum seems great, but the picture is misleading. I expected 3 drums, but it's only one. Otherwise, it's exactly as described."
2,The Female Elvis? Hardly,"Like a previous reviewer I was expecting this to be like the awesome Wanda Jackson comp, Queen of Rockabilly, but there is absolutely no comparison. Janis Martin has a fine voice, and since this was recorded in Nashville(at the Bradley Barn, I think) the musicianship is competent. What it is lacking is energy and enthusiasm. I don't get the sense that she even liked the material.It feels like she was just trying to make a few bucks off the new trend, as so many did, or being pushed in that direction by her label to move more units. Her biggest hit was My Boy Elvis. Therein lies the problem. She didn't seem to approach rockabilly as anything more than a novelty. She didn't have the fire and raw sexual energy that Wanda Jackson had(but then again, does anybody?). I do suspect that she was a fine country singer in a Patsy Cline mode, so if she did record anything like that I'm sure it's great stuff. This? Not so much."
5,The Female Elvis,"This is fine example of polished rockabilly from the 50's! Janis Martin rocks with Nashville session players like Chet Atkins (on guitar), Floyd Cramer (on Piano), Grady Martin (on guitar), Murray Harman, Jr. (drums), Bob Moore (bass),... Same musicians who were playing for Elvis. Sessions were produced by Steve Sholes, who was Elvis' producer too. Good rockabilly and nice country ballads!"
4,"Janis Martin - smooth voice, great guitar","Well, I just started my Rockabilly collection, and this looked like one to definitely have. I bought this with Wanda Jackson's Queen of Rockabilly CD. I am thoroughly enjoying both. Janis Martin has a very smooth voice, less edgy than Wanda Jackson's. This CD is excellent and provides some great classic Rockabilly guitar sounds, and Janis' voice is just great. I'd definitely recommend this to Rockabilly fans. I personally prefer Wanda Jackson's Rockabilly style (a little more edgy and wild) to Janis Martin's, but both are excellent examples of women who knew how to rock and roll in the 50s/60s."
5,A true rockabilly babe!,"I saw her recently and she has lost nothing as far as her singing and energy level is concerned. This cd gather all her classic recordings from the 50's, and unlike Wanda Jackson(as great as she is), and every other gal rockabilly philly from the era, Janis may be the only gal who didn't have a western accent, or that didn't sound liek a country singer, she sounds more liek a r&b singer(think Ruth Brown), she realyl can bop, and shows how hard she rocks and swings on numbers like Drugstore Rock'n'roll and My Boy Elvis. A great cd that needs to be in every rockabilyl fans cd colelction. ESSENTIAL listening."
5,A collection of great sessions.,"The volume and energy of these recordings cannot compete with witnessing a live Mogwai show, but these recordings are still filled with the same passionate playing that one can expect from them. There are subtle differences within each song that set them apart from their album versions.The tracklisting was very well chosen; the recording quality and production values are outstanding. Standout tracks include ""Hunted by A Freak"", ""Like Herod"", and ""New Paths to Helicon Pt. 1"".All in all, a very good listen."
4,Product review,"In all fairness Mogwai have released some very boring music. The last few records stand out as there most marginal. To get the real deal you have to back to 1999 and the LP Come On Die Young. What Mogwai does best on their early releases is to create mini melodies, stick them in a microwave let you pick up the pieces.""Like Herod"" the highlight on the new CD is the true sound of Classic Mogwai. 7 minutes longer than the version on Young Team the tune starts quiet and peaceful then explodes with power chords, tons of distortion and feedback. Very satisfying.This CD is a great way to introduce yourself to the band or give you a reminder of their amazing ground shaking live sound."
5,"Reminisce the ""Good Ol' Days""","This CD of Ray Noble and His New Mayfair Dance Orchestra is the first in a series of 10 CDs compiling every recording that crooner Al Bowlly made with the Ray Noble Orchestra in the 1930s. On this first CD you will find 24 songs recorded between 1930-1934. Among them is the timeless classic, ""Midnight, the Stars, and You"", recorded February 16, 1934. When you reminisce and think of The Good Ol' Days --- the days of simpler, kinder times --- it is this song that evokes and defines that feeling. This is a must CD for those who enjoy the quiet tranquillity that only the Big Band Music of the 1930s can bring. You will not be disappointed."
5,Midnight by Al Bowlly: is on this CD,"Got this for this one song by Al Bowlly: midnight. It's the song used by John Batchelor for his eponymous radio show originating on WABC, and rebroadcasted to the West coast.Thank you Mr. Batchelor or I'd never have known Al Bowlly's voice."
1,Not received after 5 weeks,I had not received this order after 5 weeks (4 weeks from shipment). Amazon customer service - with its usual insensitivity to the details of particular customer problems - unable to understand that if it is not here in that time then it is unlikely to arrive. Have to wait another month with no commitment they will send it again even if it is not here after that.
3,Love this era of music!,"I love this era of music, but it reminds me of the music used on the soundtrack of the original Stephen King movie adaptation of ""The Shining"" which, unfortunately, was not what I was hoping for!"
5,Trekking the paths of the Conquistadors,This exciting and well illustrated read traces the incredible expeditions of some of the most famous Spainish Conquistadors. Michael Woods travels along the tropical Amazon and to Everglades of Florida in search of the original route of the likes of Cortez and Pizarro. But this is not just an adventure story but also an accurate conveyance of history and the personalities of the time. He also manages to discuss the history on a thematic level - approaching issues such as human rights and colonialism. The illustrations are beautiful and add to the sense of wonder first experienced when viewed for the first time from European eyes.5 stars - thoroughly worth purchasing for any history buff!
5,Conquest of Latin America,"This is an extremely well-written book that gives a cursory history of the Spanish conquest of Latin America. We read of the fall of the Aztecs and the Incas, as well as other trips of discovery undertaken by the Spanish explorers in the early part of the 16th century. The book is too short to give a detailed discussion of each of these events, but it does ""hit the highlights"", as it were. For anyone interested in further reading or study, there are a multitude of works available, but for the casual reader, this is an excellent introduction to what may be considered the beginnings of Europen-style civilization on this continent."
2,This should be called : european bad - ethnic good.,"I give this 2 stars because Michael Wood states his opinion way too much. When I read history I want to read facts and make my own judgment about who was good and who was evil in history. In this book Wood constantly remindes us how bad europeans are and how good the Inacas and Aztecs must have been. This book is more about ethnic worshipping than about history. It still has some facts so that is why it gets 2 stars, otherwise it would be even worst. The author seems to relish every moment a european got killed, but bemoans every inca lose. Not to mention he tries to degrade every achievement the spanish accomplish.If you are a ethic worshipper with low self-esteem that has a reverse persecution problem, then this is for you.On the other hand if you are interested in history and making your own opinion about history, and if you have pride in being european then DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF TRASH.SO STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK."
2,Better than the book Weird History about the Aztecs,"I say this as in the book Weird History it is hardly mentioned at all that the Aztecs were cannibals. Here author Michael Wood frequently deals well with the fact that the indians under Montezuma indeed munched on human flesh regularly. Therefore, he does not make the Aztecs, or their society, desirable in any way. But even so he's far, far too kind all the same as well as sympathetic about these human eaters of human flesh as a judgement of a completely, absolutely negative one is appropriate for the Aztec society. Make no mistake people. The Aztecs were one of the world's three worst societies ever. Right alongside Stalin's USSR and Hitler's Germany.On another point:The bit about talking about how what if the Chinese had discovered the Americas instead is worthless, speculative nonsense and obvious racial butt kissing by the author. Shame on him. You're a white man, Wood, favor your own kind and stop being a dumb PC traitor."
1,Who writes these reviews?,"This production is not even in the same ball park as Loreena McKennitt. Lame production, lame recording, terrible composition, mediocre performances, but other than that it.....well, stinks frankly. I can't think of anything good to say about this pathetic immitation of a wonderful genre of music. I bought it based on favorable reviews. People who like this stuff should not be trying to influence others, rather go back to their Yanni and pretend to be enlightened while they sip weak green tea and burn toxic cheap incense and candles from Pier One."
4,Rani,"Any movie in which Rani has a title role is worth watching; if for nothing more than her voice. She has a way of eliciting both sympathy and empathy at the same time. You want nothing more than for her to be happy. She does not have the ability to act badly, so that is not an issue. The issue is- does she end up happy?! She did... and so did I."
2,Tri Color Corgi Ornament,I was disappointed since I thought I had ordered the tri colored Corgi dog ornament and ended up with only two colors which was not what I wanted.
5,CLASSIC.,"A great movie, a classic movie. Al Pacino at his finest. Sometimes stories do not get any better then real life. Attica. Attica. Attica. Lol."
4,Great movie...,"Not a typical bank robber movie...a truth is stranger than fiction kinda thing. Excellent movie,Al Pichino is great in this and its directed very well by Sidney Lument. I'm fairly critical of older movies due to over acting,but this movie gets a A in my book. Great film."
5,DDA did not win any Oscars...,Dog Day Afternoon did not win any Oscars because One Flew took all!(Just mentioning this to underline the greatness of this movie too)
4,Great movie,"This movie was superb. It is about two men who rob a bank, but dont get out in time and the police come. Basicly the whole movie is the hostage takers negotiating with the police and planning their escape. Al Pacino looks very young in this, but still sounds the same. I would recomend this to people who liked the Negotiator and people who like Al Pacino."
4,Great crime drama.,A very belivable and realistic story. Anyone who enjoys crime movies will enjoy this 70's classic flim. Lots of interesting facts about how to rob a bank and how not to. One of Al Pacino's greatest roles.
5,One of best films of all time.,"Many say its a terrible movie without a point. I say its the best picture of 1975. Al pacino gives his greatest performance ever. On a hot Brooklyn afternoon, two optimistic losers(Al Pacino and John Cazale)set out to rob a bank. Sonny(Pacino)is the mastermind, Sal(Cazale)is the follower, and disaster is the result. Because the cops, crowds and even the pizza man have arrived, the wellplanned heist is now a circus. The film stole 6 academy award nominations including best picture, director, and actor.. Its a shame the academy failed to even notice the performance that was given by Charles Durning. He gave the best supporting role of 1975. The street scenes are brilliant. The cinematography is riveting. The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live TV. 12 hours later, it was all history. And its all true."
3,Classic Film--Lousy Transfer,"As usual, another major studio has done a lazy job of transferring to dvd with ""less-than-optimum"" elements. Warner is known for bad transfers, a problem which they also had when they were in the laserdisc (another ""hi-end"" format) business. I am amazed they didn't even bother to include the ""making of"" which is included on the VHS TAPE--FOR GOSH SAKES, GET WITH THE PROGRAM!"
2,A Different Point of View,"Whereas I do admire Al Pacino's acting ability in A Dog Day Afternoon, the story just seems to drag on for too long for me to really like it. Too many odd ball incidents with the gun play and the burning of the bait money. Its almost a comedy of errors that made this incident just snowball to the point where a Brooklyn street corner became a media circus.Whereas I admire the loyalty of some of the bank employees, I just feel this unfortunate incident did not need to be dramatized into a movie. Also, the pacing of the movie is too sluggish for my tastes. However, I can see the depth of the characters in several of the scenes, therefore I'll instruct you to the make the choice between depth and the overall good taste of the film."
5,An incredible movie,"Al Pacino is just outstanding in Dog Day Afternoon. He expresses so many different emotions in this movie, which allows us to see how talented he really is. It is almost scary how heated he gets in some of the scenes with the police. There are great actors cast, along with an excellent screenplay. I enjoyed this movie very much and would recommend it to anyone. If you are an Al Pacino fan like myself, you must see this movie."
3,+1/2,"""Dog Day Afternoon"" is the true story of Sonny and Sal, two first-time bank robbers whose failed hold-up suddenly becomes a massive media event and hostage situation. These men, both veterans of the Vietnam War and open homosexuals (though not extrafilially involved), must face a war zone of life-threatening obstacles in their spontaneous decision to flee the country. Fantastic, yes, but excellent acting by Al Pacino, Charles Durning, and James Broderick makes this narrative startlingly real. Accessible to the average viewer, ""Dog Day Afternoon"" will find particular interest to ex-convicts, bank tellers, and all seeking a military burial."
4,Truth IS stranger than fiction,"Al Pacino plays Sonny, a man who needs money and decides to rob a bank. Not being experienced at this, he fails to make much of a plan and he seems to make things up as he goes along. Soon everything goes wrong and he is suddenly surrounded by legions of police and F.B.I. agents. His partner Sal is not too bright and as Sonny says, ""I have to make all the decisions around here"". He shows amazing kindness to his hostages while he tries to devise a plan for his escape. He appears in front of the crowd outside while negotiating with the police and suddenly becomes a cult hero when he evokes the Attica situation by chanting ""Attica"" over and over. The mood of the movie seems to constantly shift from humor to pathos to tension and some of the plot shifts are entirely too strange to come from a fiction writer's pen. The acting is excellent and riveting in this movie, based on a true incident."
4,Great!,"Great movie! Much better quality over the dvd. Not as good as some other movies, but the movie is not a new title."
4,What a great remake this movie would be,"I was a running in diapers when this awesome movie played on ""The Movie Channel"". My older brothers were cheering with the crowd when I stopped running and made them laugh by cheering with the tv screen too!( as they tell me)Anywho....I searched AMAZAON and discovered this title and had to get it to recall what the excitement was about.I watched this movie with a friend my age who was very sheltered growing up and he was blown away by the realistic pace of the movie.The cool New York street scenes and the incredilbly superb acting of Pacino and Sarandon.This transfer is clean and fun to watch especially if you like true crime stories."
5,review,This album just blew me away! I enjoy listening to the second track. It's hard rock and ballad like. Its a very nice album.
5,Home Style ATABLE 25-Inch Adjustable Bar Table,"I absolutely love the table. I put together a game room and was running short on money so I took a chance on this table because it was so inexpensive. It arrived quickly and was a piece of cake to assemble. Its sturdy, which is what I was worried the most about. If you need a small pub table, I would highly recommend this table."
4,"easy assembly, great for small spaces",i just moved into a studio apartment and got this table with the mathing chairs. assembly took about 5 minutes. you only have to screw in four screws. big enough for a dinner for two. but still compact enough to not take up space
2,"Piece of junk, look elsewhere for a table","This table is poorly designed, the top pulled off of the base, the four screws holding the top to the base simply pulled out of the particle board, when I contacted the manufacturer, they simply told me I was out of luck and apologized for the inconvenience of paying $70 for a chrome base and black vinyl covered manhole cover.And Honestly when the table was in one piece it still sucked, it would not keep the height I wanted, always creeping up, and the table top spins like a lazy Susan, very annoying."
3,I can't rete this item,I can't rate this item because I thought this was car I didn't know that it was a DVD so I send it back but the seller was very good in refunding me my money.
5,Lowepro is a go!,"I absolutely love the durability and practicality of this bag. There are pockets right where you need them and seemingly more than enough, but I haven't purchased any accessories for my camera yet. The flap on the front seemed sort of useless or overkill until I realized it was helpful when storing my camera in the bag while waiting to take a shot. That way you don't have to use the zipper all the time. The cover that wraps up the whole thing for bad weather is a plus of course. It's super convenient and very reliable!"
5,Small and compact.,"I'm still in awe of this bag. I'm able to get a digital SLR with lens, a second lens, flash, extra batteries and extra Flash cards all within such a small little pack.This bag WILL NOT have enough room for larger telephoto lenses though -- it's barely big enough to carry my Sigma wide angle lens without making me feel a bit ""omigod I'm going to break it"" uncomfortable.There's also a nifty waterproof cover that is permanently attached to the front bottom pocket that let's you quickly flip out and cover the bag in cases of spontaneous rain storms.One caveat on the construction: The connection point between the strap and the bag is incredible flimsy and very easily separates. To remedy this situation, I just replaced that clip with a more permanent one (in my case a metal key ring). This is the only problem that I see and I've been carrying this bag around daily for over a year."
4,REVIEW,"BAG IS WELL-MADE AND COMFORTABLE. PROBLEM IS, IT'S JUST A LITTLE SMALL IF YOU OWN SEVERAL LENSES, SO YOU CAN'Y CARRY MORE THAN 1 OR 2 EXTRA LENSES, AND THEN NO ROOM FOR ACCESSORY FLASH. LOTS OF POCKETS."
5,Solar,"I had my doubts when I ordered this small solar panel, but for the price, I thought I'd give it a try. The panel really surprised me, as I set it up and stuck an OHM meter to it and it was putting out 23 volts DC. Charged up a lawnmower battery and was great at charging my cell and other small items. Good deal here."
3,Wish it was as quality as previous editions,"Working in the field of commercial/corporate interior design, I always look forward to the new editions of this book. I have Editions 4, 5 and now 6. Not that many books are written or photographed with the intent of showcasing corporate interiors and unfortunately No. 6's photographic quality was mediocre at best. I don't understand why a ""photo"" book would not require the entries to be top photo quality? I will not purchase #7 without flipping through it first."
1,Unreadable...,"I read 50 pages of this is was so unmoved I tossed it on the stack, never to be read again."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a M. Night Shyamalan type of Sixth Sense tale, but instead I received a tale that never fully developed. While I like stories that don't 'follow the rules' this book spent time traveling from genre to genre without giving the reader a reason to continue along without a guide.Go to the library for this one, it's not a Keeper."
2,Not Very Good,"This was one of those books that I had been intrigued by since it came out. I liked the idea of a good gothic novel, similar to the 13th Tale, instead I felt empty and cheated when I finished this book. The Keep, by Jennifer Egan, is not a very good book. There were so many different characters and plots going on; however, none of them were that good. I do not think there was one sympathetic character in this novel. There certainly was not one character that I cared about. There was one clever plot twist that turned this into a Two star book for me, rather than a One star novel. I would not recommend this book.I really am not even sure why the term gothic has been used to describe this book. Much less as a Tag. The only thing gothic about the book is that there is a castle. Heck, you can get that from a variety of novel. This is the worse book I have read sinceHawkes Harborby S.E. Hinton."
1,Hard to Follow,I purchased this book after reading a positive review in a magazine. It was hard to follow from the beginning and I never understood the point of the story. I kept reading to give the book a chance and I thought it would get better and it never did for me.
3,Light Reading,"This book promised a 7-course ""dinner"" but only delivered a plate of pasta, so to speak. I never feel as if I got to the steak, or heart, of the story. It seemed that she was always dancing around it with suggestion and then switching over to the other story. I felt as if I was getting the diet version, and that the book good have been twice as long, with many more details and depth of history, etc. It seemed that we got certain character traits over and over rather than explore new ground.Too much of the story was described from within the characters' heads rather than from their actions. I wanted more!"
4,Engaging and unpredictable,This book starts out with hints of a gothic novel and then becomes incredibly complex and engaging. Highly recommended.
2,The Keep by Jennifer Egan,"This book was not to my liking. It didn't tie up the story well enough. A great idea, but needed more work. Sorry."
2,another plegarized book,"Just this. Paul F Wilson. the original Keep writer. Of which they made a movie.Is this the same castle, country, evil which resides that Wilson developed?Did you even ask if you could build on his idea?"
4,"Sparkling, ironic, smart... and wise","I haven't yet finished the book, but I feel that we are before one of the would-be-great of the next generation of American writers. I'm going to buy also her first book. A may-be fan."
4,Absolutely Engaging,I was very impressed with Ms Egan's writing. This was my first book by this author and it won't be my last.I feel this story left a lot to my imagination-and I liked that.As I read each page I could picture the characters forming and taking shape in my mind. I don't get this with every book.I was completely taken in with this story and would recommend it.
2,Won't be keeping this one,"I read an article about this writer a few months back---really expecting good things from this book. In fact, there seems to have been a lot of publicity from the lit. critics touting this one and I truly fell for it. I had this title on my list and finally got around to reading it.Firstly, the writing itself comes off as amateurish. No wonder people are saying it doesn't merit Fiction 101 or even high school creative writing class stature. That was the first shock.Secondly, the story itself is so implausible, and the premise never delivers, making your schlock gothic pulp read seem quite good compared to this. So sorry I believed the critics on this one. Which leads me to another thing--Egan must have some pretty impressive connections! How else can anyone explain the praise this so-so novel has received?So much better to be had."
2,"Almost Put It Down, Wish I Had","I bought this book on the basis of a glowing review on the front page of the NYTBR. It was tedious to the extreme. An interview with Ms. Egan that I read somewhere says that ""I start with very little."" How true, and she does not seem to know where she is headed with her ""little."" I know how hard writers work on books, so I'm reluctant to smear this one, except that she did not work hard enough on this one. It also made me dubious about the quality of the NYTBR, for which I, sad to say, have written. The whole concept was ill-advised, the narrative structure horrendous, the characters underdeveloped."
3,Missing pages,This book was a great read until I hit page 250 and...no more pages. The last pages of my book are missing. I had to go to the bookstore to read the rest of it. Oh well...
1,The style is just too difficult,"The style of narration, ieHoward: Oh, man, look at you !Danny: Look at you!Howard: I don't know if I would have recognised you....is too annoying to read more than 40 or so pages.I can't tell you about the plot, the characters or anything else you might like to know, because the style bugged me too much to carry on."
2,Barely 2 stars,"I read a lot of books, in almost every genre, but this book is one I wish I had not wasted any time on. I am shocked by the 5 star reviews. I do not wish to tell you the whole plot, as other reviewers do, but to give an opinion. There was one surprise/shock/twist in the story that allowed me to give it 2 stars, but beyond that, it is a mystery to me why the book was even written. It is so disjointed. None of the characters are even remotely likeable. The ending is pointless in every way. If you are really looking to read a good book, save yourself the time because this is not it."
2,So disappointing..,"The Keep was a book I wanted desperately to love. I was terribly disappointed by it. I felt the writing was disjointed, and while I understand the author was telling multiple stories all at once, the jarring move from protagonists and writing 'style', left me feeling off balance.This jarring sensation kept me from really enjoying the story. Just as I was beginning to identify with character, the prose changed, and I was left to wonder if what I'd just read really happened...or if it was a fantasy of the prisoner's mind.I tend to enjoy books that are similar to this, in theme and tone, but this one just left me 'wanting'. I wish I had enjoyed it more."
2,Where the heck did that ending come from?,"This book has a promising start, a cop-out ending, and some tantalizing potential in between. It wasn't scary or creepy, despite promos to the contrary. It COULD have been creepy but it was superficial and the pace was rushed so it never got deep or dark enough to be scary. The technique the author used to run two narratives alternated between flowing beautifully and jerking painfully and transparently. I felt so manipulated by the ending! It was frustrating to get engaged in the parallel narrators only to have them fizzle out and get replaced by a character who is hastily developed in the last pages. Lots of lofty advance praise has been aired for this book and this has left me scratching my head. It's a disappointing book from a talented writer."
3,A little flat,"This book wasn't one of the best I've read nor one of the worst, so I gave it three stars because it's just ok. I didn't really develop a feeling for any of the characters. I acutally found them kind of annoying in a way, and maybe it's due to them not being fully developed in my opinion. I also got the impression this was more along the lines of a gothic ghost story and it really isn't it. I think this could have been a much better book than it is and I have to admit to being dissapointed as the plot was pretty flat. As I stated it isn't a bad book, it just wasn't what I had expected it to be."
2,did I miss something?,"Wow, lots of raves for this novel which I found extremely disappointing. The author obviously has talent but I thought her intent was confused. I get that she was making a parallel between the prison and the castle but the plotting and action at the castle felt arbitrary and, in the end, sort of superfulous. Really, what did setting the action in this remote castle bring to the novel? A little atmosphere but hardly any suspense -- the one creepy and potentially suspenseful sequence (everyone getting trapped in the tunnels) is resovled in a matter of pages. I didn't believe the castle setting for a moment or the Baroness character. In fact, I assumed it was all part of Danny's paranoia/craziness but then the ending belied that. I was so hoping for a good, creepy summer read. After this and ""The Ruins,"" I give up."
4,I Wanted it to Be Longer,"I wanted it to be longer because there were some intriguing plot threads that were dropped and never picked back up (the drowned twins, the Baroness, what they found in the dungeon, etc.) But other than that minor disappointment I enjoyed the novel and especially admired the unique narrative style."
1,What a TURD!,"This book sucked on so many levels. Total and complete disappointment. I would turn around and sell it on Marketplace, but the pages fell out........that should have been a sign.....Yuck."
2,"Lots of set up, no pay off","Or rather, one pay off. But after a couple hundred set ups (ghost twins, halucinatory sex, some underlying importance to the place that no one ever names, Howie's physical changes, on and on and on and on....)I was hoping for one or two clever answers.I bought this one after having read a well crafted and creepy tale (The Harrowing by A Sokoloff, Balantine Books) and was in the mood for more.Unfortunately, the cover was the only lasting gothic thing in the book. I gave it two stars primarily because the set-ups were somewhat promising. Just don't read past them expecting any resolution.Total waste of my time, and precious paper."
1,Amateurish and disjointed,"The tightest writing is the two-word title, which got me to buy the book. From there it's downhill. Egan's incredibly sloppy prose nearly insults the reader. The story-within-a-story-within-a story feels like a cop-out. It's not quite ""and then he woke up"" -- but almost. Despite the intricate plot mechanications, nothing much happens. That's partly because her main characters are drugged or being operated on so much of the time. Such cheesey devices echo the worst of episodic television. How this book got an agent and got published is anybody's guess."
1,Who cares?,When I started this book I thought it had great potential but not too far into it I just lost interest and did not care about the characters. The only reason I finished it was I kept hoping for some great 'thing' to happen to pick the story up but it just never came to light. Near the end an additional character comes into play but by then who cares? You can't develop a character in 25 pages and make us care about the person. Terrible book and terrible ending.
2,Not worth the time,"Can't believe I wasted my time on this one. I really wanted to like this book...and I even tried to like it. The first part of the book was good, but then it fell apart toward the middle and it was a chore to keep on reading it as it became just so plodding with nothing happening except for the ramblings of the unlikeable main character, Danny. The ending picked up a bit, but had a disappointing conclusion. On the whole, it was mildly interesting, but did not really come together for me. I would not recommend this book."
2,Great potential wasted,"I agree wholeheartedly with those reviewers who said that this book had a great concept that was poorly executed and not developed. I had high hopes for this book, but as I read, I kept waiting for the author to connect the separate plotlines and characters. Although a connection was made toward the end, it felt contrived. The book does not tie up loose ends, but kind of trails off; there is no real ""ending."" If you're looking for a great book with an unpredictable twist, I highly recommend ""The Thirteenth Tale,"" ""Fingersmith,"" or ""The Stolen Child"" instead."
2,"Oh dear, such a disappointment!","I was so disappointed in this book. A Visit From The Goon Squad was top of my favorites list for last year. This book held my attention up until the last part. I found the writing teacher to be an unnecessary and frustrating character. She chose the murderer over the crack addict? I'm confused, which one is better? Perhaps this would be a book for book discussion, because I don't understand why Egan made the teacher a major player. She added nothing, but a ruinous ending to the book."
2,interesting...but just barely,"There never seems to be a reason for anything that happens in the story, and none of the characters inspire anything but contempt or apathy."
1,Life is too short,"I can't imagine how this book got published. The Keep is on the level of people who write stories ending in ""it was all a dream."" I kept trying to make sense out of it and failing. Also, the characters are indistinguishable or pale away to nonbeing. I am now annoyed with myself for having given any time to trying to make sense of it. Read William Gibson if you want something like this that is also clever and somehow says something about our world."
3,The Keep,"I was not real happy with this book. The story-line was ok. I did not like how the author handles conversations between the characters. It was hard to tell when a conversation was happening, or if it was thoughts or descriptions. I thought it was a disappointment. The ending could have been better."
3,Good,"I read ""The Keep"" after reading Egan's ""Visit from the Goon Squad"" which I enjoyed a lot. ""The Keep"" starts out very interesting, with good characters and fun locales. It kept into reality enough for me until probably half to two-thirds through and then it was just too much fantasy. It started to feel like an academic exercise or someone cobbling short stories together.I recently finished reading a similar (sort of goth and modern) book , ""Sweet and Vicious"" by David Schickler, and I think he did a better job of paring it down and having enough reality and momentum to keep my interest. Egan is a terrific writer and ""The Keep"" has a lot of interesting elements, but it's just a bit too much of a stretch for me. She really is great at writing about American dudes and their dramas and emotions. There were also fun links to modern culture and being electronically connected. The ending was good for me, but by then I was just trying to get through it."
2,Disappointed.,"The story started out great and I was really excited to get into it, but then the story kept changing focus and characters, it was almost like the author was trying to put 3 stories into one novel. Too bad, the original concept was a good one."
4,Hard to put down,"This novel by Jennifer Egan was a good read--stayed up to finish it. A strange, gothic sort of story. You keep thinking you know how things are going to go, but you don't. At the beginning I expected it to be just creepy, but finally it was almost anti-creepy.Look forward to reading more of Egan's stuff."
2,Just plain disappointed,"Really really loved Look at Me but this just doesn't cut it. I didn't care for the characters, and found the layered storytelling frustrating. The castle passages just felt trite and the relationship between the two cousins is not fleshed out. I wish she had just stayed in the castle, with a little backstory and some more original detail. Sorry, I really wanted to like it."
2,The keep,The writing is good but I did not like the story. Too much psycho babble and unbeliebable story line.
3,Engaging read with disappointing finish,"The Keep is a really solid read - entertaining, suspenseful, eerie and engaging - but the narrative felt cumbersome at times and the ending was a bit of a letdown. I found some of the reviews too harsh, but I do agree that the individual parts were ultimately greater than the sum."
1,This was SUCH a disappointing book.,"As other reviews have said, this book had many interesting aspects to work with: the baroness, dead twins, the history of the castle and surrounding towns, the fractured relationship of the two cousins, a cellmate who listens to the dead. It all ends up being completely dropped for...the uninteresting story of a secondary character in a secondary tale. The author's other books are apparently popular, but I'm not sure I'll give them a chance after the disappointment of this one."
5,A book that deserves much more publicity,"I found this book in a thrift store. Having always loved stories about old castles and keeps, I was immediately drawn to it, and it was well worth every penny. It is really two stories, seemingly unconnected. One is a gritty tale of prisoners taking a writing class. The other is a peculiar tale of two cousins who reunite years after a castrophic incident, in an crumbling castle compound. The author keeps the reader guessing whether the story of the castle is true or only the imagination of the prisoner writing the story; and if it's true, which character portrays the prisoner.It is a fascinating and unique story, well-written, and full of wonderful descriptions of both setting and characters. I look forward to reading more of Jennifer Egan's work."
3,The Keep is Not a Keeper,"I was very disappointed in this book. I too felt that it started off well and had promise as it navigated through various characters but there just wasn't enough. I wanted to know more about the characters (Howard, how did he change so much...). We find out that the castle really exists but who is the guy running it and how is he related to Dobbs' story. Where did Dobbs escape to??? What's the relationship with the town? There's too much left out."
3,"For the money, it's not bad.","I bought this plunger to clean out a stubborn sink drain. It's worked reasonably well. Nothing special, but it has gotten the job done several times. The only issue I have found is something that is probably common to any rubber product as it gets wet - the base starts to warp eventually and then doesn't make a very good seal. But for 12 bucks or so, it's not worth worrying too much about."
1,Completely useless,"This thing builds up VERY LITTLE air pressure, and what air pressure it builds up requires you to pump it down VERY fast. It does not build as you push down slowly, in fact it does nearly nothing if you push it down slowly. It barely makes good contact with the sink I'm trying to push a clog through, and if you're not careful and you pull it back up TRYING to make it work it squirts water all of you and random stuff from the top of the shaft. Complete crap."
1,ZERO stars,This is the worst product I've bought in my memory. It doesn't even work as well as a regular plunger. I feel scammed.
2,Maybe on some drains,"Just bought this today at Lowe's. Plugged up our new toilet yesterday with too much paper, and tried our old-fashioned plunger and some tricks I saw on the web (e.g., dishwashing soap and hot water). Nothing worked. I figured I needed a plunger with a larger diameter (for our new low-flow toilet with the odd-shaped outlet hole). This device looked impressive, and the rubber piece seemed to be wide enough. It wasn't, though, and I couldn't get a good seal, so I just ended up squirting a pathetic amount of water around the bowl. Fortunately, while I was at Lowe's, I also picked up a toilet auger...just in case. After the Plung-It failed, I resigned myself to learning how to wrestle with the auger. Much to my surprise, the auger had the toilet cleared in about 5 minutes. The Plung-It may be fine for tub and sink drains, so I'll keep it. It just doesn't work on at least one new-model toilet."
5,Better Than An Ordinary Plunger,"I recently bought this item as a last resort for my shower drain. It's been gradually getting slower and slower, even at times totally plugging up. I've tried every drain opener (and natural enzyme) product on the market, and also used a regular plunger, to little effect. Very annoying taking a shower while standing in water up to the ankles. This plunger, however, succeeds where nothing else has for me. When I get in the shower and turn on the water, I operate the plunger a few times, then stand back to watch the water begin to drain freely -- no more standing in water while showering! Just press the plunger down firmly over the drain to form a seal (using one of the two provided heads), then pump the handle up and down like a bicycle tire pump. This forces air (and hot water) down into the pipe, driving out clogging material. So simple, but it really works for me!"
1,worse than a regular plunger,"To my surprise this thing was messier and less effective than just a regular plunger. The included rubber base is too wide to form a good seal, and there is an air hole near the handle that sprays out nasty toilet air and water directly into your face/hands. The force generated by the air pump is also kind of unremarkable. I'm taking it back."
4,This is a fun book!,"It isn't like any of the other Brace novels. The setting is familiar to Brace readers; an island, sailboats, and the sea but that is where the familiarity ends. Critics had problems with this work in it's day feeling that Brace couldn't make up his mind just what type of a book he was attempting to write. It does take a while to figure out what is going on and I admit there is a spot or two in the book that are stretchs for want of a better word but just relax and have fun and I think you'll end up enjoying it very much as I did. It's just a good, fun book!"
3,"Cadillac Advnenture AV-8 Comfort Bike 16"" frame","It is advertised as a comfort bike but isn't anymore comfortable than a regular bike. I like the disc brakes so far but have only had it since last of July. Would like a wider range of adjustments for the handle bars, up and down and forward and back."
5,Love my bike,I love this bike and what a great value. It is comfortable to ride on which was really important...you could get the right size and the Cadillac people where really helpful to put it together when I didn't want to make a mistake installing the front tire. Their website was also helpful....it had a video to explain how to assemble their bikes. I put the bike together myself and it hasn't fallen apart yet (lol). Found out the bike was originally made to be sold in specialty bike stores but their marketing campaign changed and they found the internet was more successful. Again superb quality for a bargain price. Amazon and Cadillac Bicycles made it possible for me to have a quality bike for a price that I could afford with low shipping costs and no sales tax. Thank you both.
1,Lousy customer service,"What's with the missing parts that I and other reviewers have experienced? What's going on in their packing and shipping section? I'm afraid I didn't get the royal treatment that another reviewer got, whereby they shipped his missing parts overnight. It's been nearly three weeks since I first called, and I can't ride my bike properly because of a missing front break cable. They replied to one of my emails after I called, but usually they don't bother to reply at all."
2,Missing parts,"Lets see No instructions ,no pedals,and no front brake cable. I called the number on the bike and they helped pretty fast. I got everything except the instructions. After getting it put together, I will say it's a nice bike.It's the most comfortable bike that I've ridin. They just need to package it better. Here's the customer service # 866-462-4535 in case anybody needs it."
1,Chewy nuts,nuts and mix was not normal texture. Everything was soft and chewySunflower seeds and almonds and all nuts should not be this way.
1,Do you like pumpkin or sunflower seeds??,"I don't understand why this product is called Apricot Cranberry Mix. This product should have been called pumpkin & sunflower seed mix. In this mixture you will receive a half of handful of nuts ( almonds and cashews ), a pinch of dried cranberrys, and maybe about 3 to 4 dried apricots. 3/4's of this container will contain pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds. Now, don't get me wrong, I like pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds. However, if I buy a product labeled Apricot Cranberry mix, I expect to get some apricots and cranberrys in the product. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. I'm sure not ever going to buy it again."
2,Sunflower & Pumpkin Mix,The picture is very misleading there are just a few apricots. Although this was okay be forewarned the nuts are not very crunchy and there are very few apricots (maybe 4 in the first package). Not worth the money.
4,"Ben Hogan, An American Life","Best full biography on Hogan to date and, with the passage of time, not likely to ever be surpassed. Detailed descriptions of of Hogan's remarkable climb to greatness, his 4 US Open wins and his 3 losses finishing in second place. Well written and enjoyable to read about this great golfer and fine and gentle man."
2,Not A Very Good Remake,"I was very skeptical about this movie to begin with, not because of the cast. The casting was perhaps the only good thing. It seems like these highly talented actors were misplaced in the wrong movie. And they didn't seem to be having fun in it either. The Honeymoners is an ancient show to begin with. A remake given it's proper due of this series is pretty difficult material to tackle. To make it funny for today's audiences seems next to impossible regardless of what ethnic group or race the actors are. It's just not as funny as it once was. It would be the same as some director doing a Three Stooges remake. Some things just shouldn't be done over or dug up again. In regards to this film. It would've helped if it was funny. The audiences of today have high expectations often to a fault. I tried to like this movie though and Cedric the Entertainer is very talented and funny when he is given decent material to work with. This unfortunately wasn't it."
1,ANTOINETTE NEEDS A CRACK REFILL!!!!!!PRONTO!!!!!!!,"the girl has lost her mind(did she have one in the first place?!?!?!?)HEY,'NETTE,THE MOVIE TANKED BECUASE IT STUNK!!!!!!IF YOU FEEL YOU NEED TO CREATE EXCUSES FOR IT ONLY SURVIVING 1 DAY IN THE THEATERS,THEN HAVE AT IT.AND WHAT YOU FAIL TO REALIZE IS THAT THERE ARE SOME OF US HERE WHO ARE WEALTHY.AND FURTHERMORE,THE REVIEWS A MOVIE GETS(GOOD OR BAD)MAKES A DIFFERENCE!!!!!!DUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MAYBE A REMAKE OF SANFORD AND SON SHOULD DO BETTER?!?!?!?!?"
2,To the Moon Alice,"I was greatly disappointed by this movie. You would think with Mike Epps,Cedric the Enterainer, and John Leguzimo this would be a funnier movie. But alas it wasn't it was unoriginal as it not funny. However the actress Regina Hall character as Trixie is fresh and funny. Poor Gabrielle Union again such an amazing actress stuck in another lifeless movie. I couldn't recommended this as DVD movie or rental. Skip this altogether."
1,i missed my chance,"one day this was in the theater,the next it was gone.no news paper reviewed it and there were no commercials.why am i NOT surprised?!?!?!?!?!?!?the cast of the GREAT ORIGINAL TV SHOW MUST BE ROLLING AROUND IN THEIR GRAVES AT SUCH A LAME AND UNFUNNY MOVIE VERSION!!!!!!!!the 1/2 hour tv show had more heart,laughs,talent,originality,PLOT,than this pile of fecal matter.i no longer blame hollwood for releasing such garbage.they know theres enough guffawing idiots who will pay for this and anything else it has to offer.these are sad days indeed.btw,anyone notice these so called comedians are absolutely corny when they cant use foul language?!?!?!?!?"
1,JACKIE GLEASON IS ROLLING OVER IN HIS GRAVE!!!!!!,"THIS WAS A HORRIBLE MOVIE....HORRIBLE ACTING!! WHOEVER THOUGHT OF MAKING THIS REMAKE WITH A BLACK CAST HAS HALF A BRAIN!!WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA! WHY NOT DO A REMAKE OF ""THE JEFFERSONS"" WITH NICOLE KIDMAN AND BEN STILLER??? GET MY POINT?"
2,OKAY MOVIE. NOW THEY JUST HAVE TO DO THE HONEYMOONERS,IT WAS A OKAY MOVIE WITH SOME FUNNY MOMENTS. THE PROBLEM WAS THE MOVIE BORE LITTLE RESEMBALNCE TO THE HONEYMOONERS. THE 50'S SITCOM WAS MORE LIKE A ONE ACT PLAY WHERE YOU NEVER LEFT THE KRAMDEN'S CRAMP BROOKYLN APARTMENT. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS CHANGE THE NAMES OF THEIR NAMES. MAKE RALPH A CAB DRIVER AND YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT MOVIE.
1,i wanted to see this is the theaters but......,"it was gone almost as soon.a true blessing in disguise!!!!!!!! an afrocentric friend of mine had this playing and i had to see just how terrible this really was.no bad review even from a pist off simon cowell of amer idol fame can give this turd it just desserts.of course my friend was cracking up while the rest of us started heading for another room.it seems if an ''actor'' has bills to pay,movies like this come in handy.LMMFAO @ ''special collectors edition''....if youre a collector of garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,It Captures the Spirit,"Like many people, I am an aficionado of the classic TV series. Since most remakes or ""tribute"" films of venerable television shows are not successful and because this movie received such poor reviews, I did not see it until recently. The poor reviews are not justified. This film captures the essence and spirit of the immortal show and does so with its overall theme of working class people trying, usually unsuccessfully, to ""make it"". The references and insertion of scenes and dialogue evocative of the classic are well done and very well placed in the script. This cast studied the original and got it right. This film is a rarity - one worthy of the classic it emulates. Perhaps you had to be there at the time the original was made to know how well this film works."
1,Dreadful!,This was dreadful. What a slap to the face to the Classic. Almost worse than the Bush Administration over the last 8 years.
1,This is NOT the TV classic,"I found this during search for ""TV classics and Honeymooners"" and was unaware of this movie satire based on the TV show. With no picture, product description or review, I ordered thinking it was the original."
1,Couldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it,"This was so bad I wouldn't watch more than the first 5 minutes of it. If you have to watch it, watch it, but don't say I told you so."
1,Jackie Gleason got dissed badly by this mess,"can't believe this film actually got green-lighted or saw the light of day.I have always dug Cedric the Entertainer,but His best Comedy Routines thus far have been either on the Steve harvey show,bud commericals or His stand ups over the years&His Book.but His films are truly Brutal Bad for the most part.this tv show was very important back in the day&for it to get served up like this is a bad joke. nothing about this film was funny except it got green lighted.the company must have said we need a tax write off&then said ok put this junk out because nobody in there right mind would release this Mess.thsi Film has going ""WOOD"" written all over it."
1,Why? The Original Show Was Bad Enough!,"I'm finally catching a glimpse of this movie on network cable TV, as it's not something I would have seen at the theater or bought on DVD. All I can say is ""Why?"" I thought the original, black and white, fifties version of the show sucked, and even my favorite actors can't redeem it in a movie version. The original show was horrible then; this movie is horrible now. Why Ced and Mike Epps and Gabby didn't try and put their immense good looks and talent into another vehicle I'll never know. But oh well, at least we have two of the three in ""Cadillac Records"" and two out of three ain't bad.By the way--I can agree with the reviewers who said that maybe the color lines shouldn't have been crossed. If white actors showed up in a big screen remake of ""Good Times"" or ""Martin"" or ""Amos n Andy"" or ""What's Happening"" I'd be UP IN ARMS and protesting the studio!"
5,The best of Cossacks,I've enjoyed this game since it first came out. I like all the games of this kind. American Conquest is another one. I wish they would make more of these types of games. I didn't like the new versions though different kind of play all together. This game just barely plays on windows 7. Please make more of these games. CDV is the maker.
5,EXCELLENT INFORMATION-FILLED BOOK!!!!!!!,"This book is fun for children and adults. It gives much much information about caring for hamsters that can really be of use. Take it from me; this book has helped me so much! It talks about your hamster's needs and wants, ""do""s and ""don't""s, breeding, cage information and much more! This book is highly recommended by me."
5,Excellent Resource for New Hamster Owners!,"When I read the other reviews for this book, I expected it to have more text and not very many pictures. When it arrived, I realized that I was way off! There are LOTS of pictures that are super cute and really entertaining, and it's not skimpy with the important information either! While it's appropriate for younger children, I'm a teenager and it doesn't make me feel like an idiot either. I would recommend this book for anyone who is going to be getting a hamster, or already has one and wants to learn more about them!"
5,Well made,"This is a well made, heavy duty tool. Quality is getting harder to find. You won't be disappointed with this trowel."
4,Great Swan Song for an Amazing Band!,"In a span of five years, five albums, and three personnel changes, the magic that was My Scarlet Life comes to a close here. The songs are dreamy and yet tight, with a kind of behind the scenes angst hinting at the breakup to come. It begins with the songs Don't Make Me and Promise, rises in The Garden of Love and Pure Denial, and ends with haunting sadness of So Frail. If there is one thing to be said of any project fronted by lead composer Preston Klik, it is that however short lived they are, they are never short of excellent. Out of the ashes of his last great band Big Hat, My Scarlet Life arose, and its demise only fortells of greater heights to be reached in the future. Listeners will anxiously await them."
5,Delightful!,"When I was a wee one, this was one of my favourite books. Little Howard is delivered in a basket to loving but childless parents, who notice his unnaturally long nose. They try to ascertain the cause of his malformation, as he has trouble eating doughnuts and often runs into walls. He's fixated on a tree outside the house, and often tries to climb it. One day he gets too high and can't be reached and won't come down. As time passes his arms turn to wings, and his once unnatural nose turns to a beak that suits his new form much better. He flies south with the other birds, but always comes back to visit the parents who cared for him.The illustrations are charming, the story sublime. I recommend this book for young children, aged up to 5 or 6."
1,Poorly done,"I was looking for a book that would help me brush up on my financial math and this does not do the job. Day does a poor job of explaining the material, and furthermore, his CD is poorly done. He does not enter most of the formulas, but rather he hard coats his numbers. This makes it just about impossible to follow what he is talking about in his book as the reader must somehow come up with the formulas that he is describing on his own. Day does a great job of protecting his models from being copied as no one would want to recreate the formulas he is using, but in doing so, he prevents the reader from learning. If you are looking for a good book on financial mathematics, this is not it."
2,A reference book rather than teaching guide,I have an MBA in Managerial Economics and was looking for a review in financial math w/ Excel illustrations. I purchased this book and returned it because it is poorly written and/or a reference book for someone who already knows the material rather than a teaching guide. Another book which appears more suitable for my purposes is 'Finance Guide With Formulated Solutions for Excel' by Roger Bennitt.
3,Arnold's UNauthorized biography,"This my may not be the best book you will ever read, but if you're interested in information about Arnold, this is not a bad choice. The author mentions all the obstacles he had in writing this book and does not try to make it seem like it is an authorized biography in any way. He does give you a look at Arnold without the childish self-promoting efforts that Arnold's autobiography seems to try. This is a fun book, with a slight edge to it like you're reading something that might have been printed in a tabloid were it not printed in a book. You can almost feel like you are sneeking around with the author trying to find out information about Arnold that is not some sort of publicity stunt. It might not be the most fair look at Arnold, but then again neither is Arnold's autobiography. I think the real story might be found somewhere in between the two books."
1,Bunch of bull,"This author is out to make Arnold look bad, not to sure about this book...I think its a bunch of BS myself. Arnold is a true Idol, a star, a person someone wants to be. This guy makes Arnold out to be a pure bonified *%*$*@*...I do not believe the bullcrap from this book at all..."
5,Well built rack mount. Nothing more nothing less,A good set of ears. Ready for a solid audio rack and perfectly measured for your Panamax gear. Good stock of aluminum too.
3,The book was a complete dissappointment,"I have read ""Ella Imagina"" and ""Tonto, muerto, bastardo e invisible"" and this last one ""El desorden de tu nombre"" was a real dissappointment.It is easilly read, but it is a very predictable book."
3,"History provides insight, but specific projects are dated.","If you've always wondered what the hoopla over the Media Lab was all about, this book can help fill in the blanks. It covers the basics about the founding of the lab and provides a little biographical background on people like Negroponte and Minsky.However, a large portion of the book is spent describing specific projects, many of which are obviously a little out of date. Don't get the wrong idea, though. These projects were obviously very exciting when new. Further, some of the projects still seem so far out that I would not be surprised to see them announced as new research in 2000!All in all, recommended. But perhaps you're better off skimming a copy from your local library than buying this one. That's why 3 stars instead of 4."
1,ABOVE SAN FRANCISCO (sent 9-05-2008),"Actually, i was NOT AT ALL SATISFIED.The product was NOT NEW, AS I WANTED & AS I ORDERED.it was a GIFT, SENT TO A 3RD PARTY,THUS i was very embarrassed,when the gift was described to me.PS: i since ordered another copy from Amazon (sept 19, 2008AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR AMAZON TO ADVISE THAT DELIVERYWAS (EVEN) SHIPPED. This a second VERY POOR SERVICEEXPERIENCE. I am very shocked & disappointed with thistype of AMAZON service."
5,Excellent Souvenir for the City by the Bay!,"Whenever we have friends or relatives visit from out-of-state or overseas, we give them a copy of this excellent picture book. This works particularly well for our non-English speaking visitors who may peruse the pages - remembering all the exciting places we've visited during their stay!"
5,Soaring San Francisco,"I have always been a big fan of Robert Carmeron's work, I really feel he is the best at this kind of photography. This book is amazing, San Francisco never looked better and that is really saying something. Mr. Carmeron is from the Bay Area so he saves some of his best work for this book, which has been gloriously updated. The views and angles he gets are nothing short of spectacular. San Francisco is one of the worlds most beautiful cities and it's really saying something when a book can guild the lilly like this one. I highly recommend it to anyone with a love for this great city or just a love of great photography."
5,great mat,"I've had this floor mat for a few weeks now and it's great. It's inside my building, so I don't know how it stands up to outside weather, but I would assume it would be fine. It's very durable, and I recommend it."
4,It Fits My Bill,"This booklet published before Eric Clapton released Pilgrim. It serves the purpose of outling each of Eric Clapton's songs and a summary of their recordings. A very detailed description of each track is given. I especially enoy the descriptions of Eric's guitar styles on many of the songs. Helpful for those debating whether to purchase a particular recording. Yes, there are some slight biases. However, the author does not make his opinion too overbearing. And besides most of his thoughts are pretty compatible with mine. A nice pocket size booklet for Eric Clapton fans."
5,Is that it?,"A wonderfully crafted autobiography. Honest and personal, Geldof puts the first half of his life under the microscope and you grow to love him for his warts and scars.A riveting book especially for those who recall the music of his era. You will laugh and you may cry even if it is only because the book ends years short of the present day."
4,Watch out.,"This is a great tool for ease of travel, but watch out for the stretching of the aluminum. I have owned mine for over 3 years and I always take care and put it away folded up, but recently my cuts were traveling out of square by 1/4. I checked the play and it did move just enough to make it out of square. I believe the aluminum has stretched just enough with normal use. Great tool for drywall because you can adjust the depth and score drywall off in rips and accuracy is not as important. Just be carefull when marking off plywood."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"After 15 months the screen on this product would turn orange as soon as it was turned on and then would fade to black. When I called Philips support line they said they couldn't do anuthing about it since it was way out of warranty (I didn't think 3 months was way out of warranty, but so be it). So I asked what Philips service center could I bring the item it to be repaired at and they said the authorized service centers typically don't repair these items so I was out of luck. This item cost $200+ when I bought it and now it is garbage after just 15 months. This is the last Philips product I will ever buy."
2,Virtually no control over what is being displayed,"While I didn't expect a LOT from a simple digital frame, I at least expected to be able to select one specific folder to display all pics, or even to select a group of pictures to display. Instead, it's an ""ALL or NOTHING"" proposition. Your frame will display EVERYTHING in its memory, or nothing - there is no control whatsoever. SO, if you want to change what is shown, you have to change the memory card or the internal memory (translate - connect and disconnect from your computer) every single time. Not very smart. It would have taken very little to let you go through the menu and select which folder of photos it should display. Also, the buttons are not intuitive at all, and the manual is almost useless. The quality of the image however, is good."
4,Great Purchase,"I read everyone's comments before purchasing this. I am happy that I did. Using the buttons are easy and looking at the frame from the front all the buttons work properly, I don't even have to flip it over. I also like how clear and crisp the pictures look. I tried connecting it to my computer but I have a little problem. So for now I just select the pictures right from my memory card in my camera which for me works just fine! I have received many complements from everyone who has seen it on my desk. I love it and recommend that if you are looking for one this is it."
5,"Excellent Frame, Excellent Price","First things first, the picture in this frame is beautiful. The 720 x 480 resolution and rich color display of this frame beats the earlier generation digital picture frame I have hands down. The display and the price are this frame's strongest attributes, and more than outweigh its negatives. The picture frame's interface can be a little klunky (for lack of a better word), but that characteristic certainly isn't unique to this frame. The software that comes with the frame has been panned in earlier reviews, and, while it is far from robust, it seems to get the job done. The picture frame obviously doesn't have some of the features of higher-end frames (Wi-Fi, etc) but since I bought this for my wife to take to work, that really isn't an issue. One feature that it does have that would be useful in her case is the ability to automatically turn on/off at certain times. To sum it all up, as I said in the title, this is an excellent digital frame at an excellent price."
3,overrated,"The Philips digital frame does not support many memory cards and does not even have a slot for a memory stick. It doesn't support our XD card and with the lack of a memory stick port, I have to take the frame to my desktop and upload it. Not very practical. On the positive note, its adapter does pluck into other circuits (European)."
2,Plexiglass Frame Bows,"I can't recommend this digital frame from Philip. After only seven months of displaying the unit on a shelf, the interchangeable frame and the metal bars behind the frame were falling off. The reason was that the Plexiglas frame had bowed.However, Philips gladly sent me a new one. It cost me to ship it back to them. Since no other reviewer mentioned this same problem, I hope I will not have the same problem in seven months with this new digital frame.I found it very easy to load pictures on from my computer."
1,it comes only one,"It comes only one and it breaks as sone as you touch it, imagine that! The company very nice they refund me the money."
4,essential if unexciting,"The problem with the Ethereal Plane is the same for DM's and PC's alike: It's a vast (virtually) featureless nothing. The waveless sea that is the Deep Ethereal is just a chore. The demiplanes are scary, and the border is handy for PC's on the Prime, but the deep is nothing more, as far as this DM is concerned, than the worst way to get to the Inner Planes. The staff did a marvelous job at sqeezing every bit of potential interest out of this onerous chore, but on the Ethereal, the DM has a challenge to make it more than what it is. Buy this book, but think of it as a reference text, because at some point, there will be that trivial tidbit you needed."
2,"Too broad, some misconceptions","I was first impressed with Eduardo Miranda's book ""Computer Sound Design"" but as I read more, I realized that this ambitious survey of sound synthesis over-generalizes and even criticizes mature well-accepted techniques. Admittedly, the scope of the book is vast, but I can't help feel that the approach to most topics is far too cursory for the book to be more than a reference to other works.I was very disappointed with chapter 3, ""Spectrum Modelling Approaches"" as it not only was a terse white-wash of spectral synthesis techniques, there were multiple instances of unfounded criticism for the rich field of spectral signal processing and its growing constituency of pracitioners. It would have been much more effective for Miranda to simply admit his lack of expertise in the area without providing false unfounded judgements."
1,Salmon Jerky,"Poor value for the price. $27.99 for six ounces? That makes it almost $75 a pound for an ordinary and unexceptional product. I've learned my lesson, never again!"
1,Reconsatuted,This is more reconstituted than jerky. I sit out my bite and threw the bag away. The person taking it threw it away.
4,Billy has a hit with this one!!,"TIME FLIES is truly a wonderful album. Though I may be a bit biased cause I've been a fan for so long, I truly think this is some of Billy's best work since his original ""Achy Breaky Heart"" days. It's great to hear some of the songs from his TV series DOC show up on the album, in addition to an acoustic version of ""Some Gave All"" - which everyone loves! The new single ""Back To Memphis"" very solid as well. I highly recommend TIME FLIES to anyone who's BRS fan, or country fan in general. My advice is to go pick up the album!"
3,Billy Ray has his ups and downs.,I was impressed by Billy Ray Cyrus' songs on a TV show he starred in and wanted to get some of his recordings. So far I have purchased 7. I like some of his work but find it a little uneven in quality. I probably won't purchase any more but I will still use the seller and keep what I have bought.
3,Cute but beware!,"I am using this for work. I do early intervention, the kids love it and it feels great but the top battery cover falls off very easy. I am always searching for the batteries in the bottom of my bag because every trip it opens. I would go for the standard adult model next time."
5,from didn't-know-I-was-a-poetry fan,I was always intimidated and shut out of understanding verse. I heard Dr. Kelly Norman Ellis read on the documentary about Affrilachian poets and wanted to explode wildly in applause in front of the TV in my one bedroom apartment. Her poetry is pervious and spreads out like a delicious feast! You must read through this book out loud and feel the ways the words feel inside your mouth because it's delightful. I am going to use some of her poems with my second-language students because the sounds beautifully transcend the language.
5,2nd review of a great book,"I last posted on April 16th and am still doing the rites. I have felt great ever since I started them and will do them the rest of my life if I can. I can feel the difference when I practice them every day and when I haven't done them for a few days, I'm more sluggish. I've found out that when I just do 10 of them I'm able to do them more often. For some reason the idea of doing 21 makes me want to put them off. I've derived great benefit from just doing 10 of them each day. I was wondering if some grey hair would go away. For some reason I thought the gray would diminish uniformly; in some areas it's as gray as before but in other areas it seems to have diminished a lot, it's noticable. When friends remark how much younger and healthier I look I tell them about the rites. Some go and buy the book, others that don't probably don't believe it. They're really missing out, I can't say enough about how much this book has done for me."
4,Interesting concept,I am still reading and learning. I always read through then read in detail the second time. Exercises are difficult but working great!
2,No results,"I wonder were those positives reviews come from...I've practiced the 5 rites for 2 years now 21 times a day, hardly ever skipping a day, but have not noticed any change..I don't look any younger than other people my age.. Not really motivating to keep on practicing the 5 rites...How come the seem to work miracles for others but dont produce any results for me??????????"
3,So-So,"I purchased this book by Kelder,(no Bernie Siegel) about ten years ago, I was 58 then, I performed the exercises faithfully for six months. The only results I received were those I would have doing any other set of exercises."
2,Not Really Secrets - Nothing Unusual,"The book leads you on a bit that the secrect of youth is going to be revealed and really , except for the spinning rite, the others are forms of yoga exercises, stretches or isometrics which you can find in any good yoga exercise book. There is a section on giving up sex and rechanneling that energy, if you want to. The lost chapter is just about making affirmations. The spinning is the only thing fairly different (Tibetan Whirling Dervishes), although I have done it in a yoga class. Since the rites/exercises are easy, I plan to do them, just in case the combination just happens to be the fountain of youth. The book's value is that it is small, though wordy at times, and it puts together a program you can do easily and quickly and will be of some value to your body and mine and which could become a nice habit/ritual to stay with ""forever."" It could also make an interesting gift."
2,Fiction or Non-fiction?,"The book offer some great yogo movements that I'm sure can be beneficial, but has anyone applying the program as Mr Kelder outlined ever turned back the clock?"
1,Very shallow and non-informative.,"The exercises in this book are similar to yoga except they are too strenuous for anyone and can hurt spine or knees if an individual has joint problems. Anyone doing yoga would get the same effects. On the subject of diet, Fit For Life has the same principles."
1,Not For Everyone.,"Blah, blah, blah. It's just another exercise book. The only difference is it ties in to spiritual stuff. The main audience for this book are people who like all that chakra/astral vibration jazz. Not for people who want practical advice because the author can't seem to stay ""earthbound"" but has to talk about yoga culture ideas whenever possible."
3,GET THIS BOOK ONLINE FOR FREE,You can get this book free by doing a super simple and very quick internet search. You can find it online in text (searchable) or pdf version for free.
2,Okay; but don't believe the hype,"This is an okay book. The story is sweet (however wastes many pages) and the Rites are good, basic yoga. It's yoga, not magic, make no mistake. After doing the five Rites (21 times each) for a few weeks I felt good; about as good as you can feel doing light yoga. But you are not going to loose a lot of weight. Bald men are not going to grow hair. And you are not going to look half your age (one story in the book tells of a man over 70 who, after doing the Rites, looks under 40!)If you are very old and do nothing and start doing this, you should feel better. But really, do not believe all the insane stuff that people are writing here. Seriously, if half this stuff were true word of mouth would be huge and the entire world would be doing this and no one would ever gain weight, be bald, have gray hair, need a cane, be sick and we'd all live to be 125."
5,A Youthful Body is Attainable,"I have ready many books that claim they have the secret to youth and they have all fallen short, until now! The Tibetan Llamas have revealed their well kep secrets and if you would like to know how to appear and feel more youthful, then you definately want to buy this book."
5,It's interesting that's for sure!,"This book introduces you to the Tibetan rites of Rejuvenation! It's a series of odd exercises developed in the monasteries of Tibet. It claims to increase energy, help with memory, weight loss, and even help you look younger.These excises are fairly simple for a healthy person to do, and I would imagine very difficult for people with various disabilities. I've done them on and off for several years. They do seem to boost your energy. It's a fun book."
5,Thanks!!!,"The book was sent timely and was in very good shape, as described! Thanks so much! I was so happy to find it! BB"
5,"A must read and ""do"" for all!","This book is wonderful. I have studied and practiced yoga for decades, this is a synopsis of what should be a part of everyone's daily ritual. The 5 rites are the foundation to longevity and vibrant health. I have recently started doing the ""rites"" every morning on rising 21+ reps of all exercises. I cannot make a stronger recommendation than, You must do this! It is not an option. Start with as few as you need, but stick with it daily and keep with it, you will benefit in ways I cannot describe. Just do it! Live long and prosper, you health is your most valuable possession, care for it wisely."
4,Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth,"Excellent, SIMPLE, yoga exercises used by a person in incredible back painand he reserected himself. My wife and I asked how.This was his answer."
3,A Young Don Gibson,"There are good songs on this CD, but Don Gibson's voice has not matured, or the studio where this particular CD was recorded did not have accustics to help enhance his voice."
5,New Moon Astrology-Great read and reference,"This is a great way to set goals... and accomplish them, even if you are a ""non-believer"" in Astrology! It's the kind of book you will keep coming back to as a reference... if you have outcomes you want, you will come back to it every new moon at the very least."
1,Bull____!,I fell for all the great reviews. I got the book and tried writing down my wishes and or intentions every month on the new moon for months. Even had my husband try it and guess what? Were still wishing! Save your money!
1,Not to be trusted,"The author gives an unjustified pride of place to the Hebrew language as the source of the Greek alphabet (that was actually the Phoenicians) and as the first to adopt vowels (that achievement is the Ugaritians', assuming you fail to credit, e.g., Akkadian, which has different signs for different consonant-vowel combinations) and spends a great deal of time spinning out Josephus' idea about the proper pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton without giving Josephus any credit, not even so much as a footnote citation. This author has no real academic credentials and is strangely intent on proving some kook-ish theories. In fact, Hebrew is just one of many very similar Northwest Semitic dialects that happened to survive because more of it was written down. It has no particular pedigree, and certainly not one that could justify the author's worshipful approach."
3,A disappointment,"Mr. Hoffman fills many pages telling us what we don't know or don't know for sure about biblical Hebrew, but devotes almost no space to telling the reader in clear, concise language what we do know. There is no simple table telling the reader what the pronunciations were or probably were for each letter at each stage of Hebrew's development. There is no table or list showing how the same thought might have been expressed in early biblical Hebrew, late biblical Hebrew, rabbinic Hebrew and modern Hebrew. The reader must puzzle it all out for himself - and, of course, cannot. And there are some probable errors, such as the idea that the sound of the undageshed tav in biblical Hebrew could realistically have been /s/. The book is also marred by a large number of typographical errors, many of which should have been caught by a simple spell-check program, and the rest by simple proof-reading."
4,Good information on not well known topic,I found the information useful on a topic that is not written upon often. Good artwork in the book and the writing is good. A very good book on the topic and I would suggest it for anyone interested in this topic.
3,"On ""Renaissance War Galley""","The articles are well written and documented, the drawings good, but the quality of the pictures are just horrible!"
5,Swimming is now as easy as walking!,"I began swimming a few months ago in preparation for my first triathlon. Although I could run a marathon with energy to spare, I could barely cross the pool once without gasping. After struggling twice a week for a couple of months, a friend told me about Total Immersion.I went online and read the first three chapters (for free at the Total Immersion website) and saw significant improvement in my swimming effort. I purchased Triathlon Swimming Made Easy, and have not even finished the book yet, but have seen tremendous improvement in my speed and energy output. Last time I got out of the pool, after swimming more than a mile, I felt like I had just taken a stroll around the block. But best of all, my fastest friend at the pool, who began her mile swim at the same time as me, couldn't lap me!Speed and ease of swimming are the benefits of employing the methods in this book. Read it and get faster while saving your energy for other parts of your triathlon."
4,Dive in!,"This book literally changes the way you think about swimming. We are taught how to swim from an early age, but don't really ""think"" about it. I went from struggling through two laps to swimming over a thousand yards, and I haven't even finished the book yet. I am training for my first triathlon and was very nervous about the swim. Not anymore."
4,Motivating and useful,"Total Immersion focuses on a swimming technique that will make you swim easier without struggle. It is an easy read and provides handles to swim better and get more comfortable in the water. The book alone is not enough to learn this technique. You will also need the DVD and perhaps the drill cards for the practices. The book is written in a ""can do it"" style and is motivating to read with useful information."
2,Lots of good info.... but,"This book has lots of good info, and will change the way you swim, but it can be really confusing. He seems to say way too much about nothing. Really, just get the video. The book rambles on and on and on, but the video you can just see what you need to do."
3,"Some good information, but alot of unnecessary filler","This book seemed more self serving than instructional. There were good pieces of information, but they were sandwiched around pages of the author telling you how revolutionary his ideas are and how successful his methods have been. The book could have been cut down significantly by removing this fluff, and it would have made for a better read. Everytime I got to a new chapter, I had to sift through pages of filler before I got to any good material. I mean I already bought the book, he doesn't need to continue selling his ideas to me, I can try them out and decide for myself.Also, I haven't tried to DVD, but I suspect it would be better because it would be easier to visualize the techniques he writes about."
5,Turning back the clock,"I'm remembering how great it used to feel when I swam squad 25years ago. After only a couple of weeks reading I've been able to improve my swimming and swim easier and faster than my training partner. I no longer fear swim training and feel myself getting better every visit to the pool. The writing style is easy to follow and motivational, if only the DVD was included as a bundle it'd be perfect."
4,Worth getting,"I purchased this book because I was about to do my first triathlon ever, and I had no idea how to swim properly. I also purchased a total immersion dvd, and although I think you can get by with just the dvd, I recommend getting the book as well. The book offers a lot of insight into why the author wants you to do specific exercises, and it's definitely worth reading. Between the book and dvd, I was able to get through an olympic and half-ironman distance triathlon. The only shortcomings of these products is that they offer almost no instruction on proper breathing and kicking your legs, two things that I ironed out in a swim lesson."
3,Total Immersion swimming,The book overall is well written. The drills are very hard to understand and perform. It seems that to get a better idea of how to perform them you need to buy the DVD.Not an out of the box self help book. It will require the purchase of the DVD or hire a coach to help with the drills.I would recommemd purchasing the book but do not pay new price; pick up a used copy.
5,Great Documentary,This is an excellent documentary of Petey Greene's life. I wish I knew about him when he was alive. Kudos to all responsible for putting it together.
3,Adjust your color - a missed opportunity,"Very informative and nicely done. It was a crime this or any other recording or footage was never included on the DVD for ""Talk to Me"" - the very well done bio pic with Don Cheadle. They should have been ashamed of themselves."
5,I can set my own pace in learning step by step,"I am in my late sixties and with these easy to follow instructions I can set my own pace in learning the movements, step by step. Jamie Moffet's Five Element Qigong exercises are a wonderful way to energize my body and set a positive mental attitude to approach my daily activities. And I love that.Mary N. H., Homemaker,Caregiver and Artist"
2,OK for rough cuts but watch how you use it.,"I have used this guide often for ripping sheet stock with a circular saw. However, do not expect accurate cuts from this, especially when you are making 8' rips. The guide flexes WAY too much toward the middle. It has little to do with the connector. The guide is just not substantial enough to resist flexing. If you put any pressure against it with your circular saw (as one tends to do when using a tool guide), you will have a cut that bows outward in the middle on one piece, and concave on the other piece.I have recently retired this guide for more expensive and more substantial all-in-one clamp and tool guides that do not flex.Bottom line, if all you need is a quick and rough cut, this is a handy tool. But if you demand a straight cut, pay more money and get a tool guide that resists flexing."
1,Not Straight,I have tried three of these straight edges now and they all have a bend at the joint. I examined the last one with a machinist's square and found that none of the corners are square. I can cut a better right angle on my table saw. If you want two 4 ft straight edges it will work fine. You will have to have an 8 ft straight edge to hold the two 4 ft sections against while you clamp them together to make this device straight.
1,Johnson Level & Tool J4900 98-Inch Aluminum Cutting Guide,Not able to use it! When it arrived the 'C' clamps and screws for the extension were missing. It states right on the packaging that it includes 2 'C' clamps and 4 screws. I contacted the supplier and they said they would ship the missing items but I still haven't received anything. You can't use it without 'C' clamps. I purchased on 9-16-07 and it's now 10-19-07 and still no clamps or screws. I'm very disappointed with the customer service!
3,quick and easy,Quick and easy review after a long lapse in learning calculus. Working examples are explained step by step.
2,Doesn't cover enough for the amount of time & cost.,"I have compared this 8 hour video set, which cost $35 with other types of calculus videos that are easily available (many are free on Youtube). I would say, for the amount of time spent on this video, the author didn't cover enough or at least didn't give enough examples. He took too much time repeating the same phrases during his lecturing (which wasn't necessary, since it's a video that people can rewind, when they miss something), so the time he ended up wasting could have been used for more examples. I wouldn't recommend this video for calculus learners, because there are many free ones on youtube that are far better, and well explained for clear understanding. If the price for this video was $15, then I would say it's not bad."
3,It's good enough to get by a class in Calc. I,"I think its a good video for gaining a better insight into problem solving (learning how to solve problems in a calculus way). Just like the saying ""practice makes perfect"". However,I just feel it lacks in giving you a good explanation of the theory behind the formulas. He does give a few visual examples of what a derivative and an integral mean graphically. Overall, I bought it because I recently had to take calculus 2 and had took calculus I three years ago and needed to review calculus I; and it served its purpose. I just wish someone would come out with a dvd set like this one that would better explain the concepts and the many different graphical ways of showing how calculus really works and can be used."
2,Basic,I bought this product thinking it would bring my calculus to a higher level. It didn't. The product covers the most basic examples which you can follow in your text if you are taking a class which would be the main reason you buy this DVD. This product was not helpful in doing the higher number problems at the end of the chapters let alone the problems on tests which require insight and creativity. This is the most basic of explanations of Calculus which most people should be able to follow in each chapter of their text.
5,Best tutor out there.,"If you're looking to finally ""make it click"" with any level of math, then, look no further. Jason does a great job of making it clear and concise. Nice job!!!"
2,Dont waste your time,"The videos are a pretty good over view. But if you are needing them to help with a Calc class, they fall short. There are much more helpful and specific videos for free on the internet... check youtube."
3,A little light,"This dvd set was little better than most I have used (the majority are not worth the time) but is still aimed very much at beginners. Covers the major topics, good for review and supplementary viewing."
1,worthless,"I bought this DVD for a business math MBA class I am in that heavily uses differential calculus. I learned nothing from this DVD and I'm not sure how anyone could. Ok, it defined a derivative. It mentioned the chain rule. But there are five other rules needed to calculate most derivatives (constant function, power function, sums and differences rule, product rule, quotient rule). This did not show me how to look at the problem and know how to solve it. Luckily we've moved on to statistics in the class, so there's still hope of me passing it, but the calculus part was a disaster."
2,Beware on Delivery - No Seller Responses,"Ordered late August. Two day delivery paid for. No delivery. After a series of emails, each one a tag more P.O'oed than the one before....and NONE were responded to. I finally threatened to go to AMAZON to get this resolve. Only THEN was the product delivered.Approximately THREE weeks after ordering, it was finally shipped out.The product may or may NOT BE good and of itself, just don't expect to actually GET it before the semester is over."
5,Extremely Helpful DVD,This dvd cuts out all the fluff and gets right to the meat of what you need to learn in your first semester of calculus. Definitely worth the price if you don't have the time to find a study group or go to a tutor. Highly Recommended.
4,Quaint Biography,"Compared to other biographies of Catherine Booth this one has the most personality. The author obviously wrote this as a labor of love and it was originally published shortly after Booth's death. It does provide accurate (as far as I know) biographical details, but the style is very saccharine."
4,great buy,"Checked with music store and was quoted over $600.00. More than I wantedto spend for a beginning student. Purchased this one and it works well. Only thing I would like is to have a stand for both the bell and drum head, instead of having to switch constantly."
1,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this book. It was filled with quite a lot of advice, but the problem is that the advice is very impractical. The book contains some cute pictures but the information provided leaves me wondering if the author has ever owned ferrets. Suggestions such as taping a mat to the carpet to prevent the ferrets from digging??? Anyone who has ever owned a ferret will tell you that a ferret will rip apart the tape in a matter seconds to get under the mat. Very little useful information is provided and could cause problems for new ferrets owners. Contrary to the previous reviews of this book, I have to say that it was not worth buying as it is impractical and often ridiculous in its offerings."
1,"Trite, affectatious waste of ink",Do authors needing to start every thought with inane questions make you giggle more than thorazine? Do you have have commercial grade insulin handy for inoculations after every annacdote {which is on par with Elvis sightings?). Then this book is for you.Having raised seven and now that my girlfriend has added eight and nine ferrets I feel I a qualified to comment on the usefulness of this book - nil. We added this book to qualify for free shipping while ordering Ferrets for Dummies - a much better buy. {loads of valuable info}Read Ferrets for Dummies and if you have a bird line the bird cage with with Ms. Somerville's exercise in ferret dreaming.
3,"Okay, but not for every ferret","My ferrets are either too smart or too stupid to be trained. The pictures were cute, but I couldn't find anything in it that I didn't already know from Ferrets for Dummies or Modern Ferret magazine. I read it once and gave it to the local humane society's library."
4,Truck bed mattress - Wow,"This thing is great! Fits well into the back of my '06 Tacoma. leaves enough room around wheel wells to stash my boots at night, easy setup. Compressor that came with it did a fine job - only took about 2 minutes to fill. With a good sleeping bag - my 28deg night was quite enjoyable."
3,not bad,"This was a pretty decent action movie with a twist near the end that made the film even better. Unfortunately there were also some moments near the middle of the film that dragged with unnecessary mushy romantic segments. These segments shouldn't have been included in a film dealing with bad guys and gansters killing each other for much of the story. The romantic bits felt completely pointless to me.This was a pretty good movie if you ask me. Wasn't great, wasn't incredible or revolutionary in the world of action movies, but entertaining enough to give it a passing grade and a film I recommend watching.You'd probably expect plenty of guns and violence and bloody scenes. Well, you somewhat get that, but the storyline didn't focus on the violent aspect as much as you think.Still, I liked it. Movies like this have become underrated these days it seems since people tend to ignore them."
3,Innotek 2 dog basic trainer,"The vender and the product delivered a quality product in a timely manner. A good price so no complaints regarding the transaction or the product. I would caution dog owners to use discretion with this product. Personnally, I purchased the trainer to interupt very bad behaviors either that were in process or imminent. I do not agree that one should use this collar for basic command training, but would suggest other methods. It will stop bad behaviors (e.g. running out into the street, chasing the neighbors cats, running away and possibly into danger). Overuse could lead to timidness or fear-like behavior in some dogs."
3,Not bad..,"Bought this for my 2 dogs, a Siberian Husky and a Doberman. Being reluctant to use an e-collar on our dogs, when the units arrived, we used them on ourselves...The stimulation at the highest setting is not too much more than feeling a pin prick.While it worked great with our short hair doberman, I think my huskys dense coat affected how he reacted, sometimes it would work, other times it wouldn't.Comes with eveything you need and replacement batteries were found at Menards for a decent price."
4,Training collars,"These collars work really well. I have two dogs so I needed two different color collars with one control. I really wanted a ""vibrate"" only mode, before the shock, but really that is what the low shock amounts to. I do not ever use the highest level of shock, so if your dog needs a really strong correction, I cannot suggest this brand (yet)!"
4,Awesome workout,"This is an awesome workout. I am an intermediate stepper and found this to be incredibly challenging. It takes a few times thru to get all the moves down, but once you do it's really fun. Also, Kari and Jay are terrific instructors. They cue really well and the fact that they are ""tag-teaming"" makes the workout fly. Before you know it, you're stetching out. Great addition to any collection.I hope that this is the first of more videos together with them."
3,complicated set up,once we figured out the setup it seems to work well. we have been monitoring our progress regularly with good results from this unit.
4,Exciting experiential inner work.,"Jeremy Taylor invites us to look inside of ourselves for healing. He takes us on a powerful journey into the dreaming mind and gives us tools to try and make sense of the often confusing signs and symbols we find there. The author is respectful in understanding that a dream is a singularly personal experience, and so does not try to fit dreams into a mold. He offers keys and clues to unlocking the mystery within. His guidelines for group dream work are grounded in respect and trust for individual members of the group, for the healing nature of the work, and for the very act of exploring the subconscious."
4,"Requies Some Interpretation, But Gives Good Direction Toward Interpreting Dreams","A little long and round-about for getting to the very meaty stuff at the end.The most beneficial part is at the end where it tells you to take every emotion/verb/person/place/thing in your dream that you can remember and assign its attributive description to the words ""part of me."" So, if you dream about your father, you might try ""authoritative part of me"" and retell your dreams doing this. Cleared up some major recurring dreams for me!"
5,Braille Rook Cards,Had to get some games for a little blind girl while she went to see her Dad and thee were awesome!! First time I had bought braille toys.
2,When Sheep Attack,"So I see this movie at Blockbuster. It's got a pretty ridiculous 3-D prismatic cover that features a herd of demonic sheep and it's called ""Corn"". I couldn't resist...The tagline on the video box, ""It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature"" is borrowed from an old margarine commercial. This thing has got to be awful, right? Well, the reality is that it's not quite as bad as you might imagine. It ends up being a weird Rosemary's Baby kind of story about genetic manipulation and aggression. Not done with the same panache of 28 Days Later, it still strives for a unique story. In the end, ""When Sheep Attack"" might have been a better title, and it's pretty boring at times... but I think two stars is fair."
3,"great drill and light set, but...","Great drill and light I bought to complement the 9.6V impact I had, but the batteries attached differently.The snap-on batteries with this set lasted over a year, while the old clip-on style from impact are still going strong."
1,not what i expected,Within the picture above it shows how it forms all around the bottons on the front bottom of the phone but when i recieved it it just turned out to be a square. I am very displeased from what i thought i was ordering.
1,SteveO,"Product fell apart after eight months. Poorly made. Repair not covered under warrantee. Consider something else, there are better options.SteveO"
3,"Nice, but fragile","This clear case actually fit better than I had expected, and felt and looked rather nice. Unfortunately, it broke after the first drop onto a wood floor. I would expect an external case to be more sturdy."
5,So that's what religion is!,"Peirs Anthony's twisted way of dealing with reality yet again reaches an all time high. This time although he questions the perception of religion. For all of you out there who are bible thumping maniacs to heathens this is the book for you. Some of the content in the book is disturbing if you are not prepared but the message given is well worth hearing. Truly one of Anthony's best works. Be prepared to take some time to read it. It's worth it if you are not easily offended. It will open the eyes and expand the mind of all who read it. If you have ever taken a philosophy class and did not like the way it effected your life I suggest you steer clear of this baby, but on the otherhand if your looking for explanations and want the truth this novel is not to be missed!"
4,Always a good read. Nice to have it on Kindle.,Good insights into Dickson's Dorsai series. A good read. I'm having fun rebuilding my old paper back Dorsai collection for my Kindle. Stories read well.
5,Dorsai!,Love them all. I have read them all over the years and have enjoyed every one. The spirit and the vibrancy of the writing is something you don't see much of anymore.
2,"Okay brush, lousy scraper","I bought this while living in central New York and its accompanying blizzards. The brush was decent enough for sweeping snow off of my (compact) car, but the scraper end was mediocre at removing ice and eventually lost a corner, rendering it useless.You'd be much better off just buying a separate large brush and something like theHopkins 13014 Ice Chisel 10"" Scraperinstead."
4,Does the job,"This scraper works well. It was smaller than I had expected though. I wish it had a longer handle or an extendable one, but if you're looking for one that's small and compact, this one will work."
2,Thin frost is OK. But useless on ice.,"I have owned this snow-brush for several years. My main usage is the ice scraper part of it. For light over-night frost buildup, this tool is sufficient. But this is definitely the wrong tool for light and thin ice (not even heavy ice) buildup on the windshield. First, the front edge of the ice scraper has hard time to grap onto the light thin ice. Secondly, the plastic ice scraper can not sustain heavy scarping work. My ice scraper got broken while trying to remove some light thin ice.For think ice on the windshield, don't even think about using this tool.You pay with what you get. Now I am looking for more heavy duty ice scraper."
1,Not worth the price of shipping (even for free),"I was very dissapointed when I finally used this brush for our first snow this week. The brush sits too far back to clean the part of your side windows next to the side view mirrors without the scrapper getting in the way and constantly banging your side mirror. The bursh is too small to be effective for anything more than a dusting. The scraper is angled so that only about 1/2 of it actually hits the windows at any given time. For me, it was waste of time and money. I would not recommend this product."
2,Weak for real ice,"Flimsy construction and weak materials. Ice scraping teeth are almost separate from each other and break off easily if you try to scrape real frost/ice. Mine broke off within a week, my girlfriends within similar time frame - she eventually returned her's to a store. Recently during snow storm while driving rental, I borrowed one - handle broke off when I shook snow off it.I guess for two bucks it's OK as a cart filler, but if you need something that will hold in snowy area for at least couple of seasons, buy something sturdier and/or buy locally, so at least you can return it and stick it to manufacturer."
1,The Title is a real misnomer !,"I purchased this book hoping to get a good overview of Irish History ! About the first 100 or so pages, the author zipped through the most interesting part of the early history of Ireland....I kept wondering what could possibly fill the next 240 pages. To my chagrin, those following pages were filled with the Authors obvious hatred and hostility toward the English and the Protestant Church. Telling in this diatribe was the authors statement on page 337 that ""the catholic church has always condemned violence"", when previously on page 141, the author affirmed the fact that ""the pope declared it lawful for a catholic to assassinate a Protestant ruler.This latter 2/3 of the book was not actual history, but more often the opinions, interpretations, and inner feelings of the predjudiced authors, couched in what a prospective reader would think was history. Shame on them, and beware to a reader."
2,Cheapened failure,"I just bought a new RAS-120 angle square to replace my old RAS-120. I think my anger with the new tool is proportional to how much I liked the old one. The new square is thinner than the old one, and came from the store bent. For the savings of a few pennies Johnson ruined one of the most useful tools I own. I called Johnson and gave them an earful. To their credit it appears that they stand behind their products with a strong warranty, but frankly I'd much rather never have to use that warranty. I don't know if there is a good alternative out there, but if you are replacing your good old square don't expect a good new one to replace it."
1,The Twilight Girls,"If you're buying this video because you're looking for Catherine Deneuve, be advised that not only is she not credited, but she is so young and the part is so small, you may have to view this several times to figure out who she is. The leads in this movie are VERY melodramatic and there are mild lesbian scenes in it as well (Catherine is not in any of them). Deneuve's talent, once you figure out who she is, is very apparent even at such a young age, but again, her part is so small, you may have to put your VCR on pause, just to get a glimpse of her face."
1,anonymous,I found this movie corny and boring. There was too much censorship and little nudity. The only thing good about this film is it shows us how porn was made in the past.
4,SOS JTB?,"Like Blake sings in 'Little Light,' are the Jets drowning in melodrama? I understand that a fiercely poetic side is being shown more and more in Blake's songs, and perhaps it's the old Jawbreaker fan coming out in me, but I did not enjoy this album as much as their first. I think Blake must have been in love when he made this one; however, despite the serious and nascent mellowness that comes out in much more use of the keyboard, there are some wonderful songs--Orange Rhyming Dictionary, Your X-rays, Pale New Dawn, Mid-Day Anonymous, a few others. A new side to the Jets emerges with each song in this album, as there is no burning and raw edge like ""Morning New Disease"" on Four Cornered Night, but hey, I guess the pristine vision of the artist (Your X-rays) is always changing. A good album if you enjoy the great baritone of Blake, but for first timers, be warned--this may not be what you were expecting."
2,Where's the rock?,"Not much happen' on this disc if you liked Jawbreaker. Seems more ""emo"" than ""core""."
4,i like it better than Bivouac.,"i don't Bivouac that much, mostly cause the vocals and, well the music(don't get me wrong they are a great band but i don't really like the punk-ness of Bivouac). i do like Jawbreaker's other cd :dear you ...it's a great cd with great lyrics and everything...if you like :dear you get four cornered night or orange RD."
3,????,"I loved Orange Rhyming Dictionary... really loved it... the lyrics and music meshed and after many (many, many) listens you really got what Blake was trying to say (or you developed a better meaning for yourself). Due to the passion I felt for their first album (and for Jawbreaker albums) I was dying to hear this cd... and was disappointed. The lyrics are at times trite, the music nothing special. With additional listenings it has grown on me (at times... there are still some really bad songs). Stand out track is Orange Rhyming Dictionary, worst track is the final one (what was he thinking?). I will continue to love this, but I wonder where ""now I'm making out the shapes/ like the shower rod/ can it take my weight"" have gone..."
2,What happened?,"Orange Rhyming Dictionary was easily one of the best albums I've heard in a long time, so needless to say I was especially excited when I bought this. I feel utterly betrayed by this band. When I listen to any song on this CD, then I listen to any song on ORD (especially ""Chinatown"" or ""I Typed for Miles"") it makes me want to smack Blake and ask him what the hell he thinks he's doing. I don't recommend this album at all, but I still whole-heartedly recommend Orange Rhyming Dictionary for anyone and everyone."
3,What is Blake trying to do?,"Although I had seen the Jets play many of the new songs live, I was still highly anticipating this album. At first listen this album is terrible, the songs are not as cathcy as the last album, the lyrics are too self involved and you can't help thinking that Blake is out for revenge against Jade Tree records, for whatever reason. However, I'm not a musician and one pointed out to me how incredible the dynamics are on this album. Yes it is something very different and maybe that's what this emo-same riff-driven society needs. Maybe the Jets are trying to change their style and that's fine, but I wouldn't be surprised if they lost a few fans on the way."
2,More like Elevator (music) to Brazil,"JETS TO BRAZIL's ""Orange Rhyming Dictionary"" was one of the BEST releases of the year. I was excited to get ""Four Cornered Night"" but instead... I was devastated! JTB add another guitar player and barely use either!I was so sick that initally I didn't even enjoy the one GREAT song and the two or three so-soSongs.The GREAT song seems to be a track that didn't make the cut from the last cd (Orange Rhyming Dictionary) since the GREAT song is entitled ""Orange Rhyming Dictionary"".I have spoke with other JETS TO BRAZIL fans who love this record.I dunno.... had I been EXPECTING a laidBack album perhaps I would have enjoyed it but... damn! ....I was expecting at least a little bit of JTB's guitarAmbush."
3,at first listen,"The passion of Jawbreaker is gone. Who ever said one has to age gracefully? With the edgy drama of Orange embedded in my cerebellum, I was fully expecting the same direction. I am torn: I like being surprised, and I was, however the surprise was a much more mellow JTB than I expected. I've only listened to it 3 times, I will listen to it more since Blake's voice has never been in finer shape, and I will like it. It just doesn't have the 'scream it as your driving' quality that I came to enjoy so much with Orange."
2,Quick Read if you Like Mystery of any Sort,"A very quick read by a competent writer, but not compelling in structure or writing style. Characters are not well developed, thus pushing the reader to the edge of ""suspension of disbelief."" I found the ending to be unsatisfactory in that it was cheapened by introducing an unlikely element that, prior to the ending, had been neither hinted at nor introduced. It was an easy way out for the author. This one volume ensured the Sister Joan series will not end up on my ""to read"" list."
3,Fire and Ice,Janet Dailey is alwasy good. Fire and Ice is one of her earlier books.good reading. I love her strong male characters and her strong female charaters.
5,fire and ice,"This book is great! It brought kissing back into my life, and what a way to do it. I wish I had had a teacher like Zachary Stuart!"
3,"Okay, but probably would not buy if I had a do-over.","I like Howard Garrett's Plant books, but this one just was not that useful to me.I may keep it for reference, but not really much in it that I foresee needing to refer to."
2,A serious disappointment,"I discovered Anne McCue when I stumbled on her album ""Roll"". I was knocked out. Finally a woman who wrote intelligent songs, had a voice like an angel and, somewhat incongruously, came out with the finest electric guitar licks you've ever heard since Hendrix (you don't expect anyone with a voice like that to be producing riffs that are that raunchy). Anyway, when I discovered that she had another album out I rushed out to buy it without having heard any tracks. What a let down. Lots of forgettable songs, all interspersed with bland ""fah-lah-lahs"".Dont take my word for it. Download as many tracks as you can get your hands on and judge for yourself. I'm not saying this to be vindictive - I really believed that after ""Roll"" I'd found a major new artist and I was so looking forward to hearing this album. I'm still going to look out for her work but next time I'm going to look before I leap."
5,Everything she does is great!,I have seen her in concert and have all of her music. She is one of the more versital mucisians ever with a different sound to each album. This album is sweet and melodic.
3,wanted to like this more,"I think that if I had read this book ten years ago, I would have given it a higher rating; I really did enjoy her positive, up-beat take on size acceptance, and she was very honest about how difficult it can be.However, to be truly honest, I simply could not enjoy the clothes! At 27 years old, I don't want to look like an explosion at a crayon factory. I love that Rita Farro wears just what she likes best, but I myself would rather look stylish and sophisticated instead of clownish. Again, this is my very own personal preference - I applaud Rita for following her vision, it's just not mine.5 stars for the message, 1 star for the clothes."
1,TOO HIGH,"I have always admired Chris Whitley and have seen him live several times. But this CD...he must have owed someone some heavy money to put this thing out for sale. Take a look at the photo on the cover. It pretty much says it all. It's like some sort of bizarre Disney ride, ""You must be this high to like this album"". Sorry Chris, reload and try again."
4,faith affirming,"This was an excellent book, though admittedly, a tear jerker. It was amazing to see the strength of this child as she waged her battle and how she got closer to God through it. It is worth a read. It touched me and taught me so much that reading it once was not enough. Anyone who is a Christian or is dealing with an illness will benefit from this one."
3,"not as good as""having it and eating it""","After reading, and enjoying, ""having it and eating it"" I was anxious to read this book. However, this book was hard to get into. I didn't really feel the need to keep reading to see what happens next. The story was full of details about settings, and I don't really care for so much description. The ending was vague. I'm not really sure what the main character did at the end when presented with a situation. The ending seemed rushed to wrap everything up and in doing so left me thinking, ""huh?"""
5,Steadfast Love,"You are loved with an everlasting love. Do you know this? Does your heart ache for a love that is faithful and true... no matter what? This is the very love that God has for you! Have you messed up - again! - and feel like God couldn't possilby love you any longer? Then grab this book, and find out the truth!Debbie dives deep into the fathomless ocean of God's great and steady love, through an in-depth, yet refreshingly practical and simple, study of God's Word. Among the many other things, you will learn that God's love for you is steadfast and fixed on you. There is nothing that can separate a child of God from His everlasting love! Do this study and learn for yourself!Open this book and be prepared for your heart to find the security and confidence in a Love that will not let you go, reject you, fail you, or leave you. God is Love, and His love is steadfast."
4,"This book is in the ""comfortable range"" for most readers","A COMFORTABLE RANGE is for anyone who has ever loved an animal (or a child) and also experienced the joy of being free outdoors accompanied by that loved one.Jim's story is the perfect summer ""read,"" for one can finish it in a day at the beach or an afternoon in the sunshine at home.I think Amazon needs to broaden the way it refers people to the book. It's not just a book for hunters. It has much wider appeal than that."
2,~These Are Not The Same As They Used To BE~,These stockings are thinner and not as much compression as the Truform men's stocking in the mostly white box what happen to them I won't buy these again! :(
2,Another 'sound-alike' interpretation,"This is as uninspiring and insipid as it can get. Quite similar to Schiff's WTC - mechanical and boring. I suggest GouldThe Glenn Gould Edition - Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book IThe Glenn Gould Edition - Bach: The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book II, NikolayevaBach - Well Tempered Clavier - Tatiana Nikolayeva (4 CD Set), RichterBach: Well-Tempered Clavier, Feinberg The Art of Samuel Feinberg Vol 1.Bach: Well-Tempered Clavier. Book 1 & 2 (3 cd set). as more satisfying interpreters."
2,"Arrived defective, bad customer service","I was disappointed to hear from my girlfriend that the guitar stand I got her arrived defective. When I contacted the people at Austin Bazar they were less than accomodating and wouldn't send me a little plastic height adjustment part that was in bunch of little pieces. They kept repeating how the return/exchange policy was past the period allowed. I explained to them my intention was not to return or exchange the stand, I just wanted the part. They wouldn't budge. Oh well, I guess their policy is not to keep their customers happy. So, with that, if you decide to order one of these Laurel Guitar stands just hope and pray it arrives without defect. Good Luck."
3,Sturdy?,"This guitar stand is sturdy enough to hold an acoustic guitar.Only.The stand itself is much lighter than the acoustic guitar which makes it a little wobbly. But,all in all, its a great product. Its useful if you just need to set your guitar down while at a concert.I don't recommend this for anything heavier than an acoustic."
4,Good basic guitar stand.,Got this stand for a beginner guitar. Everything works fine and the stand is sturdy. It holds the small guitar well and should work for a full size guitar as well. My only disappointment is that the stand seems to close up a bit when the stand is shifted. I would prefer that it lock into place a little better for my young guitar player.
4,good economical guitar stand,"for the price this is a good stand, it holds my guitar well. I especially like the price, but had to wait three weeks to get it."
3,Good but over priced,It is a great stand and I don't regret buying it but for my second guitar I found the exact same thing for 3/4 the price and no shipping at a local store. Buy it just not here.
3,Visually appealing but outdated,"I looked at this map at a fantastic store that only sells maps. Visually, this map looks great. It provides a great deal of detail and outlines all the Society Islands. The problem? It clearly is outdated. For example, looking at the section on Bora Bora, it provides the locations of hotels that have not been there for years (such as the nonexistent Hyatt). This map might be useful for driving but I would question its accuracy."
4,A decent collection of stories.,"I had read ""The Gold at the Starbow's End"" before, but enjoyed it quite a bit both times. The least enjoyable story, I found, was the last, ""Thus Love Betrays Us."" I really did not understand it at all.Usually I do a more thorough review of short story collections, making a comment about each of the stories, but this was my purse book, which means I carry it around to read in waiting rooms and the like. I started it last September, so I don't really remember many details. I think that might say something, though; that possibly these stories aren't terribly memorable."
3,For poets only,"Koja has a command of language not generally found except by poets. If you love action/adventure stay away from this book. However, if you love to feel words on a visceral level and experience a new world from inside the head of new characters, try this book. Although dark, it touches on a primal level."
5,Sad & Beautiful,"Excellent writing. It's the first book I've read by Kathe Koja, but she's made a new fan.Dark and strange, I would recommend this to everyone."
5,A Great Novel!,"Perhaps Kathe Koja is misplaced in the genre horror and therefore is misunderstood by the reviewers and some readers. This book is contemporary fiction. It is one of those rare books wherein the characters stayed with me not only all day, but for many years past reading. In my first reading I was concerned about them and could not wait to get home to the book to be with them. Now almost ten years past reading the images of these Strange Angels are with me as clear as the first time I encountered them. Ultimately this book is a true tragic novel, in line with the best contempory fiction and classics. Had Dostoevsky knew modern psycharity he may have written this book."
2,A very slow read,"The title is at least half right. This book is strange but not in the least bit interesting. In fact, there isn't anything in this book remotely scary. It reads like a regular fiction novel. I agree with other reviews on this book: if you're looking for action, then you've picked up the wrong book."
1,horrible!,"A waste of time. It is a hard read, the words do not flow. It was work to finish it, but I always finish a book I start. Also, the word viscous is way over used. It seems the author liked the word and used it as much as possible. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,I CAN SEE AGAIN!,I bought this square because I couldn't read the old plain aluminum square I had indoors in the poor lighting of the jobsite. The contrast of the white numbering and the black body is great! I don't have to strain to see things. Only four stars because the paint on the leg with the 12th's scale was slightly smudged.
4,Two Classic Albums from The Amazing Rhythm Aces: Stacked Deck/Too Stuffed to Jump,"Finally found the ""Too Stuffed to Jump"" Album! Doesn't sound quite as great as I remember the old album did, but glad to have it again :)"
5,AT Last--- Reissue of the year!,"I have orderd this cd already and cant wait to have it my hand, so in the meantime I'll tell you what I think. This are not only the best two albums by this band released in the 70's, but some of the best country-music ever done. Forget the Eagles, Poco, The Byrds, Firefall, whatever, if they didnt make the big league blame the wind, this was an accident, their music holds better than any other from the 70's. If you've heard about the Amazing and want to know where to start, start here. This is the reissue of the year!"
5,Great,This shampoo and conditioner are the best I have used. Used to buy at whole foods but they no longer carry it in stock. I was please to see I could order it on amazon and at a better price than whole foods. This shampoo and conditioner leaves my fine hair soft and full of body.
5,awesome silver conditioner works for many hair types,"I have thick coarse Asian hair. My boyfriend has fine soft Caucasian hair. So my hair feels like a horse's mane, and his feels like bunny fur.This conditioner works awesome for both of us! It makes my hair softer and straighter. It makes his hair less likely to poof up or get messy. It has these positive effects right away after the first use.Not to mention, it has a great scent that is gender-neutral.Finally, it is the coolest color. It's silver. It looks like liquid metal. How cool is that!"
3,Worked well on chemically treated hair.,"I liked this conditioner on my rebonded hair. Even while my roots were growing out, it seems to work well. Although now I have switched to Bed Head but I think it's worth buying for someone with thick, frizzy and out of control hair."
2,A Surprise for Windham Hill Fans,"We love holiday music (more than 100 titles in our collection), and particularly enjoy quiet music you can have on in the background any time of day. We love Jim Brickman, and bought the CD thinking it would be FAB-U. It was not. This is one that we just pick and choose select cuts for our collection."
2,very basic and a little boring,I am abig fan of the LS tapes and do from 2-5 miles everyday. This tape is a true BEGINNERS TAPE so if you have walked with Leslie at all this isn't for you. The tape is in 3 sections 10 minutes each and the only one that is up to speed is the 3rd brisk walk with weights.There is too much repition of side steps and very little variation BORING!!!!Skip this one. It was made for th JEnny Craig progrma and was to introduce people to fitness. So all I can say is if you haven't gotten off the couch in a while or ever and want to start. This is a good beginning.
3,One out of Two ant' bad,"Let me just say that this CD is worth the price for ""Back in Town"" alone. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars and not 5 is that ""Something Special"" is really not. The song selectons are not the best--and they--to me anyway--are OVER produced. The Kingston Trio were always best in their 'rawist' form,ie live--in concert or in the studio--no strings, no backup vocals."
3,Something Missing!,"This CD version is not totally the version I purchased as a 33 and a third long playing vinyl in 1964. Two, or even three songs have been changed, causing a loss of quality the original orchestral backed group produced on vinyl."
4,good time music,kick back and enjoy both the music and the memories! that's what i do with the kingston trio cd's from amazon. a great addition to my library and just the boost i needed.
5,cats love them,"My cats love these, and you need to get more than one they go missing fast, but in a few days the cats are chasing them down the hall again, dug out from where ever they stuffed them. Also if you have a cat with white feet, they'll have green feet from licking the ball like a Tootsie Pop."
5,Alternative Source for a similar product,"You can purchase the ENTIRE Bible (New International Version/Novo Versao Internacional) at www.livrariasaraiva.com.brI don't know how long it will take to ship it from Brazil, but it is quite reasonably priced."
5,LOOKING FOR THIS BOOK,HelloI'm looking for this book or any Bilingual Portuguese/English bible. Also I'm seeking a Bilingual Italian/English version. I would greatly thank anyone who could help me..John A Donnarumma Jr. ph# 781-286-5754/ 617-285-3995
5,And then he snapped,"Very faithful adaptation of Saul Bellow's novel, with Robin Williams in the lead role as Tommy Wilhelm, a 40-year-old man down and out on his luck and howling at the world because of it. Williams lets out all the stops and creates a harrowing and harried character who loses all hope. A powerful picture."
4,MY REVIEW FOR THIS MOVIE,"""DEAD POET SOCIETY"" I like this movie, because I was moved by it. Perhaps, this movie tells us that you don't have to obey your parents and try to be honest to yourself and live anything you like!! In this film, all children obey their parents. The school the children go to is very strict. One day a teacher named Mr.Keating came to school. Mr Keating is a free-thinker. Because of his appearence,children's thinking is changing day by day. In this film, my favorite charactor is Mr Keating,because he always smiling and I like his way of thinking. The most impressive scene for me is when Mr.Keating leaves the school and students stand up on their desks and say, ""Oh, Chaptain my chaptain"" I couldn't control myself and moved into tears.At last, I think this film is worth seeing very much , please rent this film and watch it!!"
4,Short but deep,"Don't be fooled. A short book doesn't mean a lack of information between the covers. The author gives us an excellent treatment of ten seconds of thought about periods in the main characters life. This was selected by my book club, and I was reluctant at first, then pleasantly surprised. Well done!"
4,regrooving is soooo fine!,"another sharp and powerful album by patty larkin. this one strikes me as slightly more composed, with a quiet restraint- similiar in feeling to pershiable fruits. what it reminds me of is someone whispering to my ear, or reading me a story at night- private, complicit conversations. the songwriting is great- i think sparser - with a quality like litany- listings and repetitions of thoughts and phrases that give a mood and insistent to the work. the guitar work is patty as ususual- amazing - and the production is just surprising at times- those horns! i wont say more."
1,SAVE YOUR $$,Patty! Say it isn't so! This album is a complete mess! You'll be better off spending your money on Angels Running or Stranger's World.
5,Shakespearian Surrealism,"Writing in a mercilessly strict form, Berryman managed to create a sense of flux that mirrors the chaos of what we today call ""mental illness."" The Songs draw heavily from Freudian psychoanalysis and are essentially the free associative ramblings of the protagonist Henry House, whose father killed himself when Henry was a child, who battles alcoholism, runaway libido, inferiority complexes, grief over the recent deaths of friends. Reading Berryman reminds me of what Bernstein said about Beethoven. Beethoven wasn't known for great melody, wasn't a master orchestrator, did not innovate harmony, but somehow someway knew the exact right note that should come next. Berryman is that way for me."
5,Number 29,I just went back over a few of the poems in this book. Everything I chanced to read was brilliant but not so memorable. But then I came across Number 29 again. I'd forgotten. There is nothing like #29.
5,Don't be put off,"Don't be put off. It daunts one at first. Flip through till you find the right one, then skip around. There are gems in here, and the more you keep looking, the more you find. Trite as that may be to say, there are rich rewards here"
3,Good product but came with a chip in it,"By the reviews this product got I thought it would be extravagant. I ordered it for my grandma because she eats bread like it's her day job and she hates crumbs with a passion. When I got the product the plastic that encased it was half ripped off so I ripped the rest of it off and lifted up the tray and noticed the one corner was completely chipped off and the tiny pin nail holding it together was exposed and wobbly, there was also another split on an opposite side where the nail was not carefully shot through. Decent construction and I'm sure she will get use out of it for a while and love it, grandmas love everything."
4,It catches the crumbes.,"It works like it should. Easy to clean.It could be bigger for the price., even though I looked for cheaper but could not find."
1,The board was broken on arrival.,"The trivet part of the board seems well made, but the crumb tray part was completely broken into its component parts, on arrival. I couldn't see that they had used any glue to attach the base to the sides. There was some evidence of glue where the sides should have been attached at the corners, but there the wood was broken. The base seems very weak - far too weak to make an effective tray.I make my own bread, and the crust can be quite tough. I don't think this board would have stood up to the beating it would get, even if it had been glued properly.Quite disappointed, because this item didn't get any bad reviews. I wonder if the manufacturer has changed or if I got an ususually bad piece.Since I'm returning this and not planning to try to get another the same, I would have given 0 stars if I could."
5,Mountain Woods Multi-purpose cutting board/crumb tray,"Definately get what you pay for, I take quality anyday, expect to use this for many years to come. fine craftsmanship went into this work of wood/art. Love it, its functional and beautiful used as a cooling rack, cutting board and crumb catcher ... sweet deal. Goes great with the bread knife made by the same company. Hoorah, for American woodworkers ..."
3,Disappointed,"Loved the look of the crumb tray, it seemed to be constructed pretty good except for the laun, the plywood veneerthat they used for the tray. It is peeling in several places. I wanted a replacement but the only option was a refund.Sadly I am returning the crumb tray."
3,works well but some warping,"I've had this product for a few months now. It is nicely constructed and works well. However, some of the top slats have warped slightly, so the cutting surface is no longer even. Occasionally this makes it hard to completely cut through the bread at the bottom."
5,Great Kitchen Helper!,"I've been using this bread board in my kitchen for years. For all the other neatnics out there, it's the perfect solution. I entertain a lot and every time I use this board, my friends ask where they can get one. I've looked around in local kitchen supply stores and no one seems to be carrying it any more. So when I found it online, I ordered 3 more for Christmas gifts. My friends will be thrilled!Mountain Woods Multi-Purpose Cutting Board and Crumb Tray"
2,Love It!!,I bought this tray for myself a few months ago and absolutely love it. No more messy breadcrumbs all over the place. I am ordering another one to send to my in laws in Belgium. I know they will appreciate this as much as I do.
4,"A Truly Wonderful, Overlooked Album","Lost Luggage was an opener for the Gin Blossoms on their first national tour of small clubs in 1992 (along with Crash Vegas). The band played an astonishing, earnest, powerful set, and this recording captures some of that magic, admittedly in a crudely recorded fashion. Lost Luggage, whoever they are, wherever they came from, made music that rivaled that of sincere-minded '90s college-rock bands like Buffalo Tom, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Soul Asylum, Live, and The Connells. Probably the field was too crowded at that time to emerge as a commercially viable act (See also Squirrels, Four.) But this is a charming, impressive recording, nonetheless.This album is now hard to find but is worth repeated listens if not full ownership. The sound and style are certainly dated now, but in a warm, nostalgia-inducing way. I own it and still listen to it from time to time and never tire of it.Awesome tracks: On the Ropes, Front Porch, Storyline, and Roller Coaster."
4,Interesting book,"I like this book, because has a lot of thought into design aspect. You need to read it."
1,A piece of junk,"This is the 2nd Sportline stopwatch I have gotten. The first worked for a little while but the buttons were quite temperamental; in other words, sometimes they worked, sometimes they did not. The second one only worked a few times before the start/stop button became impossible to push. Don't waste your money on this; instead, spend a little more on a better one."
1,Useless,"Same problem as others. Buttons don't work reliably. I use them to time at swim meets, and tried swapping one for another, but they're all crap."
2,very hard to use the button functionality...,"ultimately a very frustrating product to use... just wanted a reliable, not too expensive stopwatch to time sprints. the commands for the three buttons are confusing (comes with an user manual) and it is difficult to get the buttons to respond the way the manual says they will to activate different modes / use different functions. the stopwatch also has a clock / alarm function, which I did not need -- and somehow the buttons to activate the alarm would get pushed in my sports bag, making the alarm go off at inopportune times in my sports bag, while hanging on a door at home, etc. -- and then it would be difficult to figure out how to disable the alarm.... there must be better products out there than this.... the only silver lining - when I could successfully get the stopwatch into timing mode, it seemed to work well / accurately. never could figure out how to use more complex functions that it supposedly can do, like splits, two competitors, etc."
1,Horrible. Please don't waste your time or money. You will regret.,"With the first one of these when I pressed the start/stop button it would not engage/acknowledge such (ie. timer would not start, or if already started, would not stop). So, I'd press it repeatedly and it would work sometimes.So, I returned it and tried another one. The second one was EVEN WORSE! The first one worked for about a month. The second didn't even last a week before it started doing this same thing even worse than the first. Waste of time, money, and thumb energy."
1,Don't buy this!,I use this stopwatch once a day. Within a week the buttons do not respond and you have to push them numerous times before they will respond. It is extremely frustrating. Find another stopwatch to buy.
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this stop watch and for about ten minutes it did exactly what I needed it to do: start, stop and reset. Nothing fancy. Then I had to push the button several times to get it to start and several more to get it to stop. Which makes it worthless. The next day it wouldn't start at all. Unfortunately I bought it on the way out of town but I will be returning it as soon as I get home. I stopped into a sporting goods store when I got where I was going and the clerk told me that all he had was that same stop watch and he didn't recommend that I buy it. That tells me all I need to know."
5,Cantainer Drink Holder,This is a very nice holder. Mounts easily to my handlebar and doesn't slip around when I put a drink in it. I like the removable foam liner to let me carry larger bottles. I have also used it for carrying my housekeys and cellphone. Well made.
2,Kind of disappointed,"I have a Denali jacket that I LOVE and have been wearing it all the time for the past 2 years (can wear 3 seasons in New England!)...that's why I decided to purchase another one. Buyers be aware that the new Denali jackets are ""recycled"" materials. If you had an old version, you will notice the difference...if not...maybe not? The jacket seems ""cheaper"" and not as plush, thick, soft, or warm. I wasn't sure if it was a defect or a fake or what? But, it has all the North Face tags. This was my favorite jacket and it is unfortunate that they cheezed out on it. I will not purchase another."
3,Not as warm as expected,"I live in the Cleveland area and our winters can get very harsh. I was excited to finally by a Denali North Face jacket because I had heard so many good things about them and everyone around me had them. I was disappointed the first time I wore it out and realized that it was not much warmer then a thin hooded sweatshirt. I bought the black and grey one in an x-small and probably should have gotten a small because it seems to run small in size. The fleece does not really wash well and attracts lint. Overall not too impressed, especially for the price."
1,wooow,"I open the package.It smells terrible.I try it on....it is not what i expected for a jacket that goes for over $100 in North Face stores.I thought it'd be amazing and the warmest jacket I own as everyone rants and raves.Thinner than authentic jackets.Tags are real, but I researched this and one thing that commonly happens is when factories get the design, they make authentic ones, but at night when most go home, some untrustworthy people make the same ones using cheap, non-authentic materials and that's what we call FAKE. Which was exactly what mine was. Very upset :/Wont be buying brand name things online anymore.Not trustworthy."
4,The Capture,"The capture is a story that captured me in many ways. It is a tale of a young orphaned owl trying to keep his memorys alive and trying to survive on his own in an orphanage. Othough feeling very alone is not being completely alone, he meets many new people along the way which help him discover himself and the mysteries of his past.In many ways i don't like these sob stories of some thing or person tries to find them selves in a world of many. But as i read on i found that it was not just a sad sob story but a story of mystery and betrayl and i recommend it to all ages and types of readers everywhere. I just hope i=this is published in japanese!!!!!! =)"
2,morbid & depressing. not for us!,"there's a lot of interesting owl factiods here, and we did watch the movie which was done fabulously, but the depth of darkness that shrouds this whole read is too much for my little ones, i think. they'll get thier share of morbidity as they grow older, i think this novel would be awesome if the tone was a little lighter."
5,It's Great,If you are looking for a book that is fiction but has true facts in it well here is a book for you. This book is about a young owl named Soren he is well captured by a mean (moon blinked) owl (you will learn about moon blinked in the book.) He is taken to a dreadful place that.I will not name see what happens in this of mystery and fun.
5,Great book,"This is a great book. The main character is Soren, a Barn Owl. I don't want to say too much and ruin the book for you, so let's just say it's wonderful. If you like owls, this is the book for you. It might be a bit sad, though."
4,if you didn't really like the first book still read the series,i read this book when i was 10 and i couldn't get into it then i decided to give it another go when i was 11 and i liked the book the problem is with this book is it isn't necessarily bad but not the best either if you read the first book and didn't like it still read the series it gets better trust me
5,A Fantastic Story,"The Guardians of Ga'hoole, #1 The Capture is a great book. It has some interesting facts about owls. And the story is fantastic!This book is about Soren (a barn owl), who gets captured and taken to a group of evil owls, who call themselves St. Aggie's Academy for Orphan Owls. There he meets an elf owl named Gylfie, and together with help from some friends they will try to escape.Then starts a thrilling adventure that young readers will love and will want to read again and again.Claire L., age 9"
5,Guardians of Ga'Hoole #1,THIS BOOK IS AMAZING. I bought it after the movie became my instant favorite. The book is very well written and I could not put it down. Excellent read.
3,From a parent,"I have now read 12 of the 15 books in this series out loud to my 7 (now 8) year old son. He loves them, which is why we've kept on going. I give it only 3 stars. The prose is ponderous and repetitive, which is especially obvious when the books are read out loud. I'll continue to plod through to the end of Book 15, but I'm really looking forward to moving on to something else when we're done with this series."
4,Deffinatley worth a shot,"The Capture, first text of the Gaurdians of Ga'hoole series, does just what the title suggests.It captures the reader into the story leaving them hanging onto every sentence. Even though a book that is targeted at the juvenile audience, it has the complexity and depth to keep the attention of an adult reader.The book is relatively short with a little over 200 pages but this is enough to begin a well thought out plot line that gives rise to 14 additional books to the series. This come highly recommended to adult's with children looking for a reading adventure to take along with their little one or even those looking for an enjoyable quick read."
5,gurdians of ga'hoole,This book is great I could hardly stop reading until I was finished. I even gave up videogames
4,little did i know that when i picked up the capture i was about to read the best series ever written.........,"this was a really good book after i read it i started talking like the owls in the book i kept on saying yoicks and racdrops and some of the other owl words my favorite book in the series was the hatching my favorite characters are nyroc/coryn, digger, ruby, ezylryb ,theo and i sort of like nyra and kludd i hope this review helped if you don't mind please leave me a comment thank you"
2,Save your Time and Money,"When I read this book something about it made my brain say,"" Step away from the book!""But I read on hoping it would get better but it didn't. If you want agood book I'd recomend Warriors.it is like this book but better."
2,Are we that immune to cruel acts?,"I've only read to chapter 10, about 35% of the through the book and I cannot help but be astounded that this is considered a book suitable for children. I am an adult and the cruel and violent actions dipicted in these first 9 chapters have me completely tied in knots and very upset. Some of the reviews from those that liked the book seem to ignore the violence altogether.It is interesting to me that the few folks who gave the book an unfavorable review did so on the grounds that it was boring. I hardly think that plucking the wing feathers from a three week old chick is boring. I find it quite disturbing.My next action will be to delete it from my Kindle. It is not something I would ever recommend to a young person and I would not even want my adult daughter to read it. I can only hope that the rest of the series is not so indifferent to cruel acts because that is not a message I would want to send to a child."
2,The Owl Version of 1984,"Owl eggs and babies are kidnapped and brought to a cruel and frightening place run by dictator-type owls...need I say more? Very disturbing book, actually - certainly not for younger children."
1,Bad Book,"This book is one I would NOT recommend to anyone!Horrible, truly Horrible. The plot makes no sense. And having a Brain-washing orphanage was a really bad idea. Nothing about this book was interesting or worth spending money on. Shame on who ever the author is.Don't read this book.Spottedstream Riverclan"
3,for diferent readers,"kathyrine has definite talent and my respect, the book is well written and has great dialouge. Unfournanatley its a little to dark for me. Soren, the main character, is constantly repremanded, scoffed at, abused and finally thrown out of the nest by his older brother Kludd. Kludd denies having anything to do with sorens dissaperance, but the next night, he does the same to his sister egglantine. For me, all of this is a little to dark. I gave it three stars because, like I said before, kathyrine has definite talent. For the right reader, this could be a great book. If your not into all the darkness and gore, dont buy it."
1,It was so boring I didn't read the whole thing,"I got this book since it was suppossed to be good. I finished the first chapter and saw that it was so boring. Then I skipped ahead to the end to see if it was any good. Sometimes a book can be boring in the first part, but as it goes on it gets better. That was not the case with this book! The characters had no substance and were just stupid and uninteresting. The story was boring and uninteresting also. I would have given it 0 stars, but that was not an option."
5,UNIDEN BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Uniden,This replacement battery lasted longer than any substitute I bought previously. I would recommend this battery over a generic battery.
4,Does the job.,"Keeps my old walk around phones working. When I think my phone is too old, I just get another battery. About every 18-24 months. Handy to get online."
1,Mine were duds,"It seems that these come from a lot of factories, and there's no easy way for a buyer to tell what's good. Mine lasted just a few minutes' talk time on full charge, and were returned."
3,two out of three,"Bought three, only two of them are keeping a charge (ask to have them tested before you purchased the product)"
2,batteries,"UNIDEN BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for UnidenVery good price bargin, but only lasted two weeks, was hoping for better.Guess might as well pay higher price at store,at least they last longer."
3,"ordered 4, 3 worked","Ordered 4 3 worked.Not happy, had to go to the store and get the last one, that was not easy."
1,I never received the battery,I really needed this type of battery. I order one per of them once and never arrive. So I order them again and fortunately they did. some how I wonder if I could recover the first per of battery that I ordered.
5,functional accessory,"This little gadget enables me to expand my two USB laptop connections to four, a convenience."
2,"Bought 4, one doesn't work. Now what?",How is defective product handled? The problem follows the battery when moved to another phone. Will this result in a retailer looking to correct a bad situation?
3,Meets expectation,Quick shipping and product as specified. But the charge doesn't last at all. A fully charged battery powers only 30 minutes of calls.
1,Not by Uniden ! Appear to be fake !,"I ordered three batteries since the byline says ""by Uniden"" : ""Uniden BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Uniden by Uniden"". What I received says ""Uniden BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Uniden"". The labelling on the batteries is printed on a stuck-on paper label, and each battery pack is packaged in a Saran-Wrap type of material. These batteries appear to be fake.I had ordered two BT-446 batteries in the previous week which were sold by a different Seller. I am totally satisfied with them.. had printing diredtly on the shrink-wrapped plastic encasing the battery pack, and each battery pack was packaged in a sealed static-free plastic bag."
5,Same as new,"This replacement battery was perfect, same as a new one. Snapped in place and holding a charge like brand new equipment."
2,Uniden battery is so-so,The BT-466 cordless phone battery is the manufacturer stated replacement battery. I replaced the batteries in our four cordless phone after a couple of years in service. The BT-466 di recharge fully but would lose that charge if left out of the phone cradle overnight.
1,Not any better than the worn out battery,"This battery did say BT-446 on it and it was a tight fit into the phone. I charged it per the directions and it doesn't hold a charge much better than the dying original battery in my Uniden. The original battery was 5 years old and would last for hours of talking up till recently. On the new battery, I talked 25 min. and left it off the charger for 12 hours and it was down to 1 bar on the battery! This was on Amazon Prime and the seller was listed as Global Essentials."
1,Battery dies quickly,"The battery that arrived is smaller than the original. I personally wouldn't care that it was smaller if it worked. But it can't hold a charge, and I get the ""Battery Low"" signal after just a couple of minutes talking on the phone, even if it appears fully charged when I begin the conversation."
1,Piece of junk,"Bought these in Jan 2011. By June, one only operates for about 5 minutes, the other for maybe 15. Would not recommend purchasing this battery."
5,replaced battery rather than purchase new phone,"Since we were very happy with the quality of our phones and notinterested in replacing them, this battery was a very inexpensiveway of extending the life of our phones. We are back to gettingmany hours of talk time as well as quality sound with this easy toreplace battery."
1,Useless 5 weeks after purchase,"I ordered this battery to replace the original one, which served me well for at least two or three years. On arrival it held power for a couple of hours, maybe longer. Now, only 5 weeks later - conveniently, just past the return deadline - it is performing worse than the old battery it replaced. I read other reviews with similar complaints and ignored them; obviously a mistake. I don't know whether this battery is ""real"" or ""fake"", but the retailer should be ashamed of continuing to sell it despite being alerted by customers about this problem."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BATTERY!!!!!,"I purchased three of these batteries in August for my cordless phones, and by October, 2 of the 3 no longer will hold a charge. Funny that they lasted just long enough that they are beyond the return date, isn't it? I'm hoping that the third one will hold out long enough for me to replace them, but I sure won't be buying this brand again."
3,"They work, but do not last.","What do you need? It's a battery. The original only lasted about 1.5 years. Not too good if you ask me. I decided to go with the original battery again. They hold a charge really well, but simultaneously died on my at about the same time. (My phone has a base and a satellite phone as well. I was not as diligent as I should have been with regards to keeping phone on charger when not in use. So far, the new batteries I am using are working great. Time will tell how they will last."
5,Super product great price,After 5 years the old batteries finally started to give out. We have five headsets all using the same batteries and wanted a standard Uniden replacement. We received five replacement Uniden branded batteries at a great price and fast delivery of our order. It took just a few minutes to replace the batteries and are ready again for five years of service from these headsets.
2,NOT ORIGINAL UNIDEN !,"Although it looks in the photograph as the same battery as the one that came with the Uniden telephone (DCT-648, DCX-640 etc.) it is not! This battery is smaller and it does not even fill the battery cavity in the phone. On this battery, it still writes BT-446800mAh (same capacity as the original longer battery) but I doubt that this is it's true capacity. For the money it is not a bad deal but the claim that this is a Uniden battery is false. Just because a battery writes BT-446 it does not mean it is original. I've have a green and a black one same size as the original white battery and they also said BT-446 on them. If you need the performance of the original battery look for the Energizer ERP512GRN."
5,they work well,"I have used these batteries in my eight uniden cordless phones for several months now, and they seem to last as well while I am talking as the original batteries that came with the phones did. So far they seem like a really good deal."
5,good,Timely and worked perfect. The instructions were simple. They charged quickly and I have not had any problem with them.
4,It actually keeps a charge!,"I have 2 phones. 1 of the batteries does not retain a charge for more than 12 hours before dying. Took a shot due to the low price, otherwise I would have to buy a new cordless phone system (only 1 phone in the house is a pain). I charged it for 48 hours, took it off the power cradle. Suprisingly it held its charge for about 3 or 4 days before i needed to charge again. My good battery phone lasts for about 5 to 6 days. Please note that the battery is a bit smaller in size than my original. Did not effect putting the battery in the compartment. I have now had if for about 3 weeks. I will update if it starts losing its charge quicker."
2,Far from OEM quality,"You'd think that OEM and generic replacement batteries would come from the same few major manufacturers and be comparable in quality. Not so. I've had a set of Uniden phones for seven years. The OEM batteries saw me through 4-5 years. These aftermarket units have an MTBF of less than two years so I'm starting on my third set of replacements, which this time will be of a different make. If you can get a guarantee that you're getting the same batteries that Uniden was putting in their phones in 2005, go for it and pay twice the price if you have to. Otherwise, or if you're too cheap to look for quality, you may want to lower your expectations and understand that you're getting an 18-month battery."
1,Does NOT hold a Charge,"For 2 weeks I have had these ""Sony"" batteries in 2 Uniden Cordless Phones and once charged for 24 hours, they die after a few hours out of the charger and after only a few minutes in use. The old used batteries lasted longer.I plan to request a return for replacement, refund or exchange for a different set."
1,WARNING - not a Uniden product,"I read all the reviews and decided to do a test for myself. I ordered one BT-446 sold by Westronics (fulfilled by Amazon). And I ordered a BT-446 sold by Amazon itself. According to Amazon this is the same product and they share the same product page. The Amazon one was about twice as expensive. Even though I placed 2 separate orders (1 minute apart) they both arrived in the same box.The one from Amazon is a real Uniden BT-446.The one from Westronics is a fake! It has a sticker on it to make it look like a Uniden BT-446. It is physically smaller than the real BT-446.Amazon needs to do something about all the fakes it sells through its fulfillment of vendors. I had something similar happen to me with some iPhone charging cables. Amazon, this makes YOU look bad because it is you who are selling these items as real, even though you technically are just fulfilling for a vendor. It is your reputation on the line. It is starting to feel like eBay on Amazon."
1,NOT 'by Uniden'! False advertising!,"The title on this currently says:UNIDEN BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Unidenby UnidenOne would infer from this that these are Uniden batteries. THEY ARE NOT. They are generic, and as it turns out, the same exact type (manufacturer) as the batteries I am replacing that failed prematurely.When I bought these a few days ago, they were $6.49 each. There were cheaper batteries available, but I was willing to pay more for a Uniden battery. Today I see the price has dropped to $3.01.I bought three of these, and feel totally ripped off. I believe Amazon should set up some stricter guidelines regarding advertising descriptions to cut down on the misleading advertising going on here, which runs rampant.Not happy. I'll be leaving a negative review for the seller of my item, Global Essentials Inc."
1,i bought it from amazon and it's not oem!,"i bought this amazon prime thinking that would mean it was a genuine, oem, uniden battery. silly me. it can say ""prime"" and you can click ""1-click"" but that doesn't mean you get ""UNIDEN BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Uniden by Uniden."" you get a battery that has NO INDICATION THAT IS A UNIDEN OEM BATTERY. don't be fooled. don't believe what the web page says."
4,battery,works good on my phones will know more about product if it last 5 years as the first ones did
2,Battery would not hold a charge,"I'm not sure if the battery was used or not. I ordered 2. One held a charge and is working well, the other would not hold a charge. Because of the low cost I would not take the time to return it if that was even possible"
5,Batteries made my phones like new again!,"I went out and purchased an entire new phone system when my phone batteries would no longer hold a charge. I assumed that it would be too expensive to purchase 3 new batteries. To my surprise, I purchased 3 Uniden Brand batteries for a little over $20. They work perfect again!"
1,Died within 5 months,I purchased 2 of these batteries and initially experienced much less battery life than the original batteries around 1 hr talk and after a few months 30 min then 10min and now nothing phone will not even answer a call after sitting on the charger overnight.
2,"Not what I expected, NOT BYD, GPI!","I ordered this from Amazon as the seller because a user by the name of Pressure-Pot posted an image and stated he/she received the battery sold by Amazon and it is manufactured by BYD. BYD is the manufacturer of the batteries that are in my Uniden phones. When I received the battery from Amazon, I was disappointed to find the label stated manufactured by GPI, a lower quality third party manufacturer. So off to Amazon it goes back. I just want to let others know too in case they are looking for one made by BYD, don't go by the image. Amazon may have changed suppliers for the batteries."
3,One of four failed,"The products were delivered as expected. Two were installed and placed for charging immediately. After about two weeks the one phone still would not hold a charge. I thought it might be the phone, but since I still had two new batteries, I replaced the battery a second time. The second battery seems to be holding a charge. So one of the four batteries failed immediately. Because of the low cost of the battery I did not pursue replacement."
2,Total gimmick!!,"I'm sorry, but I have to be the naysayer when it comes to these knives. The television ad claims that these knives never require sharpening, and that is simply not true. Yes, the knives were super sharp out of the box but after about a dozen uses they became completely dull. And don't even try to argue this point with Miracle Blade because their customer service base is practically non-existent, even though these knives are supposed to be guaranteed for life. All I got from this deal were empty promises and dull knives. If you truly want nice knives but don't want to spend a fortune on good German or Japanese steel, then I recommend you try out Forschner Victorinox products. They are very reasonably priced and are excellent products that should last you many, many years. Don't be seduced by the gimmick of Miracle Blade. The low cost of these knives today will not justify the replacement cost of new knives later."
4,3 and a half stars,"I liked that this was a fast-paced book and wasn't too wordy, however, the too-subtle romance still made it a little bland. Also, there were a number of grammatical errors! Am I the only one who caught that? Spelling mistakes, typos, punctuation errors, or lack there of. I also agree about the heroine not being as good as she claimed. Then again I also thought she was a little haughty anyway. I'm not sure what the title has to do with the story either. It's not as if she suddenly discovers she's of royal blood or anything. The ""mystery"" actually became interesting toward the end, but I don't read for mystery, I read for romance. And there really wasn't much of one here."
3,Not what I expected from Elizabeth Thornton,"The story is well-written, but I quickly lost interest when it turned out that the romance is almost secondary, and not very believable. Also, sensuality wise I would rate it 4 (on a scale of 1 to 10!).I liked books like Dangerous to Kiss far far better..."
3,the second half could have been better,"I really do appreciate her work, but Thornton has a habit of having her protagonists declare their love mid-way through the novel, leaving the reader with the ultimate romance question answered but still having to wade through a quagmire of roadblocks thrown into the lovers' path.This makes the last half of her novels difficult for me to read. I find myself skipping large chunks of copy dealing with the hero and heroine to get back to the unresolved portion of the story - the mystery (or, in this case, the hunt for the villain).I would prefer for all of these issues to be resolved in close proximity to keep both plot lines equally interesting.However Thornton does weave an interesting tale for her villain as well as the hero and heroine (although the hero's past is left largely untouched). She also manages to inject the story with a good deal of social commentary on the issues surrounding the era (and domestic violence, which sadly continues to this day)."
3,Enjoyable and unique story,"The story is as follows: Case Devere, earl, gorgeous and special branch investigator comes across Jane Mayberry, quiet, unassuming beauty with a hidden past.The hidden past was worked into the storyline very well, which I have come to expect from Ms. Thornton, however the heroine let me down quite a few times during the escapades.There were also one or two plot twists here and there, that pushed the limits of credulity.The romance was there but a little forced, I felt.I do love the way Ms. Thornton writes and her command of the english language as well as her ability to re-create persons of the 19th centruy in England is fabulous. This was for me, not her best effort and I would recommend a number of her other books before this one, such as Shady Lady."
5,Excellent book for starting a Texas business,"If you're thinking about starting a business in Texas, this book is perfect for you. It covers general issues like what type of business should you start (Sole Proprietorship, Corporation, etc.), Insurance, Employment and Labor Laws, and most importantly specific issues associated with Texas. For instance, Texas requires Franchise Tax be paid by all corporations and Limited Liability Companies. Texas also requires a Sales and Use Tax form be completed for any business selling taxable items (tangible and intangible property). I have read the other book ""How to Incorporate and Start a Business in Texas"" but it is more focused on the legal rammifications of corporations and not on specific Texas related issues. It is also good, but I recommend this book because it covers basically everything. Great reference manual."
2,Not A Serious Source of Knowledge,"If you're even moderately aware of the basics of business, such as what you would learn getting an undergraduate degree in business (or maybe in just one or two courses), then this book won't tell you anything you don't already know. It spends a lot of time listing basic terms and defining them. By basic, I mean mentioning that a sole proprietorship is a business run by an individual. I was done with it in 20 minutes and I don't consider myself anywhere close to an expert on the subject."
2,Terrible Packaging,"We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box. No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans. How clean are cardboard shipping boxes? The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges. The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging."
1,This version leaves out the Hebrew and Greek,"This version leaves out the Hebrew and Greek words, numbers and lexicons, which are usually the reason for buying a Strong's concordance. It is useful only for locating passages, which would be OK except that it trades on the Strong's name recognition without delivering what Strong's is all about. If you just want to locate passages, it is about the same as any other similar concordance."
4,really good buy,"I have been wanting a concordance for a very long time.I wasn't really sure if I would know how to use it but I did just fine.I had looked everywhere and in every Bible I had,(about 7-10 different versions).I looked up one word in the Strong's concordance and there it was.I could have looked there first but didn't have one.My preacher recomended the Strongs and i'm glad he did.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't used it that much but I am sure it would rate the 5 stars.Plus at Amazon I was able to get it because it had a lower price and it is as good as new.I would be proud to own it if it didn't even have a cover as long as it was complete.Thanks again,Amazon.l.s. in Texas"
4,Good resource,"I really like the book, very good resource. It is very thorough. The only drawback for me was that it didn't contain definitions. It contained all the locations for everything you could think of in the Bible. I highly recommend it if you only want to know where to find items."
2,NEED A MAGNIFIED GLASS TO READ!,THE FONT IS SO SMALL THAT I HAVE TO USE A MAGNIFIER WITH A LIGHT TO READ. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK EVEN IF YOU HAD SUPERB EYESIGHT!
4,Circle Pendant,I wear this pendant everytime we go someplace special. Goes well with everyting and looks great
4,missing info,"Most of the reviews were very good and helpful,but did not cover a glaring omission in this volume. It does not cover any of the master level prerequistes from master level three and up.these prerequsite quests are essential to get credit for the master levels at the arbiter."
3,reveal the true,"commited to breathing is a very good book. It could give you many facts about our society. Also, words in this book is very emotional. three are many things in this book that could awake you to the world that we live in."
5,Bought a book,"My book arrived in a very timely fashion and it was in great shape-as if NEVER opened! Loved the celephane wrapper--added to the Newness of it, even though it is supposed to be used!"
5,Haynes Shop Manual,I have used Haynes for several of my vehicles and found them to be quite comprehensive. I usually try to get both Haynes and Chiltons manuals as where one misses something the other picks up. I would not say that one is better than the other but compliment each other. In this case I was able to purchase both manuals
3,Wow i'm really impressed.,"I saw this doll today in the store and i was really impressed. Usually dolls made to look like real people just end up looking creepy, but the puffy ami yumi dolls look really cute, especially Yumi. I don't like the voice thing though, the voice is low quality and sounds weird. But i'd buy the doll for looks, she's mega cute."
1,"Cuddly, cute and racist!","I may be stating the obvious but I can't help but notice that the two Puffy dolls of Ami and Yumi in this set don't look very Japanese. In fact, to my British eyes they look cheesily American, with all the benefits of orthodontistry that go with that tag! The girls are Japanese (obviously) and they sing mostly in Japanese - would it not be possible to have had dolls that reflected that at least in some small part? Otherwise they might as well just be Bratz! I would have bought them for my daughter if they'd look the real deal. It's pathetic really."
3,good mascara but not fully waterproof,I found this mascara came off below my eye after swimming (and I wear goggles.) I'm looking for another one that is waterproof. It goes on well and looks good.
4,Golf shoe,"These are my first pair of golf shoes and they're comfortable. I've walked a couple courses with them and it's got a good grip. I used the spike Stinger made from Champ.The pair I bought didn't come with spike. I had to paid an extra $11 for the spikes, which sucked. Other than that, it's a fine product."
4,Bite Impact are as comfortable and light as they are good looking.,"I was shocked when they arrived to find out that Bite is a division of Crocks, and they are made with the same lightweight foam material. They are very light for a shoe that looks like it would be heavy. To me, they were the best looking shoe of ALL the golf shoes on Amazon. They look almost as good in real life.I wore them for the fist time yesterday and walked 18 holes pulling a cart, anyway, they were as comfortable at the end of 18 as when I teed off on number one."
4,Totally sastisfied,I order this book at Amazon and I receive it really fast in comparaison of the date that it was supposed to arrive at my home.And the book really respond to my expectation. So thank you for all.
3,It DOES smell,"I thought that these above posters were exaggerating when they said that this comforter smells, but MAN, it is HORRID. I took it out of the bag and set it in my closet and my whole room smells like it. I'm thinking I'm going to have to leave it outside on the porch overnight or something...it's almost unbearable."
3,"comforter,free smell..","well,for 80% off what do u expect???nice comforter with good quality.but it comes with a smell.can u believe it???this is the first time i have seen new clothes smell.couldnt sleep on it.still not doing it.i have to find ways to get rid of the smell.if anyone knows,let me know.(probably amazon.com should give a free advice when selling it,atleast in parenthesis.if i can get rid of the smell,i'de be a happy customer."
5,dalfan,"This is one of Don Johnsons older movies, but is fun to watch and see him play a different character. It is a light hearted movie, and Susan Sarandon is great in this movie. Really fun to see them in these roles."
5,Favorite Movie. a must see,"Has everything you could want and more , love this classic . My husband and I love to watch every holiday season."
1,Issues with Sharp's DV-HR300U,"After reading the reviews and researching DVR's, we purchased the Sharp DV-HR300U. We found the user manual difficult to follow, especially the trouble shooting and error message section. We were receiving error messages the guide did not address.We called Sharp's tech support and although they were very nice, they have little experience with the product and just read the user manual back to us. The tech support people enlisted help from supervisors and product trainers, to no avail. They repeatedly said that ""this product is just too new, we don't have any experience with it"".We were able to pause live TV, record onto the hard drive (after a call to support)and view a DVD. We were never able to record on to a DVD (even after a very long support call) and we were were never able to get the Auto Recording function to work (even after two calls to support) The result: we returned the product."
1,Mine's defective,Edit - I wrote a very negative review of this product. Bottom line is I have a defective unit so I can't really give a solid review. It still gets one star.
5,Great machine,Finally something that can replace your VCR and do more. Easy to use once you figure out all the steps. Be sure to read the manual.
5,"Amazing ""all natural"" body cream","I use this cream all over my body, on my face too....not just on my feet as the label implies. It is very nourishing...my skin drinks it in. It has a crisp, soft, clean scent that stays with you all day."
2,Stream of conciousness,"I'm dissapointed in this book. I wanted to understand, continue to want to understand. But the explanations in this book are breathless - very quickly presented with little in the way of justification or exploration of why... or some of the alternatives. I don't doubt the sincerity of the writer, but I don't find it credible compared to say the Lost Key of the Budha or the Dissapearing Universe. Or even Journey of Souls.Maybe there is some reality in this - but it doesn't come across. Reads like the teacher was teaching on automatic pilot, and genuine teaching seems more grounded."
4,My 2 cents,"This album gets 4 stars in my book. I thought it was definately worth the buy but it's not as good as I thought it would be. I rated 4 stars more because this is the kind of Hip-Hop I grew up with and love and we need to see much more of it these days. Kids growing up now will unfortunately never know and understand what true Hip-Hop is thanks to the radio and it's brainwashing. Buy this album, support the real!"
3,Solid BCC Album,"This is a good CD. The rappers all are on point. Some of the beats are boring, but it's still a good CD. And like the other guy said, what's up with the beatminerz only laying one track? It's not what I expected, but it's still good."
3,one of there less better albums,"plain and simple this album is a bit weak,i love the boot camp and have ALL there albums,but i just could not get into it,just not up to boot camp standard."
4,This book is still great practical management book,"This book is still great to read if you are looking for a practical management guide. It is not very long, and tells the management issues simply, giving you a practical work-environment examples. This book does not require you to read the one minute manager. It can be read separately, although you might get more out of it if you read first the one minute manager. The style is not a research-style but more aimed for ""normal"" managers who are busy and stressed, and want to read something easy and quickly that would help them improve their management style and practices."
1,a disappointment,"As a follow up to the One Minute Manager, this book was a slow and boring read. Reality and this book do not go hand in hand."
2,Eh....,"I stopped reading it after two chapters. Maybe I should have started with the original book? The advice seems practical enough, and if one's worked in the real world with any kind of practical mind, most advice gotten out of it will seem obvious. What turned me off is the way the book is written; a dialog between one who's learning and one who knows the helpful advice. But it tries to hard to make the suggestions clear and simple that the reader feels like their being talked to like a simpleton. It almost reads like a children's book. Annoying.If the reader can get past that, you may find some worthwhile advice in here. I already gave my copy free to the library."
4,"Concise, pragmatic advice","Concise, pragmatic advice on management practices: goal setting, praise, reprimands. This book serves as a great reminder that you don't have to have a PhD, or read every tome on leadership and management to be successful - more often than not, little changes can make a significant impact. An easy read, and one worth revisiting every once in a while."
4,Good stuff.,"This book is definately informative. It's a good technique, and I like the story approach."
1,Borderline fraudulent warranty,"WeatherTech says they have a 10-year warranty, until you try and use it - realize the warranty applies ONLY if you purchased directly from WeatherTech... purchased from Amazon, there is NO manufacturer warranty.I had a fitment issue and they gave me the runaround before refusing to warranty it. There is nowhere in the text I can find where the warranty is only good for direct purchases.The front drivers side mat didn't fit right as many have mentioned, and only got worse... good luck trying to fix it. Next time I'll buy Made in China, where at least I know they'll stand up to the warranty."
3,Not what I expected it to be..,"First off, they look cool and they cover everything I'd want it to..but all it is is a thin piece of formed plastic.. (think rubbermaid)Not rubber like you'd think they'd be..My shoes touch these and it sounds like I'm tap dancing..they call the material they use a High-density tri-extrude material..a.k.a. a semi flexable plastic..I myself wish they were more rubber like with deeper channels..but they should do the job..these are in a 2002 Toyota Tacoma..Do you enjoy your Tacoma? check out [...]Tell em Chris D. sent yaChris D."
1,"THE CHEAT ME, I LOOSE MY MONEY","This articles Y bought because on the Hummer area they describe that fit for H3 2009, I received already but not fit at all, the cheat me I loose my money"
1,Floor mats don't fit when you order using Amazon's sizing tool,"I ordered these based on entering my year, make and model of vehicle. When I received them, they DIDN'T FIT.Ok, no problem, let's just return them to Amazon, no problem.Except...they decided to charge me for shipping for returning them due to ""Customer Return"".They don't cover the floor (seemed way too small--would've done better with a cheap bigbox brand of floormat). The amount that is there doesn't fit as precisely as the marketing would lead one to believe (e.g. laser measured and size for a perfect fit--or some such verbiage).Don't understand Amazon's policy on returns. I returned the items (in NEW condition) because they don't fit (after using Amazon's tool to order them. And they decide to charge me the ~$8 for return shipping.Very unsatisfying on several levels."
2,Not custom fit,"The claim is that these are precision designed & manufactured to fit your vehicle perfectly. If you get a set that proves to be that way, you're probably lucky. I wasn't, mine was far from a close fit. I noticed that on the box they came in was a long list of truck models and years that were supposed to be ""compatible"" with the set I received, so clearly they are not fit model-by-model. I had the most problems with the driver's side mat. It did not lie flat, it had a bulge that was out of alignment and it did not lie in place because unlike the photographs, there was a hole for only one locking tab, not two. Finally, these do not look or feel like they are ""extreme duty,"" at least not for what I would guess to be no more than a few years.I'm returning them. For a lot less I can get much more substantial rubber mats that while aren't ""designed"" to be a perfect fit, will work just about as well as these and, I'm pretty sure, for a much longer time."
1,Bad fit for 2010Tundra,These liners were such a bad fit for my 2010 Tundra that I had to return them. The drivers side was the worse of the two.I would say it would be unsafe to drive with them.
4,floor liners,"These liners are effective but I would like to see the lip at the drivers side door be made higher. On my Subaru Forester the is about a 2 inch gap in which the carpet is still exposed. On my Legacy the lip is a little higher.i would say,on the whole,these work well."
5,floor mats,"They are great, and they fit perfect!! I just wish they came in many more colors. They look great in the truck."
4,Be Warned!,I bought these in the used section for $17 but they came new in the box so I Can't complain too much. They slide all around and don't stay in the same place. Thought about fastening them down somehow but Havnt yet.
2,Another person confusing pedophilia with homosexuality,"Generally I agree with the author's perspective about stories and how personal and societal views affect and distort the delivery of justice in US courts. However, I was profoundly disturbed by the fact that MOST of the cases she used to illustrate this with regard to the prosecution of so-called crimes involving homosexuality actually involved adult men abusing children. Of course she was not alone in her confusion of child sexual molestation and homosexuality - the prosecutors and judges were also confused, as in most of these cases, the charges appear to have been homosexuality or sodomy and not the more appropriate charge of sexual abuse of a child. Berry does a huge disservice to the gay rights movement by failing to acknowledge this distinction."
3,"Sometimes Cryptic, but full of info?","I decided to give it a 3 star, but I want to caution the reader of this review about the 3rd star. The book is very cryptic, it doesn't have a timeline, it doesn't have specifics about the details of the scrolls, but it's more as a reference interpretation. There are some chapters that are really valuable, that delves into the thinking of the group of folks who wrote the scrolls, their thoughts and their understandings of life. Think of this as the writings of the scrolls themselves, and their interpretation. If you need a book on the background of the discovery and more about speculation, this is not it! The author plays it safe by just interpreting them. Great school material, and also for research. I wish I knew Hebrew, it would have made it more fun to read and understand!"
2,Disappointed,"When I read the ads for the DVDs I thought I was buying the games. Play by play from start to finish. Why couldn't that be the case? Why cant the game be sold? Wouldn't you guess that by the title you were getting the game? When I buy a concert I expect the concert, unless I am buying highlights.The video is high quality and in slow motion with season highlights added too. If I wanted that I would expect a title ""Season and Superbowl Highlights.""I feel shortchanged. I wanted the whole game.Ed E. Ted"
1,The games are not on these DVD's,"Just a bunch of choppy hi-lights, a play or two here and there, and then a big jump to another part of the game. I hated this one so much that it prompted me to post my very first amazon review"
3,slghtly different finish,I ordered the wooden salad bowl mahogany set but wanted 2 additional bowls. The extra bowls don't quite match the set (interior)
4,A Fun New Character,"Theresa Joanne, a.k.a. TJ, has never had to worry about being by herself. She's always had her best friend there to help her through every problem in her life, but now she's facing the school year alone, since her best friend has now moved away. But when Lucy becomes friends with T.J., she begins to think that maybe there's still hope for a fun new friendship. But now T.J. is worried about Nesta and Izzie, Lucy's two best friends. She doesn't know whether they will accept her or not, and that's making her more nervous than ever before.Hopkins has done a wonderful job in slipping in T.J. as a new character. T.J. is spirited, and adds a new attitude to the MATES, DATES... series. A must-have book for all fans of Hopkins' previous works."
3,On a par with Designer Divas,"Book four of this series introduces us to T.J. Her life has just turned topsy turvy as her to best mates, her best friend and her brother, have just left the country (friend has moved for good and brother is traveling for a year). Now she is all alone.But don't worry, Lucy, Izzie and Nesta has assessed the situation and are moving ion to make a new friend. Meanwhile, T.J. has become interested in being the new editor for the school paper. Add a boy or two to the mix (and a little snogging) and you get the idea.Although better than the first two books, it is nowhere near as good as the Louise Rennison books. But I am glad to see that as with the third, this series is no longer trying to imitate the Rennison books.If you liked the earlier ones, you will surely like this one as it is one of the two best in the series (Designer Divas being the other)."
1,"Boys, makeup, snogging, etc...","Funny how all the other reviews say this is a great girly book, and not a good book for tom-boys when the main character is one. This book is kind of telling tom-boys that if they don't get a make-over they won't get a boyfriend--what a wonderful image to project! The first two books in the series were a bore-- definitely not great... Once Nesta's view picked up it went even more downhill. Basically these books are about boys, kissing, dating, etc with other storylines around them like finding out what your career should be, to name one. I wouldn't really recommend any of these books."
3,For the mid-range runner,"I found the previous reviews interesting because they suggested that this book was for seasoned runners. As a seasoned runner, I didn't find it extremely useful. It discussed things that I have already heard of.Overall, I would suggest it to someone who has been running for a year or two and is now interested in racing but isn't sure where to start. It offers training insights without the technical jargon that seasoned runners, such as myself, throw around without even thinking. For those very new to running, this may be a little too much to think about. For those who have been around the block quite a few times, you probably have heard this all before."
1,Severely disappointed,I just received my tin and was severely disappointed. The sign is extremely thin and cheap looking. Had it cost $5 I wouldn't be so upset but since it was 3xs that much I was expecting better quality and perhaps the tin to be beveled and thicker. You can actually see the pixels in the printing of the picture on the tin. I am sending it back tomorrow. I
1,Too Flemsy or thin,"It looked nice online but when I got it, the metal is too thin, and too flemsy for the price. I wouldn't recommend this product, it's not worth the price... it is way too thin to even be put on the wall and it bends too. I guess you could use it as a fan or to speed up the firepit outside? LOL."
2,Good for beginners..,"I found this book to be a good beginner book in trading . The chapters didn't go into much depth for more advanced traders . I would say that if your imtimidated by math then this book will be a good buy , but if you want depth and a bang for your buck ..you could do better."
1,Not worth the money,"Very basic book not worth the $1.... I have been in the derivative market for 5 years. For a beginner, there are much better books out there that cover all the material of this book in one chapter."
4,"Original is still my favorite, but remixes are good too...","The original version of this song is still my favorite, but the remixes here are good too, just a different take. If you're a Sharon Redd fan and want to add to your collection, this would be a worthy addition."
4,Mistress Pat,"As always Lucy Maud Montgomery's work is a time capsule brought to life, saying much about a rural young lady's life in the 1920's. However as a sequel to ""Pat of Silver Bush"" I was a bit disappointed in this book. I truely loved ""Pat of Silver Bush"" and ordered ""Mistress Pat"" as soon as I finished its prequel. Somewhere between books my affection and interest in Pat as a character was lost. Pat seems rather silly and at times downright infuriating in this book. The rest of the cast of characters is as interesting as ever and Judy Plum is truely a gem of a character. If you have a burning desire to discover Pat's eventual fate read this book. If not leave her the charming young lady found in ""Pat of Silver Bush"" and read another of Lucy Maud's books which even the worst of are somehow better than modern fiction."
3,Mistress Pat,"The edition of this book I received is different than the one shown when I bought it. I even paid more money for it, thinking that it was the edition I wanted."
4,Interesting,"SHe was interesting, but I agree with what someone else said that she needed depth. I found a writer and was inspired by it.I found the David character particulary interesting. He was like Dean but not quite so vile. And he didn't do to Pat what Dean did to Emily."
3,interesting....,"I found that Pat was interesting surfacely, but lacked depth somewhat. She has a lot of room for developement through the approximate decade of the novel's span, yet does not seem to transform. She is somewhat predictable. Since the previous novel portrays Pat's charming childhood, I was hoping to read and find a real woman full of Valancy Stirling-like passion and Anne-like spirit, and Emily-like intellect---I found Pat was wanton of the emotions and qualities that separate Montgomery's characters from so many others. Also, I disliked the lack of Jingle in the book. When he is present in the few scenes he appears in he has a dominating effect. LM should have taken better advantage of this strength. David is a wonderful character with an eccentric Dean Priestish air to him. Try it--- but if you want a complicated read with a little more substance and something to think and devour over-- stick to the Blue Castle."
2,This book is pretty but soulless.,His pictures are good for calendar-tops. It is stereotypical. Technically his pictures are perfectly exposed and perfectly composed. The pictures in the book lacks the creative spark that motivates us to go out and shoot.
4,"Great book, worth the money....",This book was written in my favorite format: A great picture followed by a text describing the technique used. You are expected to know your way around the camera as well as different lens characteristics so there's not a lot of repetitive text found in other books. I would have preferred that more technical data and technique descriptions were included but what's there is quite enough. The pictures are quiet inspiring. And the techniques explained helped me a lot to produce better pictures. I highly recommend this book. Worth the money.
4,"The Birds, The Frogs, and the Stream","The frogs are the only thing that can get a tad annoying if you are trying to sleep to this CD. One of them make a kind of sharp frog noise which can be slightly startling if you're asleep. Otherwise this CD is a great combination of a soft, flowing stream, birds in the forrest, and frogs near the water. It certainly takes me back to my country roots in Alabama and Florida whenever I listen to this CD. Certainly a worthy addition to a Magic Moods collection!"
3,Quirky,"I read this for a book club. It's OK, but I found it hard to get inside the characters' heads. If you want a quirky, quick, read go ahead. if your looking for great writing or passion, give it a miss."
3,Ummmmm,Okay- I get it but I don't like the seemingly sloppy way it was written where it could be way above most peoples intellects. I enjoyed the stories but just wished the connection was seen earlier in the plot. Halfway through I was still confused about where Changing Woman and Coyote fit in.
1,This book was the biggest waste of my time,King's idea of writting may appeal to the biggest nerds in the world but not to me or anybody else I spoke to.
4,"Green Grass, Running Water","In this book, king clearly illustrates the great differences between the native american people and the ""new"" inhabitants of America. By interweaving biblical allusions into his text, the reader is required also to think at what appears in front of him on the page. The book is written in a very witty way, and hence might appear a bit childish at first glance. Once the reader is able to look beyond this cover, a new challenging dimension of the book unfolds. This short review is an invitation as well as a recomemdation to purchase and bey this book!"
2,Be warned: Tracks repeated,"Besides suffering from the same malady asKaraoke Party: Retro 70s & 80s (Dig), in that it has the whole track listing repeated in vocal version, it also has some duplication from that set. Other than that, it's pretty standard."
3,Useful but not everything you may need,"I bought this book when I was a beginner to learn how to knit.From the online reviews it looked like it was the book I havebeen looking for.And in many ways it is. It has a lot of useful information aboutknitting and the reasons behind doing things the way described.However, the actual part where the author described the stitchesare impossible. Most instructions are based on a simple drawing that is illegible. You cannot really tell which way the stitchshould be formed.Given that the drawing is black and white and very basic, it is really hard to make anything out of it.That's when I actually needed a second book with nice illustrations and everything became much clearer.Apart from this, all the other useful tips were invaluable.I would also prefer if there were more projects at the back."
4,anecdotal,"I must say, I enjoyed reading this book. The author talks about knititng in a very casual, anecdotal manner--you hear stories of knitters she has known, of yarns she has purchased, of sweaters she has knit. Many of her stories are amusing while also practical. Reading this book is like learning from the mistakes of others.However, alone, this book is not enough to teach you how to knit. While it is worthwhile reading for the tips you pick up, if you need to look up a particular technique, you might be better using a book that is more organised, or with chapter headings that are less humourous and more informative.When you first start to knit, reading this book is like having a friend by your side telling you where you can go wrong, and for that is very useful. But it is best used in conjunction with some other less chatty book, such as Debbie Bliss's ""How to Knit"" or one of the many encyclopedias of knitting techniques (many excellent OP titles can be found at second hand bookstores)."
2,Not for beginners,"Not a good book if you have never knitted before. Very few pictures to get you started. If you know the basics if might be okay. It was good for reading about gauge, needles and yarns, but not to learn how to start."
2,"Some good instructions, but far too cutesy and verbose","Forgive me, but I found this to be one of the most annoyingly written books ever. There is some fine information, but the reader has to cut through miles of superfluous chatter to reach it. What was the editor thinking?"
4,A Classic for Knitters,Maggie is a great writer with an amazing understanding of the emotional stress of knitting.
5,Excellent reference & common sense knitting book,"This is the book I recommend to every new knitter - full of practical information, advice and humor. I treasure my copy!"
1,kniting in plain english,"Book was a little hard to understand for a beginner, and that was what I was looking for. I hate to say but I feel it was a waste of money. This is not a beginner book."
5,Great for Beginner and Advance too!,I was very impressed with the clarity of her directions and the obvious thought and experience that went into them. This book is a MUST HAVE for any knitters library. I wouldn't be without it and would give it as a gift to anyone just starting out. She rates up there with Walker and Zimmermann as I see it. Barbara
5,A wonderful introduction to knitting.,"Maggie Rigehtti's book is a must for anyone interested in learning how to knit. It is clearly written and illustrated, two facts much appreciated by this novice. Best of all, drawing upon her broad experience as a knitting instructor, Maggie writes with a wit and warmth for the subject which conveys the joy and excitement of knitting. I suspect even experienced knitter's will find KNITTING IN PLAIN ENGLISH invaluable."
5,Fantastic resource,"I am a novice knitter who can't learn fast enough. This book has some great lessons, including some on problems I didn't realize I was having. I especially liked the author's honesty about how difficult buttonholes are. You could learn how to knit from this book but it is probably most useful as a learning tool once you've made a few scarves and have moved on to reading patterns."
4,The most amusing knitting book I've read!,"I learned to knit from the ""I can't believe I'm knitting!"" pamphlet, but when I was ready to move on past the basic stitches I read this book. Not only did it give me more of an appreciation for knitting, it also made me laugh out loud more than once. Maggie's instructions are clear and the drawings are easy to follow. I've found her instructions for invisible increases and decreases to be invaluable, and I love the tips such as using 'idiot tags' and what you should carry in your knitting bag. I do wish the beginner's projects were a big smaller, as I don't need a scarf and shawls aren't the fashion, but I can't wait to try the Dumb Baby Sweater pattern."
3,Good for beginners but bad gauge square advice,"This is a pretty good introduction for someone who's looking to improve from a 'beginner' to an 'intermediate beginner' or thereabouts. I was looking for more information for an intermediate to advanced knitter and was disappointed.One thing I take major issue with, however, is her advice to cast on a gauge square that's 4 inches square. This is disasterous advice in my opinion. I strongly urge any knitter doing a big project where fit will matter, to knit *at least* 6 inches square, and to do a non-roll stitch pattern on the edges (in addition to the 6x6 area to be measured). It's far too easy to miss a 1/2 stitch variance or similar on such a small gauge square (particularly if your edges are rolling), such that your garment doesn't fit right."
3,Beautiful photography - many varieties listed,I find the title slightly misleading since it implies it will go into detail of what to expect and run into when growing lavender. The book mainly covers all the different varieties of Lavenders and their subcategories. All in all an informative work with beautiful photography.
4,Good lavender book IF you are interested in botany,"Lavender by Virginia McNaughton is a great book for the person who desires to study the botany of lavender plants. With its very detailed botanical explanations of every variety of lavender, this book might be perhaps too scientific for a casual fan of the lavender plant. However, lavender farmers and those wishing to know more of the science behind the plants will find this book extremely helpful."
2,Not an Enjoyable Read,"Very disappointed with this one. Although the author is quite knowledgeable about the subject matter, for the lay person, too much of the book is dedicated to the description of each cultivar, etc. Not enough attention given to propagation and care for the average gardener.The book is written in a very condescending way and I felt that the author is a bit ""out of touch"" with the rest of us who are interested in lavender but do not need to know the anatomy of each species. There are certainly more enjoyable books out there on the subject that are a pleasure to add to your home library--this is NOT one of them."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I bought these pictures to go with the bedding set, and when I took them out of the box, two of them were scratched. Even though they were wrapped with some kind of padding, two of them rubbed together and chipped the paint off. I drove an hour to the store so returning them is not that easy. I don't think I will be able to match the paint so I will probably end up painting them over myself. They are shown on the box picture as being hung with ribbons, but you will need to purchase that yourself. The pictures themselves are very pretty. They match the pictures in the quilt and valance, made with the same fabric exactly. I think they are a nice ensemble for the nursery, but beware for damages. I should have opened the box and looked at them... I just took it for granted they would be fine since the box was unsealed."
3,Better quality frames needed!,"I agree with the last review...the pictures are great, however the frames leave something to be desired. While my frames weren't scratched, the corners of the frames were seperated leaving big cracks. I took them back, thinking it must have been a defective set I grabbed. However, after searching through the five sets they had, I realized the corners of all the frames were seperated. I finally chose the set with only one bad frame, and decided to sand them all down, fill in the crack with wood putty, and paint all of the frames white. And, add the ribbon that is not included. Somewhat disappointed!"
4,Not the best choreography; well performed,"This isn't deathless dance. The Strauss score is, well, Strauss: lots of sound and fury, signifying very little. The dance has many whiffs of art deco; it's a little confusing at times, rarely inspired. Not bad, though. The dancers are quite good: Jamison is a magnificent being, and it's always good to see her; Haigen - pretty, and nearly naked through much of the show - is highly adept and expressive."
4,A Laugh out Loud Adventure,"This is a really fun read! Perry has a great way of making the reader root for the bad guys. The concept is extremely farfetched, but, somehow, I didn't care. The idea by the two capers is really a joke that just keeps going beyond anywhere they could have ever expected. When a completely ludicrous idea is suggested, the characters recognize the ridiculousness, and then do it anyway. This is no run of the mill novel. It can be kind of hard to find, sense it is out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy, I highly recommend it."
2,Island,"The other books I have read by Thomas Perry, I really enjoyed. This was was slow and wordy... full of political irony as relates to caribbean poltics."
5,Groovy present,"My three year old just got the entire dreamtastic set for her birthday. What a great gift! These dolls are fun, funky and chunky enough for a three year old, yet kids of 7 were crazy about them too. I will definitely be getting more of these...way better than barbie!"
4,Fun Little House,"We recently purchased this playhouse, and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters (I don't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description). Our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it, but I would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually ""do"" inside the house. The doorbell makes fun sounds. It is very easy to put together!"
3,not worth the money,"I was a little disappointed when we received this playhouse...It didnt have peek a boo shutters and there is nothing to do on the inside, I personally feel this is quite overpriced and we have only had it for 2 days and my daughter is already bored."
4,Just Right,"I spent a lot of time searching for the perfect playhouse for my son for Christmas. I really didn't need to look any further than this one. The price was perfect, size is just right, and I know I can't really go wrong with Little Tikes. I'm very happy with my purchase and my son loves his new house."
3,Not great but not totally awful...,"The formerly acclaimed franchise mode is back with new features like minor league management and the implementation of the salary crap. But how do you turn the salary cap off? You can't... Also, improving your team in the franchise mode is much too difficult. The gameplay is similar to last years but a few issues have been fixed like your goalie is maybe a little better and you can now score on first shots occasionally.One thing that was not fixed is the A.I. for instance, your teammates are not as offensively good as they were last year and they are not real helpful defensively either.The commentary still needs to be improved and the new button/control scheme is really odd to me,someone who has played the NHL series of games for over 14 years.I still think that NHL 04 was the best game EA has made in the past 5 years, if you already own nhl 06 then why waste 30 dollars on this slightly updated version?"
2,What everyone else said!,"The most frustrating aspect of this game is moving from medium to difficult level. If you read any of the previous reviews, it is EXACTLY what they said. The hockey doesn't get any better or any smarter. It simply puts the computer opponent into invinicible mode. Your no longer able to poke check or body check the opponent, they just bounce off you and eventually get the pass off in front of your goalie and the opponent 1 times the puck into the net. (Especially since your goalies suck, they only get about 10-15 shots per game and let in 7 or 8 goals) Also the opponent needs only skate in your direction to knock the puck away from you when your on offense.But medium difficulty is easy and boring because you win every game 10-1.So, I uninstalled after I won the Stanley Cup as the Rangers on medium rating.Weak. Super... Super.. Weak."
3,Fun for a while,"This game is fun for a while. If you are playing with a keyboard it is allmost impossible unless u can deal with carpool tunel. I was hoping you could control the stick with the mouse, but the mouse is not used in the game. Lets be honest sport games are all about the dynasty season. In NHL 2007 it basically sucks.Pros- semigood graphics,All the nhl players,challenging ai units.Cons- Impossible with a keyboard, season mode sucks, no ppl online, ear ringing metal musicOverall this is a game for hockey fans with a pc controller"
3,"Overall, a good game","For me, the last EA sports game I bought for PC was Triple Play Baseball 2001. Forward about six years, and the graphics, gameplay, and everything else of NHL07 compares miserably. This was my FIRST NHL game I got on my PC, so I had nothing to compare to.THE GOOD:1)The graphics are okay, but the faces of the players were good.2) Contract negiotations and forming a team that you want.3) There were some roster updates throughout the year.THE BAD:1) After much reading other peoples' reviews, I realized I bought a game that is virtually the same for the past 3 years.2) Horrible AI and redundant one timers and toe-drag wristshort goals.3) Godlike speed bursts4) Can't really cycle the puckFor someone who hadn't bought an EA sports game in 5 years, this was right for me. Ah well, 20 bucks wasn't that bad."
1,Where's my install code?,"EA Sports forgot to include the code required for installation of the game onto my pc. Amazon was nice enough to send me a second copy asap. Again, no code. EA sports made me jump through hoops to get a code emailed to me. They wanted me to pay for shipping to return the game for a replacement. Despite tons of delays and frustration, my son loves the game."
3,"The Rise & Fall of the Confederate Government, part 2","Very detailed account of the Southern side of the Civil War, written by the man who knew it best. Not an easy read."
2,Balanced????,"The baton arrived ahead of schedule in a HUGE box... a total waste of packaging. It is really a heavy baton, not lightweight at all and it is not even remotely balanced. The balance point on mine was about 5 inches away from the handle. I will most likely not use this unless I need to throw my baton at a musician (only joking about the throwing part)."
2,Interferes with wireless networking,"This device is easy to operate, has sharp styling, and produces nice sound, but it sends out a shower of RF interference that affected with my wireless network immediately. Functions would not respond, my wireless mouse did not work properly, and within a few minutes I lost my wireless connection to both of my laptop computers. I reconnected and plugged in the transmitter again, and immediately lost my network connection once again. Sorry, this is useless with a wireless network...By far the best music player IN CONCEPT is the Linksys ""Wireless Bridge"" because it works through your existing wireless network, except that it simply DOES NOT WORK a lot of the time due to bugs in the software.Why can't someone invent a simple way to play stored music via wireless into a stereo without expensive, gimmicky boxes and concepts that DO NOT WORK?"
2,Will not work with T20 X-Fi speakers.,"Be aware that this product does not work with the wireless feature of the T20 speakers.It does work fine as a single transmitter to receiver combination and if you bypass the wireless capability of the T20 speakers, they can be used as 'dumb' speakers with the receiver. You also will find that additional receivers are as scarse as unobtainium, so I am unable to report on how a multi-room system might behave. I thought that since both products were Creative's X-Fi wireless technology and many people were buying the T20 speakers with this product, that they would work together. I could not have more wrong.Please don't be fooled as I was. If you buy this product, expect it to work will only with the included receiver and nothing else.Also be aware the included documentation is very poor."
5,Works flawlessly--even with my 2.4GHz wireless network,"I've had it for about a month and it works great. Opened the box, plugged in the USB cable and voila--music streaming wirelessly. It was really that easy. And it's much cheaper than a Sonos unit for ~$1,000, although I'm sure the Sonos product has it's advantages.Also, my ATT U-Verse router is 2.4 GHz, but I do not notice any interference with the sound or my network. According to the documentation, it comes with a ""sniffer"" that finds an unused channel on the frequency, and it seems to work.My only annoyance is that you can only play sound on your computer speakers OR the Xmod. But this is a Windows issue, not a defect of the product. It seems that Windows will only recognize one sound device at a time, so I've created a desktop shortcut to let me switch between the two. It's not a big deal.Overall, I think it works exactly as advertised."
2,Not a great broadcast range,"I bought this system so I could play music from my computer on the second floor to my in-ceiling speaker system on the first floor. I hooked up one unit to my computer and the other to my stereo receiver. It took me a while to figure out which jack to plug it into, but I eventually got it too work. Only problem was the strength of the signal...very weak and crackly. I had to move the two units as close as possible to each other to get somewhat acceptable sound, but it was very unaesthetic. I would have preferred if the units could remain out of site, but the signal is too weak for that. I don't use them much anymore now that it is so easy to download everything onto my iPod and connect that to my stereo receiver instead. Eventually, I will buy a new stereo receiver with a USB slot making it even easier."
1,didn't work,Never got it to work. I spent 1 hour on my own trying and an additional 45 minutes with tech support. Nothing. Sent it back for refund.
2,It has potential... to screw up your wireless network,"Bought the Wireless XMOD after I bought a new wireless router (DLink DIR-655). Wife's macbook could access the wireless network fine until I hooked up the XMOD.Apparently the Creative Wireless interferes with other things in the 2.5ghz spectrum.Called Creative. There is no way to disable the wireless feature. I even removed the wireless module from inside the XMOD and my system wouldn't recognize it any longer. Put the module back in and covered the XMOD with aluminum foil, hoping to create a sort of Faraday cage... Didn't help.It's as good as garbage right now."
1,Don't waste your money,This product will shortly be in the dust bin of bad technology. I have several Creative Labs products and all of them are pretty good. My Audigy 2Z platinum pro is great on my desktop. But I'm looking for a laptop media solution and this was not a good choice. First the unit reduces the volume output in all modes from the original source. Second the unit does not work with any of the media players on my laptop including one by Creative. Third the units volume control does not work when you use it digitally through the USB port as designed. I didn't even bother hooking up the receiver when I saw the transmitter does not work. Forget about any help what-so-ever from Creative. They only answer you with automated emails and their call in line is useless. This product looks great but it does not live up to the hype.
4,Clear signal. good product,"Product does what it claims to do. The signal is good, sound is great and you can control what effects (only 2) you want if any. Remote controll is cool too (other than having ANOTHER remote in the never ending line of remotes). The only things i do not like is1) The signal is delayed a little (i.e over the air). Thus, you can't listen to your speaks on the PC at the same time as the speakers on your stereo because there is no delay in the sound coming from the PC to your PC speaks, but there is from the PC to these units.2) when you have the unit turned off, it blinks a red light to let you know its off. I do not know why in the would people make products like that. When I turn it off, I want it off! Just wastes electricity."
5,"So Far, It's Great!","I'd been wanting a way to get music from my office computer (downstairs in a lower-level room) to the living room stereo upstairs. This system sounded like just the thing. The box came with all the hardware, but there were no detailed instructions. However, I found them online and following them was simple. In pretty short order I had music broadcasting from my PC to the living room, which I could control from the LR with a remote. I haven't had many occasions to use it yet, so can't address the subject of reliability, or life of service. I also haven't accessed all the functions of which the system is capable, but so far it's great and I can recommend it heartily."
1,Sounded Terrible on my Stereo,"I was excited to see this because I love the idea of being able to hear MP3 files on the ""big stereo"" in the den. I have a very nice Yamaha receiver and Klipsch speakers, and when I hooked up this contraption, the sound was simply horrible. I tried all the adjustments I could find - like turning off any effects on my receiver and this thing...nothing worked. Very distorted sound, nowhere near as good as CD or even radio."
4,"Really like this, but ...","Great product, simple, inexpensive, truly plug and play, and good sound but can't seem to find the receiver only purchase option to add other systems to the transmitter's broadcast."
4,Good wireless transmission,"I got this to send music from my computer to my amplifier and big speakers. (A wired connection produced a good bit of hum, and I didn't want to string wires all across the living room anyway.) This set works very well. The sound quality is excellent. I mainly use this to listen to music from Classical Archive, a service presenting an enormous selection of classical music for $5.99 a month. It sounds essentially the same as my classical CDs using this system.The only reason I don't give this system 5 stars is that the documentation is very minimal. You pretty much have to rely on your previous experience with electronic music toys to set it up. There is no ""help"" for this system on Creative's site. It appears it is no longer being marketed by them, and you would have to buy two components totaling about $150 to do the same tasks. But if you want something cheaper to send sound from your computer to your main music system, this does the job very well for me."
3,A liberating device,"I am reducing the review of this product to a 3 since there is another product put out by Creative labs that works better than this product.My Old review:This device is quite pleasant to use and the sound quality is good provided there is no interference. We were pleasantly surprised. We set up a dedicated Asus EEE netbook to house our music collection and this device integrates seamlessly with it and broadcasts its music throughout our apartment. Considering how much radio interference there is in Manhattan, this is a great achievement. Now we simply move the speakers wherever we want and connect the speakers to the wireless receiver and we are set. The remote control works well, although there are functions we have not yet used. We also find it a plus that we can connect any mp3 player to the device and broadcast its music. I recommend this device for people that hate unsightly wires. One objection I have to this product is that it is somewhat bulky."
4,Xmod Wireless,"Works fairly well but if you want perfect sound, go with a wired solution. I used the setup to connect two receivers about 20 feet away. I'm going from the upstairs lofted area down into the main level. I wanted to have the same music playing on both levels.Even though the lag is small, it is noticeable when you stand between the two speakers. Sounds like an echo. I'm sure this would be okay if the speakers were in different rooms where you could only hear one set at a time. I also noticed skips in the sound every once in a while. I do live in the city condo where there are many wireless networks to compete with.I think the quality of this product is good, but my conditions are not ideal for it."
4,"Very nice gadget, but","For the price, it's very attractive,but the sound has a little background ""wooosh""and it's only 5 meters away..The X-Fi features aren't really adding quality,but the ease of use and plug and play features are awesome,all in all it's a fine product and I enjoy using it."
1,Good luck finding an extra receiver,"This pair worked great once I put the transmitter far away from my wireless internet. However, I then looked for a second receiver, and only then realized that Creative has stopped selling the transmitter / receiver combo, or the receiver by itself. Look for it on Creative's website yourself if you don't believe me. There is another creative wireless receiver that Creative is selling, but it is not X-mod, so does not work with this transmitter. So if you only need one pair, and don't mind throwing the whole thing away if the one receiver breaks, then go for it. Otherwise, I suggest going with something that a manufacturer is still supporting. I am happy for Amazon's return policy."
3,Missing power adapter,"Boxes inside of packaging had already been opened. Contents had been shifted around from original packaging, but everything was still there. Easy setup and works as advertised."
3,Good idea -- Terrible instructions,"This is a neat idea... transmitting songs throughout the house wirelessly. But the instructions are in every language EXCEPT English. There are pictures of how to set up the transmitter, but not a single drawing of how to set up the receiver. Once we hooked it up correctly, we discovered that the songs ""pause"" or ""skip"" when they are played in a house with a wireless network (which is just about every house these days). So we searched the internet and found a suggestion that the transmitter needs to be at least 10 feet from the household router. That's fine, but now we have to buy some extended cords to make that a reality. All in all, I still like the idea, but I think the instructions could be improved DRAMATICALLY and the interference issue needs to be resolved. Our neighbors have this system (which is where we first saw it) and they went back to hard-wired home computers instead of messing with the skips and pauses."
3,It works...but,It works good out of box and the sound quality is better than I expected...but it wipes out my WiFi. So it disables my wireless internet.
4,Works as advertised,"I've had the Creative Labs Xmod Wireless Music System for about four months now & it works fine. I previously had my pc hard wired to my stereo receiver but after moving things around the house, I did not want to re-run all the cables again. The system works a lot better then an older Logitech system I used for about a year. No interference at all. I use three receivers throughout my house - in the living room, garage & basement & I'm very happy with the way they work. The only ""issue, if you would call it that, is that the volume for itunes is alot lower when using this system, then when I use Windows Media Player, or listen to internet radio, but that's most likely an itunes issue. I'd recommend this setup to anyone who wants to listen to audio from their pc anywhere in the house."
1,Horrible design,"I purchased this product with the assumption that other reviewers that left negative comments did not know how to change their wireless broadcast channels. I should have listened to them. This system interferes with everything wireless in my home. My WiFi, My Logitech G7 cordless gaming mouse, even my Wiimotes for my wii. When I unplug this unit, all devices instantly start working normally. The product does not even work that very well requiring line of sight with no obstructions to prevent all ""sound hiccups"". Also, I thought they would have some way to mount this unit to the wall... NOPE. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. I don't really feel like dealing with the hassle of returning it so I'm just going to turn it into a big science experiment and take it apart to see how it works, maybe if I'm lucky I can make it work as it should."
2,So-So...,"The unit was very easy to use and set up. But the problem was with the sound. The skipping and popping sounds mentioned in older posts were evident right away. I searched out creative's tech support, played with the computer settings, and worked hard to have this work properly... and it didn't happen. The sound quality was excellent when it wasn't cutting out, which was about every 25 seconds. Oh, and I don't have a wireless router(a common interference problem) and the transmitter and receiver were only about 30 feet apart. Very disappointing for a Creative product. The unit is being returned as soon as the post office opens."
3,cool watch with problems,"On the upside, it looks nice, has decent functions, and has a bright indiglow light. On the downside, it's pointless to use any alarm or timer function seeing as you can barely hear it! Bottom line, I'm keeping my old watch for work and waking up, but keeping this as well for casual days."
1,very disappointed,"I purchased this watch as a gift for my husband. The first time it was shipped, the LED light cleared the display. I called Nike and they said it sounded like a movement issue, so I sent it back to the company that had shipped it. They sent me a ""new"" watch. It had the exact same problem. Nike wasn't aware of the issue with this watch, but it was the second time with the exact same problem. The store now has the watch on close-out so I will be unable to give it to my husband. Overall, I'm just very disappointed."
1,Stupid Watch,"This watch is basically a timex in a Nike case with a stupid watch band. The watch sits up very high (too high) for this type of band. The watch sticks out from your wrist and catches everything.Watch functions are basic stupid timex type. Chrono, timer, dual time, date, and data.Just a stupid watch. I was hoping for much more- not sure why, but I was."
4,Does it's job...,"Works as designed, would have given it five stars if the handle was more comfortable to use. I wrapped it with handlebar wrap."
1,Horribly Boring.....,"My advice: skip this one. I was hoping for a cheesy monster flick, but this was pretty unbearable. The monster effects weren't too bad and the locations were better than some studio movies (looks like it was shot in some real caves). I think it had potential. What screwed that up was the dragging plot. It went on and on without going anywhere. No amount of editing could fix it either. Never being funny or scary the movie was a real let down. Skip it."
1,"Very bad movie,by far the worst horror movie ever","This is one pathetic,sorry excuse for a horror movie and quite possibly the worst ever made with really bad acting,cheap,really cheap special efects(Ketchup and fake blood look more realistic) and those computer graphics were horrible,and the movie is plotless with production values of a home movie and the worst part is that atrocious organ music in the background.The plot(if there was one) deals with a monster that kills people in a cave and somewhat worships the devil.Avoid this one, if you buy it smash it with a sledgehammer and throw the pieces in a river and forget that losers make horror movies like this trash."
1,THE GRIM SLEEPER,"One word can sum up this movie: boring. Forget the lack of really good effects; acting; writing; direction. Forget the fact that the monster looks like an actor in heavy ineffectual makeup. I can accept cheesy horror movies, but none that are so boring as GRIM. The pacing is superlethargic, and the musical background atrocious. There were no scares, and only a few unintended laughs. Like where did Steve get the gong and hammer to play? And if Grim could walk through walls, how come he got clobbered by a collapse? Totally inane, and unfortunately, boring!"
5,Campy Fun,"Okay honestly, this movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, if not the worst. There is one reason to buy/watch this movie: if you like getting really sloshed and laughing your head off at the campilicous acting, ridiculous effects, and stinking script. Grim...is awesomely bad."
5,GRIM or Chupacabra?,"Basically, I just like how he looks. This movie may be scary o most viewers, but the people who gave it a bad review always judge it on the production values. What do they know about production values. Acting is sometimes off, and this is totally better than Fright Night, Pumpkin Head, and Scream. This movie you have to think. Those of you who don't like to think during a movie will hate it. No this will not stimulate those old brain cells and boggle your minds. If you want something like that read a book, but if you want to have some dumb fun, and make fun of a film this is the one!"
2,About a scary as an old sock,"This movie reeked. Not just of bad acting or plot, but it suffered the unfortunate disease known as cornymonsteritis. The monster in this movie, Grim, was less than scary, just kinda corny. This movie will tug at you in the night time, giving you equally corny nightmares. However, I decided to add one extra star since this movie had its share of gore and a few cool scenes. All in all, it still sucked!"
1,They Left the girl!!!,"Okay, the movie was horrible. The monster was beyond bad. It could walk through walls, floors, rock, etc. without leaving a hole and pull people through with him/her..It. whatever. The acting was really bad and the people searching through the cave made ever horror movie character mistake they could come up with and therefore got picked off one at a time. Though the plot was stupid and the acting lame, this movie actually left something of an impact...The girl in the cave. As the movie came to a close, I was thinking: ""What about the girl?"" Well, they did wrap that up finally. Her fate was truly grim. Gave me chills. The only thing worse than her fate was maybe actually paying money to watch this....Or worse. Being chained to a wall in a cave and having to watch it over and over again. That would drive anyone over the edge."
1,Grim- What an appropriate title,"This is one of the worst monster films of all-time. The origin of the monster is never explained, the special effects look like they were done with the old Video Toaster effects system, and the acting was bad all the way around. Throw in the very unlikeable characters, and you will regret ever popping this in your VCR because of the attractive video box cover art."
1,Grim indeed..,"This movie stinks!I saw this movie not too long ago and that had to be the worst decision of my entire existence.The plot is very confusing and you only get it if you watch it several times which I foolishly did, and had a temporary nervous breakdown.From what I've learned,this movie seems to be about a very chubby and very ugly monster that carries a crude scythe and can walk through walls that likes to kill and eat it's victims which consists of dumb blondes,drunks,and more dumb blondes.The origion of the Grim is never explained,the film's ""plot""is way too vauge,and the movie's ""special effects"" consists of orange-colored fake blood and the Grim's glowing red eyes..."
2,stay away from this!,"Geeze what a lame movie, the movie wasnt even scary and the creature looked almost like a imatation of ""Rawhead Rex"" only alot fake looking, i wouldnt waste your time or money on this peice of crap!"
1,this movie sucked!,worst movie ever. not scary. not even creative. the graphics of the creature was not great at all. the creature looks just like a piece of crap runned over twice. it sucks! if i could give it 0 stars i would.
4,Instead get the unabridged tapes of The Power of Now,"I only listened to 15 minutes of this set of tapes, but am so happy that I got the unabridged tapes of the author reading ""The Power of Now"" instead. This seemed to have little specific to add to the stunning material of ""The Power of Now."" It seems to be a mudily recorded lecture tape. ""The Power of Now"" is the single most helpful book on/of spiritual material that I have ever read. It is clear, pragmatic, concise and fills in gaps between other spiritual materials/traditions. It tops ""A Course in Miracles"". I eagerly await the companion workbook due out Oct 2001."
2,Disappointed,"The tapes do not add much to the fine book that Mr. Tolle wrote. I give his book 5 stars. It is wonderful, clear, concise and illuminating. A sense of peace seems to emanate from his words. I was expecting more of the same from the tapes; I didn't get it. I was hoping for elaboration and answers. When I read the book I formulated many questions in my mind that I would have liked to have answered. None of them were. As to elaboration, there is a bit concerning the pain body on tape 2, but not enough, and tape 1 is a rather inarticulate rehash of other material in the book. Mr Tolle's tone seems smug at times; it cast a slight negative shadow on my very positive impression of him and his work. I was very disappointed by the tapes.I am somewhat surprised by the other reviews which are so positive. I've only listened to the tapes once so maybe I'm judging them too harshly, on the other hand I have no desire to listen to them again."
4,Works like a Makita,"I was not disappointed with this little powerhouse. Does the job for most household repairs and bigger projects as well. Lightweight and with two batteries, a great deal."
5,good job,I havent used the product on an actual job. Tried it to see how it handled and feels and looks great....Great buy after comparison shopping..Amazon did a geat job/even though I went with the free savings shipping I got it in 2 days....Bought many items from Amazon and they are a great company to do business with...
5,Replacement Walkie Talkie Batteries,"Ordered these batteries on 3-05-10 and recieved them about a week later.I put them in the units and charged them over night and have been using them since without an additional re-charge.I use the Walkie Talkies about once a day for about 1/2 hour each time when I take my German Sheperd Dog out for walks and haven't had to charge them yet. The battery indicators on the units still show a full charge where the original batteries needed to be charged after each walk. I haven't charged them just to see how long they will go before running down. So far, So good.These batteries seem to be lasting longer than the originals that came with the units. According to the labels on the old and new batteries they are the same number and brand.The shipper has good and fast service and I will purchase from them again."
1,battery,battery did not work. it was tried in different devices and different chargers and was non-functional in all. e-mail to provider was not answered.
2,Uniden BP-38 GMRS/FMS radio batteries,"Uniden BP-38 GMRS/FMS radio batteries:These are the right type for my radios (yea!). Some of the stock seems stale. I ordered some of these and the date codes were 1-2 years old right out of the box. They seem to wear out every few years, for me. For comparison, I went to a national chain store and their stock was 2 years old and twice as much $$$.EDIT: I charged them fully. One of them dies after an hour of use (the one with the older date)."
3,Proud Mary,"I did not enjoy this movie. I think it was cheaply made. The movie makers need to add professional actors to authenicate the movies. I give this movie a 3 star, because of the efforts that was made, but not the quality of the movie."
3,the movie was ok but nothing to write home about,"the story line was good but it needed more work of the story development, delete some of the corny scenes, and add some more quality scenes to the story."
1,Draconian Policies,I have had terrible experiences with this company regarding their Draconian upgrade policies. I suggest you avoid this product and this company.
1,Reason for the Mix-Ups,"Just wanted to attempt to explain the mixups mentioned below, since we have received an order for this book by mistake. For some reason that is entirely unclear, Pop-O-Mania (published in 1997) seems to share the exact ISBN as Paul Ferris' 1977 biography of Dylan Thomas. Amazon's system has equated these two books and created a hybridized record for them (hence the 1977 publishing date and incorrect page count for Pop-O-Mania noted in the item details). We will be in touch with Amazon about the problem."
2,Too much hassle to stay working,"I bought this specifically because the description said it was a Toshiba brand product. What I received is not. That is not the issue, however. This is a two-part AC adapter where one part ""plugs into"" the transformer portion of the second part. The problem is that the parts do not stay connected well enough to keep the electrical current flowing. It takes too much finagling to get it to work in the first place, having to find just the right connection. Once found, a slight movement and no power flow to the laptop. I am currently trying to return this part as defective.That said, the original order process and delivery went well with Northparts, hence the two-star rating. I will update the review to let you know how the return process goes."
1,junk,TOTALY USELESS. AFTER 2 MONTHS THE PLUG BECAME NOT WORKING PROPERLY. I HAD TO GO TO RADIO SHACK AND BUY A NEW PLUG AND CONNECT TO CABLE.
1,Toshiba Power Cord,The cord frayed within the first 2 days of use. It is as big of a hunk of junk as the last one.
3,works o.k. so far,"After 3 years of use, my old one turned bad like what they said in reviews at Toshiba website. Any slight move of cable made power went off and that damaged my HD once. But still I prefer to use Toshiba rather than other substitutes.I don't yet have any problem with this new one so far and hope I won't. BTW, when I got the product, the seal was broken already. Not sure if they gave me the returned one but didn't wanna bother exchanging as I did need the power cable at that time."
5,Exactly the Right Adapter,"This adapter is perfect for my Toshiba Satellite laptop. No problems at all with ordering, receiving or using. Great service, definitely a recommended seller. Adapter has been working like a charm for over a month now & shows no signs of wear or any issues whatsoever."
3,Toshiba Power Adapter,I have purchased these products over and over and over ... I do not know why they burn out after about six months but they work great during those months
3,Good Watch for ~$50,"I've had my watch for one year; it replaced an Oakley D1 (my primary basis for comparison).PROs:+Large, easy-to-read dial+Great stopwatch. It allows you to stop and restart within the same lap. (Not possible with Oakley D1)+Good workout (stopwatch) memory and analysis features.+Very comfortable rubber band. The strap keeper is a good invention.+Durable watch body & face. Constructed of good materials (including mineral glass crystal).CONs:-Water leaked in and condenses on the inside of the crystal at times.-Alarm/Timer sound is VERY weak.-Does not allow simultaneous display of DAY and DATE during standard TIME function. You can choose for either DAY of the week (TUE, etc.) or MONTH and DAY (NOV 30, etc.)-It is too easy to toggle the sound/chirp on and off. I think this should be in the ADJUST mode so it is harder to change inadvertently.Overall, I think it's a good watch for ~$50."
3,Watch great/band bad,"Buying my third one of these, Its a great sailing watch with an easy to adjust countdown timer, my only complaint is that the band only lasts a year or so before the rubber tears from the watch face thus rendering the watch useless as there is no way to replace the band."
2,Great look but...,"Well, it looks great, big numbers on display, good size and cool design.My big complain it's about the fragility of the wristband. If you dont take good care, it will break! And an original Nike wristband it's too expensive, almost the price of a brand new watch.So, if you want a resistent watch so you can pratice lots of sports and activities, look for some other watches... maybe a G-Shock.. that's what I done!"
3,Good while it lasted,"I loved this watch.. until it drowned and went to watch heaven. I, like some who have reviewed this watch, made the assumption that ""H20 100M"" meant the watch was impervious to water. Well, I was wrong. I owned the watch for less than 2 years when on a recent trip to Cancun, condensation started forming inside the glass. I just brushed it off since it was fairly humid where I was. But when I decided to take a swim, it took its last breath and died. The watch was great when dry. I used the chronograph and timer many times plus the dual time was helpful traveling."
5,One FANTASTIC watch ... & a bargoon !!!,"Ok ... for starters, I paid $38.00 for this watch ... this watch locally is very hard to even find & retails for over $200.00 ... mine arrived from a retailer in NYC & I have to commend them on the extremely fast shipping & care in packaging this watch for USPS ... mine arrived in flawless condition. The dial is easy to read in extreme light conditions, super easy to set, & I was blown away by the fact it has two time zones, I do believe this little detail is omitted in the product description, or maybe I just didn't look hard enough, not matter. Folks gotta tell ya ... another product here on Amazon.com that deserves a solid 5 stars out of 5 stars. Nice job Nike, Amazon & hats off to Jomashop to filling the order."
3,"Excellent ideas, but somewhat lacking in development","Father Groeschel's presentation of ideas is sound and interesting, and the illustrations using incidents in the lives of people he has known a good approach. However, he tends to present some very intriguing concepts, then insufficiently develop them with clear explanations. For example, he refers to the Good Thief's conversation with Christ on the Cross as manipulative, but assumes the reader (who is unlikely to be a psychologist) will grasp why. The book is an excellent starting point, theologically solid and in accord with classic spirituality, but as a reader I found myself begging for more development and ideas about integration of the principles into one's own prayer life."
1,...unbelievably,"boring, annoying...dreadful. God knows I have tried to deal with this book, I've UNBELIEVABLY finish reading it and its the most worst book I've ever read. I never judge a book by its cover and believe me the cover art was bad, but I had faith in the work and it was disappointing.. ACK I will attempt to read this book ever."
1,Boring,"I don't know how anyone managed to get through this entire boring book. As an avid reader of vampire novels, I -tried- but it's just so lousily written and plotted that one can only assume she's related to the publisher somehow and that's why they decided to print it. A big yawn."
4,Pull Both Ends!!,"What a neat gadget. Small and compact but a tad short. It says right on the package to pull both ends at the same time; however, I was anxious to try it out and only pulled one side. The whole thing got tangled up and didn't retract propertly. It took me a bit to get it untangled but when I pulled BOTH ends as instructed it works slick!! Just follow the directions and you will love it as long as you are happy being stuck near the plug-in. Beats travelling with a bulky cord though."
2,"Good concept, but broke quickly","The idea is great -- a compact cable to keep in your bag for those places that don't have wireless internet.Unfortunately, on about the third use, the mechanism split apart inside this thing. I ended up just prying it apart and keeping the cable, as it's a nice slim cable, but not nearly as useful as it was when it was retractable.I wouldn't buy another one."
4,"Great design, but not durable.","I really really like the retraction mechanism on this particular Belkin model, so much so that I bought two.Actually I only got two because what tends to happen is that the plastic clips at the ends keep on losing their tension. What ultimately happened to my first one and is now happening to my second one is eventually you lose the ""click"" you get when inserting it into your laptop or PC. Then you have to basically either hold it in or just hope that it doesn't come loose. I really wish they made a more durable one. I would pay for it."
4,Good for netbooks,"I bought this cord because I work offshore and travel to many different rigs. Wireless isn't always an option and I needed an Ethernet cord to plug my netbook to the interwebz. I got the netbook for it's small package and ease of portability, and carrying around a 6 foot cable around would just ruin that. This cable it small and light, fitting perfectly into my netbook's case without adding to much bulk. The only two complaints I have with it are: it is a little short, which isn't a problem 99% of the time and the clip are a little small. It doesn't snap into my netbook's port and it's a little tuff to get it out of wall ports at times. Over all it's good though."
4,Handy cord in a pinch,"I needed an Ethernet cord that was compact and easy to carry around, and this fit the bill. The only drawbacks are the length of the extended cord and the connectors. It is rather short I'd say no longer than 3 feet. And the connectors don't seem like full RJ45's, they are shorter and a little harder to plug/unplug."
5,Great Product,"I am in law school and this is the perfect product for a student. It is great for portability and for quick connecting. The only drawback I would say is that it is a little short in length. I knew the length when I ordered it, but it could be a little bit longer and therefore could improve efficiency."
1,Defective,"Simply put, it came out of their box already broken. Not even once did the product work for me to use, and in addition I was charged to pay the shipping and handling for it to get replaced. While it's size is comparable to Belkin's other portable devices, each with a similar retractable concept for portability, many cases with their equipment breaks due to the sheer weakness in the method they use to bind the main part of the device with the rest of it. If this is the case then this is much better recommended if you do not use it on a regular basis, but instead need it for once in a while for when you need to connect one laptop to another via Ethernet cable. This item is subject to wear and tear and will break after constant use long before the warranty is up."
2,Glad I wasn't intending to use as intended,I opened the package carefully and tested the mechanism for this retractable cable. It broke on the first try. Part of the plastic inside snapped and the cable could not retract. Thankfully I planned on removing the cable from the housing for another purpose but be warned if you planned on using this often. I've used a similar type of retractable cable for audio cables and the like and they've lasted me more than a year.
2,Short cable and non-standard connectors,"The cable failed to work when connected to my HP laptop. After a couple of attempts with other devices and then a second attempt with the laptop and with some additional fiddling I was able to get it to connect.The connectors are a bit non-standard (shorter than usual) which I assume is why it didn't connect correctly and it also made it very difficult to disconnect as well (from deeper sockets).The retracting mechanism works very well, but the overall length (at 3 feet) is quite short for most applications. As an emergency cable in my bag it will suffice, but I would strongly encourage you to look at a longer cable and to consider other brands before buying..."
2,False advertising this item is shorter than described on Amazon,"After comparing brands and styles, and reading other reviews, I chose Belkin because I trust the product manufacturer. However, this item is only 36"" (3 ft) in length which means you must have your computer right next to the network jack - for a laptop that makes this cable completely worthless.Not bad product by Belkin - just untruthful advertising by vendor and Amazon."
2,"Slick design, superficial content","This book reads as though it were thrown together on a weekend. Much better value in other, more thorough massage books."
2,glossy well photographed but low on usability,"most of the effort here has gone into the design and photography, almost every massage tip is hard if not impossible to understand correctly.there are complex instructions which mean nothing, no diagram to explain what is meant, just a photo which doesnt tie in, you have to guess what is meant in nearly every example.this is not a good way to pick up massage techneques, picked up a few tips but overall disatisfied."
2,quick and sloppy massage tips,"I bought this book because it was less expensive than others on the market. Now I wish I had spent more money. While it does have some valuble information in it, it provides little in the way of comprehensive and holistic methodology; it's just very basic and step-by-step. While obviously geared toward the (future) professional, the stripped-down verbage and lack of imagination make it a mediocre sourcebook for anyone considering massage as a career. If you have NEVER ever thought about massage and are totally new to the concept, this would be helpful; otherwise, look for something bigger."
