4,healthy cooking,"An answer to my requirement for healthy cooking. I like the depth and size, just nice for fried rice for 3, steamed fish and stir fry vegetables. Cleaning is an ease, no need to worry about seasoning or rust. However, it takes longer time to heat up the cooking oil but I just love cooking in it. Great display on my oven top too."
1,Not worth its price,"Absolutely primitive book.not good for a novice or a seasoned trader.Each page is used to advertise author's other products like newsletter,softwares etc.Wishing to return the book but shipment back from india is costly,so keeping it."
2,Marketing material?,"I thought this title would be great seeing as how it was the only options book wrapped in plastic on the shelf. It's just ok. The secrets are more like ""nuggets"" of information and indeed, there is a bit of product hype in every secret."
1,worthless,"This is a worthless marketing material, you can learn more about options in 1 week reading free stuff online. Dan"
3,A scholarly look at the Twilight Zone disaster,"I expected much from this book but I found it was not as good as ""Outrageous Conduct"" which also dealt with the Twilight Zone disaster. ""Special Effects"" was a bit too scholarly and did not provide enough information on the participants."
4,An excellent foreign language film,This is a really interesting and beautifully shot film. The acting is suburb and the leading lady (Flora Martinez) as the femme fatale Rosario Tijeras is absolutely stunning. She has a lot of range and depth and hope to see more of her. Although it is very graphic in its sexuality and violence it still is a moving and emotional story. Recommended for film buffs and those enamored of Flora Martinez :)
3,Almost a classic,"First off, the camera work and cinematography is second to none. Even the premise itself is top of the line. Unfortunately, the execution of the story is what hurts this movie. We have flashback, after flashback, in one person's flashback, then somebody else's flashback, that the story gets muddled. Rosario is so hurt by her brother's death for almost half the movie, but the problem is, that her brother is not fleshed out enough, the filmmakers should have given the audience some emotion to connect with Rosario's emotion. There's just not enough about their relationship for the audience to care. But some of the images and camera angles just might be worth checking out this film."
2,my place of birth,"Found this film to portrait Colombia as violent, not like I remember it. there has always been violence, only not as in your face like this films shows. I'll give it one thumb up"
4,don't expect anything more than a list,I thought they're would be more than just lists of books. I was assuming they would put small snippets of what the books were about. great book if a list and price of what's out there is all you need.
3,Good Reference,"Tons of information if you need it on this topic. Provided lots of answers to my research. Even so seems like it could have been hundreds of pages longer. Lists need not be endless, though, I suppose."
5,A Must Read for armchair travelers,"A wonderful book about the scientific experience, although the author promises not to write anything of scientific value. Humerous, astonishing, exciting, touching and gripping are some of the best words to describe this story of scientists on a 2 year quest to explore unknown regions of the Amazonian basin. I re-read it often. My father knew one of the original explorers and I am lucky enough to know who the un-named emminent scientists were which gives it an added edge of enjoyment."
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased 2 cards at the same time. My 2 year old laptop would not recognize them. I tried my 3 year old desktop same thing. They did work in my three cameras and a digital picture frame. After too many times to count and trying numerous things with the desktop it finally recognized one card and I was able to transfer pictures both to and from the card. Then, I removed the card and reinserted. It did not recognize the card again. I tried for several hours before it recognized the card the first time. I did try both cards, same problem with both. I also in this process switched to different brands, they read every time. Maybe I received faulty ones? I don't know. I have never had any problems with any other brand of SD cards. I did not contact the company they would probably have made it right. Just my experience... Would I buy this brand again? NO! I don't think so. They did ship it very quickly...the shipping cost more than the cards. All around not what I expected."
2,Very Inconsistent,"I've used this flash for almost a year and a half. About every 4 pics I'll get a very underexposed (2 stops) one, causing me some critical missed shots. This has been very frustrating. I sent it in for ""service"" under warranty. Didn't help. I've experimented with 100s of pics and still have problems, even with all the settings exactly the same. Manual mode seems to work better, but who wants to bother every time I turn the flash on. After these experiences I am thinking about Canon ex430, more expensive, fewer features, but more consistent. Truth is the on camera flash (Digital Rebel) provides better pictures, with much less hassle. Another problem: eats batteries... I would NOT buy this again!"
4,A photo-newb's first flash unit...,"Recommend this unit vs. the 420EX b/c of its features and price range. Note: it doesn't have a lock for 45degree angle, only 90, 75, 60, and 0."
1,Still waiting,"I ordered a 500DG OVER A MONTH ago, and I am still waiting. WHen I checked the status (after a month, remember) it said it had not even been shipped yet. DON'T DO BUSINESS HERE>"
5,Compare to Canon EX 550/580,"Does everything the Canon EX 500 series can do, but for $200 less.I like to use all authentic Canon lenses and accessories. But when I saw this flash I was sold. I just used it on a 9-hour wedding job. It worked perfectly on the same batteries all day long. ETTL communication with my ""A Type"" EOS digital was perfect. Also works quite well as a slave unit.Definitely would recommend the Sigma EF 500 DG."
3,Well researched.,"A bit rambling. The reader needs to remember to check the dates at the top of each section, or can suddenly find himself confused by a sudden jump in time.I did read this one through, finding it interesting in the main, though with some quite bizarre incidents - the behaviour of the senior palace eunuchs with the young male servants? I don't think so!The reason I rated this 3 stars rather than 2, is the way that the eunuchs thought of the 'beards.' (whole men) It sounds just exactly what they might really have thought. eg, Zeno says on P145, 'Not for the first time, I wondered what it must be like to be attached to such an unruly member,' and 'The penis is a tail that wags the dog.'Worth reading if you're interested in books about eunuchs, but there are better ones out there."
5,Works Great..,"I love this item. It worked great. I used it in conjunction with my Christmas lights broadcasting music through FM. I've moved up to a better transmitter, but this is a good start."
2,Should change the name to Whole ROOM FM Transmitter,I was really excited about the possibilities of this product. I was looking for something that could broadcast my satellite radio to other rooms in my house but the Whole House FM Transmitter's range fell way short.
3,"OK, but I cannot be silent anymore.","Up until this point I have not written a review because I am such a huge Little House fan. When the first season came out I was REALLY happy! The DVDs were great and the BEST part was that I saw a lot of extra uncut scenes!! But, with the next season there were NO uncut scenes. Both this fact and the decrease in quality with each additional release make me somewhat disappointed. Each time I wonder if I should purchase the next season. It looks like they are not paying attention to detail and not going the extra mile by putting the uncut scenes and extras we are used to on DVDs (that is why they cost more than VHS right?). Oh well..."
4,Great Stories...video quality lacking,"The episodes were great. The humor, love, tears, empaty, were all there in episodes I re-lived, some of which I had forgotton or not seen . Not to be missed, a real family series and maybe an ""education"" for youth today who see so much action without meaning.....this could change their minds.However, the DVD video quality seems to have less resolution than the previous DVD's of series 1-3, it seems a little ""fuzzy"" on the same screens compared to the previous ones. Doesn't bother my wife....its just that I noticed it and compared it with a seasons 3 set."
1,Horrible Video Quality...,"I have Seasons 1-4 right now... One and Two were not good... Three a little better but Season 4 is the worst in video quality of them all so far. If I had recorded this on tape years and years ago, I could have transfered it to DVD myself and achieved a better end result. It is fuzzy... Out door scenes are always washed out... sometimes the color changes right before your eyes... and the cuts that used to be there for commercials chops off as though it has been trimmed and trimmed until now the cuts are too soon amking them horrible transitions... The problem is as long as we keep buying them the manufacturer is NOT GOING TO MAKE THEM ANY BETTER."
2,unacceptable cuts !!,"I just CANNOT understand why all episodes have cuts, especially at crucial moments - just an example, in the last episode -I'll be waiving.. part I - Charles and Mary come back from town after second eye visit, and right after they've parked, there are some very touching minutes where Pa tells Mum about the curse bound to happen to Mary : the whole scene has been cut !!- What on earth are a few minutes on a DVD layer ??! Please explain ! I have another example in mind : in season 5, ""Fagin"" episode you will NOT be able to see the scene where Albert asks Charles the permission to call him ""Pa"" !! Only when Laura asks Albert after she hears him say the word, will we learn with her that he was entitled to do it ! Is there a reason to not respect the original cut ? Enjoy anyway..."
4,"Great Show, Editing Seems Like A Rush Job","Some shows aren't as good as the years go on, but Little House season 4 is just as good as the first season. Story lines are fresh and each show is well-acted. The only annoying thing about the Little House DVDs is the cutting off of scenes. There isn't a smooth ending and beginning of some scenes. They seem to begin and end apbruptly, as though the editors were in a hurry to get the DVD out. Except for that, the series is well worth the purchase."
4,LHOTP Season 4,Bought this for my daughters (8 & 10). They love it and rewatch it often. On to Season 5.
5,Keep them coming!,"I also grew up watching the Little House series including the later ones called The Little House Years which until recently, was carried by TBS. The entire series is shown in out of order episodes, sometimes showing part two with no part one or one without two. It's great to finally be able to collect the entire series on DVD to keep. Sure, the video could be better but film fades over the years and is very expensive to restore. A perfect example is Pollyanna by Disney. They have a review that shows how the film was and what they had to do to restore it. A very big job indeed!"
2,A good show ruined by a poor quality dvd.,"I give the actual content in season 4 a four star review but the dvd quality is so poor I cannot recommend anyone to buy this dvd. I am normally not very picky about dvd quality. I usually have the opinion of ""good enough for me.""But the sound quality on this set is so terrible that it drove me crazy all the while I was watching it. The picture quality is not that great but I could deal with it. But the sound many times faded in and out and there was a lot of static."
3,"Shipping was great, product wasn't","I was so excited to receive this in the mail. However, so many episodes aren't watchable because the disks are scratched. I don't understand how this happens with something that was purchased new."
1,Putting my foot down..holding off buying,"I have purchased the first two seasons and based on what I have read about the seasons 3 and 4, can see nothing has changed. What a huge shame that this wonderful show got stuck with an uncaring company releasing its DVDs. As a polar opposite, check out the DVD release for Freaks & Geeks (one of the few recent shows worthy of being mentioned with LHOP) and see what a true DVD package should look like. Hours of extra features, and extreme care paid to both DVD presentation as well as picture quality. I truly hope another company can just come in and re-release all the seasons. I know I would write off the earlier purchases and just buy the superior DVDs out of loyalty to the show. My guess is that many others would do that as well. It would be a great way to let companies know that they can't get away with releasing inferior products. Maybe someone should start an online petition."
5,5 STAR Rating,The product was exactly as described and the ship date was as promised. I would definitely use them again for future orders.
5,RIQUISIMO!!,"I am definitely a huge fan of Ketama and Antonio Carmona and own all they've done. This was a late addition to my collection and I find myself playing it over and over. Not only does it have rich and vibrant remixes of some of the great Ketama songs, it contains collaborations with an interesting and diverse selection of other artists, too. The duet in ""La Ola"" with Inma Serrano is especially sweet. My advice? Buy it, put it on with the best speakers that you have and turn it UP--it rocks!"
4,sabor ketama,"This album explore diferents sounds mix with flamengo ,like Arab, African and Bossa Nova.Is a good experience."
1,Horrible!,"Habia escuchado alguna cosa antes de ketama y por eso escuché este CD. Es horroroso, no me gusto nada. Alguna versión ""traducida"" es mas bién IMPERDONABLE, casi diria que deberia ser considerada delito. En definitiva, piensatelo 2 veces antes de comprar este CD..."
3,Viva Mazzola!,"Not for punctilious score-followers: there are passages of tempo confusion and ensembles not quite together. With all that, Denia Mazzola makes this hard to pass up with her thrilling, risk-taking,sometimes rough-hewn vocalism. Giuseppe Morino is a vibrant Edgardo in this 1989 live performance."
1,Spend a bit more for a better pan...,"This pan would be OK in a fix, but if you plan on baking this size cake more than once, it's definitely worth spending a little bit more for a commercial grade pan. Commercial pans will have straight sides and corners, and will be made of much thicker alluminum. I bought this pan from a local store for a last minute cake, and it warped slightly in the oven while the cake was baking, resulting in an uneven cake. I have several other larger pans made by Magic Line, and the quality is much higher."
5,Saved my life!,"I'm a Graphic Design major and when I entered this class and discovered that I was expected to learn Flash, I was a bit hesitant. Luckily, the teacher mentioned this book, for when I tried to follow the teacher, I constantly got lost. Fed up, I got this book and it SAVED MY LIFE!! I loved the simplicity of this book-- direct, to the point, helpful pointers alongside pictures. It teaches you the very basics and useful tricks and such. This is a must for anyone who needs help!"
3,Great for absolute beginners,"If you have never even opened Flash, then this is a great step-by-step tutorial book. The bad thing about this book is that 90% of it just duplicates what's freely available in the Flash help files. The bottom line: it illuminates (what should be) obvious!"
2,Not worth the money,"This book looks good at first, but once you are done, you feel ripped off. I found it quite a letdown, and ended up purchasing the Flash 5 bible for only a few dollars more. That still wasn't great, but contained a WEALTH of information compared to Hands On Training. I will never waste my money on any of her books again, as now I have learned there are much better books to be obtained."
3,Not Very Hot! More Like Luke Warm!,"This book is like eating chinese food, because it leaves you hungry after every chapter. I have bought other ""HOT"" books and liked them much better, but I am starting to feel that perhaps this series could benefit by building in more exercises that will help the learner gain more confidence and experience. Yes, I was able to go through this book in about 2 weeks, but I now feel the need to either take a course somewhere or find another book that will satisfy my needs (and appetite for knowledge)."
2,Stuffy translation,"This translation of Dante's Il Convivo is called ""Il Convito,"" Why? Also, while it has the distinction of being the first English tranlation, which is impressive, it also dates from 1887, which means that the English is quite stuffy. I will look for a more modern translation."
4,fun but missing the baby!!,"I recently bought this toy for my 2 year old niece's bday; she loves it but.. the center did not include a doll!! I was led to believe it did, the pictures show the baby dol and there is no mention of it not being included, the info should say it.. my niece still loved it, used her stuffed animals with it and is very busy all day..Overall,I think it works very well."
3,not very durable!!!,"I bought this for my daughter at Christmas and she recently started playing with it (she is almost two). She seems interested in it, but the parts keep coming off. The baby bottle and the soap container are destroyed with tooth marks. The mobile comes off with a tap of your hand. None of the pieces seem to stay on. It's a great concept, but they need to improve the quality!!"
5,Great nursery center for the price,"My daughter recieved this toy for her second birthday and plays with it almost everyday. I did not want to pay alot of money for toy I wasn't sure if she was big enough for and I am so glad that I went with this one.Some of the other reviewers complained about the mobile and highchair coming off but my daughter loves the fact that if her babies ""don't want"" to look at the mobile she can remove it.This toy has also lasted through many visits from my 1 and 2 1/2 year old nephews (they are both very rough with toys).I would highly recommend this nursery to anyone in the market for a place to bathe, feed and put to bed their child's dolls."
5,Hard to find now!,"I saw this adorable nursery online, but it is currently unavailable. I e-mailed Toys R Us directly through www.toysrusinc.com about locating one. A customer service person called me a few days later to tell me he had located one in one of my area stores. He put it on hold for me and I was able to pick it up the next day. I was so impressed with the customer service! The nursery is really a good value for $29.99. My two year old is going to love it! Good luck finding one if you are still looking! Hope this information helps."
3,Fun for a few days,The toy was fun for a few days until my 3 year old decided to take it apart and distroy it.
3,Disappointing,"While my daughter was estatic to receive this toy for a gift, it did not turn out to be much fun for anyone! It was quick to put together and had all the essential stations for a ""nursery"", but it fell apart over and over again. We finally tossed the whole set in the garbage after the mobile fell apart, the highchair would no longer stay on and the rail from the crib had fallen off so many times it had finally become lost. The only postive I can find in this center is that the cabinet doors that were on the earlier model appear to have been removed by the manufacturer. Lucky thing...because they fell off everytime they were opened and closed!! I would ONLY consider purchasing this toy if the little girl playing with it can be extremely gentle with her toys (and there was no brother around!!!)."
1,Cheap and dengerous,This Nursery Center looks nice but it is made from real cheap plastic that breaks and has very sharp edges. Do not recommend at all.
4,Great toy!,"My 3 yr.old got this for a christmas gift and she loves it! I thougth it was missing pieces but I quess they were removed by the manufactor by reading one of the other reviews here I found that out. I would have liked the doors. Had no problems, very durable, no complaints here."
1,Waste of money,"Forget extended warranties. You can get an ""all peril"" personal articles insurance policy from State Farm for about $30 a year that covers your camera if it is lost, stolen, rained on, dropped, left on a bus, eaten by the family dog, whatever. Other insurance companies probably offer the same thing. I have all of my camera equipment (video, digital, stills, tripods, accessories, etc.) and laptop computer covered on one of these for $30 per year. They'll pay to fix or if it can't be fixed, to replace with ""like kind and quality""."
1,Mack Camera Warranty on Sony Z1U video camera,"UPDATE August 28thI called and got a wonderfully helpful woman on the phone. She promised she would find out how things were going and she did. They were just slowed down because so many people were on vacation. My camera was finished the next week and retuned very quickly. It works great. I am impressed.August 23thI am getting quite nervous about how MackCamera is going to perform. I sent my video camera in on July 23rd and now, 21 business days later it, according to their online repair status, is still ""waiting in line for a technician."" Their web lists the estimated time for repair at 10 to 15 business days.I've seen a lot of horror stories in forums about them and have emailed for a true status check. So far, a week later, no reply. I have now left a voice mail message and sent another email (August 21). I have tried to get a human on the phone, but so far no luck.Shaking in San Diego.Alex Farnsley[...]"
2,"Er, is this Chinese colonial exploitation?","Miss Zhu Zheqin is back wearing ethnic rags on the cover. Sorry to be a wet blanket but, wouldn't it be nice to hear some real Tibetan music by a real Tibetan?The best comment on this CD is probably that by Beijing rock guru and DJ Zhang Youdai back in May 1998 who compared Sister Drum with ""Buying a Tibetan knife and hanging it on your wall. It may look good, but it doesn't ensure the slightest understanding of Tibet"""
4,"take care, not too much :,,,","very no Chinese even attempted this, more Coltrane than Miles Davis, not at all Jpana, no digiry do and I don't think we ever going to have to: another reason that the Neumann M150 should be outlawed to any NPR station, public or private, next time, bring somebody, King of Swede` RFI Yo!"
2,Disappointing.,"The format of this book is well laid out and provides a good snapshot of Belarus. Unfortunately, it is out of date by some 2 to 3 years. It is especially terrible when the picture depicting the national flag is incorrect. Over all. I do not recommend this book."
5,"Are you...AWAKE now, backseat warmongers?","Sister Ortiz account makes tears flow; the truth of her suffering makes folks strviing to become fully human think to our current situation...to the warmaking reality we allow, and the inevtiable suffering of innocents that ALWAYTS springs from it.Reading Ortiz makes you say, OUT LOUD ""Never again."" Ortiz makes you get up, call your representatives, and tell them that you are going to be a CITIZEN, and demand of them an end to what Ortiz calls ""The ominous silence"" surrounding torture and warmaking activity and all that accompanies them...Are you awake, and aware, now all you backseat warmongers?You're warmaking has always made me sick. Sister Ortiz' ordeal makes me overwhlemingly sad."
4,A very moving book,"A nice book worth reading. It enshrines all the hot button issues that affect our modern society, namely:Domestic strife, civil war, international politics, torture, abortion, government engagement in atrocities, friendship, psychological problems and many more thematic issues that are indispensable."
3,Thanks Sister Ortiz,"Thanks for sharing your painfull story, It is a must read for ALL americans to see what we have been doing in other places in the world."
3,A wounded woman,"The true horrors of torture are apparent more in the way this book is composed than in what it says. Her experiences have manifestly left Ortiz unable to live except in relation to them. As it turns out, for example, she has apparently abandoned her deep commitment to working with children; instead, she presents herself as entirely devoted to keeping her cause alive: adding new information when it lags, pulling back when it might be settled. She expresses concern for the tens of thousands of Guatemalan victims of oppression, but in the book only speaks intimately with one--a murdered man she never met, someone else's husband. The men she calls possessively ""my torturers"" continue to fill her life, more consistently than all those who have obviously tried to offer her whatever, perhaps inadequate, help they could; many of these she feels have betrayed her. It is the excrutiating portrait of a person destroyed."
3,THE COLLAPSE OF BARINGS,"I have bought this book with the intention of reading it slowly during the coming summer, and then deciding on whether I will make it a Complusory Reading text for my Banking Regulation students at The University of Malta. Meanehile however Amazon have been excellent in getting the book to me on time."
3,Eh,"I absolutely love Savannah, GA and am in the process of reading every book available about her history, her hauntings, the people etc... so when I came across the book I was absolutely enthusiastic to learn it had over 70 stories. This book would have gotten 5 stars from me if some of the stories didn't sound repetitive/similar from the others in the book and it just didn't really give me a good feel of what I thought I'd be reading. There were about 6 stories in there that I really did find fascinating and was glad to have read but overall I found myself bored reading it and looked forward to finishing the book. So ... overall it's an okay read but I've read better for sure. Don't get your hopes up if you're looking to be spooked let alone an in depth history."
1,shame on the label,"The mastering on this CD is so bad, it's painful to listen to. The release location for this is listed as Miami, and it sounds like it's an amateur bootleg, transferred to cd by someone without the slightest amount of care for the music, or skill with the equipment. There are releases form the 20's that sound better than this; heck there are salvages off wax cylinder that sound better.That is a shame, as Estrellas Cubanas delivers some of superb charanga descargas.Here's hoping a legit label releases albums form this excellent but neglected band."
3,"Good, not perfect.","These pedals look pretty classy on your car, but watch out for a few of these things:-""Green"" is when they're off, turned on they're actually closer to turquoise.-Install is by no means easy. Depending on your stock pedals it could take some work to get these in. My clutch was easy just bolt it on, but my brake and accelerator took a lot more effort and creative use of nylon tie wraps to make it work.-They emit a high-pitched whine when they're on, but not too loud; a good stereo will cover it up."
4,Delightful,"I really enjoyed this book. I did find a few typing errors, but those are easily fixed. This story shows the struggle of a forced marriage, and that fact that sometimes when you let go of the past, you can enjoy the future. The passion between Rannulf and Rowena grows with each chapter and I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed this story.There was a bit of everything here. Family drama, passion, jealousy, and lots of plot! It was a thoroughly good historical romance."
2,Easy but predictable,"Easy reading, but way too predictable. Seemed a bit repetative at times. I did enjoy the character development of his brothers relationship with Lady Wren. It gave it a hit more depth."
3,"Left a lot to be desired, like a finished ending....","I wanted to love this book but it fell short in a lot of areas. The hero is, as others have said, a hardly redeemable abusive jerk who suddenly changes. The book lacked character development. The dialogue was extremely flat. The setting was interesting but not described that well. The ending of the book leaves so many unchecked boxes. Overall I wanted to like this book but it just left a lot of be desired."
1,Left hanging!,I was so into the book but when it got to 62% it stopped and there was nothing else - the book then went to 100% !!! I was left hanging and felt robbed as I started to read this last night and well into the morning and when it finally almost got to the end I cannot find out what happened!! I would gladly buy it if I am able to finish reading the story! This really sucks and this is the first time I encountered this!
2,Way too Much Bickering!,"Omg, the two main characters spend the entire book bickering and fighting! I swear I wanted to give up reading the story because it was so depressing every time I turned on my kindle to read that they were fighting again! (Except when they are in the sack, then they are passionate and nice). Anyway the story had a good premise, but the constant fighting was a definite downer."
4,Really good!,I love books like this. I loved her characters and the history of it. good ending and I would definitely recommend. I look forward to reading more of Denise's books!
4,"very good, would've paid to read",This was a very well written love story. I look forward to reading more of this family. It built to the end very well and had interesting characters.
5,A must to read,I am not good at describing but I am very happy with this book! I really love the length of the book and there was some places in the book that I thought was the end but it didn't :) so I am going to order an actual book so I can have it on hand so I can reread it whenever. I literally could not but my phone down (I have the kindle app)
5,a historical worth reading,A must read for all of those who long to catch a glimpse into the medieval days. A great well thought out plot and story line that follows the struggle of the Lady Rowena trying to manage what life has given her as best as her circumstances allow. I loved following along and seeing her spirit. This is a must read.
4,Excellent research,"I love historical fiction. These days it's quite a trend, so I often download ""historical"" freebies that I immediately delete from my account because they are actually botched Cinderella tales.I've been surprised, instead, by the accuracy of the historical research provided for this book. The author describes wonderfully the environment and the life of a medieval country hall, so vividly that you can see it before your eyes.Her style reminds me of Ariana Franklin (a.k.a. Diana Norman), one of my favourite writers of all times - and she was an historian...Please, don't miss this small jewel of a book, and I think many of you will end - as I did - downloading the other four book in this series. Enjoy."
4,wINTERS HEAT,AGAIN A GOOD HISTORICAL ROMANCE OF WHICH I AM PARTIAL TO READING I WILL READ MORE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR IN THE FUTURE
5,Fear and loathing in Graistan,"After being ripped from a convent, Rowena is forced to marry a Lord. Her mother loathes her, her father has no care for her but unlike some of the heroines in these types of novels, Rowena decides early on to be the best wife she can possibly be. She does her best to honor and serve Lord Rannulf. She proves to be smart, well read, learned and witty. Rannulf on the other hand resists falling for Rowena. He has been burned by women before. He has burried two wifes already. He is afraid of love and fights it every step of the way.Somehow, I still haven't figured out how, I have read these novels out of sequence. Which has really been kind of a cool thing. I love this series. The way the author presents the details, you can actually smell and feel the enviornment. She does a great job."
3,Less anger anger more romance,There was so much anger it made the story difficult to enjoy. I usually enjoy historical romance but it was difficult to follow and could have used more editing.
4,Great book,"Liked the book, and the series. Really enjoyed the fast paced reading. The book has a good flow and makes you look forward to finding out what happens next."
2,"romance novel, not historical","This story could be placed in any time period or setting. It does not come close to a Penman, Gregory or Chadwick historical novel. It is purely a romance fantasy novel."
5,Medieval romance,"Great story well written. This brings to life a period of history of which I know little. Apart from a good romance, there is a real feeling for the period. The book is filled with fascinating details on dress, homes and work without feeling at all preachy. You can almost smell the castle, a true sign of a well written book. Great characters although if I had to find a flaw, Rannulf is a bit unsympathetic and I teetered on the edge of believing his motivation. However, as you are transported into another era, his character becomes clearer. Men are simpler and life more elemental. Definitely worth reading."
3,Good writing style,"This author is a good writer. I really enjoy reading books written by people skilled at drawing the reader into the storyline as though they are part of the book. This author is successful in doing this. With that being said, I don't like hero's that are lavishly stubborn to the harm of others. The heroine apprised him of the severe wrongs committed but the hero refused to listen. Even though she gave him names of those he could get visual confirmation from and his brothers corroborated and supported her report, he would not hear to the harm of his marriage and people. This evidences stupidity which is something I personally do not like in a book. I prefer hero's who are strong, smart, and just. For this reason I am giving it 3 stars."
2,not worth it,"I didn't like the way it comes out, I would rather have a powder dry shampoo, it didn't really work like i expected it to"
5,No more eau de dog,"Bravo, Paul Mitchell! My 65 pound black Lab mix used to be brown and smelly due to the dirty dog run. But now she has glossy black fur, and smells like cherry almond. She HATES baths, so this was life changing for me. The cats (bath haters, too) both love it. Which is rareFor those finicky felines. Three paws (and one thumb) up!"
1,Difficult to use,"I bought this for those times in between bathes. The foam tends to glob onto the fur and is not easy to spread evenly. Smell is okay, but I gave up on this product and went back to something with a more liquid consistency."
2,Subpar,"I realize this book was written in 1986 before the advent of computerized charting.. thus the only reason it wasn't a 1 star. Weintraub magically calculates the pivot, R1, R2, S1, S2 numbers without ever mentioning that they were floor pivots and seemingly takes credit for their value. He then uses a moving average based on average price on 20 min bars for ""Day 1"" , and then a continued moving average for ""Day 1 + Day 2"". When Day 1 approaches or crosses Day 2's MA .. then you look to trade. This is where it becomes vague, as you are somehow supposed to determine market direction from these lines and their relation to the floor pivot levels. Sure, somebody might find this useful and figure out some patterns.. but this is going to be useless trading information for most."
1,Less than 1 Star,"I am amazed that the observations the author makes are even worthy the paper they are printed upon. Ther were no starling revelations and the few ideas that were off handedly mentioned and treated as original were merely the smae as those espused by others only more effectively, clearly and earlier than this author. I lament that I even oiffered this author an opportunity to oresent to an audience in Chucago who were basically to hear me speak and the author was a secondary on the program. I am emarrassed for the author."
1,Just a waste of words,"Like the other book by this same author, not only was I disappointed but again I feel that I was taken since I wasted the time to even attempt to read it. My time is valuable and Weintraub knows that I can program anything and that I am the industry's premier critic. I can see through his hype. Rather than waste time on this jibberish read a good book on programming and try programming your own techniques. Weintraub is the second coming of Ken Roberts."
4,"Great DVD, but....","This is a really odd, but neat little piece of animation. I've managed to catch it once or twice on TV, and liked it enough that I decided to get the DVD to watch all the episodes.Seeing as how I just opened my copy, I can't really say too much about the program itself, although it looks and sounds pretty good.My complaint is the opening. There are a number of previews (ads) before the main program. You either have to fast forward through them or watch them, before you get to the main menu. Each and every time you put the disc in and play it. You can't just hit the chapter skip button and go through them. What gives? That's the only reason this disc doesn't get 5 stars."
2,No so crazy about this one.,"I bought this BP monitor as a just-in-case item for the camp we do. I've tried it several times. It doesn't give a reading about half the time. Some of the readings it does give don't seem that accurate or consistent. I work in a hospital around that best equipment of this kind and I know how they work. This one is probably more trouble than it's worth. Of course, since I only paid about $20 for it... readings half the time may be acceptable. I've since found an Omron cuff machine that works much better."
4,good but battery cover is loose,"i liked it but as another reviewer mentioned, the battery cover is loose....otherwise works fine"
2,Mark of Fitness MF-78 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,I am very disappointed in the quality of this machine. The velcro wore out after only two or three readings. I have to hold it on.
4,interesting premise,"Mr. Read writes well, as per usual, and his plot device has the gravity to engage the reader to the end. Well conceived."
3,A good read,"Whether you are a believer or not, this is certainly a page-turner written with style. Careful plotting and mostly credible characters kept my interest throughout.It is a deeply Catholic novel, which did't put me off but, as an atheist, didn't convert me either. The major implausiblility in the book, for me, was the conversion of a militant athiest by what I imagine Catholics would call ""the divine spirit"" or similar. Sorry, I found this bit laughable. The only other blemish in the book is a faint whiff of anti-semitism. But still well worth a read."
3,More from less,For a fairly low budget film I found this well done and quite interesting. I would rent it rather than buy.
3,Disappointed a few people,"Typical category 3 Hong King erotica. Lots of nudity and little else; this is pretty much run-of-the-mill stuff. Not great, not awful."
4,Saint Anthony Medal/Silver Finish.,"I sent it out as a gift and only hope that it was really liked by it's reciever. You never really know if your gifts are liked as much as you liked giving it to them.Happy with the seller and his crew, good service.."
5,The British Library Guide To Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques,"This book is a wonderful introduction to the history and process of medieval manuscripts and manuscript illuminations. There may be few words in comparison to other books, but this book for certain does not have any wasted words. What is especially pleasant in this book are the many color plates and even more black and white (gray scale). These images are strategically laid out and matched to the text, allowing the illuminated manuscripts themselves complete what is lacking in text. Considering the price and number of color pictures, this book is a great deal. Even without necessarily reading it again, I will return to it many times just to relish in the illuminations themselves. For these reasons and more I give this book a 5 star rating."
5,It's a great CD !,I'm from the USA and I was on vacation in Australia when I bought this CD and I think it's a great CD. I just wish I would have bought more of his CD's when I was there. I listen to this CD real often.
2,Last song cut short,"I gave 2 star for this CD not because of the musical quality...but because the last song ""Goodnight My Love"" is cut short on this CD.After watching the live performance on cable, I rushed out to buy this CD, labeled by Hybrid. Only to find out my favorite song ""Goodnight My Love"" was cut short. On the CD, it ends with the sax doing a solo then fades away....which leaves the song dangling and unfinished!!! On the video, this song ends with Art singing ""bring you closer to me"" and the music slowly ends beautifully, correctly.There's a version out which was released by Sony in 2003. I don't know if this version contains the full song.The Hybrid Label version is simply ridiculous!!! How can you possibly end such a beautiful song short!! leaving it unfinished....and well....SHORT and listeners wanting more!!!If someone can verify if the Sony conatins the full ""Goodnight My Love""...or tell me where I can get this verson, would really appreciate it."
5,great,"I never tire of Art Furfunkel and his energy and spirit I hear when I listen to him. He is a great artist who stays connected to a reality that touches the mind and heart, love, joy and sorrow. He connetcs to the ethos of the spirit."
3,did the trick,"nice cheap boots, they are water proof to an extent but they arent so comfortable ad they are loud, but not bad for looks"
1,not real,"thought i was ordering a decent pair of cheap cowboy boots, but really got a costume style not satisfied at all"
5,Awesome!!!,"I bought my Rockford Fosgate RFX9300 source unit around June of 2000 for $1200. I wanted to get the CD changer too but didn't have the additional $500 they were going for at the time. By the time I had the extra cash, Rockford Fosgate had unfortunately stopped making source units and the CD changers. Then in February 2009 I found the CD changer on Amazon for $55. I bought one right away and installed it. Jump ahead to 2012 and everything still works like it was brand new. If you have one of the old Rockford Fosgate source units and are looking for a CD changer, don't hesitate. Mine came brand new, sealed, like it had just left the factory."
5,Joyce does it again!,"This book is a must for all those who claim to be a follower of Christ, and not just those in leadership, or thinking of being in leadership! It speaks of the integrity of heart that we should all have and display."
1,Side came unstitched instantly; legs come unbraided,"Our dog played with this about 2 minutes before the side stitching popped open and a leg fell out (or we just didn't look carefully when we bought it). On the other side, one of the braids had already come undone. Better make a good inspection before you hand it over to your dog - and keep checking. Ours is an 11-year-old minpin that still has his Lion King from a McDonald's Happy Meal that he got when he was just a puppy. He's not hard on toys. Tried to stitch it back up, but it takes a sewing machine to stuff the leg back in and seal the sides. We'll see how that goes. It does look very cute, but one star may be too much from a quality and safety standpoint."
2,Not for big dogs... won't last long!,"While it's a cute little toy for a dog with small teeth, it doesn't last long in a house with one or more big dogs. I think the thing lasted about 15 minutes before there was stuffing everywhere..."
5,The Farm Dogs are back with some new licks!,"FARM DOGS is: Bernie Taupin, Tony Brock, Jim Cregan, Robin Le Mesurier, and Tad Wadhams.Hot off the success of their groundbreaking debut album, Last Stand in Open Country, the Farm Dogs follow up, Immigrant Sons, displays the natural progression of their music. Taupin's lyrics are the brush strokes on the canvas created by the flawless, stinging instrumentation and background vocals provided by Cregan and Le Mesurier (both formerly of Rod Stewart's band), Brock, and Wadhams. Once again, co-producer David Cole (formerly worked with Bob Seger, Poco, Tina Turner, Steve Miller) has provided the catalyst that hones these songs to perfection without an overbearing hand.Collectively, these songs pick up where the best days of groups like the Eagles left off. If you enjoyed their debut, wait until you hear this one! And if you get the chance to catch the Farm Dogs in concert, you're in for a real treat!"
3,"not a bad one, but....","According to its name, ""toilet bowl brushes & holders"", I should get one set of something, but I just got a brush. So, a little disspointed..................Anyway, the brush is ok at least."
5,Great for metal picture frames,"I put this on my table saw as soon as it arrived. Within minutes I was cutting aluminum picture frame stock to size. Very nice finish to the saw cut. I did not have to touch up the surfaces at all. I put the 8"" blade on my 10"" saw. Highly recommend."
3,Professionally speaking...,"Been a big fan since the show first aired, and a radio broadcaster since 1972. Sound leveling is needed, as some cues are loud enough to shock the viewer. Drowning out dialogue is also troubling. The unfortunate need for replacements is recognized but rule one should be low volume on the replacement cues and try leaving some out completely. They were an annoying distraction in ""Not With a Wimper"" and I fear things will get worse the further I go. If the final two episodes are changed in any way it will be a travesty. Please, just leave some out. There's no excuse for poor mixing."
1,"If you Can't Do It Right, Don't Do It At All",That's pretty much all I have to say about what CBS/Paramount did to THE FUGITIVE series.
1,Putting classic TV on a pedestal- and covering it with garbage,"Mr. Dahl's review is most informative and accurate. I'd refer those who would like to know the details of this artistic abortion to his comments. My review, such as it is, is to balance the odd number of positive reviews given such a piece of hackwork."
5,"The Fugitive:Season Three,Vol.2",This is my favorite TV show of all time. I hope to obtain the complete series for my collection. Awesome series.
2,Barely adequate..if that.,"Basically, a strip down & reassembly guide. diagnostics sketchy..As an example: I'm doing chain & sprocket replacement. The book tells how to dissassemble sprockets, but there's no info on cutting the chain, fitting the replacement chain clip/master link.I haven't seen the Haynes manual so I don't know if it's any better."
2,frustrating book,"I have purchased three books in this series and they all suffer from the same flaw. Not enough specfic detail. Perhaps these books are not intended to be 'how to' books, in which case they make great browsing for a non-builder. However a builder looking for information will find the books hint more than they explain. Two examples are references to custom paint mixes with no mention of the formula or paints used, and reference to modifying the Tamiya kit's tail with no detail about where or what to cut or reshape. Perhaps these details are obvious to some but then would these people be the target audience for these books? In the end I came away greatly impressed with the modelling skills of the author but with very little specific knowledge to help improve my own skills."
2,makes me nauseous,"For some reason, whenever I take the One-A-Day Maximum Vitamins, I feel nauseous. It's not an extemely acute feeling, but rather a mild feeling of discomfort, regardless of whether I take them on a full or empty stomach. Also, if you can't take large pills, these might be too big for you. (..)"
4,Hunter Ceiling Fan - Great Price,"This is a decent fan. It makes a little noise on the high setting, but it may be caused by the installation. Other than that, we got a GREAT price on this item through Amazon. It was almost half the price that was advertised in other stores."
1,Not As Advertised,"After a lot of research on Amazon (and other sites) I purchased six of these fans to place across my covered patio. I chose these because of their advertising that they were outside, weather proof fans. After a couple months the blades snapped off one of the fans during a 15 to 20 mph wind. I went to Amazon to order parts but none were available so I purchased the 7th fan to use for parts.Since that time, every time the wind blows more than 15 to 20 mph, the fans come apart. The arms that hold the blades on are made of a very flimsy metal looking product that simple is not strong enough to handle the wind. Of course, when the arms break and the blade falls, the blade breaks because it is made of a somewhat brittle plastic.These are not ourdoor fans by any stretch of the imagination."
4,Love it but hasn't worked since power washing porch,Looks beautiful and worked great until we had porch power washed. Could be just the electrical connection and not the fan itself. Would think being an indoor/outdoor it would be sealed enough not to let water effect it.
5,Nice Shocks!,I bought these along with the 5479's to replace the original shocks on our '98 GMC 3/4ton 4x4. They worked perfectly to maintain ride height and ride quality. Gotta like that lifetime warrenty too!
2,It's fun while it last - product has short shelf life,"I bought the MovieTime projector and fortunately the first time it broke down it was under warranty. Unfortunately the company returned the projector without solving the problem. I returned it and the company kindly replaced the entire projector. One year later, after vey little use, the new projector broke down, leading me to believe the product is a real lemon. Repairs are a racket too since the company will not share the schematics. You have to pay them $160 to have them look at their faulty equipment and then replacement parts cost over $600. I give it two stars because the projector is fun while it lasts but I would advise against buying this money pit. I have never written a review but I feel compelled to warn potential buyers since the initial cost of purchase is high."
3,Not recommended,"The built in DVD player and speakers are good and very practical, which makes it a good unit overall. The problems are:1) The resolution could be a little better. This 800x600 doesn't match my needs anymore.2) It doesn't come with a VGA cable. Shame on you, Optoma!3) Optoma tech support does not answer my e-mails. Shame on you, Optoma!4) The zoom function is almost useless. So you need to move the unit back and forward to adjust the image size. The zoom function is used to minimal adjustments only.5) The DVD player is not region free.[UPDATE]6) After 18 months the speakers are gone..."
5,"Lovely voice, beautiful songs","Alfredo Sadel has a beautiful voice, equally at home with opera and popular music. This is a wonderful selection of 36 songs by this Venezuelan tenor. My only complaint is no liner notes, composers not listed, some song titles are wrong! I would also like to know when these songs were recorded, and who accompanied Sadel."
4,Excellent and valuable volume !,This book outlines the results of a series of micro-wear analysis of artefacts occurring in the late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic of Denmark. Such a study is unprecedented and fills a long standing gap in our knowledge of the continuity-discontinuity in artefact usage across the transition. This work becomes even more valuable now that the symbolic and contextual significance of artefacts in the Neolithisation process has become such a matter of animated discussion. The analysis of the artefacts is outstanding and the use of the denticulated blades in the late Erteblle Culture and Early Neolithic to process vegetable matter is demonstrated.
5,CHUMP,Brings me back to the days of growing up. All the episodes are there and the third disc was a great addition about how the show was made.
5,Lancelot Link is the Greatest,"I was very happy to see that my eleven year old son enjoyed these episodes as much as I did growing up. Laughing, wondering how the Chimps do all the things the do, noticing when a chimp mask is put on a human, and the corny jokes. All great fun."
5,great album -captures magnetism evident in live performances,"Great album from a rising star! She is a magnetic performer with unquestionable ""star quality"" and this CD captures it extremely well, especially on ""Jim"" and ""Overjoyed"". We have followed Sunny from the very beginning and are fortunate to live in Washington, D.C. area where we can catch her live performances whenever possible. Also, her debut CD ""Getting To Know You"" (J.Jordan Music), which also features acclaimed young pianist George Colligan, is well worth a listen."
5,Fabulous CD,"I've enjoyed this CD over and over. Her voice is strong and rich while still delicate when she wants it to be. The minimal instrumentation lets her voice stand out as it should! ""Overjoyed"" is one of the best of her songs yet the entire CD is thoroughly enjoyable. If you like the sound of a woman's voice against a backdrop of simple but supportive and well-done jazz style music you will love this CD! It is one of my favorites. In fact, of all the time I've been to Amazon, this one is the first CD I've ever been moved to write about."
4,Great - wish they'd get the order in,"I love these. They are not too flimsy for me, I use a diaper warmer and have had no problem since it has a pop-up option. The other wipes are way too rough. My only complaint is that Amazon has the refills on back order, so you have to order the ones in the plastic container, which I don't need."
1,"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy","These are the most flacid baby wipes I've ever bought. They stick together, and when you reach for one they all come up in one long stuck-together chain. You can't shake them apart. It takes two hands, and when you are in the middle of a poopie change, you typically have one hand around the baby's ankles to keep from setting him/her down in the poop. Also, when you're wiping, they ball up into nothing. I keep getting the poop all over my hands because they just wad up when I try to wipe the baby. I appreciate the hypoallergenic qualities, and I'm sure they are very sensitive, but they just aren't sturdy enough for the job they are intended."
3,"Some Wheat, Some Chaff","Oh, I don't know. I think C. has some important points to make about the role that genetic and cultural influences have in shaping our unconscious, and, hence, our decisions about our lives. But I think he needs to go back to the drawing board on some of his analysis of ""self."" Many of the features that he attributes to the self, are, in my opinion, also generated at the genetic/cultural, and more importantly, familial (i.e. early childhood) levels, not the absolutes that he claims. (Although I really liked his idea of the self as both a manifestation of our awareness, and its director.) I also liked the ""flow"" stuff. I think he is on to something there, the need for involvement and challenge and discovery. But I was not nuts about his semi-proselytizing tone, and the idea of directed evolution. I'm not sorry I read it, but it does feel to me like he is only half way to where he thinks he is, and where he wants to be. Which is a pretty cool place."
2,Perhaps devolving would've worked better,"I wish I could say this book really represented an evolution in psychology or how we conceive of the self, but the truth is, it really doesn't. If you read this author's other works, then this work can be thought of as half a step beyond those works. At times the author is judgmental, condescending, and whiny, and he doesn't offer much in the way of a concrete definition of self. The final few chapters predictably focus on flow, but don't provide anything significantly new to the theory that he hasn't offered anywhere else."
4,"Excellent description, weak prescription","The Professor goes beyond his rigorous research to propose speculative means for creating a new society. Might work, might not--hasn't been tried, so who can say? Inspiring and mind expanding, yet ultimately incomplete."
2,Not a practical solution for the problems today or tomorrow.,"First of all, this might not work in academia, though it may keep class in session a while longer. It certainly will not work in the larger world, because 95% of the people will not read or understand it. Even if they did, I doubt that they would buy the staunch evolutionary rhetoric, much less get into the religion of FLOW. It amazes me how so much study results in theories of so little relevance to mankind. ""Nice try, sire, but what shall we tell the PEOPLE?"""
4,Comments to Embedded Robotics,"Hi, so far the book is a little dissapointeing, because is to much centered to a commercial hardware (EyeCon) that is somewhat hard to adquiere to a group that has a very low budget for that kind of projects... but is important to have a reference. That is why it deserve a 3. But also supply a very important source of information for sensors and actuators design. That is why i gave an average of 4 stars.Best regards, and thanks for all the effort you made for me enjoying this book."
4,great music...........audio wanting,"Just got this from Amazon some weeks ago. Needless to say, the score is as legendary as the fantastic film it accompanies.The audio quality of the cd, on the other hand, is quite seriously lacking for some odd reason. I wonder if the original varese US release sounded this muddled and cold. Whatever the case, I think most would enthusiastically agree that this is one soundtrack that desperately demands more passionate treatment. Perhaps a definitive remastered edition....?"
5,Fantastic!,"This book features absolutely gorgeous charts in a nice variety of styles. The best part, to me, was that the charts are flawless - something you can only achieve by stitching each chart to test it, and someone has obviously done that for this book. I just completed the sampler of rows of houses as a gift for my mother-in-law, and it turned out beautiful.Fair warning: this is not for the beginner cross-stitcher! But if you have advanced beyond the easy kits and want to really create some art, this book is for you."
3,Beautiful but hard,"These are beautiful pictures, but difficult. If your like me and need fast projects because of small children, forget it. They use lots of beads and special threads. I think its great for your library. But these are very long and specialized, detailed graphs. I have to tell you I was happy that I bought it, but I will not be using it soon, some day when I have more time. There are some beautiful wedding samplers, pictures of flowers and no holiday special pictures, which I loved. If you like to work with beads and special threads go for it, if your a simple cross stitch lady like me with no time, wait until you have more time."
2,Personal Taste,"I thought I would really like this book. It's just not the kind of designs I like. It has way too many samplers for my taste. I really liked the tea cozy but there's not much in the way of instructions for it. I'm glad I only paid $5 for it with shipping. I'd be really disappointed if I paid full price.Just a little hint, if you collect cross stitch patterns from magazines, you probably already have half these designs.There are a few cute patterns, just not enough that I like."
2,Low fidelity,"I love Auld's playing on the soundtrack of ""New York, New York"". However, this compact disc is either poorly mastered, or poorly transferred from the original. I would pass on this."
2,Bosch PS10-2 Issues,"I bought this at the big orange home improvement store and really wanted to like it. The tool felt very heavy-duty, and the power seemed to be more than adequate for my purpose of installing cabinet hardware in tight places. The batteries charged very quickly. However, I noticed when I released the trigger, I could see a flash of light in the motor through the heat vents by the handle. I don't know if they all work this way, and assumed that they did, so I proceeded to use the tool. However, after I completed the work (I was driving the last screw), the driver stopped working in the forward-drive mode. It reversed just fine. I don't know if this had anything to do with the flash - maybe something burned out - but I had to take it back for a refund. I chose not to get a second one."
4,Bosch! Got it right!,"Great little drill,very compact and loads of power even with the 10.8 volt!This drill is lite-weight,and easily fits into your pouch when in constent use,and is much easier to handle than either DeWalt 14v. angle drill or Milwaukee close quarterangle drill."
3,"It's OK, but is definately a specialty tool","I've got the Bosch driver, but wanted a drill that was short between the chuck and trigger and more powerful.I purchased this expecting that it was an impact driver (i-driver), but it is not.This has slow startup when you squeeze the trigger, is rather larger (mechanics of articulating head I guess) and isn't any stronger than the other Bosch driver.I'll be returning this product because it isn't torquey enough for me, but I suppose many finish workers would like this tool for some tricky jobs.If it was an impact driver, I would have kept it and it would have served me greatly for the special task that I needed it for."
3,Gotta agree,"I echo most of the previous complaints, with the clutch issue being the most serious IMHO. The power, flexability, batteries are fine. The clutch is a joke, it really has no practical function. This Bosch is getting dusty while my Dewalt 7.2v got two shinny new batteries & is doing all that I ask (Except fit in real tight spots)"
1,Try before you buy,"I purchased this product because it appeared innovative and Bosch has a good reputation. I am very disappointed. The torque is sadly lacking. I am surprised that other reviewers have commented how ""powerful"" it is. It will not drive screws without pilot holes even at the lowest (highest torque) setting. It functions quite poorly as a drill due to the low rpm even at the highest setting. It was recently reviewed in a very popular woodworking magazine and given the thumbs-down. Not recommended."
3,OK,Would have been better is just a little smaller even if less power. Only real problem is the slow change chuck. My cheap balck and decker uses a double end screwdriver bit that just slips in and out. Faster to change and one bit with phillips and common type on one bit. The bosch you have to have 2 bits and to make it worse you will have to hunt in your tool box to change the bit since it dose not have a place to even store the extra bit on the tool like other high end tools like Makita drills. As a contractor this will last me longer and have more power but will not save me time over the cheap Black & Decker. Why cant bosch first get some feedback from people that use these tools first during testing.
5,Good product for a good price,"This is a great price for these plugs. I am an IT and go through these 4 pin rj11 plugs quite often. They are much harder to find than the rj45 network plugs that I use for cat5 network cable. These are for your classic residential home phone. If you are looking for the plugs that connect your handset to the receiver, you will want to find the 2 pin conductor mini rj11 plug. These plugs are for connecting the phone to the wall."
3,Just the trick,"If you've ever had a phone line with a broken plug, you know just how annoying it can be and if you haven't, take my word, it's a pain. But with these wonderful little darlin's that broken plug can become a working member of the staff. Cut off the broken plug, strip the wire, remembering to reverse the wires before you slip on the plug and crimp, its done. You'll do yourself a favor if you get the crimping tool, but get the plug for sure. I can hear you now, the phone works!"
2,Set shown - only spoon received,"The picture I got when I asked for this silverware was of a set of three: left or right handed.The name was so long, I only knew I bought what I thought was a right handed set, when I received a spoon. I have received a mail stating that ""the spoon"" will be a little late... I realized then that it was -what I thought- a left handed set, and ordered a right handed set, as I am not in the US, and wanted the goods as soon as possible.The cruel thruth was I ordered two sets, and received two spoons... and the larger ones! What if I was ordering for a kid?Please label your goods correctly, what user wants is not ""Maddadapt"" or ""built-up handle"", but ""Left (or right) angled spoon, fork, small spoon or set."
5,mdphilps,"The Fragrant Explosion is a great disc. I saw Clove live in Harrisburg and they rocked, so I purchased their CD. It is a great album. Jen has a great voice and the rest of band backs her up perfectly on this disc. If you haven't heard Clove yet, then this disc will give you a great idea of why I believe they WILL make it big, it is just a matter of time."
4,The Authority of the Bible by Robert Gnuse,"The author provides theories of inspiration about the Bible, including Revelation and the Canon of Scripture, from a Roman Catholic as well as Ecumenical (other Christian faiths) views. The development of Scripture is discussed, according to five different models - according to which Biblical authority may be classified, i.e. (1)Inspiration (2) Holy History (3)Existential (4)Christological and (5)Models of Limitation. For me as a student of God's Word, the Bible, this book was a good introduction to the basic issues of the Bible, and the ways in which Christians throughout the ages view the Bible as authoritative."
2,Disappointing!,I expected this book to have either more theory or more patterns or more of both. Someone who is already familiar with the concept of knitting in the round will probably not learn much from the book. Someone who is interested in learning may find the instructions to be somewhat vague. Someone who is looking for inspiration won't find much information. I own more than 100 needlework books and this is one of the few that I wouldn't feel compelled to keep.
2,Ugly Designs,There are better tutorials online for knitting in the round. I thought there would be some good projects in here to try but they are all hideous.
4,"all the right reasons, less cohesion","solid performances by de Kast but less ""together"" somehow than most of their recordings, offering something from all of their strengths, however, and a good listen overall"
4,A great look and insight of Jackie from the people in her life,"This books has a variety of memories and stories from a variety of pepole involved in Jackie's life somwhere along the line of her busy life. It shows a great insight on Jackie during the white house years and how she was with Jack Kennedy. Which just made me love that couple even more. The only reason it got 4stars from me is because they left out some comments from Caroline which is kinda suprising and to much of curtain persons personal opinions that were biased but otherwise a very great book to have especially if you are a Kennedy fan of any one in that family, this book really enforced that she will always be Jackie Kennedy and she never forgot that or tried to because you could tell that she thought about it and Jack daily in her comments. You can not possibily be dissapointed with this book."
3,I Can Sing En Francais! : Fun Songs for Learning French,"I bought this book thinking it also had the cassette with it. It does not. Customer reviews which write about the cassette are followed with a note from Amazon that it is a review for the ""Hard Cover"" edition.If you notice right below the reading level for this item, it says ""Hard Cover"". So I thought that this was the edition that includes the cassette. It does not.The book seems great otherwise, but you MUST know French and be able to read music though. It is difficult to know what tune you should be singing in if you can't read musical notes."
3,Jolene - Gloaming,"If you're like me, and wanted ""Pensacola"", that's almost all this album has to offer.There's a song or 2 more here that is okay, and worth a listen, but Jolene isn't a mega-talented group. They are a Brother Cain-type act imho, and not rly that good.[not a bad album either tho]- Get the single of Pensacola, save the $$."
3,A Community of Character,"In general,Hauerwas's intelectual approach sets a serious tone. Yet he takes much too much time deliberating and not enough time just saying what he wants the reader to understand. Although thoughtful, he is not for impaitient reader."
4,Seminary Book source - amazon.com,The price for this book was low enough that even a seminary student could afford it. But the surprising thing is the speed of delivery.
5,BUY THIS CD!,"This album is chock-full of raw, powerful, emotive energy that's infinitely less gimmicky than Macy Gray, more engaging than Dave Matthews, and more pleasant on the ears than Sheryl Crow (all of whom Sherri Jackson has been compared against). THIS is talent!"
3,Medicore at best,"Jungle Book is the third best Disney Movie Game for Game Gear, it is in the format of Aladdin(JumpingNRunning alot but Aladdin pulls it off MUCH!! better than Jungle book. Jungle Book also faals into the trap of being a direct clone of the Genesis version(Which was more challenging anyway) which doesn't give it of the originality that Aladdin posses. Aladdin is best, then Lion King(which is not much better), and Jungle Jungle Book is last because at least Lion King was more challenging. But they both are clones of their big cousin. Buy Aladdin"
1,jungle book,"you said this product was for sega dreamcast, but it is for sega game gear, we do not have a sega game gear, and my 5 year old open the box. I know I'm not out a a lot of money, but still I got something that is to no use to me. And I'm not very happy about that!"
1,Was'nt what a described,I thought it was a dreamcast game. But it turned out to be a gamegear game. And it cost just as much to return as to just keep it. Not happy at all
1,Not what I thought,I thought I was buying a game for my daughter's Dream Cast. Unfortunately that was not the case.
4,Have a few laughs with your cooking lessons,"This is a terrific cookbook using lots of veggies. Not the typical italian cookbook that I have used. Interesting recipes with lots of amusing side stories. Quite funny, I actually spent some time reading them to my husband and we both had a few laughs."
4,The Sicilian Gentleman,"For anyone out there who is Sicilian/American, this is a great cook book. The author's stories are great. Brings back memories about what your grandpa might have said. I'm going to make the ""Ricotta Pie"" (recipe in book) for the holidays this year to keep up the tradition of our wonderful heritage. I enjoyed reading through this cookbook as much as I enjoyed the recipes in it."
4,Vash's Past,"The Trigun series is very inconsistent for me. First it starts off with adventures that reveal little by little about Vash's past. The adventures were fun but then they come to some brief halt, revealing some of Vash's 'demons' This DVD basically clears up what happened in Angel Arms and is a transition to the end that will come. I'm hoping that the last 2 DVDs will be better than the past 2. Trigun did not keep me interested throughout most of it. Definately buy this if you already bought the past ones because there's no point skipping out on this one. I am just saying that this DVD might not keep some people's interests as well as the others. Just be prepared for lots of talking in this volume of Project Seeds."
3,"o.O;; DON'T DO IT, VASH!!!","-- Is what I wanted to scream during a certain scene (those who've seen this already can probably figure it out ^^;). Well, although I simply adore Trigun and Vash, this and the previous volume have been a disappointment compared to the greatness of volumes 3 and 4. x_X Vash acting ""tough"" annoys me...what's with the ""Ore""?!The first episode is the best on the volume and is basically one giant flashback, revealing who ""HE"" is. The other two aren't bad, but don't measure up to the usually high standards of this series. If you're collecting this series to the end, by all means, buy it. But do not start the series with this volume, start from the beginning. *_* Oh, and Knives rules. That is all. ^_^"
3,Good drama with fun to watch actor and actress.,"The story is a drama. The backdrop is a continuing feud between Chinatown and Little Italy. The plot involves two young innocents, an Italian boy and a Chinese girl, who fall in love through a chance meeting at a disco. When the gangs find the Italian boy in Chinatown, violence follows that brings about serious consequences for everyone involved.David Carusso is in this one, but an unknown, Richard Panebianco, is the star here. He has a fresh face and the camera makes him really look believable as an Italian teenager (maybe he was). It's worth a look if action and drama are your hot buttons."
3,previous review wrong,"The person above wasn't paying attention. This is 'China Girls,' not 'China Girl.' They are talking about the latter, a different film entirely. I have not seen 'CGirls,' and I would not recommend 'China Girl,' unless you are desperate and like cheese. Though teenagers tend to like 'China Girl' for it's cross-cultural Romeo and Juliet flavor."

5,These movies scream for a dvd release!,"The film The Monolith Monsters, is one of the more thoughtfulof the fifties sci-fi movies.This film along with The Day the Earth Stood Still. and WhenWorlds Collide. Take a philosophical approch to great question ""What if?"".These are great science fiction movies should have been released on to dvd long ago! (or at least re-released on vhs)"
4,Not Quite One Of Benjamin's Favorites,"I think we've only seen this one about 10 or 12 times, which is why it only gets four stars. The problem is that these monsters are just a little abstract for Benjamin (4 years old). There's no explosions, no army guys, and face it -- unless it's raining, the most dangerous thing about a monolith monster is that it might fall on you. The plague genre was handled much more effectively in movies like ""The Andromeda Strain"
3,Monsters as you've never seen them before!!!!,"Pretty good fare as far as 50's sci fi goes. Small desert town, police don't believe, scientist trying to figure out why, etc... Good acting throughout and it always adds to the credibility when filmed on location like this. While the mosters here are a bit different than what you might expect, they are intriguing nonetheless. (Ever see the 50's sci-fi flick The Magnetic Monster?)Definatley watchable, definately different, and props for trying to be original!!"
1,Do not buy this item.,"Google this item and see how defective it is.Olympus stopped making them for a reason.Radioshack, Target, etc stopped carrying them for a reason.My M:Robe has a missing/invalid file. There was no remedy besides sending this device to Olympus for repairs.You get what you pay for..."
2,"Looks cool, but that's about it","I had the m:robe MR-100 for 5 days before it crapped out. It looked cool, but when I hooked it up to my computer I had an extremely hard time uploading my files. Whoever came up with the software for this thing should be fired. Horrible. After I figured out how to get my files uploaded onto the m:robe, I used it for 5 days and shortly thereafter I turned it on and it never made it past the ""m:robe"" welcome screen. It stayed on that screen overnight (I left it on) and when I tried to shut it off, it wouldn't do that either. Junk. I returned it and bought a 60GB video iPod."
1,Bad choice.,"This is the worst product I have ever bought. The software is the most inefficient software ever. It always freezes my computer and its also very inaccurate. This product itself also happens to freeze, and the response timeing is very slow. Not a very good quality product at all. If u want this product to show off then its fine for you, but otherwise it is the wrong choice because of these problems i have encountered."
2,Beautiful hardware - Terrible software,"This potential ""ipod killer"" can hardly stand up on its own (feet) because of terrible software design. The player itself is beautiful and the designers ought to be proud of that but the software is a huge letdown. In the age of drag and drop mp3 players to have a propreitary software that is nonintuitive and full of bugs is a crime.I did all the updating but the transfer part kept hanging up on two mp3 files while allowing me no chance to exclude them. I finally deleted them and tried again. Everything seemed to transfer fine but the player itself would not play with the announcement ""retry synchronization."" Further attempts locked up my otherwise stable home-built, superbly cared for machine running windows 2000.Even though I'd be [...], I'm returning this thing."
4,Very Nice Alternative To Ipod,"In this day and age where it seems everyone has an ipod it feels good to have something noone else has, which is the m:robe 100. Coolness factor is definately there and I've gotten lots of attention from ironically ipod owners themselves. The player itself works fine, just as well as any other player. The sound can be a bit on the softer side but it's loud enough for when I want it to be loud. The only weakness is again like people have mentioned, the software. It's not very user-friendly. However, it's something that hopefully you won't be doing often, like me, so you'll only have to deal with it once. Other than that, it's great. Remember to get better earbuds because the one's included are like the apple earbuds, which aren't very good."
2,Don't bother buying.,I would not recommend purchasing this player. The software for synching it to a Windows PC is not user friendly and I frequently encountered errors when trying to load music on to the player. The player itself seemed to be very slow when it came to loading a newly selected song. Much slower than what I have experienced using an iPod and Creative Nomad MP3 player. My player has been sent in for repair three times for issues with the firmware. I therefore would suggest passing on this one unless you like a product that does not work reliably.
1,"save your money,buy an i pod","This is a real piece of junk, so it holds a lot of music, its slow from start up to changing songs playing, installing additional music is a real pain, I have had to re-install all the music just to add a cd.I paid 90$ thinking It was a deal, but it was a waist of money, there are no accessories available for it either, Ive had it two months and am having all kinds of trouble with it now, this thing sucks!!!"
4,40 CD's Loaded and Only 1.92GB!!!,"This is my first Mp3 player I bought. I bought it for 100.00, pretty cheap for a 5gb player. I noticed alot of people complaing about about the software and how long it taked to load songs to the mp3 player. Even though it can be a little tenuous sometimes, it was suprising how mand CD's i could put on the player, using the software. I am an electroics sales represenative and have not noticed to many M:robes come back. The only ones i noticed come back were the ones were people put download music on to the mp3 player. IT WILL CRASH IF THE MP3 WAS CURRUPT! Don't complain its not working when you take it back. I like design alot, even though I have to use the hold key all the time, since the controls are heat senseative. I like the M:robe now that i got it working. Another thing notices was that the music that was already loaded on to the comptuer, under windows media player loseless."
1,m:robe mp3 player doesn't play at all,"I jusst brough a new m:robe mp3 player today. I followed the instructions very carefully and also updated the software.However, it did not play at all. Doesn't matter how many timesI retry to resync, download new song/music; that crappy devicestill doesn't play.I will bring it back to store and return it. I will go to IPODinsteads."
2,terrible,"I have had my mrobe mr-100 for 3 days now. I have gotten 3 different errors on it, the latest being a fatal system error, which apparently requires my sending it to olympus to fix. I am not a computer retard.. i know a lot about them. This is quality hardware (the same cpu as the apple ipod the pp5020) but absolutly crap for software. By software i mean the music managment software (mtrip) and the firmware and software within the mrobe. It really pisses me off that a player that costs over $100 can have such poor quality control. Save your money for another month and get an ipod mini."
3,Software is horrible,I recently bought an mrobe 100 and its great. Everything about it is what it says except the software. The software didnt let me sync so I updated the software from olympus.com. It let me sync once before messing up again. I dont know what to do anymore because I can't sync. Unless Olympus comes out with good software dont buy it!
4,"""Oh My God -it's my Grandma's Food!!!""","""I was so delighted to actually see my grandmothers favorite recipes in this book -in her very own dialect!! There were 'Yaprakas', and 'Biscochos' - as she called them. And the authors descriptive narrations of the history of the food -was as if I could see my family from places long ago. When he said you never walked in a sephardic's house without being offered a buffet of food any present day caterer would envy, I had to laugh out loud! That was my family!"
2,NOT VERY GOOD,"The product looks nice in the picture, but the bowls dont fit nicely in it, and the metal was dented when i got them. Im disappointed."
2,Not the LP version,"An ok cd but it's not the original, which sucks because the best song is missing ! note- you can find the lp version on disc at musicstack.com"
3,runs a little small,It runs smaller than you think. I normally wear a 36 and a 38 was pretty tight. Too early too know if it is going to be durable in the salt water pool I swim in
2,Too Tight... but getting better,"I just measured my waistline. It's just under 38"". I previously bought a 38"" Speedo brand swimsuit with lycra-spandex material, and it fit perfectly. This one that I ordered from TYR, unfortunately, is too tight. It could be due to either of two reasons. Either 1) the sizing is off, or 2) the nylon, being less ""stretchy"", will not conform to my contours. I must emphasize, I am not overweight. I am a large guy who works out 5x per week, and have a mesomorphic frame. I would suggest that anyone with a mesomorphic or endomorphic frame should probably order one size larger. People who are natural ectomorphs (naturally long and skinny) should have no problem fitting into these.__________PS. I have worn it in the hot tub now, and dried it out. Oddly enough, it seems to fit better now... I have no idea why, but it does. Still though, be sure you have the right size and frame for this item!"
4,Great,"This is a great swim suit even if you have to do ""sexy and I know it"" in it;) it a great swim suit even for swim team or for fun:)"
3,starting to split,"I've had this dark blue suit since end of April 2012. I swim laps 3x a week, but only for about 15-20 mins each time. The pool uses ozone, there is chlorine also but much less than usual. I always rinse the suit in warm shower water and once in a while will soap it up with ivory soap (bar). It's starting to split just below the point where I tie the draw string. The split is only about one inch, but I'm expecting it to spread. On the plus side, the suit fits well and hasn't faded nearly as quickly as the Speedo's I wore for years in the same pool. Usually by this time a dark blue Speedo would be faded to very light light blue, almost transparent, and wearing through in spots.There's an Australian company that makes this kind of swim suit with a heavier nylon, but last time I tried to find them they had moved to a different city and disappeared (at least on the internet). I never had a chance to order one from them, but that's what we need...heavy duty nylon swimsuits."
2,Didn't last long,"I write this review after 1 year of purchase. This suit is long, long gone. How long did it last? I don't know, maybe 6 months. I swim a lot, 5~6 days a week but I have more than one suit so it's not like this suit was worn every day. The color faded and then the fabric went, and by ""went"" I mean the elasticity/compression was gone. This means your junk is sort of hanging out loosely - not good. Maybe that's just how suits are - chlorine is harsh. Most of my suits, regardless of the manufacturer seem to fade and stretch after a few months. My Speedo suit seems to have lasted longer. It was good while it lasted which is why it gets 2 stars. If you don't swim much, it's probably ok. If you swim a lot I don't think it will last long. I won't buy again."
5,Simply the Best Shaver,"I have tried them all, from manual to electric and the Schick Quattro products win hands down. I used the Gillette Mach products and they are good, but the Quattro gives a smoother shave and the blades last quite a bit longer. I have fair skin and shave every day, but there is no irritation. The blades are expensive but with the amount of use you get from each set, it's well worth it. Highly recommended."
5,Awesome little heater,Works great for our screened in patio area. Nice looking product with easy set-up and really puts out the heat
3,Good moments but uneven,"Sue Raney has a voice to die for and Bob Florence can play piano. Some of these performances work well. On others, Florence misses the boat as an arranger and I can hear Raney acting or showing off (like Maureen McGovern in her ""let me convince you"" and ""dig this high note"" moments). I love Johnny Mandel's music, but this is a mixed bag."
2,Good fodder for MST3K,"Matter of a fact, that's where I saw this. Even without the robots commenting on the bottom, it's a hoot and a half - just think - 5'-?"" Mel Torme as a heavy?!? The ""girls"" he's roughing up are usually 2-3"" taller than he is, even without the heels and outweigh him by 20-30 pounds. If you're in the mood for a howler - rent it!"
2,Disappointing,Glitter was pretty on my pastries but I was under the impression it would be flavorless and it actually had a yucky aftertaste.
4,Edible glitter,I was looking for something more metallic; this stuff wasn't radically different than what I could get at my local grocery store for a lot less money.
2,more information needed,ALL battery specifications should include the capacity (mAh) and nominal voltage of the cell in order to compare types.
2,Predictable,"The first half of this book was very good. The characters seemed believable and I actaully had hope for this pre-teen book. but once the second half hit, it went downhill. The whole story line switched, everything was predictable and it had the most cheesy, sappy, happy ending of all time, which was tottaly ironic (not the good ironic but the stupid ironic) since the main charcter is not into the cheesy and sappiness of life. This book has tottaly turned me off to any and all Hailey Abbott books."
4,Decent shock for the price,KYB 5522 is a very nice shock giving a firm but not harsh ride. I put a set on the back of my 55 Chevy. I'm happy.
1,Too much for the doorstep,"*breathes in, breathes out* I will try and calm myself before giving thsi reveiw but, I must tell you it isn't easy! I am a 16 year old Wiccan...I have been practicing for almost 2 years now...in my opinion, this ""product"" doesn't even deserve the title of ""book""....nor do it's writters even know what they are talking about! ""The most common demons""??? Hello! As if things aren't hard enough without a book like this on market! We don't worship SATAN...Goddess, have these poeple lost their minds? I found the entire thing completely disrespectful and all around rediculous! I spent ten bucks and i wouldn't be caught dead using it as a paper weight! WHAT A WASTE OF TREES AND THEIR PAPER! If you are looking for information on Wicca or Witchcraft, might I suggest Scott Cunningham, Dorreen Valiente, or Raymon Buckland... please,burn your money before you purchase this ""book"". thank you. BB"
1,Not Worth the Paper Its Printed On,"This is ridiculous. Don't get this book, its all unsubstantiated, falsified crap. Sorry, but this was made to get a quick buck."
4,Thai peanut sauce,Just a little spicier than what I'd imagined it would taste like but that is just me. I add a little sesame oil to cool it down a bit and sometimes add a bit of peanut butter too.
5,Better than Ever,"I have been waiting soooo long for a new release by Michael and it was worth the wait. Every cut is a testimony to the many facets of our loving GOD. My favorite today is All Day All Night. If you're an old fan or a new listener, I promise you will not be disppointed."
1,What happened to his voice?,"Michael English has lost his voice. It's a shame, but this record and any recent recordings portray his voice in a horrible way. Michael had one of the biggest ranges I've ever heard and never did he lose control. In this record and everything since ""Hope"", his vibrato is out of control and is range is gone. Sad story."
5,Nearly Perfect Sound Quality,"This is a review of the sound quality, not the music.This disk sounds fantastic. Really, there is nothing wrong with the way it has been recorded, mixed, and mastered. No distortion, clipping, or compression here. All in all, I give this disk top marks.I should note my disk is from the 1990's, I don't know if it has been remastered like some of Oregon's other albums. If it has been remastered, I'd recommend getting the 1990's version, as the remasters have been spotty."
1,WORST DELPHI BOOK EVER!!!!,"This is the worst delphi book i ever purchased...it doesnt even related to Delphi 2006it is for absolute beginners, explains basic pascal routinesdoesnt even touch anything related to the new borland product Delphi 2006.I regret i ever bought this book...just a waste of money, i allready put this book on the waste basket, didnt even put it on the shelf"
4,Good Book for Beginners,"There haven't been all that many new Delphi books in recent years so it was pleasant to find this one. This book appears to be aimed at new Delphi programmers and it does a pretty good job of bringing them up to speed. Advanced Delphi programmers will probably not find a great many items of interest, but they might find a few. I've have used all ten versions of Delphi (and most versions of Turbo Pascal) and have about one hundred books in my library on Delphi. So, while most of the information was not new to me, I did run across one or two little gems I had not seen before.I'm glad I bought it."
4,Good book for its purpose,"If you're already an advanced Delphi programmer, you're not likely to find a whole lot ""groundbreaking"" in here. But if you're new to Delphi, or just want to brush up on a few areas you may have missed, this is a good book."
1,Inside Delphi 2006,"At first glance, the title would lead one to believe that this book will reveal an abundance of knowledge pertaining to the latest version of Delphi called Delphi 2006.The only revelation that becomes quite apparent, within first two chapters, is that of the title.The book contains a synopsis of previous versions of Delphi, from Delphi 1 to the present. The silence is finally interupted in the last few chapters when a miniscule amount of pertinent information is forthcoming about .net funtionality and Delphi 2006.If you are an ardent Delphi programmer, SAVE your money."
5,little,Gave as a gift - the little boy had one already so this was the backup should it get lost! Mom happy to receive ;)
3,It was...alright.,"As a Bruce Springsteen fan, and Nebraska possibly being my favorite album of his, I really liked the idea of this book. It's what made me buy it from Goodwill for a buck.Ten chapters based on the lyrics of each song. Loosely-based I must say. In fact I'd really describe the book as more inspired by the Nebraska album if anything. There are connections to the songs no doubt, but drawing a few lyrics out to become twelve pages changes things. It was a short and easy read, a few hours maybe.If there's one thing I noticed most at each chapters end, it's that many of the stories never really went anywhere. But maybe that's the point, because the characters never really went anywhere either.Not surprisingly, I believe these stories may be more enjoyable backed with a guitar."
5,Great! Pure pleasure to listen to!,A pre-release copy is already garnering fans in Houston. We hope there will be many more CD's by the Watters Brothers!
2,Nothing new,It looks like it was quickly thrown together so someone could make a few bucks. You learn nothing from it that you couldn't find out from reading wikipedia and it plays none of his music. The clips are not good quality either.
1,Waste of time and money-unauthorized and uninteresting,"I do not have time to say much but I felt I had to protect fans such as myself from buying JUNK. Michael is unquestionably the GREATEST ENTERTAINER that ever lived, But he was human and had faults and limitation ""outside of the entertainment"" world. He was used and exployed by managers, friends and SONY. But this video was fluff with NO NEW CONTACT and contained no new information or insight into Michael or his world. It was clearly an attempt to quickly put together. with no budget, a collection of old news photos and even some said ""video taken by a fan"". They should allow ZERO STARS for juck like this."
2,Not Great,"Thankfully, this video didn't cost much. There were a few segments that I was glad to have. But it was obviously thrown together in a hurry and the editing was horrible. The narrator's comments frequently didn't match the pictures or video clip. They would show a picture or video clip that was not the same time period the narrator was speaking about. Not well done."
1,Not for Jackson Fans - Cashing in on Michael's Passing.,"True Michael Jackson fans should avoid this DVD. It was given to me as a gift, and I immediately was doubtful based upon the unknown production company behind its creation (not to mention the short running time). It is pure capitalization, turning the passing of a the world's greatest superstar into quick dollars. It is filled with errors, repetitive imagery and poorly written and delivered voiceover. You will realize within the first few moments that you've been taken when the images no longer coincide with what's being discussed, and it shows itself for the ""thrown together"" kitchen sink of material it is. Don't waste your time or your dollars. What a shame."
1,Terrible - An awful production job,"This DVD is absolutely terrible. They obviously didn't get the rights to any of his songs because NONE of them are played during the video. While the announcer talks about an event that happened in Michael's life, they would show footage of something completely different! Very poorly put together and unprofessional. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this DVD. I'm not even sure I'd recommend it to anyone if it were free! haha. It's really not even worth your trouble."
1,Not Woth It,"This isn't worth the buy. As others have said, it looks quickly thrown together. I find the pictures and the video's shown don't at all match the naration of the DVD. There are better biographies to buy out there. This isn't one of them."
1,"Grainy News Footage, no music, no music video.","Easily the biggest piece of exploitive junk video ever made about Michael Jackson. This brief video contains no music or music video from Michael Jackson, I repeat none, its a cobbed together mess of public domain news clippings with a C-List booth announcer (think cleaning-product commercials) droning on about facts everyone in the planet already knows about Michael Jackson. A piece of utter video junk."
2,"JUST OKAY IN MY OPINION, ABIT BLAND","Listen their is nothing majorly wrong with this DVD, it has all the facts on Michael Jackson from Birth to his untimely death, but nothing new if you are an avid fan like myself. Although it is nice to see Michael Jackson and his career on 1 DVD, ihe narration becomes boring after a while and seems just like a person reading out facts about Michael Jackson while images are shown, it just did not captivate me I could only watch it twice then I got bored of it. But hey if you are a true MJ fan and love collecting anything that has to do about him than get yourself a copy, if you want to be blown away by the magic of MJ mmm not this one, rather buy a original authorised MJ product."
1,Worse than you think,"Keep your money. Do not waste it on this faux documentary. Michael Jackson's story is so much more dynamic than this piece of garbage. How can you make a biography about a musical genius and have absolutely none of his music in it? Very little substance, bland interviews and a script consisting of some dude basically reading through a wikipedia page. What's worse is that if you watch this, you'll be more upset by the time you wasted than by the money you wasted. Whoever made this was obviously just out to make a quick buck.That's all I have to offer, sorry."
4,LOVE THIS!,This is a really nice DVD about MJ and his life. I loved it. It tells alot about him from a baby to his death. This is a must have...
4,outstanding - but not for everyone,"My favorites are the riffs on gandhi (the ""hip gann"") and jesus (the ""nazz"", for nazarene). Even my mother, a conservative Methodist, after hearing the nazz, said ""he is very talented"", but another much more liberal religious Episcopalian friend seemed slightly scandalized. This guy is way past anyone else I have ever heard, but basically a lovely human being. When his saintly Gandhi admits, after urging, to a host for his honorary musical gig, that he did not have there the instrument he likes most, the host says ""Then straighten me, and tell me what that instrument is"". The Gann says ""the spinning wheel baby,.... I hope I didn't bring you douwwnn.... heh heh heh"". Of course students of even movie history know that gandhi helped the Indians gain independence from British occupation and economic monopoly partly through encouraging domestic use of the spinning wheel. Not a record to hear repeatedly, but definitely something to hear once."
5,The Greatest ! !,"As a Musician I've heard some Music Speek such as Hip,Gig,Jam,""That Cat"", and so on, and Sir Buckley is the Funniest / Hippest Raconteur that ever walked this ""Sweet Swingin' Sphere"" (Earth), if you are a Musician / Artist (or know one) or a person who just enjoys listening to great Storiy Telling in the most unique and humorous manner this is for you."
3,rubber Breaks after a while if keep around the coins. so after use take of the rubber band and keep in the plastic bag it can in,This quarter trick is awsome but the things is that the quarter has a real thin rubber band around it and this keeps the quarter pieces together from pretending to break. So after awhile from showing this trick the rubber gets wet from using your mouth to do the trick so after putting the coin trick away it will dry up from the witness and after many times doing the trick and weting and drying of the rubber band it will break.
4,Great trick for kids!,Great trick for kids! Did this trick for a couple of kids over for a New Years Evevparty and WOW you should have seen their faces!!! Jaw dropping...It wouldnt take an adult long to figure out. The product I bought came with 3 extra rubberbands. The other review I read said that he had trouble with the rubberbands getting wet...I simply use my teeth only and it never gets wet...Just a suggestion. Also helpful hint: Find another similar quarter same date ect...and keep it in your pocket...they will ask to see the quarter and you will obviously know which one is which when you reach for it in your pocket...enjoy the trick!
2,What Happened,"For fans of Negima! you will be disapointed. The anime leaves a lot to be desired. Poor animation and a bad story line are two of the biggest problems with the anime. The manga is rated 16+, the anime on the other hand is rated PG, so they took out a lot of whats in the manga. Compared to the Love Hina anime, which was also done by Xebec, the Negima! anime just doesn't live up to expectations."
2,Just get the Manga,"I really wanted to like this, but sadly it's a diluted version of the sotry in the books. The character deisgns and animation are subpar for an anime released in the 21st century.I enjoy Akamatsu's work so I stick pretty much to the books. It's a more satisfying experience. Sure you don't get a lot of frills or premiums with a book, but does that matter?"
4,Timely and stimulating work,This is very helpful for Protestants interested in how our traditional emphasis on justification can be joined with the Eastern approach of theosis. Very hopeful book for the future of a united church.
2,I is for inadequate,"I Is For Infidel offers a naive and narrow view of the fighting in Afghanistan. The author fails to consider the many shades of gray that historically have clouded the conflict, which is particularly surprising given her claim to have followed the issues closely for 18 years. Among Gannon's more unusual suggestions are that the current effort to rebuild Afghanistan could have happened without involving any former warlords/mujahidin leaders and that the country would have been better off if Taliban leader Mullah Omar had been able to implement his true plan. Interested readers would be much better off reading Steve Coll's Ghost Wars, Ahmed Rashid's Taliban, Robert Kaplan's Soldiers of God, and/or George Crile's Charlie Wilson's War."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Gannon provides us with a reasonably good synopsis of what happened in Afghanistan from the end of the Russian occupation to the present. She spends an inordinate amount of time dealing with Pakistani issues, apparently to fill space.The epilogue is paticularly forgetable as she segues into a daitribe against President George W. Bush. Her radical left-wing bent shows when she avers that the leader of the West is, like Saddam Hussein, a megalomaniac. Spare us, please."
4,A good love story,"In Cindy Bonner's first novel, 15 year old Lily DeLony falls madly in love with Marion ""Shot"" Beatty, the youngest of the ""Beatty Gang"". In the beginning Lily, a church going girl, resists Marion's charms although she is eventually won over by the bronze haired robber. After a town shootout and lynching, the two run away together and marry only to be burdened with the law after them.I found Lily to be a good story, but not as good as her latest book Right from Wrong. Luckily the Seattle weather was wonderful this weekend and I was able to sit in the sun and read this book within one day."
5,Amazing Story,I loved this book so much. I was able to get into the book so quickly and the author's descriptions made you feel as if you were inside the book. This is definitely one of my favorites!
2,Seen and Tasted Better than this one,"I was sort of dissappointed by this book. I thought that the recipes should have been nicer then they really was. I think that everything turned out a little bit dry, but I think that was my fault and not Mrs. Jains. The introduction to this book also left me confuesd. There is another Indian food author, Dalal something, she is better."
3,Great book for Indian food freaks,"While I must admit to disliking Indian Food, this book goes a long way in changing my opinion. I am confused, however, to whom this book is targeted. On point of distress that I found about the recipes for this book was that they all tended to give me bouts of indigestion and gas. I suspect that this was due to the over use of soybeans. And when do soybeans get used in Indian food to begin with? See what I mean by confusion? That is why I rate this book a '6'. While the basic recipes are good, Manoj Jain tends to ramble on about soybeans. I don't care about soybeans when all I want is good food."
2,This book is no good. Doesn't deliver what it promises,"I am very dissappointed by this book. For some reason or other my lover gave me this book for Valentines Day. I tried out several recipes which were supposed to have aphrodesiac qualities. They didn't. I broke off the relationship with my lover at that point. I even stopped being vegetarian because of this book. I was severely dissappointed. I cried, and ate a rack of baby back ribs for the first time at my local Chili's. This book made me eat animal flesh!!"
5,This book does an excellent job at refuting foolish atheism.,Dr. Morey's book is absolutely great. He exposes the moral & spiritual bankruptcy of being an atheist. The atheist is scared America. They will try to fight harder and harder against Christians- especially within themselves. I urge Christians to read it.
1,More disappointing drivel,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of an acquaintance hoping it would help me address some of the tougher criticisms against belief in God, and sadly I have to admit I was gravely mislead! Morey simply revamps the tired, outworn arguments (if one can even call them that!) and seems more like he's complaining about the fact that there are atheists than attempting to deal with the issues he says he's dealing with.Perhaps I'm just growing up and now I'm seeing through all of this garbage."
1,A very poor effort,"This book has so many errors ( I counted two per. page)it is one of the worst apologetics books ever written. As far as Morey being a great debater, I tried to arrange a debate in Cleveland, Ohio with Morey and the late Gordon Stein. Morey never even returned my phone calls! I don't see much of Morey on the Internet Infidels website either. I am sure that he would have no problem finding debate opponents there."
2,"Fun to read, but for the wrong reasons","A Christian friend of mine, who I considered quite bright recommended this book to me. I'm fairly open-minded, and I thought Dr. Morey even makes a couple of good points. But he also makes many bad points. For example he is always attacking particular atheists personally, instead of their arguments. Also he seems unaware at how circular his thinking is, he points out how non-believers will not live according to scripture. He finds this significant, where I wonder, ""What else would you expect?""My friend also suggested that write to Dr. Morey. I did send some of my questions to him, however, I never received a response. If you want to be entertained, I think it likely you may enjoy this book. However, I'm sure that there must be better defenses of the Christian Faith."
1,completely misleading,"this book was clearly written for theists who need reaffirmation by attacking there opposition...no atheist thinks like thisif this is how the author truly sees atheism I doubt he ever had a discussion with an atheist over the age of 12...no learned non believer would ever make such frivolous claims, most of which are mirrored in theist thinkingas was pointed out by a fellow reviewer (suptrans, you have no idea how much respect I have for you for such a vivid explanation for the flaws of this reasoning)I was at a total loss when it came to showing the theist readers how rediculous these arguments areapparently theist decided to abandon all logic and are now accusing atheists for theories which are not a part of atheist thinkin or at least twisting them into irrationalityI have yet to stumble upon a theist writer who considers the rebuttal to his arguments and actually tries to stand up to themdon't wait for that to happen""God"" will materialize before you first XD"
1,Begs for negative stars,I guess he missed the one about Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness. What a shallow pathetic screed. If you wanted to create more atheists telling them to read this book and to read the Bible would absolutely guarantee it. I got this for 50 cents at a charity yard sale. It was overpriced.
4,GOOD MANGA,"Hi (...) I'm as a new fan of manga I've only read about 7 so far but I have already become obsessed with them and intend to read more. I look back on this manga quite fondly as it was the first I ever read it was good lots of action,good plot and halorious storyline as well as indepth characters the only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the fact that it at times was VERY confusing but all and all it was good manga and what started my obsession."
3,"feels like it's just surface level, so far","This book takes place at a school were there is more attention paid on how well the students fight than on how well they're learning things in class. There are so many clubs for different fighting styles that they're all fighting for space and money. Ryoko Mitsurugi is one of the best fighters in the school. Shizuma Kusanagi comes and shakes everything up by starting K-Fights, which allow students to resolve issues through battle.The artwork is nice, although the layout is occasionally confusing, since so much tends to go on in one page. I don't really have a lot of problems with this volume. The reason I'm giving it a three is because I feel like the characters might as well be cardboard cutouts. There aren't even all that many hints that there are depths to them. I'll be reading the rest of this series because I don't think it's bad, but I hope that the other volumes had some depth to the characters personalities."
1,An incoherent mess,"Despite the fact that the little bit of plot that's here is pretty simple, Reiji Saiga's poor writing, awkward pacing, and dreadful layouts make it almost impossible to follow. Things seem to constantly happen for no reason to bland, cliched characters. And if you're hoping that it at least has decent action, it's almost impossible to figure out what's going on in the fights, which are brief and usually only finish with only one character ever making contact with the other. This is up there with Bomber Girl as one of the most dreadful manga series ever translated into English. Avoid."
1,Not Good At All,"OK, I bought this manga, because I had heard good things generally about it, and was actually looking forward to reading it, but when I got it I hated it from page one. I actually could not even finish it, so I can't actually tell you the story, except for whats on the back, whihc is essentially, its a school where you fight and are graded on it(kinda like Battle Vixens, but without the T & A or bad language). The art work in this series was dark and offended my eyes. The writing was good, but was also against my eyes with the poor art, I hated this and won't read the story, even if it may be a good one."
2,Horrible,"Ok, this one of the worst mangas i have read. I really don't liek the characters(except Ryoko's aunt, she's hilrious) in this story, and the story itself is not so great. I put 2 stars because it deserves some credit. I mean, there are some funny parts. Hilrious in fact(Mostly in the second one)And this stroy dose make u care a little what will happen next. It could be worse..... You could not care at all what happens next. One more thing... the art. Gawd do i h8te the art......................................."
4,A Good Look Inside,"While there are newer books on prison life, this is still one of the best. It gives a surprisingly balanced view of past and current treatment of prisoners and a good look at prisoners' lives from their own perspective."
5,Lasagna: Classic and Contemporary Favorites,"I'm not a very experienced cook, but I found these recipes very easy to follow and extraordinarily delicious."
5,Horror At Its Best!,Book is written after the style of LeFanu. You will think thisauthor was born in the 1800's as he attempts and achieves this style of classic horror writing. Vampire books ordinarily are not high on my list of horror reads but this one has changed that!
5,Good as new!,This is a great tool! Powerful enough to cut through some really dense fiberboard. A couple of scratches on the casing are just fine on a tool.
3,not for my boy,"i have a 9 month old Coton and grooming is a challenge. he yelped once when i first tried it out and since the wood pin brush has been tolerable for him, i've just stuck with it. maybe after his adult coat comes in, i can try this again..."
3,Full metal,I actually like this DVD. However it seemed that the episodes on the DVD should have a lot more of them and a fewer DVDs of full metal to buy in the future. I think that this seller has great sellsmenship and outstanding repersentation of this DVD of full metal. Thanks a lot. You get a stagering A++++++++++++++++++. Way to go.
2,I agree with Murat.,"I bought this CD regardless of the less than stellar review preceding this one, only because Gene Hoglan is one of the few musicians I like enough to try and collect their every appearance (James Murphy and Steve Digiorgio being the only others on that short list). After hearing it, I find that I'm pretty much in complete agreement with everything contained in that previous review. I just couldn't find anything to like about this album - and I tried pretty hard being that Gene plays on it. Truthfully, if somebody else had been playing drums I wouldn't have been able to force myself to listen to the whole thing. I apologize for this review not being helpful, but I was really looking more to rate it than review it."
2,I'm so disappointed,"I've been a fan of the Roches for years. Love their harmonies, their quirky views on life, and their honesty. All of that makes this CD so disappointing! Many of the lyrics are insipid and we're left wondering why Terre's talent for writing a lyric hasn't kept pace with her considerable growth in guitar playing and melodic craftsmanship. The biggest disappointment is that the watery lyrics are often accompanied by a breathy, unsupported, girlish voice that is irritating (and inappropriate)coming from a fortyish woman. This affectation is especially grating in the upper range of her voice, where it sounds amateurish. Too bad."
3,The good one's go first,"This is what can happen when a great musician gets bland. No real excitement in this one and he made a few greats in his time. The best ones are not around on cd, from this source anyway. He made a great recording with the vocal group 2+2.That cd with Pancho Sanchez had real excitement. This one is best passed up, unless you need this to complete the collection."
3,"Good value, not as sticky as other tape","This is a better value than the shorter roles sold in most home improvement stores. This roll is considerably longer and easier to peel and than a similar product sold in stores. It is noticeably less sticky than other brands I've used, though. So for large projects adhering paper-faced insulation or covering seams between pieces of flexible metal piping this would work well. But if you need extra strong adhesive this would not work as well as other brands."
2,Not malleable enough,Not malleable enough.Compared to other aluminum tapes that I have used this one is too thin and does not contour around stuff as well.
5,Great Product,"This is a very nice display. It does cost $10 to get the engraving done, but it is well worth it. Great product."
3,Hole In One,"Fortunely I had to purchase two Hole In Once Displays. The first one came with no problems. It looked very professional and expensive. However, when I ordered the second one, the glass was broken. I'm sure it happened during shipment. When I called ProActive Sports they were friendly but would not exchange it because I ordered it through Amazon. It would have been a hassle so we are using the display without the glass front."
1,What happened to customer service?,"This product looked like a great and fairly inexpensive way to show off my hole in one. When I received the product the words ""Hole in One"" were significantly off center. I sent an e-mail and was 'assured' if I returned it, it would not happen again. In addition to that, I would receive $10 off the product for my troubles. I sent it back and received a new one. Same thing. The words were significantly off center. When I e-mailed back again they said they may be out of the product. Weeks later, I am stuck with what looks like a pretty shotty piece of work and no $10 refund. Not Happy."
1,Enermax Banned,"You get what you pay for. Amazon, UNIXSurplus, and United Parcel did a good job in getting this item to me. Enermax however has a horrible history in quality control. I assumed my old power supply was bad and replaced it like for like with this item. Item would not power up the motherboard. I assumed I had other issues and trouble shot everything at significant expense. Two days later went to a PC repair shop with the item and had it checked. Result was unstable output voltages. Thanked the guy and bought one of his favorite power supplies. It lit the motherboard and drives immediately. PC repair guy said Enermax has been banned from his shop and vendors he works with. I will do the same. Not worth the trouble to try and refund or replace. Out enough money and time already."
4,a musical oddity,"this album was composed by musicians of the band Roxy Music, the disc has been discontinued and is very hard to find, the best song is Loreley"
5,Top class very Talented & are sure to go a long way,"Cyclefly are brilliant on stage, lead singer is a maniac on stage, you cant take your eyes off him. I've seen them a few times in the UK."
2,didn't see a difference,so far I didn't see any improvement on the fountain.I decided clean the fountain and see how it goes
2,Dont works,"Sorry, I never give any reaviews but I think I need everybody know this product doesnt work. Its better use the bleach."
1,Pure junk ...,"I ordered 3 of these for 3 boys and I couldn't choose the colors. I got 1 blue and 2 pink (yeah I thought it looked orange too). The boys didn't mind since they love all that is Spongebob. However, they are very cheaply made. Right out of the package the paper stuck to the top of the bands on all 3 and I can't get it off. Plus, the band broke off on one of the pink ones right at the hole where the sizing pin goes. Since the boys are small, they had them on the first hole and the rest of the holes are on the part of the band that snapped off. Did I mention this was within hours of wearing it? It cost me $20 for 3 watches that are garbage."
5,For Children??,"I don't understand the part that this book is recommended for children. The pages to color are pretty advanced, and probably meant for maybe 15-16 year olds and older. Someone who will take the time to concentrate, and stay in the little, detailed lines. Some of those ""fried Eggs"" can get pretty small. This is NOT a calendar. It is more of a ""seasonal"" book. There are themed pages. Some summer, and some with snow for winter. Leaves falling for fall. No dates, and stuff like that.Just wanted to clarify. Thanks for listening."
4,Well worth the money!,Any book that has Motorhead references early on will keep you reading. Quick and funny! Keeps you turning the pages and laughing all the the way. Still looking for my wayhone.
1,bad sound,"I recieved this tv for Christmas. After 2 weeks, the sound stopped working. I sent the tv back. Customer service was great. They sent me a new tv. I have had this tv for 2 weeks and guess what. Sound is going on it. The picture is fantastic, but without sound its a bummer. There must be something wrong with the 37"" model."
2,Bad,The Voyger Series Cd's are just bad. I would never buy another one. There is more to select from at amazon.
5,FABULOUS,"This book blew my mind. I have been reading and studying truth for nearly thirty years. Head knowledge I have....what was missing was the heart devotion.Linda Johnsen's book provides a feast for both.She is a scholar , an outstanding writer , has had a moment of knowing herself....and devotion . What more is needed?I have never run across better explanation of this wonderful, LIVING tradition of the Goddess as worshiped in India for many thousand of years.Johnsen beautifully explains the deep issues illustrated in what seemed to be simple fairy tails . You'll see Hindu culture much diffirently after reading this book.The clarity and beauty of Johnsen's writing , plus her deep understanding of the subject, will make this book a favorite. Look for anything from this author . She never disappoints ."
2,a version of lethargy towards faith,"i tried to like this book and failed. it's the resurrection and there is nothing else. i think you have to take that or leave it. i decided to take it. linda is obviously a scholar but if you don't believe in being guided by this traditiion it it just a lot of mumble jumble nonsense which one can enjoy reading, i did somewhat, but you have to enjoy reading fiction. i kept hoping she could cover in some detail how to reconcile a fundamental tenet to christianity and this tradition-she did not."
4,Dreamweaver 4,"After looking thru tons of books on DW 4 I finally picked this one. Very easy to understand, well organized and helpful, I spent about 3 hours doing some of the practice lessons and was able to create a webpage after that. I have not used Dreamweaver before, so given the complexity of the program I would have to say this is a Great book!"
5,Batter Up! (as in cooking)!,"""When I Cook, They Run"" touches all the bases of miserable meal making. Written tongue-in-cheek (so she can't taste the food), Karen Kallet is the ""Contrarian Cooking Gourmet Goddess."" Taste(less) tested recipes with hefty helpings of humor. . . this book hits a hilarious homerun!"
2,This is not a handbook,"there is a wealth of information, here esp. on the early church, however this is not a handbook. It lacks coherent organization and an index. If you find anything interesting note it's location, otherwise you will never find it again short of rereading the whole book."
2,Cordless Power tools,I just love my Dewalt cordless tools. I have a large lot and built a shed more than a 100 feet from the nearest electical outlet. No cords that was great. The tools have plenty of power and long battery life. The trim saw is my very favorite.
5,dewalt tool kit,"This product is amazing. It' reconditioned, so I was skeptical at first, but it works as if it were brand new. It arrived in a very timely manner (3 days with bargain shipping) and still had the original owners manuals for all 4 tools."
2,"weak battery, low quality tools",Reconditioned tools were really unsatisfactory because of weak batteries (although 18V) and worn parts re-used and sold. Get new ones instead from a brick-mortar store so you can walk in and return/change.
5,Super Cheap and like new!,"I couldn't even tell that they have been refurbished.I've been wanting a cordless set for a while and was thinking about getting a cheaper brand, but at this refurb price, I had to buy it.Great set for the money!"
5,Beyond the Beyond,"If your ready to go deep, so far deep that this world drops away completely. If you can handle timelessness to the degree that you loose all tethers to this temporal world - Gate Gate, Para Gate, Para Sam Gate, Bodhi Swaha! (Gone Gone Gone beyond!) Into the beauty realm of pure music, music wherein your soul and the one soul make love - then take this trip with Mindia Devi into bansuri land, the pure land of bamboo flute. Ecstasy and melancholy mingle. Magic and soundsation, an intimacy with the deepest recesses of the self. Also a great musician. Her masters touch, Hari Prasad CHaurasia, can be felt and heard in the gorgeous fullnes of each tone. Her root guru, Ali Akbar Khan, can be detected in the sensitivity to the essence of the Raga. Mindia Devi stands apart as one whose calling is clearly being met!"
2,Not worth it,"This book had a lot of inaccurate information and did not include any gold standards for diagnosis or up to date treatment regimens. It lacked some important diseases and conditions. Layout very basic, probably too basic for most clinicians to use during rotations. Don't spend the money on this, buy the current Griffith 5 minute Clinical Consult instead."
2,El Ventilador,"Despues de ver excelentes producciones como EL CARTEL DE LOS SAPOS y SIN TETAS NO HA PARAISO ,tenia altas expectativas con esta serie EL VENTILADOR...sin embargo...es indiscutible la diferencia.No se si es el guion o las actuaciones..pero simplemente no me gusto."
2,"It seems all OK, but...","The boxset package is precious, so as the 6 dvd discs but...Unfortunately the disc # 2 doesn't load.Tryed in different DVD devices and PC:DVD # 2 is dead.Probably it's loaded, but with not any effectwhen you try to read it !!Surely a manufacturer's trouble or mistake."
2,Mediocre,"After seeing other Colombian productions, such as Sin Tetas No Hay Paraiso, El Cartel De Los Sapos, Las Muñecas De La Mafia and other series, this one is not so good, the actors do not make any efort to be convincing. It could bave been better. After the third episode I was loosing interest. The acting was too fake. Christian Tappan did nothing but follow Marlon Moreno. Good actors but bad acting."
2,very disappointed,"I received this toaster as a gift for the holidays. After 3 months in order to get the toast to medium, we had to put the darkness all the way up. Now the only buttons that work on the toaster are the toast button. The cancel button along with the others do not work. We now have to purchase a new toaster."
3,So-so,"Well, it's a perfectly good toaster. I haven't experimented much with the fancy buttons but bread in - toast out, what more could you want? Unfortunately I think it's kinda ugly. It's actually very large for a 2-slice toaster and most of the space is taken up by a wide expanse of cheap-looking plastic on the top. The cord is very short. It works so I will keep it but I'm sorry I bought it, I could've had a much less expensive ugly toaster that worked."
5,Just fine,"Just as advertized. Maybe a little weird looking in terms of toasters, but it works. Finger prints don't seem to be a problem with this finish. It's easy to stow the cord when not in use."
3,Nice but a little bulky,Nice toaster with lots of options. Does a good job too. Just a little bulky for a two slice toaster.
4,Sleek stylish and very good!,"The toaster looks as good in person as it does in the pictures provided. The stainless steel coloring gives a very contemporary touch to any kitchen. The many settings (waffle, toast, bagel...) work perfect, and take the guess work out of configuring your toaster accordingly for each. The buttons have blue back lighting to them as well, which is a nice touch.The only thing that left me hanging high and dry was the handle on the toaster. It just has a very cheap feel to it. It hasn't broken and has never given me problems, but it just feels out of place on the rest of this beefy toaster."
4,No more forgotten toast,"I am not a toaster expert, but it does toast alot better then my old toaster. Best feature is the end of cycle alarm. No more finding abandoned toast the next morning. Design is a little over the top, which is why it got 4 stars."
3,"Extra long means 5-1/2"" slots","(Note: I have not actually toasted anything yet.) I ordered this because it said ""extra long"" slots. I was hoping rye bread (Kasanof's traditionally-shaped) would fit in it, but the longest slices in the middle of the loaf do not. I'm still deciding whether to keep it because the reviews I saw were better than other 2-slice toasters and it will work for some of the rye loaf, other breads, and bagels. I considered four slice toasters with 10"" slots, but the reviews are horrible for them."
4,Toaster Oster 6335,Have not used it more than twice but I think it will serve my purpose. I am putting the toaster in the travel trailer.
3,"Pretty good, but why is it so hard to find a good toaster","When I was a kid (I'm 40 now) we had a toaster that made good toast and lasted 25 years. This Oster 6335 is the 3rd new toaster we've tried. The other ones toasted one side but not the other, short circuited after about a year, or would toast fine one day and not the next. The Oster 6335 is okay, I bought it because Consumer Reports said it was the best and was a Best Buy. It's better than the other 3 but problems are:The darkness adjustment is too sensitive, changing from 3 to 4 on the scale goes from light to burnt toast. One side is always darker than the other. Even on the same side of the toast some areas are toasted and some are not. The handle that pushes down the toast seems flimsy and I know it will break after a couple years. Like I said this is the best out of the 4 (3 plus this one). But I'm not raving about it."
3,Good Toaster; Manual Incorrect; Warm doesn't Work,"This toaster works well enough--good, uniform toast. However, some the buttons do not work as specified in the manual; for instance, the manual says push Frozen first, then toast; but the Frozen light doesn't come on until you push the Toast button--stuff like that. The Warm function keeps toasting the bread, contrary to the manual and product description."
3,It's melting!,"The top of the plastic shell is MELTING! The plastic is just a cool-looking shell over a real toaster...so there is a gap where the crumbs fall down between. Not sure if that will be a problem later. Bought despite the ridiculous cost because Consumer Reports rated it highly. Not worth the $ if it's going to melt! The options are nice; I have used the ""warm"" setting several times when I couldn;t get to the toaster right away. The alarm is TERRIBLY LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS though!!!!!!!!"
2,Lovely while it lasted,"I had no complaints about this toaster, except that one month after the warranty expired (that's when the toaster was thirteen months old), it abruptly stopped working.Edited to add: I'm still unhappy with the toaster, but I'm now very happy with Oster; when I e-mailed them about the problem, they replaced the toaster for free!"
3,Not this one,"If you want a good toaster, that does what it is supposed to do, and will last, and does not look ridiculous, get the Kitchen Aid KMTT200. I have one, and it is the only toaster I have ever owned that works correctly. All the others have problems doing what a toaster is supposed to do. It costs more, but there is a reason. It WORKS. If you want gimmicks, and burned or white toast, get another one."
3,Works when its put together right,"First one the knob broke off, they sent a new toaster. The second one the left slot worked some of the time, it was returned. Ah the third one, yes it works but it works backwards. You turn it all the way down to burn your toast, and all the way up to make it light, Swell. We never did get the cancel button to work, but that is ok, we are old fashioned, we unplug it when not in use, that does the trip. Not very good quality control..."
2,lasted 16 months,"I purchased this stylish toaster after reading good reviews. It lasted 16 months and then the heating elements will now only warm things, at all settings. Why are so many toasters just junk and seemingly programed to die shortly after their guarantee expires? Very frustating. Beware!"
3,Pretty good toaster,"The Oster 6335 Counterforms 2 Slice Toaster is an okay toaster. It doesn't heat too quickly (a complaint we had of our other toaster). I put Muffin Tops for the granddaughters in the toaster as directed by the package and the zigzag grid caught the muffins and we had to use a table knife to break up the tops to get them out. I was, to say the least, disappointed."
5,Oster Toaster,I bought this toaster to fit in with the decor of my kitchen. It turned out to be a great buy. Makes perfect toast and the openings are larger to fit bagels.
2,Oster 6335,"Nice design except for the slots which limit the size of the bread to be toasted. Too small, necessitating cutting slices in half most of the time."
2,Oster 6335,"This product worked good while it lasted; however, one side of the burning element quit working after less than a year's use. When I bought it, it was a Consumer Report's Best Buy. I'm starting not to believe CR. This is several buys that have not turned out as advertised."
2,Was great while it worked,"I bought the toaster & matching coffee maker. I've had them both for about a year now and while the coffee maker is going strong, the toaster isn't. Oh sure, it works, if I want to hold the handle down myself and flip the bread from side to side. I'm very disappointed that this toaster didn't last very long. There are no children in this house, no one messing with appliances. Just woke up one day and couldn't make toast.Very unfortunate as I liked the longer slots for the type of bread I buy, but now I'm on the hunt for a toaster again. This is ridiculous. Why can't anyone make a toaster like they used to??"
2,Who Wired This Thing?,"This is just a piece of junk. It toasts unevenly and at times hardly at all. The fancy settings (bagel, waffles, etc.) don't mean much, as it doesn't seem to differentiate or be able to figure out just what it is toasting. It also takes a very long time to do what it thinks is the job. Bought this fairly recently and am so unhappy with it that I'm buying another toaster altogether. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Worse than factory cable.,"I bought this cable thinking it would have better construction and sheilding than the S-video to composite adapter that came with my Media Center PC. After more than a few tests and cable swapping, I could not get this cable to even match the video quality of the free adapter on my big screen standard def tv. I know it's my fault for trying to connect my non-hi-def screen in the first place, but the color washout and blotching are just unwatchable. Maybe I got a rare defective one, but I doubt it. I have no use for it now that I went back to the cheap adapter, which works just fine.If you're looking for my same solution and don't have an included adapter already, look for a cheap one."
5,Works Great!,I got this to connect my ATI Radeon 9600 Pro to my TV through this video cable and it works great. This cable is high quality and the input on the TV is crystal clear. Great S-video to RCA cable.
5,None better.,"These babies are universally hailed as THE surround speaker. I can't disagree. Their ability to envelope you in sound is amazing. Watching a movie that has any 'rain' scenes is a trip. You'll think you're getting wet!Given that enveloping ability, they are also superb at directional sound if need be.Simply put, if you're in the market for some new surround speakers. These should be at the top of your list."
5,A Classic from Beginning to End,"There are not too many albums in any genre that paint a consistent picture from the first note to the last. There are even fewer that do this in a hybrid style that is really something new and different. I bless Duke Ellington for bringing Abdullah Ibrahim to our attention, and I thank Mr. Ibrahim for giving us this joyous and colorful recording. The title describes the flavor aptly: the songs are alternately festive and languid, with slightly altered themes recurring throughout. When you play it, don't skip any cuts!"
3,My Review of LEARN...,This product seems to be one of great use to the beginning java programmer. It should make a great reference to look at for those learning java.
1,spoilt by a cancerous lesion on page 144,"page 144, 1977 reprint. Picture caption: ""The walnut harvest in the Dordogne in southwestern France. Nuts are beaten from the trees with long poles. There is an ancient saying that walnuts, dogs, and w*m*n are all improved by a good beating from time to time."" yeah he really spelt it ""w*m*n"" with the stars.The book is a tree dictionary + alot of info a gardener might need, like times of year of tree flowering, hardiness maps, etc. So you can probably find that stuff in another book, if you want to, and avoid the ""weirdo factor"" of this book."
4,Batteries & Flash,Bought 2 of these & gave 1 to a friend - Had flash problems right away & dealt w/ H.P.Support 4 times - They claimed batteries were the problem each time!After buying fresh rechargables locally twice w/ no improvement I got Sony batteries & it works perfectA great camera @ a low price w/ superb tech supportThank You
3,"Nice camera, except","I like the camera, don't get me wrong. It does a nice job taking pictures, movies and has a lot of storage with the SM card. Very easy to use, nice large display. The bad, be careful when you open the compartment that holds the batteries and storage card. The clip that holds the flap down is made of soft cheap plastic and breaks very easy. I have to use packing tape now to hold it together It should have been made of metal. If you take a picture or movie and use the zoom control wait 3-4 seconds before you take the picture or your image will be out of focus. I found out the hard way and missed a shuttle launch now I have a clip that is out of focus. The wife hates that it does not have a view finder, you have to look at the display to see what you are shooting."
1,Totally useless outdoors,"This is the first HP product we have ever regretted buying. This camera is totally useless outdoors in bright sunlight. You cannot see a thing on the LCD screen, even at its brightest setting, and the battery saving feature turns it off too soon while you are struggling to see the picture. Trying to use the zoom with a questionable live view is also impossible as you cannot find your target. The photos that do result appear to be OK, but you can't count on getting what you really wanted. We had to resort to our old HP Photosmart 935 camera on recent vacation - fortunately we took both along. Whoever decided that optical viewfinders should be eliminated is crazy. And, to not be able to recharge batteries without a dock is absurd while travelling. HP - rethink your line of cameras!"
1,Camera not worth the money,"It is extremely difficult to get a quality photo out of this camera. Nine out of ten photos are fuzzy. I've tried several different settings. After about a year of use I dropped the camera and broke it. My gain, I guess. I'll go back to my bulky sony until I can afford a new one. It won't be an HP."
3,Digital Camera,"The produc is very basic, the optical zoom (6X) doesn`t help to much specially in the night."
4,nice camera,I was very happy with the features and picture quality of this camera. Very nice zoom capability
4,"""Bouncy Fun"" is very different from ""Chillin' with Pingu"" and ""Meet Pingu""","We loved the two Pingus you can buy for American Region 1 DVD players (""Meet Pingu"" and ""Chillin' With Pingu""), so, in addition to other reasons, we bought a Region Free DVD player and ordered this Region 2 one. We wanted to get exposure to what all the European kids (and kids whose parents subscribe to cable tv with the Sprout channel apparently) can get too. But, oh no, Pingu has been updated! This DVD is computerized animation instead of the charming old fashioned claymation. The music is more computerized and ""zingy"" sounding and rock and rolly. It's not as charming as the accordion music, in my opinion. My 2 year old daughter is still quite mesmerized by it, but for all of you feeling deprived because you can only get the two older DVDs, it's ok, you have the better ones, I think. Pingu is still better than almost anything else out there for a 2 year old, I think."
3,Fairly decent but can be thinned out a bit,"Fairly decent overview of perimeter security. If your a security professional you may learn a thing or two, if your a network administrator and your idea of security is a firewall then this book is meant for you. Its a fairly easy read, but some of the examples of the commands to enter in configuring routers and hosts could be eliminated. I felt the author was just taking up space with these examples. (not a big deal but I'm taking a star away on principal) I also felt the author could have gone into a little be more detail in the VPN chapter, especially when dealing with encryption, PKI, and authenication which I felt was glossed over. (again not a big deal, but when you call yourself the definitive guide, be more definitive and save the 'commands' for the user guides"")"
5,"If you want to buy just one book, buy this one.","Stephen Northcutt has done a great job! this is the most comphrensive book on the subject. I particularly found the part on access lists very helpful. Niloufer Tamboly, CISSP"
5,Most compelling account of Hammerklavier,"If you want a Hammerklavier that literally hammers you, this is it! I've not heard a more cmpelling account of the Hammerklavier.With Gilels, it is Olympian but you feel he holds back a little. Richard Goode's Hammerklavier is a refined performance. Pollini hits all the notes but I find him lifeless. Brendel is about the next best. But for the best Hammklavier, I think this is incomparable.Superb recording. I hope that Ohlsson completes his cycle soon. His Chopin cycle is already superb. This issue looks extremely promising in an extremely compettive field. I have no doubt that it will go down as one of the greatest cycles.Try out his Appassionata, Waldstein if you haven't."
4,locking fuel cap,"I didn't really want a locking fuel cap. But it seemed to be the only type available when I searched. The cap works fine. Using the key is tedious. The key cannot be removed from the cap while the cap is removed from the fuel tank. If the key is attached to a key ring with other key the other keys interfere with locking and unlocking, so the key has to kept on a separate ring. Next time I won't get the locking variety."
1,BEWARE IF YOU NEED REPLACEMENT,"NEW GIVES YOU PROBLEMS IF THEY CANNOT REPAIR YOUR PRODUCT.THEY WILL NOT REPLACE IT AS THEY SAY,YOU WILL ONLY GET THE DEPRECIATED VALUE OF WHAT YOU BOUGHT.GOOD LUCK IN GETTING ANYTHING REPAIRED BY NEW OR ANYONE AUTHORIZED BY NEW.BECAUSE IT IS NOT BENFICIAL TO THEM WHEN THEY CAN JUST PAY THE DEPRECIATED VALUE OF THE PRODUCT.DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND PICK ANOTHER COMPANY THIS WAY YOU WILL NOT LOSE ANY MONEY OR TIME.THIS COMPANY IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHES AND AGGREVATION."
5,A new masterpiece from Judith!!,"I have enjoyed this band for quite some time and can tell that they have grown so much with the release of ""Play of Light"". The production quality is wonderful, the music is enthralling, and even the cover art is beautiful as well. I want two of this CD so I can frame one and listen to the other ~ it is so gorgeous!! The music is very well orchestrated and lovely to experience. This CD shows the many facets of Judith through all the different types of songs, which they prove to excel in. From pop to ballads to straight forward rock, this band can handle every angle of music with grace. The vocals will inspire many girls to swoon with their romanticism and the lyrics read like poetry. I was lucky to catch these guys playing in my area and hope to see them again soon. While you should go see them when they come to a city near you, in the meantime, buy this CD! You won't regret it!"
1,Truth or Fiction,If you really like Clint then don't bother with this bio. McGilligan paints Eastwood as a total bastard with no positive character attributes whatsoever. It's pretty much a total character assasination. There is some interesting info about his early career but there is an aweful lot of negative. Maybe that was McGilligan's intention to focus only on the negative and present Eastwood as a sod.
5,...,"This book is must reading for anyone who is curious about Clint Eastwood or for anyone who enjoys entertaining and enlightening detective work.If you see Eastwood walking down the street, don't ask for an autograph... run!"
1,Dragging Clint Eastwood through literary mud seems to be the author's objective,"I am a big Clint Eastwood fan, starting from a young age (my dad watched Clint's spaghetti westerns). I knew very little about Clint other than his movie characters until watching him being interviewed on ""Inside the Actors Studio"", which I truly enjoyed and would highly recommend. This motivated me to learn more about Clint, which is why I picked up this book. And then put it down and donated it after the first 20 pages. This book reminded me of the grocery store rags you find in the checkout aisle, full of speculation biased on what seems to be a determined effort on the author's behalf to drag Clint in literary mud. This book is so much about what the author thinks of Clint or imagines what might have happened. I'm giving Robert Schnickel's version a try, and while I'm not crazy about the writing style (paragraph-long sentences peppered with preposition phrases), it is undoubtedly a better biography."
5,Excellent car seat!,"We bought this seat for our first child because of the exra-thick foam padding. We are now using it for our second. Unlike the previous poster, I never had too much trouble adjusting the straps when rear facing. It was a little tight, but not that difficult to do. We have another seat that adjusts in the back, and you have to take the whole thing out to do it. It is easy to install and also to remove and wash the cover. I would definately buy this seat again and recommend it to friends."
5,Birds of the Puget Sound Region,Great book for helping you to identify all those interesting birds you enjoy seeing in your back yard! The pictures are as good as I have seen in any bird book and a lot better than most.
5,Excellent service - excellent books,"These bird books of specified regions are wonderful, very informative and have excellent pictures and text. We have the ""Birds of the Inland NW and Northern Rockies"" and love it which is why we sent the ""Birds of Puget Sound"" to our daughter. We can always count on Amazon to get us our orders on time as promised."
4,Amateur Birding,My family just recently put out bird feeders so there has been an influx of birds to our property. This is the perfect little amateur field guide!
1,Dud,"This book is full of ego ... a real show of off with overblown language and a story that isn't going anywhere ... an australian approapriation of magical realism ... I had to throw the book against the wall a couple of times. I did try to finish it, but couldn't"
2,Early History of Atomic Resarch (before WW II),"Annotation This work details the twenty years before World War I, when the greatest intellects of many countries brought the world it's first glimpse of the atom. Though the author focuses on Ernest Rutherford, many other notable scientists are included, such as Conrad Rontgen and Henri Becquerel. Other topics covered include: transmutation of Thorium, radiochemistry, and alpha particle scattering. This book is a part of the Science Study Series, a set of books created for the reliable teaching and study of Physics. Included in appendix are a helpful who's who list and a glossary of terms and symbols."
1,Emerilware Textile Set,"Placed this order back in April 05, with re-ordering every few months. If item has been discontinued, let me know. Otherwise, why hasn't this order shipped?"
5,It has been a year now and still holding up,After (1) time a week drum lessons and practice for (15) mninutes a night for 4 nights a week for an entire year the sticks are still in very good shape. This is our first purchase of drum sticks and drum pad for home practice.
1,would not waste my money again,a huge waste of money in my opinion. Doesnt even work for costume play much less angel costume. don't buy
4,"Elementary, Mr. Holmes","The 5-6 cuts featuring Red McKenzie are pretty horrible ( entertainingly so, though, like a Simpsons version of Al Jolson ) , but there is so much exciting invention going on that it doesn't matter. First, the guitar, is basically the Django-type stuff of the time, but played with more abandon, and with what I believe is a more clever musical sense : often you are built up to expect a cliche, and then WHOMP! a very original little line. Next, how many string bands can you name that used the tiple? And lucky for you, cos its great tiple playing! Another fun thing are the vocals (when they are covered by the band members) : perhaps the only scat music I can say I really appreciate, mostly because it doesn't riff without purpose, but has an odd, elliptical narrative quality, and again, is clever, light-hearted, and simultaneously urbane and slangy ( or, because that probably doesn't make sense, I'll say : It sounds like intelligent people acting stupid.)"
3,Expected better quality,"I expected mat to be stronger, not sure how long it will last with regular play. Grandson was happy with it."
3,big tub of dinosaurs,the dinosaurs are great! but the play mat not so great i thought it would be more durable. went to unfold it and it ripped my son was a bit upset. but other then the mat i love this and so does my son!
4,Mat is junk,"The Dinosaur's are great, but the mat that comes with the set is very poorly made! It curls up on the edges and I am not pleased with it at all. I would have returned it to the store, but my child loves dino's and I could not take that away from him."
3,Fun but smells toxic,"I got this set for my 4 year old and he loves it. The dinosaurs are colorful and there are a lot of them to arrange on the little background. I am happy with the number and look of the dionos, trees and volcanoes. However I give it only 3 stars because the background is small and very flimsy, and the set really smells bad. Every time we open the box there is a very strong unpleasant plastic smell coming from inside the box. Not sure if it's the box it's-self or the contents. I thought I would air it out a bit so I left the lid off over night, but when I entered the room in the morning the whole room smelled terrible from it. I really don't like the idea of my kid inhaling the fumes of some unknown plastic chemicals each time he opens the set so it now stays open and stored in the garage. We play with them outside and they work fine for that."
3,Nice Dinosaurs,"The dinosaurs in this set are great. The size is perfect for young and older children to handle. One previous poster said that the mat and other extras were cheap, and I have to agree with this comment. The mat isn't worth anything, so if you're buying this buy it for the dinosaurs alone. I was a little disappointed in the overall quality."
2,very disappointed,This product was very over-rated. It was a large expense for very poorly crafted items. And the picture that was with the advertised dinosaurs obviously had at least 4 times the amount that came in the plastic bucket. The little kid in the picture to the right of this review must be about 1 yr. old. He is very tiny. The dinosaur bucket and items are poorly represented in the picture and the description.
5,Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs - can't really comment on anything since it was shipped directly to our great-grandson, but his Nana says he loves it"
4,"Great dinos, poor background","The dinosaurs are great, my daughter is having a blast with them. The background plastic is cheap and thin, creased and won't lie flat. I am considering using spray adhesive and glueing it to a piece of wood cut to fit, or even a small table top. Then it won't crinkle and bunch as she plays."
5,if your into dinos get this,great for the girl or boy that has an interest in the creatures of the past. and has been watching Jurassic park on a loop
3,Dinosaurs are smaller than I expected.,"I thought these would be a size comparable to the ones you can purchase at Wal*Mart for eighty-eight cents a piece, but of nicer quality. They are actually much smaller. I also did not like the quality of the plastic ""scene"" you put them on. This could be made so much nicer. I would not purchase this item again."
4,Great!!!,"My son has a million dinosaurs, but it's never enough. He loves the accessories this tub came with. I only wish the mat was more durable."
5,GOT TWO!,If you are a dinosaur lover... get two... My 4.5 year old loves making dinosaur planet homes and spends hours building to have one come crashing in to reck it all! Hours of fun!
5,Hours of fun,"I bought this for my three year old son. He loves it. It comes with a plastic play mat and over 10 dinosaurs, plus trees, rocks and two volcanoes. He loves it and it entertains him for hours. But the best part for me is the plastic storage tub. Everything fits easily back in, and it takes up very little space (around the size of a large shoe box)."
4,It ROCKS!!!!!,"This playset is very reilistic and has lots of dinosaurs! It also has a reilistic mat that you can put your dinosaurs on! Set include my favorite dinosaur, T-rex!! Get this for your kiddos! The'll love it! :)"
3,Dinosaur Don't,"I was expecting a giant tote filled with all different kinds of dinosaurs, when in actuality, the majority of the ""toys"" were rocks and trees and volcanoes. Forget about the scenery...give me the dinosaurs! The dinosaurs are all weird colors and sizes, not at all what I expected from an Animal Planet toy. Did I mention that with this price, you are paying $2 per piece...that doesn't sound that unreasonable, until you realize 12 of the pieces are rocks...save your money, get the cheap set...at least then you won't feel like you got ripped off. Am returning the product today to get a more affordable dinosaur set."
2,Disappointed with the quality.,Picture makes it look like the mat is very large and well made. In reality the mat is not printed even with the same pattern and is made of a very thin plastic almost like plastic wrap. The dinosaurs are not that detailed and light weight plastic as well. For the money I was not happy with my purchase.
4,Very nice dinosaur toy set with one minor drawback,"My son loves dinosaurs and he was thrilled to receive this set as a gift. The dinosaurs are good size and with good details. There is no funny plastic or paint odors. The bucket is great for keeping all the pieces organized.The only thing that makes this less than a 5 star product is the play mat. The picture on amazon makes the mat looks bigger than it really is. It actually measures about 2 ft x 2 ft. It's made out of very thin plastic....similar to that of a grocery bag. Because it is so thin, it curls up and would not lay flat. After 30 minutes of gentle playing, the mat start getting tears. Otherwise, this is a great dinosaur set."
5,Dinosaur fun,4 year old grandson and I have many hours of fun. Different sizes for role playing. Set is durable and realistic with trees and rocks.
4,Nice set just wish it had a larger playing mat,My son had a great time with this set. The only thing I didnt' like about it was the play mat. I thought it was way larger it is pretty tiny. My son still likes it so I guess that is all that matters.
3,go back to drawing board for that landscape,"The dinosaurs in this set are fine. We especially noticed the malevolent gleam in the eyes of the T Rex, right out of the box. However, the vinyl sheet printed with trees, water and such is almost worthless. It insists on curling up into a tight roll at every corner unless weighted down. I can still remember a dinosaur set I had as a kid. In that one, the landscaping was formed plastic with actual hills and texture. The change to a printed sheet may help keep the cost down, but it also keeps the fun down."
4,"LOVE the dinosaurs, playmat is small & flimsy","My 3 yr old LOVES playing with the dinosaurs, I think they are well made. They are not too big so he can take them in the car, etc... The playmat is small (not like the picture) and is already ripped. I didn't buy it for the playmat so it isn't a big issue for me. I love that it came in a tub for easy storage."
4,Good for dinosaur grandchildren!!! LOL,This product seemed a bit high priced but the dino's are well made and will last forever. My grandsons use floor puzzles as a background rather than the flimsy plastic that comes with this but it has lots of pieces and will do for several children to play with at a time. I paper with names of different dinos would have been nice also. Overall good purchase.
2,Recommended age should not be 10 years and up,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew who is 5 years old - and since I don't have children of my own, the product details information is very important to me. Because it said Manufacturer recommended age is 10 years and up, I purchased this without hesitations. But when I received it, the box clearly says 3 years and up?? I'm sure my nephew wouldn't have minded, kids are kids. But I stil find it insulting to give 5 years old a gift that is meant for 3 years old and up.I wish this info was clear in the web as it was on the box, so that I would have bought something else instead. It sure caused me confusion and frustration.And no, I did not give this gift to my nephew, I ended up buying something else and donating this to the charity."
5,dinosaur fan,"My 3 year old son loves dinosaurs. This was the perfect gift! It has a wonderful assortment of different dinos, and they are well made.My 9 year old daughter loved it too. Even the box they come in is great. The only disappointment was the playmat that comes with it is easily torn. All in all this toy is worth the money."
5,Woody of toys,"My children now 2 & 4 years old got this toy for Christmas last year, 2001. It's now about a year later and they still play with this set. We're constantly picking up dinosaurs, or looking for dinosaurs because somebody wants to sleep with one or bring one in the car. They play with them in the sandbox, in their bed, in the car, and often is their toy of choice to go along when we're visiting somewhere. Most of our toys are played with once a month or less but the dinosaurs are an almost daily thing. Definitely got our moneys worth. The plastic playmat is not durable. Ours is not torn yet but it gets attention about once a month compared to the rest of the set's constant use."
4,Great toy! Small mat!,"I bought this toy for my 8-year-old boy who has developed an interest in all things dinosaur. It's a great toy with all the different dinosaurs, rocks, 2 volcanos and assorted vegetation. My only two complaints are... 1) the mat is extremely small. (The photo of the toy is very deceiving.) For all the stuff that comes in the tub, it should be about 4-5 times the size and 2) the way the top fits onto the tub is odd to me. It basically pushes on and and pulls off. However, what I guess is going to happen over time is the handle to the top is going to break off.Other than these two minor issues, I would definitely recommend this toy!"
4,"Don't be Misled by the word ""Big""","I purchased this toy for my Grandson's Birthday as he just loves Dinosaurs. When my shipment arrived I was initially shocked to see the size of the ""big"" tub of Dinosaurs which is the reason my overall rating was just 4 stars. My first thought was that I was glad I had not chosen to purchase the smaller package. That being said, the toy seems very interesting and I am sure he will have fun playing with the various pieces. I especially like that it comes in it's own storage compartment so overall I am pleased with my purchase."
4,Birthday Present,I bought this for my grandson who will turn 4 at the end of this month. He loves dinosaurs and I'm sure he will get a lot of play time out of this set. It is well constructed and the case makes it easy to take along on trips.
5,The coolest!,"Loved this set. My granddaughter has been interested in dinosaurs so we bought this in conjuntion with a book and had a blast with it. The dinos are a good size for small hands. There are lots of parts and kept her entertained for hours. The only complaint I have is the mat is just thin plastic sheeting, easily torn. We mounted on a large piece of cardboard to save it. Of course then its not so easily contained. One year later she still plays with it every day and it has held up beautifully."
3,Very Deceiving Pictures!!,"I bought this toy for my nephew for Christmas. Shipping was great, got here in a very timely fashion. The bad part was the pictures here on the website are very deceptive. The pictures show a big mat that is laid out and lots of dinosaurs. The mat itself is about 2 feet by 2 feet and very small and theres about 4 times as many dinosaurs and trees showing in the pictures. I was very disappointed. My nephew he did not notice this of course but I did right away. Felt very ripped off for the price I paid for a bunch of plastic. The toys themselves seem durable yes but there just arent very many of them. Wish there had of been more accurate pictures on the website. Thank God I had other things there as gifts."
3,Dinos,"It is enjoyed by my 2 year old,he loves dino.The tub is convenient ,but there are little pieces and the plastic land is garbage"
2,"Good, but not great.","My son bought this from Toys R Us with his own money. First thing he noticed after bringing it home was that the dinosaurs are different from what is shown on the tub and he wanted to toss the goofy looking mat, which is different from what is shown as well. Its not a bad set and he loves what is there, but since it is full of mostly ""rocks"" and trees, and also doesn't have exactly what we thought it would when we bought it, I feel bad that is all he got for his $[...]. I would definitely not pay the $[...] its currently going for here on Amazon."
4,Required reading for anyone considering a divorce.,"At last a practical, no nonsense, guide for those standing at the edge of the all too often frightening world of divorce. Years of experience by these two well-respected divorce lawyers are presented in clear, easily understood fashion; any one of the inside tips is well worth the price of the book. Getting divorced might not be pleasant, but it can be fair and amicable."
1,The smart Divorce,Good advise for the wealthy but not for those with a small estate. If I was to follow their advice neither of us would end up with anything to start over. The lawyers would take it all.
4,Updated Contours recorded in the motor city!,A very nice collection of updated recordings of classic Contours hits and more. Recorded in the early 1990's with an all star Detroit band. Original Contours Joe Billingslea and Sylvester Potts lead the way. The late Johnny Kidd shines on Keys while the solid Bass playing of John Barron keeps things moving while recreating those classic James Jamerson grooves.
3,Has Lara St.John reached her Peter's Principle?,"There is a common say that, soon or later, one reaches his/hers level of incompetence. I have been following Lara's career, starting with her first and amazing CD some years ago. This is her third record and I have heard it several times in search for her well known art and virtuoso.What I found, specially in the sonata, was crystal technique but an absense of art. And this is what music is all about.The concertos are a far resemblance of the vigor and beauty shown in her first CD. There is no doubt that Lara is an amazing performer, but something must be wrong with the way her art is maturing.Her website stopped displaying her schedule two years ago. What's next?"
2,Anemic despite facile technique.,"Nevermind the tacky, come-hither CD cover art. If there's something fresh and genuinely captivating to offer, the CD can look like last week's leftovers, for all I care. Lara St. John's critical acclaim on previous CDs notwithstanding, I find very little here to capture my attention. Her Bach is tossed off with facility, but she barely skims the surface of these concertos. Technical virtuosity and speed are one thing, but a deep understanding of the music seems to escape Ms. St. John. She rushes through all works with the same nervously hurried pace and reading, never resting for the briefest moments to allow for a significant pause. The three violin concertos all suffer a fate of sameness--even between movements. The G Minor Sonata lacks a certain intensity and gracefulness. Well, it might be fastfood Bach, but at least it's J.S. Bach, which accounts for the two stars."
3,"Better tan others, but still too much white noise.","TV Ears work better than a more expensive brand we bought before, but the white noise is ever present. They are comfortable, though."
5,Jan's Fan's,"This product is great in a room with poor acoustics or in a home with a nightowl, both of which apply here. You can turn down the sudio completely on the t.v. and each person can adjust their own volume to their liking. If someone is sleeping (children etc.)they won't be bothered by the noise."
1,Flaws and more Flaws,Bought these for my grandparents because they saw it on some magazine. I had to return it twice because of flaws. The first one didn't line up with the charger so it wouldn't charge. Second one wouldn't even turn on. The third one worked but not worth the trouble and money. Sound quality is horrid and not comfortable. My grandparents asked me return it again...
3,"works, but not for long","This could be an excellent product, for helping make TV sound clearer -- and it is -- but only for a whort while. It is too fragile and breaks too easily (the point where the thin plastic bit meets the base). We've been through a number of them."
2,This unit does function as well as original,This replacement for my original TV Ears unit does not function as well as my original. It tends to fade out and has periods of static.
1,Piece of junk. Warranty no good. Not for digital TV,"They doubled the price, but TV Ears is still a piece of JUNK! Doesn't work with my digital TV's -- only analog. Had to buy another headset when TV Ears snottily refused to honor the warranty after the earpieces broke. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this piece of crap."
4,TV ears,Terrific for those of us who need help with hearing the tv without blasting others out of the room. The pads on the ear part bother me but there are some u can purchase on the same site that work better for me.
4,TV Ears Headset,"Replacement headset works well. We try to keep 2 available at all times so that if the battery in one needs charging, my husband can use the second headset. The headsets are somewhat fragile and have limited range."
5,Great for the elderly,"TV Ears Headset SystemMy mother is 91 years old and extremely hard of hearing. After hearing aids (that she did not like and won't wear) and numerous other hearing devices we found TV Ears Headset System. Her first words were ""I can hear every word"" and this with the television at normal level, even if the volume is turned completely down she can still hear and not miss a word. These are a real live saver.If only we could find something that would allow a conversation with her that work this well."
3,Could be better,Both my husband and I have used the TV ears not so much for volume but for clarity. It is difficult to understand dialogue when TV personages enunciate so poorly and speakers on the TV set could be better. The problem is that shabby manufacturing make it difficult to maintain contact when the sets are in the charging stand. They do not sit securely and do not charge properly much of the time.
4,TV Ears Review,"It does exactly what it says it does. For someone with hearing problems it provides clear sound in both ears. It has 2 weaknesses: 1. The battery does not last long enough and it is subject to interference from computers, etc."
5,Best purcase I've made,"I originally bought the t.v. ears for my dad. He has hearing loss and wears oxygen at all times. We tried other amplifier devices but all he could hear was the oxygen blowing! The t.v. ears are amazing, all he can hear is the t.v. My mom tried them out just for grins and could hear much better. She especially liked how clear the words were and that the commercials don't blare like they do when just listening to the t.v. So we bought her her own pair. Each set has it's own volume control, excellent idea! What's also excellent about these things is you can still hear everything in your environment, including someone speaking to you at a normal volume. So worth the money. My parents are now able to watch t.v together again, the first time in 5 years!"
2,Mechanically defective,"The volume control is erratic. Sometimes it works and other times it just cuts out. Refurbishment unsatisfactory. Other than that, it is great for my purposes."
2,Mixed Opinion,"After getting a glowing report from a friend, I ordered a set although I thought the price was high. Received the set and make the following observations. The whole unit looks and feels cheap. The quality is similar to something one might find at a Dollar Store for a fraction of the price. Attempted to charge the headset in the included charger but unless the headset was placed ""just so"" it wouldn't make contact. I returned the item to Amazon the next day and received a full credit.The concept is great..... wireless headset, no cord stretching across the room, etc. but for the price it should be made to a much higher standard."
4,TV Ears,"Purchased TV Ears for my mom. She really didn't want them, but loves them now. He comment was that, ""I can finally hear the words"". It can be hard to set on the charger, but have found that you just gently set it and don't force it. Only time there was interference sound was when there wasn't a clear line of site from the ears to the transmitter. Against the advertisement, if the mute is on the tv, there is no sound in the TV Ears. Overall, great product."
1,poor quality,"The volume switch comes loose and freely spins I called company and they had me place it back in it's slot, easy to do but this has continually happened, at least 4 times in 3 weeks. I have made 3 calls to company and they promise to send me a fix, a small screw to hold the switch in place has not arrived in 1 week am going to call again and complain."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,I actually give this product a 4 star rating over all because the mechanics of it are much to fragile. The ear horse shoe breaks very easily so you have to treat it wuth more than average care. Keep away from kids. Sound quality is superb for voice clearification. The charger is somewhat mickey mouse as it can shift and stop charging the head set.
1,Replacement TV Ears ordered through Amazon Didn't Work - Not Sure Why,"I previously ordered a replacement ""TV Ears"" headset a year or two ago, that worked fine. These, however, do not work (only static). I'm not sure why they don't work & am unfortunately too busy to troubleshoot the issue. In their defense, I have not contacted them to complain or anything. They're probably a good company & my product is either defective or some setting is off that I can't figure out easily."
5,Wireless Headphones,I purchased this extra headset because the battery charge lasts only a few hours (my wife says about 4 hours) and my wife can switch to the second set to finish watching her recorded programs without waiting for the set she was wearing to recharge.
5,Treble range,"Overall, I am very satisfied with the product. I have a hearing problem. It would be helpful if the treble range were greater than present. It is quite comfortable to wear due to light weight.It would be much more economical if the headset arms could be purchased and installed by the user instead of buying a whole headset."
4,MAGIC EARS,"I""VE USED PRODUCT FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS. I LIKE NOT HAVING TO RAISE THE VOLUME BECAUSE I AM HARD OF HEARING BUT I WOULD LIKE A MORE COMFORTABLE EARPIECE AND I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE WING BREAKING. BUT THE ABILITY TO HEAR MAKES UP FOR MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS."
4,TV Ears,These are the best ones I've gotten and they are still working!! And that is great. They are not cheap and this is the 3rd set I've had to buy/
2,Not worth the price.,Purchased this headset to replace existing headset that broke. The stems to the earpiece are very flimsy and tend to brake at that point. Not guaranteed and certainly not worth the price.
2,Too much static.....not balanced right....unable to balance sound,"I have bought TV ears in the past and did not have any problem with using them. They enhanced the sound exactly as I needed it to watch TV. After a few years of use, one side of the TV ears snapped off. So I ordered a new pair. This new pair does not deliver the sound that I need. I hear a lot of static and background noise. The balance also seems to be off. I am spending more time fiddling with them than enjoying my TV programs. Also the ears are tighter than my previous pair. I am ready to send them back but I don't want to be without anything at all to help with watching TV. There were no instructions with these to help with adjusting the balance or to get better reception."
2,Not up to expectations,"This new (expensive) head set is very tight. I am trying to be cautious in putting them on or off because they were purchased to replace a set that snapped when being placed on.. As i tried to get used to the pressure they exerted on me I found that they don't hold a charge very well.( after a few hours of evening TV the sound fades and disappears). I will probably return them, but of course that's a time consuming hassle."
2,W'Happened?,"They didn't work. All I heard was static.Also, where was the packaging slip?Oh, well. Stuff happens.It has been returned and received."
2,Planned Obsolescence,"There's a reason that there are so many places selling REPLACEMENT headsets.While the system solves the problem of understanding dialogue without high volume, the structural design is poor.My first set of earphones broke where the ""arm"" attaches to the electronic module. I talked to the maker about repair parts - nope just spend about $70 for a new headset.Did that and was much more careful with them. They broke too after less than a year. Being an engineer, I take things apart. Found the ear pieces could have been made replaceable with slight modifications, but NO they glue them and solder them in to make repair very difficult. The breakage prone location could also easily be reinforced in manufacture, but again - NO.I contend it is planned failure to support sales."
2,static,this is my second pair of t.v. ears. the first pair were great. this pair has a lot of static when you are listening to them. the voices sound muffled. I am not pleased with them this time. probably shopuld return them.
4,TV Ear,"The product was delivered in a timely manner and was recieved in new condition. The product could be a little sturdier, as one of mine broke as I was expansding it to put on.to purchase a replacement, at this time would be too costly.The broken one is NOT the new one."
2,Would not work!!,I received the TV EARS Replacement set's and they would not work. It sounded like wind blowing when you started them. I don't understand why but they were of no good to me so I returned them.
2,disappointed,The shipping was great however the produnct did not work...return the product and was really disappointed because my wife has is hard of hearing
2,work great - until they break!,"The product works very very well. We recommended it several times to others. Then, after 8 months of use, the headset broke at the base of the piece that sits on his chest. We figured it was our fault. Purchased another one. Same problem after only 7 months of use. Broken in the EXACT same place. I called the company, who offered to sell me another one at half price plus shipping. Pay for more defective products? I don't think so. . ."
2,Reception,"Products work fine as long as you can see TV. If you go into the door way of another room is shuts down. Basicly you have to stay infront of TV to work. I have other types before and I could go on to deck, in the bathroom, computer room and still listen to the TV. I have watch a different TV in another room and listen to another. So my complaint is must be with 12-15 feet of TV to work.TV Ears 10321 2.3 Replacement Headset"
1,wrong item received,I ordered a replacement set of ear phones (95 KHZ) and received a different model which does not work with my transmitter. I have been unable to find a replacement.
1,TV Ears,"I was having a problem locating the proper inputs on my TV, so I called customer service.They told me how to attach the unit. I did exactly as they told me, however, when I turned the earpiece on, it would not sync with the channel I was watching. I heard a radio program through the earpiece. The customer service representative explained that I must be near a transmitting tower and that I would have to purchase a more powerful earpiece. I wasn't about to do that. I asked the customer service person if this was a common issue. She said yes.In addition, the earpice was not comfortable and did not really fit into my ears very well.The product is terrrible! Don't buy it!"
1,Poor product,"This product is poorly designed, because it doesn't completely dissolve. After a few weeks, you end up with this blob of blue gel stuck to the bottom of your tank. Even after a few more weeks, your tank's water is almost completely clear and the blob is still there, so you have to go in and remove it yourself."
4,Good product - does the job,"This product does the job and keeps the toilet bowl clean. When I don't see the blue color in the bowl anymore, I know it's out. I use these inbetween really thorough cleanings and the bowls stay nice and clean.I would have given 5 stars based on the performance, but docked one since as a previous review stated the tablets do not completely disolve and you have to remove the little pieces eventually. Considering the good job they do and that they are bleach free, I still would buy more of these."
1,want my money back,"The tablet is not easy to be dissolved! It DOESN""T prevent stains!! and leave blue stains which is SOOOOOOOO HARD to clean!! I want my money back!!!!!"
3,Wilbert,"These shoes proved to be longer in size than I anticipated and I had to send them back. As noted elsewhere Amazon charges you for returning shoes which seems a littleunfair. Given that it often takes trying on two or three shoes at a shoe store to get the right fit Amazon may wish to adjust there policy.Nevertheless, the price is so good on AE shoes that it is worth the risk. The Wilbert is a sturdy shoe but not really a comfort shoe and has a hard feel to them. I own several pair of AE shoes and like them all.I remain a fan of AE shoes but a little less of a Amazon fan."
5,Another perfect shoe by ALLEN EDMONDS,"As expected another comfortable shoe by A E, it does run heavier than reguler shoes, but I got used to it in a couple days.As all the other A D shoes I have previously bought, I highly recmmend the wilbert moc toe ."
1,great shoe but seek a real shoe seller for fitment,"this is a great shoe and I'm sure I'd love it and wear it if I was able to get a proper fit without spending an arm and a leg on shipping, for an already expensive item it seems Amazon is really dropping the ball regarding customer service in this market, that makes is very difficult to give a proper review of the product which I'm sure I would love had I gone in to a shoe seller and skipped the whole mail order nonsense that has tainted my experience with this purchase.in conclusion, this is a great product, do not buy it online from anywhere unless you are prepared to spend a lot of time returning and reordering until you find what works exactly."
5,Works fine.,"I used this to replace a plastic wall plate that had cracked, and a portion of it fell off. This metal plate solved my problem perfectly."
1,Biblical values absent,"If you are a believer in Jesus Christ and seek to glorify God with your life, skip reading Passup Point. I decided against finishing it due to the profanity included and the apparent direction the book was going to take involving the priest in lusting after a minor and then fornication with another woman in the community. God does not consider sin entertaining and therefore I am choosing not to finish this trash for entertainment."
3,Passup,"I should have passuped this. It was all right, but not one I would care to read again. Kind of slow moving in parts."
1,paasup point,not impressed with it. Good story line that could have been written into an impressive story. Definitely not impressed how christianity can be so cheapened.
2,Not what I expected,"I got this book on my Kindle hoping for a solid, Bible based Christian story. Although the story was interesting and the book was easy to read I didn't appreciate some parts of it and some beliefs in the books (f.e. sex outside of marriage). So if you are a feel-good, all-religion-is-good person, you might enjoy it. If you truly believe what the Bible says and try to live what Jesus Christ preached and lived, you won't like it. I was particularly disappointed by the ending, where the main character literally says about two unmarried people living together: ""But here in Passup Point, it's not a sin. As long as we love each other, and I have no doubts about that, it's just plain living."""
4,Smells better than the others,We were glad to find this pre-shave for my husband. All the other scents (including the original Afta scent) all smell the same and honestly are nauseating.
3,A quick Read.....,This little quickie offers little in new information about England's infamous Monarch. It only took me a few hours to read. Stick to Allison Weir or David Starkey
5,Great concert!,"I don't have much to add to the previous review - this is a magnificent concert featuring the great Natalie Cole and ""America's Choir,"" the great Mormon Tabernacle Choir. I also own this on CD. The Choir is always a treat to hear, but particularly at Christmas time, and when teamed with a performer like Natalie, the results are fantastic!"
3,most wonderful time of the year,"ah hum-bug this concert was a watered down, lack lustered performance of two of our greatest icons, there just was'nt any pazzaz or holiday cheer"
3,"Fun, for a minute","I got this for my teen to punch on, as he likes monty python. It was fun and clever for one day, and then it got a hole, and has not been used since. It seems to be made more for light use and amusement than actual punching."
2,Doesn't stay upright when knocked down,"If you give it a punch and knock to the ground, it will not stand back upright...seems to be not enough sand in it."
2,It's just a sand wound ...,"My son loved this bop bag - all 3 of them. It appears they are very poorly constructed as the seal - or whatever holds the sand in place on the bottom, always breaks and the sand escapes inside the bag rendering the bag completely useless since it will no longer ""stand"" back ""up"" once hit. The first one we had developed a small hole in it first. It was repaired using a repair kit, but then the sand broke loose shortly after.I contacted Toy Vault for the 3rd time (3/14/09) regarding this, but it was too late as this item is already out of production.On the plus side, the voice box never broke."
5,surprisingly great.,"i really didn't expect much from this product. In fact, i left it in the box in my yard all winter. The weather here finally improved, so I decided to break it out and see if it would really work. to my surprise, i found myself spending an hour hitting forehand after forehand. it really works and helps improve consistancy of strokes and allows you to really hit out on your shots. a great investment for those who like to swing a racket and smash a tennis ball."
1,Doesn't seem to return the ball as advertised,"I don't know how others get this to work right. I put this on a metal pole (a basketball backboard support) that should have worked just fine, but the ball doesn't seem to return well. It really loses steam as it unwinds and stops before it completely unwinds. Not at all as shown. I got this so my young son could learn to hit the ball, but if I can't get it to return when hitting it hard, there is no way he will."
1,Jarani,The advertising was not clear as to what your getting; it does not include the stand for the ball assembly!
4,Flawed but interesting very early silent feature,"Well made silent melodrama, of some historic import.The acting is generally quite good and understated for the time, the cinematographyhas some nice lighting effects, and moving shots (and one amazing close up, wherethe camera shakes with a character's anger).On the other hand, the melodramatic story feels predictable, along with havinga giant plot hole at its center, and some other annoying, easily avoided contradictionsand logic gaps.Certainly this story -- a struggling Italian immigrant and his bride in the slums ofNew York, coming to America to fulfill their dreams, but finding disillusionment anddespair -- must have resonated with a lot of people at the time. I just wish the storyhad the subtlety of the acting and images.But this is a good, solid, important early film, for film lovers and film students."
2,What's that smell?,"The bag is beautiful and functional, but it arrived with a bugspray-type odor that has made it impossible for me to use. The smell fills my car and gives me a sore throat--so I definitely don't want it around my baby. Professional cleaning cut the smell by about half, but it's still too stinky to use."
2,The middle ground.,"Everyone seems to either love this CD or hate it. I have a third opinion: This is a truly average band, playing truly average music, with influences that are painfully obvious, & ability that doesn't quite master those influences. In other words, just like 100,000 other bands who either never got record deals or distribution or airplay or publicity. The difference is that these guys GOT all those things, so we know they exist. Anyone who was hanging out in rock bars a few years ago heard these guys virtually every night under a different name every night, & it was fine, -for the circumstances-. Apparently many of the reviewers here have never heard such bands. Now you have."
1,Wow....,"I didn't think it was possible for music to be this bad, but I've been proven wrong. These guys seem to lack a basic knowledge of how to play their instruments, the lyrics are trite, and the vocals of the lead singer make the preverbial ""cat stuck in a blender"" sound like a pleasant audio alternative. Unless you are into sadism stay away from this one, your ears will thank you."
2,This not the Review but for those who want the soundtrack,"The soundtrack to the movie ""Boondock Saints"" Can be ""sampled"" at the --Boondock Saints Fan Site--"
1,"Love the Movie, Hate the Band","I bought this album knowing it wasn't the soundtrack (who like everyone else I still want). Still i purchased it based on the reviews of the others who had. After I got the album I would frequently use it to entertain my friends. Who, like I, thought it was hilarious. I seriously can't see what anyone would find in this to dictate a rating of 2 stars, even more absurd giving it 5. My biggest gripe with the actual sound would be that the lyrics are corny. Eveything else is ok, but to anthem rock for my tastes. Before you spend earned money on this, I strongly urge you to find a song from the cd off Kazaa and make sure its for you.Finally for all you guys who loved this cd, check out Floater. Download ""exiled"" off their website. Then my friends you will have witnessed music worth 5 stars."
1,Extremely Bad...Terrible...Probably worst album ever,"Boy, this is some pretty awful music. Take Alice in Chains and remove any hint of any talent whatsoever and you'd be left with a masterpiece compare to this. Phony, boring, pathetic, just plain bad. Did I mention this CD is awful? God, this is terrible. How was this made. Who heard this band and thought ""hey, that'd be a pretty swell band to bring up to the execs!"" Somewhere out there, there's an ex-record company crony who is working in a different field because he or she thought that producing this musical vomit was a good idea. I'm now going to go and listen to nails scratching a blackboard to cleanse my ear canals."
3,Pretty good.,"I like this CD. I am a big fan of the movie, and I have found that ""Holy Fool"" is on the soundtrack."
5,The Saints lyrics should be viewed as scripture,"Release the Hounds is simply unbelievable. This music brings rock back to the forefront by using the guitar in a way that can only be compared to the more seasoned rockers of the past 30 years. This collection has both great hard guitar songs such as Holy Fool and Mrs. Hammerstein's Test, as well as harmony songs like Two Ravens and Three Stones that prove these guys can diversify their talents and still put out a CD worthy of everyone's listening. If you are a fan of great music and want to hear songs that will have you wearing out your CD player, the The Boondock Saints should be a staple in your collection."
1,help,"In one word, terrible, I don't understand why the album is sold out in stores unless they were only given limited copies, I've downloaded several songs, it all sounds the same, you think they could pick it up a little?"
4,Boondock Saints music is for the Fans not dumba$$ critics,"If you are a Big Fan of the Boondock Saints I movie, then you are going to like this CD. Heck, I bought it just for the song, ""Holy Fool"" (remember this was playing when Rocco did his thing in the Lakeview Restaurant). Not every song of any musician's CD is always great. Usually there is 2 great songs, some good/ok songs, and some bad filler. Even the Rolling Stones and Zeppelin put songs on CD's that stunk. I really don't understand the hate generated toward this CD, unless they have a grudge against Troy Duffy, like some puny, little, 5th grade, ""Nancy"" boys."
3,not the soundtrack,"okay to first make clear that i do know that i am a huge BOONDOCK SAINTS fan (the movie), i am personally responsible for sharing this movie with damn near everyone i know, i know the movie by heart and own it on 2 dvd's just in case....i know it all by heart...and i state this or may both dvd's break..this is NOT I REPEAT NOT...the soundtrack to the movie, there are a couple songs that sound like it but not all.....it wasa valant effort by all by just a lil short...sorry to disappoint everyone"
5,GREAT MUSIC!,"This band is really 'keeping rock alive.' Taylor Duffy has a great voice. Not that bad, tone shot, just plain annyoing voice you hear on most of todays new music. This band has the potential of reaching the top. I hope to hear a lot more of them, and hope to see them tour in the New York area so I can see them! Three Stones is the greatest song. Along with Invinvible, Later On, Mrs. Hammerstiens test, Over, and the hit action scene (from the movie) song Holy Fool. This guys really rock. They kicked it up a notch.... As Emeril would say, ""BAM!"""
4,Much Better Than Reviews Give Credit For,"Simply put, this is above average music that strikes a chord with fans of the Boondock Saints film franchise. This album is not painful to listen to, in fact it is a great mellow-to-hard rock album that rarely lets down. Great tunes like 'Holy Fool' really make up for any lack of depth and lyrical content that some other reviewers may have complained about.Though not perfect, there are enough good tracks on this album to satisfy the palette. However, there is little that leaves you wanting more."
2,"Solid structures and playing, but goes nowhere new.","It just feels predictable. Nothing about this is envigorating, or fun, it just feels studied and reapplied. While being derivative doesn't dismiss the quality of someone's work it can take away credibility and passion as well as creativity and that's where this album lacks. Talent wasted by sitting in chairs copying, instead of getting up and experimenting and rocking out. I feel in every way when listen to the Cd, and have deja vu of it whenever I think of the fact the lead singer made the movie of the same name which is in the same league cinematically as this music. Tired, derivative material."
3,The Soundtrack?,"I haven't listened tot he band, but I loved the music ni the movie, but WHY can't I get my hands on the soundtrack?"
1,Please.....,"one must be brain dead to give this anything more than 1 star. I personally feel sorry for the 690 folks that actually laid out $$$ for this. While the band may have been good live (I dunno), absolutely zero of that translated to disc. Sucks, period."
1,No,This is the worst. So bad. So. So. So. So. So bad. Overnight is good. This is not god. This is bad. More badness per minute than possibly anything else. Ever.
5,Really fast shipping,"I am very happy to have found this product, after looking in drugstores at home for the last several months. The company shipped the bottles very quickly, and I had them just a couple of days after I ordered."
3,perry mason season 4 vol. 2,I like it very much. However it is too costly and there is no extra features like subtitles.
1,perry mason,The case was busted on arrival. It is one of those multiple cases so I can't replace it. The videos themselves are fine for now. But I suspect sliding around in the case over time they will get damaged.
2,Mason is great but it's a rip off,"I love Perry Mason and this portion of the series is no exception, it's great. BUT, CBS TV is ripping us off. This segment has only 12 episodes on it! When other TV series feature a whole year's worth of episodes, Perry Mason's producers or whoever owns these rights has divided them up to make more money and it's a real turn off. Over $30 for just 12 episodes is just greed."
4,Perry Mason wins again,Have collected this set since the beginning. Just hope this doesn't end like the VHS series did (just stopped with no notice). Video quality on these sets equals or even betters the VHS tapes. My only problem with this series is the breaking up of the seasons into two sets. Would gladly pay more to get complete seasons. Keep them coming.
3,"Perry Mason: Season four,vol 2",I love the Perry Mason series and always can't wait to get the next one. I usually pre order them. I have not had any problems with the other volumes but this set won't play in one of our dvd players-the others will. So we still have been able to watch this volume on our other player we were disappointed it wouldn't play in the room we wanted to watch it in. That is the only reason for 3 stars instead of 5.Mary Ebert
5,Classic TV at its best,"Old cars, unknown actors and compelling plots, even if the legal moves might be suspect. Good and believable cast too."
3,enjoyable,I really enjoyed watching this movie. I would buy this movie again because it was better then what i thought that it would be.
5,Beautiful Collection of Poetry for Children,"This collection of poetry, especially designed for those putting together a curriculum for children, does all the work of finding important, interesting and beautiful works for children to study or memorize from the simplest verses for young tots ""The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings"" to more complex works for high school (such as ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" by John Keats) that include study questions and an answer key. This is a true treasure especially for homeschool parents and teachers - it's so comprehensive and easy to use.It's not the only poetry book you should own (there certainly is a place for beautifully illustrated poetry books to pick up for pleasure reading as well), but it is a real gem and a great value."
1,Customer service (or lack thereof),"I have contacted them with a question and waited 4 days, still with no response. Do not be fooled by their name, they are not at all Customer Service oriented. I am cancelling immediately because this is a signal to me that they will be just as unresponsive were I ever to make a claim on this extended warranty."
1,Stay away from this one!,"There are so many ordinary errors, examples of bad reasoning, and sheer leaps of faith in this volume, it astonishes me that Genealogical Publishing Co. reprinted it. The Magna Charta barons all can be picked up from Cockayne and Weis; if you start with Browning, you'll just have to do it over. To be avoided!"
4,No taste at all,This iron has really helped my anemia. It doesn't have any taste or after taste and is very easy to swallow. I have not noticed the side effects that my doctor warned me I might experience with an iron supplement.
1,I received expired tablets.,I received expired tablets. These people even do not check expiry date of medicine before shipping.
5,slow fe,Slow Fe Slow Release Iron Tablets 90-Count BoxThe item received was exactly as prescribed; and on a timely basis.
2,good product - but,Easily tolerated iron preparation. The childproof packaging they use is very frustrating for adults to open and should be changed into a product that a resonably adept adult can open without resorting to having to cut the package open with scissors.
5,SLOW IRON / FAST RESULTS,I HAVE BEEN TAKING THIS IRON SUPPLEMENT FOR 5 MONTHS AS PRESCRIBED BY MY DOCTOR. IT HAS HAD ONLY POSITIVE BENEFIT AND NO NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS. I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN A WEEK.
1,iron pill is NOT FOR EVERYONE,"i was told to take these for borderline anemia because these are supposed to be the best and least-upsetting to the stomach. well, after just taking it for two days, i had a terrible reaction to it, felt nauseated and could hardly eat for a week - i seriously thought i had iron poisoning or something. your body is supposed to be good at regulating iron level, so maybe it was just too much for me since my body was fine with my iron level.this is supposed to be the best iron pill, but it definitely wasn't good for me. i highly recommend that you research and investigate before taking iron pills."
1,NOT as described,"The description lists these pills as 50 mg elemental iron equivalent to 160 mg ferrous sulfate. My doctor prescribed 160 mg ferrous sulfate so I thought this was perfect. Imagine my surprise to find on the box they are actually 45 mg elemental iron equivalent to 142 mg of ferrous sulfate. The box says ""new formula"". Amazon you need to update your descriptions!"
3,Be careful if you're diabetic,"These are decent iron tablets but be careful if you're diabetic. My wife took these and for a while she was getting unexplained peaks in her blood sugar overnight. When she stopped taking the supplement, the peaks also stopped. Turns out that lactose is one of the top ingredients."
4,Much better than generic,"OK, so I tried to save some $$ by getting the generic at my local store. Big mistake.Went back to the doctor and he recommended this brand by name, so I ordered it here because it was cheaper than my drug store.I am on my second box now and it has made a world of difference in how I feel and in my test results. I always thought generics were just the same as the name brands, but that is not the case for this supplement. I will be buying this brand again"
2,Totally ridiculous packaging,I switched to another brand because the packaging was totally ridiculous. You need a set of barb wire cutters to get to them.
5,Haven't been able to find it in the Local Drugstores,"I have been using this product on Doctor recommendation for a while now, it is getting very hard to find the 750MG in our local drugstores, so I am very pleased to be able to get it here!"
2,"Been taking for 6 weeks, NOT Flush Free",I've been taking this supplement daily for about 6 weeks now and I can tell you that it is definitely not Flush Free. The dosage might be too high to not cause flushing. I am very good about taking it with plenty of food and yet about 4 hours later the burning and redness really hits me hard. It seems to affect me 5 out of 7 days.The flush is intense and lasts for about 10-15 minutes and then gradually fades away. I'm going to try a different brand and maybe a smaller dosage (2x a day) as it gets pretty annoying. One night while getting ready for bed it was really bad and I had to talk a cold shower. I just want to warn those out there who think there won't be any flushing and to consider this prior to purchase. I was hoping that my body would be used to it by now... guess not.
3,Oldies Christmas album,good one with some old classics; bought it on review by a Christmas show while I was in New Orleans
5,Gotta Love the Holidays,"Very happy with the CD. Nice, well-known holiday songs on it by Michael Buble and Celine Dion (2 of my favorites). Came sooner than anticipated - happy with the vendor."
2,"pretty, but...","I think that this collander came with a warning not to put it in the dishwasher. Well, one day I forgot. Putting it through the dishwasher took all the shine off of it and also left lighter-colored spots."
2,"Looks great, but....",...item arrived with a dent on the inside. Which is causing the paint to peel. Not sure if it will tarnish. Disappointed!
2,Nausea even when taken with food,"I have taken this for about 3 weeks every other day. Some days I feel fine after taking it, other days I feel horrible for about 2 to 3 hours afterward. There doesn't seem to be a consistent combination as half the time it makes me sick and half the time it doesn't whether I've eaten first or not. I haven't vomited from it but have spent much time thinking I was going to. The nausea is eerily similar to morning sickness. I'm done with this vitamin."
1,Nausea,"I am relieved to hear that others have experienced nausea from this product. Regardless of if I take it on a full stomach or not, I feel nauseous for about an hour or two after taking it."
2,Made me nauseous,"I tried taking this multi-vitamin in a variety of ways - with & without food. In all cases, a wave of nausea comes over me to the point where I think I'm going to be physically sick. So far, I haven't, though. I did some research on the internet - and everyone seems to think the answer is ""be sure to take with food or a meal"". Thank you, I've done that and it doesn't help."
1,This vitamin made me sick,I have been taking generic brand vitamins every day for the last two years without ever getting sick. I have been taking this vitamin after eating either breakfast or dinner and often feel nasueous. I have vomited on 3 occasions and will be discontinuing the use of this vitamin.Good luck
1,This made me sick,"I took One-A-Day Women's for three days, and each day I felt sick until the third day in which I actually threw up. Apparently, this is a common problem that consumers have experienced, but there is no disclaimer on the bottle. I contacted the company, and they got back to me that same day to get more information about my situation. They said they do not put warnings on their multivitamins because they are not drugs, but they also sent me a coupon for other Bayer products which I do use. I've used One-A-Day Active as well as Bayer Aspirin and Midol with no problems, so I don't think this is a problem with Bayer drugs, just this vitamin."
1,Nausea with vitamin,"I recently purchased the One a Day for Women based on the quality repuation of the product and the added benfits for women; however, I wish I had stayed with the generic store general vitamins. On ALL occasions after taking the vitamin (after eating) I became extrememly nauseous! Luckily, the feeling passed within a couple of hours. Needless to say, I stopped taking them. After going online to see if anyone was having similar problems, I found many reviewers on this site with the same complaint about the One a Day Weight Loss formula. Could it be something (like a binding agent) used in all of the brands manufactured by Bayer HealthCare? So, if you have a sensitive stomach, I would recommend staying away from these..."
3,I really like the features of One-A-Day for ...,I really like the features of One-A-Day for women. It has more iron and folic acid than others and many of the vitamins we're missing in our diets that are important to women our age.
3,"Not bad, but it has its problems","I've recently started taking a multi-vitamin at the suggestion of my doctor (keep in mind I'm 19). One-A-Day probably isn't all that bad of a vitamin, but I have to say that the size of the pill seems overly large, making it difficult to swallow. Also, it leaves an aftertaste in my mouth that lingers most of the day."
1,Made me nauseous,"I took this vitamin with and without food for over a month and still got very nauseous after each time. One time, I even felt so sick, I threw up. I was excited about the extra calcium in the vitamin and bought the 200 tablet bottle...now, I am sorry I did. I plan on contacting the company to see what they can do, since they are so expensive! Buyers beware!"
3,Healthy but chalk-like,"Shipping took a little longer than expected for these MVI to arrive. The tablets themselves are exactly what I was looking for in terms of vitamins and minerals, however the size and consistency of the tablet are a deterrent to me having them. I really want to be compliant with my vitamins however I'm not sure I'll be able to. I should have gone with a smaller tablet or at least one that isn't chalk-like. I'm not chewing these; they just taste terrible while swallowing them."
4,don't give up,"I've been taking the women's one a day active metabolism for a couple of years now. I understand people's frustration with becoming nauseas. The vitamins may not come with a warning but they do come with instructions: ""take with food."" They mean it. What I've come to ""appreciate"" is that when they say ""food"" they really mean a full stomach. I suppose my breakfasts aren't very large so I take them with lunch and I find that makes a world of difference! Back when I was still set on taking them at breakfast it took me several nauseas mornings to determine that I couldn't take before I ate my bowl of oatmeal and I couldn't take it halfway through my bowl, but I had to take it right after the last bite...and maybe have a doughnut hole for insurance.Moral of the story: It's a decent vitamin and must be taken it on a full stomach."
1,Sickness from a Vitamin?!,"When my girlfriend started saying these were making her sick it was hard for me to believe a vitamin could do that, but after reading the reviews here it seems pretty obvious. Time to change the formula One-A-Day!!!"
2,made me sick,"this vitiman is good for you with all the stuff thats in it, but make sure you eat first... It made me feel really sick for an hour or so, I thought I was going to throw up..."
2,Worked great until today,"I started taking One a Day when I got to college, out of fear that I would lose precious nutrients from the awful campus food.When I first started taking them, I felt more awake and vigorous. I was feeling better and had a lot more energy.However, I'm on my period now and I was afraid of iron deficiency. So I took one along with some ibuprofen in the morning before I went to breakfast.I'm having headaches, I'm dizzy, I've got bad nausea and I just want to go home and sleep. Perhaps it was my own fault for not taking it on a full stomach, but this is bad. I mean, I haven't felt this awful in a long time. Really awful idea to take this on my week of midterms, now I might just miss them.Go ahead and buy it, after all, if you don't eat as healthy as you want to, they're great. But DO NOT TAKE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!"
3,Leaves You Wanting More,"Lovely book on a magical subject, but it's just not long enough. Really left me thinking: ""Is that all there is?"" But since there's really not much out there on the subject of Storybook Architecture, this book will have to do."
2,disappointed,"There were some pretty pictures in this book, but overall I was disappointed. Especially since there was no jacket cover on the book...that would have been the prettiest part."
2,All in California?,I was disappointed. The houses were mostly all in California. There is actually a house in Brooklyn New York that is a landmark and is better than most houses featured in this book.
3,It's not good and it's not bad,Bomberman strikes again..... well this game I think is boring. At first when you play it you think its good but after 3 levels it REALLY gets boring. Trying to beat 1 level is hard enough because you can die by your bombs!! And also getting busted by those animals and getting killed by your owm bombs can be really frustrating. I wouldn't recomend this to anyone except those who really like bomberman. The graphics are stunting but the gameplay is really boring. So don't buy it except if you like bomberman!! BORING GAME!!
4,The Eternal Evil of Asia,"This movie is interesting. It's not as serious themed as other asian movies like black magic but it does deal with black magic. It's more of a dark comedy and erotic themed movie, than a serious movie about black magic. Overall not a bad movie."
3,Silly movie,"I have to admit I don't really understand the appeal of HK cinema. There have only been a couple I have really enjoyed, and this isn't one of them. This movie doesn't know if it wants to be a sophmoric comedy, a horror show, or some soft-core erotic flick. To some people this jumble might be an exciting show, to me it is a boring mess. It is decidely different from anything you'd get from Hollywood, so that must be at least part of the appeal."
5,Everything must have form.,"Learn how your actions, your words, even your thoughts form your soul. Learn how to give ""form"" to your happiness, even to your sorrows. Know who you really are, and work from there. Become aware of the importance of a good ""plan"" as you build your life. See how the Spirit works in all form."
4,5 Stars on the CUTE rating,"To be sure, ""Girls Unbutton"" would not be considered an Academy award contender. However, the film is very cute, somewhat a more mature, Asian version of ""Sixteen Candles"". It is also a feel-good movie. Lots of nudity, but with lots of humor. Barring its excessive usage of nudity, it would be a good family movie. Too bad I won't be able to share the movie with my little cousins. END"
3,"Stupid, in cute way","This movie is a strange combination of slapstick comedy and soft porn. There are many ""stupid"" scenes, combined with nudity and simulated sex. The first few minutes are good example of this. The leading lady's boyfriend is continually accidentially abused, and then they have sex. However, putting aside its flaws (I am not a fan of sex scenes), it is generally a fun, mindless movie. For those interested, it does come with English subtitles."
3,a little nastiness,"This was given an extra star only because it was what it was advertised as, a light-weight bit of nudity,sex and a sophomoric storyline that appeals to the,well, bored boring. Rest assured, it is a movie about naked women getting naked and laid but does not raise to the level of hardcore porn. There is a plot, I think, but it is an insult to even the average moviegoing horndog to suggest it is anything profound. I got a nasty movie to look at cute naked women and that's what I got. A working fast-forward is a must while watching this and there is no need for subtitles; if you don't know what you are seeing...well, the cheesy dialoge won't help you."
3,It's ok,"I'm a simple girl when it comes to food. I like what I call ""regular food."" To me, this means typical food that most people, regardless of demography or geography, would be familiar with. I am also from a relatively small town, so I don't have specialty markets close by to shop for groceries. We have a Wal-Mart and a couple of regular grocery stores, so if most of the recipes call for scallions, shallots, phyllo shells, sun dried tomatoes, pickling spice, turbinado sugar, and so on, it isn't feasible for me. I'm not driving 50+ miles to pick up a jar of pitted kalamata olives.If you live in a big city and you have a ""refined pallet"" with access to specialty stores and a Whole Foods, you might like this cookbook. If you are a regular person that wants a meal your whole family will eat, it isn't in this book. I have used and liked maybe 5-10 recipes in the entire book. Everyone is different in their tastes, and this was didn't really suit mine."
1,not very helpful,This book gives a bare amount of info most of which could have found out by using the phone. The information given is very vague and the book needs more info to be helpful.
3,Careful with date school was established,I was browsing at the local bookstore for future graduate schools when I came across this: The book listed University of Florida as established in 1953 and Florida State University as 1857. The dates are reversed. University of Florida was establisehd in 1857. I know this because I graduated from the University of Florida. Overall the book gives a decent overall view of what programs and degrees the grad schools offer. A bit more info on graduate tuition fees for in state and out of state would be helpful.
3,Sorry to disappoint but...,"As I sit in Strozier Library, in the center of the Florida State University campus, I can tell you that FSU was established in 1857."
4,"Cute variety of ideas, but no need to buy the book","There are a cute variety of ideas, but really, you don't need to buy the book, since all of the ideas are hosted on Better Homes & Gardens website, [...] . There are pumpkin ideas (lots of different creative ones, including the ultra-cute Cinderelly's Carriage), party/serving decorations, food, costumes, and other crafts. Great pictures, easy instructions, but again, you can find everything on their website, so buying the book is a bit superfluous."
5,Blue's Clues -jobs,My Grand Daughter is 2 years old and she loves Blue's Clues. This is a great video for kids about jobs that big people do including being a doctor and visiting the doctor.
3,good as i expected,"my son loves blue. this is great. even after having watched this a hundred times, years later, the dvd still works."
4,Blue's Clues- Blue's Jobs,I have an autistic grandchild and he loves Blue's clues. He can recite many of the episodes verbatim. He can mimic the voices and inflection. It is a delight to see him. Thank you! I wonder if Disney would be willing to progress for children with special needs. It would certainly challenge Dilan to greater progress.
2,Latinoamerica / Franck Pourcel,"The CD quality was very nice. But have one track was not different title. The track is ""Copacabana""!"
3,Beautiful music albeit dated!,"I initially heard this album about 29 years ago and I had even managed to buy the LP version of it. With the passage of time, that album developed clicks , pops and worse, one number (the title song, no less!) had become un-playable. The CD was a blessing in disguise.As far as the music is concerned, well it is music of the 80s, but so what? Most of the numbers are a delight to hear. May not appeal to all especially today's generation!BRDehra Dun"
2,hhmmm go for bonnie tyler i say,i must say kim has a good voice but to be honest the only songs i like are crazy in the night and dont fall in love with a dreamer. rest of music is very dated
4,"Delicious, simple recipes","I have owned this book for just under ten days, and I just completed my fifth dinner from its pages. Not one has been less than excellent, and all have been amazingly easy to prepare. I have a shelf full of cookbooks, but for everyday dinners, this is one I'll turn to most."
5,Updated by new edition,"As director and editor in chief of Catholic News Service, I can report that CNS has published an expanded and updated version of the Stylebook on Religion. The book includes not only authentic information about Catholic terms and institutions, but also accurate and useful facts about other religions. The book's expertise comes from our 80-year tradition of reporting on religion."
1,Terrible book,"Where do I begin? There is nothing intrinsically Irish about this book for the most part. They have taken a bunch of old, stale, unfunny jokes and stories and inserted Irish names for the characters.What a disappointment."
4,Wonderful looking pedals,"Pros - These pedals are very nice looking. They provide excellent grip. The pedals are a bit over sized, making them stand out. That's not a problem except the fact that if your brake and gas pedal are close together with smaller ""stock pedals"" these new pedals make your brake and gas pedal even closer.Cons - The buzzing sound from the transformer & the output from the glow. Its not a pure white and has an almost greenish whitish look. Also the wire to the gas pedal shorts out quickly due to the constant pressing of the gas pedal.The only reason I bought these color pedals was because I could not find them in blue any where. And the few sellers I was able to find that had them in blue, had a lame stock picture that doesn't represent the actual item. I finally found a seller in NY that was willing to take, and send me a picture of the blue ones and I bought them. Even the blue ones didn't look completely blue. More like an aqua blue."
5,"Great Story, Great Series","My son has recently began wanting more complicated books when we are reading and I found these while searching on Amazon. I purchased them and am very pleased.The story line is simple but follows a natural, building progression that some of the other ""early readers"" lack. The short simple chapters have allowed me to introduce a more advanced format to my son and I feel has really enabled him to progress to more complicated story concepts.I am looking forward to picking up the rest of the series and would definately recommend it to others."
5,mr. putter,I loved these books about Mr. Putter and is cat. They were the books i learned to read from. I always asked for the new ones that came out and read them all the time.
1,Formatting of kindle edition is terrible. Don't waste your money.,"We are huge Mr. Putter and Taby fans in our house. But, the formatting on the Mr. Putter and Taby kindle books are awful. Pages are duplicated, and pictures are chopped off. Pictures do not join together correctly the way they should. The publisher should be ashamed of itself. Honestly, my preschooler could have done a better job of the formatting."
5,Awesome,A real fun CD. Full of original arrangements of much loved classics. They really are a world class chorus!
1,counterfeit,This product isn't made by Polo.It doesn't even have the Polo label on the outside and doesn't resemble the dozen odd pairs of Tyler shorts I already own.Buyer Beware!
5,"Yes, you should step back from that ledge, my friend!","This recording (which is also available under the title Conscious Relationships) can be hard to find, but is definitely worth the effort. I just wish I had heard it before I used that flamethrower on my late boyfriend... I read constantly, and on almost any topic, one result being a very low opinion of self-help books and even distant relations to the genre. This guy's recorded workshops are in a class by themselves, and his blend of eastern and western disciplines takes the whiney myopia out of psychotherapy and the self-righteousness out of religion. Maybe I'll wait a few more days before putting my head in the oven. He really is that good.PS - I very much like his laugh."
4,Life in the West,"Burro Bill and Me, a personal memoir, shows the West in the 1930s just as it was changing from an open territory to the settled land it is now. This very literate, funny, and insightful book is a joy to read. Ms Price gave up a life as a nurse to a millionaire to travel Death Valley, Nevada, and the Arizona Strip behind a burro. The characters she meets come to life in this book; from the old prospectors, Mormon farmers, thieves, and people who would give their last bite of food to a couple of strangers. While the book is difficult to find, it's worth whatever you pay for it."
2,Won't lay flat,Item is pretty flimsy. Not what I expected. I am using it and will keep it but I would not recommend it to anyone. It absolutely will not lay flat. Each table I bought is angled different. I am going to have to bend the metal to get it right.
5,The best Brushes,"I own shelties, and they have a double coat which require some grooming. These are the best brushes that you will fine anywhere on the market. They have rounded tips and are also easier on the skin and the dogs seem to even enjoy being brushed."
5,Short and quick!,"Easy quick read, but it gets down to the point. I would like for everyone to read it, and get saved."
3,He went to hell and then what?,I was expecting him to focus more on his thoughts after he went to hell but rather he just focuses on what he saw and what it was like which is valid but just not what I was looking for. I feel like if you gave this to a non believer it would sort of scare the person into the faith which is not an approach I recommend. It was an interesting read overall.
1,Dissatisfied,"I oredered the Oster 4281 and found it bulky. The cover to the coffee pot is impossible to remove for cleaning and there a piece of the lid that is almost broken from trying to remove it. If I choose to use coffee filters the filter folds over when it brews, so I just use the wire basket it came with. I am very unhappy with this product and the worse thing about it is I cannot return it for a refund to [...]."
2,Coffee to week.,"I purchased the new Oster coffee maker about two weeks ago.Nice design but I am not impressed with the taste of the coffee. I keep increasing the amount of grinds and I end up with the same results.Weak tasting coffee.Yes I did hit the brew darker button.I also dont like all the water that remains on the back side of the lid.Im always wipping it down. And if youve got big hands, good luck cleaning the pot out. They could of atleast made the lid removable. My $20 braun made a better pot of coffee but they have discountinued that old model. Now I am back to researching again.I will end up putting this one in a cabinet- just for a back-up.Kurt in CT."
1,12 cup coffeemaker,We ordered this coffe maker and it arrived broken. The digital display area did not work. We sent it back and are still waiting for a hot cup of coffee.
1,Don't do it!,"I purchased 2 of these for my newly remodeled kitchen..they look great,but after 1 month both are useless.The 1st one never worked right from the beginning.Sometimes it would program,most of the time it wouldn't.Then it just quit.The 2nd worked great for a month,then started in with the same problems.The chance of purchasing two 'lemons' is quite slim.The only reason I even gave 1 star was because of the great customer service from Oster.They're replacing both with a comparable Mr.Coffee with no problems whatsoever.They look really nice..maybe after they fix all the programming 'bugs' they'll be worth the money."
2,Occasional problem,"This product has a built in defect which occurs about one out of every 15-20 times it is used. The nozzle that sprays the hot water over the coffee, at times will spray behind the paper filter, causing the filter to bend over the coffee with the water going behind the filter. This results in less water going through the coffee resulting in a very weak product. At first, I thought I had made a mistake with the paper filter. Even being careful, this happens about 3-4 times a month. I had the unit over 30 days before I realized it wasn't my fault. Too late to return it."
2,Five Months of OKAY Coffee,"I purchased this coffee-maker in late November 2007 and after about a week or so of adjusting the grind, toying with the 'strength' and 'warmth' settings, and otherwise experimenting, I was finally able to brew what I considered an acceptable cup of coffee out of it. That lasted until the end of April 2008, when as I was filling the reservoir, the seals busted on the thing and I ended up with the equivalent of a full carafe of water spread across my kitchen counter and the floor. It was okay while it lasted, but considering the price, 5 months is not nearly a long enough product-life for me to give this coffee-maker a good review. Shoddy, and only decent coffee after much toying with the settings and amounts."
3,Replacement decanter problem /costly,"Yes, I also really like this coffeemaker which is why I paid $99.00 in May of 07 at Kohls. However, trying to get a replacement decanter when I dropped the original one has been trying. Finally, after buying/trying 3 different ones, going to Kohls again, and trying to contact Oster including a call where I waited almost an hour and was subsequently hung up on, I managed to get a decanter on order for $24.07. So be aware that if you break the decanter, it will cost you!"
4,"Nice, but I have nothing to compare it to","It makes good coffee when the blend is a flavor I like. My only complaint about this coffee maker is that the coffee jug (or whatever you call it) is hard to clean. It has a lip on the inside of the rim, which forces you to rinse it out and dump the water a few times before you get all of the soap out of it. I suppose if I would have bought more expensive maker, that wouldn't be a problem.This is my first coffee maker though."
1,One year and in the garbage!,"I purchased this coffee maker because my sister had one and I liked it. Well, when I got mine after a short time the pot leaked when pouring. The coffee was never really hot but that was OK. Then one day a year after it was purchased it didn't brew anymore because the water wasn't getting hot, I guess the thermostat went out. My sister also had to replace the lid for the pot because one of the little prongs broke off. Beware, it may look good but..."
5,Good enough,"A good guide to Britain's coastal defenses of WWII. Good enough for those interested in the Battle of Britain or the Blitz, or for that mater anyone interested in what might be possible for Operation Sealion."
5,Where's season 4!?,"Argh!! Best Xmen Series EVER! Where's the season 4 DVD?!Or, better yet, where's season 5?!A web comic?Something?[...]"
4,Great show that deserved a better DVD release,"Loved the series end to end, never doubt that, but the S3 box set has technical issues. Lots and lots of ""ghosting"" and ""strobing"" when both background and characters are in motion (pan shots and such)."
5,Please release season 4 of X-Men Evolution,"Great show, love the re-boot of the series. However, its a shame the studios left us hanging and didn't release the 4th season.While this show is more kid friendly/oriented than the previous X-Men animated series, it is still good to see your favorite mutants on television!"
3,only if there were more full season box sets,its a great show but why only make/sell only the 3rd season even if im so sure what happens in the beginning but im mostly mad at the fact there is no 4 season so i dunno if you wanna see a xmen movie that dont end and just want to boost marvel sales then get it......you jerks
4,X-men Evolution season 3,"Much grittier, more serialized writing than Season 1 & 2.See the origin of Apocalypse, as well as more involvement from Magneto.Needed better instrumental music though, apart from the great bgn and end theme."
5,Top of the world!,"Honestly, 5 is not the rating for X-M:E season 3, its more than that!Season 3 is recommended by most fans, even Boyd Kirkland's fav season is 3.X-M:E season 3 managed to handle season 3 in the best way it could with a mixture of both drama and action not all drama like season 2.So all the best!"
3,Why can't they release this series normally?,"I'm getting really frustrated with collecting this series.I just happen to be in the store and see,X-men COMPLETE third season in one set.I thought,oh man,I didn't even realize that seasons one and two were re-released again like this on one set (instead of four seperate discs/boxes released indiviudualy.Well,it turns out that they haven't re-released season one and two.So now I've got a total of nine boxes.4 for season one(with only four episodes on each disc),4 for season two (same amount of episodes per disc) and now this one.Please,please,PLEASE! Remake seasons 1 and two in the same styleas this third season.NOBODY likes those cheap cardboard,strange-closing boxes that the first eight discs were put in.Plus it takes up too much room on your dvd shelf!Give X-men Evolution the same respect as Batman Beyond,Teen Titans,and Justice Leauge.They all got a makeover;this show is awesome and deserves one too!!"
5,Sabicas - the eternal master of the Flamenco guitar,"There is none and has never been one like Sabicas, and this CD brings all of the drama and beauty of his guitar to you in a way no other can approach. When you hear his tremolo, his Soleares and Farrucas, you will imagine that he has twenty fingers instead of ten. This collection is by far the best I have ever heard in the years I have been listening to Sabicas, and unsuccessfully trying to emulate his skill. VIVA SABICAS in our memories and hearts. This disk will do just that!"
4,Recommended viewing,"This flick had well above average production values for the 1950's. The actual sets were spectacular(for this timeframe) and it had great use of stock footage. Sure, the dinosaurs were cheesy, but name one 50's monster that wasn't. I purchased this before seeing it and am glad to say that it will remain in my library. Most films I purchase before seeing end up on Ebay. Check it out!!"
3,Good Movie,"It's a good movie. They go to the south pole. But there is awarm spot there due to hot springs or something. Anyway thearea is prehistoric with dinosaurs. There is also a man livingthere who was left stranded there from an expedition years before.Never mind that the dinosaurs look so fake. The seriousness ofthe acting makes you hardly even notice. It's interesting, withaction and good dialog. It may be in black and white. But it's good."
1,Alternate ending for this movie,"The people are making their way to the recently repared copter, when Skakespere shows up, grabs the lady, beats her up, and feeds her to the carnivorous plant, followed by the caveman guy, and all the rest except the pilot, who escapes missing an arm."
1,Leave It Alone,"I love this opera and own it in many incarnations: the wonderful French version with tenor Leopold Simeneau; Italian with mezzos Podles, Larrmore, Horne and baritone Fischer-Dieskau. All of them offer something special. This performance, however, is a resounding dud. The sound isn't bad by live performance (l971) standards, but Ozawa offers the slowest, dullest conducting I have ever heard. Since the accompanying leaflet offers absolutely no information beyond a plot summary, it's impossible to tell which of the several alternate versions of the opera this is, but in any case much familiar music is deleted, and the singers offer no embellishments to balance the funereal pace. The soloists have their moments, but Verrett is much better experienced on her commercial recording with Fasano and the Virtuosi de Roma (?). I purchased this recording for the unusual pairing of Verrett and the wonderful Stella, but they, as well as the listener, are fighting a losing battle."
3,Worth it for Verrett,"It is true, as mentioned above, that Seiji Ozawa seems a bit out of his element in this baroque masterpiece. He almost seems to be sight-reading the score. Fortunately, he has two wonderful artists playing the protagonists. Shirley Verrett was at her artistic peak and brings drama and pathos to the role of Orfeo as only she can. Although Euridice is normally cast with a lyric soprano, Antonietta Stella's dramatic voice helps bring the small part to life. Mariella Adani's voice had apparently darkened by this point in her career (or is the recording pitched lower?) and she brings little verve to Amore.This opera has received more interesting interpretations in recent years both in the theater and on record but Verrett fans will not want to miss her in a role she rarely performed onstage."
1,Very Overpriced,I just received the 2 airplanes I ordered for grandkids - they are so small & flimsy that I know I wasted the $8.00 & not worth it to return them. Think twice before ordering!!Hanger 9 Logo Balsa Wood Glider
5,GRIPPING READ,I feel like I knew Indigo personally after reading this book.The only thing I could ask for is more of her story. What happened to her over the years?
2,Average Performance,"These knifes sound great on paper, good balance, Hi carbon blade, comfortable handle. However, I did not like the combination serrated/striaght blade. Meat cuts cleanly thru the straight section of the blade then gets caught up in the serrations. Tried on chicken, beef, pork, and fish, kept tearing up the meat, no good for me. Great for cutting open frozen vegatable boxes, but that's not why I purchased them. Not recomemded."
1,Bitterly Disappointed,"These knives are terrible! The serrations on the knife blade are so small they don't cut the meat; they tear the meat. Then when you set the knife back on the plate you have a steak knife with shreds of meat embedded in the serrations on the knife. Want to cut a piece of ham 1/4"" thick? It's impossible. The meat can only be torn apart between your fork and the knive, as the serrations only tear and do not cut. I'm currently looking for some real steak knives and will donate these to charity or throw them away."
2,Best for intermediate typists and above,"This product is confusing for beginners as it doesn't adequately teach where to place fingers. It shows colored keys matched to colored fingers, however, children (or adults) need to look in two different places to match colors...not an easy feat! Our family members who are already atleast intermediate typists found it fun to play as a way to work on speed and accuracy."
1,Poorly formatted for instruction,I was greatly disappointed that a title associated with quality games was so poorly programmed and formatted as an instruction tool. Action is confusing and does not match illustrations or inside manual. Of littly use in teaching 8 to 12 year old beginners!
5,Inexpensive,These items can cost $60-80 at the dealership plus even more for installing. Take the item to your local mechanic if you are not handy; cost about $60 to install.
4,Some flaws but beautiful,"Having been a lover of opera for over 70 years it was always surprising to me that I had never heard La fanciulla del West. This recording made in the early 60s with one of my favorite singers, Renata Tebaldi is wonderful. She does have a few lapses on reaching some of her high notes but overall I found the recording outstanding. This Puccini opera is just beautiful music throughout. There are no arias as such. I enjoyed it very much. I imagine if this were to be recorded today all the blemishes would have been removed. One thing I noticed. There is a theme running through the opera that seemed very familiar. I finally realized it was used in Phantom of the Opera by Andrew Lloyd Weber."
2,NOT Tebaldi's best MINNIE,"This new release from Opera D'Orio, gives us a RARE chance to hear Renata Tebaldi, supposedly at her peak. It's a live RAI broadcast from 1961, with Barioni as Dick Johnson, Guelfi as Rance, and Tebaldi as Minnie, a role she didn't perform onstage until 1970 at the MET. While this recording has it's moments, it is not Tebaldi's or Barioni's finest hour. I strongly urge you to buy the DECCA/LONDON complete opera with Tebaldi. It is an unforgettable, exciting, sweeping performance. However, you may have to hunt at Amazon/UK or elsewhere for it. This CD set had to be in my collection, as it is the first time it has ever been put on LP or CD, but I will not listen to it much. Basile's conducting is choppy, never giving ANY life at all to this recording. There are better Faniculla's out there, with Tebaldi. Unfortunately, you have to hunt for them."
3,My children enjoy this movie.,"I am not a Godzilla fan. My children, especially my 9-year-old son, are both big fans. They have watched these videos several times since receiving the set as a Christmas gift. My 11-year-old nephew has also enjoyed watching the movies. I thought the movies were boring and had horrible graphics but, as noted earlier, I am not a fan. The other adults in our family did not enjoy watching the set either. That is why I am giving them a 3."
3,Megalon and 1985... why?,"The only thing I have to say about putting these 2 films together in a 2 pack is... why? ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" is one of the most goofiest Godzilla films in the whole series and ""Godzilla 1985"" is one of the scariest, most down to earth Godzilla films. You will be really confused if your first Godzilla movies are these 2 in a 2 pack. First you watch ""Godzilla 1985"" and think ""WOW, Godzilla is a force to be reconed with. He's a huge, lumbering, radioactive horror, who kills anithing in sight!"" Then you watch ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"", and now Godzilla is dancing, flying, and doing flying kicks on his tail and co- starring with a happy, dancing robot who can change size when he wants to. What will a person being introduced to this series think of this? ""NEVER AGAIN WILL I WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS JUNK"" is what they will think! Now mabey if they put ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" and ""Godzilla 1985"" in a 2 pack..."
1,Rusted!,"I wish I read these reviews before selecting the set (it was a gift). I've had them for two months and they have rust all over! The product advertises ""no discoloring"" and ""never needs polishing."" What a lie! I just hope that Bed Bath and Beyond takes them back without the packaging and without the receipt. What a waste of a hundred dollars for the rusty service for eight."
1,Poor.,This silverware has a very undesirable 'metallic' taste and gets so stained and rusty it is impossible to clean.Stay Away.
1,Hostess Set,"I would like to know if I can purchase the ""Townhouse"" Satin Hostess Serving Set as I just bought the 12 piece place setting for 12 and it did not come with the Hostess Set. I purchased my sets from the local Bed, Bath and Beyond store in Sarasota,FL.Also, I cannot rate your product at this time as I have not used it yet.Thank You for your help.Karen Ruzck"
5,Yiddish everyone can appreciate.,You don't have to know Celtic to enjoy Enya and you don't have to know Yiddish to be completely entranced by the haunting melodies and text presented by Adrienne Cooper and Zalmen Mlotek. The lyrics are presented in such way that I was transported to the ghettos of Warsaw and Vilna. The spirit and courage of the oppressed Jews whose voices were silenced are given voice in this remarkable CD. Kudos!
5,This book changed my life.,"The stories and examples in this book are incredible. The step by step guide is easy to understand, but hard to apply until you are sick and tired of being sick and tired. Great book if you really want to know how to be secure, this is the book you should buy."
3,Practical basic advice if you can get through the hype...,"The advice is very basic, but there are some people who probably need it, so that's fine. But, I got tired of hearing the words ""Total Money Makeover"" every page, or hearing about how great he is, or the shameless plugs for all the other things he sells. He begins by discussing why he wrote another book, after reading half of it, I think the reason was ""to sell stuff"". Went to the website, and you can't even download pdf versions of his worksheets for free. Moving on the something with more substance, and less hype."
4,Really well put together,"This book was really well put together, and if I hadn't already spent so much time and money reading other books about personal finance, I probably would have come away with a bunch of new insights. If you are someone who finds themselves caught in corporate America and a tight financial situation, than this book is a great place to start on you search for answers, as it is obvious that the author clearly knows what he is talking about and has obviously put a lot of quality effort into this book."
4,Helpful advice for those needing to find a path out of debt,"This book is thoughtfully laid out and there are a great deal of real life examples throughout. Not everyone is gifted or taught how to manage personal finance, so books like The Total Money Makeover are great ways of learning what to do and what to avoid. Creating a plan and tackling problems one by one is great advice!A savvy, very informed financial reader might not be interested in this book; but for those starting out or looking for a way out of the depths of debt, this book is well worth the investment."
3,Good motivational tool....lots of fluff,"First of all, I really do respect Dave Ramsey and the work that he does. I agree 100% with his ""no debt"" philosophy.But...this book was kind of a letdown. Want to save $20? Here's a summary of the book:1. Debt sucks. Don't get into it. Buy with cash.2. Here's how to payoff debt: Concentrate on the smallest debt first. Pay what you can on it, over the minimum payment. Once the smallest debt is gone, add that former payment to the next outstanding debt payment...and so on...and so on (the ""debt snowball"").3. After all debts are gone, set aside 3-6 months of expenses (emergency fund).4. After the emergency fund, start investing.That's it. Seriously. This book should've been a free/small PDF download from the web..and not a $20 book."
5,"Debt is dumb, cash is king... and Dave is awesome!","I think those who feel the book has a lot of ""fluff"" are just reading the book instead of ""doing"" the book. I'm in the middle of my own debt snowball, and I find many of the stories inspirational because they are from real people who've done what I'm doing. I'm human, and need some encouragement from time to time.Yes, the book is simple. Yes, it can be summarized in about four bullet points. This is not a doctrate-level course in personal finance. But, as Dave says, personal finance is only 20% knowledge and 80% behavior. This book will give you the 20% knowledge; it's up to you to live right. Now go do it and change your family tree forever!"
3,Great Book - For Those Who Need Savings Advice,"My husband and I both read this book, and we both thought that it was very good and had great financial advice. This book focused on advice centered around HOW to save money - not necessarily how to invest or build a nest egg once you've already got the ""savings"" thing down.My husband and I are both very good savers - We have built both substantial emergency funds and retirement savings - so, this book wasn't necessarily great for us, because we already know HOW to save, which is the direction this book focused on.The information provided in Dave Ramsey's Total Money Makeover is very good information for anyone who needs advice on how to start saving for their future, however, if you already have a good sense of savings, this book might not be of substantial value."
5,How to release yourself from bondage,Credit card companies and banks hate this guy. Plain lauguage and seems too simple to be true - but it is - and it works 100%.
1,The Total Money Makeover: A Proven Plan for the Financial Fitness,I am not sure if it was just the digital copy of the book but the content seem disconnected and points were often repeated. Felt like I skimmed through a lot of it hoping it would go into the action items which the book promised.
3,Okay,Well this was an adventure into a different way to live; but......it did not answer all of my questions about how to get there.
2,Dave is well meaning but has very little training in finance.,"Provides very good advice for reducing debt and for people that have credit problems. Dave has no background or training in investments or insurance and so people should ignore his advice in these areas. As others have mentioned, expecting 12% return from mutual funds over the long run is way off! He also has no real understanding about life insurance. So, stick to his sections on debt matters and the book has some value."
1,what is the big deal,"Don't worry about debt. If you get in over your head, simply walk away or if things get too hard, declare bankruptcy. Dave did. It's the fastest way to become debt free and attain a super low credit score, something Dave loves to say he has, a credit score so low it can't be measured. What's more after several months your mailbox will be deluged with credit offers and if you are so weak and pathetic you can become riddled with debt again, only this time bankruptcy won't be an out. Wake up America. This is the basic common sense our grandparents lived by and taught anyone willling to learn. To pay money, attend seminars or listen to the same old tired tale of woe day after day on the radio is simply beyond belief. Overall sound advice but a whole book to tell one to live within their means, to not buy into the consumer culture, to save for a rainy day? Give me a break!"
1,Too much verbiage for too little concept.,"Very repetitive. It's an easy concept that takes twenty pages or less to describe, and it's stretched over a few hundred. I'll save you some dough - Don't carry debt, and spend less than you make. If you are carrying a lot of debt, Spend even less and pay it off. Make sacrifices to pay it off in order to go cash only.There.Or go to a library and sign it out. Wish I did. Reads like a transcript of his radio show."
1,"Badly Written, Christian Proselytizing","If you want hyperbolic Christian proselytizing and miniscule amounts of information about how to get your finances under control in a badly written book, then go ahead and spend $25 on Total Money Makeover. In my opinion, you're better off going to the library and checking out personal finance books. It won't cost you anything but the gas to get there, and you're more likely to find what you need. Now I gotta figure out how to return it and get my money back."
5,Dave Knows,"Love Dave Ramsey! Nothing fancy just pure financial advise that WORKS. We have been working Dave's plan for about 3 years now and have changed our financial picture by $120,000. Buy the book, read it, do it."
5,simple and to the point,"This book lays out a game plan for financial independence that is so simple it's scary. This is a must read for anyone seeking simple,straight forward steps that build momentum to your financial goals."
5,Simple and Effective,"There isn't a more simple, honest, and straightforward book in the market. Dave really makes sense. Pay off your debts, live below your means, and help others. I found myself skipping many of the success stories, but thoroughly enjoyed the meat and potatoes."
4,Awesome book,This book is definitely encouraging for those who want to live debt free. I love all the tips and tools Dave points out throughout the book.
2,very basic & outdated info,"bought this at the recommendation of a friend, found that it was filled with outdated and old tips and advise."
4,books,I purchased these books for my boss. He would give them out to people that were struggling financially. He highly recommended these books.
4,Smart book,Guided me in ways to handle money for my future and ways to invest it now. It also covers how to use your money so it works for you and not for others.
5,Manditory Reading for Graduating Seniors,"This book is a down to basics approach to money management. It teaches a lifestyle, not quick tips. So if you are not willing to commit 100%, don't waste your money. Buy this for you kids and teach them to live by it."
4,A Novel Idea For Personal Finance in General,"The first part of the book is filled with info everyone knows (or should know) about debt. Pretty boring and unenlightening stuff.The second part is where it actually gets good. That is where Dave actually lays out the plan for eliminating debt. It is slightly different from the ""pay the highest interest stuff first"" plans you always hear about regarding debt and thus slightly novel in its approach. For me, his approach works great because I end up paying the highest interest debt (credit card) first. For others, it may be a problem.But he does provide testimonials throughout which will make anyone (from a high income earner to a person making minimum wage) a believer.This book provides a realistic, practical approach that actually could WORK...if you follow it religiously. At the very least, it made me faaaar more frugal than I have been."
2,Total Money makeover,"I have listened to Dave Ramsey on Fox. I was impressed. I bought his book, thinking and hoping for a challenge of some sort to motivate me into changing my money issues. Very boring book.He could said the same thing in half the pages and saved a few trees. I did pick up one or two things to help me out. The only person getting rich is Dave Ramsey from people like me who buy his books. That is how he stays out of debt."
2,Not so good,"The book arrived in good time and it was professionally wrapped,though the book binding has separated and split down the center; pages 109 through 176 are missing. I will have to contact the book store, they probably did not notice the missing section."
1,Too preachy with some really bad unrealistic advice.,"Listened to a big part of the audiobook where you have to ignore the author/narrator shouting at you. There is some good logical advice but also some Really bad advice. Too many buzzwords and self promotion. Too many bible references. Way too evangelical preachy -almost cult like at times. None of these things belong in a personal finance book. Also clearly written before the economic crisis - assumes really high return and interest rates.Stick with Suze Orman, she gives much better advice. And is far less annoying."
4,Gift worthy,I gave this workbook to my daughter as a gift to help her get her financial house in order. She read it in a week and thanked me for it. I asked her if she wanted me to sell it. She said that she wanted to keep it for a reference.
4,Good intro to personal finance,"I've known about Dave for quite a few years now, listening to his radio show and seeing him on television. If you haven't listened to his radio program very much and aren't very knowledgeable about money, this is a great introduction to how personal finance and credit work. This book is a great reminder of how you can change your life by being debt free and filled with stories of real people who accumulated lots and lots of debt and then got out of it using the debt snowball to keep you motivated.Note on the Kindle edition, you can NOT loan it. This is a real disappointment."
5,Great book,"This book really lays it out. I love it. It's not boring either - my hubby even read it, and he usually only reads fiction. This book should be required reading in high school! If everyone read this book there would be a lot less debt and money trouble."
4,Excellent Financial Advice,"Though I previously had good control over my personal finances, this book was still of incredible use to me. It not only strengthened my resolve on some financial decisions but, also, educated me on some critical ideas and concepts.I suggest this book highly but it is even more useful if you listen to Dave's radio show in addition to reading this book."
4,I would recommend this book,Dave gives his reader a very simple and calculated approach to becoming debt free. He also teaches you how to invest properly.
5,"This is your ""Free Card"" to get out of debt","Dave Ramsey tells it like it is, and exposes the financial myths we've been hearing all our lives. He tells you how to get yourself out of debt and on the road to true wealth.Sure, it's ""just common sense"", but it's not what your banker or credit card company or even your mortgage company is telling you! He makes it clear that you cannot borrow your way out of debt. Then he gives you a step-by-step plan to stop your downward spiral and begin your upward climb to financial success. He won't tell you it's going to be easy.I borrowed the book from the library, then bought my own copy plus one for my daughter. (It's an excellent reference book for when you find yourself weakening!)"
1,Don't buy the Kindle version,"If you must be told to get out of debt and save and invest, get the print version.Mostly it's full of testimonials so, if you need the ""if they can do it so can you"" encouragement, here it is!The publisher obviously thinks that NO effort needs to go into reformatting a print book for Kindle.The entire last 20% is forms which can't be printed from a Kindle.While reading along you'll get ramdom quotes that are from other parts of the book.You've been warned (it's not like they're the only ones that have a Kindle formatting problem so beware)."
5,Helped us,Money was the only thing my wife and I used to fight about. Turned out we just weren't doing it right. Money fights are a thing of the past and we're on our way to financial freedom.
5,the best financial plan out there,"Teach this to your children! This is solid financial advice for the rich, broke, or almost broke. Best money you can invest is this book. Thank you, Dave Ramsey!!!"
4,"A few things I disagreed with, but great advice for most.","Dave Ramsey is right on target throughout the vast majority of this book. He deals with the debt that is overwhelming most Americans and how to get out of it. Once this is under control (with an excellent plan, I might add) he directs you in how to best save for retirement and for your children's college.All of this is done with baby steps so that the reader is not overwhelmed.If you want to build wealth the old fashioned and proven way (get out of debt and save), this is a great book to help. There are a lot of helpful worksheets that provide concrete assistance.It's very readable - I finished it in just over 24 hours even with a good night's sleep and taking my little one to soccer. Total read time is probably only 3-4 hours.Some reviewers have said that you don't need this book if you've read Financial Peace. I haven't read the latter, so I can't comment on that point."
5,Great book - plus a recommendation,"This book, as well as the accompanying workbook, was very helpful, as I am striving to find a beneficial perspective on finances. It was motivating, filled with good advice, and helpful for me as I am looking for steps to take in my financial portfolio. I also found another book, more from a philosophical perspective, very enlightening as well - The Financial Pilgrimage, by Sean K. Mitchell. Together, both have given me just what I need to feel good about God, life, and money."
5,Sound advice!,"It is true, as some of the reviews have said, that this is a very basic book. Dave's advice is less than groundbreaking, but that doesn't take away from its importance.I am a professional debt counselor, and I can't tell you how many people just have the plain wrong ideas about how to get their lives back on track. Dave's advice is simple but invaluable: stop spending what you don't have, and start paying off piece by piece.This book is a pleasure to read, easy, fast, and full of great tidbits on your new financial ""makeover."" Trust me, this book is a winner. I'm recommending it to all my clients--hopefully it won't put me out of a job!"
3,Financial planning,"This book has a lot of good tips and explains step by step process. Parts of it I embraced immediately, but have not completely followed it to the letter."
4,Not revolutionary but some nice little tips and advice,"IF you are a financial expert already then this book probably won't add much value for you, but if you're not it definitely has some good tips and advice that could make a difference."
3,5 chapters explaining how stupid your are to be in debt is too much,You have to get half way through this book before Dave starts telling how to use his method for financial freedom. I think this is because he could explain his system in about 1/4 the space and he had to fill it with something. His snowball method of paying off dept is not the fastest and least expensive but is probably the most motivating. If you are self motivating you should pay more attention to interest rates and pay the highest one first. His cash envelope method of controlling spending and his budget plan are very sound so if you can take the good out of this book I think you might get somewhere.
4,"Great book, worth the $$$$","Book really helps once you are out of student loan debt. Until such a point, it is a premature purchase."
4,Good,Read the book and am following the steps. Must be able to commit to something 100%. Looking forward to getting rid of these student loans
4,Excellent,"This book is so easy to understand and apply to life. I started this ""program"" 3 months ago and I have 2 credit cards left to pay off! The advice is great too."
3,Not a budget book - just a testimonial - useless,Don't buy book to help create a budget. A book telling you how great his techniques are is useless. Just get the workbook.
4,Basic help,I borrowed this book from my sister in law. I read through it and thought this is exactly what is needed in this country. We need some basic steps for getting out of debt and staying there. I received the book and immediately loaned it to a friend in need
5,THE TOTAL MONEY MAKEOVER,"I heard a lot about this book before finally getting to read it. ""Snowball"" principle is widely popular and apparently works for many people, and Dave Ramsey is one of the biggest names in personal finance.The book was what I expected it to be. Dave Ramsey's principles are straight-forward and practical, and there is probably genius in their simplicity. It seemed to be more a motivational book with great encouragement (especially numerous read life success stories) than a how-to guide for people who already have their finances in order and are rather knowledgeable. However, it was good to know what all the talk was about and I walked away with some very useful information. I'd recommend this book. After all, one can't argue with success."
5,Dave Ramsey is AWESOME!,"Dave's book Total Money Makeover has changed our life financially. This man knows what he's talking about and how toexpress it ""layman's"" terms so everyone can understand and implement. He doesn't use complicated financial terms. For my official testimonial/review on this book, go to the link below:[...]"
3,Could Be Half as Long,"Oh my gosh, I had to flip halfway through this book to get to any meat. He spends the first two or three chapters saying, ""No really, this plan works. Keep reading!""Yes, I figure it works, I bought the book.I would like it much better if he had started off with a bang, instead of self-promotion."
3,Good tips but 100% focused in US economy,"I was looking for tips to save money and this books is perfect at that, encouraging and teaching by examples, the only con I see was that most examples were focused in US Economy, somehow I though the tips and advises were not going to be as specific as loan terms in US, credit card interest in US, mortgage terms in US, etc."
2,"This is how Dave Ramsey got rich, millions buying his books!","This book was a real waste of time and money. This book is talking about common sense. The equation is: You got debt so pay it off. If you do not understand this equation than you need to read books in other fields such as Elematary Math made easy. It is a tick book but it got so little info, most of the time it repeats it self. Debt is bad so pay it off. Debt is bad so create a emergency account. Debt is bad, spend wisely. There is also a workbook which does the same thing as QUICKEN. Basicaly the workbook is QUICKEN in paper. In conclusion if you got extra money and time to waste than get this book otherwise stay away..."
2,Not exhaustive or applicable,"I'm facing bankruptcy. This book has lots of scenarios, most very general, and useless to my financial situation. I'm one of the millions working poor buying books to support multi-million dollar authors and this habit has become a financial burden. This is one that will go back to the stores. For those facing hard financial choices highly recommend Surviving Financial Disasters (for the cut throat truth about a way out), The Autmatic Millions (for hope) and The richest man in Babylon (for a good read)."
5,One of the Best Money Management Books I've Read!,"For those who have lost hope in ever controlling the credit card monster, this is the book for you. Dave Ramsey gives a ""baby-step"" formula for getting out of debt, having a budget that you can live with (including ""blow money""), having an emergency savings, and plans for making wealth. I am buying a copy for each of my kids for Christmas. I wished I had read this book as a young adult--it would have made a big difference in my life. Most of all, it has given me hope."
5,Becoming financially savvy,"I read the book and have already put the debt snowball into motion and can already see more of my money available to save and invest. The only problem I had with this book is that there are too many testimonials, but besides that one thing the book is great!!!!"
5,Love This Book,"I got this book on the recommendation of a blogger who raved about Dave's book - and she was right. I liked that he started with a budget - know where your money HAS to go and stick to it. It was an easy read, the steps made sense and I could follow them. Basically he really, really helped me. I loved the book and am already working on reducing my debt. His story and the stories of real people in worse shape than me convinced me I could do it and i am! Highly recommend it! It's changing our life!"
5,Common sense that's not so common anymore,"A lot of the information in this book kind of makes the reader say ""well, duh!"" But if it was really ""well, duh!"" then America wouldn't be drowning in debt. Everything Dave says is (what was once) common sense, but the way he lays it all out makes it so much easier to envision as realistic for even those individuals who feel like they just couldn't get out of debt and could never have a comfortable retirement.I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. If you follow the baby steps, it WORKS. There's nothing magical or special about it, it's just putting all the ""well, duh!"" moments in order, and helping you make sense of your finances one tiny piece at a time.As Mark Twain said, ""The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one."""
4,Great... if you really need it,"This book would be fantastic for people who are really in debt and need a way to dig themselves out. While it contains a lot of good information, and is an easy, interesting read, if you're basically doing okay financially and just looking to do better, you won't learn much new."
3,The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey,Reading this book was like sitting down and talking to Dave. His simple steps to follow in making the money makeover was doable for me. After reading this book it was like a light bulb going on and I'm purchasing copies for my grown children to read. Best self help book I've bought.
5,"Stunning, inspiring!",A marvelous combination: strategies for building wealth and using it to make your life and the world a better place. Now if I can just convince my husband . . .
5,My opinion on The Total Money Makeover,"My sister suggested I read this book; I thought is was great! I learned a few things and putting that to work.I too have suggested this book to friends and family members. It's always a ""good thing"" to learn something new."
3,Good advice,"This boom gives good advice. I am still reading though since it takes you in steps. My only problem is that the author fluffs the book with too many testimonials. I already bought the book so I really didn't need to be sold on it anymore. The funny thing is that none of the examples given matched my situation. If you have been struggling with finances though, then this book can help point you in the right direction."
4,Family Money Management,"Excellent plan/process for family money management. If followed, it works. Most readers will think their circumstances are ""exceptional and not relevant."" Ramsey illustrates ""exceptions"" are rare."
4,Inspirational and helpful,"If you are in financial debt, and need a boost digging out of the hole, then The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey is an excellent starting point. As Ramsey points out though the choice to start down the path to being debt free is up to you. He provides the plan and you provide the initiative.His delivery is that of a stern coach, much like his radio show, which I found slightly off-putting. Only slightly though because his advice is much-needed. Dave Ramsey has helped countless people and inspired many more. I hope this book finds its way to others who need it still."
5,Could Not Put It Down.,"He makes it so simple. Now, I'm just starting out on baby step 2, and I know its going to be a lot of hard work. All I have to do is keep the guy in the mirror in check. You read this book and it all makes perfect sense, It sort of leaves thinking ""wow, why was I not taught these principles as a younger man"". They're is no gimmick or secret password or pyramid here folks. Just be ready to put in some hard work and to focus on your goals - emphasis on FOCUS... And the steps are there so that you focus on each step one at a time. Thank you Dave and God bless you."
3,Great Concept,"Dave Ramsey has a great concept here, but the stuff in the book is really nothing new. If you have ever listened to Dave's talk show or read any of his other books, this just reiterates the same thing... Don't go into debt. If you haven't had many dealings with Dave then this book would be a good read. It's easy to follow and there are lots of ""success stories"". One very good point that was made in the book is that all people have to be onboard when going through the plan."
4,good read,"I felt like most of the book left you waiting in suspense of the actual ""show me how"" parts of it. It kept repeating ""money makeover"" and most the actual how to, was left for the end. it was a good read and informative and I really enjoyed reading the examples of others that had made drastic changes in their finances."
3,Very basic budgeting book,"It's a fine first budgeting book but you can get the info elsewhere for free. This book has very basic advice that I think most people have already heard. If you have ever read any other finance/budget books, visited [...], listened to your parents or read the reviews of this book, you already know this stuff and can save yourself $10.The book is very repetitious. There are personal stories but I couldn't relate to any of them. Ramsey quotes the bible a lot which I know some people really like. There are budget forms which won't help you on a kindle plus you can download budget software for free from various places. Ramsey debunks money myths such as ""Playing the lotto and other forms of gambling will make you rich"" which I don't think most people need a book to tell them that's not the case.This book wasn't for me but I think it would be a fine book for my stepson so I gave it a three."
2,This is not an investing book!!!,"This is a get out of debt book. The investing tips are: ""Buy mutual funds that earn over 12%"". Where might I find such an animal? Not gonna happen. If you are in debt, buy this book. If you want investing tips, please move along."
3,Good,"this is a good book that shows u small but effective steps to get out of debt but also includes a lot of fluff( motivational fluff)save urself the money and buy The Richest Man in Babylon, its cheaper and timeless + u get about the same information"
5,"Changed, our, and our families lives","If you allow this book, to change your paradigm, you will become a wealthy person. My wife & I, have good incomes, so good, by fours years out of school, we had $125,000 of NON Mortgage, debt. I had heard Dave some on the radio, so when I saw the book, I told my wife, jokingly, that this book was going to make us a lot of money. By early next year, after a lot of sacrifice, determination and following the principles in the book, we'll be debt free, we'll never borrow money again. We will literally begin to change our entire family tree, all thanks to a $20 hardback..."
5,Great book--it helped us pay off thousands in debt!,This book gave us the tools we needed to pay off our debt. It motivated us and gave us step-by-step instructions. We are now credit-card debt free! Dave Ramsey changed our life!
5,The Best Book I Have Ever Read,"This book is wonderful. I recommend it to anyone who is in the middle of a financial disaster or to anyone who wants to know a sure way to prepare for their future. Just like Dave Ramsey says it will teach you ""To live like no one else so you can live like no one else."" Thank you so much Dave for all of your knowledge and your willingness to share all of the information in your book with people like me that just didn't have a clue."
3,It's ok,His ideas are good but to me they don't seem that realistic. He expects you to save $1000 cash in a short time. If you are already hard pressed for money where does he expect this extra $1000 to come from??
4,Good Read,"This book provides a great starting point and clear steps to begin getting your financial house in order. We have begun implementing the first steps of budgeting and starting an emergency fund, and look forward to continuing moving forward."
5,Amazing and Inspiring!,"I stumbled on Dave Ramsey when my pastor asked me to coordinate Financial Peace University at my church. I immediately Googled the program and spent hours on the website. I then downloaded the book and began reading furiously, followed by enacting the principles and baby steps in my own life in the same day. I haven't even begun teaching FPU at church yet but my husband and I are already attacking Baby Step 2 and seeing incredible results both financially and personally. Thanks Dave!"
5,BEST BOOK YOU CAN BUY TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE!,"The Total Money Makeover has not only changed my entire life, but it has changed the lives of all of my friends and family. After we purchased the book, we bought it for loved ones because of the affect it had on us. It's a great prelude to the course ""Financial Peace University"", which is free (you just have to purchase the class materials for $99 and can share them with someone). Dave is a nonsense straight forward guy. The book is written at a 6th grade reading level with big font. It's easy to understand and implement - but you have to make a choice to implement what you read. Remember it can take anywhere from 30-90 days to make something a habit. You will feel convicted and it will be a good thing. Change your life, change your future and start right now. There's a reason why he has a radio show, t.v. show, podcast and is on the New York Times best sellers list! Read it!!!! IT IS AMAZING! BY FAR THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ."
5,Simple (but not easy) approach that works!,This plan works!....very easy to read and understand. The success stories throughout the book are very encouraging to read. A great buy!
4,Great for Starters...,"and people in debt. Dave does a great job making finances simple. As a Financial Manager, I feel the basic principles in this book are wonderful starters. Dave's recommendations are simple easy steps for beginning budgeting and debt relief. Although this book is designed mostly for people in debt, some basic principles apply to us all."
4,"Good, sound financial information","This is good financial managment information for many families who are struggling with debt, learning how to stay out of debt, and (like ourselves)learning the next steps toward financial freedom. I encourage others to read this book."
5,Great book!,"This book will change your ideas about money. Do yourself a favor and get this book! Even if you don't use all of Dave's recommendations, you will definitely benefit from using even part of them."
3,Don't need both book and workbook,I'm not sure this is really worth the money. You can get an idea of what Dave Ramsey's views are if you just read about him.
2,THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL?????,"This book is good for making one person a millionaire: Dave Ramsey! I found nothing but a slew of personal statements......Bankruptcy is the Root of All Evil -- because if you go bankrupt, why on earth would you need Ramsey's seminars and books?Ramsey is making a mint -- preying upon the desperate multitudes in serious consumer debt. He is no better than those he condemns.Working two jobs, 7 days a week? My God, with that kind of lifestyle you risk a lot of health problems as well as shattered relationships with your spouse and children.Save your money for a good bankruptcy attorney -- trust me, it's not gut wrenching end of the world that Ramsey would have you believe.MANY MILLIONAIRES GO BANKRUPT AT LEAST ONE TIME BEFORE MAKING A FORTUNE.Ramsey suggests not spending money on worthless things -- well, I sure wasted money buying this worthless collection of inane drivel."
3,Ehhh...,"I don't really see the point. Instead of getting to the plan, 2/3 of the book are personal stories(that I ignored) and him talking about the plan(which gets repetitive). When you take out the extra you can get everything down in thirty pages or less."
5,Worked for me!,I was so motivated after reading this I cut up all of my credit cards. Almost 3 years later I am close to having no debt aside from my mortgage. He will change you life--give it a chance.
5,A MUST for your Financial goals!,"We got this book as a gift for Christmas and it is amazing! Very easy to read, quick to read, and also enetertaining- it will turn the way you look at your bills and accounts upside down.We are anxious to make a few changes and pay things a little differently- and Dave is VERY motivational to help it happen. What a great gift for yourself or someone you love--- MONEY FREEDOM!Highly recommend this one.... for me, MORE motivational and simple than reading Suze Ormon, and I like her a lot! This book will get you on track."
3,More money than sense.,"First let me say, I have been a fan of Dave Ramsey since about 2007. We applied some of his plan to our debt and financial situation, but tweaked it to fit our need and not his opinion as a bazillionare. I tried the advice of 'sell the car' and get a $1,000 beater to drive, but that put us further in the hole with car repairs everymonth. The 'total' money makeover is great if you are in deep. If you just need a basic plan and don't want to live on rice and beans as Dave says, we did a simple 7 Steps to Eliminate Your Debt, and paid off over $50K of debt in 2 years. Overall, Dave is great and I know has helped tens of thousands of people. I heard he just updated his seminars to 9 weeks instead of 13, which is a good thing. The 13 week one I attended lost nearly half the crowd half way through it. Yep, I think debt is dumb, but I'm not going to beat you up for things like a reasonable mortgage and car payment.Dan W. 'Senseandmoney'"
1,BAD,"THIS WOULD NOT MAKE A GOOD R-RATED MOVIE. THE NUDE SEENS WERE TO HARD TOO SEE, AND SHORT. IT;S ALMOST PG-13. DON'T BUY!!!"
3,Canvas Depth,"These canvases are only 3/4"" deep. They are braced with a centered cross instead of corner braces. They'll work okay...but not ideal."
5,InuYasha Messenger Bag,Love this bag.Came in condition promised.But it took too long to arrive.Was late for event ordered for even though it waspurchased at a reasonable time for it to arrive.
1,worthless piece of dung,"regardless of the fact that i am a 9th grader in washington state (we are required to take washington state history) and i was forced to read this book and do a power outline for each chapter (power outlines are evil), this book isn't very good... It taught me about washigton state and its history and all that STUFF... but it didn't make it very interesting... iw ould have to say that the way he wrote it is the worst way you could ever write a text book like this.... actually... im just giving it 1 star because i hate the power outlines... if i were assigned to just read the book (my teacher would never give us such mercy, being in hi-cap), it wouldn't be as bad... i can't remember anyhitng from any chapter... ya, i hate the book, alot"
4,an entertaining easy read....,"I enjoyed this book. The dialog/verbal sparring between the two characters was great. The princess held her own in a variety of interesting circumstances. The story wrapped up a bit too neatly but left several items unsolved. Her character was strong, his a bit soft. The bodyguard Burr was most enjoyable. I've not read too many ""pirate"" novels but i enjoyed this."
1,very disappointed but hopful,"I am an fan of greiman, but this book was for me very difficult read. First of all , It was totally unbelivible. That he would after days of knowing her he still thinks her to be Megs. The side story about Gem and Burr is more interesting than the main story line. Which brings up the point that it left you hanging, I mean did wheaton kidnap gem? Did she leave of her own free will. If not did she take his favorit hores to ensure that he will come after her. I mean I cared more about Gem and Burr's romance then tatianna's anf carin's. Well that's how I feel about that book. Hope it is a help."
2,Nice book .......... but,This book looks good on the bookcase. That's about it.Little will be learned from this book that couldn't be found in other places.Skip this book.
5,very good for beginners,wow. this book is simply gorgeous. for a beginner like me it is a very informative coverage on the art of woodworking. beautifully and clearly illustrated on every page it teaches.not only does it explain the hows and whys of hand tools' functions/application but also give plenty of tips and advice on how to avoid (costly) mistakes.
5,Just buy it. You'll use it.,"Watson knows how to teach! The hand drawn illustrations are marvelous, the descriptions of the tools & methods of using them are superb, the projects have practical value. This is a good example of a must have book for those working with hand tools. Even if you are experienced, you'll find good tips here."
5,Useful book,"This book, required reading for boatbuilding students at the Landing School, is a terrific resource for anyone using handtools. It covers usage, care, and maintenance of hand tools. A valuable reference book that I will keep handy in my toolroom."
1,What you see if NOT what you get - YUCK!,"The watch you see here is not the watch that will be shipped to you. What you get is a cheap elastic band with three snaps and the face of the watch has two pleather strapps attached to each end and the face is snapped to the cheap elastic band. The elastic band was so cheap it was unraveling. Activia put the watch in a dirty, nasty watch box which stains I will spare you and not describe. Stave yourself the hassle, don't buy this watch or any other watch with teh name Activia attached."
2,"Passable guide, but certainly not a reference book","A very brief and concise view of venture capital structures, but also somewhat basic in content. Examples could use more details (e.g., the sample weighted average anti-dilution calculations).Disappointed that the author does not address more complicated security structures other than common and straight convertible preferred. Also, I was surprised given the recent publication date that there was not a comparison on how deal terms have changed from the dot-com boom and bust.Certainly not a must have book for my bookshelf.Sahlman's Entrepreneurial Venture is a much better ""reference"" book and cheaper too."
5,Great Book - But Even Better is Author DVD Called Negotiating Term Sheets & Valuations in VC Deals,This author definitely knows his stuff - but even better is author's new product called Negotiating Term Sheets and Valuations in Venture Capital Deals (ISBN 1597010987). It is a 100 minute DVD that has a lot of different material in it that is critical for doing venture capital deals. It also covers specific negotiation strategies and roles and motivations for each key deal participant - which is not covered in this book or the authors other book (Term Sheets & Valuations).
4,Solid reference for entrepreneurs,"'Deal Terms' is a solid reference for entrepreneurs with 'need-to-read' (as opposed to 'nice-to-read') information regarding venture financing deals. I find Wilmerding's interviews with various relevant players (e.g. legal counsellor, venture capitalist, entrepreneur) to be a good differentiator of the book; the quick analysis of actual term sheet is also pragmatic. The 'Valuation' section is relatively generic & is the weaker part of the book."
1,Spiritual Guidance?,"As a Christian, I did not find the 12 spiritual lessons helpful, because they were not Biblically based."
5,Love this case! Can't beat the price!,"I love this case. It completely fits my Zune 30gb and all of the accessories that I have. I can neatly carry everything in my carry-on bag on the plane. Sometimes I don't need the bag, I just throw my Zune and headphones in my purse. But for long trips (car and plane) this Zune case is awesome. And I love that it's a real branded ""Zune"" case and not aftermarket. I think the newer Zunes might be smaller, so not sure if they would fit as well in this case."
4,Useful product,"I like this product a lot. I like how the Zune fits in gear bag, even with plastic case I have. I like having all my Zune accessories all together with my Zune. This case is very sturdy. What would make it 5 stars for me would be if I could plug the earphones into the Zune while it was still in the case and if there was a little strap outside the case."
3,Pretty big,"The bag... or case I should say... looks nice and does well to protect my zune. I don't like how large it is though. Any MP3 player accessory/case I can't fit in my BDU/DCU cargo pockets means it doesn't get used very often. On top of that, the outer canvas material on the case is prone to getting filled with dust, probably won't be a problem back in the states, but in Afghanistan it's a constant nuisance. I won't return it, because I think this will be great to store and protect my zune when not in use."
3,Gear Bag,This a good item if you have a 120G or bigger. Not really for a 4 or 8G. But really good at holding all your items that you may have.
4,Better than expected,"I was amazed at how durable this bag is. There are straps or enclosures to secure whatever you place inside. Theres enough space for the car charger plug, aux plug, and more!!! Great item for the price. It also says Zune on the front and the zipper so it's official!!!!"
5,Zune Happy,"Great little carrying case. Got Zune, wall plug,ear plugs, charger cable for computer and armband for workout in this case. Would have loved to have had room for the plug for my car allowing me to charge and play in the car. Just took it on a trip, and it was so nice to have everything in one sturdy storage box. Love it!!!"
5,Premium high quality material,"If you want to take your music on the go, this box makes it easy to store and carry your player, earphones, car charger, and whatever else you need. Yes, I did just call it a box. It has a hard frame to protect your stuff. So it shouldn't be called a ""gear bag"", it should be called a gear box! Get it? It also has a soft compartmentalized interior."
3,too bulky,"I bought this to keep all my gear in for my zune hd. It's very big and bulky though, too big to carry in my everyday bag. I might use it for long trips though. I guess I should have paid more attention to the size before ordering."
4,Sturdy Zune Gear Bag,"This gear bag has proven itself to be sturdy and convenient. Its an ideal size - fits right in my truck's glove box with room to spare. The only down side that I've found is the cut out for the Zune is not big enough to accommodate a case. The unit has to be removed from its case if you intend to store it in the larger gear bag. I found it just easier to store the cables and plugs in the gear bag and keep the Zune within the case I use to hang from my belt when alking/jogging. Otherwise, I don't regret this purchase."
4,good deal for the price,"I ordered this bag when it was still sold for 1$ a piece. For that price it definitely is worth its money. From looking at the inside you can tell that it was made for the older zunes, mainly the big ones. I have a 16gig one and the cutout is much too big but it has a strap that keeps the zune in place so it's ok. The other half of the bag has a mesh construction that keeps cords and headhpones and whatever else you need for your zune in place. Again, the space provided is way too much for a regular zune and components. I used it for mine and my wife's zune and ipod and cables and headphones for traveling and it worked out perfect for that. Overall it's a good bag for lots of gear at a decent price."
4,Great Product,This product is great for purpose it was made for. It accomodates all the neccesary accesories of the ZUNE player +. I highly recomends it.
5,"Great Case, But","This case is really only functional for the 80GB zune player, granted I love using it when I travel even though I only have the smaller variations. I would say it's a great buy."
4,Zune Accessory,"This product provides superb protection or your Zune and your machine will work perfectly while being carried in the ""bag"". It's made of high-impact plastic mainly and really is well built. I was actually surprised to get such a product for such a small price. This is one product I recommend to everyone."
4,ZUNE Bag,It's a little bit bulky but hold all the accessories that I had purchased for my Zune Gen 1 Unit. It's great travel bag to include in the check luggage.
4,Book on Scottish Tartans,This book is very informative for the tartans of a particular clan.Unfortunately it does not contain mmuch information on the septs of clans.
3,worth the coin,skip vol. 1 and buy this 2nd volume. It will keep you interested for more than one spin.
3,Not the quality of the first,"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this CD, it took three weeks between the order and the time it arrived. Was it worth the wait? Yes, but I was still a little disappointed. It wasn't the CD that I was expecting. Celtic Women 1 was an amazing CD. This was still good, but not great.Still, the CD features some return visitors from the first and a few great songs amongst them. Aine Furey makes a triumphant return with the song Vanities child, which highlights her haunting voice. I anxiously await the release of her band, Bohinta's new CD.Highlights are:Rita Connolly - ValparaisoFiona Joyce - Lifting the veilAine Furey - Vanity ChildIf you don't have the first one, buy it first. Followed by the Faire Celts CD which is another tremendous display of the female Celtic voice."
2,"Be careful - there are two series of ""Celtic Women"" albums. This is the worse one.","My wife and I bought the album ""Celtic Women"" a few months ago and _loved_ it. We couldn't stop playing it. We even went to the concert when it came through our city. Then I saw this and thought it was the sequel, but it is not. It is nowhere near as good. The ""Celtic Women"" with a blue cover and a red-haired woman's face on the front was released in 2004. This ""Celtic Women 2"" was released in 2000, so it is apparently a different series. If you're like me and buy this thinking that it is a sequel you will be very dissappointed."
3,"Celtic Woman, Vol. 2 Review","I purchased this CD for my husband because he so enjoyed the first Celtic Woman CD I had purchased for him. We have not enjoyed this CD as much as the first one. It hss grown on us, however, as we listen to it more. Several of the songs are very different and not at all what I thought would be on the CD. I assumed it would be the same artists as the first one and would have similar songs to the first one. The service I received in ordering this CD was great."
2,Just not the same!,"I purchased this thinking it was the women from the PBS special. It wasn't, and it wasn't nearly as good. The singing had no emotion and the song selection wasn't that great. Skip and buy the real thing with Meav, Lisa, Chloe, et al. I gave this one and Celtic Woman, Vol. 1 away."
3,"Not Close to ""Celtic Woman"" (1?)","I was THRILLED when I saw there was a follow-on CD to the wonderful ""Celtic Woman"" CD! Now I'll be more cautious if a ""Celtic Woman 3"" comes out & listen to it somewhere before buying it. Don't musicians realize that pumping something out just 'cuz they're ""hot"" isn't always the smartest thing? You can tell the original ""Celtic Woman"" was fine tuned to perfection, ""2"" is NOT."
3,"Celtic Woman, Vol. 2",It was a good Celtic CD but not as good the Celtic Woman CD. There is a nice variety on the CD. I wish I would have heard it before purchasing it.
2,Celtic Women 2,"This was a gift for my husband, who loves the original Celtic Women Vol. 1. He was dissapointed because it is not the same artists or the same style of music. He actually changed to another CD before getting to the end."
3,A bargain at this price,"First some info. This live recording was made in 1958 and stars Boris Christoff in the title role and Teresa Berganza as Dulcinea. Since this is my only receording with either Christoff or Berganza, I have no point of reference as to whether these are great or merely good performances. Given that this is an Opera D'oro release, I feel a commentary on the sound is in order since the sound quality tends to vary quite a bit across their releases. Generally, the sound is good. There's no audience noise, and the vocalists are recorded well. The sound of the orchestra lacks definition in places, but it is not bad. There's a little distortion when the chorus kicks in full, but again, it is not terribly bothersome. Overall, this is a good value. By the way, I interpret 3 stars as ""good""."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Mama Mia! A French opera sung in Italian with no warning! Forget about a libretto, none is included. The sound quality is marginal at times. When the orchestra or chorus get in full swing forget it, saturation is the name of the game. Solo vocals are surprisingly good.So much for the negative, you can't beat the price. A good opportunity to experience an under performed French opera, albeit from a decidedly Italian perspective."
2,Time for a new recording...,"Those who wish a recording of this underappreciated opera are in a quandry. There ARE good recordings out there, but they're not available in the US. This is the only one I could find on the Internet. While the performances and orchestra are satisfactory, the sound is not. I realize that this is a bargain basement priced recording, but you should realize that what you hear will sound like an old radio broadcast.Currently, Ruggero Raimondi is performing this role and I had a chance to see him. It would be great if he and others who had performed with him would record this soon. Perhaps a project for a new Massenet conductor, Antonio Pappano?"
1,Disappointed!,We opened the Xylophone to find that there were no wooden mallets in the box to play it and I have not resolved yet how to get them.
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for a better quality xylophone for my kids, who are really into music - and I am not happy with my choice. I wanted to avoid the tinny sounds of a cheap version, but this one doesn't cut the mustard. 2 notes are the same and the tone is poor. Pretty to look at, but I wouldn't recommend this for the money."
5,Super sweet! Super Cute! Great sound for a toy!,"I really love this and so does my 5 and 2 year olds. We are a musical family and find the quality of the sound to be just perfect for a toy instrument. Far superior to the metal versions. Each bar has its own accurate and very pleasant tone, not too loud and not too quiet. You really can play little songs on it. My son takes piano and he sits with it in his lap playing the songs he knows - they sound very nice. Highly recommended. What they don't mention is that near the handle is a little slot to store the mallats when it is not in play - great feature!"
3,"beautiful, but not the best for music","this is one of the most beautiful toy xylophones on amazon. the sound is interesting, too, but it's not designed to play a scale like you would think by looking at it. an earlier review mentioned that the keys are not labelled - this makes sense to me now after using it in person. it doesn't play true notes, so it wouldn't make sense to label the keys. i do however appreciate the design and the fact that it comes with two mallets."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"Please don't waste your money buying this Xylophone, it's very pretty to look at but that's all. It sounds like a drum instead of a xylophone. the tone is horrible. It's made in CHINA not ITALY so concerned about lead too. Such a waste, I'm returning this."
4,great toy,"I bought this for my 15 month old grandson and he loved it immediately. Has decent tone, though yes not a true scale. At his age it does not matter-I just want him to like music. For some reason he likes to turn it over and strike the back of the keys also. Seems well made."
2,Repetition is annoying,"First, let me say I'm not a fan of anthologies, so I may be a little biased. Short stories by thier very nature can't hold your attention, because by the time you get into the story it's over. I am a big fan of Magic the Gathering and own almost all the books published so far, so I purchased this one to add to my collection. It suffered from everything I hate about anthologies and then some. Every story had a story within a story structure that started with one character begining a ""once upon a time..."" type narration. The one redeeming story used this same structure but built upon Magic lore from another anthology."
1,Well written but that is the high point,I am stuck reading this book for a class. And I am very surprised that a professor would use such a self serving book as the text book. The terminology used in the books is a misuse of scientific terms for the authors conjectures. And the author's imaginary critic that he pose in the the book offers no real criticisms of the theories and is just used as an idiotic foil to make the author seem like he has all of the answers. This book offers a lot of guesses with nothing substantial to back them up.
3,Basic concepts of language,"This is a fairly well organized book for basic concepts of language. And some extrapolation of the conclusions on language is ventured for some other aspects of human nature. The Argument for Mental Grammar leads through the basic evidence leading to the conclusion that much of human language is innate. Any analysis of sentences leaves questions where rules underlying structure could arise. I would say it seems very introductory and add some negative remarks on the author's style.He adds these silly pencil drawings a few times to help us ""picture"" his arguments. A bit childish. I wish the author would move a lot faster through the arguments. I get up to page 44 for instance, and here he is comparing the human brain operation to a videotape. What! When you're done though, you are left with a decent perspective on the language faculty. Keep writing reviews on these things people."
4,"Surprisingly good, very inventive!!!","I have to admit that I had not heard of Miguel prior to this recording. I had the pleasure of hearing this recording in the record store of a friend of mine. Miguel has a beautiful tone but unlike players with such a gift he doesn't exploit it that by playing to that asset. He improvises excellently, he embellishes and knows when not to play. The player he most reminds me of is Lee Konitz.Antonio Sanchez's drumming is just priceless. He shows why he is one of the up and coming drummers out there. Luis Pendoino's playing is a fine cross of intellect and heart. Hans Glawishing is a fine bassist with a lyrical style kind of like Eddie Gomez.I think this a good balance of good playing and good material. The arrangments are excellent.I will be looking forward to his next release, while playing this recording a great deal."
3,To little for the money,Expensive book with lots of mistakes. Has some useful information but could have been better organized.
2,Not helpful to me,"The content was very simplistic - I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. Also, the book is rife with typos and grammatical errors. That made me question the book's credibility; especially considering the topic is book publishing."
1,Since Thornton Publishing is so well known....,"...in the publishing industry, the veracity of this book speaks for itself."
4,More or less what I expected from broad coverage but didn't reference my clutch type,"Got this for a 1971 Honda CT70. Clymer does a fairly decent job of covering so many different model years/models in a single book.This broad coverage makes it sort of inconvenient to find the exact section that covers my bike, but this is probably the reason it is still in publication.I've only used it to help fix a shifting problem and change the oil so far. The troubleshooting gave pointed to the geneneral areas to look, but it was some phone advice from an avid collector and self discovery that fixed the problem.It seems to cover 4 or 5 different ""Types"" of clutch designs but does not list my bike as one of the types making it slightly confusing, but the other models were similar enough to be of help.Great deal if you own multiple models/years of bikes covered by this book."
3,Preaching the Kingdom of God,"This book is a useful tool in the ever-evolving discussion of Christian preaching. As always, David Buttrick is not short of opinions as to what is wrong with the church. He tirades about the shortcomings of the church so much so that you get the impression that God has given up on the church. With Buttrick, one is sure that the church is not the Kingdom of God; however, is it useless as he seems to say? Buttrick is perfectly happy with Jewish concepts of kingdom (rule) but the church is just no good. One gets the impression that for Buttrick the post modern Christian is just a good Democrat. Aside from this, Buttrick is always interesting to read. His use of words is interesting and engaging."
4,"Reviews are great, cost is lower","I love the reviews by people that have purchased this camera. I just ordered it along with a bundled kit that contains a 32Mb card, charger, case and batteries. The only unfortunate part is that I found mine through ZDnet for $100 LESS."
4,"Great image quality, good value, but slow to focus & shoot","Purchased with a 128MB flash card, which gives about 120 low-compression JPEG 1600x1200 images. I'm very happy with the image quality, but it takes the camera about 1.5 seconds to focus & shoot from initial shutter press, which is too slow for my style. However, you can pre-focus by holding the shutter down halfway which reduces the shoot time to about 0.1 sec.The autobracket, white balance, priority and full manual, and flash intensity features are welcome (and necessary for many shots), but it takes a lot of button pushing to access them in the menus.I don't have much use for the QuickTime movie feature; the 320x240 resolution is too low to be useful and it eats RAM like crazy.If you buy this camera, I highly recommend you also purchase the Olympus CLA-1 lens adapter tube and a 43mm filter for same, to get some armor on the delicate zoom lens."
5,Olympus C2040 digital camera,"I really like this camera. The operating instructions included a quick start page of just the necessary basics to get started taking pictures. The more detailed instruction booklet was clearly written and included diagrams. This was very helpful. The camera's controls are easy to use. The picture quality in daylight or flash is very good. I had a problem connecting the camera to my computer through the USB port. My computer running Microsoft XP wouldn't recognize it and would freeze up. The software that came with the camera did not seem to help. I currently download pictures to the computer through my hp Photosmart printer which can read the smart card. A little round-a-bout, but workable for now. Overall, however, I am very satified with the camera."
3,lots of designes,we were looking for beaded ornaments with a more challanging bead design. These are pretty but not what we had in mind
2,Out of date,This travel guide gives great details but it so out of date that you aren't sure what information is current and isn't. The website might be a better choice.
2,Stereo Connection No Longer Works,"Agree with other reviews. Reaction time has always been very slow. Worked well in the beginning. After about 5 months, the player still works through the TV, but no longer sends audio to my stereo. Going in the trash very soon....what a waste of money."
1,Save your money,"This is the worst DVD player I've ever owned.1. The controls are terrible: they are unresponsive from the remote AND the front panel.2. When the machine is turned off, say in the middle of a movie to go to sleep and watch the rest tomorrow, it doesn't remember where it left off from. Toshiba has no fix for this problem.3. If you stop the movie for an extended break, the unit turns off automatically. Refer to #2 for additional info.4. My machine (about 8-12 months old)was received non-functioning. Toshiba sent me a refurb'd replacement, which is now dying too.I've seen other dvd players out there with HDMI upconverting (1080i)...try one of those instead."
1,Who made this junk,Here's a peice of advise STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD PLAYER. This has got to be the worst peice of equipment I have ever purchased for my home theater system. I have owned this player for less than three months and it stopped working last week. It has been nothing but problems since day one. Since I have purcahsed it I have not been able to watch a full 30 minutes with out it freezing or chopping the picture or turning off all toghter. The remote's response time is VERY slow and picture quality is mediocre at best (yes even with the HDMI) and this is on a Pioneer ELITE monitor. If you are looking for a quality DVD player then take my advice and look elsewhere.
1,Poor UI and poor performance,"I chose the Toshiba SD5970 when I bought an HD LCD TV last December. I have been displeased with the unit from nearly the beginning. But the malfunctions did not start to occur until after the 90 day warranty period, of course.It has one of the worst designed remotes I've ever seen: a block of mono-colored and mono-sized buttons. No chance at being able to navigate by touch.It seems to hang up on nearly every DVD I watch. Sometimes, if I press remote keys too quickly, like going from pause to FF to Play, it will freeze. It hardly ever gets all the way through a DVD without freezing. I have to power down and and then patiently navigate back to the place where it died to watch the remainder.I have not had time to call tech support yet. I know I don't want another one of these. I probably wasted $180 on this, as it will probably end up being a throwaway. I can't recommend this model."
1,Does not play DVD+/-R discs!,"Do yourself a favor and bypass this player if you are planning on using dvd recordable discs. I bought this player yesterday and will be returning it today. It states in the manual that it can handle recordable dvd's, however when you go to use the player, it is an entirely different story altogether. You will notice that there is frequent pixelation and hanging up when watching recorded video. As far as handling store bought videos, it does great. Another negative though is the fact that, as another reviewer pointed out, the player doesn't remember where you left off when stopping a disc. The video starts over from the beginning. Movies also begin with subtitles enabled and you have to shut them off manually each time you go to watch a movie. Not a great product in my opinion."
2,Not worth the hassle,"This is the most frustrating DVD player I've ever owned. When it works, it's fine, but . . .Remote is badly designed, you need a light on to use the thing. The pause button is buried between the repeat button and the fluorescent dimmer. Why?I can deal with the remote. The biggest problem is that it is very slow to recognize discs if it does so at all. If the disc is not pristine and dust free, it skips or simply doesn't recognize at all. I don't even bother with it using the kids CDs anymore, too frustrating.My $39 Apex is far more reliable.Update 2/2006:Player totally failed 1/2006. I swore at the time to never buy another Toshiba product. But . . .I called Toshiba Customer Support and they sent me a new player (SD-6980) which so far is fantastic (and adds new features as well):- Good remote- Reads most any disc- Flash card reader- DIVX support"
1,Breaks easily,This is the second Toshiba DVD player I've owned. The first broke after 2 years. This one broke in less than 1 year. If you are even considering purchasing a Toshiba I would strongly suggest getting an extended warranty as they break quickly.
1,Waste of money,"I bought it to match my Toshiba HDMI TV. The machine is very frustrating to use. Repeatedly rejects some discs. Usually requires the user to press the same button more than once before the requested action occurs. Mine was in the shop for a few months but came back unchanged. I bought a different brand and put this one away to save as a backup, but I'm hoping to never use it again."
1,Do not buy this.,DO NOT BUY!I concur with all the bad reviews:- Open/Close takes 5 tries- Remote stinks- Went bad after 6 months - cannot load brand new disks- Only 90 Day WarrantyVery dissapointed - I feel scammed
2,"Glitchy, Early Death","Bought this unit in early 2005 because it was recommended by a consumer magazine. From day one the control buttons were slow to respond, often requiring multiple pushes, but that was tolerable because the picture looked great using the HDMI output. The occassional DVD would freeze up, but that wasn't a frequent problem. Overall, it performed adequately--until it died only a few months off warranty. One evening we turned it on and the DVD we'd left in it started to spin, but the display was dead, the tray wouldn't open, and there was no signal output--not even the welcome screen. I had to pry it open to salvage the disc trapped inside. If it weren't for the HDMI cable that was included with the unit and the 15 months of use, this thing would have earned the lowest rating."
1,Not sure what to think yet,"Just received it in the mail last week. Plugged it in. Invited 15 friends over to enjoy the new DVD player and watch a few old movies... What a disappointment!First the Open/Close button was very ""sticky."" Took about 5 tries to get the tray open. I put a DVD in. Closed the tray. The LCD display kept saying ""No Disc."" I took a deep breath, opened and closed the tray several times, hoping for a temporary ""glitch"". Still ""No Disc."" I try 5 other movies. None of them played! 15 friends went home pretty disappointed!!At this point I'm thinking I got a lemon or that it was damaged in transit. Soooooo, I'm keeping the faith and replacing it for the same model. Hopefully won't have any more problems. I love Toshibas and the price of this player. Crossing my fingers!! I will post an update when I get my replacement (hopefully soon)."
1,"Buggy product, do not recommend.","I do not recommend buying this product. I opened a brand new Star Wars DVD and mid-way during the movie, it skipped to a different section of the movie. I checked the DVD and there were no scratches and no dust in the DVD player. A few minutes later, the sound went completely off. I tried a few different audio cables to no avail, the solution for me was to turn the player off, and then turn it back on... after that, I got sound again. I will concur with other reviewers that this product is buggy, and it's a waste of $150 - I've gotten better bug-free performance from a $40 DVD player from Costco, which was made from solid metal unlike this flimsy plastic buggy POS. Also, the Open button on the player often needs to be pressed several times before it will actually open the tray for DVD insertion, and this is very annoying."
3,Good but requires patience,"Got this HDMI-connected player to go along with a new Sony LCD projector HDTV. The picture via HDMI and Porgressive Scan outputs is great and I would give the player a higher rating if it weren't for the remote (which is bizarrely designed) and sluggish performance of the unit's software. I previously thought these would be minor concerns, but, once I experienced the joy of waiting 1 minute for the DVD to complete loading, or the equal delight of repeatedly pressing the Open/Close button with no response, I found them harder to ignore. Still, if these issues wouldn't bother you, I would recommend the unit for picture and sound quality. As of this writing, the SD-5970 gives you some excellent features for the price."
2,Poor Engineering,"Was great for first 6 months. Then the trouble started. Constant error messages, wouldn't read the disc, would lock up during playback. Now it will not even read any disc, just error messages. It is useless and have only had it for 9 months. Stay away from this one."
1,Fell apart within 5 weeks,"The good reviews got me to buy this - I have a plasma, so I wanted to HDMI upconversion. Unfortunatley this thing has many problems. BUYER BEWARE!1. It's remote is laid out very poorly, nothing is easy to find on it.2. It comes on very slowly, sometimes, just to get the tray to open, it takes 3 or 4 trys.3. It SKIPS! No, it's not my DVD, I have another and tested the same section of the movie and it didn't. The player just froze, like a slow computer when it has too much to handle.I am returning this item today, luckily BestBuy had an extended return policy during the holiday. You may not be so luckily. I do NOT suggest this product unfortunatley."
1,DOES NOT WORK AFTER 6 MONTHS,"I have to throw it away after less than 6 months. I have seen that many people are having the same problem. Great features while it works, but it only last 6 months before you get the ""BAD"" message on the screen.Do not buy this product."
1,Dead on Arrival (almost),"I bought the SD-5970 two months ago to replace a very, very reliable Panasonic DVD player (five years old) that I ""fried"" by carelessly placing it on top of a receiver. As related in other reviews, the remote (with awkwardly placed buttons) is sluggish to the point of thinking the batteries are perpetualy dead. I lived with that. Then, after a month, DVDs that used to play no longer play in the machine, displaying ""BAD."" Indeed, nothing plays. ""Setup"" also no longer works. Pair this with the class action lawsuit against Toshiba for my laptop computer ... and I caution consumers against buying any of their products. I expected more from a Japanese electronics company."
4,"Ok, not great","I bought this DVD player in late September while waiting for the Sony model to come out. While it outputs a very good signal (I have an HDMI connection to a LCD HDTV), the dvd player itself if often a big pain. I generally have to push a button about three times, holding down the button for a second each time, before the dvd notices and responds. This is true for both the box itself and the remote. Also the remote has a very narrow acceptance angle. It clearly mentions on the box that this player comes with a HDMI cord. While it has been a good player, I intend to return mine and buy Sony's version once it is available. Overall it is good quality, its about $100 cheaper than Sony's, but the response to controls leaves much to be desired."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE if you plan to use the HDMI interface!!!!,"Toshiba is ""recalling"" this DVD player due to poor HDMI performance. Visit their website:http://www.tacp.toshiba.com/dvd/select customer supportand then updates/notices.The SD-5960 will be in the pop up window."
2,Should have read these reviews first!,"It worked okay for about a year, now the LCD won't come on, so I have no idea where I am in the movie. I agree with these reviews entirely. Not a good buy."
1,Complete Garbage,"Consider yourself lucky if this thing will play 75% of the DVDs you load up, discs that will play just fine on other players. Sometimes it simply freezes up during playback and becomes totally unresponsive until you remove and re-apply power; half the time the meager controls on the front panel don't work and the other half, it's ignoring input from the horrendously-designed remote. It fails to power up part of the time as well. I'd chalk it up to a faulty unit, except I'm now on my third one (even Best Buy won't do a refund on it) with all the same problems. I'd give this thing 0 stars if Amazon had a rating that low. Avoid this junker."
2,"Good name, bad product","While the HDMI and video quality are very good in HD, the device itself is poorly made. In fact my unit no longer plays DVD after about 5 uses (It says ""BAD"" when a DVD is inserted. I've attempted all manor of troubleshooting). The remote is particularly bad - it makes the Apex brand look good."
3,Nice Tie,"I wish the silk was a higher quality, it is made out of very thin silk which after a few times of putting on the tie starts to wear out."
5,So funny and so true,"Rescue from House Gorgeous:1) Deeply personal, brutally honest memoir2) So funny your sides ache3) Inspiring4) Real5) GeniusWhat are you spending your time, energy, and money on?Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you actually had time to have one outside of work?When was the last time you spent free time having fun instead of maintaining your home, your garden, or your own appearance?You don't have to have a near-death experience in order to radically re-prioritize life over style. All you have to do is read this book."
3,OK But not really the old one that I wanted,"I purchased this thinking that it was the same model as the one that I had obtained several years ago. It looks the same as my old 512MB Data Traveler, but it is called Hi-Speed. So It does not work with my old Win98. Otherwise it is fine.Kingston DataTraveler I - 4 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DTI/4GB"
5,THE BEST THING A TRAVELING MOTHER COULD HAVE!!!,"I go on the city bus a lot with my daughter who is almost 4. She loves the different games on it, especially ""Scratch Off"". It keeps her busy for long lengths of time and we've even made a few ""games"" of our own on the system. We time each other while playing ""Scratch Off"" and after three seconds, we stop scratching away and try to guess what the picture is. It's lots of fun. I even steal away a few minutes of playing with the Puzzle game and Repeat Me game. I recommend this product to anyone with a child under the age of 7/8 because most kids older than that get tired of it quickly."
3,Ok translation,"I thought this book was hardbound, but it is just paperback. The translation is not as close to the English version as I had expected. Its the same story, just not word for word."
5,My son loves it too!,"This book is written in a very good spanish, the story is nice and my son loves the dogs characters."
1,Boring Boring Boring,Is anyone besides me tired of romances where the characters marry for reasons not relating to love then spend the next 200 pages in love but unable to tell their partner or have sexual relations? It is soooo boring! I ususally love Ms. Metzger's books but this book was overdone and it was unreasonable for Galen and Margo to have not consummated their marriage much sooner. The reasons for the delay just got plain silly.
3,it's okay,"Overall, it works. There were a couple of times while I was playing, that it fell off which was disruptive."
1,useless,Just put the ball in your pocket. Putting a ball in this little plastic thing is hard. It is tricky. You won't want to mess with this little useless plastic piece while you are playing some serious game. It is just annoying. It is hard to put it in and surprisingly the ball in it will not stay stable.
2,So-So,"If not moving too quickly, the clip is wonderful. The second you begin to run, the clip begins to bounce and pops off."
5,Hardcore from start to finish,"Great tracks from Aquasky and 4Hero make this comp unforgettable and impervious to age. Maybe Moonshine has some better acts signed, but then again, maybe not. Expensive, but worth the import."
2,Second-rate No. Miss. All-Stars,"Despite being produced by the legendary Jim Dickinson--father to the brothers who lead the North Mississippi All-Stars--this CD is as disappointingly tiresome/enervating as the first Tarbox CD. The hype is overdone, folks.I admire the apparent intent (to update the country blues a la the North Mississippi All-Stars, but with more ""depth"" and ""art""), but cannot applaud the mostly annoying results."
2,two sided map,"The map appears to be durable and has details.But, the thing that I had difficulty with since only half of the country appears on either surface is there is no contiguous edge.Trying to get distances (or directions) across the map boundry is needlessly complicated. Coming up from the south to the upper map edge and trying to continue to the north of the country means a)noting the horizontal coordinate at point of interest, b) rotating to the right and c)then looking for your coordinate at your point of crossing which is now at the bottom of the map. Far easier would have been to have the upper surface of the bottom half match up with the lower surface of the top map at the edge. Accessed by rotating top to bottom. Flip back and forth to try alternative routes. Horizontal position doesn't move.Is this the first map that Rough has ever done?Disappointed,EEB"
2,Not that much detail,"When I bought this product, other reviews led me to believe this would be a very dtailed map. It's not. We bought the Ordinance Survey Atlas. (65 pages of maps, spiral bound) Even that didn't have the level of detail needed to find some of the more obscure historic markers in the Dingle peninsula for instance. You won't get lost with the Rough Guide map, you won't necessarily be able to find all the sites of interest."
4,Good but not the best,Its a good hood but it is annoying how there is not an opening for the cables to come out the top. It causes the hood to not fit evenly.
4,Color lasts,The best of several hunter orange collars that I have purchased. The color lasted about three years before fading. Very flexible plastic-type material did not wear at all in that amount of time.
4,"Sexy, bluesy","In the voice, there's a taste of the little innocent white girl playing at being bad, but these are terrific cuts. I don't know what happened to her -- maybe she's still singing in Austin, Texas -- but this is one fine album that I love as much now as when I first heard it."
4,Lou Ann's 2nd best,"The vocals are excellent, Lou Ann has the best female blues voice on the planet. Buy ""Sugar Coated Love"" first and this album 2nd. Of course I am partial to Stevie Ray Vaughn and real ""Texas Blues"" (Stevie appears on ""SCL""). There are horns on some songs on ""Old Enough"" and I personally don't like horns with my blues."
4,Excellent Book..!!! Highly Innovative..!!!,"This is an excellent book both for a teacher as well as the student. It extensively uses modern technology for explaining the complex phenomena in Physics.The Authers have called it Physlets i.e. Physics Applets.The applets presented are highly interactive, and allow the student to interact and fully understand the behaviour changes by changing various parameters.It gives an excellent grasp of the topic under discussion and also gives a sound understanding of the concepts using visual medium.The authers need to be congratulated for their highly innovative and pioneering work simplifying the pedegogy of learning/teaching physics.Large number of illustrative examples. The reader can develop his/her own Physlets.Highly recommended.-Prof.M.G.BHATIA"
3,Too much hand-holding and some code does not work,"Overall, it is a good book for a beginner, but I wish Halverson would maybe give more of a structure by which to do more programs on our own and perhaps give quizzes. Just completing lessons does not make you proficient with any language. Some of the code in the book does not work, starting with chapter 11 and 12 and then after that, all code works (however, that frustrated me and ruined the examples which were subseqent of and dependent on the exercises which contained the bad coding). However he does give some good programming secrets that will serve as a reference for the future when I need them. I only used this book so I could get some work on VB 6.0 before going on to try VBA w/Excel which is what I am working on now. I would still recommend this to anyone, but with caution."
5,Piccoli : a fairy tale,This is my favorite children's book. I have my copy from the 50s and it's pretty banged up. I read it to my son and plan to keep it for grandchildren. It would really be fabulous if it were to be reprinted!
1,How do I return the item?,I recieved the screws in good time and they appear to be what was advertised. However they were ordered along with some plastic anchors of an equal amount. These two items do not seem to be the correct size. I have been a little busy so I haven't gotten around to returning them and I acually wasn't sure how to do that.
4,"Wonderful, fascinating look into the spirit molecule!","This is a very interesting documentary about DMT, a psychedelic hormone/neurotransmitter that exists in the human body naturally, and is also found in many living organisms around the world.If you've read Rick Strassman's book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, this documentary further explores his studies by bringing in various experts to discuss their thoughts on this somewhat taboo topic. There are also face to face interviews with several of the research subjects involved in Strassman's DMT studies.If you are already interested in these kinds of things, you'll love this documentary. In addition, I think this DVD would be a great way to introduce someone to this foreign world of psychedelic experiences, thoughts, and philosophies. Where our society demonizes psychedelic drugs, this documentary does a good job in showing how pivotal such substances have been in the maturation of human beings across the vast landscape of time."
2,mental-masterbative-headache,"If you like being punished by eye-crossing, computer generated, neo-psychedelic imagery, this movie is for you. If you are into mental masturbation...this is a hit! I was interested in the film, and found the commentaries to be interesting, but the producers RUINED this film with all of the aforementioned crap. I couldn't even look at the screen after a while. Hope this helps!!"
2,"Short on facts, long on speculation",Can a drug that is in our bodies create near death experiences? This film points out that DMT exists in plants and animals but it fails to mention that it exists in only trace amounts in the human body. There is highly speculative commentary in regards to the pineal gland that the researcher himself has all but discredited. The film is professionally produced but seems more like propaganda than science.
1,This is a drug movie!!!!! Not a theoretical or philosophical movie!,"I rented this thinking it was going to be a deep thought provoking philosophical documentary, but about 5 minutes into it, my husband and I realized it was about DRUGS!!! Like LSD and foreign herbs that cause one to hallucinate, and that this is another way to connect to spirituality. WHAT?! I couldn't stop laughing, we rented a drug movie! So, despite what the reviews said, I swear, this is not about Serotonin or psychology, it is about mind altering drugs, LDS, hallucinogenic. It is really funny, I almost thought they were joking. If you are looking for a deep thought provoking documentary, this is really not the one! lol If you are high, maybe."
3,DMT: The Spirit Molecule...,"I'd like to say Hippy-bunkem but, well...not really. There is a lot of interesting insights and information about the role of certain chemicals in the brain, but for my money (though I would like to be convinced) I am not convinced of the Spiritual Nature or Significance of DMT. I'm really not.Those of us who have tasted psychedelics will be aware about amazing visions and insights that we get as a consequence of super-activity in the chemical brain under their influence,but to then call it other than great perceptions and/or profundity of thought is a little far-fetched but hey, this is only my opinion.The format is basically talking heads and a few incredible psychedelic moving films and shots: worth watching just for the latter! A little over-priced for what it is as far as I am concerned"
3,This book is meant for someone who already has a career.,As a soon to be graduating graduate student I found this book to be interesting and relevant but not of much use to someone who has never held an actual career such as myself. I could see how Burke was very thorough in the processes she came up with to assist someone with trying to choose a career but these processes were oriented to people who had careers and either lost their jobs or are unsatisfied with them. Burke especially oriented her writing toward women which is not of much help to a man. If you are a graduate or undergraduate student about to enter the work force and you have not yet held what you would consider a career position than this book is not for you. I'm sure there are books that cover this same subject and are more directed to the less experienced career searcher.
3,A must read for those changing careers.,"Dr. Anna Mae Walsh Burke has released a book called How To Choose A Career Now That You're All Grown Up. The book is chock full of relavent information regarding choosing a career or how to change the career you currently have for a better one. Included in this book are chapters on self evaluation, resumes, interveiws, communication skills and going back to school. If you never read another book about changing careers, read this one. I found it to be written in a style that was easy to understand, not a lot of technical jargon, and I found it to be very informative. This book focuses upon you the person and asks you to evaluate your hopes, wishes and dreams in order to provide yourself with some job satisfaction. In an age where down-sizing is heard everyday, this book is a must."
4,changing careers,I believe that this book would be much more helpful to someone who is in a later stage of life - someone who has had at least one career and has already started a family. The book is well-written but seems to be geared towards those who are looking to change careers and have family responsibilities... that must be reckoned with in the process.
2,Bad Book,"I bought this book because I read from other reviews that it was good, but it's a disappointment. First of all, this book doesn't have a picture of the Cinema 4D XL's user interface, showing the toolbars, icons, and other items when a person opens up the program. This is important for teaching beginners to show them what the interface looks like and what it means. Second, the author doesn't show the steps how to do things using ""Follow these steps: 1) Click this icon 2) click that, 3)... etc. Other books are much better because they offer numeric steps to teach or tell people how to do something. Third, this books does even have character animation. For beginners, it's hard to figure out how to open the Cinema 4D XL program because the author doesn't show how to use the provided cd to start the software. It's a boring and disappointing book to read. Not recommended for buying."
4,Brings back memories,"Too many years ago we watched the Cosmic Christmas on TV and then I never saw it again. I didn't realize it was included with The Littlest Angel. While the quality of the video leaves something to be desired, the story does not. It is just as sweet and moving as I remembered."
1,WHOOOOOA!!!!!,"Amazon and their unfortunate ""Marketplace"" vendors seem to be illiterate as they cannot read the product title on the video boxes!; twice I have ordered this movie and twice I've been sent the wrong product. Please do yourself a favor and write to the vendor BEFORE comitting yourself to this runaround--Amazon does not appear to care enough to verify or cancel these false listings!"
1,Boo,"We bought 2 of these so me and my 10 year old daughter could play together. We both agreed that this game made no sense, had no instructions as far as what to do or where to go. You control your character by using the a w s and d keys. It was as though the creator had many ideas and never sorted any of them out. Save your money, buy Evergirl or or even Dreamlife plug and play."
1,if i only could give a zero,"THIS much delayed game is pure waste of time if i only could give a zero.what genius thought to use letters a,w.s,and d as buttons to control movement of your character arkward at best and pain at worst.the graphics are pretty i guess they could not find any ethnic people where martin luther king.save your money on piece of unfinish junk.OR MAYBE U WANT A VEIN TO POP IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR FORE HEAD"
3,CD Good - Book Bad,"The book doesn't have much for subject matter. There is no area to look up information for reference. The book is more of workbook that is completely useless without the CD. However, the CD is helpful in that it steps through the info in a slide show in a learning type manner. (There is no audio which would make it less boring). I was hoping for a little more."
1,Doesn't convert a clear picture!,this is an adapter not a converter like the description says! It transmits a very poor picture and the sound is stereo only. The picture looks like there's a fishnet stocking covering the lense. Very poor product.
3,Pricey and too heavy!,"I have chronic neck problems due to a loss of the curve in my cervcal spine. I havea Tempur-Pedic wave pillow which does provide comfort yet I was still waking several times to turn and adjust it.. It was on my Chiropractor's advise I ordered this down water pillow.. The reasoning behind the technology seemed sound yet it does anything BUT PROVIDE A GOOD NIGHT SLEEP. It is too heavy with the amount of water needed to provide adequate support and I usually toss it off the bed in the middle of the night because it is simply too bulky and heavy. I'll stick with my Tempur-Pedic Wave pillow..It is far more user friendly..This pillow is excellent for under the knee support and elevating the torso...I would not call it a cervical-friendly pillow.It is not returnable, otherwise I would have surely sent it back."
2,"okay, but not awesome","I like the idea that the pillow will never get wear out, because you just add more water. But with that being said I would like to be able to add MORE water so the pillow is firmer."
3,A bit disappointed,"I bought and used this pillow for over a year. I found the pillow quite cumbersome to move. Although it never leaked, the water layer of the pillow eventually separated from the pillow itself making it impossible to use.The idea of the water pillow is great, and I found that my neck problems were alleviated by use of the pillow. For the price, however, it just didn't work for me."
1,"Expensive, Flat, and Uncomfortable - Save your money","Pros:- Soft- Somewhat easy to fill with water- Nice coverCons:- Too expensive- Too flat (less than 4 inches thick even when filled with 100oz water)- Did NOT ease my neck pain, but in fact made it worse- Could not feel any ""Down Plus"" difference"
5,Cannot sleep without it!,I been having neck pain for a long time. My Orthopedic surgeon recommended that pillow to me and it really works great. It is heavy when full of water but easy to take out and refill if you need to. I bought one for my mother and she too likes to sleep with it. My only problem is that if I am traveling it is too large to bring along I have a hard time getting used to other pillows.
2,Falling apart,The shoes started falling apart at the seams after 6 months. Not what I expected from a Red Wing shoe.
5,WORX by Red Wing Shoes-Men's 5525 Oblique Toe S/T Work Boot,"What can I say! This is my second purchase of Worx Boots by Red Wing in a different style and this product never fails to amaze me. The price is reasonable and the quality you cannot compare. There is no ""Break In"" period and you ""Walk In"" comfort from morning till night. I am planning to purchase another pair and would recommend it to other people who appreaciate the quality of a good product that Red Wing Shoes manufactures."
4,.Neat look,The shoe is good very well made but it could of been a little softer inside but for the the price it's good
4,Good motor...Not as powerful as expected,"This motor is sturdy and durable. It is tunable. However, I can not get the power that I would like compared to other similar motors that I use. With this said, I still prefer this motor for its durability."
2,WTF!?,"I like one piece, but when i saw the Japanese version, it made the english version look like [...]! I mean sure the show is OK, but its waayyy to cheesy. Like when someone gets shot, it just leaves a big hole in thier shirt. In the Japanese version its bloody, they swear ALOT, and the affects are much better. The English version was dubbed to much. If you liked the manga, then dont get this DVD. Its a waist of money and you'll be dissapointed how crappy it is."
1,dont bother with this,another hatchet job by an american company taking a fantastic series and dumbing it down for american children...why does sanji sound like a moron? and the rapsong for the opening...forget this crap go find the original one piece which i consider the greatest anime series of all time!
3,"Good, but surpassed","The Classics of Western Spirituality edition of Cassian's Conferences seemed extremely appealing, but it is inevitably disappointing to read out-takes from a work as majestic as the Conferences. Admittedly, the Conferences can be daunting: the standard critical edition runs to three volumes, and the recent English translation is a hefty tome of nearly 1000 pages. But (and I say this advisedly) there is no substitute for mulling over the work as a whole. So I would suggest that instead of waiting for this edition to be reprinted, consider buying Boniface Ramsey's translation in the Ancient Christian Writer's series. If you are interested enough to read a second review, then you are probably interested enough to take on an unexpurgated version."
1,Misleading and Mediocre,"Only two labels, not 20. Also, the package says there's an ""enclosed jewel case"" which there is not. Finally, the software doesn't do anything unique or valuable that isn't available better and/or better value elsewhere. In short, not a product to be bothered with."
1,Misleading Description,"I thought I was getting a deal with this package. Instead, I have two CD labels (not twenty) and a CD with software that can be downloaded from the web. If it weren't for the ... rebate, I would have demanded a refund."
5,The Gentle Weapon Is A Gift,"I received a copy of the ""Gentle Weapon"" from a dear friend and yoga student. What a gift. The words, prayers and messages always always always uplift inspire and guide me to that place of quiet serenity and trust in God. No matter what mood I'm in, I pick up The Gentle Weapon and the right prayer is always there.Share with your friends and loved ones. The words are timeless and it doesn't matter what faith or religion you are, the words will touch you.Thank you."
2,"Too experimental, a mish mash of sounds","I listened to some of Fulfilled/Complete, expecting that the Broken Spindles debut effort would hold my interest as their sophomore effort. Not so. I find the songs to be of varying quality, some have these beautiful, melodic phrases, but most have an experimental, avant-garde noisy/IDM touch that I didn't like very much."
1,New age cards designed for gulable people,"I don't liike to give negative reviews for things but this deck takes the cake. I have seen many many native american decks which are questionable but all pale in comparrison to this one. The deck simply has no feeling to it. Its as though someone took a bunch of pictures of native peoples, and I dont mean authentic medicine people, I mean pictures of supposed shamans in full head dress, you know the typical hollywood indian....well its like someone took pictures of those and then a bunch of animals and created a deck. I have to say, hats off the the creator of this thing for comming up with a way to pawn people out of their money cause anyone who buys this is only gonna get one thing out of it, being riped off."
3,Very Basic,"This book is for anyone who is doing their first presentation or has been doing presentations for only a short while. Molly Joss provides all the structural basics on doing presentations, from media types through layout and design. The book provides pointers on the best fonts, colors, and layouts to use. The treatment is basic, mainly focusing on the use of presentation software.If you are looking for a book on presentation style or issues with audience engagement, you would be best served to get a book focused on that aspect--this is not the one for you."
5,One-lens Streetshooter,"This lens is solidly-built for the streets. It's not too small to be difficult, and not so large that it obscures the viewfinder too much. The raised bump on the 6 'o clock portion of the focusing ring makes quick focusing, and it's knurled all around the perimeter if you like focusing the conventional way with thumb & index finger. Both methods are easy and quick. If the focusing bump is at 6 'o clock, the lens is focused at 4 feet, by the way.Aperture goes from f/2.8 to f/22, and each stop is separated in thirds! How nice is that? This is a fantastic lens. I've been using it without a lens hood, and I have not encountered problems with flare."
5,Excellent Value,The replacement battery works well in my Panasonic Phone. Great vendor in terms of speedy delivery and price.
1,THESE BATTERIES TOTALLY SUCK! DO NOT BUY THEM!,The product was shipped and delivered as advertised. HOWEVER...I bought two of these batteries for two different phones and they worked fine for about three months and then THEY TOTALLY SUCKED. DO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT EVER BUY A NON-OEM BRAND OF BATTERY FOR YOUR WIRELESS PHONES. THESE BATTERIES TOTALLY SUCKED. THREE MONTHS. THREE MONTHS. THEN GARBAGE.
5,Great wedding songs,I never knew this songbook existed. I had the tape since 1981 and loved it from the start. Now I got a digital trasfer of a clean LP and in addition I got the songbook which I plan to use to enhance the midi files I prepared a while ago.
5,I love these things!!!1,I tried these things when I lived on the West coast. Ended up moving away and on the East coast there isnt a whole lot of good asian grocery shops that carry these. Now I just buy them by the case and life is great!
5,The Waterproof Coach:The Waterproof Workout Book for Fitness,"I loved this book! As a new swimmer, it was very helpful, especially the section where the author describes terms used in swimming. My swimming partner, a seasoned swimmer, loved the book so much that she immediately ordered a copy. We shared the book between two lanes and were able to flip back from the basic workout (for me) to a more advanced workout for her. During our first workout I accidentally dropped the book in the water. I dried it off and it is as good as new."
2,Not great for seasoned swimmers.,"This book assumes that the user knows very little about swimming. The layout is wonderful and the concept is clever, but the workouts are not challenging and not too creative. For example, one of the WDs is ""100 swim, 100 kick"". I bought the book to avoid such lackluster sets. So, if you are new to the sport this is a great book. If you swam in HS or college, I'd skip it and look elsewhere."
2,Not sure about this charger,"Our Truecharge 20+ came with our boat which we've had for about 6 years, so we don't know how old the charger is. It is a three bank charger and we have three batteries. One battery (#2) has a history of being overcharged the last couple of years and had to be replaced. The replacement battery is experiencing the same problems with cells being completely boiled out in as little time as one day. The charger face has one amp meter and one charge state indicator. It would seem that a three bank charger would have three of each, one set for each battery bank. If that makes sense, then this unit isn't a true three bank charger with individual sensors for each bank/battery. If I have to replace this charger, I want to be sure that the replacement separately monitors each battery bank. I don't think this one does."
1,The worst purchase I ever made!,"We purchased the Xantrex truecharge 40 amp for our sailboat. After having it for approximately 3 years and using it only a few times, we charged two batteries and the thing burned up. Our 33' sailboat could have easily burned down! We contacted Xantrex and they put us on hold for so long that I hung up and emailed them. It took them about 2 weeks to respond. Basically they said it was out of warranty but they would replace it at a 40% discount. Not good enough. We went to the Annapolis boat show recently and my husband had the battery charger dangling outside of his backpack with ""Lemon"" written on it, right below the burn markings. Numerous people came up to us and said they had similar experiences. We decided we'd cut our losses ($460.00 new) and even if they GAVE us another one, we wouldn't take it - our boat is worth a lot more than that!"
4,"Good, but could be improved","This modem works as advertised, however, with some shortcomings. The modem could follow more of the V.92 standard including allowing phone calls through while remaining connected. Also, more options should be available. Instead of implementing only the more basic options, allow a more advanced option list. I still like the fact that this modem can be operated remotely, which is why I bought it."
2,Do not get started with this book.,"This book is not good for the beginner. It starts with some intermediate concepts and doesn't explain the basics until Chapter 3. It is really backwards. Also, there are no solutions to the exercises in the book. The website is not useful at all. Their is no one to answer your questions. They have examples on the web with solutions, but they don't match the book. I found this book at best confusing."
3,sams teach yourself java 2 online in web time,"The book is not bad, easy to use for beginners. Some significant errors noted. The online part is if you want more problems or exercises. But the site is always down. I haven't been able to access it for sometime and no one responds when I email any possible SAMS contacts. So discount the web part if you want this book."
3,"Good book,...","I read this book on my local bookstore and I found that it is a good book: full with practical examples, and this is not same with other books on Java2 (as long as I knew).Like usual, before I decide to buy books, I will go to Amazon to read the readers' reviews. At the review section, I read on reader saying that the codes are full of errors, and another reader saying that the online section is not responsive. I did try to have a search on Sams publisher, and surprisedly I found that there is no such a book in their database ... Questions: They discontinued this book because bad online section??? Hence, I need to think twice whether I want to buy this book or not."
4,Educational!,"This book is infused with so much hard science it makes the rest of the book difficult to argue with. It makes a wonderful case for understanding Vodou as a valid and noteworthy religion, rather than a freak of Hollywood. The author makes sure to give history and politics, cultural references and enough background as to help the outsider have a better look INSIDE a rich and vibrant culture, to see how to view Vodou in a whole new light, and with a healthy dose of respect. It offers alternate ideas on some phenomena that remain unexplained in other areas as well. There are some story accounts in it that seem to fantastic to be true, but taken with a grain of salt, I find the rest to be credibly informative. I've given this book as gifts to others, I've enjoyed it so much. I recommend it highly. I am a huge fan of anthropologist Wade Davis and his enthnographies as well as Maya Deren's book, ""Divine Horsemen."" Dr. Crosley's book sits next to them in my library."
4,"Well researched, well stated, well done","This book is well done and well written. An academic glance at Voodoo as a philosophy much more than a the Western approach where its seen as a scary African version of Satanism. This book changed my mind, opened my eyes and was well done all the way around."
1,What a waste of paper,"As a Vodou Houngan I read this book with expectations of it being the usual banter with only a marginal amount of information. What I found was something else entirely. A book that has false information in it and manages to have an author against Vodou. Calling it ""hysterical nonsense"" I believe was the term used. The author stated this near the end of the book. Please!... Unless you know A LOT about Vodou don't read this book. The Tao of Physics or Divine Horsemen are MUCH better alternatives."
5,Technical Review of ASDs & Stebbins,"I have read his book and found it very focused on the technical side of ASDs. The book can be read by technical readers who have ""been there- done that"" as well as new to the field technicals learning what ASD actually does. Mr. Stebbins has written many articles on various technical subjects. I have always found his material a great read."
4,interesting recipes,"I agree with the previous reviewer, but would rate it a little higher. I've had the book for years and just never got into using it until recently (with the economy, beans are looking pretty good). Some of the recipes are pretty bizarre and not very appealing, but others are really delicious. The main tip is to feel free to substitute a more common bean, adjust the recipe to accommodate canned beans if you want, and you'll find some interesting and tasty new ways to prepare beans. Pick it up used for almost nothing."
3,Not really what I was looking for,"The book is well written and has good information about beans in general, but I was looking for a book with a lot of good recipes for bean stews, baked beans, bean soups, etc. It did have a number of recipes, but they were a bit odd and not really the type I wanted. They did look very healthful, though."
1,What orchestra? Synthesized sounds!,"Although this CD claims to have been recorded by the Hollywood Studio Orchestra, I do not hear any actual musicians in this recording. All the tracks on this CD are MIDI files or some other computerized sounds. The producers of this CD are slandering the fine studio musicians in Hollywood to label these recordings as the product of ""the Hollywood studio orchestra."" Buy instead almost any other recording of national anthems out there. The two volumes of national anthems performed by the Coldstream Guards are a fine alternative."
3,good enough,"the recording itself is kind of weak - heavy on the string section. otherwise a good way to hear other country's anthems, although that may soon be against the law if asscroft has his way."
1,"Poorly written, Bland",This was a waste of time to watch. It is a poorly written and poorly made movie. The poor lighting andother effects in the movie make it not worth the time.
2,teasing gay fantasy,Never have I seen so many gay short stories performed w/o any hint of sex and hardly any kissing. Pure fantasy.
5,A Proper Examination and Explanation of Human Action,"If you have found most personality tests insignificant, unhelpful, or unrevealing, then perhaps this book is for you. Human Dynamics goes into much more depth and provides a greater understanding of human communication and actions than any simple personality test. While people can be placed into certain ""dynamics,"" these dynamics are not nearly as restraining or stereotypical as personality tests tend to be. Rather than explaining one's personality, dynamics explain how groups of people tend to process information, not necessarily how aggressive, passive, or ""likeable"" they are. This book helped me in terms of personal discovery, and has also helped me understand why it always seemed that so many people ""just never seemed to think like me."""
3,Brief and light,"This is a very ""lite"" read. There are some solid points, some interesting nuggets of information, and some patently obvious observations. Summary - read the fine print. I had hoped for something eye opening, but there was nothing there. Certainly inoffensive, but nothing new. Responding to the 14 year old revewer below, I agree, all 14 year olds should read this book."
2,A poor survey,"Readers looking for an introduction to Mexico should look elsewhere. The author's decision to emphasize a thematic rather than chronological approach was probably the correct one, but the book's brevity prevents him from developing his themes adequately. At the same time, the narrative of Mexican history collapses in confusion. The book is also sloppily written."
2,Not very clear ...,"This book was very hard to read. It jumps from one event to another without respecting the dates. It was very difficult for me to follow the developement of the different events since it doesn't respect a timeline. The different regimes of the varying political leaders (from emperors and dictators to presidents) are not described in a clear/easy way. In my opinion, the author dedicates very little time to describe very important events such as the independence or the revolution. At the end, I just got a general idea of the history of Mexico but not a very clear one. I wouldn't recomend this book to any person interested in the history of Mexico. I gave it two stars only because I think the pictures in the book are quite good and relevant to the description of events."
1,Not concise enough history,"This book is one of those histories that expect you to know a lot of history already. I was very disappointed. I wanted a concise, clear account of Mexico's history. This reads likes someone's thesis. I slogged through to 1900, then skimmed the rest. As a basic history, this is a flop."
2,My mistake I suppose,"Yes, I should have read the publisher's review properly... This book is for low-medium level students of English, and offers some useful angles for learning. However, in my opinion it is of little help for people who have to DO business across cultures. If the reader is struggling with English to the extent that they would find this book relevant to their needs, then they are likely to be out of a job if using that language in the workplace.As an ESL text it may have uses in the hands of a good teacher (because the material is superficial). If your or your students actually need to LEARN something about doing business outside your home country, look elsewhere."
3,Not too bad,"I got this CD for the ""Shiny Disco Balls"" song, and pretty much, that's the only good song on it. Other songs are ok, but just not as happening as Shiny Disco, Disco, Disco =)"
2,Too much pain,"I felt the 2 main characters did too many hurtful things to each other to even consider getting back together at the end. I don't think I would forgive Flame if I were Chance. She was delibertly hurtful and untrusting, considering she didn't even know the old lady. I was disappointed and didn't have a good feeling at the end of the book."
1,Do not be fooled by a lower price,"I was warned about these valves. The operation is so simple that I could not fathom why they would fail. My initial 8 zone system took 11 valves to cobble 8 valves that would not leak. Three weeks into use, and i decide to check my valve boxes, I am glad I did 2 valves leaking. I have now replaced all 8 valves with Toro and could not be more pleased. Buy good valves, you won't be sorry. The time, and money I have wasted on crappy Orbit valves is time and money I will never get back."
4,Bread for the hungry,"'Love is always seventeen' really touched my heart. I've been waiting for a long time for new material from David Gates, as he's been one of my favorite composers/songwriters since the early seventies. Although you may miss the freshness and creativity of his former song arrangements on this album (like you will find on the outrageous album 'First' from 1973), you will hardly find more essential songs like 'Love is always seventeen' or 'I don't wanna share your love' on other todays albums. Most of all I was impressed by the last song on the CD: with 'Thankin' You Sweet Baby James' Gates gives tribute to another great composer of his generation. Now we're waiting impatiently for the new album. David, you're like good red wine: getting older means getting more interesting."
5,christmas present,I got this for my daughter who is very into this sort of thing for christmas it was a hit and it has kept her very busy. This is not something they will be finished with quickly it has taken her quite awhile even with her sisters help to get the quartz out.
2,"Reassuring, but...","While a nice idea, what I didn't realize was this module won't load my Palm AFTER a hard reset. I still needed to hot synch to load the MemorySafe ""drivers"" before the Palm and the module will exchange data.I think it was a waste of money."
1,Amazingly poor quality,"I purchased these boots for my 5 year old daughter about 3 months ago, and we have riding lessons once a week and ride occasionally otherwise. All of the equileather has rubbed off the toes almost back to the toe seam, and the sole has separated from the uppers all the way back for about three inches on one and about an inch on the other. Yes, she is rough on shoes, but we've NEVER had a pair actually fall apart like this (I could have lived with very scuffed toes)."
5,Great riding boot,"Both my daughter and I love this boot, especially for the price. They are flexible and comfortable, have enough of a heel to work well in the saddle, and clean up very easy for the times you need to look sharp. She wears them as both a paddock boot for feeding and mucking and as a riding boot, and we're happy with them for both."
3,returned,"I ordered a youth size 5, they were too small, we returned them. The next size seemed to be adult sizes and these boots didn't come in adult size."
2,Looks way better in the photo.,"I'm hoping that this boot is as rugged and wears as well as the other reviewers say, because it sure is disappointing-looking. Really looks like a plastic boot. Also feels like a plastic boot when walking--there is no give in the material."
2,not great,"This boot is cheaply made. It cost enough for it to be a real leather boot, that's actually what I was expecting. But it's man-made material. Not what I expected for the price"
5,Favorite tool in my collection,"I have many high quality brushes and grooming tools in my collection but this is my ""go to"" tool and all time favorite. It's gentle on the skin and effective at getting through my Collie's thick coat. It's great for removing loose undercoat, massaging the skin and removing tangles. The best part is that he loves it and is very comfortable when I groom him with this. I have a whole bucket full of high dollar brushes and combs but I always end up reaching for this one. It was worth every penny and I wish I had found this one first."
4,Good brief audio book,My daughter loves this movie. The mix of the narration and actual dialog from the movie really makes you picture it all in your head. Hopefully now that she is beginning to read she might be able to read along instead of just listening.
3,good,"I have found that it is a reliable thumbdrive. and it did go through the was and cam out perfectly fine.my problem with this drive is the cap. not only does the key ring break easily, and the cap lose easily.. i found it rather silly to put the key ring on the cap. if the drive falls out of the cap you have the cap, i would much rather loose the cap then the drive.its a good deal for the price."
2,drive works fine but cap broke too soon,"One of the reasons I chose the Memorex over some other options (like the comparably priced SanDisk for example) was because I wanted to put it on my keychain rather than risk losing it or having to put it around my neck. I've had the drive less than three weeks and the cap is already broken-- it came right off my keychain. I didn't abuse it or toss it around or step on it or doing anything extraordinary. And it's less than 3 weeks. Very annoying.The drive itself I haven't had problems with, though."
4,The Only Thumb Drive with a Useful Write Protect Switch,"This is the only USB flash drive I have seen with a useful write protect switch. The switches on other drives are too small. One even requires a pen point or the end of a paper clip to operate it.It's very useful for encrypted password files, when you want to be certain nothing gets added to your drive."
2,It was great until it stopped working properly,"I've owned this flash drive for about a year now and it worked great until about 3 weeks ago. Then for some reason it wasn't recognized by my computer. At first I thought it was a problem with the computer, but when I tried my sister's flash drive, everything was fine. I tried it again on another computer, same story. Frustrated, I forced it in and voila! the computer recognized it. I shook my head in disbelief. The only way a computer would recognize it was if I forced it in? And it wasn't as if I had abused it; I hadrarely used it except for transferring work to different computers. Now I don't bother using it unless I absolutely have to because in order for a computer to recognize it I have to force - and hold - it upwards in the USB slot. If I let go, the drive disappears. It gets very annoying. I haven't had any problems with the cap, just its being recognized. I'm going to look into buying another flash drive."
1,Not my style?,"I like a variety of animes, but this just isn't one of them. I couldn't even get past the first episode. First of all, I always watch in Japanese with subtitles, as I prefer original format, so I can't speak for the dubbed version, if there was one on there. I found the story to be convoluted, the artwork to be shabby in comparison to other loved animes, and the characters not at all compelling or people I could become attached to (a critical hook for me). I honestly didn't care if any or all of them died. But, I'm also not a horror fan (except Resident Evil), and don't like action scenes that are violent for the sake of violence without tasteful combat, which is all I could figure out that this anime offered. I prefer animes like Witch Hunter Robin, or Trigun, so perhaps this is a genre more reserved for people with different tastes than my own."
3,Needs Updating for XP,"Great program if you're still on Win95 or 98 (don't know about ME), but _don't_ try to install under XP. The install program wants to replace system DLLs (mostly related to ODBC) with much older versions. You don't want to do this.If you do want to play with this and see what XP's Windows File Protection does, be sure to set a System Restore Point before you try the install. (If most of the above is Greek to you, then just _don't_.)"
2,North American Birds,This was probably fantastic in it's day. It was written for Windows 95/98 and is entirely incompatible with Windows XP.
5,Works with Win 2000!,"I have used this program for years (Ver 1.1) and it has worked on every system I've tried.I HAVE NOT tried it on XP, but I would believe it should work there also.No longer produced, but an excellent Birding program!"
4,Cute!!,This play dish set was very cute my son loved them:) Only problem was one of the forks came defective but other than that great!!
2,so small!,i bought these along with a play kitchen and play food but they are so small that they dont even fit the play fried egg! so much smaller than i thought they would be. ive just been giving her regular plastic plates that she eats off of instead. the largest plate is about the size of a regular saucer or even smaller. wasnt too happy with this.
5,absolute must for all those considering santa clara.......,A great insider to the university. All truth no hoax. Much better than princeton review. buy now!!!
2,"Doesn't really qualify as a ""greatest hits"" album","I empathize with the AON fans who once owned the illustrious ""blue cover"" version of this title. I'm fortunate enough to still have my copy which, to set the record straight, is basically the 12"" mixes of most of the titles on this release. It is true that removing ""Moments In Love"" from this album is a crime, but I also believe that the original version of ""Legs"" was a much better single for Art Of Noise than its evil twin, ""Legacy"". Finally, I have never been able to locate a CD with the original version of ""Beat Box"" (the version on the Into Battle ep). Even the Daft CD, which compiles Into Battle, the Moments In Love ep, and (Who's Afraid Of?) The Art Of Noise! left this version out, which should have also been included on this compilation of their 7"" singles. Keep your eyes open for the hard-to-find ""blue cover"" version."
3,Not what I remembered..,"I was thinking the other day of how much I used to love the Art of Noise, yet most of what I ever had of them were now very dirty or lost old cassettes. So, I bought this hoping to revive my love for Art of Noise. I was pretty disappointed with this cd, it was not at all what I remembered. The songs on here are some of the greatest hits but it seems like they've been remixed or modernized somehow. Its just not the way I remember it. Maybe I'll try this blue cover version."
3,This is a remix of the discontinued original version,"The original 'Best of' contained ""Moments in Love"" on the third track. It is an incredible piece that had been used in a lot of movies and media, and they took it off the current version with the same title. It is the only source I can find of 'Moments' with the incredible synth solo. I would love to get my hands on an original release of ""Best of Art of Noise""!!! I just can't believe they took it off when they re-released it."
3,blue version is better,"I have the blue CD version and did not know what I had until I heard other versions of Art of Noise.The blue version is much better.Since it's out of production, I'm willing to tape it for anyone that wants a copy.One thing is, the cd skips twice on""Moments in love."" I think I would die if something happens to this copy. I've had it for years now. You can reach me at johnammons@webtv.net"
3,they had some banging grooves,they had some banging grooves and what have you but were mainly an 80's thing.it would be good if not for that horrible version of Kiss.that was a bad joke.still some great moments.
1,Best of Art of Noise,"Of all of the songs they have composed, I think their best should of been of better songs."
2,Deceptive,"I was quite dismayed to find this was not the same mix as the now sought after ""blue cover"". Shame on the producers for not renaming the complilation (volume 2), and not changing the artwork."
3,Good CD,"I got this version and the original blue version that actually best mixes of Art Of Noise. The original is still the best. From the seductive ""Moments in Love"" to punchy ""Legacy"". Sadly a greatest Hits CD without it Best Songs. Else I would have given Cd a Five Star. Plus I be buying more of the orignal for my friends who love the CD for their collection."
2,bad mastering,"This CD contains some of the best of The Art of Noise but the mastering is awful. On Paranomia which fetures Max Headroom the mastering is so bad that his voice is barely audible. Why no Beatbox on this CD? All in all 5 stars for the great songs but 1 star for the mastering. Don't buy this CD, get the songs on their other CD's."
3,"I had both versions of this cd, and the blue is much better.","I love the mixes on the blue version of this cd. It had all the best songs all on one cd. My blue cover version was stolen. I've been looking for it everywhere. If you have it, keep it. It's a great collection of songs and very hard to replace once gone."
4,"Good visual/sounding quality, but hard to play plus...",plus good story line!But...besides that I think this game is difficult to play even though i reccomend it to any star wars gamer!!!:)
2,Another Step Forward,"This album is sign of the bands growth and maturity. The tracks are rife with slamming guitar riffs, hitting melodies, and thoughtfully intense lyrics. Tracks like ""This Is A Love Song... For The Loveless"" ""Shotgun Serenade"" and ""My Heart Is A Soldier"" are a difinite growth from their previous albums, while ""French Kiss Off"" gives light to the bands more aggresive side. They've tapped into their riviting live sound and poured it onto record. This may be the crossover the band definately deserves, and if you are a long time Juliana Theory listener, or a casual observer, you don't want to miss Deadbeat Sweetheartbeat."
5,AMAZING ALBUM,"This album is their best by far, although their others are all worth getting as well. The first song, This is a Lovesong... For the Loveless caught my attention right away, i constantly listen to it and it's just a catchy song. We Make The Road by Walking, Shotgun Serenade, and My Heart is a Soldier are all catchy songs too and I really like them. The Final Song (not actually the last song on the cd) is a truly amazing song, I love it. And, the last song, French Kiss-Off, woah, that is the most headbanger rock song on this album and it's great.If you're a Juliana Theory fan, definitely get this album, you won't regret it, and to new TJT listeners, even if you don't like their older material, get this album too, it's less poppy, more of a rock album, their best cd yet, in my opinion."
5,It does not get any better,"This is one of my favorite albums, and it honestly gets better the more I listen to it. Even though it has a few years on it, it is more fresh and relevant than most of the ""chanting/marching"" crap out these days."
5,The Juliana Theory impresses again...,"I've been a fan of The Juliana Theory since the day ""Emotion is Dead"" came out (and I bought the only copy my local Best Buy got shipped to them).Although their last album ""Love"" seemed to be a bit of a departure from their normal style, this album successfully combines their earlier 'hooky' songrwriting with Love's rock power.The standout tracks for me are the third song and the seventh. I listen to them over and over and haven't gotten tired of them yet.If you like Emo, you'll like this."
4,Wahl personal trimmer,"Very plasticy and light, but gets the job done. Has been doing fine work up in the forest that is my nose hair. Very powerful and the optional blades/tools are nice as well. Feels cheap, but so far so good."
1,Terrible Trimmer,"This product is for me a very poor quality. Wahl fail with this article.The engine is very bad. If you turn on it only moves fast, but if you put an accessory, this gets slow and pull your nose hairs.If you are using carbon batteries is impossible to use, and alkaline batteries the works a little better. I think this engine is high power consumption."
5,Great personal trimmer,It works very well and I use it all the time. In fact it works so well that my son loves it so I am ordering another one for him as a birthday present.
3,wahl personal trimmer,"Works ok trimming nose hair. Accessories included with trimmer would not work at all, were trash-canned. Battery case opens too easily when turned on. I likely will opt for a higher end purchase next time."
3,"OK, but not great","This product works ok on nose, ears and eyebrows. The attachments won't do much else very well (such as neck hair). My biggest disappointment is with the battery cover. It simply will not stay on. It would be an easy fix by the manufacturer, but this product is clearly manufactured as cheaply as possible. The trimmer feels very cheap and light which makes me question its long-term durability. Other inexpensive trimmers like this received mediocre reviews as well, so I bought this based on one review and the reputation of the Wahl name brand. It seems to work fine for limited purposes but the battery cover and cheap design keep me from giving an enthusiastic endorsement."
3,A GREAT NO PAIN TRIMMER,"Would you like a trimmer which doesn't occasionally yank a hair out? I don't know about anyone else' experience with Wahl trimmers, but mine has been excellent. Nose hair, ear hair trimmed painlessly away.The attachments work ok, but are not the best in the world, Still, I'd rather take more time to trim my hair painlessly than to use another brand which have attachments that do it faster but cause pain."
3,Cordless Personal Trimmer,I bought this as a gift....what does a wife know.. it is a quality product however it was too wide for trimming his mustache easily.. so he doesn't use it for that now trims the hairline with it.
3,Book For Class,"This book was for my political science class. Though it was better than most other books on history it was still pretty dry. I found it hard to read more than one chapter at a time, but it could have been worse. I enjoy reading on history but this book wasn't for me."
2,Corn Syrup,"I bought 6 bottles, and I doubt I'll ever finish these. The flavor is too sweet and processed. I think the lesson is to avoid corn syrup in sauces ('cept Ketchup)."
4,look alike,"I bought this puppet from Amazon and I was happy to see that this lady looks exactly like the one in the book. Although, it's a shame that her tummy is not big enough to swallow all that stuff."
3,The Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly Puppet,The old lady also swallowed a goat. The goat was missing - not included! I had to convince my three year old grandaughter that maybe she didn't swallow a goat.
2,Not a good replacement part..,"We bought this generic and thought that it might work for our old car. Well, it did not fit well...we still was ok with it, but then it went bad in like few months. It was a waste of money for us and would not recommend it to anyone...."
3,Down Scope ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This is a fascinating modern submarine history book but it is a little too techie for me. After the first few chapters of in depth, detail descriptions of every type of sonar, radar and radio system known to man, I kind of nodded off. However, having spent a few years on the Regulas boats out of Pearl Harbor in the mid sixties I found the book enlightening and am glad I bought it. If you want to know a great deal about modern submarine design and development buy this book. If you enjoy reading about submariners and their activities read Blind Man's Bluff."
4,Vater 2S,Great feeling stick if you are tired of your hands feeling all the shock of hard hitting. If you're moving up in size from a 1A or something-take this route. If you're now using 5B or something smaller-this will feel like a tree trunk. Makes me feel like a champion of the sun when I hold them. If you don't like them-don't hesitate to try the Vic Firth MS4. But-broke after 4 days of use. MS4 is way more durable...by a long shot.
3,Prevention Issues For Womens Health In The New Millennium,"Evaluates the effectiveness of cancer education program for women attending rural public health departments and the performance of breast self-examination. Discusses the influence of sexual orientation on health behaviors in women and reduction of co-occurring distress and HIV risk behaviors among women substance abusers. Contains sections on American- Indian women and health, and, how the perception of health status influences participation in present and future health promotion behaviors among African-American women."
4,"A magic show, if you don't mind the commercials!!!","From the Magic tour, how could this concert go wrong?? With all the stock footage and faded soundtrack in between. I'm glad there's only four members in Queen so we didn't have to go through that FIVE TIMES!!!I await the DVD release, as they are letting the whole show run. This show was obviously one of the pinnacles in Queen's career, and should be treated as such."
2,cute but cheap,"I loved the ring on the picture. It was so colorful and catchy. But when I received it, the stones were nothing like the one thats on the photo :( they were more glass-like... I still liked the fact that it was sterling silver and flower shaped. It was very disappointing that one of the stones fell of the ring after 2 month :( seems like cheap manufacturing."
1,Was shipped something not what I ordered,"I ordered this product from christophor26, and it was not what is pictured here. It lacks the cap and the key ring, which is the only reason I bought this drive. Do not buy from christophor26."
3,drive is fine but cap is not,"The drive works fine, and its slim profile is particularly useful in my notebook computer, where the two USB ports are very close together. I have never had difficulty with corrupted files or copying.The cap, however, is dismayingly flimsy: it broke with very light use. I am now holding the cap on the drive with a rubber band -- and am quite frustrated by the inability to find a way to get a replacement cap. The Lexar web site offers an inexpensive package of replacement caps for its thumb drives -- why should not Memorex do the same?If only I had an easy way to get replacement caps, I would rate this tool higher."
1,Product as designed is defective,"This drive has a plastic cap with keychain loop which quickly wears and breaks through when used on a metallic keychain. Memorex will replace the cap, but it will only break again. Memorex support told me that my problem was that I was using it on a metal keychain and told me they would send me a lanyard to use with the device. However, I noted that the product packaging itself shows the drive being used on a metal keychain! Memorex now has a ""New"" travelDrive with a metal keychain loop. If you want a Memorex drive, buy that one, NOT this one!"
5,a classic workbook,"Very heavy, very complete, and very easy to follow especially if you are familiar with the now old fashioned editing benchJust getting used with the panels and it grows on you as if you never did anything elseComplete the exercises a few times and you get the hang of itVery Good"
5,Top Notch book,"I have spent a lot of time checking out books from the library on Final Cut, but often disliked the organization of the books. The manual for FCP certification is great, and teaches you little tips that I haven't seen anywhere else. The author gets right to the work you need to do for editing. The writing style is clear and concise, with no fluff as you'll find in a lot of the training books with the conversational tones. Although I've edited on Final Cut before, I found this book to have something new to learn in each chapter. Another excellent aspect of the book is that it builds upon the knowledge you have learnt in the previous lessons. I wish the author could have spent more time on exporting to web. Still, highly recommended."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I was very disappointed in the quality of this charm. It looks like it came in a bubble gum machine!
5,Fun Gift for Your Boss,"Instead of the standard holiday gift our CEO receives(think wine & food products), I decided to do something small yet fun. He loved it so much he immediately e-mailed me to thank me for a such a creative, fun gift. He's been gonging away ever since. :)"
3,SUPER small :(,"I guess I should have paid more attention to the product description before purchasing, so this is kind of my fault and not the seller's, but please be aware that this gong is VERY small. They weren't kidding when they said mini. I want to say that the gong itself is probably only about 3 inches or so in diameter. It also has a tinny, bellish ring rather than the deep ""gong"" sound you're probably looking for. It's still fun for kicks at work, but I'm probably going to look for a much bigger one. Unfortunately, even on Amazon, it looks like that's going to be a much larger investment since at least this one was pretty cheap."
3,More like a *ting* than a gong,"This item made for a low-priced office gag. However, the sound it makes I would describe more as ""ting"" than ""gong""."
3,Gonged the Gong,"I ordered this for a desk hoping that it would be fun to gong every now and then. It is cute and the booklet has a few interesting things in it ,but in my opinion, it is not very usable so if you just wanted a baby gong to look at, then this is perfect for you. If you were looking to gong a coworker-not so much for you."
4,Cute Novelty Item,"My daughter and I bought the Executive Desk Gong as a thank you gift for her teachers. All of the teachers loved the little gongs. These are not ""real"" gongs in the sense that they have no real timbre, but they make for good decoration. The booklet that comes with the product got more than a few chuckles. All in all, a cute novelty gift and decoration. Not for the serious collector, but at this price, were you really expecting that?"
3,Missing Parts,hi thereI have recieved the gong but it was incomplete the gonger was missingthe postal pack had not been opened but the contents I found to be unpacked and the Gonger was missing Please dispatch a new gonger as showen in picture of contentsThanks Dave Allen
3,Below average,The blade didn't even sit well on the straight edge razor due to uneven proportions. I was actually scared to use it on myself.
3,Nice Looking But Poor Performer,"This is an attractive well made slide in razor, but it doesn't support the blade well. This razor leaves about 2mm - 3mm of unsupported blade sticking out which means the blade has too much flex and chatter when shaving which results in unnecessary nicks and cuts. I would recommend the Parker razors instead. They support the blade very firmly up to about 1mm from the blade edge. This results in a very smooth nick free shave. The Parker SR! and SRW perform much better than these Personna Magics."
4,Just as Described,Works like a champ! Its actually higher quality than what it looks like in the pictures. Would buy it again.
3,ehhhh!,Not great not bad just ehhh! The razor is not bad but if you want something to last a long time look elsewhere.
2,Doesn't come with razors,"I thought my son in the military might enjoy this. The description doesn't seem to mention that the razors are not even included with this razor. I understand it does state which razors it uses, but I expected at least one or two to be included with it. This was therefore not usable without a trip to go buy razors. I feel like it would have been worthwhile to be informed of this so I could have ordered a few razors for him."
3,The Jet Set,"Ok I bought this for the Taylor/Burton connection for my wife hadn't seen this movie, soI purchased it more for her than myself.Lots of big name actors/actress abound, as this star-cast tries to move onto to Americafor whatever fate awaits them. From leaving their husband, to a business deal gone wrong orto make money to keep up on their estate back home.But bad weather delays everything and causes sub-plots to develop into a soap opera typeatmosphere. Taylor always looks beautiful in anything she wears and Burton the handsomeguilden husband trying to win her back from the broken playboy about to sweep her away.It's a nice movie to watch some raining afternoon with a fire and a glass of wine."
3,"DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA","If you want over done drama, this is the one for you!!! Loved it! Would watch it again.... Liz look fabulous of course.."
3,one of those oldtime all-star fests we no longer see (praise frith!),"richard burton & elizabeth taylor (at the height of ""cleomania"") are the purported stars of this movie (they dont make them like this any more!) but it is really worth seeing for the tour-de-force of margaret rutherford, who won a richly deserved oscar as a now-poverty-stricken duchess trying to make ends meet. hardly a top movie, but if you want to see something to waste an evening, go for it."
5,Lawson's Final Call is a must read by the church today.,"This book found a permanent place in my library. His insight on the first three chapters of Revelation was gripping and powerful. If you read only one other book than the Bible this year, let it be Final Call. I wasn't content to read it and leave it, however. I've used the material to teach three different classes. Lawson knows God's word and communicates it clearly."
1,buyer beware,I have read many accounts of the second disc of each movie not working. It has been the same for us. I do not recommend buying this version. Maybe buying the newly released blu ray extended versions individually will leave you better off.
5,I got this for $42 with free shipping...NEW!!!,"Im a huge LOTR fan love the movies.Only complaint is that every movie is spilt into two disks.I hardly write reviews and I buy alot of items from amazon. I just felt I should let people know that I bought this for $42 and got free shipping with amazon's $25 and over offer. I see now its $72 Iv seen this before. I say wait a little if you want this boxset but don't wanna pay that price wait a bit, it should go down soon again hopfully for all future buyers."
4,Is this worth it?,"The movies are fine. Quality as good as one can expect, though Fellowship is certainly not as sharp as one would expect from Bluray. However, I also paid for digital copies of these three movies as part of the package, and I CAN'T get them!! Anytime I try I am told that wbdigitalcopy.com is being 'reset' I've been trying for two days and can't get the digital copies I paid for.Why in the HELL can't these digital copies be included on the disks?? This is BLURAY!! There's plenty of room. Why make us do this insane song and dance with a website that can't manage to stay up long enough to provide customers with the items they paid for??"
5,A beautiful masterpiece!,"Peter Jackson's motion picture trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, is one of remarkable vision and artistic exploration. While staying true to J.R.R Tolkien's novels (as best as Hollywood can) Jackson was able to spin the series into his version of the story and surprise, as well as delight all of its viewers. I have always enjoyed the series, and to be honest I was a little worried when I heard they were going to be making it into 3 motion pictures because I know what Hollywood does to films. I am glad to report that he has blown my expectations out of the water and created a true fan of his work. His casting was filled with excellent choices, and now I cannot imagine better people to play those parts. They all so obviously enjoyed their work, and made it believable in their own way. I cannot wait to see what he is going to do with the Hobbit, because if this series is anything to base it on, it will be a masterpiece from start to finish!"
2,"Excellent movies, disappointing extras","PROS:Extended versions of the theatrical releases provided very useful background information. Fantastic audio and visual transfer.CONS:Each movie requires 2 discs. This is understandable given the additional footage, but was slightly irritating. The bonus discs are all region coded, despite the product claiming to be ""region free"". No good on my Australian DVD players (PS3 and Panasonic Blu Ray player).VERDICT:Those wanting to see the extended movie versions will be in for a treat. Those wanting to see the extras on B/2 region players will be disappointed. Would have been value for money had the set worked as claimed."
2,"One Version, Not Both","I'm going to counter the band wagon bunch with a low review simply because I'm disappointed the studio is still issuing separate releases for these films. I'm very much in agreement the long version is truest to the original vision, but I'd also like to see the theatrical version from time-to-time when three hours is all I have. The studio is obviously being greedy releasing each version independently, when blu technology can quite seemlessly include both on the same disk. Of the two, I'll buy this one, but I will not pay twice for tracks I already own."
1,Ripoff! Cancelling pre-order,"I was so excited when I first heard about the EE getting the BD treatment. All I can say I feel now is let down. You can flap your av club dork jaw all day about bit rates and compression and dvds and SD/HD extras. The point is many of us wanted to see the films in HD on one seemless disc. Guess what, I DON'T want to change discs! I don't care about special features or extras one bit. I watch films for themselves not for pointless extras and special junk that everyone gets hung up on. Who is sitting around saying to themselves ""Man, I sure wish I could watch that documentary about how they make hobbit feet in 1080P!"".I only want the EE's on one disc, no extras, no theatrical cut, no documentaries or commentaries. PERIOD. It CAN be done and in all likelihood will. I am cancelling my pre-order and will just stick with the dvd EE's until the bare bones comes out or a better edition after the Hobbit."
1,LOTR Extended Edition Blu ray still on 2 discs??????,"The only reason I bought these HD versions was to get EACH movie on ONE disc! Even with the capacity of blue ray, how can the movies not fit on one disc per movie??? I already own all the other versions of this movie. I would have never bought this set to get the same stuff in a little better quality. Very disappointed!"
1,Another money con,"I think that as long as people buy these products for the overly priced Blu-Ray's or DVD's the studios wil keep pumping them out. They are there to make MONEY, nothing else. If the movie watching public stops buying maybe they will listen, but that won't happen. You cannot get ten people in a room to agree to one thing let alone a whole movie watching country. I would love to own these extended editions, but refuse to pay for all the extra discs I will NEVER use, including the digital copy."
5,2012 :(,Sad that we have to go through the whole Theatrical release following by the only version that anyone cares about (Extended edition). With that being said.. I went ahead and voted the theatrical version a 1 and this a 5 like most of the fans out there!
5,A must for LOTR Fans,"Great product and remember it IS the extended version which every fan should get.It comes in a great looking box that opens up to a map of middle earth and some other pictures. Inside are three separate Blu ray cases for each movie which is a great addition to top of the cover. The top lining that says Blu ray is only on the wrapping and is discarded after the wrapping is taken off, which might bother those with a similar looking DVD box."
1,We're waiting until when!?!,i agree with everyone else who says it's sad business making us wait for so long.
1,I don't want a set,ROTK extended was a joke. I want to purchase Extended Fellowship and Two Towers on Blu Ray and the theatrical ROTK
1,You Double Dip = I Boycott,"Enough is enough. I hope the Studios are reading these reviews. Shame on you for milking your loyal fans over and over again. Intentionally leaving such a long gap between releasing these Blu ray editions in order to fulfill your greed. Despite how much of a fan I am, I refuse to purchase this item as I want to make up the difference in the double dipping that has gone on. So, not only will I not purchase both, I shall purchase neither. I hope many of you will follow my lead and teach these bloodsuckers a lesson from which we shall benefit in the future."
2,LOTR - my opinion,Bo-ring! Too long! A waste of talented actors! And what's with the underlying homo-erotic theme? I think I'll stick to the Harry Potter movies. At least they are good.
1,Not the theatrical release,This is not the theatrical version. It was too long and boring. when will companies stop playing these games and only release one theatrical release and leave the extras off.
1,Get it at the Flea Market...,"Lord of the Rings is the BEST movie(s) ever made! BUT, I'm not paying this price to watch it over 6 discs when you can do the same thing on the DVD extended version on 3 discs.I'm gonna wait and grab them at one of the local flea markets for 20 bucks.Sorry..."
1,I've have more fun in a movie theater waiting in line for popcorn,"These movies were long and boring and were a waste of time to not only me but also to people that enjoyed them. And I am a professional so my opinion is super accurate and can not be disputed. So there you have it, the gospel if you will."
4,Very nice extended editions on Blu-Ray,"Initially, I was kind of reluctant to purchase these ""old"" movies when the set did not come with all Blu-Ray so I did not think it's worth the money! However, when the price came down to $49.99, I thought I would give it a try. As expected, the movies on these extended versions which are all on Blu-Ray are good with excellent picture and sound quality. No complaint except that I did not watch the other extras which came on DVDs. I tried one DVD but the picture and sound quality were bad when it was played on Blu-Ray player and best TV.In conclusion, if you only want the movies on Blu-Ray, it's good to have this set. But, if you want to watch all (movies + extras), this set would not give you the best!"
5,Amazing kit! Especially since we got it on sale!,"My girlfriend has always been a huge fan of these movies, and I have read all the books, but I have never seen the movies. I figured this would be a great xmas gift for her and it was! Huge box set with an Astronimcal 15 Blu-rays. Looks great on our TV. came with a cool case around all three movies. We sat down and had a movie night every sunday for 3 weeks to get through them. I have now seen them and they were equally great! Worth the buy, especially if you get it for $40.00 like we did!"
5,A classic,As a fan of the original books by Tolkien and having these in my book collection it is only fitting that this should also apply to the epic Peter Jackson filmatisation of these. A must in every classic film collection.
4,The definitive LOTR collection.,"The trilogy looks beautiful in full HD, I really would consider this the definitive collection of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I only wish they had tried to upscale the video quality special features (which are all on DVD's) because the lower quality is very noticeable after viewing one of the films in HD. I also think they could have fit it on fewer then 15 discs if they had put the special features on Blu-Ray's.Besides that I am very satisfied, the trilogy looks very smooth and very sharp in 1080P and doesn't have that ""Mexican Soap Opera"" look many people have complained about with certain Blu-Ray films."
1,Why The Green Tint?,"The extended edition of Fellowship of the Ring on Blu-ray has a green color shift across the entire movie. I believe the studio made an error in mastering this movie. The snow looks teal/green, even the lettering of the title no longer looks as white. This isn't the Matrix and the colors were great to begin with, so why mess it all up? I loaded screenshots into photoshop just to verify the colors had been changed, and sure enough the snow scenes are reading much higher in the green channel as opposed to previous releases of the movie. The other two movies don't suffer from this ""green shift"" so I urge others to complain, not buy, return their copies until WB issues a trade-in for a properly mastered disk!"
1,"Duplicate content & Disc 2 of ""The Return of The King"" missing","I have a problem with ""The Return of The King"", Disc Nr. 2 has the exact same content as Disc Nr. 1. !!!"
3,Very dissapointed,"The third disc set was both part one, there wasnt a part two of the 3rd movie. This couldnt have been the sellers fault, but it was a present and they had to go out of their way to buy a new EXTENDED and BLU RAY lotr movie..but otherwise, it was great. It came quickly."
5,All in one!,"I'm a fan of this movie... get all in one, what else I can ask for? Spectacular box and case: right size, not tight. Everything in order. And content... well: awesome. Good cost benefit, so I think."
5,AWESOME!!,Under $50 bucks for Triolgy was too good to pass on so I had to get get it and it was perfect!!!
5,LOTR Blu-ray,"I loved the theatrical versions of this movie, until I watched the extended editions of the movies. I can no longer watch the original movies after this! I nearly bought the originals in blu-ray but I'm glad I didn't. I couldn't be happier with this extended edition of LOTR."
3,Subtitles,"I had a bad experience with this pack, bought this for Argentina and no has spanish subtitles like you said in the product information I'm very angry with thisThe Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions) [Blu-ray]"
5,Buy this version! It's the real thing!,"I can't wait till this version comes out! I'll be buying it up immediately! To those who don't know...this is the extended version. Much better than the other LOTR Blu-Ray version that's coming out sooner. Add a review for this and sign up to be notified as to when it's released! The more people that do this, the sooner it'll come out."
5,AMAZING,This is such a great collection! The movies are exceptional and the quality is just so great on Blu-Ray! Definitely worth the money and I am so excited to watch them all!
3,could be better,"picture quality and packaging are great, but the volume of the music is to high comparing to voices... (I had to put subtitle on it due to low volume of the voices)"
5,Great upgrade,"I watched this a week before ""The Hobbit"" was released in theaters. What a beautiful film made all the better in hi def!"
4,Everything was ok,The movies came in good condition. Just wished the movie came in one disc and not in two. Its annoying to take out one disc and put the other to continue watching the same movie. This isn't vhs anymore its blu ray disc. come on
2,The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray,The collection is overall ok. My issue is the color format looks forced. Almost fake or too much of it. That's probably because of the digital effects makes it look cheesy. Having that said the collection is ok. I just wonder if another copy of the collection ( revised) might come out this year 2012?
5,Is What It Says It Is,"The picture quality of even the first movie far surpasses the original standard DVD that came out years ago. If one really likes this trilogy, then the extra footage (as long as 30 extra minutes on one film) is a fantastic way to round out the story that is already known so well."
5,The extend trilogy finally on blu ray HD,The extended lotr trilogy bluray edition changes the way we have watched it. Experience the great journey as frodo baggins travels to destroy the one ring that could destroy everything in middle earth.
5,Amazing piece of cinematic beauty,"I have always loved these movies, and getting them on Blu-Ray has just furthered my love of the beauty of this trilogy.It is stunning imagery and adding the definition of Blu-Ray takes it to a whole new level."
4,very nice box,"amazing quality for all parts of the blu ray.there is no any problem with part 1,2,3.4 star becuase no 3d."
4,"Very nice, but there are questions left","It is, if course, great to have the EE on Blu-ray. On the other hand, there are some questions. I am sorry for not having the time to read all comments made so far, therefore I just put the questions here.First, why will this edition be LIMITED? Will the interested customers be forced to pre-order to have a chance to get the LEE?Second, if the bonus material does not come in HD, why do we have to buy it again? I mean, will it be possible to buy the EE on Blu-ray without the extras?Third, what happens when the Hobbit film will be finished? Will there some scenes in the LOTR film be modified, similarly to what we have seen in the Star Wars film? And, consequently, does it make sense to buy the EE on Blu-ray NOW??"
3,The Studio strikes back,"Looks like they heard all the 1 star reviews and finally put out the EEs, with vengeance. The 2nd and 3rd movies look great but just to be jerks (i guess), they added an odd greenness to The Fellowship of the Ring. Some rocks look like they have moss now, and teeth and skies look unnaturally blue. It is not enough to ruin the movie, but it sure does not improve the experience."
2,$83.99 For three BR Discs!,"Even more money to get three BR discs and the same extras on dvd that I already have on DVD. I'll continue to live with up-scaled DVD until these 3 movies drop in price to something under $15! The producers have ripped off the public enough! First the DVD's, then the extended DVD's. Then the theatrical BR's, and now this! Each time, the movies have been over priced!"
5,Amazing.,"Everywhere I looked for this item in stores it was $120. Amazon has it for $50 and I must say, I would pay $50 just for the case the movies came in. It also has 26 hours of bonus footage (15 discs in total) along with the movies being the extended edition versions. Bottom line: If you're a fan of LOTR like myself...this is a MUST BUY!"
5,Worthy of Collection,"I was disappointed the special features were not in blu-ray. The books were fantastic, and the directors brought the creatures of imagination to life. We are a lucky generation to be able to collect blu-ray movies and this collection is worthy of the technology."
4,Check your discs in all 3 jewel boxes - I received wrong discs!,"As other reviewers have noted, it was disappointing to open the product box and see that I had two discs labeled ""Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition Part Two"" but no Part One. I don't know how a major release like this can be bungled. I don't like the hassle of returns, even when it won't cost me anything but time, but I am missing the first disc of the first movie, so I couldn't even enjoy the first film. Just taped the box back up and it's getting ready to be sent back. I can't wait to get the correct discs in my replacement, but I'm worried there is a large number of bungled packages out there, and I don't want to keep returning package after package. Fingers crossed the next box has all 16 of the correct discs. *sigh* Can't wait to truly enjoy what looks like a great set. FYI, I just don't have the heart to give the whole box set one star - I've waited a long time for these blu-rays. Just get me all 16 discs, please."
5,A jewel that can not fail to have,This set is wonderful! So far I've only seen the 6 disc blu ray and they look great. In the extended version there is much information that explains certain scenes in the film version. I have yet to see the 9 DVD's discs. The packaging of this set is gorgeous and really a gem that every fan of the Lord of The Rings saga can not be without. I highly recommend this product.
5,Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blue Ray,"I bought this as a birthday present for my son. It was the cheapest price I found, got free shipping and it arrived in just a few days. He was thrilled when he received it ; )"
5,Completely Worth It!!!!!,I gave this trilogy 5-stars the moment I saw the price! These three have always been one of my favorites movies and I never get tired of seeing them.The extended scenes and the ones that where added are also a huge part of why this set is awesome! 5 CD's in each case with hours and hours of detailed information. Behind the scenes and the stories and background of the important characters and creatures of Middle-Earth.Simply AWESOME!
5,Amazing!,I have already watched the first movie and the picture quality is fantastic. I love all the added scenes they give a little more insight into the plot of the movie I wish they were included all along. And the price of $49.99 is the lowest I have seen!
5,LA MEJOR PELICULA DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS,"PUDE VER QUE LA PRINCIPAL QUEJA SE REFERIA A CIERTA TONALIDAD VERDE EN LAS ESCENAS DE NIEVE Y EN LOS BOSQUES DE LOTHORIEN, SIN EMBARGO YO NO LA VI HASTA QUE ME PUSE AJUGAR CON LA CONFIGURACION DE PANTAALLA DE MI TELEVISOR (UN SONY BRAVIA) Y AL CAMBIAR DEL MODO VIVID AL MODO CINEMA PUDE VER ESTO, LO MOSMO ME PASO CON LOS SAMSUNG LED FULL HD, LA MEJOR TRILOGIA DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS AL ALCANCE DELA MANO Y A UN PRECIO INSUPERABLE"
3,15 Disks...GIVE ME A BREAK!!!,"I've seen the theatrical versions in the movies, the theatrical & extended ""standard"" DVDs and the theartical Blu-Rays at home...they were all great!Now, do I want to have 15 disks, just to be able to see the extended versions on Blu-Ray...not at all.I felt I was ripped having to wait all this time for the extended Blu-Rays.I don't have the time, the desire or the willpower to watch 15 DVDs.I would have loved each extended movie per Blu-Ray DVD, but would take them on two.I guess I just have to wait it out and hope I'm alive by then!"
3,Correction!,"For those who are saying those ""thieves"" could have fit the theatrical and extended on one Blueray disc, you are incorrect. A double layer Blueray disc holds a little more than 9 hours of HD video content. The extended edition is going to have over 11 hours of runtime at least.Do two things. First, check the BD faq to find out how much the discs can hold in hd video content:[...]Second, find the DVD extended version and see what the runtime is in minutes. That will give you an idea of what is possible.However, that being said, I think most fans will be waiting for the extended edition. And unless those ""thieves"" use a triple layer, they will have to do multiple discs."
3,Feeling Strung Along By Newline...,"I soooo want to order this set, but I'm afraid the quality of the Blu Ray transfer will be the same as the theatrical version - which is utter junk. I've got a new blu ray player and a 55"" LED TV and I can see NO difference between the Blu Ray theatrical release and the upscaled standard def DVD version.I have a sneaky suspicion that the ""limited edition"" verbiage printed on this set means a ""New Transfer!!"" edition will be released in 6 more months.I'm going to wait..."
2,Little Improvement over DVD,"I was unhappy with the picture quality of this transfer. I ran the discs on an oppo blu ray into both a dpi m-vision 230 and a jvc dla-x-3 projector onto a 110"" diagonal stewart studio-tek screen. The difference between the 480p dvd and this blu-ray was negligible. I was dissappointed."
5,The Lord of the Rings the way it was meant to be seen,"This collection features the extended editions on Blu-ray, an amazingly good looking and sounding trilogy to rival any other in film. The extended editions add a certain comedy back into the films which was missing when compared to the books. These films feel more like the books, and although they are a combined 12+ hours, I was captivated for the entirety of each film. In my opinion this is the only way to watch the films if you've read the books."
5,LOTR Box Set,"This was a Christmas gift this year, and I absolutely love it. The extended scenes are done just as well as the movie is, so its not noticeable at all when you are watching an extended scene. One thing that gets the biggest complaint about this set is that the movies are each on 2 discs, well true but, I think its great that they are on 2 discs because quite frankly they are VERY long movies and Its almost like an intermission, I enjoy the break between movies, and they do it at a very good time (ex) it doesn't cut off in the middle of a big battle or something."
3,Plan to wait till The Hobbitt comes out (2011 or 2012)? Will Blu even be available then?,"Rating is not of the films (those I would give 5 stars) - my rating applies only to the release of the theatrical versions which are inferior to the extended IF you are a true fan of the series.I read somewhere (maybe [...])? that more than likely, the Extended Edition Blu of the Trilogy will likely not come out until the Hobbitt films are ready to be released for purchase - I heard that they will likely do one huge extended 'pentology release' of all 5 films - likely in an extended format as well.Given that this wait is at least 3-4 years off, I don't plan on purchasing the Theatrical release.If you need a fix in the meantime - try reading all the books (Trilogy, Hobbitt, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, and the like."
5,One trilogy to rule them all.,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. Not only is the quality in both sound and image superb, but the box and the Blu-Ray cases are amazing! Seriously! Every time I open this box set and open one of the BR cases, it's like I'm opening a piece of heaven!"
3,My Disc 2 will not play!,"Maybe it's my blu-ray player (I have a Sony BDV-e370), but for every single disc 2 of the main feature, the menu will not come up automatically. I have to push a bunch of buttons on my remote and force the blu-ray player to access the title menu and pick the first one before anything will come up. No matter how long I let it sit, the menu won't come. The movie is great, the sound is great... I'm just frustrated that all the disc 2's won't work correctly and easily."
1,Wrong Information in Web Site,"Be careful with this product. The information provided on the website is wrong. The subtitles are not in Spanish and Portuguese, only comes in English and French."
1,"Holding off, defective product","So I had to wonder why the selling price was basically half off and I now know why. One of the films was obviously messed up before being transferred to disc. The problem is a green tint to the movie so everything, teeth, snow, sky look green.Some have said this was the Directors intentions, other say adjust your TV set. I say BS to those idiots. The other versions didn't have the problem and I've watched stuff from the 1940's to the present without ever having to adjust the TV. Your TV is NOT the problem!And to the trolls saying this isn't the right place to give a 1 star to the product because it's a blah blah this issue (shipping, amazon customer service, or whatever); go take a hike. No one cares!If you were unfortunate enough to have purchased this set and your copy has a problem then return it or do a credit card chargeback dispute. And where the heck is Amazon in all this?!? They should be emailing everyone and returning this junk to the manufacturing facility!"
1,Bad transfer; not worth the price of admission,"There's definitely a tint throughout the Fellowship of the Ring. The snow when they try to go over the mountains isn't white anymore. I certainly won't be watching this. I'll stick with my DVD edition. Did they remaster this on a badly calibrated monitor?Even the blu-ray itself leaves a lot to be desired. While playing the Fellowship both the top and the popup menu buttons were locked out. The only way I could go to another scene was to stop the movie, restart it, select ""play from the beginning"", and then choose scene selection from the main menu. Wasn't being able to get to a menu while the movie continued to play one of the ""new"" features we were supposed to get with blu-ray?"
1,A review for a product that DOESN'T EXIST yet,"Considering that there is no release date, there's shouldn't be any reviews. This is supposed to be a review of the PRODUCT, not the movie. The fact that someone has a copy of the DVD version of these extended editions does NOT justify them putting a review based on how much they liked the movies/dvd version of the extended cut. If you haven't seen the Blu-Ray Extended Editionm, then you shouldn't be writing a review of it."
1,TWO discs per Movie,"This is the ""supersize"" LOTR.However, I'm most disappointed that they didn't come out with ONE disc per movie. (Yes, I'm aware that there is all the extras which makes each movie more than 50GB).However, from a movie viewing experience. If you want to watch it in one sitting you're going to have to watch half a movie and then take that disc out from your blu-ray player and insert disc 2.While this might not be annoying for LOTR fans, it can be annoying for movie buffs who just want to watch a great movie in one sitting.I would recommend getting the Theatrical edition if you want ONE disc per movie.Very disappointed that with all the extras, my movie viewing experience was cut in two."
2,Let Us All Shrug & Acquiesce to the God of Greed,"New Line Cinema is run by marketers, and damned insensitive ones, at that. The ENTIRE reason to shell out for the Blu-Ray versions of these films is to get each extended version on a single disc. Blu-Ray's storage capacity is orders of magnitude above standard dvd, and there is NO excuse other than greed (charging for the second disc) for splitting the Bu-Ray films. Compressed, schmompressed. This set is as much of an insult to the fans as the original theatrical Blu-Ray release was, and is not worth the price. Why should I pay them to spit in my face? Two stars instead of one ONY because the films themselves are so great, no matter the format. However, I'm returning them. I don't care how spiffy the Blu-Ray looks; my player's upconvert works just fine, thank you."
2,So sad The Quality,"It's so sad that been a fan and expect the blu-ray to have great quality picture, but when u get to watch and see how bad the picture is in the first movie, and worst: neither amazon or new line has done nothing to address this mistake. The other problem is that every single of the 3 movies needs 2 discs, seriously? 1 movie = 2 discs.If u are a big fan like i am DO NOT BUY THIS POOR PRODUCT, the lack of respect it's so big."
1,BS!!,Just received pre-ordered LOTR Bluray extended version today 6/27. Excited to download digital copy but guess what....download expired 6/26!!!! Any help out there? This is bogus!
1,Tired of the money grubbing BS...,"Once again, the big movie studios think they can do whatever they want and we, the stupid consumer, will buy it. And buy it again. And buy it again...... And buy it again. NOPE. Not this time. Bite my shiny metal ass."
4,"Love the movie, love the books, won't buy this set","They have waited too long to release this. I already bought LOTR regular on DVD and extended. I rented the standard BD version just once. I will rent this when it comes out, but honestly, I don't see value in shelling out another c-note for something that I will watch only once in the next few years. In my opinion, they were too greedy, if they had release both extended and standard on BD at the same time, I might have bought it, but as it is, I will not."
1,Blu-Ray Extended requires flipping the disc,"It is still way too early, but the editorial review above already states that the discs will contain both theatrical and extended on the same disc and that you will still have to flip the disc over mid-way through the movie regardless of the version you're watching.This is absurd, and I would tell everyone to wait until it is closer to a release date for more accurate information. I highly doubt they will make a Blu-Ray that is double sided and split the movies in 1/2 for each side. I can, however, see one side the extended and the other the theatrical version.It's just too early to make predictions though, so anyone trying to state that they know what's going to happen are idiots and should be ignored."
1,It has previews...,The complete extended edition... of one of the greatest films ever... and they put previews on the disc... You have got to be kidding me!!! Shame...
1,Yar! Keelhaul tha scallywags!,"Were these craven bottom dwellers on me vessel, they'd be walkin' the plank fer sure! T' Davey Jones' locker wi' these discs! They ain't fit ta be coasters in a dinghy full o' fish poop! I be waitin' fer tha extended editions, as all honorable pirates and wenches should be. Now where did me cabin boy go wi' me laptop?"
1,How do I rate thee? Let me count the ways.,"I rate the expected extended Blu-Ray edition of LOTR to be outstanding, first class, the final word in today's technology used for this wonderful epic. BUT I rate New Line as a miserable failure for holding it out of reach merely for the milking factor. I held off buying my first wide-screen TV until the first theatrical versions came out. Next I bought the extended versions. Now that Blu-Ray is becoming available, I WILL NOT DO THE SAME. I don't yet have a Blu-Ray player; I'll get one when the extended LOTR comes out. I will NOT buy any Blu-Ray LOTR until the full extended versions are available, so, New Line, you can just stuff it. If you want to make money off of me, sorry--I'll be watching my DVDs of the extended version. I'll wait for your call, and then I'll buy the extended version on Blu-Ray. But not until then."
1,"Really dissapointing, they have no shame....","It's amazing, the little to no shame they must have, not only to NOT release the extended version together with the theatrical ones, but also to post their little sign saying ""hey, we're not putting this out for another year or two, so if you want hi def, buy the other crap we just put out""...Total rip-off, crooks.. LEt's boycott the theatrical release!"
1,Disappointed,"We recently purchased a blue ray player and home theater set up and this dvd was the highest priority for us. I just received it for my birthday from my family and my children and I eagerly anticipated some time to enjoy it. How disappointing when we finally got to watch. I don't know if it's the version we received but the words and lips are out of synch! (the box is in English and French and the box has digital downloads only available to residents of Canada, but I can't imagine that would make a difference). It was bad enough that I couldn't watch anymore. Sending this back to Amazon and buying my own copy straight from Warner Brothers. Hopefully we won't have the same problem..."
5,Brilliant Blu-ray!,"I'm rewriting my review of the initial extended edition blu-ray release since the studio has decided to permanently reduce the price to a reasonable level (49.99), in other words, we are no longer forced to pay for the DVD version of the extras which we had already purchased previously with the DVD version. Perhaps our own ""Occupy the Film Studios"" has worked at least for this movie release. I'm so glad I waited for the price drop.The blu-ray is brilliant. Some have mentioned the green coloration in The Fellowship of the Ring. I'm pleased to say that I did not have this experience. The movie most assuredly looks better in this blu-ray release than its DVD release. It is a joy to behold."
1,zero stars for the distribution strategy,I also do not like the fact that the studio is quadruple dipping. love the movie can wait for the extended blu-ray editions
5,My favorite movie collection,I love the movies and I am very happy to now own it on Blu-Ray. The case is very detailed and very strong. The cases for the movies themselves are well done. I am very pleased and feel like I got the better end of the deal with the price and all.I would totally recommend for any fan of the movies.
3,Love it.,Awesome trilogy. Love all three of them of course =p or else I wouldn't of bought this.. Great picture. Came in on time.
5,Perfect films!!,"Cant wait for this! ""Please new line"" Dont put this off. You will make just as much$. Make Tolkien Proud!!"
4,Subtitles Languages in Bonus Disc,These interested in acquiring this collection but I want to know:The 9 bonus discs have subtitles in Spanish?And others have subtitle language?
5,BAM,"This IS the product you were looking for. Thanks New Line, for finally giving the people what they wanted. Kudos"
5,Lord of the Movie Extra's,"So, I purchased this looking forward to the extended scenes and the extras and got more than I bargained for. As I am writing this review, I have yet to finish everything on the blue-ray set. It's awsome! I've watched the extra's and the full movie from Fellowship and LOVE IT. The extended scenes round the story out but the making of documentaries give you complete insight into what it took to make the movie. You realize how difficult all of the challanges were that Peter Jackson and co faced. for the ripe price of $48 and change, it is definately worth it! If you want to view the movie and extra's in it's entirety, plan of taking a vacation. Plan on taking 2, the second will be for recovering from 15 discs worth of wonderfully wasted time."
4,A must for the true fan,"Admittedly if you have the dvd versions of the extended cut, there isn't much added. I was actually disappointed that the film is still broken up into two disks. There is room on them, basically they copied the content to the blue ray in full resolution. For the true fan you simply have to have this set, and watch it again before the hobbit comes out this summer"
3,short-changed,I received the selection within a reasonable amount of time but was not sent the Digital copy with the Blue-ray extended edition.
3,Picture didn't match the box,"I was excited to get the LOTR blu-ray box set for $50. When I got the box set, the first thing I noticed was that everything had french 'subtitles.' So under ""The Lord of the Rings : The Motion Picture Trilogy"" on the front of the box was the French translation. This is true for any text on the box. This may not bother some of you, but I'm picky about stuff like that. It looks really cluttered. What's more frustrating is that the price of the box set just went up to about $80, so now I can't exchange it without paying the difference.Moral of the story, double check where the item is being shipped from, evidently my came from a warehouse in Canada.Will up the rating to 5 Stars if I am able to exchange my box set."
5,Excellent,"A new experience--much better than the original films. Different dialog, new footage, extended scenes, etc. that fills in a lot of the blank spots in the original storyline."
5,This is the only way to watch The Lord of the Rings,"Seriously? Are you kidding? They didn't release these versions in the theaters? In the theatrical release, many scenes really didn't make sense to me, the emotions the characters displayed, why some things happened, they weren't in context. So that left me not really being able to get into the characters and story so much and not liking the movies as much as I thought I should have. But in these versions, you get the proper context, you understand better the power of the ring, how Gandalf became the white wizard. These are major threads that need to be shown, not just filler. This version seems polished, complete, not chopped up and rushed. Its like seeing the movie for the first time."
4,Looks great...,But the sound quality is not up to par with Bluray. I was hoping for sound quality like Underworld or Underworld Evolution. Not even close.
5,The Lord of the Rings masterpiece in HD,Peter Jackson has done an excellent job providing us with a high definition experience of the Lord of the Rings. The quality is excellent. All of the amazing acting is that much better with the added detail.Note that I did have a faulty disc during my first order and had to exchange it. However Amazon handled the return seamlessly and the exchanged copy is fine.
2,a desapointment from the beginning,"I'm a fan of the trilogy Lord of the rings and too long I waited to buy it on blu ray, I live in Chile so I ordered fast delivery which never happened it took almost a month and a half to reach my country (i-parcel fault)when I opened it I thought it was worth the wait, but soon my hopes were dashed, the case where all disks are packed is nice had a nice pic, but immediately began to peel, the littles books that come inside the disc box come all ""dog-eared"", and the worst is that the disc of bonus material from the community ""jumps"" constantly, and i'm affraid to put other disc, a total disappointment ..."
5,Own it,"I had this originally for my wish list but found both Two Towers and Return of the King on dvd for only $3.99 at Best Buy. I already own the Fellowship of the Ring. I have a Blu Ray player, but figure I will save someone the cash if they were going to buy this for me if i were so lucky. If I didnt buy the two today, I would still hold on for the Blu Ray. Happy Holidays and wonderful, peaceful, healthy new year."
5,Merry xmas to my husband,"My husband has been wanting this set for a while and I know when he opens it he will be over the moon. Received my package in a timely manner, I am very pleased."
5,Classic viewing,"This terrific purchase was delivered in perfect condition and well packaged. The movies were fantastic, the classic viewing with the fascinating extended coverage. The quality of the BluRay is exquisite; it drops you right into the action. I am completely satisfied with both the product and the seller!"
1,Duplicated and Missing DVD,"After many many hours of watching The Boxsets for first and seco no movies, I gob to ""The Return of The King"".The dreadful outcome was to find out that muy Disc Nr. 2 (The blu ray one - YES, The one with The very END OF THE MOVIE) has The exact same content as DVD Nr. 1.Important to highight that Disc 2 is correctly labeled as Disc 2, so probably aun issue when ir was manufactured.BTW: still waiting for Amazon to reply (zzzzzzzzzzzzzz)"
2,Amazon was professional in handling the problem.,"The 1st set I ordered had a serious problem. Disk 2 of ""Return of the King"" had the WRONG video content, it had the video content of Disk 1 instead. It was an INCOMPLETE set. I requested for a replacement, but the replacement had the same problem.However, Amazon was professional in handling the problem. I got a proper refund at the end of it."
4,DvD on extras,"The only let down on this fantastic collection is that all the extras are SD definition on dvd locked to region 1.The rest, it's one of the best collections anyone can have. The movies look crisp as never before and the package is very well !done"
5,Increible,"Cuando recibi el envio me sorprendi de la excelente presentacion, muy bueno el embalaje, y por supuesto las peliculas increibles. Muchas Gracias"
5,movie,"If you like these movies, than you gotta have this box set. 15 discs covering all aspects of this movie. From where it was shot, who is dumping where, and how the actors didnt get along, this is must see stuff. If you have no life and want to waste 40-50 hours, watch all 15 discs"
5,ALREADY HAVE IT!!!!!,"I hope the studios have learned their lesson. We all know the crap they are trying to pull. So guess what I did... Lets just say that I already have the Lord of the Rings in HD. There already have been 1.5 million downloads on the Pirate Bay because the studios are trying to scew us. They are trying to get us to buy these movies 3-4 times. I just downloaded all 20 gigs of it and it looks AMAZING. Don't buy it here, just download it. This is pure crap what they are trying to do. I don't feel like I am stealing because I have bought The Lord of the Rings 3 times already."
1,Wrong Disc in Package,"as a large number of other reviewers have pointed out, many of these sets ship out with a mislabeled disc. The disc is labelled as the second disc of the third movie, but it's a duplicate of the first disc. We didn't discover this until the return window expired :("
5,Amazingly Amazing!,"For the price, the complete extended collection with the best video quality and video available now, just amazing, a must buy_"
5,stand your ground and wait for extended and boycott the theatrical,If more of us sign up to be notified on the upcoming extended edition release and if we do not 'pre-order' the theatrical edition then the extended edition will be released sooner (this year?) rather than later - it's my theory only but it doesn't hurt trying.
1,Extended Edition [Blu-ray]... Horrible transfer.,"Since most everyone knows the trilogy, this review is of the quality of the blu-ray picture. I also own the extended version on DVD and was excited to purchase the Blu-ray version for the better picture. Unfortunately to my surprise, my old DVD extended versions look remarkably better on my 60"" HDTV than the blu-ray versions. On the blu-ray versions of each movie, there are many areas where the picture is blurry and almost not watchable.Very disappointed in this purchase of the blu-ray extended version of LOTR trilogy. I feel like I wasted my money and would not recommend to anyone even if they had never seen it... I would recommend that any purchase for LOTR, be made on DVD, rather than blu-ray."
2,ATTENTION FOR WHO IS FROM LATIN AMERICA; INCLUDED MAINLY BRAZIL!!!!!,"My lord of the rings arrived last week and when I tried watch the DVDS with bonus and extras was unable to watch because are ""different region"". i HAVE THE BRAZYLIAN dvd PLAYER AND AN EUROPEAN BLU RAY PLAYER AND NOTHING WORKED!!!! Just blu rays runned! I never had problems before with american medias but now I had! I am afraid now to get the LION KING and the STAR WARS from american amazon, in your best version because maybe the bonus and extras have too such problems!"
3,"Great Movie, Greedy Studio","Don't need to go into how awesome these movies were. BUT, they could have had a seemless branching edition with both editions in the same box set. I would love to sit down and watch the extended editions, but my wife thinks the theatrical were already too long. I'm not going to buy both, just these extended that I've been waiting for. Kudos to all you fans that didn't get suckered into buying both."
