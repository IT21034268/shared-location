1,Holes in the Cover,"I live in the desert and bought the pool to keep cool during the summer months. I also bought this pool cover to help keep the dust out of the pool, keep the water and chlorine from evaporating but this pool cover has about a dozen 1/2 dollar size holes in the cover. If i would have known this i would not have bought it and just got an old fashion tarp to do the job. One good breeze actually blew the cover off the pool."
3,OK but nothing fabulous,"Fits the pool perfectly but the quality of plastic is pretty flimsy. Also, after just one month of use stitching around the drawstring started to rip out..not sure if we will get another year out of it. Pricey for the quality, if you ask me!"
1,bad experience with the company,"It broke after the second use. color fade. Try to ask for exchange and send the item back. They rejected my item without the RA# outise the box. If they just simply open the envelope outside the box with the UPS note, they will not reject my item. I paid for my shipping course for return. it ends up my shipping cost more than the item cost. NOT recommended to anyone planning to buy this item and dealing with this company."
1,Awful Fit,"I didn't mind that it tore after my first season, the thing did not fit right. If it would fit like in the picture, it would work. I bought the solar cover this season, it is too big too and don't have the holes in the middle. Even with the holes it collects too much water. I think they should redesign these things. I love my pool though."
1,Pool Cover - 15',The picture of the cover is a little off. The cover actually has a few small holes in the center and a few more closer to the edge which lets rain water and some dirt through. Overall it does it's job. If you have a 12' pool the cover works but will hit the ground it's sooversized.... .
4,"Pool cover, works great!","I got the 12' pool cover and it works great. We have a lot of trees around and it helps keep stuff out. Like when it storms it best to have the cover on, it has holes in it so that I guess when it rains it won't just sit on top and push it down and lets it breath. It's pretty thin, light weight and one person can put it on. It also didn't blow off when a storm came through with strong winds. Held up great. I would recommend it."
4,BLW,"After reading the mixed reviews I still decided to purchase the pool cover and I'm very pleased I did. While others have complained about the holes in the cover. they actually work very well for 2 purposed...(1) lets water drain from the cover into the pool to allow easier time taking the cover on/off(2) allows air to escape when putting the pool cover on, so the pool cover is right on top of the water, with plenty of cover over the sides of the pool. The cover is not going anywhere with or without the string tie pulled tightly.This pool cover is 10x better than the one which shipped with my pool. that was just a plastic, round, thin tarp with a seam which immediately ripped on the first use. This one is well built and should last as long if not longer than the pool itself."
3,"It does the job, I guess....",The pool cover does not fit tightly over the pool as in the picture and as soon as I pulled the strings to tighten the cover around the base it ripped a little. So not a high quality cover at all. Has holes all through it which there may be a reason for that but I'm not sure for what reasons. Not the same color as n the picture at all. If we get a week of real heavy rains like we did this spring I can see myself having to go outside and bail water (lol). It will do the job for this summer (all four months) but will probably have to purchase another one next summer. Great experience with Amazon.com though. Products came quickly and shipping was free:)
1,Do Not Buy,"This is not what it appears to be. It is a debris cover, not a solid cover. It also ties around the edges instead of having an eleastic band to cinch it to the upper rim. When you tighten down on the string to cinch the cover tight the flimsy plastic skin will tear. There are holes in the center that will lay into the water and then let the water come through. This will nearly pull the cover off the pool. You cannot get the string tight enough to keep it under the rim and out of the water. In the wind, this cover doesn't have a chance. THis is just shy of useless."
1,12' pool cover by Intex,"You need at least 3 people to put the cover in a 12' pool. And when I tried to tighten the cord to fasten the cover to the pool, the vynil ripped. So now we have a useless cover. I contacted Intex and I am waiting for an anwer.albertocardonape@gmail.com"
4,must have,"this cover is a must have for the price. even if you have no trees in your yard, all the critters come out over night and this helps keep them out. super easy to use and to store."
4,Pool Cover,"My last pool cover, bought last year when I bought my pool was a 12 ft cover which ripped in the center because it was to big for my 10 ft. diameter pool. This cover was a 10 ft cover and is working very well. It still dips down and touches the water, but it hasn't sunk below the water level which is what caused the first one to tear. The other thing I really like about the cover is that it holds the heat from the sun warming the water. It only warms the top couple of inches, but if you leave the filter running, the heated water is moved around making the pool at least comfortable for us."
2,10' pool cover,"The pool cover has 10 perfectly shaped holes in the center & 10 more about a foot out from the center ones. This was not in the description. The manufacturer said it was so water doesn't lay on top. The problem with that is debris falls through the holes, with rainwater that would have been on the top of the cover."
2,Not very good.,"I purchased this item to try and keep debris out of my pool. It does, I mean did that job until it ripped. The problem with this product is that it is not made out of a very good material and rips very easily. Especially along the seams where it ties. If the product was made out of something more durable I would buy another one, but instead I will stick with a tarp. So if the manufacturer reads this take note......Make it out of a better material instead of sandwich baggie grade plastic."
1,Holes in a pool cover,"Poor design. I understand why there needs to be holes, but why not cover those holes with a fine mesh or something? We have a tree that puts off tiny seeds each year and the cover was pretty much useless for us. My husband now puts on the cover and then a tarp over that. Hopefully after the tree stops seeding it will work properly..."
3,Intex Pool Cover,I like how easy this cover was to put on the pool. Downsides are the holes in the pool cover let in dust and bugs. I wasn't happy when I went to tighten the string that makes it snug and it ripped right away along it's seam.
2,Could be better,"We purchased the Intex pool cover to keep the dirt and debris out of the pool when it was not being used. Unlike the picture, the cover does have about 6 holes near the center. I can only assume this is to let rainwater through. Any dirt or small items that land on the cover, usually end up inside the pool. The filters are not so great on these pools, so any added dirt is a pain.I tore a small hole in the one corner while putting it on last night. I'm guessing it won't last us past this summer. It is cheap, and it does keep out the large debris. I just wish it was a litter more sturdy."
2,Not Worth It,"I bought this cover just over a month ago. We have used it two times prior to tonight. After it was used, we would remove it the following morning and put it away. While putting it on our pool today, my husband went to tie it and the strings ripped. They were completely dry rot all the way around the cover and now the cover is completely unusable. I do NOT recommend this item."
2,Doesn't fit snuggly!,I have the cover for the Intex 8 foot pool. Looks so nice and snug in the picture. It doesn't fit on my pool like that! The best I can do is lay it on top of the water. Am I doing something wrong????????
5,Works great!,"So, I bought this cover to go with the 12x30 easy set pool. It worked great and did its job until the pool continued to deflate. The cover is sturdy and large so make sure there are two people putting it on the pool.I would recommend this product!"
1,Waste your money here,"This pool cover is manufactured with eight 2-inch holes arranged around the cover. If you want to prevent debris in the pool, or even retain some solar warmth, keep looking. This thing is a joke."
3,intex easy set 15-foot pool cover,the pool cover lets water settle on the cover which weights it down. I bought it for a winter cover and don't know yet how that will work but we'll see
3,"strictly for round, not multipurpose","While the quality of the cover is good, the description that it will fit many Intext/Summer Escape pools is not accurate. The 12 foot Summer Escapes pool with Frame does not allow the cover to stay once there is any significant rain fall. The water collects on top (despite holes) and cover collapses in on itself."
4,A good disc of Verdi favorites,"Margison has an incredible instrument, I enjoy his voice. If I find out that he's going to be heard in a opera broadcast from the Met, or that he'll be part of the cast for an opera I'm going to see I feel confident that he'll sing well, and with little vocal difficulty. The reason I believe that he stays just clear of ""stardom"" is apparent on this disc.Margison seems to do little in the way of interpretation. He has two volumes loud and not so loud, he's not very nuanced but its obvious that his voice his in excellent health, and that he has a very secure technique.I do recommend this CD, but be forwarned!"
4,Good Book,We have 2 Australian Shepards who need to be active! This book is great because a lot of the info in it is timeless - such as trails and park info. etc. Living in Arizona means year round outside activities and this book is a great place to start planning hikes with the pups.
5,I love this thing!,"This product is great! I had purchased one before for a different model Nokia phone and, when I bought a new Nokia, immediately went searching for another. This earpiece is much better than the one cellular retailers will give you for free. Theirs are made of an uncomfortable, hard plastic and are circular. The Jabra Eargels are soft and contoured to the shape of your ear. I have to commute an hour to work and can wear the Jabra for my entire commute with no problems. Also, the on/off switch on this model makes it easier to answer the phone. I love the absence of a seperate microphone or boom (which was another thing I didn't like about the free headset). You don't have to worry about positioning it before you begin speaking. ...."
3,About the same as Nokia's,"Although the Jabra ear-gel was much more comfortable than the normal piece of foam, the unit didn't work as well as I expected it to. When I bought my phone, I was given the Nokia hands-free kit for free. THe only time I really used it was in low-reception situations, since I wouldn't have to move my phone a whole lot. WHen I bought the Jabra Classic EarSet, I was expecting it to work better than the Nokia's, which picked up a lot of background noise. Upon receipt of the earpiece, I did not notice a difference between either of the two, other than the color and feel of it in my ear. Over all, it's a great product, but I recommend the other Jabra product, as it's only a few dollars more and worth the price."
5,My son loves this book,"My three year old little boy Nicklas loves this book to death he thinks it the greatest book he has ever heard me read to him, he likes reading it over and over again. He loves the noises the clothes make when froggy puts them on. And he also loves when the mother frog yells for froggy and asks himm if he forgot to put something on, ands how embarassed froggy gets when he forgets to put on his underwear."
5,kids love it,bought this used on amazon and my kids (ages 3-4 1/2) love it. we read it almost every night before bed. its a cute book and i believe its part of a series of froggy character based books.
4,Froggy Gets Dressed,"Frogs are suppose to sleep through winter (as should everyone else), but he didn't want to there was snow out. As he dressed to go out he forgot something - his pants. He came in and got dressed all over again and then he forgot his shirt and coat. He once again comes in to try to get dressed - what no long johns? Once more time he comes back in - it's just too much and he decides to go back to bed.That's the way I feel - why else live in California. The snow is always fun and pretty, but the layers of clothes that are needed are often too much."
1,Froggy is disobedient and his mother does not seem to mind ..,"In the beginning of the book, Mother Frog tells Froggy to ""go back to sleep"" that frogs are suppose to sleep all winter. She tells him to ""wake up when the snow melts"". Froggy replies, ""No! No!"", jumps out of bed, and proceeds to get dressed and go outside. Instead of his Mother addressing his disobedience, she seems to half smile and watches his attempts to get dressed and do what he wants to do. Well, that just ruins it for me. The idea of Froggy having a hard time getting dressed and the repetition which I know kids love is cute, but I just cannot get past the fact that his Mother told him to stay in bed, he chose not to listen, and she was perfectly fine with it! I would rather my children read books that support what we are trying to teach them: that parents set boundaries for their children for a reason and that children need to obey and respect their parents wishes."
5,Great,"I don't find this perfum in any department store,and I found it at Amazon at a great price :)It's so light and refeshing, and I wear it all year long."
1,Chemical Baby Powder,"Kenzo happens to be one of my favorite perfumers so when I saw the bottle and read the fragrance notes, I had to have it! It was a big mistake for me to order it without smelling it first! From the reviews I've read almost everyone says the floral notes are very pronounced, even one of the few bad reviews said it smells so much of flowers it gave her a headache. No one but me seems to think it smells very aldehydic, antiseptic, and powdery, rounded out with a vague hint of floral hair spray. Well, one of my girlfriends hated it too but the only description she gave was ""it stinks"".I'll just stick with Ca Cent Beau, Jungle, and Le Monde Est Beau. Ca Cent and Le Monde, now THOSE are floral and I always get compliments when I wear them. The only problem is it is very difficult to find them in eau de parfum strength anymore."
1,I got a fake bottle,"The bottle of Kenzo Summer I got from Amazon is a fake bottle. It looks and smell qutie the same, but when I compared it with the real one, it really shows. I doubt that I will buy form Amazon again."
3,OKAY BUT COULD BE BETTER,"this is cool.They did not paint anything for you on the deck.but hire somebody to paint it and make it look good. put some grip tape on the board and your ready to go.Heres a trick to save your money for the old school skaters:buy this so when you need new wheels are berrings,Because those ripoff skate shops might do that as well."
1,Chicken Little Strikes Again,"Rifkin is unqualified to write a book of this nature. His writing style is excruciatingly painful to read and he does not understand the key issues or the industry he writes about. His past predictions have NEVER come true, usually just the opposite in fact. This book adds nothing to an intelligent discussion of biotechnology and its impact."
3,Misunderstanding entropy,"Contrary to what the previous reviewer thinks, the earth is NOT a closed system in terms of entropy and energy. The earth receives a huge constant input of energy from the sun. This energy is captured by plants and used to reduce entropy (which is the essence of life). As long as the sun burns (~5 billion years), life will be able to survive and prosper on earth."
1,"False facts, uninformed, waste o' dough","If you want to believe an illusion, go for it. Some readers say he is well informed. Whoa. This guy talks about science without any credentials to do so.If it makes you feel good to believe that the US is bad, the environment is collapsing, and we need socialism to survive, then this is the book for you.If you are open minded but want truthful facts to make your own opinion, find another source.Waste of money."
2,"No ideological axe to grind, but this book was a mess","Mr. Rifkin seems to have a talent for polarizing his readers, I'll give him that. I neither love nor hate his writing, and feel this is a topic worthy of a well-researched book. Unfortunately, this feels very much like the sort of essay that gets written when somebody is assigned to finish x-thousand words by Thursday, and doesn't have time to research the topic. Seriously, in the first hundred pages or so, absolutely nothing happens except Rifkin asserting, over and over, how important biotechnology is. Wouldn't it have been better to provide some examples and let us decide for ourselves whether it's important? Better luck next time, Jeremy."
1,A Real Disappointment,"The Author, Jeremey Rifkin, sets the stage for this disapointment from the beginning when he laments the agricultural and industrial revolutions. He clearly longs for some pristine time in the past, when life was better and simpler. Certainly a common sentiment, but one that lacks the maturity to consider the brief life spans of that time and the social order in which the strong preyed upon the weak.Rather than bore you with details, let me make clear that Rifkin makes his living by writing so as to scare his readers. Always under the guise of educating and serving to simply raise potential concerns and issues, but the message is always the same - industry/biotech/America is bad, Jeremy Rifkin is good."
1,"Tepid ""criticism""","Rifkin is not very critical on the diminishing diversity of life on earth and it's imminent sterility thanks to the ""benefits"" of the cult of efficiency, which Business Week was quick to observe. The phenomenal scientific ignorance of the unfortunate from Brooklyn below, is itself an instance of Entropy as are the cases who found his review helpful, a sorry decline from the elevated conscience's of the sixties & early seventies. Entropy {Boltzmann's Constant} always increases for a closed system, like the Earth, misuse of technology simply expedites the erosion. Deal with it."
3,Critical for informed dialogue --but only one side of it,"Rifkin raises issues that should become part of everyone's consciousness in the future, as genetic engineering gains acceptance and power. Unfortunately, the title of the book led me to believe that it would be a balanced work, with arguments for and against the advancement of Biotechnology. In reality, most of the discussion is spent cautioning against Biotechnology and condemning some of the most recent discoveries in genetic engineering. This book's title promises the full picture of Biotechnology, but delivers a one-sided argument. Read something else after you are done with it, put out the fire with ice."
1,Jeremy Rifkin is an attention-seeking nuthatch.,"Ever since the 70's, a decade that was quite receptive to this type of character, Jeremy Rifkin has been inventing false crises and getting himself media attention for them. I first remember him for a book on the physical principle of entropy, from which he inferred the obviously false conclusion that all human doings are fated to decay and decline. Entropy may increase with time for the universe as a whole, but any subsystem, including the earth and its human civilization, can become more ordered with time. After all, we've been doing just that for 5,000 years or more. Rifkin latches onto, or just fabricates, whatever piece of pseudo-scientific crap he thinks he can get away with - entropy, ""time-wars"", biohazard-chicken-little dross, ad infinitum. The only thing he's really promoting is his career."
4,Guidecraft fridge - not as tough as their other toys,"While I like the product (and more importantly, so do the kids) and it fits well with the oven we bought a year ago, the quality is not as good as the oven. Inside panels are not painted and they are thinner. I am sure that this will last through my kids' use and perhaps a few others but I was a bit disappointed and will not buy from the company again."
4,"Save energy and keep cool, too!","I recently purchased the HAWF-2095 with economy in mind. I wanted to save money and energy costs yet still keep cool. This window fan allowed me to do that with a great degree of freedom as it has a thermostat control that is perfect for nighttime operation and days when I'm not home; while it doesn't ""cool"" like an air conditioner (which also dehydrates your skin) it is capable of sensing the ambient temperature and once you've selected a desired temp and fan speed turn it to auto and you don't even need to think about it. It runs quietly and I've noticed a great deal less dust in my house as I no longer need to keep ALL of the windows open for ventilation; this is especially good if you live in a busy urban area or for people who smoke."
1,A Burned Out Fan,"Upon receiving the fan, my wife and I unboxed it and read the directions. I plugged it in and all seemed to run well. Then I noticed a strong electrical smell, you know, the type of smell before something bad happens. Within moments my wife and I were startled by a loud cracking noise from the right fan, which soon came to a dead stop. The left fan was working happy as Larry though. Our thoughts of having a cool evening quickly diminished as we gathered up the packing materials and proceeded to pack the thing, returning it to the sender. I'll try reordering the product, giving it the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure the next one will work properly. ..."
1,Burned out motor,For the partial of two days this fan worked just wonderful--cooled nicely almost as good as an air conditioner--Then on the third day there was a short time of sweet smell coming from the fan a bang and it never worked again. I am waiting on a replacement as I figure it can't happen again.
2,Plenty of Style but no blow!,"We bought 3 on these units to keep our home cool on the few days the mercury climbs above 85 here on the south shore of Long Island. We previously had box fans that served us well for 4 years but they have slowly died with old age. We saw these and thought they would be a nicer touch then our box fan in the window trick. The units are well made and the easy to install, the only problem is they move little air. A normal box fan on low moves more air then these units on high. So back then go and say hello my old friend... the box fan."
4,Works great,"Only annoyance is that the fan will cycle on/off in a very short time, less than a couple of minutes, as the room temp gets near the set temp. Probably due to the thermostat being in the fan as opposed to remotely located. Doesn't bother me, but my extremely pregnant wife sleeps very lightly.If it works like my other Holmes fans, I expect no reliability issues."
1,AccuTemp digital thermostat operating range,"My AccuTemp digital thermostat operates up to 9x deg F andbegins to malfunction. Like the Y2K problem, a 2 digit thermostat can't handle 3 digits. Don't buy if want to use it near 100 deg F. See my more complete review in one of the other Holmes fans, the one with a remote control."
5,Excellent read!!!,"This is an excellent read and I could recommend it to anyone, the stories are good and very well written.4 romances in the same book I had to get it and haven't regretted it for a moment. I never seem to be able to get enough books to read and therefore books I don't really like, I soon get to really hate. This was not one of those books.I suggest you buy this too."
2,Disappointng,"The product did not fit together properly when assembled. It was good for the kids to see the gears inside and how they worked, but disappointing that it did not work as expected."
4,looks good!,It is a good book for those who wants to consult comparatively contemporary approach to study the gospel of John.
5,a much needed book by a much needed author!,"as i have recently been out of the country in south africa, i see there is a greater and greater worldwide need for astute infrastructural studies on leadership. this is a book that does an excellent job of addressing this need.there should be a copy of this book in every office. and not to mention, in every college class. leadership is integral to our future, and the more widely it is understood that we are all leaders in different ways, the greater our understanding and application of what true leadership can be and is.from a fellow author... bravo les."
3,Fifties TV still fun and cool,"I was really curious about this video as it has three episodes of a Flash Gordon TV series and I'd never seen it..Compared to the earlier efforts of Chas. Middleton and Buster Crabbe it really didn't measure up..but hey my twenty four year old son watched them with me and we got a barrel of laughs watching it together. Irene Champlin as ""Dale Arden"" is really pretty cute and kinda sexy in her furlined outfit.What really awed me though was an enchanted episode of ""One Step Beyond""...blew my mind when a bright object was sighted simultaneously by several soldiers on various fronts in November 14, 1915 at 2230 hours military time. This one episode makes the whole disc well worth the money!"
3,Some handy tips in this book that I couldn't find in doing internet searches.,Nice little addition for some handy tips and the discription and screen shots add easy navigating for the functionality that I was looking for.
1,Pivot Table Data Crunching for Microsoft Office Excel 2007,"I don't see how this book deserves more than 1 star. The sample files for chapter 3 are messed up. For example, figure 3.35 is an easy concept IF the ""month"" field is available in the sample file. If you just read it, it's fine. However, if you want to do it yourself from the sample file, it's frustrating. I hope that the author corrects the sample files here. I'm too frustrated & wish that I can have my money back."
1,Pretty lame.,"Prepare to spend lots of time listening to a breathy Englishwoman read from a script. This is pretty ridiculous, containing about only three actual interviews with the band members, one with Peter Buck stretching over about 8 out of 12 tracks. There's a brief snippet from Stipe from around the release of ""Up"", but it's hardly worth noting. Mostly it's gushing English music reviewers, discussing each album in pointless detail that any fan already knows. If you can find a transcript of Buck's interview that appears on this, skip the CD. Skip the CD anyway."
3,OK Gangster Movie,This movie is only OK compared to others that are available. It is hard to understand in places because of the English accents. Much less violence than in most gangster pics.
5,the book of lists,i was surprised to see it was the Canadian edition but thats on me for not paying attention I love the book anyway thanks
5,Reviewed,"Good book, if you do not want to buy all the individual books in the Office Suite, this one give you a good leg up. If you want advanced features, the help file links provided and the ones within Office will get you to the site."
4,office 2007,I bought this book to help me understand office 2007... it's difficult to use. I am finding I need more books to unlock even more questions I have.
1,Would prefer the hard copy,"I am very displeased espcially now that I have found out the Kindle version is only $2.31 cheaper than the hard copy. What a rip off! The pictures (figures)are also very hard to see on the Kindle screen. I am going to see if Amazon will let me erase the copy from my Kindle, the backup from Amazon and refund my money so I can buy the hard copy."
3,A little lacking on Outlook,"I really bought this to learn more about the new features in Outlook. This was mostly about Word and Excel. My ""Excel - Inside and Out"" book is much better for Excel. I'm currently not using Word much."
2,Not a good reference book,"This book has not been a useful reference book. It doesn't go into enough depth on any topic. If you have used Microsoft software, do not buy this book."
3,Getting to know you....,"I'm still getting to know the many changes in Microsoft Office Home/Student for 2007, but one thing I really appreciate is the ability to save documents as earlier versions of Word, like the 2003 or earlier versions. Computers that don't have 2007 versions of the Office components don't seem to be able to open the 2007 version files. Even my HP laptop with Windows Vista on board couldn't do more than read and print the Word 2007 files after the trial version had expired. I think being able to save docs in earlier versions is crucial! Beyond that I'm still learning to navigate around the menues, etc. I'm sure it's a great product, I just think the learning curve is a bit steep!"
2,Fantasy Masquerading as SF,"Moscoe returns to the Society of Humanity universe, and brings back the characters introduced in two earlier books. Then he has them lose their way in space and end up on a mysterious planet on the other side of the galaxy. A planet that just happens to be inhabited by humans from another lost ship, and happens to be home to supercomputer network that can do anything it wants, if it can just get its act together long enough.While the individual characters are moderately interesting, the plot is completely pointless and arbitrary. Rules change as things go along, and the story really resembles a poorly developed Sword & Sorcery plot as much as anything else."
4,Good space action.,"Colonel Ray Longknife is a desk jockey. Shrapnel earned in battle has made him unfit for anything else. But now he's married and about to be a father. The last thing he needs is for his spaceship to go awry and get sent thousands of light-years off course into an unknown sector of the universe. But once there, a stunning discovery is made. They've found the ship that disappeared three-hundred-years ago on an earth like planet, building a world of their own. Joy soon turns to suspicion, though, as they begin to realize that there is a very sinister underbelly to the seemingly peaceful life of the planet dwellers. Mike Moscoe writes great space action and adventure. His ability to pull the reader into his universe is matched by his talent for creating believable science fiction."
1,"Read the first two parts, then do yourself a favor and stop","This book was a pretty good read through parts one and two, and maybe even could have been brought to a conclusion shortly thereafter, with a short epilogue or something. But it goes on, with part 3 (starting with chapter 47) and seems like it will NEVER end, even though part 3 is only about 20% of the book. The ending is dull, boring and stupid. For that reason alone I give it only one star."
1,Very disappointing,Global warming soapbox masquerading as science fiction. Like one of the previous reviewers said this guy used to be one of my favourite authors. This whole Destiny's Children series has been a waste of time for me
1,Does not work!,"The Passion Copulin Concentrate was a major disappointment. The product claims to have a fruity smell, but when you actually use it, the smell of alcohol is overpowering. Alcohol is listed as one of the ingredients, but the bottle does not give you percentages. There are no instructions on how to use the product, although I do not think they would have made a difference. I saw no change in my reaction from men with or without the product. I am an attractive person, so I do not think it had anything to do with my looks specifically. Overall, it did not work for me at all and was certainly not worth the price."
1,Tried It...Didn't Work,I bought this product based on another review. Don't waste your money! Did NOT work as another had claimed.
3,Hunting Season,"Low-quality movie, but the 3-D works pretty well in some scenes and very well in other ones (a lot of flicker and some blurriness, however). There are some excellent 3-D scenes, including one where the star is preparing a poison arrow for revenge. This is a good movie to get if you are a field-sequential 3-D movie buff and don't mind some eyestrain..."
1,ED WOODS HUNTING SEASON,"This is by far thee worst picture I've seen in weeks! (hey,I watch a lot of movies so shoot me,pardon the pun.)I spiton your grave was low budget,but this made it look likeJames Cameron's TITANIC,I mean I am so speechless whenI saw the trailer(and that's all I've seen,sorry could notget passed that)I thought OH! NOOOOO! You are kidding!I mean this is lower then the T&A; movies 12yr olds stayup for on USA friday nights.I can't even begin,I reallyreally can't I'm sorry I know I'm suppose to give a reviewbut I just can't!All I can say is I bought this at a localused mom & pop's CD/DVD store it was already viewed in thebargin bin pink labled for .27cents and I feel I've beenripped off."
3,"Good performance, dull recording.","A good, if not remarkable performance. My problem is with the recording. Yes, I know Telarc has always been highly regarded, and the recording is very clean sounding. But it's got that typical modern digital sound; flat and two-dimensional. The more remastered analog recordings I hear from that golden era of 1955-1965 (Mercury, RCA, Decca), the more I realize just how lifeless and flat modern digital recordings are. It's a shame, really."
5,Well written,"This is a well written book that gives an overview of the technology of microarrays and their use as investigative tools in functional genomics experiments. I found the technical and analytical descriptions very easy to follow. This is still the only book around that can bring any investigator with little knowledge of molecular biology, data analysis, and/or microarrays up to speed in the field. It is also a good text book for a graduate level course on microarray data analysis."
2,Not well written...,"I am not an informatics researcher, however I hold a doctorate in biotechnology related areas, as well a law degree. I routinely purchase books and journals to keep up. However, the problem with this book is its presentation. It is written in an almost stereotypically pretentious manner to the extent that it clearly detracts from the subject matter's presentation. Did you know that a tissue or cell type may be ""interrogated""? Coincedentally, I happened upon a brief review article by the same author in Nature Biotech. Again the writing was such that it was too much of an effort to extract what was being said. For those who feel drawn to this book, check the internal pages on Amazon's site."
5,Mindful,"Strategic like most of these historian types to spend years of their lives forthe sake of accuracy.....*Attention to details*Historical*Following the Adamic-line, rather obvious who they are......the Europeans, America, Austrialia, S-Africa,Canada, New Zealand*The engineers of the world, of course that most all 3rd worlders want OUR TechnologyThanks for the introspection on OUR Adamic-line Bud"
5,Biblical and World History in One Book,"The ""Lost"" Ten Tribes of Israel...Found! by Steven M. Collins is an excellent book describing both Biblical and world history under one cover. Written apparently as a teaching document it is repetitive where emphasis is intended. It addresses history prior to the Roman-Greco period that current teachings fail to address. An important read for anyone who is interested in ""total"" history."
5,Very good book,"I picked up this book at a local library and for the year read it through and checked out as much of the notes and sources etc... This book is by far the best on the issue, and it is a must have for anyone intrested in the topic wether it be for a student of history like me or biblical studies it's all good. It gave me a new perspective and a new look to our nation, and those around us new and old. I have to say Steven Collins probley nailed it 99% about right, and that is all right with me. Keep wrighting Mr Collins and I'll keep reading and reserching your work as well."
2,"I HAVE ONE WORD TO DESCRIBE THIS BOOK: ""YAWN""",This book was very boring. There wasn't anything about it that made it stand out from other books. JD usually writes good romances but i think that this was one of her worst. I didn't finish this book... I saw no point to it.
3,The Raider by Jude Deveraux,"From the back cover: In Colonial New England, the British are hunting a fearless, masked patriot whose daring foils them at every turn...The Raider. Jessica Taggert, a proud-tempered beauty, thrills to The Raider's scorching midnight embrace, but despises Alexander Montgomery, the drunken town buffoon. In truth, the cleverly disguised Montgomery lives two lives...and only his triumph over the hated Redcoats will free him, at last to know the full pleasure of Jessica's love!"
3,Who Was That Masked Man?,"A man of mystery who strikes daring deeds against the hated Redcoats claims the heart of Jessica Taggert. Alexander Montgomery drinks while his country is shaken by the throbs of independence. Their story is told by Jude Deveraux in the tale WISHES.A good beach read for a new generation of romantic fiction fans who love a good story. Excellent dialogue between the main characters.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and TRAVELERS."
1,Bad bad bad,Some books are memorable because they are very good...this one is memorable because it is so very bad. Worst ever! Not as bad as Captive Bride by Johanna Lindsey but getting very close. My problem? Only a retard wouldn't see past that stupid disguise.
1,"boring, boring , boring","Jude Deveraux is my favorite romance novelist, but this book was seriously lacking. It started off good, but then came as painful to read as getting a tooth pulled.The basic core of the book was good I guesss, but Deveraux couldn't pull it off. I didn't like the two main characters I felt they were stupid and thick headed, especially the female lead Jessica Taggert, who was selfish, mean and a complete idot. The only reason I finished this book was because I bought it.This book is a waste of day."
4,"Great text, check out the new edition","I've taken a look at a previous edition of the Brueggeman and Fisher text and it is definitely the only nuts and bolts handbook for practitioners. If you're new to the field and just out of school, try the Geltner and Miller text, which flows from real estate economics through portfolio analysis, reads like an MBA manual - it isn't as bad as most reviewers say, they're just stating where they think they are. These two are fundamentally different books, but just as worthy in their own area of approach.Be advised that a new edition of Real Estate Finance and Investments has just been published in June 2004 by McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0071238212 - check it out on amazon.co.uk if you can't find it on amazon.com. Should come in at about seventy bucks. Well worth the cash, if only as an aide-memoire."
4,A Must,This is one of the best books I have ever read about real estate. I read plenty of books on real estate but this one does a great job on explaining how the real estate industry works. It talks about residential real estate market and its financing. Then it goes on to commercial real estate. It talks about real estate development and then the secondary market.It really is a great book that I would recommend to anybody interested in real estate. As a real estate appraiser I gained a lot from this book.
4,"Solid and practical content, but could be better written for students","I bought this book to prepare myself for an internship at some real estate company. Overall, I really like this book because this book:1. covers extensive areas of real estate finance with solid contents2. it comes with a CD that lets you see many of the examples given in the book on spread sheets.3. it gives you a trial version of Argus software.What I didn't like about this book is:1. it doesn't give exercises on each component it teaches, so you won't have chances to learn and practice. You will have to wait till the end of each chapter and do problems which are very hard without practicing small exercises.2. in addition to 1, it doesn't have any answers in the end of the book, so there is no way you can verify your answers.3. this book would be so much easier to read if it broke down long paragraphs into smaller ones and used bullet points.I would still recommend this book since it is very good overall."
4,TV COMPILATION!!!!!,Fairly decent selection of tv shows in rather decent condition. The Highway Patrol episode is the only problem with some splices in the first couple minutes. No watermarks.
4,Surprisingly Melodious & Sweet,"The peyote songs of the Diné are quite different from our own and I would say that in terms of musical quality they are actually better. I don't see how these songs could be more effective than our own in an actual mitote setting but they are very catchy. Sweet melodies on this album. Paul Guy Jr and Teddy Allen both sing very well, in a higher register than do our own singers. if you're only going to buy one peyote-song CD, it doesn't HAVE to be this one, but there's nothing wrong with this one being it."
3,"Look at the mug shot, but read Essex instead.","Foster's book is a sensationalistic tabloid-esque review of the trials and tribulations of Bettie Page.While his account of Bettie's troubles with mental health and the law are interesting and revealing (the mug shot does look like an aging Bettie), his facts on her life are taken (often almost verbatim) from Karen Essex's ""Bettie Page: The Queen of Pin-up.' Essex's book is much better done with more photos (and what else do we all love Bettie for?), more details, and much better writing.While Foster tries to give us the impression that Bettie's later years have been besieged with evil promoters wanting to take advantage of her (although that is believable) it seems to me that he should be ashamed of himself, as he comes of little better than they do."
2,bland,"This book is good if you want to know the basic facts about Bettie; movies she did, marriages, places she lived.The book never gives you a feeling of the type of person she was, even the sad parts of her life are described in a mundane manner. I would never have guessed that such a famous pin-up could lack this much personality. I'm sure she doesn't, so it must be the book."
3,"""The Real Bettie Page"" by Richard Foster","I read Richard Foster's book about Bettie Page, and even though I found his book to be interesting, I also have to question his motive in exposing Ms. Page's problems after she left her modeling. He seems to come across as arrogant in his justifications that ""the truth will set her free"" by exposing the sexual abuse she suffered as a child, her crimes that she committed in later years, and her stays in an asylum for schizophrenia. It was not his truth to expose, but Bettie's.She should be the one to come clean about her past, and not someone like Mr. Foster. He claimed that it was a ""personal struggle and dilemma"" to write his book on Bettie. Obviously it wasn't. Other than that, this book was quite informitive about Bettie's childhood, her modeling career, and her life up to this point. She should always be remembered as the beautiful woman with the bangs, and not as the out-of-control woman that Mr.Foster portrays her as in his book."
3,"A bit of truth, a bit of fallacy.....","is how I would sum up this book. A warning to all Bettie fans- some of the pictures in this book do not glorify or portray Bettie at her photogenic best. If you're looking for that, check out Betty Page- Queen of Pinups, and the three coffee table books, Betty Page Cult Model 1950's Books 1,2, and 3, printed by Esthetique Fetish and Bizarre from Italy.First and foremost, The Real Bettie was written by a journalist. It's written adequately, but seems to be slanted towards the author's viewpoint, and that may be to exploit the public's fascination and minimal knowledge of Bettie's real life. I believe the author may have exagerrated and embellished facts about Bettie, but who knows for sure? Either way, this book will present a lot of information to you that may shock you, and that can be a good thing or a bad thing."
2,rank but revealing,"As others have clearly opined, this is a juvenile and cliched bit of writing ....that Bettie's lost past is revealed is what it is... she lives in a group home for the mentally ill with regular meetings with a psychologist.....(at the time of this writing 1996) as others including her brother jockey for her rights and profits is....well the under belly of the american dream...what would be of worth is a biography that is based on her and others remembrance of what she did, how she felt and her dreams or thoughts....there is no depth here , some fact, many assumptions. However we are not going to get any reliable information from a very lost woman who must be visited by a case worker every week....there is no amount of money or fame that can change that fact....may she find some peace if not in this lifetime but the next...and as a footnote....why would anyone make assumptions about a person they see in a photograph?"
2,Taking his piece of the Bettie Page pie...,"Not particularily well written. So, if we are to believe the revelations in this book, it only proves that Bettie was just as human as you or I. Well, I, for one, already knew that. She's still the best!In response to one of the more inane reviews: Just because someone says something is true, does not make it so. My guess is that you're a big Michael Moore fan!"
3,Clunky telling of a riveting tale,"Sorry to tell this to customer reviewers who prefer to ignore the sadder facts of Bettie's life, but she really did disappear from public view as a result of a slide into madness and violence. Foster's book is the first discussion of the FACTS of Page's life, rather than of the image and the fantasy. Admittedly, he's not an elegant writer, but that's more than compensated for by his skills as a researcher. His book is the result of a clear-eyed examination of the life of a woman he clearly likes and for whom he clearly has a great deal of sympathy. Bettie comes across as mostly sympathetic -- even as she falls into darkness. If the truth matters more to you than the image, read this book."
2,A primer of Bette,"It's all in the book. All the dark and sad moments of Ms. Page's life. I admit a morbid streak which prompted me to read this book, but afterwords there was a sense of why did I need to know this much about her life. Did I enjoy her work more because of this knowledge? No. You may enjoy this book, more than I, if the sensational is your cup of tea. I took one star off because it is written in a 6-8th grade level English and it was annoying. Put your monies down and takes your chances!"
3,The Real Bettie Page Book Review,"This was an interesting book but seemed a little lurid to me, I was fascinated by the pictures in the book, which showed both the naughty and the nice Bettie Page. I would recommend it for hard core Bettie Page fans, but it would have made a better read if Bettie Page would have cooperated with the author and given her side of the story. We aren't really given an insight into the slide into insanity and her stays in mental hospitals. Without Bettie's version of events it is hard to know what to believe."
5,"This is a fantastic poetry book, amazingly put together.","At a glance at the cover, I was drawn to it by the beautiful intertwined sphere of colors. Reading from page to page, I find the poems very realistic,soothing and entertaining. It is very much of a though-provoking collection of poetry that expresses unique opinion on a plethora of subjects,including the frequent abuse of ideology, the realizations of strength, weakness and the controversal nature of politics. It employs literary techniques such as onomatopoeia, similes and metaphors to produce a well-rounded compilation of ideas. Chijike Creed"
3,Would you be ready to sacrifice the music solely for its sound quality?,"After having bought this CD, I am more inclined to believe that there is no good digital recording of Scheherazade, and one has to turn to analogue transfers - which are otherwise excellent. This CD benefits from the digital era technology. The quality of recording and sound is unbeatable. But, there is something missing, or maybe my ear is now accustomed to listen to Stokowski's reading or that of Beecham and Fedosyev. Even Gergiev's conducting has not been very satisfying. Charles Mackerras was a talented conductor and he has left some very fine recordings like those of Brahms's symphonies or that of Josef Suk's Scherzo fantastique. But in this recording, his conducting is somehow unimaginative and mechanical. The worse is Capriccio espagnol, which is dull."
4,Exquisite Scheherazade!,"I confess, Sheherazade is my all-time favorite piece of music, bar none. You only need two four-letter words to describe this recording: FULL and LUSH. This recording is romantic to the hilt. Mackerras carresses every last drop of ecstasy out of the London Symphony Orchestra. His Sheherazade is breathtakingly hypnotic, not unlike the lady herself. It is like a fine opiate. (By the way, Mackerras approaches this piece with a technique similar to the great Sir Adrian Boult.) The soundscape provided by Telarc will absolutely blow you away! It is like an opening into another dimension. The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is the inclusion of the Cappriccio Espagnol. While it is a nice piece in its own right, it completely burns away the intangible, drug-induced haze that is woven so carefully for you by Sheherazade. By it for Mackerras' Scheherazade alone. This version kicks butt and takes names!"
3,Decent product,"Best used as an emergency back up only. Not nearly the longevity of use as the original LI Battery, but when unable to charge, beats not having it!"
1,Poorly made!,the first time I used the alkaline pack one of the metal leaf srpings broke and it didnt work after that!
1,NO Batteries!,Guess I should have read the reviews before ordering! I'll buy the $52 lithium battery....
1,Go See the T.S. Eliot Play,"I got a severe case of deja vu watching Pizzetti's Assassinio nella Cattedrale. It reminds me of Ambroise Thomas' opera Hamlet. Even though I studied French for six years, translating a Shakespeare play into a French opera just doesn't work for me. It loses the subtlety of Shakespeare's English and, worse, appears trite.The same is true with T.S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral as an Italian opera. If I were fluent in Italian I might notice some of the flavor of Eliot, but when I read the English subtitles, I just see a murder of Eliot's play. Beyond that, the opera is boring. Nothing interesting happens.I generally agree with the two earlier reviews of this opera. I just don't understand why they would give it four stars."
2,Not What I expected,The product ad stated and showed a picture of the cream Tommy girl and I received TGirl which is completely different itemAnd my wife was not so pleased due to it was one of her christmas presents
5,Simple and Affordable,"This is a great strap. I haven't put it to a lot of use yet, but so far it is holding up great. Nothing fancy. No fancy designs, just a good simple product that does what it's supposed to do and does it well."
1,Mean spirited,"I was very disappointed with this novel. First the King's wife dies, then he is exiled, then the foster father for his kids dies (a nice old dwarf you never meet), then the daughter dies, the villian is introduced but has no depth, he is just evil and predictible. All this jut to set up the story. And I couldn't believe that this was written by a women, the females either die or have no depth. Terrible book."
3,Not so bad,"The characters were interesting but I found the plot confusing and slowmoving. The book does show, however, a very fertile imagination on the part of the author. Once you are in to one you will want to read them all. Personally I would prefer ""Moonspins and Widdershins."" Loved it."
3,enjoyable,"""The Sword"" is a fantasy novel in two pieces. The first half tells of the fall of a king. The second half follows his son Dain, raised in poverty, as he tries to earn a place in a lord's keep.""The Sword"" is a highly unusual novel in that the second half is better than the first half. The first half is all just background information, worth skimming if you intend to read the entire series, but fairly pointless otherwise. The problem with the first half is you just can't avoid the spoiler on the back cover. The second half is well written and fairly entertaining. There is a bit of point of view hopping, but not excessively so. The characters have interesting, robust personalities."
3,A Pleasant Surprise!,"I was on my way out to vacation when I picked this book up at the counter of a grocery store en route to purchasing some last minute supplies. I had never heard of the author but the selection at a grocery store is limited so I made my choice. I was gratefully surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I rarely give the first of an untried series above a ""3 stars"" so don't let the ranking fool you. When I returned home from vacation, I went straight to Amazon.com to see when the release of the second book of the trilogy was. The character development is good and you find yourself interested in what befalls them after every page."
1,Fan Fiction?,"...this is some of the worst written drivel I have read in a long time.I title this review ""Fan Fiction"" because that is truly what it reads like- someone with a great mind for fantasy ""concepts"" but a complete inability to formulate any sort of prose. There is no continuity in the writing, and the author uses ""powers"" to help her characters when they need help, then discards those abilities when they need to be in danger again.Additionally, the improper use of similes and metaphors astounds me. What kind of editing is involved in making a book like this?Sorry to come out sounding so negative, but this is the kind of garbage that makes outsiders to the genre of fantasy laugh when they see people reading it..."
5,Great Characters,"I totally enjoyed this book. I purchased the next two volumes before I even finished the first book. The plot is excellent and I would suggest this to anyone who likes Robin Hobbs,Terry Brooks, etc."
4,Gold or Garbage?,"First off the series as a whole is very entertaining. The main characters were very likable, or hate-able depending on which one you are talking about. Over all a good series. The plot was pretty shallow, a cliche boy from nothing is really a king thing, and has been stomped into the ground by fantasy writers in the last few years. I really cannot tell you why i liked this book so much, it was not original by any means; the typical journey of a fantasy novel, same hero you have read about in countless books before and the same basic plot that i mentioned above. But other than it's shortcomings a delightfully read. i would highly recomend this book for young adults and fantasy readers who don't have an entertaining read at the time. it is no 'Song of Ice and Fire' but still i must give it four stars for shear entertainment value. The best way to describe this series is like a mediocre movie that you just really enjoyed, nothing special but worth checking out."
3,Poor character,"I liked this book, but unfortunately the sequel does not keep up with the first volume.I liked the boy's adventures and even if the story doesn't stand out for its originality, I found it quite enjoyable: the lost prince, the lost heritage, the quest for the magical talisman... if not new, they were at least decently developed.The characters also seemed quite interesting...but in the following two volumes the main character loses all depth: as long as he was a commoner he was 'true', but as soon as he discovers his true identity he suddenly IS a prince. There is no struggle, no hesitation, no CHANGING, one day he is a foundling and the next he is an arrogant noble. Bah.I would suggest Miss Chester to read TheBoneDollsTwin (by Flewelling), just in order to see how a believable -and wonderful- character is developed.Three stars for the first volume, two stars for the following ones."
3,to slow for me,"I've been trying to read it for the past few weeks, but I'm moving to slow. I read just a little over 100 pages. To slow for me: description after description after description, and when u think something will happen she gets into another description. If I remember right from these first hundred pages maybe a total of 10 is action or dialogue! I'll try my best to finish it. I really like her Ruby Throne, so I'll try this one maybe it gets better. If it gets better I'll come back with an update!Update: it got better and interesting after ther first 100 pages. If you want you can skeep them and start from there. The books gets better, now i'm at the last chapter. Because of this 100 boring pages, I'll give a 3, climbing from 2 stars, instead of 4. WIthout"
3,"May not be Lord of the Rings, but it's entertaining nonetheless","Deborah Chesters's ""The Sword, The Ring, & The Chalice"" trilogy isn't really as epic, nor as unique, as Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", but it's acceptable enough as a fantasy tale. The first installment, ""The Sword"", is a great introduction to many characters that you either care for or love to hate. Despite some obvious cliches, the plot is very interesting, and the characters are well-developed. The pacing flows nicely: never rushed, never slow. I enjoyed it when I read it.Grade: C+"
2,Couldn't get past first chapter,"It's very possible that the plot and character development are first-rate. I wouldn't know, because I couldn't get past the inferior writing. My guess is that much of the problem lies in an editor who couldn't be bothered to edit the cliches and repeated words (the king is ""disgusted"" two sentences after he says something ""in disgust"").I was actually stuck in a car for nine hours when I picked this up, and chose to stare out the window instead. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because it seemed to have potential as far as the plot."
3,Um . . .,"No offense to those of you out there that enjoyed this book. And no offense to you, Ms. Chester, if you happen to come across this review. However, I feel I must voice my opinions. For me, this book moved along way too slowly. I was hoping and expecting for a lot of excitement, enchantment, danger, magic, and maybe even a bit of romance. Instead, I didn't get any of that. Well, not completely. But it was a very meager amount. Also, I got too many descriptions. A few parts that described the history of some place or another took FOREVER. I know, I know. A good author has to let the reader know where he/she is reading about. But you don't have to BORE the reader. And so, I am just saying, that if any of you out there like action-packed science fiction, I don't recommend this book."
3,"Predictable, Moderately Entertaining Fantasy","When I first picked this book up it seemed like a fairly interesting, if somewhat typical, medieval-esque fantasy novel. By the time I was half way through, I could have had a score card of how many fantasy novel cliches had been incorporated. We have elves, of course and some bonus dwarves. Our hero is a half elf prince who is torn by his conflicted heritage. There is a conflict between paganism and thinly veiled Christianity. As a bonus, there is a thinly veiled holy grail. The good noble king is lost through magical misfortune. The woman raised as a son must lead an army. A debauched king and his corrupt son. blah blah blah. We've seen these elements a bazillion times before, and Chester does little that is interesting with them. While this book is not actually bad, it's really not worth the money. It's a rehash of half the fantasy novels you already have on your shelf."
1,no review. I never got the map.,The map showed backordered for over two months without any future estimate date for delivery so I cancelled the order.
2,"Michael Echanis, American Ninja, Or The Special Forces ""Count Dante""","i'vc had this book since i was 7 years old. i loved the awesome photos of echanis doing his thing. if you like the elaborate and complex, then this is the knife fighting book for you. there are simpler ways of ""getting it done"", but few are more fun to try. and, by the way, if any of you are curious as to how he died, he was killed while ""training"" in nicaragua. hmmm . . ."
1,Skip this one.,"My first impression of this book was ""If these are Special Forces knife skills, then I seriously hope they never run out of ammo."" Too much using your various body parts to block cuts, and no consideration of the your apponent's left hand might be doing while you tango with him. Get something else."
2,"Pretty, graceful & useless","Mr. Echanis's untimely death & a publisher's clever advertising ploy elevated him into a folk hero. Regrettably his books, while nicely bound, are filled with techniques that would be difficult in a dojo & fatal on the street. His knowledge of hapkido & aikido are not translated into ""combat"" tactics & are at best highly questionable. His books have recently been touted as ""too deadly to be revealed until know""; a true statement if one considers the reader's health & safety to be what's in danger. Mr. Ellner's recommendations for other texts would be far better ways to spend one's money. While many hapkido instructors in America shy away from teaching serious street self-defense moves, there are some, along with (non MMA, NHB) combat-oriented jujutsu teachers, who would provide decent instruction - provided you research the matter well. If one has to study from a book, make sure it's a good one."
5,Especially for Winter Babies!,"My son was born in mid December, and in Texas (at least this year!), it meant COLD COLD COLD! Using this meant no blankets flying away in the wind, and no blankets to fumble with while snapping the infant seat into the base (they'd always get caught in between the seat and base). It also covered all around his face, which blankets don't do. The inside of mine has fuzzy wool-like material, and it's insulating and keeps him warm. I didn't have the blue one, but a brown corduroy one. It also has loops on the side to keep the sides down and the wind out. I'd definitely recommend it for the winter babies. It's a must-have!"
3,Not very useful for my baby,I never got to use this for my daughter even though she was 3-6 months through the winter. Every time I tried to use this it tickled the sides of her face and made her want to nurse. This may not be a problem for a taller baby or a bottle fed baby (I don't know) but it never worked for us.
3,Try it with your car seat first,"Now that my son is bigger this works fine. At first the hole for his face was too high, his face was in the zipper part. I couldn't use it until he was about 2.5 months old and he is a big baby. Also the straps on the side don't really fit my car seat well. I had to improvise. I have a Graco car seat. But now that his head is higher it works great. However because the straps don't work well for my car seat I think cold air can get in the sides. What I like is that it doesn't take up room inside of the car seat, like others do. The problem with those, is that the straps in the car seat can get too tight for your baby with all of the cushion inside."
3,Cute but looses it's squeak.,"We registered for this adorable blanket and received it as a gift. It is really cute and I love the lion's fringe mane! The size is not particularly generous, but it is decent. It is a nice warm blanket and has stood up to washing as far as the fabric goes. However the squeak hasn't held up so well. At first it squeaked nicely but over time it has become weak and takes several squeazes to get it to make noise. My son is only eight weeks old and I'm afraid that by the time he is old enough to appreciate the squeaking lion, it won't work at all. I would recommend either not buying it until your child is older or pack it away and save it for when he will appreicate it. But then again... he might be upset if the lion loses his squeak!"
3,Anecdotal bunk,This review refers to the 1969 publication that was a vanity publication at best. I really didn't find any practical explanations for keeping donkeys. I was amused with the description on how to DIY panniers a long ago skill that would otherwise by lost.
4,Amazing! True,"This book is detailed, factual, and compassionate about this New York City tragic event. If NYC is your town, and the Empire State building's facinating history piques your interest, you will find this a quick and enjoyable read."
1,This book is fools gold,"This book contains little to help investors new to the penny share arena. Ok - it explains some of the jargon, but this could be achieved in 5 minutes. It dwells on the authors past successes (even his poor trades become winners, only other parties seem to make a loss).The book provides no strategy to penny stock picking, and contains errors. The book does offer some hope to those wanting to enter the penny share market because it seems you can be a success with poor maths skills, no concept of profit and a haphazard approach.Book is small in size and content, offering little that will help anyone take their first steps into Penny Stocks."
1,the gold rush?,The book was poor because the strategies were weak. Recomending that traders do technical analysis on penny stocks with little volume is reckless advice. I also didn't care for 1/4 of the book being dedicated to bulletin boards. A nice attempt but not much in the way of useful information.
3,A little thin,"Most of this could be learned in a couple of evenings on Raging Bull. In fact, I frequently got the feeling that's exactly how he researched this book. On the other hand, if you find more credibility in the printed page, this is a quick way to learn the basics of OTC trading."
1,No Substance,"I can't believe that any of the other reviewers have experience trading stocks. This book doesn't give you any concrete startegies. Basically stick with the top 100 volume pennies and then scan the online boards for ideas. He says to have a plan for exits, but it is basically take a guess - no rational. In one example he has a 5 stock portfolio, then ""adds"" up all the gains and says he had a net return of over 1800%. While still impressive, the gain on the portfolio is closer to 400%.The only decent advice is to use limit orders so you don't whacked by slippage, and to do due diligence (though he admits he doesn't on most picks). This book is pretty much an intro to pennies then fly by the seat of your pants. It doesn't deal with pennies on the NASDAQ or NYSE, just OTCBB and pink sheets."
2,Not for beginners,"Its title is misleading, making us believe that it actually was written for dummies. But it's not. The author has to rewrite this book for true beginners who want to learn J++ programming in a clear and concise way."
3,"Easy, but confused","It was my first book for Visual J++. I have found some explanations made me understand easily. However, it is very confused for me to follow the examples in the book. And, I really don't like that he used a lot of joke in main and sub titles. I would believe that these titles supposed to have concentrated and abstracted meaning for the chapters. This is good for only brief view for Visula J++, actually Java."
5,Good Job,"Well written, has step by step training and I would recommend it for all beg & intermedate users.It does not cover things like how to put a file path in the footer by using quick parts (a tab on the footer screen), if you like short cuts or know how to do a task other than a menu, this book is weak. I like to customize things and like to ALWAYS have a backup way of doing things, which is the way of Microsoft Products.Do your research, but when in doubt, this book is a safe bet."
3,"Not bad overall, but weak in one key area","In a nutshell, the author's weak coverage of headers and footers as they relate to various section types is a disappointment in this book. Arguably one of the more complicated and tricky to learn aspects of Word, this topic deserved a more in-depth look and visual examples. I ended up having to buy yet another book to supplement this one. Otherwise, not bad."
5,Upgrading,"I am familiar with the microsoft Word and will be upgrading to the Word 2007. This book has helped with the new look and feel, as well as the upgrades to Word."
5,Simplifies Word 2007,This book should be close to anybody new to Word 2007. It takes you through the mysteries of the new program. You must begin somewhere or you'll be lost. This book is a good place to start.
4,The Source,"Very good reference book although I had to rely heavily on the index to locate what I needed. I'm not sure I gained any benefits switching to Word 2007. Everything completely changed. It was like driving left side and then one day someone tells you, ""Guess what? We're driving right side."""
1,Useless for common problems,I bought this book in order to solve a style formatting problem in several documents key to my business. The book provided no insight or help.
2,Too Big Too Hard to Find Anything,"If you know little to nothing about Word 2007, this is not the book for you. It too often assumes you know the answer to the question you are trying to answer. Common terms that you might use if you are familiar with 2003 are not used here, so the index is useless. Save your money."
2,mostly useless,"I recently switched from Word Perfect to Word and wanted in-depth help with an annoyingly complicated software package. Unfortunately this book is great in explaining the obvious but fails in deliver the real goods. Now, three months later, I have to say that the MS Office built in help (yes, the one that comes FREE with MS Office) is as detailed, more convenient to use, better, and actually answered my questions. This book is a waste of money."
5,Beyond The Gilded Age Of The Adirondacks!,"From the 'opening' of the Adirondacks in the 18th Century to the present, Harvey Kaiser delivers a premier photographic history of the Great Camps of the Adirondacks. Exploring the architectural history from an owner's whinsey to the details of a porch railing, Kaiser guides the reader through a history of gorgeous excess and an age of bountiful richness that few knew. Camp Uncas (owner J.P. Morgan), Topridge (Marjorie Merriweather Post) and Nehasane (Dr. William Seward Webb) are just a few of the detailed highlights showcased in this volume. Many of the larger hotels and lesser known camps (and castles) are photographed and discussed here at length. This book is not just for the architect, builder or historian. It is a display of architectural beauty build into a unique and mysterious landscape. It is a history never to be repeated and never to be forgotten."
4,Ebb & Flo - Ebb's New Friend & 12 Fun Stories,Just forgot to check if the DVD was compatible for my country. My mistake. Works on some DVD players just not ours.
4,GREAT FUN!,"Excellent DVD of a great cult film. And don't worry about the language the previous review mentions. Considering the reviewer is from France, it's unlikely they've even seen this release to make a judgement on the quality of the disc, which is the best this film has ever seen in any form. No matter, by this time, Shaw Brothers Studios were dubbing and releasing their films in Cantonese and Mandarin in theaters at the same time. Considering there's at least three or more languages spoken in the film, the studio had their own dubbers, who usually were not the stars of the film anyway. So there's no ""correct"" soundtrack for this film, no matter what the ""experts"" will tell you. It won't affect you're enjoyment of the movie in any way."
2,Wrong soundtrack : Mandarin instead of Cantonese !,"""The Boxer's Omen"" has been released only in VCD in HK (by IVL). So I was hoping that the R1 release from Image Entertainment on DVD would be a good means of seing it in perfect conditions.Unfortunately the soundtrack is not the original Cantonese but Mandarin...(Same problem with ""The Super Inframan"" from the same label.)"
3,One The Ugliest Movies I've Even Seen,"This movie is definitely not for everyone's taste. But for those who are keen on viewing cult movies, it is an extremely good choice. The director Kuei Chi-hung is noted for making cult movies, and The Boxer's Omen is one of his very best. A little warning, better avoid viewing this movie while you are eating, otherwise you may throw up upon seeing certain scenes."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!,I ordered the western shirt pictured above. They sent me something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from what I ordered. They thought it would be OK to substitute something else because it was the same price. THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS! I'm warning you so you won't get swindled the way I did. I sent it back for exchange. They never sent me the right one I ordered. They should not be on Amazon.com...they should not be in business at all.
2,Not what I ordered,I thought I was getting the purple stripe shirt and instead I got a beige and white pinstripe. Very plain and ugly shirt. Now I have to pay shipping both ways on this shirt.
3,good research information but very repetitive,"The book is a honest explanation on the positive effects of praising others.in my opinion it fails to show more strategies on how to solve real issues withe negative people around us. for example: I can't find nothin real to praise to a coworker that is depresive, all the time looking for responsibility on others, pesimistic and anorganized. Even I know what this person is good at I cant help because long time ago she is not doing it.The book provides good research information capable of discovering new ways of praising as a positive practice and also stresses that the way of praising should be focused on the endividual.I think this book can be a good choice for starting your research about the effects of positive thinking."
3,$3 worth of knowledge,This book has some very good points. I'm only giving it three stars because there are only about 80 pages worth of reading material. Most of the pages have a lot of empty space and the font is rather large. All in all it took me seriously maybe 20-30 minutes to read and I don't read that fast.The points are pretty obvious but we all need the obvious pointed out once in a while. If I had known the content was like this I would have never paid $13.57 for it. $3-$6 maybe. At best.The three stars are simply because it helped me in a 3 star kind of way.
5,Effective Simplicity,I have purchased 5 copies of this book and will continue to buy it for the ones I care about. Such a simple concept and so effective. It allowed me to feel comfortable changing my life.
3,How full is your bucket?,It is just another book trying to solve all human problems with an individual phrase.
5,Full bucket,"I had heard about this book, and it was an easy read. Excellent ideas to implement in everyday living. Wish everyone would read and put in practice the simple things that ths book suggests. We would all benefit. None of the suggestions really require any or a large expenditure of cash."
3,"Helpful, but slim on content","First the positives:This book did alter the way I see the world and had an impact on the way I interact with people. My life has improved since I read this book because I am not my usual, negative self.Second, it has a clear message; be positive -- and your relationships will be stronger and you will be more effective in your interactions with people.However, the problem is that I finished this book in about two hours, because it's very short (few pages, few words per page, and many pages with little content). Also, the book doesn't have many strategies on how to implement its premise. Overall, I'd recommend it, but not highly."
4,Sound advice for everyone to invest in and grow,"I received this book as a gift and I think there are many pearls of wisdom buried in the pages. I think it's funny but the most valuable advice that I took from this book was the ratio of 5:1 positive/negative. Specifically how you should talk to your spouse and the probabilities of divorce. An extremely interesting survey from Gallup and one that I will make sure that I invest my time. It's amazing how many books are written about managing and leadership and don't discuss how you can use these same techniques to improve your own personal relationships. This book did a great job of including personal and business realtionships. In summary, a very good book and good investment of your time."
2,"Full bucket, but empty book.",Let me save you the hour it takes to read this book: being nice and positive will make you feel better and maybe live longer.
5,How Full is Your Bucket,Great book! It provides insight into how to communicate with co-workers and subordinates if you want to engage them in their work.
2,Nothing New,"I paged through this book at Target for minutes. It's a good read, but nothing new here."
3,Everything you already knew,"This book contains every hint about making people feel good about themselves and thus giving you affirmation back. Its everything you already knew to do, but it was a good reminder to read it all in a short book again."
2,Mostly fluff,The concept is good but I got the point after two pages and the rest was fluff or pictures to take up space.
2,Nice but short on substance,"Well it is hard to write something negative about a book that tells you to be positive so I will keep this short and sweet. Be nice, be positive, be helpful and that is the message of the book. All good things but the examples and content are really thin. You will be wanting some researched, important example of a point and he will say "" I knew a wife who talked nice to her husband and their marriage improved"". So it's OK here but don't expect to be wowed."
5,What a pleasant surprise!,"I am usually a positive person, but this book made me examine how even the little things I say and do make an impact on people. The book has concise, heartwarming examples and left my bucket overflowing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a more fulfilling and rich life. I truly enjoyed it."
2,Corny,"Man, this book was really corny. The worse part was that about 20 people in my office read this as part of a lunch time ""book club."" I can sum up the book in this sentence.Be nice to people or else they will feel bad and not work as hard."
3,Nothing wrong with accentuating the positive,"This book reminds everyone to be nice to each other, that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar and that it is not nice to hurt other people's feelings. It is actually more of a brochure stretched out to book length with every other page devoted to rather cheesy graphics. While I am generally a very positive person reading this book made me feel like the author was making money off of lessons most of us learned in Sunday School as children and in second grade from our teachers. The idea that one can make friends and influence people by being nice and ""filling their buckets"" is certainly probably true, but no where in the tiny book does it discuss honesty. Suppose the person is a miserable excuse for a human being? What should one put in his bucket then? People who tend to be negative and mean will not read it, the rest of us already practice what it preaches."
1,Absolute Pablam,One of the least rewarding three-hour reads I can recall. Sentimental love note to the founder of Positive Psychology from grandson that uses one elementary metaphor to teach one pricinple that is intuitively obvious: People/employees benefit from being praised instead of berated and criticized. Gallup organization should be embarrassed for their association with this puffed up lightweight treatment of the Strengths literature. Amazon.com and others who promote the work as something substantial should be exposed for selling sugar-coated baby food.
1,"You Have Got To Be Joking, right?","At the risk of dipping from the author's buckets, I have to say that this book ranks amongthe worst that I have read so far this year. Most of the book is spent on selling us that praise and compliments improve everyone's lives, performance etc, inclusing the giver of that praise. Hello...is this new to anyone out there? So then I look for the five ""strategies"" for increasing positive emotions, and we get revelations like ""Make Best Friends"" and ""Prevent Bucket Dipping"". Do yourself a favour if you have ordered this book - send it back as I have done and trade it for ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"". That book is a classic and says it all so much better, with much greater wit and originality."
3,How Full is Your Bucket...Positive Strategies for Work and Play,"I was just disappointed that the CD was not in the back cover of the book, otherwise it was in great condition."
4,"Hard to put down, even if you know the historical ending!","This book is the third in Plaidy's Tudor series. It is painful to read of Queen Katharine's heartbreak over her inability to produce a son and heir for the increasingly tyrannical Henry. Plaidy's simple writing style is necessary to help readers follow the complex ""tangled web"" of court intrigues. Read Antonia Fraser's _The Wives of Henry VIII_ for the straight history, then Plaidy's novels for the fictional ""inside scoop!"""
3,Not Jean Plaidy's Best,"As a dedicated Jean Plaidy (Victoria Holt) fan, I looked forward to reading this book about Henry VIII and the turmoil surrounding his love affair with Anne Boleyn. However, inasmuch as the story is told from the perspective of Catherine of Aragon, the storyline was filtered, and we didn't get a first-hand look at the protagonists. Additionally, the book was missing the wealth of information usually associated with Plaidy."
4,Great spotting scope. Good value,Prompt and timely delivery. Not very friendly UPS delivery (dropped box in front of house and left)
5,Super comfortables!,Received the package in time. I'm already using them. Thanks to everyone who made it possible.
3,Caramels not fresh,The caramels arrived quickly but were not soft when unwrapped. It seems like they were not fresh. I was disappointed and would not have bought them if I had known they would not be fresh.
1,Don't buy these. They just doubled the price.,"On May 24th, I bought this item for $28.99. Today, the price for the same product is $58.89. I have no idea how they can justify doubling the price overnight, but if you pay the $58 you are paying way too much.As to the product itself, the caramels are tasty and everybody likes them, but the last box they sent was stale.Time to look for a new source."
3,singing cowboy film,"Eddie Dean had a far better singing voice than most of the Singing Cowboy stars but they gave him rather poor movies to be featured in, for younger audiences than Roy Rogers or Gene Autry. Scripts were really weak and I just don't think Eddie Dean good as Star and Hero, not luike Roy, Gene, Tex or Rex. This film is ok but not much more."
4,IT WAS A GIFT.,MY FATHER IS REALLY ENJOYING THE MOVIES THAT I GAVE HIM FOR CHRISTMAS. HE SAID THEY ARE GOOD TO HIM.
5,good date movie.,"i got old boy first and then i got lady and mr vengeance after the fact. mr vengeance was very disturbing. the fact that the main character was deaf and dumb really made me feel frustrated at times. i found myself yelling at the tv ""turn around! look! look behind you!"". it was very well executed. he was trying to do good but things went terribly wrong. the tragic irony of the whole situation made my stomach hurt. it was awesome. just writing this review makes me want to watch it right now. if you like great movies with twists, turns, and a mess of blood check it out. you have to get old boy, and lady vengenace too. they are a series but they arent related. there are some references in the movies that youll pick up on which is cool. its like...korean kevin smith only really really good."
3,I was not impressed,"I became a fan of the director after watching ""old boy"" mostly because of the style he shot that film such as mixing humorous, yet gruesome, fight scenes with a mild twist near the end..However, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, the first of the trilogy, had none of which made ""old boy"" a classic in korean cinema.. although i can't recall the exact details of the story since i watched it over an year ago, i do remember that the movie lacked a common theme upon all well-made movies have: good vs. evil.. clearly the directors intention was for the audience to be sympathetic to both parties.. but doing that for the entire duration of the movie was tiresome.. i guess i can't live without the typical plot of good defeating evil as always.."
4,Vengeance is whose?,"Betrayed by black market organ dealers, a man (Shin Ha-kyun) kidnaps the daughter (Han Bo-bae) of a company CEO (Song Kang-Ho) in order to earn money to save his ill sister (Lim Ji-Eun). This sets a complicated web of revenge in motion that is catastrophic for all concerned.This is the first part of Park Chan-Wook's Vengeance trilogy. It effectively portrays both the futility of seeking vengeance and the raw pain that motivates it. An extraordinary film."
3,Doesn't Measure Up to Oldboy,This movie's just ok. I watched it a while ago; after watching Oldboy I decided I had to go and get this movie...and compared to Oldboy I was a bit disappointed. Not that its a terrible movie or anything but its not on the same level. The plot is interesting enough but the characters involved are not. The movie drags at times and I didn't feel for the characters in the movie like I did in Oldboy. To me thats what really sets them apart; that factor gives Oldboy a much more gut wrenching effect which is lacking in Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Still though...I'm waiting for Lady Vengeance.
1,NOT THE JAPANESE SERIES,"I just would like to thank the person from Seattle, WA who discovered that this DVD is NOT the one that airs on the Food Network, which is what my husband and I LOVE. Like the reviewer from Seattle, I agree that Amazon should provide more information regarding DVD because I would have been seriously upset to receive what I thought was the Japanese version only to see William Shatner - yuck."
1,"How about a little information, Amazon?!?","I'm not criticizing the VHS/DVD; I haven't yet seen it. What bugs me is the fact that I was ready to order an Iron Chef video, but not until Checkout did Amazon.com bother to add the phrase ""with William Shatner"" to the product description, which gave me sufficient pause to hit the ""back"" button and read these reviews. Now I realize it's NOT the original Japanese TV series. Is this a case of your Marketing Department once again overcoming honesty and forthrightness? You're really no different from any other snake oil salemen, are you?"
5,Fono where are you?,"Ok, this CD was released in 1999. That's four years ago. The question I'm left asking is, Fono, where are you?!This CD is truely awesome. At the time of it's release, before I heard it, I thought they were just another band released to sell off the uprising of rock. I was greatly mistaken. To me, this album is best described as ""catchy."" When I first got this CD, I was headed back home on a five hour roadtrip. I can honestly say that I was listening to two CD's the whole time. This one, and ""40 Acres,"" by Caedmon's Call. The two sound nothing alike for those wondering. Anyway, I listened only to those two, and on that trip I listened to the Caedmon's Call CD once through. The rest of the trip was Fono and only Fono.My advice is this. Click above and listen to the samples. If any little part sounds good, buy the CD. Any parts you don't like will grow on you."
4,fono is great ....,"I saw fono in concert, not knowing what to expect. They put on a energetic, good show. Their style is nothing exceptional. But their over-all sound and delivery is good. For a band's first cd, I say it's pretty good. If you like radio head, beck and other british pop bands, this is a good alternative. I bought it after the show and I was surprised. The songs are easy to understand and the vocals are good. I recommend this one to buy, it rocks !"
1,Disturbed Woman,"I could not finish this book since it was obvious that the main character Robyn needed some intense psychological therapy. I can understand her being hurt and deeply embarrassed by the cruel rejection she received at Clay's hands at the tender age of sixteen. However, it was just a kiss and some heavy petting - just one incident. To hang on to the hurt for twelve years is very unhealthy to say the least! And to have Robyn hang on to anger and hurt for almost the entire book is just plain boring and frustrating for the reader. Do yourself a favor and skip this book."
2,Grate rusted after one winter...had to sand and spray paint it,"Grate rusted after one winter. Flimsy plastic weather cover, ripped open at the top in many spots, and did not make it through the winter.To restore it myself, I first used a very stiff wire brush to sand down heave rust spots, then used an electric sander to sand off the general rust around the periphery of the grate (both inside and out), than spent $5 for a can of heat-resistant black spray paint made for radiators and fireplaces. I sprayed the entire grate. It looks new now. Don't spray paint the grills (if they got rusted) if you want to try this, for obvious health reasons. You can sand down the bottom grill for wood and it will be fine left as is. You can replace the cooking grill, if it got rusted, at any Home Depot or hardware store. The job took me a little over an hour, and with a better quality outdoor vinyl cover I bought, this fireplace-grill should last me another 4 years."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this fireplace and like the previous review, after a few weeks out in the elements, it is becoming a rust bucket. I actually contacted Coleman and believe it or not, they informed me that this fireplace was not meant for hot fires!! It's a fireplace for goodness sake! They said they were also going to send me replacement parts for those that had rusted off, which I never received. So, stay away from this Coleman product. Take your money and buy something more expensive that won't rust, fall apart and leave rust marks all over your patio. I would have rated this zero stars but it isn't an option!"
3,Dissapointed with Amazon/Coleman due to Product Defects,"We were very disappointed with several manufacturing defects of the Coleman Fireplace shipped to us by Amazon. We waited to unpack the product until we had haulted it 100 miles to our campsite. When we assembled the fireplace, pretty much in the dark, we noticed several significant defects in the base bowl of the fireplace. The rim of the bowl was slightly bent (could have been dropped in shipping), as was the adjustable vent, but the bowl also has several very obvious manufacturing defects which are round starbust indentations (about 1"" each) on the lower bowl. They almost look like the finish exploded so the metal is exposed and the unit will likely deteriorate more rapidly than it should due to these defects. After hauling the unit all those miles, assembling it in the dark, etc., we've decided not to return the unit to Amazon due to the hassle factor, but we're clearly disappointed in the condition in which this fireplace arrived."
4,A good overview of their career,The Ike & Tina Turner Story 1960 to 1975 (3CD - Time Life): Most of their greatest works (plus some individual stuff) along with a concert. This may not be a perfect set but it covers their work nicely. Probably the only one you will ever need.
1,Dissapointed,"Wanting to buy the best 2 way radio I could find, I was dissapointed in the sound quality of the Motorola 280. Even within close proximity, the sound was ""buzzy"". Not what I would expect for units costing $120 each. I'm so dissatisfied that I'm going to return them and try another brand. I have used some cheap (less than $40 each) radios from Radio Schack and the sound was much clearer."
5,"Note to ""An electronics fan"" who wrote ""Disappointed""","The buzziness you heard is due to close range. TalkAbouts interfere with eachother at ranges below 20ish feet. If you hold them next to eachother to test sound quality, you will be disappointed for sure - in fact, it says so in the manual! Beyond that range, they are the clearest radios I have ever used."
3,Not a Genuine DJ Shadow Album,"As mentioned on the Quannum Records web site, this is not an authentic Shadow album but is, in fact, a mash-up created by an unknown.""A few weeks ago, Solesides mentioned about the DJ Shadow bootleg ""Live in Bangkok"". Note that only the first 18 minutes of this release are mixed by DJ Shadow.Once again we need to tell you not to buy it. This is what Shadow himself says about this bootleg;""It's basically a mix I did for the BBC in late '99 or early '00 along with someone else's jazz music (?) Now people are putting anything on a CD and saying it's me. This is exactly what they did to Hendrix after he died throughout the '70s. It sucked then and it sucks now.-Shadow"""
1,THIS IS AN ILLEGAL BOOTLEG,The money you spend on this does not go to the artist. Might as well download it for free. AMAZON IS BREAKING THE LAW BY SELLING THIS.
5,I really loved the book.,"Great novel, I read it in a day. For the time travel part i sugest that the author ispire herself from Connie Willis-Doomsdaybook(historians from the future discover time travel and used to witness historical events)."
2,Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled... avoid this book!,"The author struggles with her own language and butchers the Scots dialect, making the whole thing painful to read. She confuses verb tenses and inserts oddities like ""delicateness"" in place of delicacy and ""clearness"" in place of ""clarity."" Her Scots speak a bizarre mix of modern American and British English overlaid with the couple of words most Americans associate with Scotland. Modernisms like ""okay"" don't faze them at all. But the worst of it was when they started tacking ""ye ken?"" onto the ends of their sentences like valley girls. They're cartoon characters, not real adults living in a real world."
3,Time Travel,I will most likely read books from this author again. I enjoyed the plot though a bit unusual in its history.
4,Good Product,My dogs love them and seem to be more energetic since taking them.The best thing is they are easy to give since they are chewable.
5,My dog loves these and so do I!,"My dog is on a grain free, premium dog food and I like these vitamins because they round out her nutrition requirements, keeps her system in balance, and is a good all around supplement."
5,Eco Quest 2,"In the wake of the tremendous success of the original Eco Quest: The Search for Cetus, Sierra has decided to follow up with a sequel.In Eco Quest 2: Lost Secret of the Rainforest, you play the role of Adam Greene who, along with his father Noah - doctor of ecology, arrives in a country in the middle of the rainforest in order to make some ecological studies.After having seperated from his father, Adam must venture into the rainforest, discover the secret of the mysterious Forest Heart and find the lost City of Gold in his pursuit of a remedy for the Grove People."
3,Bunny Brown & His sister sue,The information provided didn't disclose how worn the front really was.Otherwise the rest was OK>
2,Dissappointed,"I have been a music junky since my early teens (I am now 41). After coming to know Jesus personally, I was hungry for high quality musicianship that came from a Christian perspective. I have been challenged spiritually and musically by bands like Daniel Amos, The Choir, the 77's, and Undercover. Unfortunately this album does not quite go the distance like ""Forum"" did. The recording is well done and the sound is also very good, it just does not seem like the boys put their hearts into this project.The songs are strained and the melodies are weak. I have not given up however, and will be listening carefully to the next project that Undercover puts out."
4,A solid disc...,"I just listened to this disc for the first time in about two years. ""Svper Terram"" and ""Heaven Forbid"" are two of my faves. Overall the album is lighter than previous discs, but this is still a great album."
4,I like it but it is too short,"Legs should have been at least 2 inches longer, as it looks too short in my living room...I will see what I can do, but due to the amount paid, I hate that I have to try to fix the problem"
3,Too little for the money,"While it is an interesting listing, there is little description or any other information about the companies or bottles in this small booklet."
2,Not too good,"Bought this item for shooting but it'a only accurate within 200 yards. Past that mark, you're on your own ..."
5,it's the absurdity that keeps me coming back,"this album highlights the best of early dj shadow and dan the automator. hip hop electronic beats with solid interesting melodies. don't expect true ""world music"", but open your mind to the creative expressions of a handsome boy modeling school graduate and one of the hippest djs still kicking it. the little absurd sound bytes make me smile every time. if you've ever caught a preview of a mainstream indian movie with the singing and dancing or the silly low budget 70's ""blackspoitation"" movies, then you might find this album appealing. if you're a fan of dj shadow or the automator, then this album is a must."
2,Niched ephemera,2 1/2Uniquely fused concept does not have nearly enough compositional mileage to rise above background-intensive levels.
1,Not worth the money,"Having spent some time with Bollywood soundtracks from the idian retailer of trust, I was quite curious about this compilation.But it was a disappointing experience: Apart from the indian songtitles and the intros this CD has not too much to do with indan film music. It sounds [inferior] (The quality of the songs, not the recordng) and not very authentic.Try Bally Saggoo's Bollywood flashback, which might not be pure film music but is genuinely Indian!"
2,Not what I expected..,"I thought I was going to hear reel tracks from low budget Bollywood flicks. Instead I get tainted reinterpretations of these songs. I guess I was expecting something like a compilation like the DEEP NOTE series, not a DJ remix."
3,Maus,"Maus was a very engaging book. From the beginning I was pulled into the story. Maus is written in a very unique way. Art Spiegelman drew the Jews as mice, the Nazis as cats, and the Poles as pigs. Art Spiegelman told the story from the perspective of his father telling the story through an interview format. It is written in the form of a graphic novel. It is an interesting way to learn about history during the World War II era. Overall I liked this book, except I really didn't like the end. Also, there was a little bit of language."
5,great book,Received product much sooner than expected; quality was great and nothing broken. Was exactly what I expected with no problems. Was a gift and arrived on time.
5,Outstanding graphic novel on the Holocaust,"Spiegelman's portrayal of the Holocaust through a postmodernist point of view is outstanding. Don't let the term graphic novel fool you or turn you off by thinking its a comic book and is for children. It's not. The retelling of one of the most horrific events in modern history by having humans replaced with animals (ie., mice are the Jews, Cats are the Nazis, etc.) allows even the most uneducated person on the Holocaust come to terms with its stark and dense reality. Both Maus I and II are a must read and leave you with a haunted feeling on why did this have to happen?"
5,Maus.,"""Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History"" was an amazing read. I recently read it for an assignment in my freshman writing class and normally when I am assigned a book, I never finish it because it is boring; I could not put this book down! I loved how the characters were all animals because it made it easy to understand the authority of the characters. There were a couple different ways to interpret this story. You could either enjoy the story about the history of the Holocaust when Art's father is filling him in on it or you could enjoy the story of a father and son trying to repair their relationship by unfolding the father's past. The mix of the two stories keeps your mind busy and interested at all times. The story all together is very powerful and I would recommend that everyone read it."
5,Wonderful,"I read both these books when they first appeared and have continued to enjoy them ever since. A vivid, accurate, human account of the Holocaust. Not reading these two books will leave any examination of the Holocaust incomplete. Wonderfully done, in an engrossing and fast paced style.Quick Comment to the reviewer(s) who gave 3 stars: Your grasp of the English language (or total lack thereof) is amazing. The books were in no way fanciful, as implied, and a little careful reading would clear up your ignorance."
5,Amazing!,"This is a fantastic way to understand the holocaust. This makes such a terrifying and daunting subject approachable, but no less real despite the characters as mice, cats, dogs, and pigs. It was a very touching story, but also very funny, which is important to a tale that will stick with you for the rest of your life."
4,Deceptively simple,"Deceptively simple, this quick-read of a little book punches you in the gut with it's factual depiction of events lived through during World War II in Poland.It doesn't seek your sympathy, which is what makes it so powerful.The lesson of this chapter in human history must continue to be discussed - in this unusual form - and in every way - as long as survivors walk this earth.Any and all of us have the potential to victimize and/or be victimized."
5,Maus brings the Holocaust experience to a human level.,"I happened upon Maus in the public library and was instantly captivated. Mr. Spiegelman has written down his family's experience in a way that is touching, heartwrenching, and compelling. I look forward to using this book in my work as a child therapist, with adolescents. The format will capture their interest in a way history books cannot. This contribution to literature is especially important now, considering the resurgence of white supremacist propaganda."
5,Clever and Amazing,"I thought the book was extremely clever and well done. Once you start reading, you are hooked!!! This unbelievable story has you holding your breath. I reccomend this book to everyone!!!!"
5,Takes comics to a whole new level,"This book is a comic book, and it won the Pulitzer Prize. ""Why? How?"" It won for a reason: it is a fresh account of the much discussed World War II Holocaust, told from a single (real) person's point of view. The main character (Art Spiegelman's father) is Jewish, and so is represented by a mouse. Nazis are cats. The mouse (barely) survives a sentence in a concentration camp. The fact that the book is in comic format with personified animals allows you to absorb the story and it's gruesome details quickly and painlessly until you understand the magnitude and reality of it. Then you are overwhelmed, and the book explodes into powerful work of human experience."
5,"Maus is amazing, but how did I get here from Rhetoric?","I've read this book, it is amazing. If you like graphic novels that may change your life or way of seeing the world just go ahead and click buy.How did I get here though, one step away from Rhetoric? I think we are seeing an algorithm jam! Get out on the river and clear this mess up!"
4,reading Maus,I can't say how the book was since it was never sent to me. I requested a review of my account and received not information at all. I would recommend that you not order from this company.
3,what i thinkl,i think the book was alright i had me thinkin what was goin down back then. i think that i would tell other ppl to read it. it shows how the jews where treated. and it show the meaning of how u had to get though with all of the times that had happend. im DeLonzo and i would recamend this book to other kids and adults.
3,It gave a good idea of personal experiences during the war.,"The book was interesting & different since it was all written in a comic book format. I think it gave a good perspective of the events that one person went through during the war. I think it ended really abruptly & left the reader wondering what happened next. Like what happened to Vladek after the war was over? It gave a good comparison of the personalities between Vladek & his son Artie. Their personalities show the contrasts of some one from today & someone from the time of the war. Vladek was old fashioned & tried to get Artie to understand his views, but Artie was more modern & didn't think that he should act as if the war was still going on. All n' all it was a fast pace reading, because of the way it was written, and held my interest."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL READERS GREAT AND SMALL!,"Maus is Incredible. You learn so much about the holocaust but it is done in a form that all readers young and old can learn so much. I'm in 8th grade and I wouldn't be as inspired if it were in book form. It is a comic, a novel, a memoir, a biography and a history book all at the same time. Believe me, one reader to another you will be inspired to learn more about the independant comic world, you will be shocked at what the jews must do and you will marvel at the amazing yet simplistic art of Maus. I garunntee! A MUST READ!"
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"I recently picked up a copy of Maus from my local book store and when I started to read it I could not put it down. If finished it in less than a day. Maus is easily the best book I have ever read, and I have read many books. Everybody should read a copy of Maus. Maus is touching, exciting, and captivating all in one. There is no reason why I would not recommend Maus to anybody. I give it five stars and if I could I would give it ten. I recommend Maus to anyone who enjoys reading about history and even to those who do not."
4,A quick and easy read,"I bought this product and then later found both Maus I and Maus II, together in one book and for the same price, at my school bookstore. I would recommend buying both in one package to save money.It is a well told story and is worth the read. I would recommend ""American Born Chinese"" if you like the style of this book."
1,What a strange book!,"This Everyman edition, edited by Peter Washington, for some reason omits almost all of Hardy's most well-known and admired poems!NOT in this edition: Channel Firing, The Convergence of the Twain, Nature's Questioning, A Confession to a Friend in Trouble, Her Death and After, Are You Digging on my Grave, The Ruined Maid, Hap, The Impercipient, and A Broken Appointment. All of the Wessex Poems are missing, as well.I can't see what possible harm would have been done by including these poems! As it is, you're better off with the Dover edition -- this cannot be your only collection of Hardy poems, because the editor left out all the good stuff!"
3,Passtrak Series 7 text review,"Overall, I was generally pleased with the Passtrak Series 7 set. However, the answers and the respective page references to the end of chapter questions (not the Q & A book) did not always match up to the specified page. Like numerous others that I know who have taken the exam, I found the text did not cover a significant amount of the material in sufficient enough detail. The actual exam had questions that could not be found or referenced in the Passtrak text. In addition, the details of some exam questions exceeded the detail offered in the text. I passed the exam, but disappointed with the amount of material that was missing from the text that I was presented with on the exam. I do feel that one could find more than enough accurate material in the Passtrak Series 7 set to pass the exam if good study habits are employed."
4,A Good Value,I am 1/3 thru this book. It appears to be well organized with sufficient info needed to pass the series 7 exam. There are sample questions at the end of each chapter which appear very helpful. The book also provides guidance on how to handle trick questions. It also has helpful general tips on testing techniques.
4,Did the trick,The Passtrack 7 book is used by several bulge bracket firms to prep for the 7. The book is adequate and does the trick just fine. Anyone with a modicum of intelligence who studies the manual will have no problem.
2,"Ok, but some info is 100% wrong","This book is ok. Certainly if you study it, you will pass the Series 7 exam.However, some of the info is simply wrong. For example:""Stock dividends are frequently paid by companies that wish to reinvest earnings for research and development. Technology companies, aggressive growth companies, and new companies are examples of companies that are likely to pay stock dividends."""
2,Don't Believe Them,"I understand that taste is relatively subjective, but the previously unanimous five star rating is ridiculous. I appreciate slower moving art films, and I give slack to low budget indie films. However, this film is poorly acted--I, a non-actor, could have done better, the editing and cinematography is confusing and awkward, and the plot is virtually non-existent. The characters are flimsy and leave the viewer apathetic to their lives. This film could and should have been reduced to a 10 minutes short film. I almost think that this is someone's psychology experiment. Make a bad film on purpose, give it great reviews, and see what happens. As I'm writing this the film ends with the cliche: ""...but that's a story for another time."" Absurd.The only reason I don't give this movie one star is the recognition that my repulsion of this narcissistic drivel could have been exacerbated by its outlandish reviews."
1,This Movie Sucks (Not in the Good Way),"This movie is a complete waste of time. I am pissed that I wasted money renting it. I couldn't bring myself to give a damn about the main character because he was so dead pan. The acting and editing in theis film leav a lot to be desired. If you are interested in gay films that feature men of color check out Rag Tag, Finding Me, PUNKS(If you can find it) but trust me, this movie will only piss you off because of how pointless it is."
2,I want more from a movie,"I really wanted to like this movie. The actors were hot enough, but none were really portrayed with more than a quick brush. The main character was confused and sad...I get that...but the never ending reminiscences are just dumb. To have a real movie, they should have had the plot actually go somewhere or have an ending. Instead, you leave the movie where it began, the sad and confused break-up boy. Ho Hum. At least the cinematography was pretty good, and the co-starring role of San Francisco was well captured."
2,No Rebound,"This movie was semi-interesting, and predictable. I began watching it, I was distracted with other tasks, came back to the movie, and did not miss a beat. The lead character was annoying, and I felt the actor was struggling with the dialogue."
1,Rebound,"If you have trouble falling asleep, this dvd will put you out before the beginning credits end. Horribly horribly BORING!!!!! It doesn't even appear realistic to life let alone all the whining the main character does. He turns away some real hot guys to enjoy a period of whine whine whine. BORING!!!!!"
1,A waste of my friday night!,"This was not a good movie, at all! I felt so bad for the actors because they had no script or plot to work with. I really wanted to see Christopher end up with someone! I'm so sad I even wasted my time, Over-all the movie was pointless, and not to mention: boring as hell.........Two thumbs all the way down!!!"
2,OK,It is only OK. Plese do NOT pay to see this movie. You will feel if thought you have been raped with NO outcome. It is neither good or bad - just worst.
1,str8 Garbage,This movie was filmed on a cheap camcorder the actors suck and the story is unrealistic a waste of $1.99 plus the hour of my time I spent watching it
1,girl!,"this movie is a mess! i so wanted to enjoy this movie but it had nothing to keep me from leaving the room. we all had heart break at one point in time in our lives, but to make a two hour movie crying over it. please! the acting is bad, and the scene are very boring! i would like a refund!"
1,My finger can do better acting...,"Worst piece of shit movie I have ever seen. Do you know what I could have bought with $1.99? Perhaps a more worth-it snack bar. Or how about a kid in Africa who needs water to survive each day. But no, I just had to watch this piece of shit movie. Lord have mercy, as if the acting wasn't bad enough, the actors are the most unappealing. If my review has not been harsh enough, then I truly do apologize from the bottom of my heart."
1,Definitely not worth more than a 1 star movie,This is not a good movie. I think the director shot about 40 minutes of footage and then turned it into a 90 minute movie. Some of the acting was really bad and the story was incoherent. And I myself didn't find it sexy at all.
1,What the Hell was that!,"I have never seen a movie that was as bad as this one. The acting was awful, the plot noexistent, and the 20mins I spent watching this movie was wasted. I never felt as cheated out of a movie as I did with this.... this waste of time and money. Maybe I'm not sophisticated or artsy enough to get into this movie but oh my God, please in this day and age of reality tv, and web-based movies and series make a movie that's worthwhile or don't do it at all. Ok I'm off my soapbox now!! Ok just one more thing.... the person who developed this movie, and the person or persons who paid for this to be made should be tourted to death while this movie is playing in the background. Ok now, I'm through...."
2,Sorry..,I wanted to like this but I was bored and couldn't have cared less about the characters. I can't recommend it.
5,Very nice,Solid product. Matched counters well and works great! I'm very pleased with the colander. One of the best I've owned.
3,It works for the price.,"I was using a mesh strainer and was tired of getting pieces of pasta stuck in it, so I bought this colander. Overall it's good. It seems solidly built. The edge around top of it is a little sharp so you may want to be careful."
5,colander,I just got this colander in the mail and it looks like a well constructed colander and easy to clean. I do however with I had payed closer attention to the advertised dimensions because it is smaller than I wanted.
4,"Nice colander, but hold it right!","This granite colander has been in use for a couple of months in my house. We got it as a replacement to the plastic alternative that broke when we were colanding (?) some ravioli. We got this one, which is a little pricy, as a more permanent replacement. We have been pleased with the results up to now. However, the colander has no insulation for the rim so if you use it for hot items, remember to use a mitt!"
5,Virtuoso Trumpet,"Absolutely beuatiful, brilliant and altogether enjoyable listening. I want to be able to play like this!"
5,insane!,"If you like ""Bleeding through, as i lay dying, the red chord, between the buried and me"" and all those types of insane metal bands youll enjoy It Dies Today just as well. Expect the unexpected with this album. The breakdowns, the harmonics.... it all fits in great in one big smash of insanity. two thumbs up in my oppinion.Its GREAT stuff!!!"
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"WORKS'GREAT, NO PROBLEMS,NOT EASY TO INSTALL,YOU NEED ELECTRICAL EXPERIENCE. (IN MY OPINION)"
1,TECH SUPPORT IS A JOKE,"TECHNICAL HOTLINE IS A JOKE. I HAD ALL WEEKEND TO INSTALL BUT COULD NOT GET IN TOUCH WITH ANY TECNICAL SUPPORT. WAITED ON PHONE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME ONLY TO BE TOLD TO LEAVE A VOICE MAIL. NO ONE EVER RETURNED MY CALLS. WAS TOLD THAT MY CALL WOULD BE RETURNED WITHIN 24 HOURS. ITS BEEN 6 DAYS STILL NOTHING. THE INSTRUCTIONAL DVD THAT CAME WITH THIS PRODUCT WAS BROKE SO NOW I AM STUCK WAITNG ON THEM. SO I REALLY CANNOT COMMENT ON HOW WELL THIS PRODUCT WORKS, ONLY ON HOW POORLY BULLDOG THINKS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEY GOT MY MONEY NOW THEY DO NOT CARE."
5,Must have !,Super sticky post it notes work much better than your regular post it notes because you can use them for so much longer and repost them so many times. I use them all the time.
5,Remarkable Help,My mother had been reading this book for informational purposes and It just so happens around that same time my IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) started to become a real problem I went to the docters and they tried a few medications but never gave me anything for the pain (which had become unbearable) Mom had started with the lemon drinking and had me do it to from the day that I started drinking the lemon water I stopped having the pain altogether We called Mr. Thomas who then told us that if I stayed with it that the IBS would clear up. I still don't have any pain and in the meantime I am loosing wiat which is a wonderful thought for me
5,a teenage Mozart spreads his wings!!!,"I am collecting this entire series one CD at a time. The notes state that Mozart wrote these lovely symphonies at the ripe old age of 16 and 17. Each symphony is filled with joyous and exuberant melodies. Mozart composes these symphonies with a youthful relish and it is obvious he is spreading his musical wings. If you love music filled with stirring melodies juxtaposed by elegant and delightful slow movements and then alternated with graceful dance-like movements, you will love this disc. Mozart, as always, is so perfect... even as a teenager. This is music that can be enjoyed again and again. And yes, Symphony 21 is a youthful masterpiece!"
2,Skimming the surface,"Cramming the life of Ulysses S. Grant into thirty minutes is impossible and insulting to the memory of a great American. This documentary barely skims the surface and relies upon hackneyed legends and common stock photographs, which they use over and over again.There is no detailed explanation of Grant's rich private life or family, his astute and brilliant generaliship during the Civil War or his flawed Presidency. The narrative limps along, omitting major events in Grant's life and boring the viewer in the process.If you want to discover Ulysses S. Grant, read some of the excellent biographies of him. He was a grand man with a fascinating life and this documentary doesn't begin to illuminate his heart and soul."
5,An Excellent Look Into the Life Of General Grant -A.D.,"This Movie Tells The Great Story Of The Life Of President-Generel-American Hero Ulysses S. Grant. It Tells about his backround, childhood, Army life,Marrage, life at Hardscrabble, Life durning the Civil War, Life as President, His trip Around the world, writing his memoirs,and his Death - Aaron R.Dodds"
3,"Not bad, but tracking is sub-par","This VCR isn't a bad unit, but the tracking control does not allow me to play tapes I've recorded on previously owned VCRs without serious jitters. It is fine with pre-recorded tapes, and sounds good with my surround sound setup."
4,Try it.........you'll like it,"Bought tried tested. A nice quiet operating vcr. All the listed features work to my satisfaction.Sometimes I'm hard to please.I give it 4 stars. One thing I notice is,when using reverse mode(while in play) it has to think if it wants to do that. It will.When power fails...No Problem. All stored memory is still there when power comes back.On screen programing is great and easy to use.I like it and think you would be happy if you had this unit."
4,Worthy Purchase,"I agree with most of the reviews on this page. Regardless of Microsoft's current/past practices (which have absolutely nothing to do with the credibility of THIS book), it gives a good background on security in many situations. The part I found most helpful were the 'How To's' sections. There are good real world examples that are straight to the point and easy to comprehend. I code in C# w/SQL Server and all examples in this book use that combination; PERFECT FIT!I would of bought this book just for the 'How To's' on hashing passwords and implementing roles with IPrincipal."
3,"Good info, but dated","I got the book for background information on ASP.NET security, so if you're looking for basic information it's a great resource."
2,I was very disappointed,"What I expected was a step-by-step book that got into the basics of building model aircraft. What I got was a collection of articles, some of them old, from Model Airplane News magazine. The articles are tips, organized by chapter on various topics, like ""wing building,"" ""building tools,"" etc.While some of the tips were useful, I think the title is misleading. Many of the articles weren't building techniques at all. And I was disappointed after reading it that I still didn't have a good feel as to what it takes to build a quality model airplane.Its an ok book for some of the tips, but don't buy it expecting a ""how-to"" book on building a model airplane."
2,Riped off,The price on the cover is $17.95 I paid$60 inc. del + service. I found this outraiges. I want repeat that again
1,RC AIRPLANE REFERENCE BOOKS RIP-OFF,"This 'Reference Book' shows a 'NEW' price of $592.90It shows a 'USED' price @ $75.87 and lower from there.If you would like to be 'DUMB' enough (LIKE I WAS) thinking you are purchasing the 'HOLY BIBLE' of R/C MODEL AIRPLANE TECHNIQUES (MINE WAS PUBLISHED IN 1991).............THAT'S THE BAD NEWS, THE REAL BAD NEWS IS THE PUBLISHERS SUGGESTEDRETAIL PRICE IS: $9.99!!!!!!!!!! (I paid almost $40.00 for mine and it wasn't even signed by either 'ORVILLE or WILBUR WRIGHT'.Save your money and go to a reputable HOBBY SUPPLY STORE and purchase a book that actually gives you information for R/C MODELING in at least the 19th Century. I'm not sure who does the pricing for these people, but they might want to take a READING & MATH CLASS.Tom Mullins"
1,Buyer Beware !!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS RING!!! IT LOOKS GOOD IN THE PICTURE BUT THE ACTUAL RING IS A CHEAP SMALLER VERSION OF THE PIX! TERRIBLE PIECE OF JEWELRY !
2,you pretty much get the $8.00 ring you pay for...,"After reading all the other reviews, I was thoroughly excited to receive this ring! However, when I got my ring there were several scratches on the ring, some were very dark scratches making them even more noticable. The design, size, & weight of the ring are great. Their customer service offered to replace the ring ONCE, but I chose not to risk getting a ring the second time that looks even worse. I am wearing the ring which obviously means it doesn't look completely awful. However, I cannot say I would recommend this...especially if you are gifting it to someone else!"
4,dont get bleach on it,it was super cute and i got really sad when i was doing laundry and got bleach on it. it turn black and i threw it away.
3,Sizes run small,"The ring has a good appearance, but it's at least a full size smaller than standard ring sizes."
4,Okay Peace Sign Ring,"This ring is ohkay... The band was thin but i don't think it is worth $13 dollars.But I like wearing it, i love the peace sign but it is also a little plain, i wasn't paying attention to these when i bought it but other then that,I love the Ring! Just wish i spent my money on other stuff,Sorry"
1,PEACE RING REVIEW,"I was so excited to recieve my ring after reading all of these reviews I thought that it was going to be axactly what I wanted, however when I got the ring I was not happy at all because the ring looks better online. The peace sign is so much smaller than on the picture it looks like it should be worn by a littlE girl and not by a women. I thought that the ring was going to be bigger based on the picture that I saw. I like jewlery that is noticeable and makes a fashion statement. I'm very diassapointed with this ring and I wish that i didn't buy it...."
3,reasonable cost,"This ring is small, but other than that, its reasonably cheap on price, not bad for the price. I'm happy with it."
5,I LOVE this ring.,"The ring is beautiful. I received it within days of ordering it. Overall, the value for the price was excellent. I'd order from this vendor again and I'd recommend them for any friend looking for silver jewelry."
1,Piece of crap. Not worth more than 5$,I bought this ring on Sept. 9th and got it on the 12th. So shipping was fast which I was very pleased about. I have been wearing this ring for only 3 days and the coloring is already rubbing off and it has now turned to an ugly copper color. I am very diligent about taking it off in the shower and while wetting my hands. If I would have known this was going to happen I would have returned it the next day. Not worth the money. Buyers beware.
2,Not a fan,Sorry to say I'm not a huge fan of Tanghetto even after seening them play live at La Viruta last month. Few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while. I say if you want neuvo tango try Narcotango or Otro Aires.
2,A conglomeration of meaningless noise,"After discovering and loving the sound of Gotan Project I was shopping around for groups with a similar sound. I stumbled along Emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd, I thought I had found another gem. Boy was I wrong. The first track drew me in and left me spellbound, unfortunately, it was all downhill after that. I was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on. The rest of the songs were so uninspiring, the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise."
1,Hall Of Shame,"This dirty old creep has been making billions and billions of cash over the years because of his smut magazines.He has helped to steal the innocence of many and thousands upon thousands of young women,all for his sleazy pleasure.This man is without a doubt,one of the most vile men ever to walk this earth.I pray,that he opens his eyes and repents of his sins before it's too late."
2,Imagine I Understand,"I read this book and had alot of problems comprehending it. I was suppose to writee a paper on it, and as I read, none of the words stayed with me. I tried to find a review of the book so that after reading it, I might be able to reread the book and keep the information inside. But I was not able to find a review of this book. So I will reread it again and hopefully this time, I will get something from it."
4,a must have for naomi's fan's,this book let's you look at naomi in ways you have never seen befor and shows you why she earns tens of thousands strutting on the runway. Twenty dollars is a very cheap price to see her the way you will in this book
1,"Et tu, Naomi?","Everyone seems to be trying to capitalize on celebrity these days, why should a model be any different? But rather than spill her heart out in juicy tell all, Campbell, obviously figuring there were not enough photographs of her in circulation, toots her own horn in this sappy, silly exercise in narcissism by publishing ""never-before-seen photographs"" of--who else?--herself! There is Naomi in Thailand, Naomi sans make up, Naomi with family. By the time we read about Naomi's friendship with Nelson Mandela (captioned, of course, under a photo of the two together--who says supermodels have no conscience?) we appreciate why these photos have never been seen before, and further, why they should never be seen again."
5,Excellent!,"From Planeta journal:An impressive first edition, not as much a tourist's guidebook as a naturalist's handbook. Color illustrations document native birds, mammals and reptiles. The author provides a brief eco-history of the region as well as background on environmental threats and conservation. Excellent!"
5,"Radical, deep ecological political thought in an accessible form-- inspiring!","This book paints a loving, yearning picture of an alternative industrial society in which aspirations of happiness, intellectual and spiritual growth, ecological sustainability, social equity, and --yes-- economic stability may be achieved through simple yet profound shift in values. The essays are deeply political and philosophical, but remain accessible to anyone who wants try and tackle the subject matter. The material is not light nor bombastic-- it is a stark reminder that current industrial societies are unsustainable, and with a human global population about to break the 7 billion-person mark, we had better make some changes, and soon. The inferences the reader may draw from this book are daunting. What is required for true, lasting change is not political or social reform, but a complete revolution of values. This is the good stuff."
4,A portable diablo game.,"This game is good for people who most likely to spend your hours hack and slashin' enemies and baddies, and love to see your character level up. Why I said this is a portable Diablo game, was because they have over 100 generated items, it's really fun to see your equip get stronger and stronger as you buy weapons/armor from the stores. If you are a gamer who likes a good storyline, I recommend you don't buy this, because this has a crappy story, you will not enjoy it, dialogs are slow, but if you are a gamer who likes to play, not caring about the story, this game is for you, 18 levels to beat up baddies, it can get repetitive going to the same dungeons with the dialog and all. I recommend this game to most people."
4,Shining through the Ages,"This game is heaps of fun. I could play for hours and hours and actually found myself doing just that. If you don't mind returning to town all the time to buy more health drops and to sell off extraneous items, this game is a must buy. The only qualm I had was that it seemed at times monsters could attack you from a diagonal but you couldn't hit them. Maybe just a bug or a quirk. Either way, fun, fun, fun. Finally, levels are easy to gain and the variety of weapons and items make the game a little more enjoyable."
2,How hard is it to find a leather belt?,"I have a belt buckle that I love, but it did not come with a belt. This was my second attempt to find a belt to go with the buckle. This one was actually better than the first attempt. However, it is stiff and has a layer of felt that falls off right away.I ended up going to J.C. Penney and buying a Levis leather belt with buckle and sticking the buckle in a drawer. It was more expensive, but at least I got a belt that will last."
2,Life of King David,"If you want a book about the life of David with detailed commentaries about what he did etc. perhaps using the Bible as well as other historical books then this is not the book for you. This book uses snapshots of David's life and then proceeds into a long, long exhortation about being a 'good, chosen' christain. Not what I was looking for and I find the tone overly sanctimonious and content judgmental."
5,great book for anyone wanting to move forward in God,"I just started to read this book. It gives encouragement and at the same time make you deal with yourself. I am only at the 3rd chapter.Even thou the title suggests it is for a ""man of God"", I think it is for everybody who really wants to move forward in God the right way."
4,Excellent book for personal growth,This book came quickly and was in good condition. Like new. The book itself is great! Am enjoying the insights of the author and growing from it. Everyone should read thisbook. Learning from the life of David has been stretching me and making me see how to trust and love God more.
4,Great reference book for all things beadweaving!,"This is really great book on beading and different from most of the books out there. Honestly, I will probably make only one or two of the projects listed as most of them are just not things I would ever want to make. Having said that.. this is the one book you will reference often throughout years. It has clear instructions for all the the stitches plus hard to find instructions for things like increasing and decreasing for all the various stitches and how to transition smoothly from one stitch to another. The pictures and instructions are very clear and easy to understand. It also discuses things like tension, etc and how this can vary depending on what you are making and whether the beadwork should be stiff or supple. Anyone looking for a great beading 'reference' should have this book in their collection.Whenever I have a project that uses a new stitch this is the book I grab for stitch instructions. Always clear and concise."
4,Get Ready To Bead!,"This was the first bead book I ever bought, recommended by bead artist Valerie Hector, and it got me on my way. Covering several of the basic bead stitches, the projects are gorgeous and will make you feel very successful when completed. The end chapter on combining stitches is a wonderful way to keep from feeling trapped with one style.The only down side is that there are some basic bits of information not included that would have really been helpful when trying to go on your own. Still, worth having in your collection."
5,Best book for learning...,"As mentioned above, this is not a book of patterns but it will teach you all basic techniques you could want. It is clear and easy even for a beginner. The pictures are also a great source of inspiration! Make sure to check out Carol Wicox Wells' newest book, which will take you from learning to creating!"
5,This is entertainment!,"The show is from the '70s but it continues to be wonderful to watch today! Television producers could learn much from the English producer. No one does television better than the Brits, so watch and enjoy!!"
5,Perfect !!!!,"Every note is clear and concise!!The tempo is perfect !! His attention to playing is entirely without flaw, defects, or shortcommings!His mastery of the Beethoven sonatas is unquestionable! His cycle of the Beethoven piano sonatas proves him as a musical potentate!Thanks John O'Coner ! This is how it should be played, not like a speed competition ! What technique and feeling !!The piano sound is exquisite. The tone, sustain, and reverb are as rich as the Telarc name!!I have owned this cd for over 20 years. Get the complete set of all 32 Beethoven piano sonatas on 9 cd's from Telarc and John O'Conor!In my opinionJohn O'Conner plays the Beethoven Sonatas the best.Murray Perahia plays the Mozart piano concertos the bestJorges Bolet plays the Liszt's ""Trancendental Etudes"" the bestPlease remember this is just my opinion. I do not seek, nor relish, hostile or vindictive animus from anyone.Good Day Friends !!"
4,Great arrangements of John Williams favorites,I really enjoy John Williams music and having a brass ensemble play some really great arrangements is fantastic. I would recommend this if anything for track 11 and 16. Fantastic John Williams pieces you do not hear often.
5,Best -PRACTICAL- Book on Candlestick Charting..,"Of all the candlestick books I've read, this is the best, most user-friendly, of all of them.Most candlestick books are written by academicians & other non-traders. As such, they are a waste of money.Hands down, this is the best candlestick book out there!"
3,No fault of his own...,"I thoroughly enjoy Michael Murray's style of playing and his interpretations of the great organ works he has committed to recording. It pains me, then, to see a recording such as this released on an INSTRUMENT that, while lauded as one of the greats, sounds painful at times through the duration of the recording. The tuning is at times, horrendous and blatantly displayed. I cite specifically track 3 on CD #1, The Piece Heroique (8:00 minutes) as a prime example of either this organ's apparent neglect or its simple lack of tuning. In short, my hesitation in buying the album would stem only from the aforementioned problems and not from the interpretation or performance. Why another organ could not have been used or why these problems could not have been rectified before the recording is beyond me."
4,Frank Masterworks CD,"This was what I expected. The sound is good, performance very good, and selection pretty complete. The recording is not recent however, which may have effected the sound."
3,Not loud enough,I previously used the Whistler 1730 which was much louder. This one has a brighter LED display but if the radio is on you can barely hear this detector. I much prefer loudness over brightness of the display. When I am driving I am not watching the display.
2,A Reference volume,"I am slightly disappointed in this publication as I expected to see more photographic examples. Illustrations of the work of these photographers are few and far between. But it is well written and thorough and, no doubt, useful for scholars. Just not so interesting for the regular lay person interested in the history of photography who needs the occasional image to keep the interest flowing."
4,Mark Bible Study is a Good One,"Mark is generally accepted as the first Gospel account written, probably 30 years or so after the death and resurrection of Jesus. Mark is generally considered by scholars to be Peter's close friend and learned the details of Jesus' teachings and life from Peter (and Peter's many sermons to fellow believers). Mark wrote his Gospel to preserve the teachings and events of Jesus' life.This Standard Bible Study is a handy reference to the study of the Gospel of Mark. The author discusses the book by chapter and sometimes by verse. Difficult verses are explained and understanding is gleaned.This is a good starting point for any student of the Bible who wants a basic bare-bones study of Mark. I found it worthwhile and a blessing to my spiritual life, and came away with a better understanding of Mark's Gospel. I recommend this study for the beginning student, although anyone who reads this study will most likely discover insights not previously realized.Jim ""Konedog"" Koenig"
3,akai did not work,"The Akai did not work, it looked like a pin was twisted. Rob told me that my son had damaged the pins by inserting his card the wrong way, my son who is 16 and technically very good with everything claims that the pin was twisted from the start.Rob is sending us a new one.This was a bad experience, next year I will shop from a store because this was his main present for Christmas and he was sad not to be able to use it. Thank you for your interest. Happy new=year. Best regards. Natacha Leighton"
1,Trash,"maybe i didnt know how to work this thing, or i got a faulty machine but i had to return it because i didnt like it. the pads were not responsive, unless i hit it extra hard buy reason 4.0 instead"
5,Great product and value for me,"I buy this and mix it with fruit or vegatable juices in my shaker blender bottle. It is finely ground, mixes well, tastes great. It is a quality product. I drink protein-juice shakes during the day instead of eating out fast food for breakfast or lunches. I am feeling great and losing weight. This price is 60% less than what I pay in my local supermarket buying in 1 lb can."
2,It's a beautiful case indeed..,"But unfortunately each time I screw in the motherboard into the case the PC will NOT turn on.. however if I take it out of the case it will.It's some kind of an electricity issue and because the case does NOT come with any manuals my experience is somewhat negative. I do not know whether it's the case's fault or my motherboard's fault. Either way, a manual would be nice.But yea.. it glows blue and has nice fans. It will fit 8800GTX, so if you're a gamer this case is OK-ed for you."
4,Delectable,"I could not put this novel down. As a one time Art History Major, the history lessons of the Faberge workshops dispursed throughout the story are absolutely fascinating. Not only that, but we the readers get to take a peek at what life is like for the young, beautiful, expelled royalty now living in America. What could be better than that?This book is a fine mystery wrapped up in a modern fairytale."
5,A splendid read!,"Every page of Object of Virtue is a beautifully written treat for anyone who appreciates a sophisticated, intelligent society mystery. If Dominick Dunne were a Russian aristocrat, you'd have ""Object of Virtue"". I'm recommending this book to everyone. It's fabulous. Run - don't walk to buy this book now!"
4,Great Book,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Wonderful background to Russian high society, Faberge and the displaced Russians in New York."
3,A Bit Shallow,"A nice story with great potentual. The charactor developement is a bit shallow. Sasha is almost unlikeable because of this. The history surrounding it is wonderful, and he places you in the story with his visual discriptions. I would definately read another book by this author. I believe that he will grow and bring his charactors to life. As a showcase for Faberge' and faded opulence, it is a very nice read."
3,"a good yarn, refined settings, and, pedestrian writing","Surprisingly, this turns out to be a pretty good yarn that picks up pace and will keep you turning pages toward the end, and you get to know some pretty well defined characters. And it heaps on the reader a crash course in Russian culture, the fabulous story of Faberge in particular, and Russian history, down to the present day almost. All that said, the writing is pedestrian with numerous cliches and irritating overly-literal timelines throughout (how many times does he have a character put down the phone, etc, as if the reader cares about such details). It sometimes seemed that the writer hadn't actually been to Russian in the 90's, the portrayal was so bright-line cliched about money spent by the new Russians. Finally, the writer cares a lot more about White Russians in the USA than I do."
2,Force user to pay $7.95 more for sample files,"The book does not include the sample files on a CD. The end user is required to go to the website. On the website, they are given the choice to download each individual sample file or to buy a CD for an additional $7.95 (for shipping and handling). If the $.50 CD had been included with the book, there would be no need to charge the customer for shipping and handling. Plus, when does it cost $7.95 to ship a CD? As for the book itself, it is okay. The pictures are in color, but they are just general instructions. They are not step by step instructions."
4,Good,I received my book on time and it was in the condition the seller stated it was overall I have nothing bad to say. Am happy with the product and the seller
2,Master P a good Actor????,"I'm not sure if ""the last don"" was a comedy or what. The story line and the characthers aren't even close to what the portray to be.There's no way I would consider Master P a good actor. Decent, maybe."
3,only worth your money if bought for cheap,"this is a double disc 2 movie edition. 1st is the da last don and its a good movie but its only 45 minutes long, but it has good quality to it. lots of girls, guns,and drugs.2nd disc is the im bout it which is an ok movie but the quality really sucks. it probally costs them only a couple thousand to make this film, not that good. overall i would pay no more than 10 dollars for the 2 dvd's."
4,Well-researched mystery,"While this book is a little slow to start (in terms of the mystery/murder), it more than makes up for it by beautifully establishing the main characters (Sister Frevisse, the nuns at the priory, the main villagers and the troupe of actors), and the time and place. The details of medieval life are seamlessly woven into this mid-winter tale, set in a small village. Once the mystery of just who killed the husband of one of the nuns' servants is introduced, the pace increases. When suspicion falls on the vagrant troupe, Sister Frevisse summons her considerable powers of deduction to help solve the crime. But when the body count starts to rise and Sister F learns the crowner is enroute to wrap up the case, she knows she must work hard to not only find the guilty party, but ensure an innocent person is not convicted.A nice, tight story for lovers of history and slow-moving, but well-plotted crimes."
1,Buyer beware!,"Be very careful when purchasing this item from Amazon. Due to an apparent glitch in their internal system, the Targus Repel backpack has somehow been linked to the Targus Revolution backpack. Amazon and many of their third-party sellers think the Revolution is called the Repel. As the owner of a Repel (purchase elsewhere) I can tell you it is a great product. However, when I attempted to purchase another one to replace mine that's starting to show some wear, I was shipped a Revolution instead. It has since been returned (still awaiting a full credit). Bottom line - contact the seller separately and verify what you will receive before placing an order!"
3,How to write clearly,"I was disappointed on the quality of the print. A few pages were blurred hard to read, some were suchHow to Write Clearly: Rules and Exercises on English Compositionlight ink was also hard to read."
2,poor quality,It is made with cheap cardboard and only lasted a few uses. It bends easily and is easy to tear.
3,Good performance but not great,"I had an older version on tape that I bought to replace with this performance. It is a good one, but not electrifying."
1,Horrible - DO NOT BUY!,"I was very excited to get my son a Lite-Brite (remembering how much I enjoyed the one I had as a child) and decided to go with this 'travel' model as a starter, to see if he would even play with it. Although he did enjoy the concept, and we do play with it when I have the patience, the actual toy is awful.Everything you read about how this toy is bad is in the other reviews (the absolute uselessness of the storage compartment, the inane functioning of the light); I suppose that its many negative attributes were not expressed in such a way as to make me appreciate how awful they actually are. I can think of two ways to explain the horribleness of this toy:Either, 1) The person who ""designed"" it never had a toy as a child is now taking revenge on the world, or 2) (the more likely case) this toy was not designed, but instead pieced together by somebody with some extra plastic parts. It is a parent's nightmare."
4,Ok,I got this toy for x-mas it took a long time to build but is very hard to get it to work it was frustrating building it and ever more frustrating when it broke. Plus it has a lot os parts which are easy to lose get a different toy like the lego mindestorm
3,OK but overpriced,Toy took about an hour to assemble.Is OK but not really educational other than learning to follow assembly instructions.Was too expensive for what it was.
3,Content issue,"I thought the product contains the videos uploaded on the YouTube with the same title 'Tango in the Night'. But alas, it turned out to be a concert. Seems like the wonderful versions on the YouTube are not for sale--'Everywhere', 'Gypsy', 'Stand Back', 'I can't wait', etc., on YouTube are just wonderful."
2,A Hole in the Puzzle,"This video is good only for those of us that are HUGE Fleetwood Mac fans. It is not something that proves the greatness of the band. Stevie's special close-ups are ridiculous! They distract from the concert, while making her seem vain and unconcerned with the music (which we all know is NOT true). Amusing points do come through, however. Behind the scenes footage of the band makes for some good laughs, and seeing Mick's drum solo during ""World Turning"" is highly entertaining. All in all, the band is just not the same without Lindsey Buckingham. He is sorely missed throughout the concert video."
3,"Stevie is Queen, Lindsay is missed!","Fleetwood Mac is the greatest band of all time. Although Stevie Nicks' voice sounded a bit strained, she was the highlight of the show. Lindsay Buckinghams' absence was a complete blow to the whole concert and Rick Vito and Billy Burnette should have stayed backstage. I found myself fast forwarding through everything they did. Thank god Lindsay has come to his senses and rejoined this timeless and ever-rocking band."
2,Not That Great,"I would recommend skipping this one and buying the album ""Tango In The Night"" (which is a great album!) instead. The quality of this DVD is pretty good. As for the contents of this DVD... well...let's just say I laughed when I saw it. It's just not the same sans-Buckingham and where the heck is ""Tango In The Night"" (and yes...I know it's Lindsey Buckingham's song)!? I only keep this DVD for the Stevie Nicks songs. I think that maybe they should have released a different concert over this one. Skip this one."
2,Fleetwood Mac sans Buckingham (Tango in the Night),"I agree with other's who reviewed this album (I have not viewed the DVD). In general, Fleetwood Mac is just another lackluster band w/o Lindsey Buckingham. Only time will tell if they survive the loss of Chiristine McVie. If they ever loose Stevie, I won't even bother to check out the releases of one of my favoites. Good luck, Mick, I'm pulling for you!"
2,The Mac abducted by aliens?,"This video reminded me of a lounge act trying to imitate fleetwood mac! I am a huge fan,seen them twice in concert. The overall feeling was that they were trying hard to get the concert over with. I do not know why they even bothered with ""Dreams"". It was very rushed. But ""Gold Dust Woman"" was excellent as per usual I must say. This concert did not seem ""Live"" though. I'm still Fleetwood Mac's #1 fan! I 've watched 'The Dance"", ""Stevie Nicks in Concert (1982)"", Stevie Live at Red Rocks"" and they are all sensational!"
1,vomit provoking,"I have never been a huge Lindsay Buckingham fan, but after watching/fast-forwarding this video I have a new found respect for the man. Fleetwood Mac is nothing but a third rate club band with the twin-like replacements rick and billy clouding the act. I find the two unendurable and am contemplating how to rid myself of this shameful display by may favourite band of all-time. Does anyone know how to copy over a write protected VHS?p.s. the three Stevie VHSs available through amazon.com are all worth buying, especially ""Stevie Nicks in concert 1982"""
2,Fleetwood Mac music for rehab members,"This video is perfect evidence of the downfall of the band after the departure of Lindsey Buckingham. The late eighties saw the band become a slick ""hair band"" with little to offer that was unpredictable. The set list from this 1988 concert filmed at San Francisco's Cow Palace sounds overproduced and anything but live. Moreover, the close-ups shots of Ms Stevie Nicks (that were redone months later after she was unhappy with her appearance) are downright comical. It's obvious they don't match the rest of the footage...What were they thinking. The long and senseless drum solo by Mick Fleetwood in ""World Turning"" is redundant and again, comical at best. Thank goodness, this wonderfal band redeemed itself with 1998's ""The Dance"" ( a much better buy). There is a God!! Skip this lemon and go for ""The Dance"""
1,Fleetwood Mac - Tango In The Night,"I am a 20-plus year FM & Stevie Nicks fan. A true die-hard lover of this band. But, WHAT WAS THAT! The Stevie close-ups were way overdone, not to mention the Stevie hair! FM had to use two men to replace the irreplaceable Lindsey Buckingham, and to no avail, it just is not the same. Although these men are clearly talented, Lindsey, they are not. Stevie Nicks sounds as if her voice is synthesized on every song, and she rushes through, ""Dreams"" like she has some other very pressing engagement. Attention Fleetwood Mac fans: PASS ON THIS ONE."
2,Fleetwood Mac Tango in the Night...just alright,"After having bought the Tango in the Night concert, I regret ignoring the reviews already posted saying it's not that good. It's not Fleetwood Mac at it's best, and the editing is very distracting. The Mirage or Dance concert are much better!"
3,Two for One,"I'll keep this brief. Fleetwood Mac is an awesome band, even when they're not at their best. It is important to note that it takes TWO lead guitarists (Billy Burnette and Rick Vito) to approximate the amount of music Lyndsey Buckignham makes by himself, and they don't equal it.About the video:The music is good - the vocals are good.BUTWhere the heck is 'Tango In the Night'? The title cut from the album isn't in the concert! This is supposed to be the 'Tango In The Night' tour - and they didn't play it!I'm confused..."
2,A chore to read,"I love WWII history, and being a former tanker myself, must have respect for these men and what they went through, but this book was just not enjoyable. Its incredibly repetative and quite absent of any sort of emotion. Really, its pretty boring. Go take a look at it in Barnes and Noble or whatever you have near you, and if you don't grow tired of hearing about T34 turrets being dislodged page after page, then order it online. Or support your bookstore. If you are looking for more interesting ground combat stories, I highly recommend Sniper on the Eastern Front, Black Eidelweiss, and pretty much any Ambrose or Ryan book. These seem quite likely to have been written in German, probably for progaganda use, and translated poorly over into English. I would love to say it was fantastic, but I grew bored with the writing style and lack of detail."
4,Up close and personal!,"As with many books of this particular genre, the subject matter is very interestingng, but suffers from translation. The six men, the ""Aces"", are well profiled and seem to become real people.In regards to the lack of ""technical details"", most readers of this very specialized type of biography/memoir/military history, can easily find the necessary information eleswhere. This book focuses on the MEN and not the equuipment.Overall a very good effort. A few maps would have helped understand the overall strategic situation, better, but still entertaining. Four stars reflect the translational problems, since German is dificult to translate into ""literary"" and readable English."
3,"Interesting, but could be better","I found this book interesting, but it sure could use some maps! It is hard to follow the flow of the text without them."
5,Eye Opening,"In the modern age, our generation seems content with the myth that the germans were easy to beat once the Americans arrived after the battle of Stalingrad. This book is truly one of a kind in its ability to bring the truth to light, and make one question the history/Military channel and their opinions on tank warfare of world war 2. There were dull parts, however, over all the book was an on-edge thriller that kept you guessing, especially if you had no backround information on individuals such as Kurt Knispel and Hans Bolter. The Stackpole series is one of my personal favourites when it comes to German Military History."
2,Too Much Preparation,"There is too much preparation for the activities in this book. It would be excellent for a physical education teacher who had much time to set up the activities, but for the ""normal"" person trying to create teambuilding, it is too compicated."
5,A Wonderful Story for Christmas!,"This is such a wonderful book! Every year I look for a special book to share with my family, this year it will be The Last Straw. It is a humorous tale that also teaches a valuable lesson about humility. The Last Straw is right up there with Santa Calls and The Red Ranger Came Calling. I highly recommend this book!"
5,The Last Straw,"The Last Straw is not only an amazingly well written and illustrated picture book, it is a tender Christmas story. It also ""illustrates"" the idiom ""the last straw"". I teach third graders this saying as part of the CK curriculum...the book is an invaluable resource. PLUS, it came via Amazon quickly, in super condition, and at an incredible savings....hooray!!!"
1,Buy Food or Music Instead,Gray Jacobik's The Double Task is terrible. Do not buy it--you'll only be wasting money on stock images and familiar rhetoric. Jacobik relies on the abstract and sentimental.
4,Basically it's like reading the movie w/ a tad bit more,"If you liked the movie the book is about 98% the same, if you didn't like the movie you won't like the book. The remaining two or so percent is how the story begins and ends. Overall pretty good but nothing major."
4,SPOOKTACULAR!!,a great easy reading spook story i read as a kid.setting is very imaginable and captivating.probably aimed towards teen readers but here i am 10 years later looking for it.you will get lost in this book and if youre not careful you may even feel the scottish wind breeze by you late at night.a true gem.
2,Shockingly Ordinary,"Another majorly overhyped La Mer product. I bought this and used the entire bottle up, and never noticed any results whatsoever. It is just an ok moisturizer, but certainly not remotely worth the price."
1,Didn't work,"The movie may be great, but my DVD player (which is a new SONY) couldn't read the disc. Haven't had this problem with any other DVD I purchased on amazon. I had to return."
2,DOES NOT PLAY IN OUR DVD PLAYERS,"I HAVE TRIED PLAYING THIS DVD IN FOUR DIFFERENT PLAYERS. I DIDN'T NOTICE IF IT IS A DIFFERENT FORMAT. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT, THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED , I NOW HAVE 3 DVD'S I CANNOT USE."
1,Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year,We can't watch the video because it came from the United Kingdom and it requires a typed in code in order to view. What do we do? There is no information on the invoice. Thank you.
1,does not play in the USA!!!,was unable to watch this in our dvd player and the computer it was not compatible with our stuff in the USA. would have been nice to know this before buying opening and then discovering it....
4,A camcorder easy enough for Grandma,"Very good camcorder for those looking for less buttons, easy to use and great results. The LCD screen is great for recording yourself and with others, knowing you got the shot you wanted and those tri-pod shots to difficult looking through a view finder. A movement activation option for those who what to see what goes on while their away is rather cool. It works so well in low level light, we haven't used the built-in light source yet. A camcorder you don't have to carry a manual around and with the quality of those you do."
2,Save yourself the Trouble and Time,"Save yourself the Trouble and Time of watching this highlights clip show and get the real Lone Wolf and Cub series it's based on. Same Scenes, better story.The first three anyway."
4,Teachers pay attention,I found this very useful in my classroom. I was even able to modify this for my lower level students. It is a great guide.
1,watch out,"i didn't know about the serious bible stuff until it was too late. i had handed it out. also, the pages do not match the scribner's edition. (e.g. second day assigned to page 86, then questions on description of fish goes into page 90). always a big problem. do not use this study guide. you will have lots of problems."
3,Early Fante,"This collection of Fante's short stories is worth having, but shop around for a copy under $35. There are some really great stories here, but don't go through this book all at once, as you'll probably become bored hearing about being an alter boy story after story.Most of the writing here is early Fante stuff. Its great to see where Fante came from. Some of his later shorts are at the end, which is cool becasue you can see his progression.While worth having, this book is not, what I'd call, essential."
3,Some decent short stories,There are some decent stories here. Almost all of them end abruptly. John writes of the joy and tragedy of life. His bandini series of novels are better. This book is more of an appetizer.
4,Turn this into a Region Free Player,"OK, first the bad. When upconverting to 1080i, the screen is much darker than it should be. 720p looks good but sometimes during a movie, a horizontal fuzzy line appears. It's noticable but not a movie ruining experience. I think it's caused by the video upconverting chip but I haven't played with 480p to be sure. I'm using DVI connected to my 32"" widescreen LCD TV.The jewel of this player lies in the capability to play any region DVD. You'll have to Google for how to do it but I'll give you a hint: You need an Aiwa stereo remote or something that can be programmed to do as such. You can also make it HDCP free using a different method but I haven't played with that at all."
2,Good for awhile only,"Samsung- good out of the box for about a year or so. I bought this new for $180 when released. Lasted about 2 years. The SW got corrupted somehow. No ""restart"" or ""reboot"" to bring about like you have for a CMOS on a motherboard of a computer or for that matter many electronic devices these days. Supported many formats out of box as advertised even home-grown DVDs, but the reliability isn't there. My really old Sony DVD still lives beyond this one. For this unit think 1 to 2 years life. If you want more life, look elsewhere."
1,Don't waste you money on this....,"Mine stopped working in 3 days.... don't waste your money on this. The seller, Samsungmall, and Samsung customer service is fairly unresponsive. Get something more reliable. DO NOT GET THE REFURBISHED UNITS as they have been poorly fixed."
2,not recommended,I could not see any difference between my Panasonic progressive scan and this one. In fact picture quality is worse in 850 and it broke down after 32 days. Do not buy HD-850 series it seems it has lot of issue.
1,Only works in HDMI,"Bought a refurbised unit. HDMI output great; component output miserable: all pink and grainy. Returned it for a replacement and the same problem with the replacement.I reserve the single HDMI input on my TV for the cable box, so need to use the component output for the DVD.Careful, or you may have the same problem."
3,Very odd...,"Besides my preference for slower tempi in general, this recording just strikes me as missing the point. Playing a composer like Shostakovich slightly slower is great to add weight to the music, but this recording seems to ooze too much in the fast movements, and it's a tad too dead to do the oozing that is necessary for the slow parts.All in all, playing was pretty good, but I think this interpretation is pretty bizarre. Check it out from a library or something before you buy this one. Make sure you really like it. I'm not at all sure what to make of it yet."
3,Sweet sunshing,"These wallables are adorable. The adhesive didn't last for very long, but no big deal, I just hung them on the wall with tacks. My son loves touching them and admiring them over his changing station. My only complaint is that I have to push really hard to get the music to activate."
4,good phone but sprint has major overbilling problems,"The Phone is great, Sprint service is another issue. I, along with most people i know have had problems where sprint over bills them. Sprint really doesn't seem to care that they have a cronic overbilling problem. If u call and complain (after about 10-20 minutes on the phone with a rep) they do fix it, but u will have to watch your bill like a hawk and call monthly to get it adjusted. They really need to work on their customer service. They dont really seem to care about GOOD customer service."
2,Great phone but poor service,"The phone itself is a 5-star. The user interface is easy to use. The screen is bright. Battery prolongs several days on one charge. It receives better signal.The customer service is pretty bad, though. In fact, my wife is talking to their customer service when I write this review and it's been 2.5 hours on the phone and 1.5 hours in the SprintPCS store, let alone the time to get to the store. It was the technical support department that shed light on the issue which was customer service department's responsibility. Probably you want to call technical support department instead of customer service department when you have issues.Overall, a great phone with poor customer service."
1,poor voice quality,"I have own the Sanyo cellphone for a month now, and it has been a horrible month for me to use this cellphone. Voice transmitted is distorted and therefore whenever somebody calls me, I have to put the cellphone very close to my ear, listen to the mumbling voice and make a guess on each word, and it hurts my ear after I make a five minutes short conversation. I have adjusted the receiver level to the highest level, but it does not help.I will not buy a Sanyo cellphone anymore and I will try to sell this cellphone as soon as possible."
2,Phone and Service are bad,"ok, i bought this phone in may and i already hate it. The reception is good but thats about it. The menus on this phone are very confusing and it only comes with one wallpaper:flowers. Now i am a boy and i dont want flowers on my phone.I dont like how it is so hard to open either, and its really ugly. The Keys are poorly backlit and pre-loaeded ringtones sound like they were made for old people. And the music ringtones sound awful and they are distorted. I am going with t-mobile and thier motorola v300 as soon as i get my money back for this peice."
1,I HATE THIS PHONE!,"I HATE THIS PHONE! I had this phone for two days then i got rid of it and i got the Samsung VGA1000. this phone just plan old sucks. the cameras pictures dont look good at all, the back ground on the main screen wouldnt change, infact the phone is just ugly to. I'l say it again I HATE THIS PHONE! it doesnt even deserve one star!"
2,Don't buy this phone.,"I'm surprised how many other reviewers liked this phone. I can't imagine that they've actually used it much. This phone suffers from poor usability all over: It's a little too slick to hold, it's hard to open with one hand, it's hard to hear unless you hold it just the right way to your ear, the reception is awful (this is compared to a cheaper phone at the same place and time on the same Sprint network), the menuing system is clunky, and it uses it's sloooowww web interface to compose email (including SMS texting... it takes 10 to 20 seconds just to get into the message editor).This is just one of those products that you know the makers don't actually use themselves. It would take a lot of convincing to get me to try another Sanyo product after this experience. I may just go back to Nokia."
4,Sanyo SCP-8100 - A Pleasant Surprise,"Being the type who said he would never have a cellular phone, my wife and I went ahead and took the plunge about a year ago and bought matching 8100s--and let me say we're now the converted. This picture phone has paid for itself in so many different ways, including, but not limited to; international calling plan (SPRINT PCS) which has great quality of reception, been used in several emergency situations, the camera-function has allowed us to send fun and important photos back and forth. The only complaint we have is that the battery tends to die quickly with a lot of use - and it does not give much warning before just shutting down."
1,Worst Customer Service Ever!,"The phone may have been good, I would have found out if Sprint ever activated my service. After more than five weeks of waiting for them to transfer my cell phone number from another carrier and literally spending hours on the phone (mostly on hold) with them I gave up and cancelled. I routinely spent over an hour on hold to speak to a customer service agent, who could never actually resolve anything, although some did share that it is common with them to take more than 30 days to transfer phone numbers. I had heard Sprint had poor customer service, and now wish I had taken it seriously."
2,"good, inexpensive phone.","i got this phone when it first came out; and at the time this was the lowest priced flip camera phone. i love the feel, and how easy it is to use. besides the fact that sprint's service is getting worse by the day, the only problems i am having with the phone is it gets hot when i'm on it for more than fifteen minutes, the battery life is a little below average, and it tends to shut off and turn back on by itself when i'm in the middle of using my vision service. the phone is decent, but i am pretty ticked about sprint service."
1,Broken hinge,"Purchased two of these in Jan 2004. One, with very little use has one broken hinge and the other is going. The other one is just a matter of time. Must now return to Sprint store to see if they will replace it. I have seen two other reviews on this phone on c-net with the same problem. (besides the post here)"
1,Faulty hinge,"After purchasing this phone with extended warrenty from Radio Shack and owning it for less than 9 months, the hinge on the antena side broke. When it was sent in to be fixed UNDER WARRENTY I received a call back stating that the part was NOT covered and that even though the phone showed no signs of abuse that it was my fault that the hinge broke. It looks to be a factory defect on that side after speaking with the Sprint store in town, however it has not been recalled... I would NOT recommend getting this phone unless you can afford to be with out a phone for 2 weeks while the company gives a poor reason as to why they can't repair it under warrenty. For the company to repair the phone it will cost $76.00. I am in the process of reading back through the warrenty and sales slip. Ultimately, I will be shopping for a different phone in the near future."
2,Everybody sounds like a tin can,"This phone has nice features but I've never liked it. Everything is great except actually talking on the phone. I've always had trouble hearing people and their voices are often rattly, if that's a word. Also the small size makes it difficult to dial."
1,Poor quality !!,"I have had the Sanyo 8100 phone from Sprint for about 14 months. After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part. I have not dropped the phone or done anything else to warrant all the damage. The hinge to flip open the phone has completely broken -first just one side broke and pretty soon the entire thing broke. Then just yesterday the display completely stopped working as well. According to Sprint, I am not eligible for a new phone for another 3-4 months so now I am going to be forced to spend about $200 just to get a new phone that will probably just break after a year. I'm completely dissatisfied. This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made."
3,Decent phone,"On a whole, this is a good cell phone. I've had this phone since 8/2003 and haven't had too many problems. The camera is a nice toy, but the resolution is bad - the novelty of having a camera phone has worn off a long time ago for me. Reception and call clarity are for the most part good. The phone is a bit bulky - can't really put it in your jeans' pockets or in a small clutch/purse. I usually don't have problems with calls until last night when my calls kept getting dropped - even though I had 4-5 signal bars. According to Sprint, it might because they're doing software updates. If this continues, I'm just changing carriers because my contract just ended about 3 days ago and they won't entice me into staying by giving me more minutes for the same price."
1,Not secure,"If you are looking for a secure mail box and not just a ""locking"" mailbox avoid these guys.(...). The opening at the top is so large anyone can reach down in and grab anything the wish. I'll be creating my own soultion to make it work but....The customer servers was of the mind that locking does not mean secure. I'll say. No help what so ever. Avoid these people."
2,Leaky mailboxes leave you with wet mail,"Our Condo Association has 36 of these on external walls, and we have had no end of headaches as a result of neighbors with wet mail. Unless these are sheltered in some way from the elements -- inside a foyer, covered somehow -- a good rainstorm will blow water in through the front-facing slot where it will collect and soak your mail. A bad design choice for inclement regions."
1,A whole lot of very little,"The stories chosen for this book are average at best. The new stories do nothing to grab the imagination and the stories from established authors just give the feeling of being chosen more for their obscurity (cheap royalties?) than the quality of the stories. The whole thing just seems to have a feel of ""let's get as many words into a book as cheaply as possible"".If you're looking for something to while away the time, you've come to the right place. If you're looking for a collection of stories that either defines the genre or challenges the imagination, you'll want to look somewhere else."
3,for electric warrior freaks only,"Basically it's good, fresh material from solo marc on his acoustic with plenty of improvisation and new takes on tunes. i think the album is more on the haunting, lonely side rather than the typical thumping, rocking side. but if you're looking for exceptional quality and a rockin' good time, look elsewhere."
1,Boring and Tiresome,"This is not a good read. It is poorly written, incoherent, and even with all the murders and black magic, the author still manages to make the medieval era of European history come across as acute boredom. Maybe with some major editing the writing could be improved, but the plot just does not succeed."
1,HVAC Plans,"I was thoroughly disappointed by the book. Admittedly, I may have misunderstood what the intention (or intended market) was for the book.If you are looking to be able to read, and create blueprints for an HVAC application - that can then be read by an HVAC professional, and a bid on the project performed - don't buy this book.The book is a basic look at drafting (very basic - for example whole chapters dealing with things like scales and how to measure angles). There is no useful info that would allow one to either make use of or create new plans for a particular application."
4,Worth watching,This action drama was well acted and has a good story line. We enjoyed Sleeper Cell very much.
5,Sleeper Cell Season One,"This is a refreshing series regarding terrorism as we are witnessing it in today's world. The producers were not afraid to address the threat of the Radical Islamic Factions that are among us and their willingness to die for their cause to destroy America. It is more realistic than ""24"" in-that there are no on-going conspiracies and paranoia among those within the FBI Unit that controls the undercover agent. The realism also hits home with the moral dilemmas the undercover agent is faced with to stay alive."
4,Strong performances from Michael Ealy and Oded Fehr,"This show could have been a lot worse. Melissa Sagemiller looks amazing with dark hair and freckles. I'm not sure how I feel about this series but I did watch the entire season and have just finished the second season where the strongest hit was in the last five minutes of the first episode of the second season; maybe that means that this series is compelling. If you don't agree with how news is represented from the perspective of law enforcement and the terrorists, then you should still watch it to know about those perspectives. The espousing may be tedious but it is never repetitive without a point being made.Michael Ealy would make a dependable leading man for a superhero franchise. I can see him as Batman Beyond more than Green Lantern."
4,Good acting. Good story.,"I would call this ""24 meets Alias"". It's a very well produced show, a bit raw at times, but I would recommend. Good acting, refreshing cast, some good dialogues."
5,Great series,This series is proof that Showtime is outclassing HBO in the mini-series. The last episode was intense. Really curious to see how they write the second season.
4,Love the show,"Great drama that shows what I would think are the difficulties of an undercover operation in the FBI and also the inner conflict that the agent has within himself as a practicing Muslim. This is a good story that is well told and well acted. I like the way the story tells about the fear, the doubts, and the fundamental principles that the lead character has. As with many things in life there is not a straight line to follow or a clear difference of black and white, there is grey and sometimes a lot more grey than we want to deal with and that is what makes this story interesting."
5,You will enjoy this show if you like Homeland,"If you like shows such as Homeland, you'll enjoy this show. I have seen the second season, but will be starting that soon."
4,Entertainment and just that,"The series gave me something to do and I looked forward to the next installment..so it is good entertainment by my definition. Other reviewers on this site are focused on the lack of ""realism"" embodied in the show. So what? Why would anyone watching a bubble gum machine (TV) be seeking realism. Go outside, read the paper (well that may be a stretch), look around and you will find realism. Heck, I know Batman doesn't exist nor do the Klingons really pose a threat, but they are entertaining. Its worth a watch if you like suspense.Bottomline, you want some enterainment then watch the series. You want realism, watch life."
2,This is F-ed UP!,"The show was ok until they show a scene where they used five dogs to test their bioweapon. That, drew the line for me. I won't watch it anymore. I am sure it happens in the world but I like to focus on saving dogs and not the ugliest of men, I don't give a rats A-hole what religion you are. Men have used their religion to do cruel things because they are sure of the ""reward"" they will get in the afterlife. Well, I hope the ""afterlife"" is a huge surprise for them. A dark and brutal surprise for the pain and suffering these extremists impose on men and animals. I hope hell isn't just ""hell"" but several levels of hell of torture for these SOBs."
1,if reality is your oxygen...you'll suffocate watching this,"it's not just that reality has got to take a back seat to action, but it's been bound and gagged and left bleeding in the trunk. and then the producers have the gall to crow over their educational product. i got suckered into buying this by good reviews in the new york times and the new yorker- obviously they have one standard for films and another for tv shows. if you want real terrorists, read the transcript in the october 2006 issue of harpers magazine- the supposed terrorists in this dvd collection are straight from ""the apprentice""."
4,Poor transfer of excellent clips,"Like several other documentaries this one resorts to adding filler in the form of War Department films showing briefings prior to missions. While this is generally ok, this approach misses the point -- namely, showing gun footage. Scenes that were used are often excellent, but the quality of transfer appears to be poor. Obviously, such films would have severe lighting problems. What it looks like to me is a poor quality system was used for the transfer process. On the other hand, some of the music in the background was very good. There were many other film sources (e.g., Russian) that could have been added to make this an excellent film for those that are interested in aviation history. Too bad none of these were used."
3,Great films but poor presentation,"The films are great as they are documentation from real life.However, the producers fail to attach the film with any kindof useful data: when, who, where? In most cases you can't tellwho is who. Is the shooter allied/axis and who is the victim.If the producers had attached the date as text in films Iwould have enjoyed them much more. Some films are from Europeand others from Pacific. I did not find any shot from EasternFront. Surely there has been films taken? Besides that the films are unique and they are must for every air combat enthusiast."
4,Good Value,My wife purchased ACQUA DI GIO Giorgio Armani after shave in a store. I've gotten good comments from other people about it. I wanted to try the Balm. I got it at a good price on Amazon.
3,cologne for Ed,"actually returned this product as I mis-read the description, thought it was cologne, turned out to be shave lotion. I will return to Amazon again for future purchases"
4,Coffee to go,I enjoyed this bookInspirational and has some great advise for all those would entrepreneurs out there. If you are thinking of opening your own coffee shop or start up business then you might just enjoy this book too.Worth a read
2,"Heavy-handed and dead, but Americans dont seem to mind","Why is that American choralphiles and most choral singers seem to go along whole-heartedly with the heavy-hand of these bohemoth old-school conductors? Page, Shaw, Hillis, Flummerfelt - it's all over done and lacks spark (well, that which doesnt come from sheer volume and thickness).If you want to hear Poulenc sung with style and life - then listen to Harry Christophers and The Sixteen.I have been a professional singer, both from the inside and outside of choirs, large and small, for the last 15 years. I have sung with 90% of the professional choirs in America and a handful of European conductors and their choirs. As an American, it's hard to explain to my American colleagues why I prefer to work in the UK and Europe, but if I want to actually enjoy the experience, I never work here in the states.Leave Shaw to the big, robust choral rep (his Rachmaninoff/Vespers is great), but PLEASE - if the music has any life or light... steer clear!"
4,Mood Music,"NIce recording. 5 stars for the recording, performance and interpretation. 3.5/4 stars for the music itself which is a bit cloying, precious, and at times even banal. One would prefer a heavier hand (Verdi) or a lighter hand (Messiaen) or absolute genius (Mozart/Brahms). Do not get me wrong. This lite style, as with anything by John Taverner or the Faure Requiem, is still very pleasing, perfectly fine ambient ""mood"" music."
5,Beautiful balance and blend,"My initial response is simply, ""Ooooo....Ahhhhh..."" The Festival Singers' voices are perfectly balanced and well blended and therefore effectively communicate the sacred reverence of Poulenc's writing while emphasizing the beautiful harmonies of his music. I think the echo of the church is just enough to help the listener feel he/she is present, but not so much as to muddle the music. It's actually very accurate for a European cathedral choral sound. As a choir singer, I have a special appreciation for their attention to detail and perfectly tuned chords making very challenging 20th century music sound deceptively simple without sacrificing any of the emotional attributes of the pieces."
4,Impressive Gift,"I bought this for my brother for Christmas to adorn his new desk. He was thrilled when he saw it. It high a very high quality look and feel. Very heavy and substantial. The wood and gold is beautiful. However, I don't know how it's working since he took it home with him to Florida."
1,empty,she bendy - but empty vessel - a daoist form - but she not practicedaoist principles in her life - all about her ego
4,good cooler,this cooler kept our water cool longer than i had thought it would.the spout worked great.. and the best thing of all it did not leak like lots of other things i hvae purchased in the past for camping. And we can use it at parties at home too.
5,Sports Jug,This jug is very sturdy and will come in handy for future family & friends events. I will no longer have to call around to McDonald's asking if they have one available. It will also save the cost on beverages that we offer to our guests. I am so happy with this purchase!
2,Only One Old Heckle and Jeckle,I bought this looking for Heckle and Jeckle cartoons and there's only one of them on the entire 4-DVD set. The King Midas and Rapunzel clay-mations on the first DVD are great. I remember them from grade school and haven't seen them since then.
2,Disapointed,"I was excited when I first made the purchase, but was disapointed with the quality. It looked like it was videotaped from a TV screen instead of being a reproduction converted to a disc."
3,A matter of content,"There is nothing wrong with this fine recording of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra led by Jesus Lopez-Cobos. They play wonderfully. The music in general is well known and easily identified but I find it a bit boring. Especially the Carmen Suite. The L'arlesienne Suite No. 1 is more interesting and the minuetto is down right beautiful. Symphony No. 1 is expressive and has moments of engaging expression.For me, it's a matter of content.Although not my favorite composer, I find Lopez-Cobos to always find ways to bring the orchestra to an embracing warm glow. If you love Bizet, this is a very fine disc."
1,Nothing here for beginners. Total ripoff.,"I bought two books on accordion published by Mel Bay. This one came last and I thought that being that the other one was good, this would be nearly as good or better. This 32 page book has one half page of instruction. It is not for the beginner. It shows you where to put your hand for the base buttons. That is all. Then it goes into about 30 pages of sheet music. It is assumed I guess that you know all about music because this doesn't even tell you what a quarter note is or what the base and treble symbols are. A lot better book is Accordion Method by Frank Zucco. At least that book has pictures and tells you a little about music. Oh one more thing about the Easyist Accordion book. That half page of instruction has two spelling or grammer errors in it that I found. Must be nobody bothered to read that half page. Mr. Griffin if you are reading this, intument is spelled instrument. Ric."
2,not a teach-yourself-accordian book,"though the sheet music in this book is good for practicing, there wasn't enough introductory information for those of us who are picking up an accordian for the 1st time in our lives. For example, I could have used more information on proper positioning of my hands, phrasing, posture, and fingering. I also wouldn't mind some historical/background information on the accordian.And for those of us who are learning accordian as a 2nd (or 3rd)instrument, all the music-reading information is obviously too basic for us."
5,Heart Touching Fiction based on true stories,"I was deeply touched by this story of Poland and an American who became a part of the tapestry of the events while Poland was struggling to find true freedom. It is a story of faith in action during tragic hardships.Out of the Red Shadow (Hidden Harvest, Book 3)"
3,"Good for transition, but not for learning","In many ways this is a good book. I just don't feel that it's a good ""learning"" book.For a person wanting to learn Excel 2007, this book's biggest flaw is the lack of hands-on exercises.It does include some step-by-step examples, but they assume that the data already exists. This would have been okay had a CD been included, or the files were available on the Que site, but neither seemed to be the case. Therefore, I didn't find them terribly useful.I would recommend that new Excel 2007 users look elsewhere. However, those making the transition from Excel 2003 might find this a fairly decent text.No half stars so I'm stuck at 3 instead of 3 1/2..."
2,Look Elsewhere for Better Quality,"I purchased this book as a reference for a class that I am teaching. So far I've only read about 10 chapters of material, but have found at least 50 errors. These range from small, such as spelling, to large, aggravating issues such as referring to the wrong figures or charts. I have actually stopped reading the book and have purchased another from a different company and author. My suggestion would be to look at other books and purchase one of those. There are at least three other books on the market that do a better job than this one."
4,good for child or pet loss,This book was a gift. It was given to me because my son passed away from a terminal genetic muscle defect 11 days after he was born.The pictures are gorgeous!! I give the pictures 5 stars.The story is cute and simple. I would recommend this book to be read to children who are dealing with the loss of a pet or the loss of a friend/sibling. It is also a charming book for an adult who has also suffered a loss.
4,fun addition to the game,"these blanks are not only fun, they are really great quality. my cards look great and i can't wait til they turn up in the game!"
5,Romantic Bruckner?,"Romantic? Not quite. Pastoral would be a more apt title. This symphony is full of hunting horn themes. The motives are organic and pure but never too lusty. In fact, the structure might even remind you of the dark tone poem ""Le Chasseur Maudit"" by Franck. The third movement, ""Sehr schnell"" works up a good lather and the finale tops it off perfectly with Bruckner's signature monolithic brass. The strings and brass interact beautifully together unlike some Bruckner where they compete for territory. Telarc captures the Cincinnati Symphony with clear, well-balanced dynamics. A wonderful glimpse of the sunnier side of Bruckner."
5,BRINGS THE HOUSE DOWN,"Because there are 6 different singers at first ""Kid Ramos"" sounded like a blues compilation. But after a second listen you appreciate the west coast dream team with the likes of Willie Chambers,Lynwood Slim and others. This is my favorite ""Kid"" cd because it has him playing superbly on a variety of blues guitar styles including slow stuff like ""Helsinki Laundromat Blues"" with James Harman on vocals and uptempo instrumental songs like ""Bandstand Boogie"". Thanks Kid Ramos for showing the world we have great blues, here on the left coast."
4,Great Modern Blues Disc,"Wonderful release from an under appreciated California guitar player. Kid Ramos is an excellent blues artist and plays here with a variety of tones and set ups. Ramos is backed by some of the best musicians in modern blues today including: James Harman, Richard Innes, Kim Wilson, Lynwood Slim, Rob Rio, and others. The music is straight ahead Chicago style blues. It is a great listen from beginning to end."
3,Very helpful photos - missing symbol descriptions,"I liked the fact that most of the plants in this book are shown FULL GROWN with full color photographs. Photographs of full grown plants and groups of full grown plants are very, very helpful when planning a garden or landscape. I also appreciated that each plant description indicated if the plant would need to be staked for support.Don't buy this book without the dust jacket! The meaning for the symbols at the top of each plant description are not in the book. They are only on the dust jacket! Also, the directory pages were color coded but I couldn't find a key to determine what the color coding meant. I had to guess."
4,"Evocative, minimalist poetry","This is a dual language book - Spanish and English - occasionally both in the same text. The form of the poetry is short line, free form e.g. from ""Natural Criminal"" ""I am/ a nomad/ in a country/ of settlers"" or in Spanish ""soy/ un nomada/ en un pais/ de sedentarios"". Ordinarily, this form would become tiring when reading poem after poem with little variation in structure. However, Alarcon varies content and uses the form to set ""gems"" of images.While I would not expect to see these poems anthologized three centuries from now, they are immediate and evocative - well worth your time reading."
5,The Best,My dog destroyed the regular sized one in a week. The souper chocolate bone has lasted at least a month now. I can only find it online but it's definitely worth it. The chocolate is his favorite.
4,Great book - jam packed with good stuff!,"I ordered this book a while back, and we're still reading it. Extreme Space is not a book you can read through once and not expect to pick it up again... great for referencing when you encounter new and old situations alike. Several times, Ms. Mallory addressed issues that I'd never seen addressed before, but had been searching for information on for a long time, such as Primal Space and latent behaviors.This is definitely a book I'm pleased to have found. I've recommended it to several friends. The only thing I didn't like about it, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that at times it's not edited for mistakes as well as I would have liked (but I only noticed it because I notice things like that.)"
1,Unreadable,"This book is nearly unreadable rambling of random emotions and opinions, leading nowhere. Worse, the author's has the EXTREMELY ANNOYING habit of capitalizing words for emphasis. The overall effect is kind of new-agey: lots of words, but no information. The typesetting is poor and the editing nonexistent. Save your money and buy the New Topping Book, or Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns, or S&M 101."
1,Need Earplugs!!,"This Keyboard was a big disappointment with its tympanum breaking sound quality, its non intuitive controls and flimsy quality. The sounds are too blaring and the volume control is almost non existent. Within a few weeks of getting this some of the keys fell off.At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. This is a sorry apology for a keyboard. This keyboard has joined the pile of other toys that dont see the light of day after the first week of euphoria. If you want your kids to develop a musical ear then stay away from this keyboard!!!- Urmila Sreedharan"
2,Dont Waste Your Money,This is the worst toy I have ever bought. I bought this for my 5 yr old to get her interested in playing a instrusment. first of all it only has two volumes loud and louder. The keyboard plays only one sound KEYBOARD!! no piano no flute just KEYBOARD. It has no good rhythms and the play back songs are awful. This was a waste of my money and I'm taking it back TODAY
1,Horrible!,"I bought this for my son's birthday last night since he is interested in music. As I was wrapping it, I noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position. I took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place, wondering how many times I was going to have to do this. I decided to test it once I fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys (you can even see through them). The dollar store has better toys than this. The sound is horrible and uncontrollable. The controls are worthless. I'm returning it today, and good riddance."
2,Too electronic,"I was asking for a keyboard to learn to play piano and make music. This keyboard doesn't sound like any instrument, just electronics. It's too loud, the volume adjusts but not much. The microphone is fun but doesn't attach anywhere so just drags behind. Overall good toy but bad sound."
1,Wouldn't work!!,"From day one, we could not get it to work! We will have to take it back and definitely buy a different brand!"
1,Makes me want to vomit and [...] my pants,"This has to be the worst piece of crap that I've ever heard. The keyboard notes sound like a dying duck or something of that nature. It sounds awful, but the batteries are good. If you need to get 6 AA batteries buy this keyboard. I think the batteries are worth more than this thing. Luckily I got this for free with my order so it isn't all a loss. I needed batteries."
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE,"It is actually hard to believe what a piece of garbage this is. The sound that comes out of it is actually offensive. I rated this as 1 star, but it should really be ZERO, but that option was not available. This was free with my order, but is really just a waste of space."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY....,"BOUGHT THIS IN CLEARANCE AT TOYS R US, IT SOUNDS LIKE JUNK AND POORLY MADE. I PLAN TO RETURN THE 2 BOUGHT FOR MY TWINS. I WAS FORCED TO PUT ONE STAR BUT WOULD HAVE ALSO LEFT ZERO IF I COULD. SPEND A LITTLE MORE, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. THIS WOULD BE BEST LEFT AT THE CURB, THAN TAKING UP ROOM IN MY GIRLS BEDROOMS....SAD, SAD, SAD... I HATE RETRUNING THINGS, IT IS A WASTE OF MY TIME."
5,It's just a classic,"Even if you don't like all the tracks, you have to understand that this is a 'blueprint' of dance music. Plain and simple, this is A CLASSIC. I'm surprised of all the lack of knowledge from all these so called 'fans' on here. This was their start kids. They were doing this while you were lost watching MTV and jumping music scenes trying to find your real self. lol..... just sayin ;)"
5,Great seller!,Great seller! The item was shipped very quickly and it arrived prior to the estimate that I was given! I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
1,not what you thought,"If you have recently started listining to sasha or digweed this is not at all what you are going to hear. This mix is very old and very cheesy, lots of irratating vocals, wack beats and so on.I love Sasha he is my favorite D.J./producer but this old stuff sucks, dont hate on me for telling the truth, anything he and digweed have done for global underground is 100 percent better, try Sasha Ibiza or digweed hong kong, both are great."
1,Disappointing,"For those who enjoyed Communicate, which I is one my favourite electronic CDs, this one is going to disappoint (and at more than $50, it's an expensive mistake). I'm sick of mix CDs such as this one being such a let down. You would think on 3 CDs there would be more than just a few decent songs. Save your money."
1,Sounds Kinda' Not Good,"Yeah, it's in a pretty package and the inside is set up pretty cool but...the content is lame! I am very disappointed. I have been a huge fan of Sasha and Digweed for over a decade and this is the worst I've ever heard from them...it's something you'd hear playing in a bad techno bar. I wish that I could return it, perhaps I'll use the cover for a collage or something and the c.d.'s as coasters."
2,Not the greatest,"1. This was not the first DJ mix CD to be released commercialy.2. The mixing isn't exactly the best out there, not even 20 tracks per CD.3. There are better CD's out there, you only know this one because Sasha & Digweed were the ones who became the most famous and hence the most accessible.2 stars for the decent tunes."
1,brittle plastic junk,I bought one. It came yesterday. While removing the end caps of the battery compartments to load batteries for the first time two of the locking tabs broke off. The plastic is horribly brittle. I wasn't forcing anything just - crack and two tabs fell off. I am sending it back and shopping a different brand. This was junk.
2,Can't raise a candle to a LED. Unsatisfactory,This headlamp is not bright enough to use for biking. It broke during my first use.
5,Troybilt Pro-Line FRT,"I received the tiller in timely fashion, assembled it easily and was amazed when the Honda engine fired on the first pull. When the transmission is disengaged it is easy to roll back and forth to the garden.I had previously had my new garden plot broken up, but a few passes back and forth had it looking like a powder puff...smooth, no clods, and really ready for planting.All in all, I am pleased with my choice of tiller, even though it was a bit more expensive than some others I could have bought."
3,"Runs fine, leaks transmission oil","Tiller assembly was easy, Honda engine started first pull. Had to adjust belt tightener items on both belts to prevent squealing and to keep reverse belt from coming off idler. The major issue is that the transmission leaks like a sieve out the front shaft seal. Not sure the factory even installed the seal. Will take it to an authorized shop to repair this under warranty later in the gardening season. I suspected something like this as the transmission was very low on oil at delivery. Probably leaked out during storage and shipment. Not counting this seal, the tiller is exactly as I expected."
4,Fixed lamp,"This item was needed to repair a lamp I didn't want to get rid of, especially because it is a beautiful matching pair."
2,"Should have been titled ""Leslie Rule's Encounters w/Ghosts""","If you want to know about the hauntings in Leslie Rule's life, buy this book! For not wanting to write about herself, Leslie sure seems to enjoy writing about herself.I was sucked in by the photograph on the cover of the book. Leslie Rule DOES know how to take a photo (the spookiest thing about this book are some of the photographs). But, they certainly don't merit the price of the book. Leave this one behind, kind reader."
1,ugh,"I have no idea how this book was published. There are so many obvious grammatical errors that should have been caught. I guess the book is so dull that an editor couldn't be bothered to actually read it. Even if the grammatical mistakes weren't there it would still be horribly written. Like some of the other reviewers have stated, this book is all over the place. Each story is very short, uninteresting, and biased. Good thing this was a gift, I would be really upset if I had paid for it."
3,Sketchy - not as thorough as I would have liked.,It was an okay book but seemed sketchy in ways.The book seemed to be just anecdotes and it was insubstantial.
2,Could be better,"I've read many of ghost books and I must say this one isn't the best. The book is vague...It seems as though having the content fit a specific page range or word limit was more important than the actual stories themselves. I found myself asking for better examples or more elaboration on the parts that seemed promising. It's as if it's enough to make you curious but not curious enough to really give the book a second thought. The book could really be better, have more ""meat"" in each of the stories instead of just a broad generalization that is an urban legend. Any how, if you really want to get chills or read a better written stories about abondaned and curious places that you'd swear are haunted.[...]"
5,superb storytelling style,"""Coast to Coast Ghosts"" will draw you in immediately with Leslie Rule's easy, conversational style and with the dramatic pictures she took at various haunted sites all over the US. If you take the attitude, ""There ain't no such thing as a ghost"", Rule's book may make you re-examine your thinking. Remember that a corollary of Einstein's breakthrough relativity theory is that time and space are not linear; instead they are relative to each other, and linked in ways that are yet beyond our understanding.Both fun and fascinating, this book is a marvelous addition to the literature of the paranomal in America. Skeptics will be intrigued, and believers will be delighted. Highly recommended!"
5,A Must Read For Ghost Story Lovers,"This is one of the best books I've read about true ghost stories. The writer reaches right in and grabs your attention...making you feel like your right there, experiencing these events right along with the helpless victims sharing their lives with these spirits. Included with the ghostly tales are a listing of haunted colleges and information to ""signs that a place is haunted"". It was wonderful to read that this writer was not just writing about other peoples experiences, but she includes several of her own personal experiences with ghosts...making me realize that she just didn't interview and write, she was sympathetic to something she understood to be true, something she has personally experienced. I would highly recommend this book to all that are crazy about reading true ghost stories. Fantastic writer! Hope to see more books from Leslie Rule in the future on this subject!!"
5,Ghosts,I am almost done reading this book it is very interesting with helpful places to check out if you are a ghost buster yourself.
2,Zzzzz,"Our book club tries to read something like this around Halloween every year. I was disappointed in this book. It's not that it was really bad, it was just a far cry from being really good. But, I kind of go for stories and characters and entertainment. Nothing like that here. Just a compilation of occurrences and events across the country that may or may not involve ghosts. Some were almost interesting. Did you know there are places where the lights come on and go off all by themselves? Did you know that there are places where the door was certainly closed at night, and then in the morning....yup....door opened....no kidding. Not for me."
2,Good reading for teens....,"....but not for the adult level reader. I bought this book based on some good reviews...i was disappointed. The material is not that compelling and was written at a level intended for a juvenile audience. Also,it was very poorly edited. Unless you are looking for good supernatural oriented material for your kids, passs on this one. There are much better choices out there."
4,Great read,"The reader easily slips into each recounting of visitors from the other side. Ghostly apparitions and tricks. Actual accounts from hotels, a bit consice. If you like short stories go ahead."
1,"Why this video, when better and cheaper are available?","I am a childbirth teacher who owns several circumcision videos, all of them better than The Circumcision Video... Parents who want more information about circumcision do not want to be patronized. No medical organization in the world promotes routine infant circumcision. All organizations call for mandatory anesthesia, so this video's downplaying of the pain involved is especially galling.Whole areas of discussion are missing. It is impossible to make this decision unless you know the purpose and function of the foreskin. Common misperceptions about circumcision need to be addressed, too. The simplicity and ease of genital care, and the fact that most of the world does not circumcise are essential facts.Circumcision? Intact Facts is a far better circumcision video. This 18 minute video is designed for childbirth classes. The surgery and the pain aren't sugar-coated. Parents are given the facts they need to make an informed choice..."
2,Poor example,"This video is a poor example of what a circumcision looks like. This one has been edited and has soft music. It's obviously a piece made to be pro-circumcision. If you are trying to make that decision, don't take this as an unbiased example."
1,behind the times,"This is a good video if you want to see how the procedure is/was rationalized. Sorry to say, it isn't a fair portrayal of the procedure and seems to have been made specifically by the makers of these surgical devices to convince people they aren't really as evil as they seem to some. Um, very misleading. A more accurate and in-depth video is ""Whose Body/Whose Rights?"", a PBS documentary. If you want a real examination of circumcision, that is the video to think about."
5,Helen Corbitt's Cookbook,I received this in 1978 as a newlywed from my aunt. I have used it for the last 22 years and have had great success with most of the recipes. Some are a bit dated but most stand the test of time. My daughter is getting married and I am purchasing one for her.
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED,ITEM WAS NEVR RECEIVED.SEVERAL E-MAILS EXCHANGED WITH LOUBELLE BOOKS STORE.I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH AMAZON AND LOUBELLLE.MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY IS PROCESSING MY DISPUTE.DO NOT SEND ANY MORE PROMOTIOAL MATERIAL TO MY E-MAIL ADDRESS.G. OEHLING
4,science for the preschooler,My grandson is 3 and very curious. I keep toys at my house for him to enjoy when he visits. One of his favorites for which he always asks is a collection of plastic 2-3inch insects. We always have lots to talk about when the insects come out. So The Icky Bug Book along with a magnifying glass was a perfect addition to our collection of insects. Lots of fun!
2,Now Being Released Separately,"When this set first came out, I really wanted to buy it. However the initial price of around $400 was way too steep and I was really only interested in Ritter Blaubart and Tales of Hoffman. Now, they're releasing the films individually. I guess they discovered that not everyone wanted to send $300-$400 at one time for possibly several movies they may not want. FYI: if you're looking for Tales of Hoffman, it's actual title is Hoffman's Erzahlungen. You won't find otherwise. I haven't received Hoffman's Erzahlungen yet, but Ritter Blaubart is total enjoyment and everyone is perfect in their roles. I gave the set only two stars, as it's really not the best value for your money."
2,Now Available Separately,"When this set first came out, it was priced way out of reach at about $350-$400. While I wanted to get it, that was a lot more than I wanted to pay and there were only a couple of the movies that I even had an interest in seeing. I was please when they started to release the movies individually. I immediately purchase Ritter Blaubart. If you're looking for Tales of Hoffman, its actually under it's German title of Hoffmans Erzahlungen."
2,not interesting at all,"Bought this w/other instructional DVD's & this is by far the least interesting any attention catching of them all. Animals?? one letter per animal & a boring, non-applicable song. No reciting, just pix and music.I don't consider this DVD an instructional video at all, look elsewhere (Richard Scary or Sesame Street)."
2,Great music but not educational,I do not like the choices of animals they use for each letter. They use animals that kids have never heard of. Only a few familier ones.
5,Glad to find it,My son who is in medical school learned his ABC's from this video and at the time we got from the library. We have been looking for this for awhile and now we have it
3,Good and bad things about this video,"Great visuals, catchy songs, unique animals but often hard to understand what animal name is being said! It would've been nice if they had put the name of the animal at the bottom of the screen or a list with the DVD. My kids (6 & 7) kept asking what animal the video was talking about and I honestly couldn't answer for some of them!"
5,Animal Alphabet Review,"My two children ages 2 and 4 love this video! It moves through the alphabet singing a song for each letter and choosing an animal that starts with that letter. The tunes are so catchy that I find myself singing them. We repeat them to each other, too. It's alot of fun. Anyone with little ones that like animals will love this video."
5,Great DVD,"This Animal Alpabet DVD is the best one i've found so far. I purchased it after reading the review on here. I have 3 children ages 8,3,and 2. After watching this dvd my 2&3 yr olds have been saying more of the alphabet and associating it with the animals.. Like A Armadillo, or D dolphin. I cant get them to stop watching it,and like somone else said, It dosent use the ordinary animals, like q for quizel . Even my 8 yr old likes watching the movie. She likes to hear all the details about the animals, and all 3 or them love to sing along with the songs. I highly recommend this , as i matter of fact i'm going to order another one for my 3yr old neices birthday."
5,Olie's fun to read!,"These books are great for younger kids. Both my 2 year old nephew and 2 year granddaughter love looking through each book and for me to read the books to them. The box is a great way to keep all the books together & we make it part of the routine, so they learn to put away their books."
4,Great Find,The book is very colorful but there isn't much of a plot line- then what do you expect from a 2 yr olds book right? I would say go for it its more of a picture book but the color quality is great for children. I purchased this for a little girl and she loves it to death. She's 3yrs old right now but still keeps reading or looking at the book. The box doesn't last long but its nice to get the entire set for this price.
3,Hit or miss,"Some songs are pretty funny, but others fall flat. Worthy of being in your collection if you have a ribald sense of humor!"
1,Not what I was led to believe,"If you want to hear the original cut of ""Angel Baby,"" this isn't for you. There are two versions,both made in the last few years. I wanted the actual song, original version. That's all I wanted. Very disappointed."
5,Great Middle Eastern Recipes,"I'm really happy with my latest cookbook, Essential Middle Eastern Cooking. A nice selection of dishes from Turkey, Lebanon, Morrocco and other Middle Eastern countries including fish, poultry, rice, lamb,and a lot of vegetarian dishes. I was very relieved almost all the ingredients were easily found in my local grocery store! The desserts are absolutely delicious. And it's really a healthy cuisine which is especially important today."
2,Not what I thought I was buying,"I searched Amazon for a torchiere lamp shade, and this item came up. So, I bought it. It's nice enough; but it's NOT a torchiere lamp shade. The hole on the bottom is too small [only 1/2"", when it needs to be about 2 1/2""]. You can't see the hole in the picture, and it is not described anywhere in the listing. The seller approved the return, but the shipping was going to be $16--too much on top of already paying shipping to get it here. When I asked the seller to share the return shipping, since the item was not clearly described, they got huffy with me and threatened to sue me for extortion. So now I'm stuck with something I can't use. Remember, seller: the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT."
1,NOT THE SAME,My husband use to wear this cologne and it was wonderful but we couldn't find it anymore in local stores. I saw it on amazon and gladly ordered it. It is not the same. It seems watered down or something. Maybe they don't use oils to make it anymore??? Don't know. All I know is what use to last all day doesn't even last a few hours now. Very disappointed.
5,Works as advertised!,"This thing works perfectly. You plug it in and you're done. It's a no-brainer.I have a 6000 sq ft building with three panels and 400 amps of service. I had the typical ""one phase can't pass X10 to the other phase"" problems that everyone complains about all the time. I got this thing and plugged it into a socket that was close to where all the power panels come together near the meter and now everything X10 works.The lights are cute, and I'd imagine helpful, but since I don't have to do any debugging, I can't say exactly how I would have used them. They flicker slowly enough that if a signal were not being repeated you could visually determine that.Save yourself a bunch of time and hassle. If you have the problem, pay the money and get the solution. Done."
4,Works as advertized but may need more,The module amplifies the X10 signal as advertized. My problem is the length of the line from the dryer to the panel. Looks like I might need an in panel unit for the best performance.
3,Interesting.,"I have to say that I do love the Carnival Overture and that it is a great way to begin this CD. The colors are splashy and bold and burst from an infectious rythmic structure that typifies excitement. The Carnival Overture makes a great introduction for the New World Symphony by presenting you with something light and joyful before being plunged into 40 minutes of serious business. I do agree with the previous reviewer in that this recording of Dvorak's 9th Symphony lacks some of the emotional punch that other recordings have. However, Previn's languid direction makes for very atmospheric listening. It is a very warm and relaxing version of the 9th - almost as if Dvorak's rugged turmoil is being passed through the softer prism of Saint-Saens."
2,Not the best examples,These are mostly obscure films at early parts of famous actors' careers. Not a classic collection at all. I regret the purchase.
3,Interesting read while I was in Burma,"It is the story about one of the many non-Burmese tribes who live in Burma, the Shan. The book is written from the view of a third person, but I believe the author was telling her own story - a bit confusing. But if you are interested in the country or plan to travel there, it is a worthwhile read!"
4,awesome addition to me bread making routine,wow! this added to my home ground flour makes bread as light and fluffy as store bought but with so much more flavor and fresher!
4,Good for vegans and bread making,"I'm not a vegan and I'm not allergic to wheat gluten. Nevertheless, I use this to make Seitan in many varieties. Extracting wheat gluten from flour is very time consuming so this is a real time saver. My favorites are Asian Seitans and faux pastrami. You can also use it to fortify some breads. If you don't know what wheat gluten is used for then don't buy it."
2,"Allergen warning should be in product description, not customer photo","I went looking on Amazon because our Wal-Mart no longer sells gluten, which I use for bread making. This is a better value than I was getting there, so I was excited. *BUT* it is processed on equipment that processes peanuts and tree nuts, which my 18 month old is allergic to. (Also says eggs and soy, but that doesn't affect her.) She loves my bread, so I don't want to use it 'just for the rest of us', but it was on the photo of the label, so I guess I can't return it. However, it definitely should be in the product description, not just on user-uploaded photos."
5,Great value for the money!,The only source for Vital Wheat Gluten available locally is a 1.5 Cup package on sale at Wal-Mart as a baking additive -- at a cost of nearly $2.00 (USD). This 3.5 pound package was a godsend as I have an entire folder of seitan recipes I've wanted to try -- and now I'm working my way deliciously through it!
4,LOTS OF FUN!,"My 2 year old loves to sing and dance along with these cute kids. The big yellow pollywog is a loveable character, too. We have several Gullah Gullah videos and enjoy them all. The friendly Daise family is very likeable, and the series teaches good lessons. The sets are also colorful and eye-catching for young children. I'd recommend it as wholesome entertainment for ages 2 to 12 (I think that's also the age range of the kids that star in the show)."
4,a satisfied costomer,I truly think it is a very good show. Better than some others I have seen and my grandchildren really enjoy it. I think angry man needs to go back where he came from and leave children shows alone. Please know that your show is appreciated by many.
1,Rusting,I have only had these on for only 7 months and they are already rusting. You advertised them as being stainless steel. I am very disappointed.
3,Somewhat redundant these days,"When this album came out in 1984, it served a great purchase. It collected the bands non-lp singles, b-sides, and BBC cuts. However, with the emergence of SINGLES, WORLD WON'T LISTEN, and especially LOUDER THAN BOMBS, its use is limited to the true fans. This is because all of the singles, and b-sides can be found on the above collections, so your left with the BBC cuts. Now, ""These Things Take Time"", ""Reel Around the Fountain"" and ""You've Got Everything Now"" are excellent in BBC form, but still pale to the originals. The rest of the cuts, including the otherwise unavailable ""Accept Yourself"" and Handsome Devil"" are rather weak. It pains me being a fan to put this album's score this low (as it was my first Smiths cd), but is necessary."
5,Clear perfect energy,Still Ill gets the honor of being my favorite songs of all time... no doubt about it. The live version on this album is even better than the debut album version. Brilliant along with the rest of the album. The album gives us the full energy of the band during the early days and still stands as strong today - many years later.
5,Hatful of Hollow,"Hatful of Hollow being a compilation album that spanns the years 1983-1984. I agree with another reviewer that this is landmark release as the quality of the tracks is astounding. Here we have my all time favourite Smiths track ""How Soon Is Now"" along with other great tracks such as ""This Charming Man"", ""Hand in Glove"" and ""William it was really nothing"". The booklet is very nice with all the lyrics included and many very nice photographs. 5/5."
5,If you can only buy one...this is it.,"I'm sure others would argue for a particular album, or perhaps Louder Than Bombs, but if you have no Smiths in your collection and you only want one album, this is it. I have the LP, it cost me $12 in the 80's (which was a lot to me at the time), and I recently bought the CD to play in my car. If there is a dissapointment on this album, it is the studio recording of What Difference Does it Make? which bugged me when I first bought the album (one of my favorite songs by them at the time...again, in the 80's) - but as I've gotten older, it is actually refreshing.This Charming Man has easily one of the best guitar/bass melodies to come out of the 80's, How Soon is Now? is impeccable and utterly listenable...the band shows great range, with its melancholic and yet punkish approach to music. Hatful of Hollow is their best."
2,Balls,"I bought this album a year ago instead of 'Meat Is Murder', because I had heard 'How Soon Is Now' on the radio and I figured I should get the original album that it was released on rather than 'Meat Is Murder'. I was wrong. Although there are some witty lyrics and tricks of the tongue found here, very few of the tracks vary at all from one consistant vein of music, the same guitar riffs, the same vocal 'ah-ha-ha's. The album is very boring, I won't lie. I tried listening to it about a dozen times and every time I thought 'when will this side end?'. Now, I'm not completely putting down The Smiths. Get 'Meat Is Murder' if you like 'How Soon Is Now'. It blows this compilation out of the water. This compilation of B sides and outtakes of the first album should've stayed in the archives."
2,Basic law of attraction,"If you read any of the law of attraction books you don't need this one, unless you want to read the original version. It seems everyone else copied from here but how many times do we need to read it."
5,Alain Delon - Five Film Collection,Alain Delon is a Great French icon. All his movies are worth watching over and over.
4,Good value for less well known AlainDelon work,"This is a very good collection of the less well known works of Alain Delon. And it includes The Swimming Pool with Romy Schneider & Jane Birkin. But like any collected works, if you are not a Delon fan it may be hard going for some. I think he is a terrific screen actor and the five films in this collection add to his repertoire of, say, the hero as outsider...Delon has an interiority totally unique & compelling. He's fabulous to watch! Voila."
3,Good to have it,"This collection of Alain Delon is good because it has several films not very popular starred by this French actor. The quality of DVDs is good in general with a good presentation. All DVDs are spoken in French and subtitled in English and Spanish. However, the DVD with the film ""The swimming pool"" (La piscine) has a shortcoming, you must see it with both subtitles on, i.e. English and Spanish together something that does not happen in the other two DVDs. This inconvenience should be avoided in similar collections, e.g. Catherine Deneuve."
4,Bock Does It Again,"I own several of Darrell Bock's other commentaries. I do not always agree with everything he says, but I always learn a lot when I read his work. He does a great job of balancing theological details, historical context, language issues and practical application.The Gospel of Luke speaks powerfully to Christ's call to the help the poor and needy. Bock brings that out and explains it well. If you can only afford one commentary on Luke, this is the one to invest in."
3,good for a beginner,Judith is always so good at being very clear with descriptions. I am a huge a fan of hers. This book is very good for beginners. If you are looking for a really good workout for your abs this is not the book.
3,Not Enough Ab Work,"Good, but not great -- and from experience, I know it is easy to cheat abdominal work during yoga. This is a nice, soothing explanation of core work. However, I would want a bit more explanation. Yoga abdominal work is only half of the issue. You need a mid-body, front and back, work out in yoga to balance the musculature and create that lovely flat tummy. I didn't see much of that here. However, Ms. Lasater definitely knows her stuff and definitely knows her audience. Good book overall."
4,"Don't Totally Agree, But Still A Good Book","As a Pro Trainer and Self Transformed 'Fat Kid', I don't totally agree that 'flat abs, etc. is not natural'.Having lived through my personal transformation, I know first hand how natural it can be.That being said, this book gives a great perspective on a subject that many people struggle with. Any exerciser will be able to get something out of this book, as this subject area still needs more experts to educate the general public.Add it to your fitness library.Joey Atlas - The Wizard of Fitness[...]"
1,inexpensive for a reason,"I usually enjoy Lasater's books. My teacher training required us to have one of them, and I found it useful, this book to me was a waste of a perfectly good amazon gift certificate.There was no new information, it reitterated all of the information I already knew, and I found it did not actually hold that many asanas, ie: stand tall and raise your leg out in front of you to strengthen the psoas - kind of like padangusthasana, but honestly - I already knew this - and several other modifications of poses. I guess I just had high hopes of more complex series. This is a book best for the layperson with little knowledge of anatomy and yoga who needs help to figure some things out."
2,Old Jeff,"Yeah the guitar work is at JW standard. The major problem I have with this album is its a catalog at the back, its clear waters has sold out. That is un-metal. The first track is by far the best. The lyrics on most tracks are cheesier and worse than normal. 2 stars for the guest appearances and just coz its jeff. The musical quality of the album deserves more but for jeff on the whole this is a 2. as always, go for his older work"
1,Not Worth It,"Bought my daughter this toy for her 4th birthday. The extra slips of clues would not stay in their place, and within a few minutes, she had totally lost intrest in it. The cards were extremely hard to get back into the box and so I'm always the one having to put the toy back together. The little magnifying glass doesn't work very well either. I was very disappointed in the toy."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this toy for my son's 3rd birthday. He is a HUGE Blue's Clues fan. I had hoped this toy would be good for keeping him busy on long car rides too. Needless to say he unwrapped it, studied it, juggled the inserts and the magnifying glass, and then tossed it aside. I showed him how to use it and tried to play it with him but no luck. He picked it up a few days later only to dismantle the clue strips from the inserts. These of course are all lost now. My 16-month-old showed a little more enthusiasm for the toy since she recognizes the characters but after a couple of weeks both kids are disinterested."
2,It's okay,"This toy did not hold my 2 year olds interest very long. Neither did it hold the interest of my 4 and 5 yr old children. They liked it for a little while (about 15 minutes), but have not touched it since then. They don't seem interested in playing it the way it was intended. I think its a little too difficult for kids."
2,Fun for about 20 minutes,"My 4 year old daughter played with it for about 20 minutes and now it's at the bottom of her toy box. She enjoyed finding the clues and then we played our own ""I Spy"" version, but it didn't take long for her to get bored with it. The plastic is durable, but the pictures are paper and if they happen to get wet or spilled on they are toast."
1,BORRRRING...,"My 4-year-old got this for his second birthday a couplr years ago, thought the magnifying glass was pretty cool for about 5 minutes, and then it sat in the toybox until this spring when his now 2-year-old brother found it. He had almost the same reaction. It was fun to peek through the magnifying glass for a couple of minutes, then it was back in the toybox for this. i sold it...at a garge sale..."
1,This ended up in the trash.,"My wife had no issues with the fit of this costume, BUT: On opening the package, we discovered that one of the wires holding up the halo was broken, and one end of the elastic strap for the wings was dangling loose. Simpler to fix these issues myself than deal with a return. It seemed like everything would be okay after that. Unfortunately, the seam that runs the length of the sleeve came apart when my wife reached out of the car window at the ATM en route to her sister's house before the party. She borrowed a costume from her sister and threw this one in the trash.Buyer beware. You get what you pay for, right?"
1,Disappointed,"I bought this costume, based on the one review it had, regarding size. I am a 12 above the waist, and a 12/14 bottom, depending on the garment. When the previous reviewer said it was too big for her, but worked for a size 16 woman, I ordered with confidence that it would be fine. It's not. It was, at best, a size 10 or smaller. The ""angel"" side, with the long sleeve, split at the seam, the second I put it on. The dress bottom was not long enough to wear without boy-shorts, or bike shorts, or *something* underneath, as it didn't come down long enough to cover anything. I didn't expect it to be high quality for the price, but I expected to be able to wear the costume I bought. Thankfully, I ordered it early enough, that I can purchase another costume to wear for my event. It will go in the trash, only having partially gotten it on, in the first 10 minutes of opening."
4,Great Animal Images,"We have both Animal Numbers and the Animal Alphabet (which is the better of the two) and enjoy both. Time Life put these out and they do have some fantastic animal footage that is both entertaining and educational. Our 4 year old absolutely loves both DVDs to the point of exhaustion. Our 2 year old gets a little bored because they are a little too advanced for him. Both videos use animals to express the concepts of numbers or letters. Through repetition and humor, the child learns sequencing in this video. Although I recommend the Alphabet Numbers DVD, IMHO the Animal Alphabet is far superior and would be an asset to any child's DVD collection."
4,My kids didn't like,"The video shows lots of jungle animals with the numbers and counts. I thought it was educational. They showed the animal and played a song and told about the animal. My kids seem to like videos that tell a story. My children were not really into just watching animals only. But, if your children love to watch REAL animals then they might like this one. I thought it was very educational."
5,Expressive modern dance,"David Parsons not only owns the dance company, but is also the sole choreographer. The troops are all experienced perfomers and dancers, and the theme of each dance piece is so expressive and overt, I use this DVD when introducing ballet and dance to a novice. Most of the performers, and especially David Parsons, exhibit the decipline and skill to dance classical ballet if required."
5,A rousing good read,"I read this after I got ""The Perfect Storm"" and got interested in sailing. Tilman is well-known as being one of the few explorers who were good writers. I wish his Asian travels books were still in print."
3,Not for '67 Eldo,"All the sites seem to show this as a '67 Eldorado upper hose. It's the right shape, but it's too short! Go with a flex hose til they start making them again. HTH, Jeff Willington Cadillac"
5,A great live album,"This 1998 recording finds OP once again reunited with Ray Brown and Milt Jackson. Also joining them is drummer Karriem Riggins, from Ray Brown's trio. It must have been wonderful to have been in the audience at the Blue Note during this recording session. I have seen OP on a concert stage before, but to hear him in an intimate setting like a jazz club must be the experience of a life time. Not to mention Milt and Ray. And so, for those of us who were not fortunate enough to be there, this then is the next best thing. The sound is awesome, and if you turn down the lights and close your eyes..with a little imagination you will be there at the Blue Note."
5,Top Shelf,this is a very good easy listening Group with just the right sounds for almost anyone that appreciates music. It is refreshing to say the least. I am just speechless.
1,To call this a piece of garbage would be an insult to garbage.,"This has to be the most pathetic subwoofer ever created. The enclosure is not at all tuned correctly and the puny 4 inch speaker can't handle any frequecy below 80Hz without totally distoring (yes even at the lowest volume settings). 50 watts? Yah Right... Maybe 50 Watts instantaneous peak at 125Hz, but not even close to 50 watts where you need it.Do not waste your money on this junk. Save up for a little while longer and get something from a company that does not hide their true specifications."
3,Cool Customer,"True, this may not be as ardent as Levi's reading of Sibelius' 2nd Symphony, but lost cause it's not. On the 1st Symphony, Levi stands back giving the orchestra the room to ruminate over the opening movement; a tour-de-force opening. The scherzo is animated with a lightly unbalanced, wandering feel. I will fault Levi during the slower, quiet passages. His back-seat-driver technique sounds at times as if he's nodding off. He regains consciousness for the 5th, but both symphonies do suffer from a dreamy, highly romanticized rendering. The sonics, however, are top notch and the disc can be recommended based on the opening movement of the 1st Symphony alone."
5,Mandy Moore is the best!,I love Mandy Moore she's my role model and her cd and all the songs on it rock!
4,It's cute and fun!,"I saw Mandy Moore open up for *N Sync at Jones Beach this summer and she was awesome! Her song without a doubt has a pop feel, but doesn't come close to the corniness factor of Britney Spears's Soda Pop"
4,A Great Up And Coming Star,"With my favorite star of all time, Britney Spears, everywhere, it's hard to see if Mandy will go anywhere. Christina Aguilera became a star because of a style all her own. Mandy's is much like Britney's when she started. Will she flourish? I hope so. The song ""Candy"" is catchy, and the rest of the album sounds promising. Go Mandy!"
1,What is the world coming to?,"Honestly, can this actually be classified as music? This song makes me want to throw up my candy. I dont think ive ever heard a worse song. I cringe when i think of what the full album must be like. Mandy Moore is the biggest panflash ever, and in a couple of months, she will be gone. She sings just as bad as Britney Spears, but at least brittney spears's songs dont make you want to litteraly chop off your ears! Pop music has gotten to be embarrinsingly bad! The only good pop music album was ""Music Box"" by Mariah Carey, and even Mariahs stuff has gotten pretty scary. Mandy, if your reading this, here's a tip: Keep your day job, cuz honey, your gonna need it!"
5,Mandy Moore's Album Is definitely a MUST BUY! I LOVE IT!,"Mandy Moore is the Best-Singing, the Coolest, Sweetest of all time. I have never heard such a GREAT singer. Mandy is BEST ever! I love EVERY single song in the album, Mandy's voice is so unique and just amazing! Mandy has got a real voice, I'm telling you, I love Mandy's songs very very much, so I listen Mandy's songs almost all day! The Best! Buy the album you will like it. Signed Bill"
5,Excellent Debut,"This was an excellent debut single by Mandy Moore. It will always be one of my favorite songs. Mandy is so talented, both at singing and dancing. I'm sure she's a great actress too. I can't wait to see her in The Princess Diaries."
2,"Same old, same old. . .","Mandy Moore is very much in the style of Britney Spears, peppy, uptempo dance tunes, with a nasal/throaty singing voice. I suppose if you're looking for another Britney Spears, you'll enjoy this song. That said, Mandy Moore brings nothing new to the table, her voice is very weak, and the song is nothing more thatn cookie-cutter bubblegum pop. In response to the poster below, Mandy Moore doesn't even deserve to be compared to Christina Aguilera or Jessica Simpson, both of whom have quite strong voices. I suppose all the teenyboppers will flock to this song, but it's nothing special, in my opinion."
5,Candy is Candy,"Mandy Moore is a great artist and her album is coming out January 11, 2000. If you love the single like I do, then you will be getting the cd on the day it comes out like I will."
5,I LUV THIS SONG!,~ I think this song is really good. I cant believe that Mandy is only 15 I thought she was much older. I havent seen the Music Video but I bet it is really good ~
5,Even the sun doesn't shine as brightly as her voice,"When I played the single ""candy"" I found myself breaking down in tears. My mother asked me why I was crying and when I told her it was because ""candy"" was absolutely beautiful, she laughed and said it was silly to cry over a song. Then I made her listen to it, and she broke down crying too. I know a lot of people think Mandy Moore has no substance, that she is a cookie-cutter blonde, but this is a really deep song. Listen to it carefully. Read the lyrics. I guarantee if you have a heart, if you are human, you will be moved by this beautiful music."
1,"see you in rehab, Mandy","One good thing always comes from these cookie-cutter stars who are given deals because some record exec demands it.....we'll all be seeing Mandy in drug rehab with Britney, Christina, Vitamin C and those Hanson kids in a few years. This little, talentless girl is gonna fall hard when in 4 months, the bubblegum revolution is over and they yank that cute little VW bug out from under her."
3,great dance song,"okay well what can u say about this cd. it is a great one, espically if u like britany and christina! but if u don't then this is not the cd for u"
1,sucks!,"Candy is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. Mandy Moore is just trying to copy Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Now, to me, Britney Spears is just a little too full of herself and her music. Christina Aguilera has talent, and her songs make sense. Mandy Moore is just trying to immitate the two. Get a life!"
5,MANDY IS GREAT,"MANDY'S FIRST U.K. SINGLE""CANDY"" IS GREAT. I LIKE THE IMPORT SINGLE. FROM WHAT I HEARD IT IS DOING GREAT OVERSEAS. GOOD LUCK MANDY,I LOVE THE VIDEO""WALK ME HOME""."
1,yuck! I'm so sick of this pop junk!,"Will the record companies pleazzzz stop! I'm gettin' so tired of all these blonde chicks shaking their chest and stomach in their videos. Maybe this chick does have some talent, but she's gonna depend more on oohhh I'm from Orlando, ohhh, I'm blonde and luvvvv pop music, and that ditzy smile and laugh, she's jusst a puppet on strings. Her single does show a little talent from her, but she wants to be in pop because she's got nowhere else to go. She'll probably be the next Britney and rumors of her having implants will come around too. I just wanna ask the pop fans this, do u like the music or the looks?"
5,Clean performances,"John O'Conor's performances of Beethoven (and Schubert) are very very good. They're smooth with excellent expression of the dynamics along with clean virtuoso technique. He plays very professional. Trust me, I would know, I've been playing since i was 3 and not even any of my piano instructors can perform beethoven (and schubert) as well as he does. :) Artists e.g. kempff (not to be confused with kempf), sylvia capova, vladimir ashkenazy, bella davidovich, claudio arrau, and so forth do not play these at descent tempo, and sound as if they are struggling to maintain the rhythm. I'm not saying that these other performers don't play well, because they play certain songs very well, just not beethoven's sonatas. for instance, sylvia capova sucks at playing 18th-century classical music but she rocks at performing 19th-century romantic music. :)"
5,WOW,"Man where to begin on this album. It is incredible from both a lyrical point of view (with PH delivering some of the illest flows) and a production point(marco cuts it up nice on every track).PH lyrics range from everyday life and times, to dissin wack mcs and also a humurous shot at 50cent!! it is very hard to pick standout tracks as they all rock but if i had to i would say track 5 Grenades is the illest (featuring wordsworth so u know its dope!) Dont sleep, close this page and buy this album now and get a blessing from PH to you!"
5,"First heard it last night, purchased it today. EXCELLENT.","This album is just packed with EXCELLENT beats, and Pumpkinhead's ridiculous flow (given he is overweight) impresses.. his lyrics continually impress, but don't over-assault the listener.This album has one undeniable classic, the creeping 'Authentic'.Purchase this. This is along the lines of such classics as Madvillainy."
5,Pumpkinhead is one of the best!,Classic underground album here. Great lyrics and ill production. A must have for any true hip-hop fan.
3,More of the same,"I know, I know, not every album can be BlackStar--but let's compare for a moment. Why do two albums about the same general subject matter (uplifting the black man, putting food on the table, falling in love, raising a family, dodging the land mines of crack, guns, and crooked cops in the ghetto) sound so different? Cadence, rhythm, timing, and most important, cleverness that verges on pure genius in the utilization of similes and metaphors. Although Pumpkinhead has great production, and thankfully is one less MC rhyming about [...]/drugs/bling/etc., his lyrics only hint at these things.I put this album in the category of onebelo or Hangar 18 or Pete Miser: talented artists all, with a gem or two here and there, but lacking that certain something that makes you wear out the CD."
1,I didn't get it.,I didn't get why this book was written at all. The author associated everything about her life with Harry Potter. I was going to do a report about her but then I couldn't find many important facts about her life. The facts that were in the book were all jumbled up and unorganized. Half of the magazine articles written about Ms. Rowling are better than this. It's not very helpful with report either. Don't spend your the time reading or purchasing this book. It's a waste of time and money. Go read the Harry Potter series instead.
2,Good book but a little dissapointing,"Although the book was highly informative, it did not tell much more than what was already said in many interviews. Due to the fact that it was not an official biography he simply took the sources interviews and turned them into a book. I did not feel that the book was worth spending time reading. I also felt that the author was a little confused with some of the details in the books when he stated that owls run banks (although this may be a difference in the British and U.S. versions, the books say that goblins run Gringotts) he also states a few incoorect names. All in all the book is good for someone who has never read a single interview with J.K. Rowling. Don't expect any big shocking secrets no more has been revealed than the interview with scholastic and a few British magazines."
1,Don't bother ....,"The author can't even be bothered to correct Rowling's birthdate in this ""revised and updated"" edition!!! It's a *biography* and he doesn't even have the subject's birthdate correct. Sean Smith's biography of Rowling is far superior. This one shouldn't even be on the market, and I can't fathom why large chains are stocking it."
1,Poorly Researched and Written,"Unfortunate but true - the author clearly has not read the Harry Potter books themselves. The ""writing"" itself is painfully stilted and gives the strong impression that scant facts have been surrounded by stock ""fantasy"" adjectives and adverbs and then bluntly tacked onto a generic ""bio"" outline.I'd heard that this wasn't a great bio but while waiting for the Half-Blood Prince I broke down and bought it anyhow thinking ""Just how bad could it be?"" The answer is ""very."" I urge you not to make the same mistake. However many times you've read the books themselves you'd be much better off reading them again than reading this."
1,Jumping on the bandwagon,"This book is shockingly bad. It is appallingly written, has very little content, many errors, and is highly repetitive. By the author's own admission, it is merely a collection of facts gathered from published articles and interviews, and official and unofficial web sites; in other words, Marc Shapiro has found an easy way to make easy money, by gathering public information (and not very much of it) in a short, unsatisfactory book riddled with errors (Knight's Cross Station in London? There is no such place, in reality or Rowling's fiction.) If you really want to know as much about JK Rowling as you can, this book is perhaps easier than your own internet research, but do not expect to discover anything new or surprising, do not expect to enjoy the read, and bear in mind that Joanne Rowling has not validated a single word in the book."
1,Dissapointing,While this book gave me a better idea of the life of J.K. Rowling I was very disappointed with Marc Shapiro's writing. The whole time I was reading I found myself wondering if Shapiro had actually read the Harry Potter books. A devoted fan of the Harry POtter series I noticed right away the many mistakes Shapiro made while talking about the books themselves. A note of advice DO NOT spend money on this book!!! Get it from the library if you want to read it. It isnt worth even the few dollars you may spend on it!
2,No new information.,"All that is in here is what you can find on JK Rowling's website. Only if you have no access to an internet connection, and you haven't read her previous interviews, then this book would be informative to you. Otherwise, save your money."
1,"Needed To Do Homework, Gave Away To Much!","I didn't like the typos, I didn't like the inaccuracies, and for god sake don't give away so many spoilers. I hadn't read the fifth book and he gave away something crucial, thanks alot. I wanted to read about Ms. Rowling, if I wanted parts of the book ruined I would have asked someone in my home who read the book to do it thanks."
1,Nothing new,"The writing style leads me to believe that this book is written for older elementary school age to middle school age children, so thankfully it was a quick read. The entire book is just a piecing together of interviews. Marc Shapiro has never interviewed J.K. Rowling himself. So there wasn't anything new or all that interesting in the book if you've read the interviews JKR has given over the years.Shapiro also does a very lazy job of updating the book by just tacking on new material every couple of years to the end.Overall, it was a disappointment."
2,Could've been better,"I checked this book out from the library hoping to learn more about JK Rowling, but I was disappointed. It provided very little about her, more about Harry Potter than anything else. Most of what's in here you can find in interviews she has done in the past.Something that really irritated me was the constant jumping around this book did. It would be describing something at a specific period in JK's life, then jump ahead 5 years and describe something else, then jump back 8 years, and so on. That was really confusing at first and really irritating. There are probably much better books, don't bother reading this, you won't learn anything new."
2,Poorly Written Drivel,"I was unable to finish this book due to the glaring errors and poor craftsmanship. I should have realized that any author who listed People magazine as a model of respected journalism was not to be trusted; still, I let my curiosity get the best of me. Finally, I determined that I could, in fact, be reading ONLY what could be described as an UN-authorized biography; and a re-read of the front cover of the book confirmed my desperate diagnosis. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this book stinks; it reads like a ghastly farce of a paper cut-n-copy fan-zine. I should like to see what a more capable author (not to mention editor and proofreader) would do with such interesting material."
1,Major Errors,I belive that the man who wrote this book did not read the books at all or he did not know what he was doing.On the second time of reading it. I read that the bank was ran by owls.How can owls run a bank?I was taught by a published writer it is best to make sure the book is free of grammarical errors so it apears to be professional.I wonder did he edit the book or have an editor edit them?
1,"""In the world of Harry Potter, owls run banks"" pg. 7.","Anyone who has read even one Harry Potter book knows that owls carry mail and that the bank is run by goblins. Any fourth grader could tell you so. ""Author"" Marc Shapiro claims to love Harry Potter and J.K. Rowling. He hasn't even had the decency to read one of the books before writing this piece of meaningless swill.Wait for a better biography....this one is like reading the national enquirer."
5,a through biography,JK Rowling is one of the greatest writers of our time or of any other time. Her journey to produce Harry Potter is presented here in a thoroughly researched fashion.
1,"The National Enquirer of ""Biographies""","My daughter got this book out of her high school library to use as one of the required book references for an English paper. It is so filled with misinformation and bungled facts that it actually made us angry that it got published. The author got some of the most basic facts wrong like the year of her birth, why she is called J.K., and why she wrote in cafes. Really, he could have gotten better information for his research using Wikipedia. Do not waste your time or money on this useless piece of trash! Anyone interested in researching J.K. Rowling can find multiple articles online in which she is actually interviewed, as well as by looking up her own Bio site. She is a writer who made an impact on the world. This writer just used her name to make some money."
4,Good,"If you don't know much about JK Rowling,then you would like this book.However,I keep up with any interviews that she's been in,so I knew about half of the info.Buy it if you haven't read much about Joanne."
5,peaceable kingdom the journey home,this is a must see film it was so emotional and if you have a love for animals you will understand if you don't you will soon understand they are all like us and they have feelings to what a wonderful movie i will share this with ever on i know
5,Perfect for Christmas!,"This is such a great cd featuring great Christmas classics buy hot artist. They include Aly and A.J., Aliana Lohan (Lindsay's lil' sister), Jesse McCartney and Hilary Duff. I highly reccommend this cd because it is great for the holidays or even throughout the year. Some of the singer's know the music businness for some it's all new like for Aliana Lohan this is her music debut singing ""Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree"" which is the reason I bought the cd. I heard about it on MYV's Total Request Live (TRL). Trust me you will not be sad with this great buy."
5,our Boston Terrior loves it,"Our BT loves this frisbee and it's her only toy that she will play with other than her bones. It is very well made and keeps her teeth (along with the bones) in tip top shape, never having to have a vet clean them. Highly recommend."
2,Condition,When I opened the package I was disappointed to see the condition of this book. It was all bent up and had stains all over it. The only good part about the book is that it is still readable. I really wish the book was in a good condition like they said it was going to be.
4,"The Chalice (The Sword, the Ring, and the Chalice, Book 3)",Purchased the entire set of three excellent condition and good reading! Thank you for the quick delivery too.
3,Weakest installment in the entire trilogy,"This wasn't a satisfying conclusion to Chester's ""The Sword, The Ring, and the Chalice"" Trilogy. It did have some good moments, and the tension really did have a high level in some parts. But there wasn't enough action to start with. Also, some obvious cliches that are rampant in many fantasy novels are found here. The story didn't seem to wrap up when I reached the end, and numerous sequences throughout the book didn't have the artistic quality that Chester conveyed in the last two books.But it wasn't a total loss. The intensity in the story remained as I read through, and the characters (excluding the cliched ones) kept me interested.This wasn't a totally satisfying conclusion, but I still like the trilogy in general, despite its few flaws.Grade: C"
5,Most Excellent!!!!!!!,"I have read all three of the books in The Sword, The Ring, and The Chalice. They are just breath taking. The only regret that I have is the ending seems to soon, not unless Ms. Chester is going to continue the story in another book or series? I hope that she will consitter continueing the story about Dain and Alexieka, I would love to see if they rebuild Nether."
1,plotting by the numbers with a horrible conclusion.,"The Sword was okay, not good, not bad, passable enough. The Ring was pretty good, I enjoyed it. Not top flight fantasy like Martin or Keyes, but still pretty well done. I had high hopes then for the Chalice. Sadly, those hopes were dashed by page 50. Just not a good book that wrapped up 700 pages of prologue in literally 15 pages. The ending was way too rushed, and just not good.The one redeeming quality of this book is Prince Gavril, who despite being one of the biggest jerks around, is far more interesting than Faldain. Without spoiling the end of this book, if you have read more than 2 fantasy series, you can already guess the conclusion. In fact, you can probably tell exactly what will happen 100 pages into the book.This put such a bad taste into my mouth that I won't be reading Queen's Gambit."
4,The Chalice,Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I read the Chalice in an afternoon. I look foward to reading more books by Deborah Chester.
5,worth reading,I read her three books of this series and they were pretty good I enjoy them. Lot of imagination it kept you going. I read more of her books
1,Awful,"I am aware its cheap, but it immediately started to curl on one of the corners. Even after I purchased rug grippers the rug didn't stay put and continued to curl. I suggest paying a bit extra and getting a rug that is twice the quality."
1,Piece of Junk,"The Troy Bilt Horse tiller arrived in an inoperable condition. When you tried to engage the transmission it would just burn up the drive belts. Trans would not Turn. Black gasket silicon material from a previous repair, tines off machine, gas residue in tank. Outdoor store shipped a tiller with a bad trans, I dropped it off to a local dealer service center about a month ago, still in shop. I ordered a new tiller got a tiller with a bad trans right out of the crate. Piece of junk, $1830.00 for a piece of junk. Don't buy from outdoor store through Amazon, they would not allow return."
1,This items DOES NOT convert to a Toddler Bed!! Beware,"Now that my daughter is old enough for a toddler bed, I have just realized that this bed does not convert. Be careful when you purchase this bed. It only converts to a full-sized bed."
3,Nice crib,"This is a very nice crib, it was easy to assemble, but the simmons mattress that we purchased was too small for this simmons crib. We exchanged it for a sealy mattress that fits a lot better, but is still a little small. This crib seems to be deeper than standard cribs."
1,Haven't received it!,"Well, they ask me to review I product I haven't gotten. That is pretty funny. I ordered this crib on 1 month ago and still haven't received it. I think that would classify as a 1 star. Customer service has been poor because they can't tell me anything. They don't really know were the crib is or when it will get here. They are all estimations. In my experience if you need a crib fast this is not the place."
5,Cool!,You don't know how exited to hear that one of the girls I have been danceing with for years is now a star. I was the first to get there autogragh. I never saw them as famous kind of people but I knew they had a lot of talent and I didn't know that they would really turn out to be my heros. Good Luck guys!
5,by Christine,May Bird is a ten year old girl who lives in Briery Swamp. May Bird doesn't know that about fifteen people disappeared in the lakes of Briery Swamp many years ago. Then one day May falls into the lake and lands in the ever after. May Bird must get out fast!This book is really good. My favorite part is when May Bird meets the undertaker!
5,What an adventure!,"My daughter is not a reader. I bought her this book though (as with many others) in hopes that something will set off a spark and have her wanting to read. For some reason (I'm sure it was the wonderful artwork on the cover) she was attracted to this one. Once her nose was in the book, you almost never saw it leave. She absolutely loved it. So much so that I decided I needed to read it too. I adored the book. Jodi Lynn Anderson does such a good job at spinning a wonderful tale of the Ever After. She makes the story a little creepy but not too much and makes you care about the characters you are reading about. I found my nose stuck in the book most of the time too."
3,Imagination galore,"Several girls in my class are reading this book. As their teacher, I thought I had better keep up. This book is filled with imagination. I do wish the settings were described in more detail. Sometimes my mental image got a little fuzzy. Overall, a good read."
3,A pleasant read,"May Bird and the Ever After was a fun read for a rainy afternoon. May is a plucky girl who plunges into a magic lake and starts seeing ghosts. Shortly thereafter, she is pulled into the Ever After (the after life) by a series of creepy events, and spends the rest of the book seeking a way home which may or may not exist.My favorite character is May's cat Somber Kitty, who faithfully follows May into the unknown, and spends much of the book trying to find her. He's just as plucky as May, and their reunion is touching.Three stars for a fun, slightly creepy read. May whines a bit too much for my taste in the first few chapters and it takes her forever to warm up to the house ghost who saved her life, which is a bit annoying. But she comes around in the end, so I decided to move on to Book 2 to find out what happens to May when she heads North."
2,"Okay, however...","It's not a bad story. I picked this up at the Scholastic book fair. The cover on the book I have, which is quite different from the one pictured here, did NOT mention that this was the beginning of a series. I don't mind a cliff hanger, but I prefer to know what I'm getting into when I buy one. Just out of sheer pique, I will NOT be waiting to follow up with this series. I hate sneaks."
4,thought it would be better,"This is a good cd but the lead single off of it was kinda weak. I was suprised in DMX I thought that it would be a little bit better. The best songs on here are State To State Blackchild feat. Ja Rule, We Got Trick Daddy feat. Trina, the three six mafia joint, memphis bleek, and mack 10 feat. Ca$h Money ypu have to cop this cd if you haven't yet!"
4,Sweet Cd,"If you saw the movie Exit Wounds, and agree that it was good, you will realize that you need to hear the same beats that were palying throught out the movie. If you like rap you should deffinitly get this cd to add to your collection."
4,great soundtrack,"anyone who likes rap music is surely going to like this album. and if you got a system, it'll surely slam with nice bass."
3,Wasn't bad,"I recently bought this cd, it was pretty good, some songs were crap some were good, like DMX's ""Ain't no Sunshine"", which is one of my favourites on this soundtrack. Mostly it has a bunch of great rappers,rapping guys and swearing. I thought it was good but not the best, but if your into the whole rap thing like me which i like as well go for it."
5,Stop comparing it to donnie darko....,"Idiots. Donnie darko is a trainwreck that people think is a masterpiece. The chumbscubber IS a masterpiece that the simple minded or those who are overly smart minded can't get into and thus call it garbage.I can understand someone not loving it; but to hate it...you must have something wrong with you.Anywho haters aside. The movie is dark satire. Brilliantly acted, somewhat confusing c story that doesn't really have anything to do with anything else in the movie, dolphins, and a handful of ackward moments.If you are fans of ""black"" comedy or dark social satire than this is a movie for you. If you're a fan of dee dee dee level comedies than you won't like this; or perhaps i should say if you hate the cable guy (with jim carrey) you won't like this movie."
3,Ok movie,"I just bought this movie at the big ""Mart"" store for $3.98 last week, I was so suprised to see how much amazon is charging for this movie!! I had never seen it and thought for the price of renting I could own it so tried it, but it really is only o.k. I've seen worse. (I liked a couple songs on the sound track and was looking for that when I noticed the DVD and couldn't believe how much it is selling for $24.99 today)"
2,"Remember ""Mars Attacks!""?","""The Chumscrubber"" is yet another example of a movie that proves that an All Star cast can't make up for a lame story/script. Even first-time director Arie Posin was surprised to be able to get Glenn Close for a role. I guess she doesn't mind slumming every now and then. But I hate to see a great young actor like Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliot"") misspend his time and talent this way.The creators of this movie evidently think it has ""a lot going on"", but essentially ""The Chumscrubber"" is just disconnected and incoherent drivel and blather. See it only if you wish to waste your time by watching accomplished actors waste theirs."
1,Yuck!,"Even charming stars like Jason Isaacs and others could not save this silly, inept script. One wonders who in Hollywood really doesn't know anything at all about Americans other that dumb Californians who don't know that ""All the nuts roll West"" is the true psychological theory about how crazy California really is. Putting out such trash films shows the reality of that theory which is taught in college psych classes everywhere."
4,anyone know the song,loved the movie wouldn't give it a five but there are only a few movies i would. By the way anyone know the song playing in deans stereo when he is trashing his room. I'm going crazy trying to figure it out.
2,I wish I was American Beauty meets Donnie Darko,"An awful name for an awful movie....well almost.As over the top this movie is, it's too over the top to be even laughed at. In a pathetic attempt to be edgy and a vehicle for insight into the plastic world of middle class suburbia, it just comes off as pretentious and unsympathic. I don't get the characters motivations, except for the bullies. The one thing that actually saves this movie from the pit of despair is the acting, Fiennes, Miller, Janney Closer, were nothing short of superb and all of the kids were really great. Oh and the soundtrack kicks ass. The ending? in two words pretentious melodrama. If Meredith Baxter and Kirk Cameron were in it this would of made a great, wonderful Lifetime movie. Someone lost a bet with Posin and I guess it was Dreamworks."
4,lighten up,"Jeez, some people (other reviewers) just do not get it . This is a black comedy, the key word here is ""comedy"", so many things will be quite quirky and strange/underground/dark, not within the spectrum of our daily lives like a characature in film format. This may not be five star stuff, but any movie that keeps my attention, and makes me wonder just what the hell is going to happen next, gets my approval to recommend it to others. Just rent it, and many of you will want to buy it, in order to see the looks on your friends faces as they watch it for the first time. A great watch, and that's what really matters here. I actually bought it by accident. A sleeper underground hit, in my opinion...but you know what peeps say about opinions...haha."
2,Bologna,"This movie would be unable to exist at all were it not for the absurd caricatures of middle class suburban dwellers. Goes beyond believability, relies very heavily on unusual and unlikely situations to make its point. I know, I know, it's supposed to be dark humor, but I've seen plenty of films criticize the 'burbs better(""Poltergeist"", ""American Beauty"",""Blue Velvet"")."
2,I admit it - I don't get it...,"You'd think I'd learn eventually. If a movie is described as a 'dark satire' or 'dark comedy' - I won't get it. Granted, I'm a 45-year-old mother of two (not exactly 'hip') but this movie just seemed weird to me.The only reason I don't give it one star is because of the fine actors and actresses in it. Unfortunately, most of their talents are wasted (except for Glenn Close).All in all, just a strange movie that I did not enjoy."
2,Pompous and Stupid,"I can't agree with the reviews that have emphasized that this film is somehow ""real"". Neither the teenagers nor the adults in this snoozefest reminded me of anyone I know or have ever known and yes, I grew up in the suburbs as well.Of course none of this would matter if the story weren't stupid beyond all belief. I'm tacking on the second star because the acting actually wasn't bad, but then again it's not hard to stand out against a painted backdrop."
1,"Into the Murk, This Trail is Ended. G'night, Cinematic Failure #83,037...","A more aptly entitled film never crossed my macadam. This movie is the reason why I am looking forward to the Poseidon Adventure re-make with Kurt Russell. ""Chumscrubber"" is awful and anyone who sees this movie should scoop out his/her eyes with an emory board afterwards."
2,"GREAT cast, not a great movie...","I rented this because I thought such a great cast would hopefully mean it was a good movie, and it sounded interesting, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. (As always - bad script = bad movie.) It has a few moments here and there, but mostly it's kind of a mess. It's too bad; I have to wonder what attracted these really excellent actors to it, but I suppose they all have mortgages to pay too! LOL The youngsters in the cast are as good as the more experienced older actors. I would give the cast 5 stars, the movie only 2."
2,What is this?,"Heard all these good reviews about Chumscrubber then when I did watch it wondered why I had bothered.To me, it just seems like it is trying to be meaningful but my problem is that it is set in today's society. Nowadays the culture for ""perfect appearance"" primarily held by the media contests with ""embracing one's faults or differences"")--there is less of perfect appearance culture now as opposed to earlier (Think 1950s) and in any case for a satire I don't think they went far enough down that track. The main problem is that in order to be profound, well...you need to have some content. Some NEW content. If you are looking for a film which tries to achieve an edgy, thought provoking film instead of one which just leaves you utterly confused and wondering what dolphins have to do with anything, I would suggest Donnie Darko."
4,Serious Food,"Well researched and well written. The chapter on apples, however, was regional in scope, and would not be relevant in the Pacific Northwest, where we have mostly other varieties."
1,this movie was doomed from the start,"If you survive this movie then you will be ok. A creature from mars lands on earth, making the title of the movie pivitol to the story but it's a bad monster movie with the special effects of the monster being ridiculous and mindnumbingly awful. Patrick Muldoon (Starship Troopers, The Arrival II) and Theresa Russell (Black Widow) join forces to try to stop the creature before it inhabits the town and everywhere else. There's always gotta be some guy not beliving the possibility of such creatures until he sees it in his jail room. Man, if they do make a sequel then jesus crist I will strangle myself. A pile of goo on the walls of society."
4,It's Sarah,If you have seen anything by Sarah and you have liked it you will like this. It's not everyone's bag. If you like American Idol and mainstream garbage you won't like it and you will be offended. If you are open minded you will get a kick.
3,"Amazing Story, Mediocre Book","It really shouldn't have taken me as long as it did to get through this book. Dorothy ""Billy"" Tipton's life was fascinating, bold, joyous, sad and unusual. Her life as a talented male jazz musician, at a time when it was challenging for women to get gigs as serious jazz musicians is well chronicled in this book. But despite all the facts, occasional speculation, and details of Billy Tiptons life, this was a very dry read and at times a chore.Yes, I was fully engaged in the STORY because on it's own it is quite powerful and intriguing. It was expertly researched, but Ms. Middlebrook's prose leaves something to be desired. Read this book to learn how this woman spent most of her life as a man, and had wives, lovers and children (adopted), many who didn't know she was a man. However, if you are looking for exciting reading, this book will leave you dissapointed."
4,"not great literature, but a fascinating story","Middlebrook's biography has a fascinating subject but a dearth of material, all the better to provoke speculation. Tipton's deception was astonishing, and her success as a man prompts all sorts of questions about the nature and construction of gender. Her decision to continue the charade until her death, and her wilfully obscure life, is a real mystery. What's not so great is Middlebrook's pedestrian turn of phrase, and her constant speculation keeps reminding one of her lean resources; the biog may have been better if cut by about a third. It's a genuinely moving story, though, and when I reached the book's end I burst into tears."
2,"Meticulously researched, dry and unimaginative presentation","It suprised me that such a fasinating subject could become a difficult to enjoy and ultimately unsatisfying read. The author's avoidance of focussing on Tipton's homosexuality and seeing her life as a pragmatic decision due to her love of jazz and the constraits of her era are a major weakness in this book. It was not a ""hard to put down"" but a ""can't get through it"" read."
2,Billy Tipton Remains a Mystery,"I was shocked to find out that the author has received awards for her previous biographies. I think this book is poorly written. I don't think there was enough material to write a book here. The author is thorough in listing Billy's ""gigs"" but cannot come up with anything concrete about her personal life. This is not actually the author's fault; however, while researching the topic, she should have realized there was not enough information to write an entire book. So what she does is ask question after question about Billy and even writes passages the way things might have been (but we'll never know, she says). If one has to guess and piece together the way things may have been, why even bother with the subject? One can get more mileage out of a subject like this through fiction (such as ""M Butterfly"" or some of Shakespeare's plays)."
4,"Good information, incorrect analysis","I couldn't tell if the author was ignorant of transgenders, or just prejudiced against the idea of anyone being transgender. While one might cross dress to be able to enter a profession reserved for only one gender, one doesn't live their entire life as the opposite gender just for that reason. All of what we know of Billy Tipton points to him being transgender, and to give equal weight to other theories (lesbian, cross dresser for his job) shows an ignorance of transgenderism.Having said that, I enjoyed the book for all its information - including all the information about Billy's friends and family, and about the jazz and swing era that he was a part of. If only the author had left the analysis to someone who knew what they were talking about!"
3,Not a soft frisbee..,"The packaging lies saying that this frisbee is the safest and softest. However, This is a hard plastic frisbee and am not sure how safe it is for dogs teeth. I give this product 3 stars. My Jack-Chi does like this frisbee and it is a great size for smaller dogs."
4,Historic Old Film,"I saw both of these films on television a while back and enjoyed them. I agree with the other person who reviewed this DVD that the sound is flat and the contrast is off in a few areas. One thing Mr. something-ham doesn't realize or forgot to mention is that the film is of the B-western genre from the 1940's. These films were made that poorly from the day they were written. They were more like television episodes than movies. The entire genre was a very historical moment in motion picture history. I can't remember the last time I watched the Honeymooners and experienced a sense of ""depth"" in the acoustics. I am grateful that there is someone who cares enough to distribute this historical content on a new medium for people who understand and appreciate motion pictures. Thank you, I will be looking for more titles to be released from this studio."
1,A Waste of Money,"I have this last day received a DVD copy of these two films and my message to anyone considering buying is, 'keep your money in your pocket'. Not only are the films themselves poor entertainment value but the transfer onto DVD is dismal... BR>For one thing the contrast is poor especially in the darkened scenes and the sound tranfer although high enough in volume is badly badly dubbed in. This has slightly alterd the tone of the actors voices and also makes the sound seem totally flat, with no appearance of distance or the actors position on the screen.I've certanly learned my lesson about buying cheap DVDs, if they are cheap in price they are cheap in quality and not worth buying.Although I do have to admit that I do have some budget DVDs which are acceptable, I suppose it's all to do with which company produces the goods.... I have given this DVD one star, only because I have no choice if I want to air my views"
3,"""Gas,Air & Spring Guns of the World"" by W.H.Smith","This is a somewhat old fashioned,but nevertheless very thorough book,covering every aspect of it's subject,at the time of publication. Many black & white cutaway photos are included,to illustrate the various air pistols and rifles,including the Crosman CO2 Pistols,and the German 'Barakuda' mixed power air rifle,which used an Ether & Compressed Air Mixture,for increased power. To sum up,a book to be reccomended to the Air Gun Historian"
5,One of My Favorite Writers,"Jan Burke tells a great story that's face paced, surprising, and gripping. You won't be able to put it down."
5,The Begining of a Great Career!,"I had the great pleasure of reading an early draft of the book Ms. Lankford wrote subsequent to The Crowning Circle. It is a terrific story that revolves around an astounding and compelling premise (when you hear what it is it will blow your mind). It's certain to be a blockbuster. If you read The Crowning Circle now, you can be among the elite few qualified to claim, ""I knew of her when...""All that said, The Crowning Circle stands on it's own. This novel ends with a bang. It delivers all you'd ask from a thriller and more. Bravo, Jilla! Keep the ink flowing!"
3,A good first try,"This book gets a 3 only because the author needs maturation. It is a very fun book to read. Easy and you don't figure out the mystery early. That is fun. She, on the other hand, goes beyond the realm of reality a few times, especialy when dealing with the death of Randy. I think adhering to reality a bit more would make this a 5. I hope she tries again. I will read her again if she does."
4,"J. R. Lankford has succeeded with her first novel,...","a compelling thriller that combines well-drawn police procedural with technology and thorough characterization. If the Crowning Circle is any indication, she will be successful in her future career, and, like the other reviewers, I would like to see her continue the theme and characters developed in this book.There are some flaws that reduce the book to 4 stars - I found the nature of the villain's obsession a little far-fetched, and was a little disappointed at the transient loyalties of Skeet and Shirley; they gave up on their friends and lovers too easily.Other than those ""wrinkles"", I had a difficult time putting the book down and am especially drawn to Jake, one of the two lead characters. Lankford has mixed elements of thrill writing found in Connelly & Sandford with characters who drive their actions through loyalty and love.A great read! Buy the book! J.R., please keep them coming!"
4,Engrossing,"Other reviewers have summarized the plot; I will just add that I found the story and characters engrossing and hope lankford writes more. Obviously, the book needs a more inviting cover design."
5,"Frightening, Fascinating and downright Fabulous!","This is the best mystery thriller I have read in about two years. After I was contacted by the authoress herself, I couldn't resist picking a copy up. The plot line follows various murder mysteries in a small, non-existant Ohio town, all leading up to a big finish. I swear, I am addicted to this book. The minute I received it, I could not put it down, I carried it to the school cafeteria, the dinner table, I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning just to see how it ended. Of course, I had quite a few nightmares, but they were well worth it. I stil read my favorite parts practically daily. The book shows real promise for its author, the way the chapters flow smoothly, yet incorporate so many different characters. It is a masterpiece, a work of art, literally breathtaking. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, no matter what their taste in literature. It is what I would term an ""Ultimate Thriller"" with lots of surprises along the way."
4,A real page turner,"Because I wrote a bad review of James Patterson's ""Roses are Red"", I received an e-mail from J. R. Lankford asking if I would download three chapters of her novel ""The Crowning Circle"". I did so and was immediately hooked and subsequently purchased her novel. I loved the characters, Jake being my favorite. J. R. Lankford has done her homework especially the technogeeky stuff. At first I felt myself trying to critique the novel because it was a first effort but by the fourth chapter I was totally engrossed. This is a classic edge of your seat page turner. My question is... ""Why does a good novel have to be self-published when seasoned authors are turning out such ...? Keep up the good work Ms. Lankford. I will be waiting for number two!"
5,POWERFUL AND BRILLIANT!,"J. R. Lankford has skillfully created a cast of characters equal to James Patterson's Alex Cross and his sidekick. She has masterfully put together a series of murders and leaves it to Doc Skeet, forensic psychologist to solve the crimes with the help of his buddy, Jake. Unlike Skeet's forensic talents, Jake uses the power of the web and computer technology to help Skeet and together they form a bond so well described by Lankford.Ms. Lankford's skills in formulating love interests for these two men is evident in tastefully incorporating intelligent, educated women for these strong men so entwined in their world of murder and mayhem.I know that after reading ""The Crowning Circle"" the reading population will beg Ms. Lankford for more Skeet and Jake marvelous novels.Bravo Ms. Lankford! Bravo!"
1,Not What I Expected,"The book does cover some good matial in an okay way. However, the book advertises that you can download files, which I did, expecting the book to be somewhat interactive. There is absolutely no way to connect the downloaded files to the book. I sent an email to the author (as he directed/requested in the book) about five months ago asking for informaiton on how to do this and have never received an answer. so I guess,now that they have your money, they really do not care. I will buy n more books in this series or by this author (too bad I already had bought one!)."
2,Dated and Dumb,"Of all Wager's books that I've read, this is by far the worst. The Tunnel, Otto's Boy, and 58 Minutes were exciting reads with good plots and page turning narrative. This book falls far short of those other two with its wafer-thin characters and annoyingly condescending tone. Also, for an action-thriller this book has a lot of space taken up by Wager's political opinions and societal observations of late 1960's America, which is when this book was written.I only recommend this book for die-hard Wager fans. And, yes, that pun was intended."
1,Piece of junk!,"I'm still searching for a good clipper set. Everything I've tried recently turns out to be junk because it's all made in China. This Sunbeam lasted through one and a half haircuts on exceptionally thin hair. I wanted to try it because the Sunbeam that I bought for $15 ten years ago was great and lasted about 8 years, being used about 20 times per year on my husband and son. I recently bought a Wahl that lasted through only a couple haircuts too. I have an old Oster I bought at a garage sale that lasted a couple years because it was not made in China, but it's dying so I need a new clipper set. Has anyone found a clipper set that actually does a good job and will last a lifetime?"
4,Works pretty good when oiled correctly,"I found that the sunbeam sbc864 performed very well when I oiled it right. I gave myself a buzz and (believe me I have very thick hair!) it cut through moderately well. I used another conair buzzer and it just kept getting clogged, but this sunbeam works pretty good!"
2,Relocating to Seattle,"Some good information but the book tries to cover too much and hence, doesn't do anything exceptionally well. Too few communities covered. Too much tourist and moving info covered. I can get restaurant info from better sources and I don't need tips on Pros and Cons of having a roommate. I was hoping to learn more about demographics of surrounding communities but only a few were covered and not in much depth."
3,no info on local taxes,"Maybe this is a nice book about how to move, but not about choosing Seattle. What is the most important thing about picking a house in ""our"" new circumstances? How many bedrooms? Schools? NO. PROPERTY TAXES. Unfunded pension obligations. I live in Illinois and pay 10K in county taxes. I have a vacation house in Michigan and pay 10K in county taxes. I am looking for someone to do the homework on finding a community where they have not pre-spent all my money. This book was no help. The index does not even have a listing for ""taxes""."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I found this book more helpful for the actual packing/moving process than I did for the Seattle-specific location. I like the checklist of things to do before you move and the timeline for when to handle certain moving-related tasks. However, I was not very impressed with the information on Seattle. The descriptions of the neighborhoods seemed romanticized, as if the author were trying to poetically display this extreme personality and contrast to each section. I'm not convinced they are accurate descriptions. I was also expecting a lot of information on the city--downtown, the traffic, the weather, etc.--and I was quite disappointed.I would recommend looking into another book, or buying this one used for 46 cents as I did."
5,Just as promised,Book sent on time and in the condition promised. Very Happy with my purchase. Would order again from this source.
3,plane liaisons,"woods writes no frills, plot driven thrillers, as suspenful as well crafted t.v. movies. in a twist on the tradition of making movie adaptations of best selling books, the is a book based on the plot of a movie classic,hitchcock's strangers on a train.above average, cinematically slick entertainment."
4,A Real Page-Turner,"I enjoyed this Stuat Woods book on Kindle and found it hard to put down. The characters were well-developed, and there were plenty of twists, turns and surprises in the plot. My only criticism is that I found the the ending to be a little weak - almost as if Woods had written enough and needed to end it quickly. Even then, the ending was satisfying enough, and I'm glad I read it."
4,Gotta love Stuart Woods!!!!,"Stuart Woods always gives a quick read, filled with action. This book is no different. Within the first two chapters, the plot of the book is layed out. Sandy Kingsolving and Peter Martindale meet on an airplane. Ironically, they are both having difficulties with their wives, and plot to kill each others wife! They meet and work out the details, but Kingsolving has seconds thoughts and calls the entire thing off. His wife still ends up dead, and Martindale tries to blackmail him.Will Kingsolving finish through with the plan and kill Martindale's wife next? Or will be go to the police and hope they believe him? Won't you be surprised when you find out just who Sandy is really supposed to kill..."
3,Imperfect Stangers,"I am a Woods fan, and enjoyed this book enough to finish it, but I thought there was too much sex talk, which requires no talent, and it was about 50 pages too long. I have read about 6 of his books and this is the first one I was ready for the story to wrap up. But, the characters were diverse, the story original and the Lady Villian was a REAL terror. I still wonder if she Loved Anybody."
2,Well below par!,"Apparently you folks havent read Stuart Woods early novels. Try Chiefs, Grassroots, White Cargo, Palindrome or Heat. He's definately not writing the kind of book he used to! Dead Eyes was good but Imperfect Strangers, Choke and Dirt dont quite live up to my expectations of a novel by such a super writer"
4,Being Dead is No Excuse,"This book is hilarious! I am an Episcopalian and I loved the references to the Episcopal church, albeit their being exaggerated. I liked the recipes very much, too. I have passed this book along to a friend and others are waiting to read it too."
2,"Buy for the humor, but NOT for the recipes!","A fairly enjoyable read, particularly if you are from the south or now live in the south.However, the recipes just do not work. Tried 3 different recipes. No substitutions and they were very simple. The dishes either did not taste good or they didn't come together correctly.I guess I should have expected this, given the title and format of the book. However, many of these recipes are favorites from my past and I would have enjoyed a good resource."
3,If you like cookbooks...,Started off funny and was loving it..then it became pretty mundane and nothing but recipes. Some look pretty good and worth a try. But I don't think this one is as funny as it could have been with less recipes and more funny stories.
5,Being Dead Is No Excuse: The Official Southern Ladies Guide to Hosting the Perfect Funeral,This is a great book that offers lots of humorous stories and delicious Southern food.
5,Makes reading a cookbook fun!,"There's a story behind every recipe, and this is hilarious book! My mother frowned upon the title, but couldn't put the book down. I'm buying several for Christmas presents."
5,Southern Funerals Are Fun,"This book perfectly describes the typical funeral as done in the South. For a serious subject, it leaves the reader chuckling."
1,Good laugh,"A light read, Southern women will enjoy and laugh out loud. The tyoe of book you will hear things your mother told you and her friends talked about in church and bridge club"
1,BEING DEAD IS NO EXCUSE,"A charming book. Every time I buy a copy I find myself giving it away to someone who hasn't read it. The recipes are fantastic, and the whole book most entertaining."
5,Humerous depiction to Southern Mourning in Southern Society,"I absolutely love this book. It is humerous and provides many old receipes from years past. It depicts how true southerners deal with funerals and the death experience. And yes, we, as true southerners, do ""put on the spread"" at a loved one's funeral/wake."
3,Funny at times but also a bit trite,"This book was fun to read in that it did a realistic comparison between the habits of bringing food to funerals in the south in that those of us who are from the south have actually eaten many of the foods described in the book. It is really part cookbook and part fun read, however, as much of the book is taken up with the recipes. After reading it, I passed it on to a friend who is from Nashville and who enjoys the southern culture and cooking. Enjoy it for a light read and a few laughs but know that it contains more recipes than anything else."
5,Plenty of social and cultural insights throughout,"Southern life and death receive close inspection and a healthy dose of humor in Being Dead Is No Excuse; The Official Southern Ladies Guide To Hosting The Perfect Funeral.. Traditional Southern recipes for casseroles, relishes, and 'funeral and wake food' dish up a healthy (or unhealthy, at times) dose of authentic Southern cooking and observation mixed with a pinch of humor. Plenty of social and cultural insights throughout."
5,Being Dead Is No Excuse,I did not know what to expect but I laughed all through the book. The recipes look promising although I have not had the opportunity to try one. I have given this book as a gift and recommended it to several friends. You might find it more relevent if you are from the South and are Episcopalian.
5,Laughter,"I laughed out loud reading this book, and I could relate to some of the dynamics having worked in a church kitchen. Even a Yankee can enjoy this concoction of recipes and humor. It reminded me of my charming friend in Louisiana whose southern conversation flows from her mouth like cream. This book makes a great gift for ladies!"
5,Hilarious Book for Any Southern Belle!,"I couldn't stop reading Metcalf's humorous and accurate descriptions of southern traditions... As soon as I finished my copy I purchased copies for all my fellow ""belles"" to read and all have been delighted with the hysterical accounts of southern funeral protocal as well as the delicious recipes! Also check out Metcalf's wedding version ""If Lilli Beth Don't Catch That Bouquet Somebody's Gonna Die""- equally as funny and a great gift for any mother-of-the-bride!"
5,Being Dead Is No Excuse!,"This book is charming, funny, and helpful. My 80 something neighbor lady wanted me to get it for her so I ordered one for myself too. The delivery time was reasonable and both books are in very good condition."
1,It's Your funeral,"The book is extremely funny but don't try the recipes.I just did the Southern Sideboard Rich Bourbon Dessert.I tried it for a Christmas party. I did everything the recipe said &, yes, I know how to cook.The ingredients cost upwards to $100 and I am left with a sticky, gooey mess.Not to mention that the party is tomorrow and it is 9 p.m.A pox on southern cooking!It is now the next morning and I have the world'slargest Clark Bar on the top of my refrigerator shelf. Dave and I tried to break it with a spoon (didn't work)and I suggested one of those balls they pound against buildings to knock them down. We finally got enough for each guest who tasted it & gave it back to me saying that it was wonderful and I said, Oh, you're just being Southern. It ruined my party!From Dave's wife"
1,Nostalgia for plantation life?!!!,"Apparently I am the only reader who found parts of this book DEEPLY offensive. The author practically swoons over those fabulously fortunate [white] folks who owned plantations. I think we all know who provided the labor force on said plantations. Thus nostalgia for slavery is pretty much undisguised. I quit reading and returned the book to the library at this point. I'm white, but I hate to think what an African-American would experience reading portions of this ""humor"" book. I'd give it zero stars or, if it were possible, negative stars."
4,Enjoyed!,"Being a Northern Lady I may have missed some of the nuances of what the author conveyed, but I certainly found it to be great reading with a wonderful and charming sense of humor. I like'ta die reading some of the stories.I was inspired to get off my bum and make homemade mayonnaises recipe, which turned out wonderful.The recipes all looked very good and easy. I would recommend getting this for your collection and to have one with this title, well it don't get any better then that!The last part of the book gives you some ""Emily Post"" ideas for funerals........the do's and don'ts. Of course they may not work up North, but I wouldn't be afraid to try some of'em.I recommend this book."
4,So True!!,I grew up in Greenville and this book is so very true. It's a wonder to read and a great little gift.
5,A book to be savored,"I found this book to be a treat to read. It was simple yet thought provoking and it was fun to read. The illustrations were cool too and helped to keep the book fun. I took my time reading the book because it had so much delightful information that can be so easily understood that it could be easily and quickly skipped over and missed. Sometimes we need reminders and a new way of looking at life and success and how it is supposed to be fun and flow. This book reminded me of that and gave me some new ideas. As I read this book it calmed me down, reminding me that success comes naturally as a result of keeping ourselves happy and simplifying life's tasks. It is a must have to any book collection. Plus I was happy to see that the author personally signed my copy- Thank You Mr. Gratzon."
4,Good book,This book is an interesting book as well as a fun read. He has some unusual ideas that you may find useful in your own life.
3,chuck videos,I really like the videos the were the best my collection should be completed as of now. thank you.I liked it.
4,very intense and disturbing (this is a good thing!!),"this video is a blend of studio videos, artistic movie footage, and interviews. the videos are from the coma of souls album. the footage is very surreal and exciting. lots of blood-very creepy. the interviews were ok the first time, but get on the nerves after a few views. the live song was unfortunately from a day show-not the usual atmosphere for a band like kreator-but they sound good, so don't let this stop you. the only thing that prevents this from getting 5 stars is the fact that they didn't include any of their older songs, live or video. there are 6 videos plus 1 live song(again ALL from coma of souls album)"
5,Microsoft Office Hit,"I have purchased a ""Que"" book for every version of Microsoft Office that I have had. These books are wonderful. They are a helpful resource and the information you need is easy to find. I recommend this book to anyone who has PowerPoint 2007."
4,Cannot be anymore of a BEGINNER than me!,"This is my very first time to work with PowerPoint let alone 2007. The book is filled with Tips,Notes, and descriptions of all the tabs in 2007. However, I would like to have more detailed ""How To"" on the many creative things that you can do. The book will tell you where to go if you are looking for something in particular which makes it a good reference book. But I would like more detail more depth with all the creative word art and effects, and much more that 2007 has available. Overall it is a pretty good book for introducing the many amazing features of the 2007. And I agree that the CD that comes with it is somewhat worthless in my opinion. The book does point out that you do not have to be creative to make and awesome Presentation with 2007. It does everything for you."
5,Better then the headliner,"I went to see mest and H2o the other day at the gracelands and these guys got the kids dancing more than h2o or mest. I love Cease and desist and have yet to ehar the other one. But the CD i have heard was phenominal, to bad it is only 7 songs :(. But i love the unqiue musical style... the only band out there with one of them since sublime!keep it rock\m/ >.< \m/"
1,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"Lame! So sad to report, but this band, despite thier talent...has lost my interrest. This is a simple rock record that brings a little hyped up DVD to help make you hate the album even more than when you listened to it. Yeah, they still look coool, but they sound like a band who is despearte to appeal to a radio friendly generation. It's not going to happen. Even cashing in on the anti-Bush card, as much as I relate to that, it's a worthless effort. It sucks. I could care less what Godhead does next. They are used-to-be's who became never-will-be-again's. The only goood album that this band has ever released is '2000 Years Of Human Error'."
5,Godhead in their finest hour.,"I is without a doubt GODHEAD at their best. I first got into Godhead at the end of 2000 when I saw them open for Marilyn Manson. So when ""2000 Year of Human Error"" was released I picked it up and fell in love with it. Their next album was ""Evolver"", which was a step down in my opinion. Just when I was thinking that Godhead would never put out another great alblum they released ""The Shadow Line"". The best way I can describe this album is a cross between""2000 Year of Human Error"" and an Orgy album. Its a little less goth then their debut, but also better. I won't get into all of the songs but every track is great except for maybe track 5 (Push) and track 11 (Your End Of Days). Just buy it and see for yourself how good this record is."
1,Rubbish,"I've been a huge fan of gODHEAD since I first heard them...I bought Power Tool Stigmata and 2000 Years of Human Error and loved them...Evolver was pretty whiney but at least you could rock out to some of the songs....this is just pure emo rubbish. I know their songs have never exactly been positive, but at least they had that good old-fashioned metal energy...this is just whine whine whine...I'm ashamed I ever bought this album, I actually have it tucked away in a drawer so nobody can see it. I used to love these guys...hung out with them at a concert, etc, but their music is quickly turning into whiney emo crap and I, for one, am not buying another one of their albums unless they stop boohoo'ing and start rocking again. Not trying to downplay anybody else's taste, but I don't want somebody else making the same mistake I did, thinking it was going to be energetic metal when it's more ""I am a sea of sorrow."""
2,Well-Intentioned but Uninspired,"This recording of Mahler's 8th Symphony does not stand among the best of what is available in the current recorded versions. The orchestra and chorus sounds very distant and shallow. The Atlanta Orchestra has made an admirable attempt to record this piece. Unfortunately, the competition is overwhelming among other recorded Mahler 8ths. For the outlay required for one CD, one would be far better served to purchase the historic 1972 recording of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (recorded in Vienna) on London/Decca. Even the 1960s recording of the 8th with Bernstein and thd London Symphony Orchestra, while not a first choice, is far preferable to this recording.A final detail that I do not like about this recording: the organ music comes through speakers, not an authentic pipe organ."
5,Angels decending from heaven,"My usual commute wouldn't allow anything more than the first movement. Thanks to the accident/construction, one day my commute took unusally longer which allowed me to sit tight in my car and listen the entire CD. When it was over, I was in tears because it was so beautiful and inspriational. I am fairly new to Mahler and I don't have any bias or expectation on how this symphony should be played. But I know good music when I can hear it and I absolutely love this album. Not only it sounded killer (I have a high end car stereo) and the performance was spectacular, especially the choral part at the last movement was out of this world. I almost saw Angels decending from the Heaven.As a life long Wagnerian, I am very familiar with Solti so I purchased his 1972 CSO recording. Solti was usual himself in that album. However, everytime I want to listen to M8, Shaw/ASO M8 is the one I play. Since then I got M2 by Levi/ASO, which was also a killer. I highly recommend that too."
4,what really happened in 1680,"Her husband still possessed by a mysterious spirit, Catherine Harridge Collins is comforted by Bramwell Collins, who forces Catherine to admit that she still loves him. Daphne, Bramwell's wife and Catherine's sister, becomes suicidal at the thought of losing Bramwell.Quentin Collins saves Julia Collins from the increasingly disturbed James Forsythe. Before being vanquished by the spirit of Brutus Collins, Forsythe reveals the truth about the events of 1680.The last episode on this tape features the 1680 flashback with Louis Edmonds as the obnoxious Brutus. It will probably just confirm what you have already guessed about the curse, but it was nice to see all the facts in evidence."
4,Entering The Twilight Zone,"The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because of the first chapter. I am so tired of everyone claiming to be insane, when they find themselves in an unbelievable position.Zain and Lacey are great characters, and the book is great. I just can't believe anyone would think they were dreaming, or insane when they can feel and see everything around them.Get past the first chapter and you are in for a great read. I loved Reene, an amazing AI, and Pio, an amazing alien, not to mention Bobzilla.There is enough excitement for everyone. Not to mention they get to save the world.A wonderful romance is included, and Lacey is not dumb, she is very smart and with her help Zain is able to foil his worst enemy and clear his name of murder.This is a smart, fun, read. Don't miss it."
2,Slow Start,"This was my first experience with CJ Barry. This book was beyond formulaic in its rendering and could not be saved by what little chemistry there was (after more than half the book) between the luckily-DNA-capatible aliens. If there is anything worth repeating by purchasing the other two books in this series I could not find it.In addition to being predictable Barry's world is confusing; with descriptions of machinery and technology which are certainly uninteresting and only distracting. While the female characters are spunky the male lead is uninteresting and uncharismatic. While I understand that most of us reading romantic fiction are in it for the relationships and the happy endings (dare I say: the SEX?), CJ Barry has given it to us; there is nothing to distinguish this novel from any other girl meets boy paper weight.The only reason it got two stars is because of the Bobzillas."
2,7 good stories out of 30,"I really liked Baxter's ""In the Un-Black"", Moorcock's ""A Slow Saturday Night at the Surrealist Sporting Club"" and Wells's ""'Bassador"", and liked the stories by Whitton, Kelly, Rucker+Shirley and Niven. But 7 stories out of 30 is not a good yield."
4,great album,great album to the previous reviews i cannot add anything that makes sense. I just like this music very much.
1,200+ pages of rehashed trash,"In portraying herself to be the victim of numerous betrayals by O.J Simpson, rather than evoke sympathy and understanding from her readers, the author merely succeeds in proving herself to be weak, materialistic, and as morally bereft as her lover. Given the amount of money made from the sale of this book, it is impossible to conjure up any sympathy for how this relationship ""cost her everything."" Because of her willing involvement in the events following the murders, I found her many references to faith, spirituality, and strong religious beliefs to be hollow and meaningless. Fortunately, her readers will not be as blind or easily misled as the jurors who acquitted O.J."
1,What a shame...,"I was hoping for some important insight from a person with intimate knowledge of a murderer, but instead all I got was ""oh, poor me"". The title of the book should be ""I'm an idiot so give me sympathy""! Why do women put themselves through hell when everyone around them can clearly see their destructive actions?This book was an attempt by Paula to get some cash from being Oj's play thing, what a shame."
2,FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF,"This book was not really informative at all. I found it to be very much like she was feeling very sorry for herself, and not for what happened to Nicole, Ron, and the family's especially the children. It is a good thing that she got psych help, cause she needed it."
5,Great bargain,I cannot believe how well this TV puts out a picture. Colors are vivid and true. HDTV is absolutely spectacular and it comes with many different ways to hook up to existing cable boxes. Overall I am more than satisfied with it.
4,"Memorable, quoteable, and historical","Harvey Fierstien plays an aging drag queen looking for love, companionship, and understanding from the people in his life. The movie makes a great transition from the theater to film. It is a classic that contains some of the most powerful dialoge that I have seen. The performances by Anne Bancroft are moving. Every scene where Arnold (Harvey Fierstein) confronts his mother (Anne Bancroft) will leave you quoting lines with your friends for years."
5,"Hey, pass the kleenex and remember who ya first watched with","This is an excellent movie to own to revisit formulative times in your life. Watching your own copy makes you remember who you first saw it with, who you had your first crush with, who you had your first heartache with, all while being hilarious, quoteable, and nostalgic at the same time. WARNING: DON'T watch while depressed... this one will have you grabbing up Kleenex and cuddling the pets!"
5,My favortie all time movie,"This was my favorite movie of all time. I am a 51 year old mother and grandmother, am not gay, but love to be in the presence of truly gay men. I have one who is my very best friend, and I wish I could find more. But this little town I live in is SICK when it comes to that.I have been searching EVERYWHERE for this movie. The copy I had got eaten up by my old VCR. This is the first time I have come close to locating another copy. You can't by it thur the usual means. Anne Bancroft as Harvey's mother makes this movie. But no one can out do Harvey. He is so unique and funny and I just love everything I've seen him in. Which I must say, is NOT ENOUGH!!! Of course Matthew Broderick is great also, but my hat still goes off to Harvey!!!! THE GREATEST OF ALL TIMES!!"
4,Love it!,"I have played this for multiple people, some of which have recorded their own CD's and they all love it as well. Very soulfull."
5,A nice listen,Very enjoyable - discovered this music thanks to Pandora and have gotten lots of enjoyable hours from listening to this CD.
5,Excellent history book.,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It is an excellent book on the NYFD and its history.
5,Bravo Badges of the Bravest,"Not knowing exactly what to expect and not knowing if this would be a dry and boring read,we are very happy to say it is an interesting and informative read. The background knowledge and interest that the writer has shown is a very good part of the book. He is a very interesting writer and the information in his book is well presented and keeps the readers interest by his writing style.We were amazed at how many badges there are and what a wide variety of reasons for them.I would say this book is great for any one interested in the fire department, and it's history, of New York."
2,One of the best Chopin CDs out there,"I first heard the first six tracks on a Telarc LP(remember those?), and was transfixed. When the CD came out and had the B-minor sonata added it got even better. The tonal quality of the piano has no peer and the performance by Mr. Frager is touching. A treasure for any Chopin enthusiast."
4,Easy way to jump to a higher level of Italian comprehension.,"If you have a basic understanding of Italian and are ready to go on to another level, I highly recommend this tape program. After listening to Berlitz and Baron's Beginning Italian cassettes, I was getting tired of repeating ""Dove la pharmacia"" but wasn't sure where to go from there. These tapes are set up in a story format. You listen to the chapters in your car without having to set aside actual ""learning"" time. Very quickly I found myself adding extensively to my vocabulary and I've even started to use tenses other than first person present tense. This is a very stress-less way to gain a better understanding of the Italian language."
1,The worst book I've read in my life.,"I have read many bad books, but this is the first of Jane Jeffry's that's been put into my hands. And it is a great example of writing so poor and predictable that each paragraph is a cringer.The main character is an adult version of the smart-aleck child and her friends are of her type. They spend their time sniping at the cartoons who pose as secondary charcters or bitng back some smart-aleck remark that the reader has to read. There's also plenty of warm-hearted gush such as women weaned on women's magazines like.Most silly of all is that the main character runs into person after person who want nothing more that to discuss in detail with strangers everything that they know about everyone involved.Her readers must be semi-literates, overworked to the point at which they don't want anything but pablum.Jane Jeffry - criminal tree murderer."
4,Nice Easy Read,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Churchill and the Jane Jeffry series, and while I enjoyed this book, I definitely didn't feel it was one of her best.I think what threw it off for me was the whole premise of Jane being asked by a total stranger to plan their wedding, and her agreeing to it. It would've made more sense to me if Shelley had been the one planning the wedding, since she's always been presented as the ""take-charge"" part of the team in all the previous books, and Jane had gone along to assist her. The whole thing being set up as it was just seemed odd to me, and not at all in character for the Jane and Shelley I've come to know through reading this series.All in all, I still recommend this series highly. This latest installment wasn't bad...it just wasn't up to the par I'm used to with Ms. Churchill."
1,"TOTAL CHINA KNOCK OFF, NOT ORIGINAL SALUX WASH CLOTH FROM JAPAN!! BUYERS BEWARE!!!","So before I begin my review, let me first start by saying this review is for the seller and their knock off china wash cloth. THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE ORIGINAL SALUX WASH CLOTH FROM JAPAN!Received my package today but to my surprise I received a ""knock off"" wash cloth that IS NOT Salux and IS NOT from Japan but is indeed from China. I was extremely disappointed! Had the actual wash cloth that I received been the same thick material that the Salux one is then I definitely wouldn't have had a problem sticking with it. This one is made of a cheap material that feels very thin. Contacted Amazon immediately and am shipping it back for full refund. I should have read the other reviews before ordering so that is my bad. Soooo disappointed!! ):BUYERS BEWARE - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE CHINA KNOCK OFFS!!!"
5,classic for a reason,"I grew up with this same brand, same packaging, same product. It's a surprise that it took so long to catch on in the West. These are all over Japan. This particular brand is admittedly slightly more stiff than some other brands, but it is largely a matter of preference. I personally prefer this brand, as softer brands just don't feel like it's doing the same job.Lasts a long time, and softens a little with use. So versatile!I am delighted to find such a large color selection online for a reasonable price! Wonderful!"
4,A Clean Feeling from a Salux,My doctor recommended that I try a Salux for a really clean back. He said he has been using one for years. He has always given me good advice and this is up there with the best of it. The Salux leaves me with a back clean of any dried skin and with a gentle scrubbed feel.
2,Salux Japanese towels,"Salux Japanese towels stay away from this company !! They broke up my orderinto several pieces and charged me more for the shipping than the product cost! I was not in a hurry and it took over 3 weeks for all to arrive and they charged me more than $30.00 in fees and they came crammed in boxes that were in ill repair! This company practices bad business ,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!"
1,Not Salux,"I also got the China knock off product, picture of the girl even looks similar. This is not a Salux! Shame on them for false advertising :("
2,Not a SALUX,"I ordered a ""Salux"" washcloth which is a Japanese product and did not receive that. Instead, received a Chinese made ""Leyijie."" I have not used this Chinese product yet and will not return it (as we opened the package when it arrived to compare the quality to a real Salux washcloth.) Granted, these washcloths soften with repeated use, but this Leyijie feels very scratchy and the weave does not seem as consistent as the Salux. We will try it but will not order this product again as it is not the brand that was advertised. Salux is the gold standard and visibly, this Leyijie product is not up to par. I am disappointed that we did not receive what was advertised and ordered."
1,Did not receive product described,"Ordered a Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel- Aquamarine Green (Sold by: SCS Collectibles, Inc).Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel- Aquamarine GreenDid not really pay close attention until after I opened it, and noticed that it was not made by Salux, but rather made by Leyijie, a Chinese company, making a similar, but not identical product. The authentic one is made in Japan. The one I received was made in China. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to know if you will get the authentic one, or a substitute. Will return the product and re-order. Fingers crossed that I get a real one next time."
1,This Leyjie washcloth is rough!,"This Leyjie brand Chinese washcloth is green, just like the description says. It probably exfoliates just like the description says, too, but I'm not going to try it because I value my epidermis too much. It is shiny and thin and very, very rough. It does appear to be the same dimensions as claimed in the description."
2,"It would be great, IF it sayed together!","This toy is really cute. My daughter (5) got it as a gift and loved it from first sight. She and I played with it for half an hour together, and only the ""lock"" pulled off, so I wasn't worried. I folded it up, put the lock back in place and we thought it was great. The next morning, she woke up and took it out ot play with it on her own. She managed to open it by herself, set it up to play, and then everything went wrong. The swing broke 5 or six times over the course of an hour, and the parts are tiny. Then after she was finished playing, she tried to fold the castle up and as she did, and I watched, the floor in one room broke off and the pillars in the other came apart. She is so dissapointed. She really liked the concept of this toy, but it's VERY poorly constructed. Save your money...it's just not worth it! :("
2,"Great Concept, Cheaply Made","This toy is way too expensive for the cheap production of it! I love the idea behind it though. It folds up so your child can take it anywhere. The problem is that it never folds up very well and can break very easily if not folded exactly right. Also the swing never attached very well and when I finally got it to work, Sleeping Beauty never would actually sit. She slid right off. I guess this bothered me more thn my 5 and 2 year olds. They enjoyed it for a while. The plastic furniture gets lost, but that is not unusual for these type of toys. Unfortunately, I just ended up throwing this toy away. What a waste!! Again, this toy is way too expensive for what it is. Disney should start making better quality toys for our children."
2,Expected Better Quality From Disney,"My 3-year-old daughter wanted this product so badly for Christmas. It was expensive but Santa delivered. I am thoroughly disappointed with it and I hope Santa reassigned the elves responsible for construction of this toy! It so cheaply made and never folds up properly...staircases and pillars bend, the swing has never worked (it fell off when we opened it for the first time) and the floor keeps popping up once it's opened. She still plays with it but gets frustrated that it doesn't ""work"". There is a Little Tikes version of a castle similar to this...I believe it's Cinderella and the figures are short with snap-on clothing. We have that one too and, not only is it better quality, the price is (or was at Christmas) better. I'd take the Little Tikes version over this one any day!"
2,cheaply made,"I agree with several of the other reviewers, it is very cheaply made but my 4 year old doesn't seem to mind she uses it with all of her other polly pocket princesses. The swing is definitely the worst part of it and the furniture doesn't really sit very well on the upper level of the castle. I probably wouldn't have bought it for a Christmas gift if I had read the reviews before. It's not really worth the money!"
4,Perfect for use with small rubber princesses,"We bought this playset after using it at a friend's home. It is perfect for use with small rubber princesses. I especially liked it because it came with furniture that works well for these figures(couch, bed, tables...) We keep it put away when not in use and don't use it with larger groups as it isn't as sturdy as Fisher Price Little people playsets.We have had it for several monthes with no problems."
1,Disney is not setting a good quality track record,"As with other non Mattel Disney toys, this looks better in pictures than actually playing with it. I'm not sure what happened with Disney quality, but nearly every Disney item we own breaks easily and is of poor quality.Like other reviewers, we had the same issues with the clip that holds it together just falling off. There are a LOT of little pices, great for choking on, stepping on, or simply losing. The swing breaks easily and is a real pain to get back together. The prince's cloak never stays on. The pillar doesn't stay up and the pieces don't fold correctly...I could go on."
3,"Too expensive, but my daughter loves it","My daughter fell in love with his item when she saw the commercial on TV, and it became the top item on her Christmas Wish List. I think it's too expensive for what it is, but she has really enjoyed playing with it. The case is cheap plastic, and pieces pop off easily. Otherwise, it is just the right size for her Polly Pocket princess dolls, and if you have a chold who is into Princesses, she will enjoy this item and ideally you'll get your money's worth."
5,Excellent!!,"I hear everyday this CD,Marisela have a sweet voice and very emotional in every song .I can`t wait for other New album Marisela!!.Please don`t disappoint this album."
4,One of those memories...,"I didn't even know the title of this movie at first. I'm quite sure I wasn't any older than six when I saw it. But it's one of those things that just stuck in my head, and I found out what it was called by mounting a Google search for what little bits of the plot I could recall. Apparently the Japanese title is Tottoi. I later became a huge fan of Ghibli movies. I seem to have vaguely pleasant memories of this one, so maybe I'll find a copy sometime. Maybe. The cover art does not seem to reflect the actual visuals of the movie, by the way; the American distributors apparently felt a need to fit into the contemporary (post Care Bears?) style of American children's animation."
5,Buy this before you go to Keys: Nice quick guide to Florida Keys,"It is possible to speed along a highway, to see nothing of the flowering trees along the way, the gleam of sunlight on the incredibly blue water, or the points of interest where history was made. But this should never happen on U.S. 1 in the Florida Keys.Memo to drivers: slow down a bit, have someone read to you from this booklet, and enjoy the Keys as you travel through them."
1,no much here,"If you, like me, are interested in the movie because of its R rating and the description of its content, the you will be sadly disappointed. There is very little nudity and at least half of the movie is the boyfrind running all over the place looking for his girfriend. There is no dominance and submission angle to this movie. Other than the ocassional partial female nudity, this movie could probably be rated PG."
1,Unbeliabley brutally bad movie-If ou get a chance to seeit DON'T.,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN PERHAPS IN MY LIFETIME. HOW THEY COULD TURN OUT SUCH S___BOGGLES MY MIND. MY FAULT I BOUGHT IT THINKING IT WAS SOMETHING THAT IT WAS NOT.
5,TOURIST'S NIGHTMARE,"THIS MOVIE SHOWS THE DANGER OF TRUSTING STRANGER THAT MAY NOT HAVE YOUR BEST INTEREST.THE MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH. IT'S A DARK JOURNEY FOR A COUPLE WHO'S DREAM OF BEING TOGETHER ARE SHATTER BY AN UNFORGIVABLE ACT. THE ADUCTION OF A FIANCEE TO BE GIVEN TO WHITE SLAVERY, PUSHES THE BOYFRIEND TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO GET HER BACK.THE EMOTIONAL OBSTACLE THAT THE COUPLE ENCOUNTER MAY BE TOO HUGE TO OVERCOME."
5,"You know, a real danger in writing reviews late at night...","...is that you give a CD a 5-star rating, praise it to the heavens, and then say you recommend it WITH reservation...where you meant to say you recommend it WITHOUT reservation.Or enough sleep."
1,"Great Program, Unacceptable Sound Quality","I've been a Miltie fan for decades and my wife just bought this DVD (together with Volume 2) for me for Xmas. The show is fine, albeit dated, and deserves 4 stars if one disregarded the audio quality which is incredibly poor and certainly below even 1950s standards. But how on earth can you disregard the fact that the music and the dialogs and the jokes (which is WHY you'd buy this DVD !) are garbled and at parts unintelligible; there are scenes one simply cannot make out what is being said or sung.I am in the process of complaining to Amazon, but given their non-return policy concerning ""opened"" DVDs I expect some discussion about how one might learn of unacceptable quality without opening this product. The only ""consumer review"" (if it is not a fake, -- awarding 5 stars !!!) is truly perplexing.My advice: Buy this product only if you feel compelled to burn 23 one-dollar bills, so as to waste both money and time."
3,it's not a bad text,"This is not a bad introduction to mathematical analysis. It provides a clear, concise, and often intuitive discussion of many of the fundamental topic in the field: sequences and series of reals, convergence, subsets, compactness, connectedness, differentiation, integration, the inverse and implicit function theorems and even a brief (not fully satisfactory ) discussion of metric spaces. Certainly it lacks rigour (it even neglects to properly develope the real number field), but it is nonetheless valuable as an introduction to mathematical reasoning. For those seeking more rigorous treatments of the subject at a more reasonable price I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers that Kolmogorov & Fomin's and Haaser & Sullivan's texts are wonderful. David Sprecher's text ""The Elements of Analysis"" is also well worth a look."
4,It's not THAT bad...,"OK, it has a few typos, it is kinda hard to read and not very rigorous at some points, but all in all it's still an useful book for an intro to intermediate level analysis course--and I found it concise and very thorough, especially since it has a couple chapters on one variable analysis."
3,A really easy book to follow,"The ""Advanced Calculus"" is one of the easiest text book on analysis you can find. I agree there are several typos, but the idea is clear & there is no ""mistry"" in this book. It might not be the best in the world, but I personly think that is a great book to get start in the analysis course."
2,"A bad introduction lacking in ""good proofs""","According to my instructor for this course, I would not receive an A (or probably a B) if I wrote my proofs like Fitzpatrick does. The book leaves out many details and is overall very aggrivating. A good introduction to analysis should be composed of detailed, carefully worked out proofs that can suit anyone from an advanced learner to a beginner. This book, however, functions more like an outline, leaving you to fill in blanks that may be impossible to infer."
1,This book blows goats,"Proposition 1: Fitzpatrick is a moron. Proof: Easy. Turn to any page in this book and read it.This has got to be the most expensive analysis book in the world -- yet it's worthless! The $10 Dover books are so much better. Instead of wasting your money on this book, buy Kolmogorov & Fomin's ""Introductory Real Analysis"" or Hasaar and Sulivan's ""Real Analysis""."
2,Dr Scholl's DR5555 Foot and Hand Care Kit,"Just the slightest pressure will cause the thing to turn off - which is a safety feature. It is ok for filing nails, but not for buffing the feet. It does not apply enough pressure to make it worthwhile. It is a great idea, but it fails to be affective. Wait for the improved version of this item!"
1,dr. scholl's foot and hand care kit,"it not good, but you can try the one that Dr. Leonard's has for 7.99 it is very good. It is item #72199."
1,worthless,"Use it after a shower as recommended and it stops dead no matter how lightly you apply it. Use it on dry skin and it skims over the surface without leaving a trace. Pointless, useless, worthless."
2,"By itself, the buffer ain't up to snuff. Get the full kit for a few dollars more.","This Pedicure Foot Care Kit is ideal for people who have slightly calloused soles and heels.The battery-powered exfoliator has three interchangeable discs with different textures. The discs rotate, much like an electric sander. However, because it is powered by only two AA batteries (not included in the kit), too much pressure causes the disc to stop spinning. This may not be a flaw in its design, but actually a safety feature. The unit is very light and fits comfortably in your hand. It is also covered by a one-year warranty."
1,don't buy it!,"I just bought this product today for more than it's being sold for here, and tried it out. don't buy it! I tried each of the attachments and none work at all. just touching my foot (heel) very lightly made the motor stop. No power and totally a lost cause."
1,Not an OEM Stihl part.,"The heads I was shipped by this seller were not the OEM parts described in the description of this product. They are an inferior after market brand. They are NOT Stihl ""25-2 Auto-cut"". The ones I received were ""Proven Cutter 252?"" I am sending them back for a FULL refund. I will follow up as to how that goes. If you want a original Stihl OEM part...don't buy these!"
4,great binoculars for the price,Was using 7 X 25 Bushnells to watch the birds at the bird feeder. treated myself to these 8 X 30 Bushnells and just a world of difference. Wish I had gotten them sooner. Work great with glasses.
4,Decent for the wearer of glasses,"Found in a search for a binocular I could use without removing my glasses. It's still not ideal, but far better than what I've been using. Also bright, moderately compact, and feel good in my hands."
2,"Not as boring as Wheel of Fortune, but still boring.","I really looked forward to this being that golf is my favorite sport, but when I played it, I was so bored out of my mind! I'd pass on this one if I were you, folks."
3,Disappointing; How Miss Pollock pretended to write a book!,"Having followed this story in the newspaper (WSJ & NYT) as it happened, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, the book shed little new information. The book does not even wrap up by telling us what happens to all the players in any depth. It seemed little more than a compilation of the news articles. I was hoping for a lot more."
2,Major Disappointment,"I love books on finance and crime. Unfortunately, this book leaves a lot to be desired. It seems that in the rush to get this book published, the author cut a few corners. For example, in one minute, Frankel is broke and being suspended by the SEC. The next thing you know, he buys an insurance company and starts expanding his empire. It is never fully explained just where Frankel's money actually come from to make these purchases. Much time seems to be spent on Frankel's deviant sexual practices, but there is precious little on exactly where Frankel's money really is. The author should have done here homework!"
4,Very Entertaining Business-oriented True Crime Drama,"This is one of those crazy true-life stories that are stranger than fiction. Mystery and business readers will enjoy this tale of a smart con man who builds an empire based on greed and lies, and how it unravels."
3,Not bad,"Pollock obviously used my earlier version of the Frankel story as template for this book. I broke the Frankel story while working as the police reporter for the small daily newspaper in Greenwich, Conn. On a daily basis, and as the Frankel story unfolded, I saw my reports regurgitated by Pollack's big bad Wall Street Journal, the Times and papers across the country. Though my writing admittedly is not very polished, and I am more of a Columbo-type, just-the-facts kind of reporter, I like to think my version is compelling because it's genuine. It's the work of a small-time police reporter who stumbled onto something huge. My book was published within a year of my breaking the story, so Pollock had much more time to follow the trails I blazed for her."
1,ANNOYING.,"WHAT AN ANNOYING SCREWHEAD. I keep trying to read this book and have given up. Frankel's lying is one thing, but good Lord, his inability to actually consumate a trade (or anything else, evidently) is BEYOND annoying and makes for frustrating reading. At 2 bucks for a used copy, it's overpriced."
5,The Best of the Best,"Can you imagine not one, not two, but three of THEE BEST renditions of three very important organ pieces on one disk?Well, this cd has them. I`m referring to the Maestoso of Saint-Saens` Symphony No. 3, the Toccata of Widor`s Symphony No. 5, and Bach`s Toccata & Fugue Bwv 565.I`ve heard countless versions of the Bach and Saint-Saens, and a few of the Widor. However, nothing has yet surpassed the grandeur and power of Murray`s playing.The rest of the pieces are very commendable as well, especially Soler`s Emperor`s Fanfare and the Franck Grand Piece."
5,Organ Blaster,Great pipe organ favorites wonderfully full with all the stops out and floor shakingly loud exquisitely played though Happy music
2,Definitely Mediocre at Best,"One of the worst performances of the Widor ever -- lost most of the volume about 2 minutes into the piece. While there were somewhat adequate renditions of the Bach and the Saint Saens, it was on balance disappointing. As a fan of E. Power Biggs, Virgil Fox (saw both in person) this CD didn't do the classical pieces justice. A strange mix of music."
2,Mediocre,"After reading the very positive posts here, I purchased this CD and was disappointed. Yes, there was music on there that I liked but also quite a bit that I did not. The quality is uneven. I guess if you bought it, it would be one way to learn what you do and don't like."
4,"A wailing, hands-in-the-air anthem!!!","What an awesome, uplifting song. The first time I heard this tune, I instantly fell in love. And the first time I heard it at a club, it was a circuit explosion: smiles, hands-in-the-air... off the hook! I'm normally not big on bubble-gum anthems, but this is a good one."
4,"I love this cd,I just lay on the floor and let it play","I especially like Mystery, Paper Airplane,Hard, Road Bone is really fantastic, I can't stop listening when Willy is playing, the guitar playing is beautiful"
5,Great purchase for any music lover,Willy Porter is a great singer/songwriter. He should have become a star in today's culture not soon enough. He deserves all the praises he receives. Buy this album and you will see the greatness that comes from the mind of Willy Porter.
5,Soaring...,"Willy Porter's music SOARS! The guy has soul and subtlety. This music will sneak up on you and pull you in. It seems that, for Willy, making music is like falling off a log. He's a natural."
5,Falling Forward,"We recently saw Willy Porter play at the Ben and Jerry's- One World One Heart festival at Sugarbush Resort in Vermont. He was incredible! If you ever have the chance to see him live, do it."
5,Worth the Wait!!,"Are you looking for thought provoking songs? Would you like those thoughts to be accompanied by incredible music? If that is the case, then you should by this CD.Willy Porter has managed to bring three qualities together for this cd: incredible skill, thoughtfullness and enjoyability. I have heard a number of technically amazing musicians that lack the ability to play consistantly enjoyable music. Likewise, the majority of the thought provoking music I have heard lacks on either the musically enjoyable or skill side.Willy has managed to make stunning music that has thoughtfull lyrics, inspiring skill and is simply enjoyable to listen to.......score one more for Willy Porter!"
4,"Nice Old-Fashioned Ghost Story, But Please Do Read The Book","I can add little to the review of the movie that the other people haven't. This is an old-fashioned type ghost story, relying on atmosphere rather than special effects and splattering blood. I did want to mention, though, that if possible the viewer should get a used copy of the book ""The Uninvited"" by Dorothy MacArdle. It's even more eerily atmospheric, with no ""comic relief"" at all, and with some wonderful side characters that unfortunately were left out of the movie. In addition, there is an interesting sub-plot (relevant to the ghost story) about a play that the main character is writing that was dropped from the movie when they decided to make him a composer rather than a theater critic/author. Then, after you read ""The Uninvited"" you might want to pick up a copy of ""The Unforeseen"" by the same author. It's not as good as the former, but will tell you what happened to the main characters from ""The Uninvited"" after the book ended."
2,The Unwanted,"I saw this recommended by a few people reviewing The Haunting(1963), so I thought it might be good. What a disappointment.Except for the girl, the acting is atrocious and overdone, 1930s style. They even have the temerity to show the ghost and give us a logical explanation of events. Bang goes all sense of mystery and intrigue.The more this movie sinks in, the more it becomes obvious that it's a cheap imitation of Rebecca(1940). The coastal setting, the dead hand of the past, the sexual intrigue...the similarities go on. But Rebecca is scary (if a bit slow-starting)whereas this only offers a bit of nice scenery.Gail Russell does a great job as Stella, just exactly what you'd expect from a sensitive girl in such a situation; hence 2 stars.Watch Rebecca to appreciate the difference between acting and hamming. If you really want to be scared, watch The Haunting."
1,"Bad movie, bad acting, bad ending......",It was just bad people and in no way a classic-no wonder I never heard of it.
4,Better Than Average,"I loved the whole ""ghost"" story approach. Muffled crying in the night when no one is there. The mist. The cliff. The ghostly appearances. One would never guess until the end what is going on! The only problem I had was a 40 year old man pursuing a 20 year old girl. Call me old fashioned! But, you won't be dissappointed with this one. Although there are some ""dead"" scenes now and again (pardon the pun), all in all, a keeper."
4,Good who-done-it with ghosts.,"This is a good who-done-it about an old murder, with the added thrill of a doubly haunted house. The acting is good, Gail Russell (Stella) is beautiful, and Ray Milland is suavely appealing. The attractive musical score by Victor Young features his beautiful hit melody ""Stella by Starlight."""
4,Beautifully Scary,"I first experienced ""The Uninvited"" as a high school play. Later, in college, I managed to track it down in the video store and I've been in love with it ever since. The cinematography and Cornish scenary are stunning, and the atmosphere they create is of the scariest kind-seemingly normal, but very, very wrong somehow. This is a film that relies on plot, atmosphere, and *gasp* acting to scare its viewers. If the modern remakes of ""The Haunting"" and ""The House on Haunted Hill"" are your cup of tea, skip this one and leave it for those of us who like our ghost stories old-fashioned and terrifying."
5,Favorite Ghost Story of All Time,"It's that ghostly time of year again, and as always I pull out ""The Uninvited"" to watch at 11 o'clock at night just to get the great chills running up and down my spine.It's been my favorite ghost movie since I was a kid and our old rolling window shade flew up just as the ghost appeared. No slashing, no great Fx, just spine tingling atmosphere! I hope they're planning on getting it on DVD soon."
5,A classic favorite of my whole family,"The Uninvited is one fantastic ghost story! Everyone in my family loves it, ages range from 80 down to 18. Our only wish is to be able to get it on DVD. So far I can't find it anywhere.Ray Milland does a great job, as do the ladies of the film. It's the perfect ghost story, no gore, no flashy shows of light and effects, just a good classic scary film that scares without shocking and making you sick!Give this one a try. It may be black and white, ok, so it's an old movie, which is enough to make some people shy away from it, but don't think that way. This one is worth viewing, and in my opinion, owning and watching over and over again."
5,The Uninvited DVD,"I've loved this movie since I was a little girl. Ghosts and ghost stories have always been my favorite things. I owned a copy of this film on VHS, but until now, I couldn't find it on DVD. Thanks. It is a little-known classic."
2,Nice but Outdated,I liked this book but bought it not knowing it's from 1939. It was interesting to read but not something that would be very helpful today.
1,Warantte service is not existent,"I received my Big Red Garden Tiller all crated up. It was the next weekend that I was able to uncrate it. Sure nuff, one tire was flat and off the rim. I tried airing it up myself but could not get it to take air. Took it off and took it to a tire repair shop. They got it aired up but it only held for 3 days. Tried again and it only held for 2 days. Tried to contact the 4 service centers in my area but they would not help me as they said Troy-Built would not pay them. Tried to email Troy-Built with no response. Finally I got them on the phone but they said it was past 30 days since I had placed the order and tires were a normal wear item so they would not guaranteed.Also, the shift knob will not stay on.I have now had it 2 months and it has never been in the ground. Really disapointing when they have had such a good reputation -- or is it just good hype! I would NOT recommend anything they sell."
4,Big Red,"It does what it is advertised to do. My main complaint is It is too heavy and awkward to handle for woman or smaller framed folks. The shifting and engaging handles use pretty primitive technology by todays standards, making it difficult for lighter framed folks to operate the machine. Which can be a safety issue if you are not able to disengage to stop the machine."
2,Good reputation - bad product,"Troy-Bilt, have been using them since 1973, have worn out two previous 8 hp Horse models. This is the first one since MTD took over. New one a lemon. Poorly assembled (loose nuts/bolts all over it), took it to garden after going over all nuts/bolts, fired it up, engaged tines and instant metal grinding noise from transmission. Into warranty shop with less that 5 min. on it. Depends on what shop says, you may be getting this one back."
3,Nice but not what I thought,This is a nice looking bracelet but it is not as heavy as I thought. I got it on the Friday sale so it was a good deal. I would not buy this at the current price of over $300.
1,Truly a waste of two hours,"It takes a lot to drive me to write a review, but this film has just wasted two hours of mine and my husband's time, and therefore I feel strongly about it. We were attracted to the film because of the fantastic cast, and they did act beautifully. However, this was a long drawn out story with a beginning and a middle, but no end. It was painfully slow, and with hindsight, we should have given up after the first long painful hour, but we persevered in the hope it would improve. None of the characters were likeable, and therefore it was difficult to care what happened to them.... and given that the scriptwriter couldn't be bothered to create an end for the film, I can only assume he felt similarly."
2,"Read the book instead, please","Waugh's Handful of Dust is a terrific and dark novel, with funny sharp dialogue. For reasons known best to the writers of this movie, precious little of this amazing dialogue appears in the film. The direction makes the film sappy where the story is not, and loses all of the black comedy until the ending where, mercifully, the great Alec Guinness appears."
3,The Enlightenment,The book champions women's achievements but fails to capture the drama of struggle or pivotal moments of a life that leads to the quest of entrepreneurship. However there is nothing like it on the market dealing with this subject from an historical perspective.
5,Wonderful Lullabies,"From the moment that we saw Lucas Richman conduct the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra's Fiddlesticks concert debut of the title song, our 4 year-old began singing it as he lulls himself to sleep. Day is Done contains an excellent combination of original works and old favorites that are sure to calm even the wildest toddler."
4,Pennines pictorial guide.,"This book was first created over 30 years ago from one man's dedication towards the longest footpath in Britain. It's style is unique in the fact that it is actually hand written! This guide is a perfect work of art in itself, with beautifully hand crafted drawings of the sites, and perfectly created maps of the route. To top it all, it fits neatly into ones pocket. The detail to the history and sites view along this wonderful path is astounding, especially as Mr Wainwright did not even enjoy his walk along the path! For me this book is a work of art and a useful guide to this walk. Other books have better mapping and modern telephone help numbers but this one is for the collector of fine things."
3,don't be upset,"well, I must say that Mr. Nims' attempt at making a new name for himself with this album is lacking in its originality. however, this is an excellent album if you want to have a soundtrack to your relationship with God. Every note, and every line are as familiar as any other great gospel piece, and that's what makes it great. Mr. Nims has done an amazing job in capturing the true feeling, at least for me, of worship. and the truth that is the joyous celebration of God."
3,Way too uninteresting,I was hoping that the supposed 'steak flavoring' would interest my Mom's dog who loves rope toys. She really hasn't shown any interest in this toy.
3,Useful at certain times...,"I think that this is a half-and-half deal. I mean, the drive has an acceptable price, but being someone who has to back up information frequently, this does the job better, but there are much cheaper drives out there. The disks are pretty expensive, though, anywhere from less than $10 to more than $15; it depends where you buy it and how many you buy. Iomega's tech support is ridiculous, however, you'll find that they charge about $25 each time you call for help. I would recommend the Jaz drive or Castlewood's 2.2 GB Drive (cheap, huge capacity)."
2,Buy a CD-R instead,"This model is quite slow, but it's not Iomega's fault, but just a result of it using the parallel port. The usage of the parallel port also uses CPU cycles, so while the thing is copying data, you might not be able to anything else but watch the egg timer.Spend your money on a CD-R instead. A CD-R drive might cost a little bit more, but the media is MUCH cheaper, holds MUCH more data, and is more durable than the Zip format.If you must buy a Zip drive, don't buy the parallel port model, it's far too slow for impatient people (like me.)"
3,"Nice for beginners, JAZ is better","I bought this because my hard drive was running out of space and I needed a good way of organizing my personal data files. It's good. I'm somewhat disappointed in the speed with which files are accessed, but it's nice to have large 100Mb storage capacity on my diskettes.Now, however, I wish I had invested more money and instead bought the Iomega JAZ drive. With 2 gigs on each disk, it gives you virtually unlimited space that you can simply keep adding on to.If you don't have a lot of data to save, this is fine. But for the price, I'd recommend the JAZ."
3,Not bad could be Better,"It was very easy at first. I could save everything with its great 100mb zip drive. I got the portable one just so I could bring it to other places. Every place I wanted to use it (ex. friends house, office) there was NO outlet in the back to plug it in. So the fact that it is portable is nothing to go crazy about. That part is no bug woop. Installing the zip drive was really easy that was why I gave it at least 3 stars. But every time I saved something on a zip my computer froze, and I don't have a crappy computer the freezes all the time. Only with the zip. The software that comes wiith it is crap. It males everything so hard. My suggestion do what I am doing now and get a cd writer."
2,Good for one year,"I had a 100MB Zip Drive that just last with me one year. When I need it most it stop working. Now I have a lot of important data in my Zip disk and I do not have a Zip Drive. Maybe what happen to me it is rarely, but I'll tell you, I have never seen a drive that stop working like this before. Not even the old 5 1/4."
4,power cord,I like the iomega zip drive for storing things and saving spaceon my hard drive. But i don't have a power cord anymore. Where can i purchase a cord from.
4,Consider why you need a ZIP drive,"...whencomparing the ZIP drive to CDR's .. what the ZIP drive brings to thetable in spades is portability. One example, I use Napster at work (thru a LAN) all day long. At the end of my day, I simply hook up my ZIP (takes 1 minute) to my NT workstation (beware: ZIP USB does NOT work in NT) and copy all the songs. Pack it up and later at home dump all the songs in my HD. Unless you have a CD-ROM burner at work (and how many of us do?) you simply cannot replicate this kind of functionality with any other device."
3,"Sports, with a depressing twist","I met Bill Nack once, and much enjoyed his company, so I bought the book. I planned to pass it along to my son who is very much into sports. I ended up not doing so, because although sports is the frame of reference, there is a strong preoccupation with death, dying, mortality and all of that. He writes very well and effectively, but this thread ran through much of the work and I at least found it depressing to be confronted with the grave so often. If you like that sort of thing by all means buy the book. I put my copy in a local book sale."
5,"Excellent read, facinating tale","I found this book impossible to put down. It is not only a facinating story of a bad guy's struggle to go good, it also provides an abundance of facts related to the history of Baltimore's underground crime world and how the police and FBI interact with wise guys in their attempt to stop these crimes. This book is a MUST read."
5,"review of ""Wised Up'","This is a GREAT book! Amazing insight to the reality of his life and what courage he must have. To have stood up against things and not backed down, he truly turned his life around!Five stars!"
1,Not worth my time..,If you have read any other books of the gangter and mob books you will find nothing new in this one..Seen one gangter seen em all...He is not the first one to write a book.. Of turning his self in and going straight....
4,Needed accessory if shooting with Olympus DSLR,"I have only had to swap out my original for my backup Olympus battery just once in six weeks of ownership, but was suggested to me that I get an additional battery. Charge time for a fully depleted battery is 2 1/2 hours. I shot a lot of pictures on a full charge. Always good to have a back-up. Doesn't come with charger. I shoot band and music gigs for buddies and people I meet. I would recommend going ""OEM"" (Original Equipment Manufacturer) for batteries and most accessories, including flashes and lenses, with a few exceptions."
4,Buy extras. You'll need them.,"I own three Olympus E-pen cameras. This is the original battery that came with each of them. While it is a good battery, the size is small and the capacity is a little low. This means the battery can be used up pretty quick. I've started out the day with a fully charged battery only to have it run down after a couple of hours. This is probably mostly due to my keeping the camera constantly powered up and turning off the automatic shut down mode. If you only turn on the camera when you intend to take a picture, the battery will hold a charge longer. But you'll also probably miss a few pictures. Either way, having an extra battery handy is not only a good idea, it's a necessity. There are off-brand batteries available for the Olympus cameras but I've never tried any of them. They may function fine and they certainly cost less. But I'll stick to the original brand for the time being and keep several spares on hand."
4,Olympus EPL-1 Battery,"I needed a extra battery for my EPL-1 camera and Amazon provided the original replacement battery at a very reasonable price. I bought this original Olympus battery because my camera is still under warranty and I wanted original equipment.The battery worked well in the battery charger that came with the camera and charged in 3 - 4 hours, as expected. The battery fits perfectly in the camera and although I haven't had the opportunity to use it in the camera for any long period of time,I'm sure it will perform well. It was a Christmas gift."
3,Princess scooter,"product is okay...average...a little overpriced because it says ""Disney""...assembly directions and illustrations are VERY POOR!"
4,Not worth the money,"We bought this item for our 3 year old daughter. If was easy to assemble. However, after less than a week the stickers on the wheels are peeling. She likes it, but the quality does not seem to fit the price. Had I known I probably would have chosen a different scooter. The third wheel provides a little extra stability but not what I expected."
3,Case Fitting:,"The Cpu & Monitor covers were a pretty good fit but, the keyboard cover is just too flimsy & thin."
4,Just what they said they were,Just what they said they were. Nothing fancy but does the job . .. . . . . . .
1,Bad choice.,"I bought a new Dell desktop, flat screen monitor and needed dust covers to protect my investment. I ordered the ""Cables Unlimited 3 piece computer dust cover set"", because it was noted to fit the flat screen monitor. The only cover that fit, is the one for the keyboard. The monitor cover is big enough to cover my TV and the desktop cover is also way too big and sloppy, I would not recommend this product."
5,A Knockout,"Many people recommended this book to me, saying it was funny as well as emotionally powerful (the best combination, in my opinion, though all too rare). In fact, it WAS funny and packed an emotional punch. But it was also more, so much so that it's hard to say anything that doesn't sound like a cliché.It was real, many-layered, complex. It was courageous and intimate. It was heartbreaking and inspirational. It was a family portrait like no other, with no holds barred. Oh, and it was beautifully written, too.Peeking into another family's story with all its pains and pleasures might seem intrusive, but Weisman invites us in. And rewards us for it."
2,Okay,"I didn't care for her description of sex with her husband. It feel it took away from her main story,her son."
5,Haven't had a problem yet.,"I needed a power cord for my Samsung laptop so I gave this one a try. It fits perfectly and seems to be of a high quality, even though it is not the OEM cord. I have ordered from Cables Unlimited before and they have always delivered on quality cables."
1,broke imediately,Unfortunately the place where the cord meets the plug seperated to reveal the inner wire.Very dissapointed with this product.
4,Perfect for the job,"My laptop cable busted, but I didn't want to shell out a ton of money for a whole new charger when I just needed the cable. This product works great with my Dell charger."
4,"Not like picture, but still a good deal!","I purchased this item to replace my laptop's Mickey Mouse Power Cord that my daughter's puppy chewed through. I chose this particular item in large part because of the great price but also because the picture looked identical to my original cord. However, when the item arrived, the cord was not flat, as pictured, but instead round--a purely cosmetic issue since THE ITEM WORKED PERFECTLY RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX.SIDEBAR: Be sure when you're shopping for a good price that you check the shipping charge as they vary a great deal from supplier to supplier."
4,Perfect Replacement for my HP Laptop,"This was the perfect replacement for my HP nc6400 laptop power cord. The original cord bent near the strain relief and eventually exposed wires. This cord has a solid connection and does a perfect job replacing the old cord, without spending all of the money for a new power adapter."
2,Not what is pictured,"I ordered this cord because the picture shows a flat cord that would wrap nicely around the laptop adapter (like the one the laptop came with). Instead I received the same cord available from other sellers for a fraction of the price. Save your money, order the cheaper one."
4,Fine,"Work quite well.especially for those foreigners with their native laptops._ _(o)--(o)/.______.\\________/./ \.( . , )\ \_\\//_/ /~~ ~~ ~~"
2,Poor Quality,Only used it lightly for a week or so and the wire was separating from the plug. Very unhappy with it.
5,Solid cable!,"It's a power cable so there's not much to say about it, but it does the job! No problems with it."
4,good but not perfect,"The cable I got was good, but not the flat cord as shown in the picture. Definitely not the best design for a laptop charger. Also, the cord comes straight from the Mickey Mouse connector, not to a side - it will stress there too much if you wrap the cord around the power adapter and break eventually."
3,Not as pictured or described,Product photo shows Mickey Mouse Power Cord with flat cabels (wires) - described as 6-feet - exactly what I was looking for.Recieved 12 foot long Michey Mouse Power Cords with ROUND cabels.They are of good quality - but not as pictured or described - will keep them.Would still like to find the Power Plugs I ordered originally.
2,Fried my Charger,"I have a feeling that my laptop charger was already mostly fried when I bought this to replace my Mickey Mouse cable, but nevertheless, DO NOT USE THIS TO REPLACE THE CABLE ON YOUR DELL CHARGER. I have a feeling that it will not be compatible with any Dell charger, whether it's already half fried or no. Just buy a new charger."
5,solution for all my cables,"I bought a computer in Italy and when I tried to connect it in South America I found this model that You call Mickey, but with european end, then a friend say to me that was the same of HP printers, but the sellers didn't have an extra for me, so I think in Amazon, and there is always a solution, Thank you very much"
4,The power cord is good.,The delivery was in time. The cord is strong and the length is okay. I am using this cord to the adapter of my IBM thinkpad laptop and it is working properly. I hope this cord will be durable also. The product provided the worth of my purchase.
5,Does what it's meant to do,"This cable fit my old mickey mouse laptop adapter, plugged into the wall and worked. Nothing else could be said about this... It does its job! Thanks"
1,Broke within a week,Cable stopped working the first week. Cheaply made and fell apart at one end. Pay the extra money for a Quality cable
5,Should have ordered a couple of these,"I got home from my annual beach vacation and realized I had left my power cord at the beach house. This is a perfect replacement. It is a round cord, nice and heavy. No worrying about whether your laptop is getting enough juice. The fit into the power brick is excellent.I was a little worried about buying a ""cheap"" replacement, but when this cord arrived I was pleased. I might order another to leave plugged in at my desk so i don't have to reach down to the surge protector anymore. If you need a replacement or are just thinking about buying another for convenience, go for it."
5,Mickey Mouse Couldn't Make a Better Cord Himself,"It's a cord, it provides power to things with the same shaped hole... what more could I ask for? Nothing, I dare say."
5,Great quality cord,"The power cord that came with my Lenovo laptop was only about three feet long, which is a too short unless you are sitting right next to the outlet. This cord is a perfect replacement. As another reviewer pointed out, the cord is round and not flat like the one pictured. However, it rolls up just fine and it's extra bulk is really due to its length.The price when I purchased it was absolutely unbeatable."
5,Mickey Mouse cord,"Excellent price, good shipping, and overall a very good product. I would definitely recommend buying this type of product from this seller."
3,Lethargic Tempi and Lack of Emotional Depth,"This performance is technically more than competent (both vocally and orchestrally), but the tempi are truly lethargic and there is a conspicuous lack of emotional engagement with this great music. Seek out other performances of these masterpieces. For example, Christa Ludwig recorded the Ruckert Lieder and Kindertotenlieder with Karajan. Those performances are infinitely more musical (and moving) than these rather lackluster interpretations."
2,Superficial Performances Lacking Emotional Depth,"Frankly, these performances are very disappointing. Schmidt sings smoothly and cleanly, but he fails to plumb the emotional depths of this great music. I recommend that you purchase Dame Janet Baker's performances (available on EMI Great Recordings of the Century) or Christa Ludwig's performances, or Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's. There are wonderful performances of these masterpieces readily available, so don't settle for these emotionally tepid run-throughs."
4,Princeton Tec Shockwave Dive Light,"I bought this to replace the one I had and it doesn't disappoint. I had to mess with the switch a little bit when I first got it, but now it's working fine."
1,Switch breaks very easily - faulty design. Stay away from this light!,"Apparently, this is happening to lots of people. I regret not looking at online reviews by consumers instead of just one's in the dive magazines before buying it.The Priceton Tec Shockwave II has known issues with a poor switch design. Mine broke on my 1st dive trip with it. My friend's literally SNAPPED in half on his 2nd trip. It's a very poor design!To put that in perspective - my UK 1200, 8 D Cell light is still going strong after 15 years! In fact, ALL my UK lights are still working - all of them are at least 10 years old.This was my first and last light from Princeton Tec. An excellent warranty isn't worthwhile when the light breaks while you are 5000 miles from home on an island, having a vacation!I imagine that the switch is the same here as on the LCD version but I don't know that for sure and won't take a chance on Princeton Tec again. Dive gear needs to be RELIABLE!"
3,display?,"recently ordered the JBL mr4wg. the radio arrived in a shipping box, but the box the radio was in, did not have any packaging, everything was thrown into the box. the radio face had scrathes, it made me think that the radio was a store display..."
5,Prophecy fulfilling earthquake,"In 1984, on Wednesday April 18th while I was driving from Modesto to go to work in Turlock, California,the Lord predicted that there would be an earthquake on Tuesday.This prophecy was given to the congregation of the Good News Baptist Church during our Passover celebration, while I was serving as Pastor there. It came to pass just as the Lord had predicted. He also predicted that night, that there would be an earthquake on Tuesday, and many people would die. The Loma Preita Earthquake was that second predicted earthquake. It happened October 17th on Tuesday, in 1989.GOD KNOWS WHEN THESE EARTHQUAKES WILL HAPPEN. and sometimes the will let us know in advance that they are coming.All of this is recorded in the book ""WHO IS GOD, AND WHAT HAS HE EVER DONE FOR US?"" written by me: David L.Jemison."
1,"If you want porn, get it somewhere else!!","This movie might have appeal for someone wanting to experience cornball memorabilia, but DON'T waste time or money on this movie. It is nothing like Groove Tube or KFriedMovie. It is a loser."
5,"Gorgeous Clarity of Sound, Relaxed, Seasoned Playing","Sony's really on to something with their Direct Stream Digital recording system. It puts you in the room; you're there. The clarity of the individual instrumental voices is nothing short of astonishing. You're enfolded in that wonderful woody acoustic bass sound, and the drums resonate with every stroke of the ride cymbal.It was pure genius pairing this system with this group. Tight scarcely describes them. Telepathic is more like it. These musicians are incredibly attuned to each other. What you get is a kind of absolute straight-ahead jazz, the kind that I've wished for for a long time, but seldom found. For it's type, this music is unbeatable. Highest recommendation."
3,A lot for the money...,"but unless you are really motivated in learning how to use it...and that you have plenty of volunteers, this kit will remain in the closet forever!! The instructions are pathetic; and the video is even worse."
4,Lots of fun,"This book is full of interesting problems on algorithms. I have solved several of the problems in this book and it was great fun. Just thinking about solving so of these problems is interesting. I spent several hours solving the problem that is on the cover, it required the use Concrete Mathematics (0201558025), so be prepared many if not most of the problems in this book are very hard."
4,Very interesting book.,I love everything Disney. This book with filled with interesting facts beautiful pictures. I love that is a hard back and thought it was a great price.
2,????,The openness of he drug trade of the time is the more interesting part to me. the crown doctor and his madness is tne aspect most other films in the past never looked into because of the Crown.
5,Heima,This is a great Video. Just ck out how many 5 stars it has. Also ck out the new book and DVD that just came out with many pictures of the band and a great video of the band working at abbey road.
5,"Sigur Rós, film Heima","Sigur Rós is absolutely my favorite band, and I loved this film. Gorgeous footage and phenomenal music with a story about the band told very personably. I highly recommend it."
5,Who's Sigur Ros?,"Haven't heard of Sigur Ros? Don't know their music? This DVD is a great place to start!!!Not only do you get a ""best of"" in terms of the music, but it is all set to the most amazing scenery that's beautifully and sensitively filmed.In fact some of the versions of their tracks are better on this DVD than on the album. There's a pureness and vulnerability that comes from performing in a community hall in front of fifty people. Or performing acoustically on the soon to be dam bed. And the natural sound of the glacier. Amazing!The DVD is both Dolby Digital and DTS. The camera work is great. So to is the commentary.The music, the topography, the interviews - this DVD is a gem!!"
5,"only ""Beautiful"" can describe it","There's no way you can watch this and not be blown away. I think it's awesome to see a band put their money into making a DVD with such high quality. The footage is all from HD cameras, with absolutely no home camcorder footage, so it never loses that feel. Even when they perform out in open fields, the audio quality is crystal clear (and actually better than the studio albums). The overall mood it puts you in is much more powerful than any music DVD I've ever owned.This DVD is worth every penny."
5,Extraordinary feast for the eyes and ears,"The extraordinary, soaring beauty of ""Heima"" is beyond compare to almost anything I've seen or heard on the screen. The makers of this film have crafted a near-perfect document of sound and vision. Produced with just enough studio and cutting-room floor trickery, ""Heima"" showcases the Icelandic homeland with a singular reverence for its awesome natural majesty while presenting the musicians as humble subjects of the people for whom they perform. It is a moving, emotional film that I guarantee will transport you to a higher plane."
5,Amazing,I have never seen anything like this. It's absolutely amazing. Sigur Ros is awesome and this DVD seems to capture their essence. Get it!
5,Sublime,Could go into detail about Iceland etc. But Why bother. This DVD is pure quality from the first second to the last.I promise you will not regret this purchase. I will personally refund your money if you do!Absolutely SUBLIME stuff. Buy now.
3,Buyer Beware,"As a Title, this 2 disc DVD is a great companion for Sigur Ros fans who have not seen live perfomances and might want to take a look at the band on their natural enviroment, the beatiful and desolates Icelandic landscapes. But don't belive the product description on the back cover because it offers subtitles for the documentary on at least six different languages, incluiding danish, spanish and portuguese, but it only has english and japanese(ironically this last one isn't mentioned). Too bad for this great band to have such inaccurate advertisement (in some countries this might be cosidered fraud)."
4,Music is second to location shots.,"Heima (Dean DeBlois, 2007)DeBlois (Lilo and Stitch) chronicles the 2006 homecoming of Icelandic shoegaze band Sigur Rós, which combines the usual documentary-style interviews and location shots with footage of twelve concerts the band played in their native land, all free, all unannounced. A must, obviously, for fans of the band, but others will find themselves enchanted by the location footage, of which the decision to include so much must have been a conscious one (after all, the film's name, translated, is ""Home""); at times it feels a lot less like a documentary about a rock band than it does a documentary about Iceland that happens to include a live soundtrack. Worth checking out even if you've never heard of Sigur Rós. ***"
5,Beautiful documentary!,"This documentary is absolutely gorgeous, both visually and aurally. The film consists of interviews with the band, concert footage in their homeland of Iceland, and breathtaking landscapes. The concert shown includes great backstage views, as well as a audience member's view of a very non-traditional concert.If you're a fan of Sigur Ros, I highly recommend seeing this film. You will not be disappointed. Even if you're not a fan, it's worth seeing for the imagery alone."
5,Visually and Audibly stunning.,"Sigur Rós' film of their concerts all over Iceland is quite simply a feast for your eyes and ears. The music is beautiful as it should be, and for a Sigur Rós fan, the film and the second disc with more concert footage are an no-brainer must buy. Even if you're not a big fan of Sigur Rós however, the stunning landscapes of Iceland are unbelievably gorgeous. I was continually taken aback at the beauty of Iceland and coupled with the music of Sigur Rós it could not have been more perfect. One of the best purchases I've ever made."
5,"heima, the dreamland of Sigur Ros","when i listen to sigur ros' music i always dream of icelandic landscapes, montains, valleys, colours. when you play the movie is like watching your inner dreams. A colourfull movie that keeps daily life away with the main character, sigur ros' music, filling your senses. The idea is to show the free and improvised concerts that sigur ros made in Iceland on 2006 tour. a splendid documentary on music and nature."
5,Wow. Just...wow.,"OK, maybe Sigur Ros isn't the type of music to drive around tapping your toes to, but watching this on the plasma screen and cranking the surround sound was truly an experience to behold. The last song ""Popplagid"" (also known as Number 8 on the untitled CD) was a whirlwind that left me as high as a kite. Amazing scenery of Iceland as well."
5,Joy for the Eyes and Ears,"For any and all who have already encountered (and, thus, fallen in love with) this Icelandic ""quartet"" of sorts, this DVD not only provides an indispensable glimpse into the country that made them, but is itself an overwhelmingly beautiful experience. I recommend it to anyone who loves beauty, truth, and goodness. Buy it -- watch it -- show your friends. And turn off your TV."
3,Not to be sent to sister as a gift!,This book was a gift for my sister who recently got engaged. It seemed like a good book and she was happy with it. I had it mailed directly to her. What I didn't appreciate was that I paid almost twenty dollars for it and it shows up at my sister's house with a $3 price tag on it that the seller was apparently incapable of removing. Especially since it was a gift!
4,"Great for information, but not organization","If you already have Sheryl Paul's The Conscious Bride (a must-have, really), this planner may be a bit redundant. While the information is very helpful, it's basically the same information as The Conscious Bride, and it doesn't provide as many of the organizing resources as other planners. Most brides would do well with either the original book or this planner, but both may be emotional overkill."
5,Perfect Planner,"This planner is perfect! It helps you to stay focused on what your wedding is really about by discussing not just the practical but also the emotional aspects of wedding planning. It acknowledges that a wedding is a rite of passage and just the beginning. This book will help you arrive at your wedding day feeling calm and ready with simple reminders like, ""It's not about the dress!"" This is a great book for every bride who wants a marriage and not just a wedding."
4,Decent shirt,"Not bad but not the greatest. The material is fine, no sweat fabric and is very light. Fit seems fine, I like the UA tanks better though."
4,are excellent!,"are excellent, nice and comfortable, and very very importantly, are very cheap!I saw them in a store and liked."
3,"Great shirt, neck's too small","This is a nice quality sleeveless workout shirt, except the neck is too small. The weight is good, and it's very comfortable otherwise. I have one of the same product I bought in 2008 that I love and so I wanted another. Somehow since then the necks seem to have gotten smaller, and I had to send mine back because of this."
4,"Very comfortable, dries quickly, and fits nicely","I've been using this shirt for running / training.Pros:- Very comfortable, feels like a cotton shirt.- Soaks up less moisture and dries quickly during and after running.- The neck hole is smaller than I expected, which creates a nicer fit in my opinion.Cons:- As other reviewers have noted, the white version of this shirt is revealing."
1,never received,"I have yet to receive this order. The vendor said I would receive a refund, but I have yet to receive that. Not impressed."
1,Poor manufacturing and on the large side,"It's great that these are so thin - they air out really well. However, they're also translucent because of that. White is not a good color for these. They also seem to fit on the large side. The neck/collars were inconsistent. They look like they're stretched out due to the angle they were sewn in at and I one that I could barely get my head through while the others were fine. Definitely not the quality I expected."
1,Story drags,"The husband is likable, the heroine is apprehensive. The former mistress is a stalker, mean, and not averse to use violence. This is a typical Helen Bianchin storyline. The story drags on and on like this, and it gets very boring."
5,thanx,i just wanted to say to the person who reviewd this book... awesome. i'm trying to re-collect all of my first romance novels (i had over 100) and it is soo hard to remember the one's that went way back; ie around the time of this one. usually all i can remember is a cover or the plotline. so when it comes to books this old i have to rely on other people's reviews and this is one of the one's i realllllly wanted so thank you very much. you made my night
4,Perfect,I bought this for my husband who still plays his ole school games. He gets so into it that I have to make him eat or he will just sit and play the whole weekend. Perfect for him
4,From the Heart,Deb Deitz writes from the heart in this personal poetic expose of being a woman making a turn for the better in her life.
5,Journal of very positive futures!,"I have subscribed to Yes! Magazine since it's inception about 12 years ago. It is an upbeat, positive alternative magazine that highlights real issues and real solutions to some of the most pressing problems of the day. There are no ads in the magazine - it's supported by subscriptions and donations. I even bought a 3-year gift subscription for my local public library to make it accessible to more people - it's readable, informative, and it's printed on New Leaf Paper with 100% recycled fiber, 50% post-consumer wast, and processed chlorine free, so you feel good about the environmental benefits of reading it - it's a quarterly, so you have time to read it cover-to-cover, while eagerly awaiting the next great issue!"
5,One of the best magazines out there!,"This is a great magazine, showing all the positive things that people are doing to make the world better. I've learned a lot reading it. It shows how there are still a lot of people with hope and happiness."
4,Good read...Well researched.,"Not only is this a good read into the history of the Harvard/Yale rivalry, but it is also a nice glimpse into the origin and development of college football as well as the development of the sport of football as it is played today. As a fan of an SEC school, it definitely gave me an appreciation of the Ivy League."
3,Beware of this teleconverters,"Anyone who is looking for to buy teleconverter, beware that this are not for every lens you have. It is specifically made to fit in to fast lenses such as F 2.8, 4.0 etc. If you have a zoom lens with variable focal lenths this teleconverter will not fit. Before you buy please check whether your lens meets their criteria."
1,"Good writing, bad history of science","I read this about the time it came out, as I read everything Eisley wrote. Unfortunately, his thesis is based on a misunderstanding of early 19th century natural history and the role of natural selection. Natural selection was widely recognized as occurring, but was nearly universally perceived as a force which prevented change of a species by eliminating individuals that varied too far from the median type. This is how Edward Blyth viewed natural selection.Darwin's genius is that he recognized that natural selection was also a force for ""creativity"" in that if an heritable variation was better adapted natural selection would direct the species' population in that direction. There is a good explanation of 19th century views on the role of natural selection and Darwin's contribution in Stephen Jay Gould's book 'The Structure of Evolutionary Theory"", a relevant portion of which is available on-line at [...]"
1,Don't waste your money!,Bought them and then they didn't reach even 200 ft to the garage. Had to put the unit in the closest room to the garage an they still didn't work well. JUNK!!Now I now know why they were on clearence. $[...] bucks down the tube.
5,Work great,"Ordered 3. Two worked, #3 would not talk to other two. Called Chamberlain and they authorized a return. They immediately replaced the defective one. The new one works great. Easy to use. Simple to set up. Incredible volume (maybe even a bit loud). Yes, I would recommend."
4,Very pleased after several months,"After reading several negative reviews, I'm surprised and maybe just lucky? I have two units that have been flawless. The battery life is great. They have been left on overnight and even over the weekend and are still using the original batteries. The sound quality is excellent. The distance is only about 30 feet in my office. I'm now expanding personnel and office space and going to buy two more units to add to the system. I don't know about long term durability. I tried a pair of Westinghouse intercoms and returned them since they didn't work after about 20 minutes of use. Replaced them with the Recorders and am very pleased so far."
1,An expensive disaster,"I replaced 4 Novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 Reporters. Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands. Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use. Failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units, no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit... all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions. Don't waste your money."
2,maybe I'm stupid but...,"I'm finding it kind of difficult to get it started cutting, so the bag will get kind of wrinkly and not cut a very staight line"
4,Good results,"Despite the fact that this product is very light and does not seem substantial, it works very well. You must get the technique right. You can cut in either direction and it cuts a straight line, which I can't do with just scissors. After trying it, I bought a second one so I would have one for each size bag roll and I bought two for my sister as a gift."
4,Handy tool for do it yourself bag makers,It works ok. You must have a straight edge on the roll bags. Cutter is a bit cheap but does the job...Saves money to use rolls of bags...
5,If You Want More Zoom and Minimal Distortion,"I bought this converter for the Nikon 70-200mm VR lens to cover extend my range when I upgraded from a D300 to a D3 and lost the 1.5x factor I had with the D300. It works great with my f/2.8 70-200mm VR lens and the results are sharp at f/4 (the minimum aperture for the aforementioned lens with the tele, but the pictures really shine when stopped down to f/5.6. It's worth the investment, easy to carry around. I thank Ken Rockwell for advising me on this product and guiding me to Amazon's exceptional service. This product really makes a difference, less cropping needed for those hard to reach shots."
5,Nikon TC-14EII teleconverter is so helpful and useful.,"This item makes my photography sessions all the more pleasant because the objects appear to be so clear and precise and the wonderful feature of just ""bringing the subject up so close"" is wonderful. A friend recommended this item to me and I am grateful to him for that. I especially enjoy bird and wildlife photography so this teleconverter makes each session much more successful. Since I am having better luck with my photos, I seem to want to just shoot photos all the time - to heck with dishes, cleaning, and other annoying chores. More pictures.!!!"
4,Extra Reach,I purchased this to match up with the AF 200-400mm f4 VR Nikon to give me that bit of extra reach when photographing birds. It does just that. The resolution of the image is near perfect. However when shooting at f4 in low light situations the auto focus has some trouble. At 5.6 and above it does fine. I opted for the 1.4 over the 2.0 as I shoot in low light more often than not. The extra magnification wasn't worth the light loss. I wasn't impressed by what I had heard about the 1.7 although a few pros match it with the above lens. This is a nice addition to my camera equipment. I am very pleaed with it at this point
4,Almost Perfect Pitch,"This disc is one of my favorites for the sheer intensity of the music more than anything else. The tunes are intricate and evolve intellectually throughout. The ""Organ"" Symphony gives the impression of attending a Command Performance at which the dignitary arrives about 30 fashionable minutes late. The organ and the orchestra were recorded in separate locations. So, once the organ arrives one gets the definite impression that the orchestra is deliberately pacing itself to allow the organ to keep up. This usually doesn't bother me because the organ is supposed to take center stage at this point anyway. The inclusion of Phaeton make a perfect companion piece. It almost feels like a 3rd movement to the ""Organ"" as it has similar hair-pin turn themes and is just as inspired."
3,Not enough chapter stops,"My children never listen to this version of the Organ Symphony since there are only two chapter stops. They always choose the Dutoit version which has four chapter stops including a chapter stop for the thrilling entrance of the organ (""Maestoso"") in the second movement."
1,Ugh....,I like the fact that this bread is actually low in calories - 2 slices 80 calories...but its really dry and tasteless. Just not what I want in a bread.
5,What else Can I Say?,What else can I say but -- this is a beautiful print of one terrific piece of classic op-art. Put it in a wide square black wood frame and it is gorgeous. Vasarely was a genius.
5,Amazing,"This was my Honey Man's favorite artist. The song "" Song for you"" has so much meaning - we have danced in the kitchen, on the patio, ..... he even sang me the song when I was laying in the emergancy room with broken ribs. Leon Russell does not just ""sing""... This CD is a reflection of one talented man - and I truly value it! He touches a part of you...."
4,Great Songs! Average Remaster,"I loved the song ""Tight Rope"" as a kid growing up in the 1970s, so getting this affordable collection was a must. But I will say I am disappointed with the sound quality. If this CD is remastered like it claims, it falls short of today's high tech remastering quality. Heck, I've heard remasters of some 1960s songs sound so crisp when remastered with today's high quality standards (such as Eric Records' fantastic ""Hard to Find 45s on CD"" series). The problem with this CD is the consistency of sound quality. ""Tight Rope"" and ""Roll Away the Stone"" sound great, but other tracks sound muddy and compressed. Buyer beware."
2,best of leon russell,some good some not so good leon has a lot of good music but only a few per album
2,times have changed,back in the 70's I was so in love with this artist. I had every record he did. I didn't like this one. the quaility of the sound was so terrible and The selection of his best was not his best made me wonder why I was so gaga over him. There was so many other songs he did that were far better. I have to say I'm not a fan of this CD
2,Beautiful but Broke almost immediately,"The strand was beautiful, although not all the pearls matched well in the terms of luminosity, and a few had ripples, but pearls are not perfect. I was thrilled when I took it out of the box. It comes in a wonderful padded booklet type storage folder, quite elegant. I wore it to work today and 5 hours into my day, I went to re-adjust the strand, as I had it doubled on my neck, and with one little lift and very light tug at the strand it pulled apart and sent a pearl flying across the floor. Its going back and as much as I'd love to order a replacement, I would never feel confident it wouldn't happen again. I have a 40 dollar strand I bought on Amazon a couple of months ago, with less perfect pearls, and I use it as a lanyard for my flashdrive. Never had any problems with that one. Much as I wanted to love this strand, I can't trust it now. This is something I would want to be aware of, if I were thinking of buying."
5,Escalator to heaven,"Well, if you're a fan of the Stingrays (DEFINATELY not to be confused by the other two bands of same name}, then this is a must! This is the quintessential CD. Although much to my sorrow it does not contain such classics as Blue Girl or My flash on you, it takes nothing away from the excellent tunes portrayed here. So ... if you had a Psycho flat top in the early 80's this is a wonderful meandering trip down memory lane. Maybe you're a Trash or Garage fan, this will serve equally well to go some way into giving you some delightful riffs and that lovely double bass, coupled with Bal's legendary vocals. Buy this and you won't regret it."
1,It broke after a month.,"I used to blow dry my metal eyelash curler and bought this one to save me some time. It didn't turn out that way. The heating mechanism takes FOREVER to heat up. You're better off using a non-heated one.After about 3 weeks of daily use, the heating mechanism stopped working but I continued to use it anyway (as a manual no-heat curler) and after a week, the plastic on the top of the curler split in two."
1,don't bother,"The mascara is nice as an extra. It's black and there is no choice it just comes as a package. The curler can't generate enough force for the heat to be an added curling effect. I don't understand the whole product. If it is to be like a curling iron for eyelashes it leaves a lot to be desired as a concept. It can't by virtue of where it's used get too hot. The old fashioned kind does a much better job because of the tension it can exert. The heat(warm)here does nothing. I tried heated first then conventional, but it's no better. Basically this product is a failure."
4,Bargains galore! Great tips too.,This book did a great job of proving you don't have to spend your child's college tuition on them before they enter kindergarten. Wonderful source of bargains and where to find them. Good job of brand and price comparison.
4,Liked the Agressive Gal!,If you skipped over the age related parts of the novel...its a very good book. But it does seem kind of creepy to have a 17 year old kid and a mid thirty year old man to have attraction. Of course I wouldn't have thought so much of it had Warren not taken such offense to it. There have been huge differences in ages in other novels that didn't bother me at all. I liked that Amy was aggressive...but when they kept mentioning her age...well then it transformed into childish antics. BUT like I said if you skip over the mentions of the age difference...I thought the book was excellent. I didn't even mind Warren's constantly bellowing having become aquainted with him in the Gentle Rogue novel. ALSO you must read Gentle Rogue and Tender Rebel first so that you catch up on their stories. This is a totally worth while read.
5,the Mallory's are HOT,"The Mallory stories are the best. I love the whole series. If I had to name one absolute favourite, it would have to be 'The Magic of You'. I love the way Amy doesn't let Warren ignore her, no matter how hard he tries. Amy has alot of spirit and is exceedingly brazen, which both shocks and excites Warren. Warren just doesn't know how to handle Amy, or the passion that flares between them. All she wants to do is make him happy. How can he be happy if they aren't together? This is a firm favourite that I have read over and over again. Bring on more Mallory stories."
3,Well written story about the Malory's...but not a true romance.,"I have been a fan of Ms Lindsey since the 80s and have read most of her books.This is a great Malory novel. With wonderful well developed characters. For those who enjoyed James and Georgina from Gentle Rogue, here we get to see a lot of them again.However the hero in this story is Georgina's older brother Warren. And he is the biggest jerk I have ever come found in a romance novel. I know Ms. Lindsey's hero's are not the sweet gentle type, but this guy had no good qualities at all. with the exception that he loved his sister to death.Amy would have been wonderful...However her constant chasing after Warren really bothered me. Aside from the fact that he never seemd to appreciate it one bit.Sadly I sound no tenderness, no chemistry and no romance at all between Amy and Warren. And the love scenes very also very sadly lacking.Three stars because I liked the family soooooo much!!!"
3,Great book....,"i liked The Magic of You, but there are a few things i didn't care for. For one the age difference is 18 years .Now thats great and everything, but personally if someone in the relasionship could possibly be your parent, that's too big of a diff.Another reason would be is when Amy said straight out to Warren she wanted him. That's great! For once there was a woman in a historical novel who wasn't shy and quiet in the cases of things in the bedroom,most blush at anything the guy said. Amy was tough but cause she was only 17 going on to 18, she was a little naive.Anyways, those are my thoughts, and Joanna Lindsey is a fantastic writer. I recommend all of her books, especially the Malory novels! Ahh*tear* :( i think i have read all them! I hope she writes a story for Drew Anderson- Georgina's brother! :)!!"
5,Awesome,I've read all of the Malory Novels so far and love all of them! Great read if you like historical romace.
5,The Magic of you,Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read the next Malory novel. Thanks for the adventure. What a blast.
1,Has to skim...A LOT....,"This is basically a story about the h chasing the H the ENTIRE book. It wasn't until almost the last page that the H even consents to marrying the h and even then he acts as if he is doing her a favor. I just don't understand why readers would want these two together. The H constantly rejects the h in the cruelest words he can find the entire book and just because he begrudgingly asks her to marry her in the last page of the book that is suppose to be a HEA? For me, not so much. I found the h to be pathetically annoying for chasing a guy that constantly told her that he didn't want her and the H a whinny, indecisive character. For a romance novel there was little romance to between H and h."
5,ANOTHER WINNER!!,"This is the fourth installment of the Mallory series. It is the story of Amy Mallory and Warren Anderson. Amy Mallory is another niece of the handsome Mallory brothers. She has set her sights on Warren Anderson, Georgina Mallory's brother. Warren, who was hurt in the past, has sworn to never love again. Well, he never met anyone like Amy. She's determined to have him and he's determined to avoid her. But no matter how much he tries, he can't resist her. They are fantastic together. I absolutely love the way James and Anthony try to provoke Warren who has a temper from hell, talk about explosive. But thanks to Amy, Warren learns to love again and calm the anger that boils within which really ticks James and Anthony off. They hate being ignored. This is a wonderful story filled with love, danger, inner conflict, and definitely laughter. You'll love it and the other Mallory novels."
3,Magical but not Miraculous...,"I liked the idea of a reverse from the norm... having Amy chase after Warren... but Warren's just not as lovable as James and Tony... so I guess you could say the British scoundrels spoiled me. I did enjoy the book, especially when the couple was discovered in bed together... by the scoundrels no less! I just didn't enjoy it as thoroughly as previous Malory tales. Still, just for introducing the world to the Malory clan, I'll remain a faithful Lindsey fan!!! Besides I'm waiting to see who will be able to crack the calm facade of Thomas Anderson! Now that would be worth chasing after!"
2,Stubborn Amy & Warren,"This 4th book in the Malory's series is perhaps the worst book in the series. Both characters (the hero and heroine) are stubborn and selfish. For me, Amy and Warren do not fit the criteria of becoming lovers in the book. The love between them looks forced and sometimes jerky. The book have lots of holes in its plot.I would not recommend it as a good buy. Consider it as a waste of money."
4,Energizing,"I Would Agree To An Extent That Amy Was A Bit Much...But She Grows On You, She Is A Mallory After All, And Are They All Not Outspoken And Blatant? What Should Make Amy Malory Any Different, Her Sex?And I Simple Love Warren, Amy Was Truly His Match As He Was Hers.Andie"
4,Enjoyable,"This is one of my favorite of the Malory series. The characters are lovable and heart warming. It is easy to read from the very beginning and the ending leaves you feeling happy and fulfilled. Saying, this book leaves nothing lacking and a must read romance lovers."
3,"Annoying, seriously annoying.","The plot was fine, fairly entertaining although overly dramatic. Certainly not worth a second read. (Spoiler) The whole kidnapping things is just a little over-the-top, and seriously, why why why didn't Amy start screaming?Amy is a stalker, seriously obsessed. Warren is a grouch but having a psycho stalker would irritate anyone. There's little actual romance.The constant hatred and malice between the men is utterly overdone and has grown tiresome. It no longer serves the plot and is just ugliness. It's time for the characters to evolve, grow and act like adults.However, the voice of the audio book, Laural Merlington, needs to stop adding the giggle, chuckle or laugh EVERY time a character does. It was the most irritating thing about this audio book and almost had me tossing the book just so I didn't have to listen to the faux giggles/laughter. Her (in)ability to do voices did not add to the book."
4,My Opinion,"Not my favorite in the Malory series, but a must to read. See Reviewer ""#4 in the Mallory Series"". A Good review of the book. I'm not great on reviews, so I refer to others who have done a great job at it. A good story and wonderful addition to the Malory stories. My favorite of the Malory series is still ""Gentle Rouge"" where the Anderson family are introduced. I hope Lindsey's writes some books about them. Not just Warren. But you should read all the Malory books, they are all good."
2,"Of the five Malory books, four were really good.","Warren was not worth chasing! I did not think that the plot in this book was realistic. The rest of the Malorys had style. This, unfortunetly, did not. Johanna Lindsey will always be my favorite author and I love her series books. However I didn't feel The Magic Of You meet the standards of the Malorys before and after. It just didn't have that charming quality."
2,Disappointing,"I was so looking forward to this book, after I read James and George's book, but what a major let down this book was. First of all they kept expressing in the book the age difference between Amy and Warren which I was trying to over look but couldn't. Secondly Amy was pretty much what we would called in todays society a stalker. Third the hero and his attitude was over the top. The only saving grace for this book was the appearance of the other Malorys James, George and Tony."
4,4.5 stars. The heroine wowed me. It was hard to put down.,"I was shaking my head and smiling at the unbelievable boldness of the heroine Amy and her tenacity, even though she was repeatedly rejected. It was interesting for a change to have a hero who was arrogant, cynical, brooding and hated women. This was different, a good story and very enjoyable.Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: one. Setting: 1819 London. Copyright: 1993. Genre: regency romance.For a list of my reviews of other Johanna Lindsey books, see my 5 star review of ""Gentle Rogue"" posted 6/14/08."
4,The Magic of You,I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. Usually it's the man who is shown pursuing while the female resists. I LOVED that Amy knew what she wanted and went after him. I thought it was great. I wish more books were written showing an aggressive woman in pursuit of a man. Girl Power!
2,Not her best,"This was not the best one of her novels. Most of the time the interaction is somewhat funny, and I always felt the guys somehow deserved the girl. This one was not funny, and by the end I felt Warren was a scumbag, definitely not worthy of the wonderful Amy. He did not seem to have any positive character traits, he was angry and depressing."
4,Another Smash Hit,"In this book Johanna Lindsey continues with her women being outspoken, and her men being formiddable. Warren is a cold and unfeeling man except when Meghans back is turned. Megan is always one step away from just stripping naked and telling him to take her. Although the heroine in this book appears to be a little over board half the time she creates the most romantic of situations. Warren however will do anything he can to keep her from unfreezing his bitterly cold heart. The only way it unfreezes is by him loosing her love. Then he knows how cold life can be with out her."
1,BORING,"I couldn't believe what I was reading was from Johanna Lindsey, the other books about the Malory family is far more entertaining than this book, I couldn't even finished it. I love Johanna Lindsey and have been reading her books for well over 13 years now. She's done better."
5,This was too good!,"I loved this book, it was excellent, especially when James, Tony, & Connie caught Warren & Amy in bed!! I though James was going to lose it!!! It was great. But I though Warren was Georgie's second oldest brother, not her oldest?? I thought that was Clint???? Can someone help me out here, I don't have my eithe Gentle Rogue or this one here with me"
1,Amy Mallory is Kinda Skanky!,"This book is awful, it's the worst of the Malory series and a real disappointment. I hated the lead characters especially Amy Malory, what a spoiled little brat! Her stupid behavior caused so many problems for everyone and the self absorbed twit just didn't care and she was kinda skanky!"
5,My fav Johanna`s book!!,"First of all I have to say that I always knew that Johanna will write a book about Warren, since I read `Gentle Rouge`. I was sooo charmed by Georgina`s refractory brother, really))So, War (as I call him, because of his famous `terrible temper`)) was so brave but still pitifull with his hope to dissuade Amy with her plans to seduce him, ah huh))And, yes - Amy is one of my fav Johanna`s female characters, as War with male. They are both so obstinate, so `desperado` if you know what I mean))"
3,Different than the usual typical story,"This is not a good bet for the Malory family die hard fans. But,the unusual can be expected since this story is about a woman's seducing on man. Our beloved Amy Malory was a daring woman, with many ideas on seducing Warren Anderson, James Malory's brother-in-law. Warren kept a secret of long lost love, and heart broken, he became a stubborn man. He didn't want to know the meaning of being in love again but Amy will surely try to change this conception and make Warren fall in love again -with her!"
5,The Magic of J.L.,"I have been a HUGE fan of Johanna Lindsey's for about a decade. I absolutely LOVE the Mallory series. While I enjoyed all the books in the series, I have to say that I enjoyed ""The Magic of You"" & ""Love Only Once"" the best. I really enjoyed seeing the story of Amy & Warren unravel. I also liked the fact that Nicolas Eden wasnt the only nephew in-law that brought out the sarcastic banter in my 2 favorite Mallory boys (Tony & James). I can only hope that Ms.Lindsey will continue to grace us with more tales of the Mallory (& Anderson) Clan. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, that she will grant us the stories of Jeremy Mallory & Drew Anderson (& any of the others). I highly recommend any of the Mallory series."
5,I want to be like Amy,this is one of the best books that i have ever read. i have read this book about more the 10 times. I do recommend that you read this..i fell in love it! I wish that i had my own Warren.
3,Very basic.,"Like the title says, this is a very basic book. It would be great for someone that knows absolutely nothing about the history of knives. Anyone who is a collector or has any knowledge of knives can skip this book.It is a very short book. It reminds me of something my elementary school library would have had."
3,Depends On What You Want,"I checked out this book from the library in addition to a few others so I could learn more about the geology of this region while planning a trip through Alberta and Western Montana. I am a scientist (although not a geologist), so I was looking for something with plenty of detail.This book has plenty of good information, but it is written entirely for non-scientists. The terms used are pretty common ones. I would highly recommend this book for the average tourist who wants to learn more about the development of the region, since it is great to have more people informed.However, if you understand details concerning types of rocks, chemical compounds, structures of organisms, atmospheric compositions, etcetera that contribute to these gradual changes and formations, you should look for a different book. I am now enjoying Northwest Exposures: A Geologic Story of the Northwest, by Alt and Hyndman. It has far more gritty detail."
1,Looks Good -- Hard to Start -- Runs Poor,"I purchased this Edger Because of the TROY-BILT name. I was mistaken. This edger looks great but it ends there. This Troy-Bilt edger/trencher is hard to start, lacks power even though it is rated at 4.5HP and runs rough. If I could do this over, this Troy-Bilt would not be my choice for my edger."
1,hard (almost impossible) to start,"This edger has been hard to start since I got it, and now after 18 months is almsot impossible to start. I'm now looking for a different one."
1,YUK,"I do not know if this is the troy garden tiller I have or not. But... my husband bought me a Troy and it was: hard to start, loud, jerky. I really hated it."
2,Not as happy as I wanted to be,"For our inaugural attempt at baking with almond meal, we used our old standby scone recipe, which results in 8 delicious but massively carby scones, light and fluffy.Substituting almond meal 1:1 (which was a total guess because there were no instructions on the bag about how to substitute) for the flour, we ended up with a very runny-ish dough. I know it won't get as dough-like as wheat flour, but this was almost like cooked oatmeal, it was so runny. So we ended up doubling the amount of flour, therefore, 2:1 ratio to regular flour, and the scones came out (a) crumbly and (b) salty. I did add the regular amount of sugar to my recipe but it was apparently not enough to counteract the saltiness of the almonds. Each of us choked down one scone with a lot of milk, and five more were tossed in the back yard for the birds.We will next attempt to make oatmeal-raisin cookies with it, and if that's as bad a fail, then we will not even bother with this product again."
1,overpriced,why pay $36 here when you can get the same thing directly at the Honeyville site for $28?
5,Cookies,"I made cookies with this product , and they were awesome!! I gave some cookies for my friends to try and they also loved them! Can't wait to try other recapies with this."
5,Great Product,"I purchased this when a family member was having severe diabetes complications for the lower carbs. Now that isn't such an issue, I don't use this as frequently, so I keep it in the freezer. I believe either another user or product review suggest you allow time for thawing prior to use, which is great advice. I like the consistency and flavor of this and use it when constructing 'heavier' breads such as banana breads, or even pie dough."
5,good stuff,I made some fabulous muffins with this....cookies next. I will be buying this again! So nice to have gf options.
5,do it myself and save,I buy blanched almonds in bulk at Winco supermarket and grind them into flour with my food processor. big savings.
2,meal not fine flour,"I had gotten this before and remembered it being finer. This last bag threw off all my recipes. Only use it for muffins and breads.When you purchase directly from them during one of their promotions, it can take up to a week for them to even ship it."
1,quality good but NOT almond FLOUR,"the quality is good but since it has the skins on it, it is almond meal, and when baking you want almond flour, blanced almonds without the skins ground in as well!"
5,LOVE THIS PRODUCT,It has completely reeducated me allowing me to use this instead of wheat flours to do my favorite baking. I feel content finding what a wonderful product this is and don't feel deprived at all. It's terrific and I am a life long customer now.
5,Low Carb way to go!,"I have used this product for the past month for my Gluten Free, sugar free, soy free, dairy free eating habbits.I absolutely love eating this and the delicious baked goods from pizza crusts to chip cookies and breads. Recipes from the spunky coconut and elana's pantry will help you get started and keep U fullfilled!Eating Almond based leaves you so satified and full. The GF diet tends to be very starchy/high carb diet. I realized the ""hang-over"" from, firstly, the sugar and high carbs were making me feel ill & sleepy after eating.ONE DAY is the difference! No bloating, no belly/digestive discomfort.It is so nice to be able to get this from Amazon! However, Honeyville is the best price at 29.99 with 4.49 shipping. Purchase the 25lb bg. for the best price/lb.[...][...][...]"
3,overpriced,I purchased this flour to use with Elana's pantry gluten free recipes. Then I went on Honeyvilles website and found it for $26.00 I paid over $40 including shipping on Amazon.
2,Why $11 increase??,"This is the best almond flour I have ever used. I have been buying this product for 6 months now, usually buy one every month. When I came onto Amazon in December, it was sold out for about a month! I come back in January, and I see its back in stock!! However, my excitement came to an end when I saw that it now costs 43.99! Last time I purchased this on Amazon(and the times before) it cost 29.99 with free shipping. I would like to know why Amazon is now charging 43.99? I can go to Honeyville's website and get it for 31.99 with 4.49 shipping, which ends up being cheaper. If you want to save money, buy this on Honeyville's website!"
3,Price hike much??,"This flour is good, but I purchased it in July for $29.99. Now it's $40 for the same 5lb. bag? Ridiculous!"
5,Great little gadget...Get it if you can,"This may not be the most practicle PS itme to get, but it sure is fun. I own 3 of them. I moved to japan and found a TON of games that will work with this little marvel. anything from dating sims to sports games, to adventure games, this little baby will work. And you get to play the games you save. I got mine at a used video game store, so they were worth it. i am actully looking to get 2 or so more. If you can get one of these babys, i say go for it. dont listen to the nay sayers on this one, find a pocketstation and have fun."
1,Don't waste your time!,"Everyone I know wants to get their hands on a Pocketstation these days. Don't join thier ranks. I recently aquired one, and passed it on to someone I don't like very much. This is a COMPLETE WASTE, and if you think otherwise, I will kindly ask you to go buy some brain cells instead- they will last you longer. To spend money on a basic memory card with some buttons and a teeny tiny screen is dumb."
4,Excellant Analysis,"This is an excellant comparision of Common Text variants. It tends to rate some variants at an higher level than some scholars are comfortable with, but at the very least this serves as an excellant analysis of the possibile readings and the probablity of each."
4,Textual criticism,"A very readable commentary on the variant readings of the New Testament, written by a famous scholar."
5,A Must for those using UBS4,"Again, scholars are indebted to the work of Dr. Metzger. This work stands as a must for those working with the UBS4 or the NA27. Metzger gives explaination for the ratings of readings in many of the difficult texts and why they were rated as such. Concise, lucid and clearly written."
3,Of course you need to know Greek!,"Why on earth would someone participate in the discussion of textual criticism if you cannot read the language that's being discussed? This has a lot of information in it, however, some of the information seems to be biased toward a certain text type. If you want to read some of the ""other side"" regarding this issue, go check out some books by John William Burgon (Revision Revised, etc.)"
1,What a deception!,"I bought this book from Amazon with great expectations. However, considering that: 1. It is a second ""revised"" edition. 2. It is, so to speak directly, about the incompetence of some New Testament copyists throughout two millemnia. I can not help but state that it is a shame the noticeable THIRTY THREE PAGES MISSING! Actually, it makes for 5% of the book ""maimed"", since it stops at page 192 e suddenly continues from page 225. I think it appropriate to say that there is no sign of the pages being afterwards taken out, of course. Shame on the editors (United Bible Societes? Deutsche Biblegesellschaft? I don't know which of them, or if it was someone else.) What a lack of competence!"
1,I wish to correct Kindle e-book,I bought an e-book.But It is not about John but Mark.Cover is John but Contents is Mark's commentary.I wish you make a correct soon.
3,great little diaper storage.,"This is a cute little pouch to put your diapers in. I wish it were a little bigger, now that baby is in size 4 I can fit two diapers a thin wipe container and small tube of diaper cream. I love california baby diaper cream but it is to big for this pouch with the diapers and wipes. I think i would like it better if it were just a tad bigger. however I love that it keeps diapers in the diaper bag clean and free of baby crubms and you name it. It is high quality and made well."
2,"Lyrics are okay, music is slow.","My daughter loves Laurie Berkner, and based on the previous reviews, I thought this would be a good CD for her. This CD is definitely not in the same class. The lyrics have a lot of potential but most are dragged down by slow, unmotivating music. My daughter (16 months) barely registers that it is on, whereas she usually dances around the room and sings. Maybe this is more attractive for older children, but my recommendation is buy Laurie Berkner."
1,Totally groovy but not at all cool,"I bought this CD based on the many glowing reviews but was sorely disappointed. My 3 year old daughter thinks it's OK but it's not one of her favorites. To me it sounds something like a cross between elevator muzak and a lounge act at a very unhip island resort. Or maybe a kindergarten teacher on tranquilizers. The actual music sounds more geared to 40-50 year olds to me than to young children. If you want to have the mellow, grooooovy lite sounds as your background music and can manage to tune out the ridiculous lyrics about shaking your bum or belching like a gassy goose, not to mention the occasional weird sound effects, then by all means, buy it. (...)"
4,A Fresh New Voice,"Gelsanliter's distinctive bluesy, folky, rockabilly voice is unlike anything we've heard in children's music--her lyrics at times joyous, poignant, hilarious, or sad. Look for more hits from this talented young mother."
4,A fairly lenghty movie that you can't walk away from.,This movie was done by the BBC and includes many actors with strong accents. I watched this movie in one sitting because I had to find out how it ended. Like any other movie this one has some portions that lack credibility. The ending will really throw you for a loop.
3,"Worth watching, thanks to Phyllis Logan (Mrs. Hughes on Downton Abbey)","Fans of Phyllis Logan, who plays Mrs. Hughes on Downton Abbey, will enjoy seeing her in this show. She plays the often tough, but ultimately heroic Squadron Leader Helen Knox. The story has a few puzzling twists, and there's way too much military trigger-happiness. The sets have that ""BBC Drama"" familiarity, yet they somehow seem out-of-place for this story. Nonetheless, if you like Phyllis Logan and/or Downton Abbey, then this show is definitely worth watching!"
5,Enjoyed this series,I really liked this series. I like that fact that it had an ending and didn't just leave you hanging like so many series that plan another season but then don't do it. It wasn't the best I've ever seen but I did like it.
4,Nice idea,"I enjoyed this too-brief British series for presenting the idea of an alien threat that seemed, after repeated attempts at examination by the central characters, simply too overwhelming--while the warnings of a far-flung alien visitor are mostly dismissed. A key fact central to the whole endgame involving one character is never explicitly stated and you have to come to the realization she does herself on your own. The ultimate solution isn't one really--just the best available. This is sort of a dark, unhappy Dr. Who episode."
4,Good solid S-F drama,"* SPOILER ALERT* If you're looking for an action-packed, shoot 'em up flick, keep going. This is serious drama. The budget didn't allow for all the gee-whiz special effects, so all the intensity is in the story. I'm sure you've read all the plot summaries, so I won't repeat them. I just want to salute writers that have the guts to write a bad ending. I absolutely loved it."
2,kept waiting for it to get better,"The story had some good elements and the acting, mostly, was OK. However, I found the show rather dull to watch. I think I would say the directing lacked any ability to engage the audience or to excite the actors. Some later episodes had rather painful dialogue as well, with just bad directing. The CGI was fairly good, though, and the cinematography had some good moments.I guess I got my $15 worth in 6 hours of mildly amusing entertainment. I would only recommend to direhard SF fans, though. I'll likely not watch again as I usually do with SF shows, at least for many years."
3,An OK British Sci-Fi Movie,"I watched this movie. It had some good scenes in it, but they could have done better in the Sci-fi department. There wasn't enough ""Alien"" or ""Outer Space"" scenes. It also had an unconventional ending, which I didn't like. Also, the movie was 4 1/2 hours long. They could have put the whole movie on one VHS tape, at a slower speed, instead of putting it on three individual tapes. (Kept having to get up to change the tape) Otherwise, I'd say it was an alright movie, for the British."
3,could have been better....still good for a viewing,"I love invasion films...saw most and this one rates pretty good.The story is solid and the acting pretty good, but like any TV science fiction...there seem to be missing a few millions dollars ontheir production. Instead of a large scale movie we end up with a small scale movie that has not enough people in it...too much ofsome actors/actresses and that sleepy moog synthesizer music for allthe mushy scenes(too many...we dont care).I still bought the movie as there is not enough good alien invasionmovies out there and this is is worth a visit."
1,This needs to be reviewed on How Did This Get Made,"Wow, the cast is pretty good, but the acting, dialogue, editing and direction are horrible. Seriously, Paul and the gang of HDTGM need to do a podcast on this show."
1,Cure for Insomnia,"This was the great British hope for a stunning new SF show. Instead they came up with something only marginally better than wallpaper. Poor characterisation, awful dialogue, poor plotting, highly derivative scenes (one a blatant rip-off, even down to the dialogue, from the Star Trek episode ""The Immunity Syndrome""), and virtually no pace whatsoever, the only thing worse than this is Sliders. The whole things comes across as hastily written with no time spent on telling a good story and telling it well. Instead, I get the impression of someone rolling up his sleeves and saying ""Let's show the Americans that we can make big budget SF too"". If only they had spent as much time working on the script."
3,ehh...,"This is definitely not the best recording of this work. First of all, the bass is pushed way too high; It feels like the work was recorded in a giant cathedral, rather than the intimate setting one expects for chamberworks. The actual performance is not bad, but it isn't great either - the lento of the ""American"" isn't slow enough and lacks the necessary level of emotion, and the finale is taken way too fast. In my opinion, this recording suffers as a result, as the pacing just seems to be off. If you are looking for another option for #12, I would suggest either the Prague String Quartet on DG or the Talich Quartet on Calliope (which is part of a set that includes the Piano Quintet, String Quintet op. 97 and Quartets 11 - 14). Another fine performance is that of the Amadeus Quartet on DG Originals - it's an older recording but it sounds great, with the added bonus being that it's a double-disc which also includes all of Brahms' quartets at the same price you'd pay for 1 disc."
1,"absurd, silly, ridiculous, bogus, balony, BS, etc.","The pricing, dimensions, and weight make absolutely no sense. The seller is paying no attention to his business, and buyers should look elsewhere."
2,Muddy Sound. Buy a better version,"The sound is muddy, not crisp. Just got this, and I'll donate it to Friends of the Carpenter, who will sell it for about the fifty cents it is worth"
3,Surprising lack of depth........,"I am somewhat dismayed at the reviews of this disc. I found both perf's hurried and therefore lacking any insight. Why? I watched Gutierrez perform the 3rd on the PBS series Previn and the Pittsburgh and that was by all accounts for me, the best ""Rach3"" I've heard. I had also heard that Maazel and Gutierrez weren't exactly hitting it off too well when they were preparing this piece for the Pittsburgh public. This Rach 3 just wasn't what I expected.As far as the 2nd goes, Gutierrez and the Pgh orchestra do fine, but this too is a rushed and hasty affair, no matter how few to no mistakes there are. One would do better with Jeno Jando's 2nd on NAXOS."
2,these do not stay on your ears,"the sounds on these headphones is tight, but the open-air design lets other noise in, and also lets everyone around you hear what you're listening too. the biggest problem w/ these is that they do not stay put on your ear. you cannot go work out w/ them or even move around too quickly w/o having to readjust them. i would reccommend passing on these and checking out some of the other headphones sony is making."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this headphone to use when running outdoors. The sound is great but as another reviewer mentioned, this thing rarely stays put in my ears. Its as if my ears are too small.I called SONY to try to get a refund or exchange but there was nothing they could offer me. I will try to place it on sale in the amazon marketplace. I need to get it off my hands."
1,Horrible Headphones,"These are the worst headphones I have ever bought. Sony has done it again, too expensive and very awkward to wear. Do not waste your hard earned money on them."
1,Decent Bass and Not Much Else...,"I bought these to use with my Muvo TX while walking and biking. The bass is good, but the midrange and highs sound flat and dull. They also don't fit to the ear very well. Somewhat heavy on the ear. I will stick with the earbuds that came with mp3 player since they sound much better than the Sonys do. Very dissapointed."
2,"Uncomfortable, mediocre quality","When somebody buys clip-on headphones, it's normally because they will go jogging or they're working, so in-ear earplugs would fall out and/or feel uncomfortable and normal headphones are too bulgy. So they get clip-on headphones. DON'T GET THESE! Might as well get a stereo headset =/I've heard worse sound quality from other clip-on headphones, but it's still pretty bad. I can play my music on my phone without earphones and it sounds better. With my phone in my jacket.They're not designed to really clip either. The tiniest pull of the cord and they come off. If you go jogging they are guaranteed to fall off. If you're just sitting down listening to music, you will have to manually push them closer to your head or it sounds like a poor recording of a poor recording."
2,Pinches Ears,"Solid speaker drivers, however the fit is uncomfortable and tends to pinch ear after wearing for any extended period of time."
2,Tangle Free Cord is BS,The cord gets just as tangled as any other set of headphones. Worse the cord is slippery enough that my gear ties can't get a decent grip.The base is good though.
1,what is the use of headphones if the plug is horribly made,"I got this headphones, the cord that runs from one to another and to the laptop is very short and does not reach the laptop. So there is an extention cord enclosed. The problem is that the extention cord has a very loose connection with the main cord. You have to be immobile all the time, to the point of holding your breath not to disconnect the cords. Good luck with the item. I could not return it, b/c the sellers stocking fee was high, and he included part of the price in shipping."
3,There are Better headphones,i got this as an addition to my creative nomad jukebox zen NX xtra 30 GB Mp3 player.i got to say this...build quality rocks an they look cool...but these headphones hurt my ear so bad even though my ears not big nor are they small...unless i keep the headphones close to my ear the sound quality seems to suffer.i would rather recommend a over the ear headphones.
2,disappointment,"i ordered these because i had read some reviews that claimed they produced high quality sound for this style of headphone. the price was ok, the order process was smooth and they arrived on time. unfortunately, i really dislike their sound and don't use them. only the manufacturer and the reviewers are to blame."
1,Do not waste your money.,"Don't buy. The headphones do not stay on your ears (unless you press and hold with your fingers). Audio quality is average, but does it matter when the headphones keep coming off. Since it is not properly place in your ear, the sound WILL leak externally and allows other sounds to enter (these headphones are the complete opposite of noise reduction headphones). Only use if you are in a state of Zero motion (which in physics is impossible). Bottom line uncomfortable and inconvenient headphones equals useless headphones."
2,good product poor quality,"The spray commander was recommended by a trainer I hired. My dog sometimes had anxious behavior and got too excited around certain people. The trainer's collar worked great, so I bought one and they're pretty expensive. Out of the box the sprayer would not work but the sound did. He actually responded to the sound, and I was ready to send the collar back when the sprayer started working. It's such a great tool, but the trainer said they only work about 50% of the time, so be prepared."
2,Ok at first...,"When I first got the Spray Commander, I was psyched. Finally, something that would help train my beagle-boxer mixed, six-month old puppy. It was great! She would bark...I would spray her and it would stop. She would jump up on people, I would spray her. Eventually, all I would have to do it press the beeper on it and she would hear it and knock it off. Well, all of a sudden, the long spray button stopped spraying long sprays. It started to spray short ones. Ok I guess, because I never really used that button anyway. Then, the short spray button spray got A LOT shorter. The collar started losing its effectiveness. Now both sprays are super short. I am a little disappointed. I ended up just taking the collar off because it is pointless now. Wish that I would have know that it was going to crap out on me within the first month...I would have purchased something else."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Purchased this unit a few months ago, worked once and then never again. Exchanged for a second unit, which also worked once and then never again. Will be returning for a refund."
2,Unreliable product,"I am now on the second device and it broke on me again. The remote control stopped working all of a sudden. I replaced the batteries and made sure that the unit was refilled properly.I dealt with the manufacturer directly rather than going through the vendor. Multivet which was based in Canada agreed to send me a new device after a long email correspondences. But before I received a new unit the company was bought by Petsafe and they dropped the ball. Petsafe was kind enough to believe me without proof and send me a new training unit. But after a week that broke too. Now I have to send back the unit at my cost and wait for another unit to arrive. God only knows how long the next one will last.This device is effective but I believe it is too fragile. Mine never got wet or suffered any rough abuse. It's not worth this high price, in my opinion."
4,Kenny Werner's DVD on mastery,"This DVD offers a rare opportunity to listen to the sublime jazz artist, Kenny Werner, share his process for connecting to his creative source. Anyone who aspires to be more fully open to his/her own creative spirit should be fascinated, as I was."
3,Very Christian,Be aware that over 50% of the comprehension and analysis questions directly relate to chapter and verse of the Christian Bible. The remaining questions require closed-ended answers from the text of The Hobbit.
2,"Stick with ""The Plege""","The American version of this film is infinitely better. And not just because it has an all-star cast and a newly competent Sean Penn. He redeems himself for the reprehensible ""Indian Runner"" and ""Crossing Guard."" No, while those are good and valid reasons to see the American film they are not the most compelling. The most compelling reasons to steer clear of this film are these: 1) It is the only film I've seen that contains a scene where two grown men play patty cake in their underwear. (No this is not a obscere euphemism it is literally what happens. 2) It is the only movie I've seen where a psychopath shaves his genitals on camera. 3. It doesn't have the same ending as the American film. (I currently have the novel on order from Amazon but I don't know how it ends.) If you liked the Pledge as much as I did you probably won't heed my warning, so the best piece of advice I can give you is this: it is available new from a few websites...."
5,"So interesting and unusual! I loved the ""color"" and ""life""",This book is one I'd definately have to recommend. It was so interesting and it kept me reading for more. I never realized how much LaBastille did!
3,markings,"the description had said there was no writing or marking in the book, and there was marking in two different chapters, which was kind of frustrating because it is a devotional book in which you have to fill in answers to different questions, so I had to cross out the previous answers. other than that though, the book is great."
1,Do It Yourself MST3K,"This movie is bad. Spectacularly bad. Magnificently bad. Which means it is a perfect movie to watch with friends and make wisecracks the whole time. I had a hunch it would be like this from the title and the bad grammar in the description. I was not let down. What is this movie about? A lesson that prostitution is a bad career choice? No, the hooker is hardly in the movie at all. That religion can save you. Without spoiling anything, let me just answer ""no"". That family is important. No, this family is pretty messed up. I don't know what it's about AT ALL. The acting is bad (though Grandma was done well--Grandpa was an astronaut in ""Planet of the Apes""!), the filmmaking and editing are a joke, the music is very seventies. Honestly, the only reason to watch it is to laugh at it. We had a good time doing that."
1,Hooker. Really ?,"Whether it had been a Black or White Person , it would not have really mattered.This movie is a Real Bummer. Totally Like a Story-less , Plot-less C-Grade Movie. I cannot Fathom What The Director,Producer, etc were thinking of when they made this. Beats me !!"
3,"Entertaining, though brief, look at Seal pup's life","Reason for Reading: I am reading Richard Sobol's entire backlist with my son and discussing the life of a photographer/photojournalist as a career option while doing so. This is the final book for us to read.A short read with lots of illustrations. The author brought his son with him on this assignment and the story is told through both of their points of view. The reader is generally shown the complete life of a seal pup from birth until it is abandoned by it's mother. Then it describes at this point how it will take the cub a couple more years until he is ready to join in the mating ritual and complete the life cycle again. There is only scant page time spent on the controversial hunting practices and no photographs of this are shown. They stick to the beauty of the animal. An entertaining, if brief, account of an animal's way of life"
4,Rethinking how modern science is done,"In THE DIALECTICAL BIOLOGIST, Levins and Lewontin take a Marxist dialectical approach to examine the way and shape of contemporary biology. Not that I fully understand this approach, it does raise some intriguing critiques about the influence of the biotech-industrial complex and how groupthink and intertia of academia enforces dogma. I particularly liked the ""Isadore Nabi"" piece and the essay on agri-business.As a working scientist, I think it is important to think and rethink the Big Picture of why and how we do what we do. THE DIALECTICAL BIOLOGIST addresses a few particular questions of ways of modern biology.NB: similar themes are covered in DOING SCIENCE: THE REALITY CLUB #2, edited by John Brockman."
3,Worked great for two weeks untill car cassette adapter quit.,Worked great for two weeks untill car cassette adapter quit working. Just after starting out on a long car trip the cassette adapter kept ejecting on its own after about one second of play. I bought it for this trip and it was not good company! I got it exchanged for an AIWA XP-V706C. I will report on this after a month or so.
1,"Broke, Broke, Broke",I noticed that this happened to a few others... After one car ride the cassette adapter broke--kept ejecting incessantly--utterly annoying. I'm sure it's a decent player if I could ever hear it. Definitely not worth your hassle.
4,best I've read by James herbert,"I recently started to read James Herbert novels. I have read The Fog, Magic Cottage, Portent, and now, the Dark. This is a great book. It is pretty creepy in parts, but overall it is well written and a joy to read. I read it in three sittings, and it isn't exactly a short book...check this one out, if you are a longtime fan, or just beginning to read his works..."
5,Read it,"Read all his books and really like his style and writing, so pick them up if you get the chance"
5,ok well that was creepy as Hell,"Well Damn, where do I even begin?!? This Author was recommended to me by another Fabulous Author Mr. Tim O'Rourke & I owe him a huge thank you for that!! This book was non-stop chills, thrills & action with more than one moment of just pure terror right from the start. I was gripping my Kindle wanting desperately to read on but afraid to at the same time, scared of what was to come. It was horrific bliss & I loved to fear every second of it!! I never saw the end coming!!! I look foward to reading much more from this Author & fully intend to invest in some Damn good nitelights Lol Peaceful sleep is but a dream tonight, this one will stick with me for awhile *shivers*"
5,Sassy and Swinging Bassist,"Sassy and swinging bassist and vocalist has just released her second recording. This is one you must have. Kristin is among the very few jazz artists that can play and sing at the same time.(how does one do it?) And her trio is magnificent. Drummer Jeff Hamilton and former Ella Fitzgerald pianist Mike Wofford round out this dynamite trio. The song selection is superb and the whole recording just glows. This young woman, who is the new director of Jazz Studies at Eastern Washington University, is a definate star on the rise. Great tunes, beautiful arrangements, and a fine project all around. Congratulations Ms. Korb."
3,Sega saturn,"Sega saturn is an older console my parents ordered on the internet. when i got it it worked without ant problems and still does. It has average graphics and controls but has good games like tomb raider, virtua cop, soul calibur and doom being some of my favourites.If you can find one, buy this console!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"sega saturn... thanks, but not really","heres my review, i was excited to recieve the saturn i had one when i was younger, but when i received it it turns out it doesnt even work i basically paid for a doorstop, or a paper weight. thanks for that! i wish i knew a long time ago i could make money off my old broken stuff."
3,missing pieces,"When I received my sega saturn i was distrought to find that the plug in and cable were missing. However, because i didn't know a details page existed and that the writer stated on the details page that several pieces were missing, i have no one to blame but myself. To put this into perspective, a sega saturn video game system that has no plug wire is only half a video game system. I still have yet to test the system because I have to find the fitting pieces to get it to work. I did receive it on time."
1,This is a joke right?,"The system is really bad. That is why I think that it left the market the day after it was made practically. It has some advantages but at the current price tag of ... it isn't worth it. So yourself a favor and wait for the new console by Nintendo, Game Cube, to come out. Do not buy the Sega Saturn."
3,Interesting console,"The Sega Saturn could have easily beaten the Playstation if Sega had spent more time on it. The graphics are equilvant, if not better, and the idea for a 3D controller was neat. The problem with this system is GAMES! Nights into dreams, a port of 3D Blast, and a few others. They didn't even make a full Sonic game on it. Sonic 3D Blast and Sonic R don't count. They were developing a 3D Sonic game called Sonic Xtreme, but it was a disaster. It had already been moved from Genesis to 32X, and then the Saturn. The directors of the game were being switched constantly, the final one almost died from stress. At one point Xtreme was using the Nights Into Dreams 3D engine, but then they got in trouble for it and had to start from scratch. So Sega made a console and never had an actual Sonic game on it. Pure sadness. I recommend the console because some games are not that bad, but I wouldn't want to spend more then $70 on it."
1,The lamp died precociously.,"I was a big fan of this scanner until recently.It scans books fast without damaging spines.I used it very carefully.I used another scanner of mine for non-book materials, because I didn't want to waste the lamp life.The result? The lamp died after around 200 scans!I used it intermittently, so I was out of warranty when the lamp died.I've used scanners of several manufacturers, and this is the first time that a scanner lamp died on me.In sum, $300 for 200 scans is not recommendable at all.Added: I got another reason to hate this scanner. Service of the company is horrible. I sent several emails about my problem, but never got answers."
2,Ouch!,"I bought one of these a year ago and it worked well until it started developing streaks. Then I bought this one - yuck! - first off, the light wouldn't come all the way on - so I voided the warranty, opened it up, and pushed the connection back onto the bulb - works for a few days until I have to do it again. Occasionally, the scan won't include the first inch or so of the glass until I unplug the scanner and plug it back in.I have books I've collected over the last 30 years, I'd like to scan before downsizing my home for retirement - this seems ideal - and is still the best solution, but the workmanship is shoddy."
3,Inappropriate style of performance for the piece.,"The Mackerras version of Gilbert and Sullivan's Mikado does have talented performers, just as some other reviewers have stated. However, an analysis of just one song will show what is wrong with this version. In the song ""Three little maids from school are we,"" it is sung as if it were a serious piece of music, rather than a delightful comedy. The singers are obviously not ""Filled to the brim with girlish glee,"" or even womanly glee, which brings us to the other major flaw. Do you remember how Hollywood used to have actresses who were 35 or so play the parts of teenage girls? Do you remember how unbelievable it is? The same is true here. The women singing the parts of the three girls are obviously too old for the parts. If you want a delightful piece of music performed in a stodgy and inappropriate way, this is for you. Otherwise, I would look elsewhere (I am still looking myself)."
5,"A great gift book, full of wonderful photography and stories","Football America has a lot of terrific football photography featuring college, pro, pee-wee, high school and even prison football shots. Also, the stories are interesting and fun. Overall, it's a nice presentation that would appeal to all different kinds of sports fans"
5,A deep dive into a specific time and place,"This book is excellently researched and assembled and provides real insights into Boston society of the period. Struggles between orthodoxy and liberalism and between the elite and the common person have parallels in our country today. My learning from this book, however, came only after a second reading three years after the first reading. The first time through I did not have the background or context to make the best use of the material. In other words, this book is not for newcomers to the questions of freedom of religion or social history in the post-revolutionary period. If you have a solid background in either area then you will find this book a valuable addition to your library. If you want to focus on Boston history with the help of a truly a scholarly work, then it's a must-have."
3,Useful Detail on New Mexico's Tragic National Guardsmen,"This book is most useful to researchers who are knowledgeable regarding the early Pacific War period and the US role in defense of the Philippines in 1941-1942. Without that background, the reader must work through a loosely organized compendium of facts and figures that may seem a bit disjointed and removed from the ""big picture"" of what really happened at Bataan and Corregidor in early 1942. For the researcher, the book is much more valuable, as the author has been diligent in unearthing hard to find statistics from multiple sources.Good book for the military historian interested in the defense and fall of the US Pacific outposts, and the fate of early prisoners of the Japanese"
5,A MUST READ -Fun loving and passionate!,"I loved this book. I definately would recommend reading this story about Elaina and Ren Daniels. The story takes place 9 years later when Ren is out for revenge and in the middle of this, he ends up running into the very woman he was grateful to. The story goes on from there. I had fun reading this because throughout the book, Kat keeps you wondering about what happened 9 years ago and how Elaina was a part of Ren's past. It's nice to read a book and have so many emotions,including passion, about it. I think Kat does a great job with that! Thanks Kat."
3,Big Ears Need Not Apply,"I had been looking to upgrade the average headphones that come with most MP3 players and Walkman so I saw the ""Deep-Bass Turbo"" marketing claim for these headphones and purchased a pair. They clip over the ears and simply fit poorly on my ears. OK, my ears are a little on the large side. The sound is OK but I have to push them to my head with my hands to get a good acoustical fit. My wife thinks they are OK but she has ""mouse ears"". However, don't tell her I said that. The wiring is sheathed in some sort of woven material which should hold up well. I have since purchased a pair of Koss SportaPros through Amazon and would highly recommend them over these phones. The SportaPros really produce the low bass and smooth high end I was looking for."
3,Overpriced.....,i got this as an addition to my creative nomad jukebox zen NX xtra 30 GB Mp3 player.i got to say this...build quality rocks an they look cool...but these headphones hurt my ear so bad even though my ears not big nor are they small...unless i keep the headphones close to my ear the sound quality seems to suffer.i would rather recommend a over the ear headphones.
5,whatever hapened to Gary Clark,"Echoing the other reviews, this Cd holds a place in my top 50, a unique sound and paying homage to so many references.This cd is worth it alone for the classic single second summer and the wonderful ballad of me and shirley maclaine.I purchased a Cd in 1995 by a band called King L, produced and lead vocals Gary Clark, another classic, unable to find it on Amazon."
3,Okay,"okay product but overpriced. the item's image and description is misleading.the design on the rug is nothing like what's shown here. but the design is not bad. ok, really. the size is accurate."
1,rug nightmare,We ordered the rug pictured however we received a junk product that doesn't even closely resemble the rug in the picture. When we tried to return or exchange we received an email that it takes some kind of special consideration. This garbage is in the garage and I have not received item ordered .
2,Requires Internet to install,"The game requires an internet connection to connect to Steam in order to install the game, but this fact does not seem to be mentioned anywhere."
4,Great Fun...,"What do you get when you combine Resident Evil with Counterstrike? Left4Dead is mainly made for online play but does have a single player campaign to it, only drawback is there is no savegame feature to the single player aspect, you have to remember where you left off to start again from the main menu. It does run fine on a single core processor older computer, just make sure you have a decent video card. Just meet the minimum requirements and it will run fine, surprisingly as there is a lot happening on the screen. Overall a great action game with a Resident Evil feel to it, just can't understand the lack of a single player save system."
4,Zombiemania,"Left for Dead is a very interesting and entertaining game. It has both, a very eerie and suspenseful atmosphere. If you have ever wanted to be in a zombie movie or experience a zombie attack, this puts you right in the middle of the action. You feel like you are right there and you end up getting caught up in the simple, yet intriguing storyline. What makes it fun is the fact that online there are up to four playable good guy characters in co-op mode either human or artificial. Online, you can also play as a zombie attacking the good guys. There is a statistics scoring system for almost anything that you do to a zombie which is displayed after each level is completed. Don't play alone!"
4,great single player action,"Haven't tried the multiplayer yet - but the single player campaign delivers great zombie fragging entertainment. Great looking visuals, runs well on contemporary mid-range hardware. Great replayability."
2,Hate the Steam connection,"I've used Steam before. Maybe it is alright for playing online, but it is a royal pain in single player action and you are required to use it. And...don't lose your password to Steam because you will never get it back and the game is as good as worthless when that happens."
1,"Must download whole game, even with DVD","I'll never buy another Steam game, NEVER NEVER NEVER. It will simply not install from DVD on XP. According to the web it used to, but it no longer works and forces you to download the entire 6 gig game. Be prepared to wait for hours and hours for something you paid money for already (my download took 21 hours). To enter the activation key (the easy part), you must do it manually via Steam (the setup program just disappears after you specify English Language; leaving no hint of even this first step). What a horrible experience, even with a simple fast PC setup! I'LL NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER BUY A STEAM GAME AGAIN!!!!"
2,Flippin DRM,"I played the game once on 360, and yes, it is a blast.But, if you don't have high speed internet, you can't play. I've tried for nearly 18 hours to play it now but the closest I have been to is ""Preparing to launch"" and after it tries for a bit to load, it just won't load. Then Steam glitched, and when I uninstalled to reinstall, it now won't update again. I'm in Kuwait right now and the internet, at best, will download 35 Kilobytes/second, but it cuts out on an average of 4 times an hour, and since Steam won't pick up where you left off on downloading, any of us over here trying to play it on PC is pretty much screwed. I wasn't able to sign on to Steam in offline mode either.Just wanted to kill some zombies :)"
4,Left 4 Dead,"Left 4 Dead is a excellent game overall (4 1/2 out 5 stars). Single player campaign is excellent, but the multiplayer is what makes the game awesome. Only complaint about this game is only four campaigns and a limited amount of weapons and zombie types. Anyone that buys this game will have a blast. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys first person shooters."
1,BEWARE OF STEAM - DO NOT BUY FOR PC,"The only thing more horrifying than the zombies in the game is the STEAM co (Steam is an online service offered by Valve Corporation). They take Total control over the game itself and you cannot deal directly with the Valve co. They have no phone numbers (well, one Dead one)!!!! No one to contact but steam on line. I have found they will not help you with any problems. I wish I read the problems other people had Before I bought the game. This is a Real answer they sent me:""Hello M,A staff member has replied to your question.We will not be able to assist you with this issue.The thing is, I sent them the problem and THIS WAS THE RESPONSE. They will not answer any more !?!?Great game but Do Not Buy it for PC."
1,Don't Buy,"Valve promised new characters, new weapons, new campaigns, new achievements.... and then they decided to release L4D2. Admitted in an interview, they started working on L4D2 IMMEDIATELY after L4D (this game) was launched. The lobby system is still bugged, and we are still waiting for the SDK (to allow user-made content) even though they were promised a long time ago. STAY AWAY FROM VALVE. They lie about what they have in store for their products."
2,Mindless killing - Mindless buying.........,"I think this game is a over-hyped, been there-done-that kind of thing. Really, where's the strategy in all the mindless killing of zombies? Yeah, if you just want to shoot something over and over its fun but if you want more in the way of game content and innovation then look else where. Valve games are all over hyped with HL2 as the exception. I have been playing PC games for years and I can't believe so many fan boys here buy into it. There is so much more to PC gaming with Fallout 3 being a great example of a real game. My honest opinion about LFD is that it's nothing but a updated version of last years ""Hell Gate London"" but done better. Good Luck."
1,The Perfect Game for Zombie Fans,"My one star is merely for how long the installation and WAITto play the game took once I got it and not the actual game itself. I have a 512K Connection and it was the longest wait ever on a game installation.The only drawback I can see to this game is the lack of variety in weapons. The things like Molotov's, Gas Cans, Propane Tanks are VERY cool.The Gatlin guns are fun 2 although not quite as useful as you would imagine if the hordes happen to be comnig fro a direction the gun won't point 2 lolFor a horror movie fan like myself it's a great game. I'd say the hunting rifle is my personal favorite especially when zooming in and going for head shots it looks like something right out of the new Dawn of The Dead or Romero's Diary of The Dead. (the hospital level really reminds me of that movie). I would say if you enjoy PC shooter and horror movies or even just into Zombie Flicks or 28 Days Later then this IS the perfect game for you."
4,Best Multi player in years,I was VERY VERY impessed with STEAM and their ability to make this one of the most solid online gaming experiences ever. Valve also did a fantastic job of ensuring a high level of random sponing each time you load the game.With a game this good I wish the character selection and weapon options would have been more diverse. And 4 chapter simply isn't nearly enough game play. Other than that I am VERY VERY happy with my purchase.
5,well worth the money!,"As with any VALVe game, Left 4 Dead is intense, fun, and well worth the money you will spend on it. I bought this game because of my love for VALVe games, since Half-Life all the way through The Orange Box I've been following VALVe for a long time, and they have never disappointed me!"
5,Great game at a great price!,"After a few years away from PC gaming, early reviews of Left 4 Dead looked very promising. Upon release, Amazon had it discounted in days and with fast order processing and shipment made the shopping experience a breeze!"
5,Kill a Zombie for Mombie,"The zombie apocalypse is upon us. After hours of playing the demo and now hours of playing the newly released game, I feel like there is no hope for mankind."
3,fun but not much variety,"I was pretty excited about L4D because i generally like to play co-op games. After reading all the rave reviews, i happily plunked down $40 for the game. After several gaming sessions with friends both lan and over internet, i concur with others that the game is a blast to play (with friends, not so much solo), but i felt that there wasn't much variety after a while.i like how the director changes things up every time you play the game, but after a while, it's basically the same thing over and over again, a bunch of zombie meat come running at you, peppered by encounters with boomers, smokers, hunters, tanks, and the witch. hopefully valve will generate new content or add some depth to the game mechanics."
4,Left for Dead - zombie fun,Valve does it again! Left 4 Dead puts you into a surival Zombie movie.Mutliplay allows you to become a bone muching Zombie - it does not get any better then that.
2,Not that bad!,"I got this after playing Fallout 3. Just wanted something else to do.There's no plot, you just kill zombies, lots of zombies, so many zombies!!!Dialogue is limited to ""reloading"" ""Ammo Here""Based on what it is, it's not that bad, you just really want to kill zombies. And not expect much else from the game. There's no looting except for weapons and ammo and med stuff. Pretty much the same thing over and over, but the game is short. Cant' believe this cost almost the same as Fallout 3."
2,Great for for 1/2 Day. Highly over rated.,"Yes it has great graphics and it runs well. We all love killing zombies & kill them you can.The problem & it is a huge one, is, there are only four small levels, few weapons, no upgrades and little objectives then kill zombies and receive pointless badge rewards. It is more like a game expansion then the real deal. The end result is many people will get bored fast playing this.This could have been so much more but somewhere the plot was left out! If it was sub $20 I would give it one more star.It requires steam (which I do not like as a concept) so you have to have internet to install and play. They will no doubt release extra levels on their Steam site & you will have to pay for each one, so some people will end up paying a huge about for what the game should have contained in its release. Avoid & spend your money on a more complete game."
3,"Talk about overhyped !! There's nothing here, repetitive and boring","Its a silly game, but we knew that. Yes, it is smooth as a multi player experience, and it does work. However, there is ZERO depth here, and for [...] bucks, a total and complete waste of money. $[...] is more like it for this dribble. Basically, nothing ever happens. You just run around and shoot zombies. Thats it. Nothing else.Valve is a class act, and their development prowess is second to none. This is an excellent technical executed game, but it is totally dumb and basically unfun most of the time.As far as a smooth, works all the time Co op, yep, it does do that. But thats it. Nothing else. The game IS a zombie"
3,a truly fun game....not much room for resale though,"as a shooter its a hoot and keeps you up and gunning, however, because of the tie in to STEAM, as a resale property its truly a hassle. this game ties itself to a steam account and if you decide to re-sell it the person who buys it will have to hassle with the support at steam to get the cd key reset(which is a real pain). On a brighter side and FYI, when you buy the game do not attach it to your primary steam account if you have one, instead create a separate account for this game only so if you decide to sell you can provide the buyer with the login info and they can create their own password for their own use.other than the steam thing its a hoot!"
3,pros & cons,"Here's my review:PROS:-Teamplay is a must! You absolutely can not win without playing with your team.-Graphics are amazing.-Gameplay is intense! Lots of adrenaline required.CONS:-You can only play with 8 people. 4 humans & 4 zombies-You cannot create a public lobby. The game creates one and just throws you into the first empty one. You can play with your friends, but you have to create a private friends only lobby.-Most people that you end up playing with are very immature and their vocabulary consists mainly of racial slurs. (you will hear nig@#, f@6, etc. many times)SUMMARY:-I think this game would be alot of fun if 8 of my friends had it, but the chances of that happening are probably slim. Still an amazing game though. I would recommend getting it."
3,Costs too much for too little,"The solo campaign is too short, the online play has too many exploits and too little variety. It is a fun game but not fun enough for the price. I would certainly buy it for $20, maybe for $30. If I had not gotten it as a gift I would have felt ripped off."
3,"Fun for a few days, then repetitive.","I only play this game with a few close friends that I have been gaming with since 1998. It was extremely fun for the first few days as you explore each campaign and slowly ramp up the difficulty. After finishing up the campaigns, there are several versus modes but they just aren't that much fun. All in all this is a decent purchase but if possible try renting it first."
2,boring!,"graphics are good and the concept was great! then you play the game and realize there is nothing scary or suspenseful about it. it's your basic run and gun. Unlike resident evil, where zombies may suprise you crasing through windows, this game just throws dozens of zombies around every corner. just keep shooting and moving forward and you will complete each map. nothing exciting about it. i pre-ordered it and GAVE the game away a week later."
3,Great multiplayer! Single Player not so much...,"First off, the graphics and sound are pretty awesome. The sound is probably the best sound for suspense that I have heard in a long time. The gameplay combined with the environment are great! In multi-player is where this game shines...and it doesn't just shine it fully combusts. Online play as the infected vs the survivors is my favorite. My only problem is that the single player game is incomplete. The single player game doesn't have a coherent story-line, in fact there is no story line. You can play anyone of the characters but it doesn't matter because each character is the same, no unique abilities or different abilities. Even with my issues with single player I will still play this game due to the fact that I think this is the best co-op/online/multi-player game out there since you have to truly work with your partners."
3,"Good game, but can get old quick","All around fun enjoyable shooter. However, the single player and campaign styles of play get old very quickly. The versus mode is good to keep interest in the game, however, with only two of the four campaigns to choose from versus mode gets tiresome as well."
