2,different turns to a similar end,"More feints, marches, countermarches. Meanwhile, Dr. Newt throws a bone to the the logic of manumission for the South as a means of increasing its ranks of cannon fodder. As a sop to ecumenism, the Rabbi of Baltimore is allowed the moral high ground and Lee is cast in the role of the pious gentleman (the greatest of southern myths).The excercise in alternate history is a peculiar one: there has to be a semblence of credibility in the plot line; otherwise, it's just random musings with no real consraints until the internal logic of history is abandoned. To its credit the story line re-anchors itself with the reality that the South was and would continue to be so disproportionately understrength in men and material that it could never fully exploit its battlefield victories"
4,"Great book, title a little misleading","I really enjoyed the book. It was well written and well researched. The only problem I had with the book is that, being most interested in Grant, I thought that this book was going to focus primarily on him and his preparations for taking over the army. Though the book does devote some pages to Grant's preparations, it mostly touches on Lee outside Washington and in Baltimore and on Sickles and the Army of the Potomac. Aside from the misleading title, the book was great."
3,Politics creeps in,"This book isn't nearly as good as Gettysburg. The first was good, fact-based speculative fiction. This, much less so. Knowing at least one of the writers' politics, I find it hard not to believe that that had something to do with Lincoln being portrayed as almost a saint, and the New York Democratic Party hack turned General, being portrayed as verging on the devil."
4,NOT A BAD SYSTEM,"I purchased my SC-AK44 as a replacement for a 11 year old 57 watt Pansonic Platinum CD/DUAL DECK/FM-AM boom box system that I used at my job.The unit is much larger so I had to re-adjust my shelf to fit it. It's bass response is light years ahead of my old boom box. My office has 10 foot ceilings and as wide as a seven car garage. This 300 watt system has no trouble filling up the office with powerful clear sound! So why only 4 stars? SLOOOWW & NOISY CD changer tray system plus you can't swap any CDs while one's playing,the tape deck has no high speed dubbing or Dolby Noise reduction; Other wise this is a great unit for my office and I'm happy with it."
2,Not Bright,"As usual, disappointed with solar lighting. Not bright, hard to see. Would not buy again if I were given the opportunity."
2,Great idea. Poor execution.,"Had high hopes for this item. Great concept, but poor execution. I had originally purchased 3 of these. They looked good in the water so I purchased 6 more. The solar charging/battery system would keep them lit several hours nightly. Within 2 weeks, a few stopped working. Upon examination, I found that the seal had failed and water had entered the lights. These were not dropped or abused, just floating in the pool. I checked them all and found several more with water intrusion. All were returned. Had they not leaked, I probably would have left a positive review."
5,Apache Pride,"Mr. Cuevas has done an absolutely great job in retelling these ancient stories of the Apache people. My grandmother (who was part Apache) also told me stories that she had heard when she was a child. Unfortunately, I do not remember the vivid details as the author does.As with most Native American knowledge, this information has been ignored in mainstream history books for way too long. Keep writing Mr. Cuevas. Great book!"
1,Don't waste your time.,"Surprise! They make stupid movies in French, too. This one was so bad I couldn't stand to finish it. It doesn't even have enough entertainment value to get you past its stupidity. AVOID!"
3,Une Piece,"This is France's equivalent of a stock comedy - decent but mechanical. There's one really amusing scene about 70% through the movie that is worth holding on for, but for the rest it's as predictable as any Hollywood product. Although I tend to favor European movies over their US counterparts, this is one film that could easily have been made on the West Coast. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the lack of chemistry between the two protagonists - although we all expect them to get together and the plot moves laboriously towards the inevitable conclusion, it's just not believable in any way when it finally happens. This is too much a movie-by-numbers and could have benefited from a more imaginative script."
3,Good dvd except Waynes World,These are all great movies I bought this for the Coneheads movie for my daughter. I decided to watch Waynes World and when I put it in the screen showed Philly PPV.I was in shock I eventually got it to play buy putting it in and contantly pushing the skip button on the player.
5,I bought this for Coneheads. AWESOME.,"NARFTLE THE GARTHOK!Beldar Conehead: An owner's manual to a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable.Highmaster: Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable?Beldar Conehead: A personal conveyance named after its inventor, an assassinated ruler, a character from Greco-Roman myth and a small furry mammal.Highmaster: Ah.Beldar Conehead: If I did not fear incarceration from human authority figures, I would terminate your life functions by applying sufficient pressure to your blunt skull so as to force its collapse!"
4,s.,"This is a surprisingly light read of a heavy topic that gives a unique, inside view of life with the artist, Jean-Michael Basquiat. It is an even better book when read as a success story of a woman who ultimately left an unhealthy relationship. Since it covers her childhood as well as her relationship with Basquiat and her attempts to move away from him you get a little bit of insight as to why she would be attracted to this type of person. When you finish the book you will have learned about the sensationalized artist but you will also learn a story about a very successful woman who wasn't quite as interesting to the public only because she was strong and overcame adversity instead of wallowing in it. She is probably not as famous as her ex-beau because she didn't die of an overdose, but such is our culture."
2,Gerber LMFII,"Just received the knife today and as always, right on time Amazon. It's an extremely solid knife and like everyone else said, heavy. Unfortunately I have to give it two stars because like several others after just a few times of putting it into the sheath I am noticing the grip peeling away from the blade. I'm sure it will hold up, but before long it will look like a mess. I will probably send it back since for this should certainly not happen after a few pulls from the sheath."
5,Awesome Knife!,"I love this combat knife! This has a very stout and sharp blade! I have this mounted to the rollbar in my Jeep and I use it all the time, very handy. And if I ever get ambushed by some zombies, I know I could quickly dispatch them with this badboy! Lol!"
4,"Of course it's great, it's a gerber!","I ordered the Lmf2 and as usual it was delivered faster than the estimated time given.This is a quality product and very useful tool. The blade was raZor sharp right out of the box, and remained sharp after several uses. The built in sharpener is definitely a nice touch as well. The sheath is heavy duty nylon and very sturdy. It comes with a thigh strap great for hunting and camping. The butt of the knife is an excellent tool. It can be uses to hammer, energy windown break. The blade is heavy duty and thick. The knife itself has a nice weight to it and great grip. I would suggest this knife to any outdoorsman."
5,LMF II,"I LOVE this knife. although, someone else loved it to and it was stolen. Oh well. I ordered another because I loved it so much. If this one gets stolen or damaged, I will definitely buy a replacement!! Shipping was very fast also"
4,Good knife,"Love the sharpener in the sheath and partially serated blade, but I don't love how the sheath doesn't have any clips or loops to attach to a belt! I had to rig my sheath up with some paracord to make loops for my belt to pass through. That is why I gave this product 4 stars and not 5.Other items to note: mine came with what appears to be a leg holster type of thing to wrap around your calf, and this knife is fairly heavy and feels quite solid."
4,Good but not for everyone,"This is a great knife. Sharp, Sturdy, and Useful. However it is heavy and bulky, not to mention hard to remove from the sheath."
3,gerber 22-01529 lmf ii blk 4.8 knive,"the knife is good but the finish on the blade came off with some oil and a little rubbing. don't like the sheath as very hard to draw knife out. for the time being will keep using my old cold steel(made in usa) knife. after over 20 years of hunting and fishing in the marshes and swamp lands of south louisiana the finish isstill on blade, sharpens good, and can pull knife out of sheath fast."
2,Lack of quality control,"Knife seems to be ok but mine has a blade that has a curve to it. It will function but when you hold it in your hand and look down the spine it's very noticeable. I would think the final inspector would have seen this before it went out the door. I would exchange it but I was away when it arrived and missed the dead line for returns. This has nothing to do with Amazon, my complaint is with Gerber. American made should be a good thing, but with this knife, it has no meaning."
4,great knife,"The main reason I bought this knife is because of the MOLLE compatibility. The knife is great quality and it's built tough. My knife didn't come very sharp but that might be the norm, i'm not sure. I had to return the first two knives because the blades were scratched up. The third knife blade was also scratched up but I kept it anyways to avoid a never ending return game."
5,Gerber LMF II Black Infantry Knife,Skip the flashy Bear Grylls knife and just go for this. My friend served in Iraq and carried this knife with him and recommended it to me. Now I am to you. Just get it!
4,Great Beatiful Knife,"Everything about it is great. even down to the sharpener. It is much much bigger than the Gerber Prodigy Survival Knife which i wasn't expecting. the prodigy seemed the perfect size for me. this seems a little big but then again, its a far more rugged useful knife and tool so i understand it being much bigger. also its an infantry knife so i should have guessed. the leg straps are of much better quality than the prodigy and it comes with two so you can strap it to your calf. Its great just very large, not too large i would say, especially for a bigger fellow. but for thin smaller men, like myself it just seems too large. but that is just my opinion, its probably the perfect size for most. and like i said, for what it is to be used for, the larger size is perhaps necessary."
5,LMF II Black Infantry Knife,"This knife was recommend to me, by a local dealer. Who knew my son was getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan. It is well made, nice weight and balance. It is being use currently in Afghanistan. A couple of other soldiers of my son's unit have bought one for themselves.I had even purchased one for myself. I would highly recommend this knife for hunting or fishing purposes"
4,Pretty rowdy knife!,"This knife is great! I first purchased the SOG seal pup, which I liked other than the zytel handle, but once I found out it was made in Taiwan, i just couldn't keep it. So many things now you can't get made here, but a knife isn't one of them.I read reviews on this thing, and by first glance it looks like a workhorse. HEAVY. Much heavier and beefier than i expected. but I think it will grow on me that way when i don't have to carry an axe too.I love the options with this knife, the holes for fashioning a spear are cool. Hammer end works really well. The sheath gives many options for carry, almost too many. Parts of me love it and some think there are just too many options which leads to parts of it getting in the way. you must unstrap much of the sheath to use the sharpener, or to be comfortable using it in the sheath as a hammer.Very Sharp I thought as well."
5,Son in Law Approved!,I got this knife from my son in law's Christmas list. He and my daughter like to hike in the Red River Gorge in KY and there is more black bear activity so I feel like they are more secure! Really beautiful knife and sheath with built in sharpener.
2,"Nice Sheath, Nice Blade, Poor Handle","I bought one and after removing it from and inserting it back into the sheath just a few times, the rubber on the handle began to separate and curl outwards. I then ordered another, took it into the woods for maybe an hour for some light use. I did little more than hack at some branches, but when I returned home I noticed the plastic bit on the handle that immediately surrounds the base of the blade (the tang)was pulling apart. Needless to say, I was very disappointed after spending quite some time researching knives and reading positive reviews about this one. I emailed pictures to Gerber and they were polite, but offered no solutions. Both knives are en-route back to Amazon.On a positive note, the sheath is of the utmost quality, very versatile, and very comfortable! I only wish I could keep the sheath and put another more durable knife in it."
3,Awesome blade... fail handguard,"blade was phenomenal. SUPER sharp out the box. Serated edge worked like a charm though any cord or rope. The black finish looks AMAZING. Great blade. Phenomenal Blade.BUT......The hand guard started peeling off on me every time I slid it back into the sheath. I've read some reviews of people saying it took a lot to put it back into the sheath but I didn't think it took that much of an effort. Plus I felt secure knowing the blade wouldn't accidentally just fall out of my pocket. But little did I know that the hand guard would slowly peel back every time I put it in the sheath..Maybe I got a dud... but if you're going to use another sheath, then i HIGHLY recommend this knife. If not, well then I hope you get a better quality hand guard."
5,Can't get a better quality knife for the price,"I was looking for a good fixed blade for hiking, and was sold on the number of good reviews for the LMF2. And I got it fast! Ordered on a monday, shipping confirmed on a tuesday, the smiling Amazon box greeted me at my door on wednesday! And the knife didn't disappoint. Everything about it looks and feels high quality. I love the options the sheath gives you. It fits on my 5.11 RUSH bags perfectly. The blade is nice and thick, the knife feels balanced, stout. The strike cap feels like it will do what its made for, smashing sh*t. The straight edge is not as sharp as I thought it would be, but it looks like an edge that will last in the field, plus the serrations are more than sharp enough if you need to cut through something fast! I'm pretty rough on gear, so I can't wait to see how this sucker will hold up. I think anyone that's looking for an all around, workhorse blade, this is it."
4,Specs on knives need to be better on Amazon,"The blade is NOT 3 3/4 inches long as written in description.It is 4.84 inches long.And most knives in Amazon do not indicate blade lengths which is critical.And we're Americans- at LEAST give it to us inches and not just metric.Lastly, tell us where the knives are made. Had to look everywhere on the webto finally confirm the Sog seal knives were in fact made in Taiwan."
4,Great Survival Knife,"Excellent knife, and excellent quality. This knife can take severe punishment, and at the end of the day, if you find it has become a bit dull, pass it through the sharpener (included in sheath) to tune it up. I highly recommend this knife for survival, or general occasions. The only knife I would recommend higher, is the Bayley S4. However if you are on a budget, this is the knife for you. As always Amazon seems to be the best place to purchase anything, and their service is second to none!"
3,GREAT KNIFE.SHEATH NOT PRACTICAL,"The knife is great, but the sheath is just not usable for every day use,I understand the military thinking behind this sheath,even though it makes a loud noise with removal and replacement, If you don't tie it down you can not remove it from the sheath with one hand.I returned mine and ordered a KBAR FULL SIZE..Great AMAZON price and service, Just didn't like the sheath..."
5,Gerber LMF II,"I just received this today so I don't have any real world use to report on as of yet but I DO know a quality piece of engineering when I see one. You know the often quoted ""That's not a knife, THIS is a knife!""? Well, simply put, THIS is a knife. The weight is extremely satisfying in the hand, the blade is sharp and the grip is solid. This thing is intimidating if nothing else. I will be taking this with me on a 4 month trip to Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Thailand and Vietnam and will update my review upon returning."
5,now this is a knife...,This knife is awesome feels great and looks mean now im going to buy the coyote and od green ones..
4,Solid knife,"The destructive test on you tube really sold me on this knife. I like it a lot but if I had to complain, I'd like Gerber to come up with a stronger plating process. The black finish on this blade starts to rub off after maybe a dozen insertions and removals from the sheath.Not a big deal as it's stainless but it would be nice to see them use something similar to what comes on Glocks."
4,Great ruged knife,"Ive been in scouts my whole life so ive owned many difrent knives, this I have to say has been the best one yet, Ive cut wood, rope, cardboard, cloth and some copper wire with it and it takes it all. The shieth is a litle hard to deal with since its designed for a military type uniform not jeans and a leather belt, so I took all the velkro of and just tuck it under my belt with a cord around it. Great product!!"
4,Great knife at a good price,very sharp and sturdy. Not sure I'll ever need to punch through my canopy but still a great knife.
5,Gerber Infantry Knife,"This knife is AMAZING! Upon receiving and taking it out of the package I was immediately impressed. I have owned many Gerber knives in the past and wanted to get one that would be highly useful in the outdoors. I took this knife with me and used it for some light work outdoors and again, have been more than impressed.I have used it against some decent sized trees and limbs and it has exceeded my expectations. The handle felt very sturdy when I first tried it out and also just for the hell of it, I put it to a nail and a board and it completely held up as a hammer. The only thing I have not tried is the built in sharper because well, when I first received it, I took it to an old phone book and it cut right through so there is no need to to sharpen it right now.All in all, if needed, I would buy another one of these and have also recommended it to numerous friends.Great buy!"
5,"77 ""ubt"" is an idiot","First of all, I own this knife. It's a nice well made knife, and for the money it's a great value. If you want a better knife be prepared to bust out the checkbook! Secondly, 77""ubt"". What kind of review was that? Learn to speak some English and form a proper sentance and then maybe your review will at least make sense. I doubt it will be much better though. If you couldn't break a glass window with the pommel of this knife you are either 6 years old, or completely worthless. And anyone complaining about how much pressure it takes to remove the knife from it's sheath better hope they never find themselves in a survival situation anyway! This is a great knife, and for under 100 bucks it's an incredible value. Period."
3,LMF II,"Absolutely no issues with quality of this product and Amazon's price are $30-40 cheaper than what I have seen locally. The handle is the most comfortable knife handle ever, but it only gets three stars because I wish the knife had a full length blade without the serrations."
4,Gerber LMF II Knife,"Props.Upon receiving this brilliant tool (wouldn't really consider it a knife really... it has SO many uses), i was very impressed with not only the quick shipping by amazon (thanks boys), but also the amazing sheath and harness straps that came with the knife!The ONLY REASON i did not give this knife 5 stars is because: one - i just got it and have not made it to the wilderness yet (its below freezing out there... ill wait till spring thanks), and two - i do not know its true durability.I can say however that this is one of the finest pieces of equipment for its kind. I am going to be living in jungles in central and south america in the near future for a long duration of time. With this knife + my survival skills... anywhere is my home."
1,Damaged Product,"The knife arrived in a ripped Gerber box. Upon opening, the pommel has scarring all over it and the worst part, the smooth part of the blade has gouging marks that are pretty deep. I paid for a new knife and I was sent a used one. Unacceptable."
2,Way to big for an adventureing knife.,"I bought this knife mainly for its sturdieness and versatility. When i got it, i opened up the package and found that the sheith is so incredibly bulky and not monuverable i am returning it. Also the handle is of the most not ergonomic designs i have ever seen. This knife would not be good for anything but playing rambo and killing people"
4,Good Knife,"Nice solid knife. Sheath is a little bit tight, but I suppose its better than falling out. Integrated sharpener is sub-par but ok in an emergency. Serated edge is on the wrong side, but its not a huge deal. Came nice and sharp."
5,Love Max and Ruby,I like Max and Ruby because it's NOT a very noisy or boisterous show. It's almost as calm and relaxing as hearing the story read from a book. The children (ages 3-7) love it and I find myself watching it alongside and laughing at Max's teasing and playing jokes on his very practical older sister.
5,wonderful product,"This was a grade aa+ product very easy to install, and operates with smooth motion. Doesn't stick or hang up."
5,Great set for one reason,"This set is for anyone that is a fan of UFC/MMA. None of these fights have been released on DVD, mainly due to none of the UFN's being released on DVD making every fight on this set hard to find. Since its a best of, you are getting the best of the first 3 UFC Fight Night events(12 fights including pre-lims that weren't even aired on the broadcast). I recommend this set for everyone!DVD Set IncludesJosh Koscheck vs. Pete SprattMike Swick vs. Gideon RayKenny Florian vs. Alex KaralexisSpencer Fisher vs. Thiago AlvesBrandon Vera vs. Fabiano SchernerChris Leben vs. Edwin DeweesSpencer Fisher vs. Aaron RileyMelvin Guillard vs. Josh NeerDuane Ludwig vs. Jonathan GouletChris Leben vs. Jorge RiveraDrew Fickett vs. Josh BurkmanStephan Bonnar vs. James Irvin"
2,Misleading,"I am a avid reader of David Brook's column in the NY Times and I enjoy his comments, most of the time anyway, on the Lehler Newshour. I am disappointed in ths collection of essay portrayed as ""New Conservative Writings."" I didn't find any thing in any essay that, in my opinion, was conservative in the Burkean or Russell Kirk vein of Conservatism. I think this is a very misleading title and the blurb by William Bennett was surely written for a book other than this one. I gave this a two star rating only because the writing itself was professional. Fr. True."
3,Excellent tape. This deal is a rip off.,"Comes in standard plastic case just like the ones in the big box stores. The problem is that it's a small roll in a big case. This is a 44 ft roll for 5.08. The big box version is a 66 foot roll for over a buck less. It fills up the case. Yeah, the length is in the description but I honestly didn't think to check to see if buying a freaking roll of brand name (excellent) tape left me open to yet another ripoff. Mea culpa."
2,makes political communication a bore,"Had this as a textbook for a political communication class and really did not like it. I can't say I hated it, because it could have been worse. It is a terrible amalgam of different research reports that sometime overlap each other to the point of driving you mad. Also, the different authors come from so many different backgrounds that it is hard to get a grasp on what they are talking about because they all approach the subject in different ways and quote scientific research that the reader is expected to know."
5,very soulful,"This must be part of your collection, especially if you are interested in Ben Webster. It gets better each time I listen to it; Oscar Peterson, Herb Ellis and Ben Webster are just great together. Don't hesitate, pick it up, you'll love it!"
4,"Technically perfect, artistically exciting","I bought this book because of the cover, and fortunately the content does not disappoint as well.The images within this book are all technically perfect, so it also serves as a great learning tool for myself as a fashion/editorial photographer. It gives me inspiration and definitely shows me what CAN be done with the camera. The photographers featured in this book are mostly quite well-known with only a few exceptions and some of their ideas can make you wonder 'how on earth did he/she think of THAT?'. I recommend this book. A delightful tea time reading."
5,Absoulutely Amazing,"I received this book for my 17th birthday. I am a budding photographer and I hope to become involved in the fashion industry when I leave school. This book is fantastic. The images as well as the style of the photgographers was diverse and interesting. Photographers featured include David LaChapelle, Mario Testino and Nick Knight. I loved it and I would really recommend this book to anyone."
5,Highly documented.,"If you are looking for a history of the early beginings of Joseph Smith this is the book. It contains the early history of JS in New Hampshire and New York. If you are looking for entertainment, don't look here. The reading is on the dry side, as it is historical in nature. A very good reference book"
5,The Best Book on Joseph Smith,Bushman's elegant thinking and writing present Smith's story from the *inside* as it must have felt to him and his followers. This is a great example of how to talk about religious controversy. He is now working on what promises to be the essential full scale biography of Smith--a most highly anticipated book.
2,Book not as described.,Ordered a very- good condition book and got a ex-library copy. Deciding that I got the book so cheap that I would go ahead and keep it. More of a hassle to send back.
5,Great Disc,"If you like roots reggae you may like this. If you like dubbed out downtempo a la K and D, Smith and Mighty, Rockers Hi-Fi and such artists you may like this. If you like both you will really really like this disc. Put those classic tracks in the remixer and voila, maximum listening pleasure. I personally like tracks 1 and 2 a lot at the moment although it still is new to me. After 5 seconds of the opening track I wanted more. I tried to wait til payday but gave in two days early, couldnt stand it. I think this one is sounding better than the second one and I am not as familiar with the first, although I did like second release a lot I just think this one has some gems on it. When is the next one coming out? I cant wait."
2,"Sadly, Not What I Ordered - Can't Return","I ordered the Crème Savers ""*Raspberry & Crème*"" candies and received Strawberries & Crème instead. (1) I do not like the Strawberries & Crème flavor, and (2) I can buy them at numerous local stores. I cannot find the Raspberries & Crème flavor, and so I ordered them (and waited for delivery) online. What a disappointment! And now I find I can't return them, even though they're unopened. I guess I hand them out to the local kids and try to find another source for the flavor *I* want."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a big book with a ton of names. We found that the only Hebrew books didn't have enough names so we bought this book. We were able to extend our list from this book but it is a lot to go through. Also, the English names are a litle hard to wade through."
3,Good but Obscure,"This book is great if you have someone specific to name after but don't like the particular name. It lets you look up names and gives you many ""equivalents."" The equivalents include by both meaning and masculine/feminine.However, many of the names in here were really overly obscure for our taste. There were just so many we would never consider naming our child and we certainly had never heard of ever.That being said, its an interesting reference."
5,The best book ever!!!,"This book is full of suspense, you'll never know what will happen next. I recomend this book to everybody, but especialy the people that haven't read agatha's books, because this story will show you the wonders that this woman could write, and you'll be a christie's fan for life."
3,An interesting read,"Have had this title for years... it is nostalgic in many ways, but goes eventually to proved that goofing around doesnt pay"
5,Great product shipping price from seller is INSANE - learn to bulk discount,"Great product and it is hard to find. I was surprised by the low cost of the bulb by this particular seller. However their shipping price is absolutely insane. $19 for 4 light bulbs??? You could fit these bulbs in a USPS flat rate box for $10 and even that is high. How can a commercial seller even function at the same rates as a consumer?!Great bulbs, great bulb price, but I think the seller is wetting their beak with over price shipping and trying to earn extra money per order. This will be my first and LAST order from this seller."
2,Not best for an Interior kitchen,"I have an interior kitchen and after reading the reviews on this light bulb I thought this is the one I have to have. I don't like them at all for the kitchen it gives off a soft amber glow and not a bright white lighting like I wanted, this light would be much better for a bedroom. Will be replacing them right away."
2,Tony Horton's Power 90,"The videos did not meet my expectations. The transitions between moves were too quick and injury prevention was not emphasized enough. The videos push his nutritional supplements instead of focusing on endurance, CV strength and training."
4,Good workout.,This is a great workout. I'm about 30 days into it and have really felt myself tone up. Look forward to continuing in the workouts.
3,Effective but boring,"I read a lot of reviews about the P90x and decided I needed something for a beginner. Let me tell you, even for a beginner this is difficult but you can work your way through it. What I don't like is that for someone who generally does not enjoy excercise this is a very boring video. Visually its not stimulating and there is very little music and so its been difficult for me to look forward to excercing with this video. In any case when I have used it I could definitely feel the muscles I worked out the next day."
4,Perfect Before P90X,Having previously ordered Tony Horton's P90X and found it to be a a bit more than I was ready to tackle I decided to give Power 90 a go and am I ever glad that I did. This package really helps to get you started with the routine and emphasizes the point of moving at your own pace while building up your stamina. I would highly recommend this product (use in the proper manner) to anyone thinking of exercising. Whether you are just starting or looking for a new routine it is difficult to go wrong with exercise.
4,Changed my life.,This program can get pretty repetitive but it works. Great if you want to get back in to shape. I used to have anxiety attacks but they stopped after I started this. I also dropped 16 pounds! Now I am doing P90X to continue my fitness journey.
4,A good workout,"A comprehensive workout for those new or returning to fitness. Good alternate day schedule with cardio on one day and weight training on the other with a 1 day rest each week. Tony has great energy and is pretty inspiring. For those with a decent level of fitness, this workout might be too tame though.Personally, i have lost weight and inches by following this program, highly recommended."
5,"Real Results, Real Fast","When I started Power 90 I was 5' 10 and weighed 253 lbs. After my first 90 days I lost 37 lbs and am in the best shape I have been in since high school. The workouts proved difficult at first but my commitment has paid off. Do not try this program unless you can commit as it will kick your butt. My father and I did the program together at the age of 53 he was able to lose 25lbs himself. I will say, completing this program at the same time someone else did in my house really helped keep me motivated. I can't wait to start P90X."
5,One hour power to shower!,"Get back in shape! This program helped me a lot. Highly recommend for anyone that does not meet the P90X minimum fit test. I did 1-2 for two weeks, then 3-4 for one month, getting more out of P90X, nothing will get you ready for AB Ripper X! If you plan to do P90X, I would use that nutrition plan over the Power90 plan, you will know when to go to phase 2. Push Play Every Day!"
2,SO boring-- for the very beginner,"This product really coddles you from beginning to end with the types of foods you should eat to the sequencing of videos. The problem is, if you have had any moderate exercise in your recent past, this will likely be too easy. I've only done it for a month now, and haven't gained anything significant beyond what swimming was giving me before. I would recommend this only to someone who needs to be on a regimen that will get them off the sofa and inform them of what to eat. It's really for someone who is totally out of shape and can tolerate monotony. I immediately had to start with the second 3-4 discs because the 1-2 were beyond easy. I get bored easily if I'm not challenged, and after a month, this is no longer challenging to me at all. I'm going to start P90x this week, so hopefully that builds the muscle I'm looking to build."
5,It works if you do,"My cousin's husband lost 20 lbs doing this and didn't change his diet, just put in the time. He's now on P90X and has lost another 8lbs. This is a great place to start and if you just follow the program it works, if you sit on the couch it doesn't. Simple as that."
3,not for me.,"I chose this program because of the comments that said P90X is not for someone who's not in great shape. Well, Power 90 is for someone who's never seen the inside of a gym, ever.Im not in a good shape by any means, but I expected workouts that were challanging. this is a very begginer slow paced, go at your comfort level kind of workout. needless to say, i didnt see any results. It's not enough of a workout for me.aside from that, its extremely repetitive, its the same workout day in and day out.Tony is and always will be amazing in my view. he's not annoying, keeps the ramblings to a minimum, considering you have to watch this video every day. I will be ordering a more challanging product."
2,Buyer Beware,If you think you're getting the full P90X set here think again. It's a much shortened version and not at all worth the big price tag. I used a gift card so at least it eased the $$$ pain a bit.
5,This system works!,"I've been doing this for just about a month now and I've dropped 10 pounds! I'm a recent college graduate who saw his athletic high school body get away from him during 4 and 1/2 years of college. Trying to get back in shape now, and this seems like the right choice. The exercises are easy enough, but you will break a sweat. Plus, doing it for 6 out of 7 days during the week, you will feel the difference in your body each week. As a former high school ice hockey player (now I just play in the beer leagues), I've always had bigger legs then I had arms, but this program has already given me more arm strength then I've ever had in my life and I'm not even half way thru!I'm excited to see the results on day 90, so it is easy for me to keep pressing play. Knowing that this system works, I'm going to keep on going to start my journey of getting back into shape."
3,resistance bands over work muscles.,"Working Tony Horton's system is fantastic. Tonys one of the best personal trainers i've ever had the pleasure of ""working with"". Although at times the workout made me vomit after one half of an hour. This system is wonderful and would deserve five stars, if, The resistance bands weren't so hard on the muscles. After about three months of using Tony Horton's system using the resistance bands the stress of using the rubber bands turned my muscles into what i can only describe as stiff, stressed, and tough as over cooked turkey. Had to cut my workouts down to twice a week after the bands caused my muscles to stiffen. Barbells are the way to go if u want real results without the muscle stiffness. 4 stars with the barbells 3 if useing bands. Can only speak from my personal experience. But i've ceased to continue with the bands."
3,"Not worth it, if you use gym classes already","I purchased this product after reading that the Pro 90X was very difficult for people that are not already in pretty good condition. Many people said to get this version and work up to the Pro 90X. I got this and I have to say if you already use a gym and take weight and/or conditioning classes, this video is not worth it. I would say if you don't go to a gym or take any weight/conditioning classes and you have not exercised in a while, this may be good for you.My gym classes are much longer, play great music, have several different size weights to use, and the instructors work every muscle from the top of your body to the bottom and the sides of all muscles. They also start and end with good stretches as well.I was under the impression that this Tony Horton had better exercises that get your body in great shape after 4 weeks, well my classes seem better than his, so I returned this product."
1,Marketing success story,"There are so many better workouts than this low-budget production. Doing the same workout routine for 90 days is completely inefficient, not to mention that Horton is arrogant and annoying the first time you do the workout. By the end of the first week, you just want to smack him and his big ""MAH-suhls"" every time he talks like Arnold.The timing is off (again...a low-budget, one-take workout) and the stretching is pathetic. Plus, there are wrist curl exercises...give me a break! ""Huh, huh, huh...specificity, my friend!"" says Mr. High-and-Mighty. How about some variety, Tony?Don't waste your money...or your time."
1,Boring,"There are only a two exercises and you are suppose to do one the first day and then the other the second day, over and over. The advanced version is only slightly different and still easy! I was bored after one week.Kate"
3,Good Workout,This is a good workout. I did it with my parents because they're older and didn't know if they could handle P90X. I thought this was a little easy for me ( I was 17 and a three sport athlete when I did it). If you're not as in shape it's great or if you have any problems with your joints. I've heard that P90X is much more challenging. It all depends on what you think you can handle.
5,Great dvd series,I love beach body and their workouts. This one is great if you have gotten out of the habit of working out or need a low/moderate intensity program to help ease you into a regular workout routine.
5,Does What It Promises,"I have lost 40 pounds in the past 3 months by using Power90 and changing my eating habits. Originally I was going to do P90X, but after doing a little research I realized I was way too heavy and out of shape. Power90 starts out gradually, and allows you to progress at your own rate. During the workouts, Tony repeatedly encourages you to push it, but also tells you to do what you can and realize that you are making progress and burning calories by doing what you can. After a month and a half I started mixing in level 3-4 a couple times a week, and at 2 months switched totally to level 3-4. Overall, if you want to get in shape but recognize that you need to start out gradually, this is the way to go."
4,Good work out but not enough variety,"There are 5 workouts in this package. There are 2 Sculpt, 2 Cardio and a bonus cardio. I find that the workout has made a big difference in my overall fitness. The instructor is very good at saying how to modify the workout to your needs and ability - increase weight, modify movements. The problem I personally have with this package is that there is not enough difference between the first and second Sculpt workouts, nor is there enough difference between the first and second Cardio workouts. So after a month of doing the first Sculpt workout, I was excited to advance to the second and was very disappointed to find the same old exercises I had been doing for a month.Still this is the best workout I have found. I did find that the bonus cardio workout did provide some variety."
3,Is not compatible with SLT cameras,"Bought the Sigma lens for my A35. Auto-focus doesn't work.This has been the issue for many of the Sigma lenses, some of them can be rechipped by sending back to Sigma. But older lenses like this one are out of luck."
5,Perfect Gift,"Granddaughter is an upcoming inspiring artist and just love these pencils...I would recommend them because of the multiple colors and she said the erasers, lol."
3,Did not erase very well,"The colors blended really well, but they did not erase like I thought they should. Even when they were used very lightly, they did not erase."
1,Does not erase,"If you're looking for an erasable pencil, this isn't what you want. Thought it would be a great idea to try out my new erasable pencils on a graph for an assignment. Needless to say, when I made my first mistake and tried to erase it, the color was still completely visible, perhaps only faded by 50%. Very false advertising, especially when the box indicates that markings will be FULLY ERASED.Tried other colors (first scarlet red, then green, then pink, then white). Couldn't erase markings with either the built-in erasers or my stick eraser. The only one which I couldn't see at all after erasing was white!"
1,WEAK,"These pencils absolutely suck, don't buy them. I'll choose crayola over these anyday!!!!They have weak leads that also break easily."
4,Clay Has A Gift!,"Clay Aiken happens to be one of my all time favorites that came through the American Idol wringer and gave us the opportunity to listen to his awesome range of voice and feeling. I would have tagged this DVD with 5 Stars as a rating but for two things. This Christmas special was done in a cozy atmosphere which was presumably a living room with fireplace, tree and goodies placed everywhere. At the same time there were tables outside of that living room area where people sat to listen, almost a cabaret like setting. While I find nothing at all wrong with Clay's voice and selections of Christmas material to sing for us, I find it odd that so little interaction went on between his ""guests"" and himself! His musical guests, on the other hand were warm and friendly but it was Clay's show and I believe it was his responsibility, in such an intimate setting to interact just a bit more with his living room kids and adult listeners at the tables. He also needs a dresser...badly!"
5,Clay Aiken Christmas,"It's AWESOME. Mary did you know beautiful, and song # 6 ""Don't save it all for Christmas toward the end he holds a note longer than anyone I've ever heard It's truly remarkable. This is my very favorite CD of all time!!! Clay is Wonderful. I highly recomend it. I bought 4 copies so far for family and freinds."
3,"Excellent music, but not sure what happened with the rest","Of course, the music was fantastic - with three top performers like Clay Aiken, Barry Manilow and Yolanda Adams, it had to be good.I didn't get to see the television programme, but was disappointed with this DVD. The behind-the-scenes style of filming was a bit strange. It was sort of as - why did we even bother having an audience on the set if we weren't going to really talk to them or interact with them during the show. Save that behind-the-scenes stuff for the extra stuff on the disc."
3,I thought the special was boring,They should have just filmed one of his concerts from his Joyfull noise tour where he sang with a full orchestra. That would have been awesome!Clay's Christmas album is great but the tone is mostly dramatic. On this special they tried to make it cheery and happy and the material just didn't lend itself well to that.
3,"Good music, disappointing production","As a Clay fan I was really looking forward to his Christmas special. My two young girls liked Clay on American Idol and I thought this would be a fun way to introduce non-animated Christmas material. Boy was I disappointed. The actually singing was amzing, though I would have liked more Clay and less guests. But the idea to show us ""how the show was made"" was annoying. Finding out it was taped on Halloween shattered what little Christmas mood there could be when you are watching ""private"" conversations between Clay and his guests.Do yourself a favor and buy the CD instead of the DVD. I give three stars for the singing, not the production of the show."
1,Not very talented,Clay Aiken doesn't seem like that great of a singer. Why is he famous? This dvd doesn't showcase his voice at all and he's got a squeaky voice overall.
3,a book for beginers in medium format,"I've found the book is writen in a very simple terms. For beginers can be useful, but if you are not a beginer, you won't learn much thinks reading it. As a conclusion, if you want to buy a medium format camera and you don't know anything about it, you can buy this book, but if you are not a beginner, don't spend your money with this book."
4,"It actually merits 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option...","'Doors' is a worthy effort. For fans of the suspense/thriller genre, or for anyone that enjoys well-written prose with believable characters and realistic dialogue. The tempo of the story is even-keeled, Key demonstrates great sagacity in this effort, all the more remarkable it is his first book published.In sum, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Doors' and found it well-worth every penny. I can't wait to see more of Key's works published in the future..."
5,antenna cable,"I bought this cable for my wifes Nissan, the old Bose unit had lost its luster, installing this cable and the non oem radio,was simple, just plug and play ,the fm quality with this connector is identical to factory,am is also clear,if you change out your radio unit in your car this is a must buy for the money."
2,It doesn't work for my 2000 Nissan Altima,"This antenna adapter doesn't work for my 2000 Nissan. After I installed it to my new car radio, I could only received very few FM stations, no AM station at all. Tried to switch back to my original nissan adapter, but it can't fit into the new radio. Luckily I don't listen to the FM/AM very often."
5,The apple of my eye,"This is a fantastic TV. As a college student who is searching for optimal space allocation, this baby is perfect. Buying this Philips was the result of hours and hours of comparision shopping. I needed a mate for my Playstation 2, and I must say, they're a perfect match. The S-Video is absolutely breathtaking and I don't think a tube TV could get much better. Some people have complained about the corners being rounded and clipped but I find it minimal. This TV is a great buy."
1,Philips nonwarranty,"Mine failed after 15 months, goes blank after being on a few seconds. Took a look at the ""warranty""--they'll repair it but I have to pay for any parts or labor."
3,Not for a casual reader,No doubt about the research and effot put in this book. It has a lot of information about the fundamentalism in world's three prominent religions and a lot of hard facts on them. But definitely this book is not suited for a casual reader like me as the amount of data presented completely fails to keep the interest of a casual reader. I would recommend this book only to a serious reader interested in data rather than their treatment or analysis.
4,"5 stars, except...","it gets a little bogged down at the beginning. Otherwise, it seems to be historically accurate, and it is one of those books that stimulates thought.This is my 3rd Karen Armstrong book to read. From a satisfied reader, it sure won't be my last.Kudos, Karen."
1,A Confusing and Demoralizing Treatise on the Major Religions,"This book screams out, ""Please God, I want to believe in you but I can't!"" Armstrong was a nun and now doesn't know whether she is Buddhist or Muslim, so how can she be objective about the major religions? She is writes with very little insight. She presents an evasive, ambiguous, and confusing theory of religion. Not a good book to read if you are interested in any of the religions she discusses, or should I say dissects and rips apart?"
1,A very confused lady,"The one star is for two reasons:First, I can't give anything lower, which is stupid.Second, she is an easy read.That being said, Ms. Armstrong is one confused, mixed up, and disillusioned lady. It seems that all, or most of her books end up discrediting all religions but Islam. Maybe she gets a ""kick"" out of suicide bombers, terrorists, killers, torturers, beheaders, and the like. Even though she dislikes most fundamentalists, she loves the Muslims. What a convoluted brain! Or maybe she has her head so buried where the sun doesn't shine that she actually doesn't know what's going on in the world today."
1,More pop social psychology babble,"Let's see, ""modernization"" and ""Western consumerism"" (whatever that is) were long thought to be the bane of religion. Now, we have a study that says these same things are what spur religious zeal. Hmmmm...the ultimate tautology it seems. Basically ""consumerism"" can explain anything you want it to. Maybe the author should tell us what a ""non-consumer"" culture looks like (do people just produce stuff and leave it sit around). This book is methodologically unsound and theoretically vacuous. Try again."
4,A history of the western concept of God,"I found this to be a facinating history on the development of Western Civilization's concept of God. Starting with the ancient Hebrews, whom Ms Armstrong indicates were originally polytheistic, she traces the development of monotheism and the way in which the concept of God changed over time. I would have given this book 5 stars, but unless you are into the history of religion, you may lose some interest in later parts of the book as it gets into more scholarly detail."
4,Excellent Prospective,"The book provided me with some much needed prospective. I am currently trying to come to terms with both religion and politics. I come from a evangelical tradition that I can't fully identify with, and I live in a country whose political ambitions often make no sense to me. This book has gone a long way to helping me understand the nature of the middle east as well as the nature of my own family.Karen's writing is conversational, coherent, and extremely thorough. It's taken me much longer than usual to finish this exceptional book because it is so dense. It gets four stars, rather than five, because the message Karen so brilliantly puts forth could be delivered to a much broader range of people."
3,Not for a casual reader!,"No doubt about the research and effot put in this book, it has a lot of information about the fundamentalism in world's three prominent religions and a lot of hard facts on them. But definitely this book is not suited for a casual reader as the amount of data presented completely fails to keep the interest of a casual reader alive. I would recommend this book only to a serious reader interested in data and hard facts rather than their treatment or analysis."
3,Interesting and annoying,"A very interesting, but a bit repetitive book. Sometimes the lack of depth in her theories are irritating. Like her theory that monotheism was a creation of the urbanized civilizations. Where does she get that from? Rome, ancient India and China were all very urbanized (much more than Palestine) and very polytheistic. There must be another reason for the development of monotheism. I think it's a typical ignorant western christian view to look at monotheism as the crown of a religious evolution. Besides that and some other things the book is well worth reading."
5,Excellent overview of fundamentalist thought,"Fundamentalism of the Christian and Islamic varieties are the great curse of our time.Christian fundamentalism in America subverts democracy, science and distorts rational thinking. Islamic fundamentalism is to be sure an even more radical and dangerous idea. Anderson, while concluding that fundamentalism is based upon fear and irrationality, nonetheless approaches the history of these movements in a balanced and well thought out manner.Ms Anderson does a stellar job of getting at the historical basis for fundamentalism, explaining the theological arguments and putting them within the historical context of their time. This can be read solely as a history rather than as a religion/theological tract.I can highly recommend this work by Karen Anderson, the first I've ever read by her."
5,Journey to History,"In this book Karen Armstrong discusses the causes and effects of fundamentalist movements in three main religions. Namely; Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Her knowledge about these religions are tremendeous. The book is very interesting and has lots of historical stories and information. I strongly recommend this book for those who would like to know more about fundamentalism and history of these religions."
1,Lack of adequate references and a slanted prespective,"Ruth Armstrong's entry regarding the Babi Religion and the Baha'i Faith is grossly inaccurate. In one passage she claims that the Bab stated in the Bayan that there is no life after death. Yet, she never provides a direct quote from the Bayan nor does she reference it. In the Bayan it is clearly stated that the soul ascends to the spiritual realm after death. She only provides one or two references about the Babi Religion and the Baha'i Faith and from that she derives profound conclusions. Speculation is not scholarly and it should never be presented as the truth. I strongly recommend that Karen Armstrong investigate this topic more thoroughly. She just hasn't done her homework and that is irresponsible."
1,Disappointing,"There is no question that fundamentalist religious sensibility has been on the rise in all religions over the last 50 years and, likewise, no doubt that this has been a period of rapid cultural and technological change. Armstrong's book makes no particular contribution, however. It does not reflect any nuanced views even of the historical antecedents of this recent era. It strings conventional and dated scholarly conclusions tediously with a glib assurance. The world, even the world that generates fundamentalists of so many religious varieties, is more complex unfortunately than Armstong's narrative."
3,Detailed but could be better organized,"As a history of the development of religion fundamentalism (in the Abrahamic faiths - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), this book is very detailed and will not disappoint the reader who is committed to learning something new. I would, however, take issue with the organization of the book. Constantly lapsing between one religion and another, the structure of the book does not make for easy reading or comprehension. You will have to be a committed enthusiast for understanding religious fanaticism to get through it. That said, I think Armstrong's book is overall a fascinating look at a dark and disturbing topic."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was overall very disappointing. Written in a very chaotic and amateurish manner, the narrative constantly kept striking me as naive and superficial. Add to this the religious ignorance (and intolerance) of the writer and his profound lack of familiarity with non-christian religions and atheism alike, and you get a reading that is anything but inspiring to anybody who can think critically.Although the personal accounts of his experiences under communism and during his escape ring somewhat true to a Bulgarian reader like me, they are not related in a way that could 'save' the book. Too bad really..."
3,I wouldn't say it's a waste of time...,"really. It's a short book of one man's experience, however skewed or one-sided. I am Bulgarian as well and if you can put aside the writers feelings of devotion and obvious joy in his religious beliefs, it's a good read. There is excitement and adventure in this story, regardless of his personal beliefs. This book was published by a religious publisher so it makes sense there would be an overwhelming Christian perspective.Another aspect of this writer's book, is how it reflects a perspective of religious freedom that he didn't experience in his own country (the 1970's) and this is shown in his book."
4,Still wonderful music all these years later,Great album. Used to have it on Cassette tape and wore it out. Now have it on Vinyl and it is fantastic
2,Not the best one out there,"I was disappointed in both documentaries. In fact I consider them less to be documentaries and more subjective conspiracy theories with little objectivity. With little / no tie into the movie or book, the information is scrambled. I much prefer the History Channel's dvd on the DaVinci code to this one."
5,Perfect bedroom TV,"I love the design, it's not just a square box, but ease of using sleep timer was clincher. Push of one button forwards it in 15 minute increments. I was wide awake by the time I programed my prior set's timer, an RCA.The wake up timer is also easy to set. It does require a few steps though to initialy program but from then on it's one button too. You can wake to TV or 3 different alarms(rooster, xylophone or harp). It does not have a radio though as one reviewer states.The nightlight is terrific, the two feet and clock have a cool neon glow. It too is set with push of one button. If you have it on, it will turn off automaticaly when you turn TV on.The picture quality is fine, as it is for most TV's, and stereo sound is bonus for set this size. There are lot's of features to customize viewing.Overall this is great small TV with some unique features and design and is worth the somewhat premium price."
2,Clock doesn't work,"I'd been eyeing this TV as a bedroom TV because of it's great looks. The light up ""feet"" and clock are eye catching but once I brought it home, I found that the clock didn't work. This item is now out of production so I couldn't find a replacement for it."
5,Home Run,I love my 2x4 basic bench/table so much I bought another one. Now when I put them together I have a full size picnic table.
4,Good higher end Reciever,I bought this reciever because I am a fan of JVC products and it seemed like a better than average Reciever. It comes with DTS and Dolby Digital surround. It has room for 6 RCA inputs or 4 RCA and 2 digital (one coaxial and one optical). It can determin if the input is either analog or digital and can switch automatically. If you need a higher end Reciever then this is a rather cheap pick.
5,fantastic amazing versitile insightful fun,"Nortons first two albums are just the greatest, covers a lot of styles on this double album set, My favorite is ""Nobody Wants Me"" but all the songs are good. If you don't know, Norton is one of the greatest blues harp players int he world, and he doesn't only play the blues. You will hear tropical (like Buffet) type sounds ""Puerto De Azul"", old west kind of western sounds ""Hangin' Tree""&""High Tide in Wingo"", even a truck drivers song! ""Eighteen Wheels"". DONT get me wrong, I love rock/blues not country, but Norton has a way of making anything sound good, with his Amazing harmonica riffs, and a pationate wide ranging, voice (With funny voices too!) Get this Album, it is a steal for all the good tunes, and look for the new one by him and his new band the Knockouts coming soon!"
3,"Well, It Does LOOK Like a Doozer","When the Fraggle Rock toys started coming out, I had to have them for my collection. And never before have they made a Doozer toy. Now that I own them, I can give a good reason why: there really isn't much TO a Doozer. It's light green, and basically naked. The materials they used are pretty cheap and coarse, it's limbs are very stiff so it can't be put in any pose but one, and it lacks in the ""cuddly"" factor. However, it's a nice addition to the set, and it certainly is true to the original. It's just not a stand alone piece."
4,pop pop rosetti,My Grandson is autistic and is very responsive to anything that has to do with Fraggle Rock
4,Interesting book on Propaganda posters,"The book reprints many examples of both Allied and Axis propaganda posters. The reader can see, even though many are from different cultures, how the same the posters all are (appeals to patriotism, stirring up victories of old, etc.). It is a must for World War II buffs."
3,The Man Who Moved a Mountain,"The book was ok, not something that would appeal to everyone but a good book to waste an afternoon reading."
3,fair,The book was okay. It was listed as good oondition and it had places torn on the binding and a little smell. So I took it but I don't think it should have been listed as good condition. More like fair with some marks and tears .
4,a very good read,Great book. the facts and way of life during the time were unthinkable in today's day and age. Great look at a tough life.
5,"Awesome product, have used for 7+ years!","Excellent product. Did things well some receivers today don't do. USB connectivity for a receiver in 2002? Unheard of! One remote that does RF & Infrared, plus controls your infrared equipment in a closet via RF! And of course, great sound."
4,Excellent book,"The writing may not be perfect, but it's still a great textbook, probably the best you can find.After all, there is a reason that so many colleges use this book. You will learn a great deal whether you use this book for a class or for your own study."
1,Bad Seller. Good Amazon?,I never got my book from Intelligent Solutions. Amazon promised to reimburse but they have not so far.
1,Didn't enjoy this book,"I normally don't post reviews but I just finished up using this book for a class and highly dislike it. I think the reasoning with how they illustrate problems is confusing and terms are mixed up with bold or plain print. My professor even said he did not like this textbook and wished there was a better choice out there. I thought the homework was good but there were some points that it didn't make sense at all. My biggest pet peave had to deal with the Economic Ordering Quantity stuff in chapter 20. I read the chapter twice and still didn't understand the function of EOQ. I eventually found a powerpoint online which explained it. I think this book has potential and obviously the amount of time invested with the supplementary material is amazing. Regardless, I think there still needs to be more work done on this book. Good luck using this book in your class wherever you're forced to use it."
2,"Dense, verbose, boring","The writers of this book present a lot of material; however, they do so in a manner that may cause confusion and a general dislike of the material. Presentation is verbose, often using paragraphs to explain concepts that could be stated in one sentence. While some sidebars present necessary information, many of them are simply advertisements for the publisher's study guide."
5,Awesome Price,"The book came in perfect condition, it was delivered earlier than I expected, and it was a really good price!"
1,Disappointing,"Quality of the individual parts was good. However, the locking mechanism that prevents the winch from slipping in the opposite direction has a weak return spring, and isn't quite lined up with the gear. As a result, it does not lock consistently. Avoid this product if you need a working locking mechanism.I live in Hawaii, so return shipping is not worth the expense and hassle. It's a good size for throwing at the wild pig that visits in my yard at night. Don't need a working locking mechanism for that."
1,USED ITEM SENT WHEN I PURCHASED A NEW ONE AND BAD QUALITY,"We got a box and the stapler was inside without any plastic bag whatsoever. When we took it out, it was stained like if it was used before. BEWARE of this merchant since they will send you a returned ITEM as a new ITEM for the price of a NEW ITEM. This is a sort of swindling... I returned this and look somewhere else. Besides when I used the stapler you need to place the paper too far inside of the machine there is no way to graduate the distance of the staple and the edge of the page. I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS MERCHANT AT ALL!!!"
1,Items not yet indexed!,"When I enter a word all I get is the message ""Item Not Yet Indexed!"" What am I missing? I'm glad I didn't pay anything for this."
1,Completely Useless,"I'm sure the paper version would be great, but how are we supposed to use a reference book on Kindle if it the words in it aren't indexed? There's no way to look anything up!"
3,DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH SYNONYMES,"GOOD DICTIONARY. REFERENCE WORK. MANY MORE SUCH REFERENCE BOOKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY POST GRADUATE STUDENTS. COULD NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE LIKE THE REGULAR DICTIONARY THAT WORKS UNDERNEATH OTHER REFERENCE BOOKS"
2,Not indexed,If it were indexed it would actually be a useful thesaurus. The way its set up however makes it difficult to find what you're looking for.
2,Not what I was expecting...,"Maybe I didn't read the description, I just went with the title. I was expecting a traditional thesaurus type book, and this wasn't. Of course, for free, I can't really complain..."
3,use it a little,it ok haven't really use it that much so I can't really say much about it . so I have to say more .
2,Disappointed in beads compared to picture,over priced and beads were dull. Go to Michaels or another craft store so that you can see the actually product and pay a lot less
3,"Decent, but pricey","Nice product, but too overpriced for a bunch of cheap plastic and a few connectors. The quick pin anchors are cheap, cannot secure the components securely, and break easily."
4,White Indian Series,A well researched set of books. Read in the early 1980s can still remember a major portion of the books. Good historical research.
2,Disappointed,"Started reading this series years ago and thought I would be interested in it Again. However, the book is good but not written well enough to hold your attention that long to finish reading a number of books in that series.Read the Wagons West series and that series was the same way but I purchased the entire series and felt that I had to read the entire series to the end which I did,and I rated the series with two stars just like this book."
4,out of print book,This book shipped quickly and was in good condition. Would buy from this seller again.
3,Not very sustainable in the long run,"Due to a recent attack against me by the fan site that supports this line, at which point I had concerns for my personal safety, I would not reccommend parents buy this product for minors.While I find the main book for this line very well done, and the setting is definately very interesting, I find it difficult to maintain player interest for long campaigns due to the dark nature of the setting. And having them succeed, well...pretty much negates the setting in some ways.For someone looking for something different, I would say this may be what you are looking for. I would make sure your players are ready for the change, however, or they will grow quickly tired of having to fight for every inch. As for the supporting material...I found only the player's guide and the magic book to be of real help."
5,Joe walsh is a kick a** guitar player,Oh boy this album is one of the best guitar albums ever and its heavy rock n roll joe walsh is so underated in my books he can do anything on the guitar hes the guitar player for the eagles whats that tell you also he can tear up the blues you can see that on the 2007 eric clapton crossroads dvd anyways this album is great and everybody should have this in their collection i would buy this album just for the song the bomber anyways great guitar work pick this classic up its worth the buy
4,James Gang Rides Again,"I have liked this album since I first heard it in the first years of the 70's. Good hard driving Rock music of that era. If you ever see or hear Joe interviewed you may not pick him as the guy behind this kind of Rock, but in his day he was just about the best rocker out there and kind of crazy out of control. He now reflects back on that lifestyle as a part of his life that defines his demeanor of today. Way slowed down, mentally as well. Thanks for giving yourself up for us Joe, I have really enjoyed you there in my life with me. Enjoy!"
3,Funk #49 a hit and some other tunes,"Ok, historical as Joe Walsh was in the band and got his teeth on the touring road...you can hear the funk/rock sound and a band trying to develop their sound."
3,The good and the bad.,"I have danced to, partied to, tripped to and just quietly listened to this album since it first came out. Yes, one of all my time oldie favorites that I would never get tired of listening to, except for......The recording quality of this cd. Seems flat, over compressed maybe? Listening to ""Rides Again"" used (LP days) to be a roller coaster ride. Now it seems like going down the interstate with the cruise control on. I assure you, the fault is not my playback equipment.Damn shame, if it wasn't for the nostalgia trip, it'd be a struggle to give it 2 stars."
4,Walsh Rides On,"Joe Walsh is one of the most underappreciated musicians in rock music. Whether it be his work with The James Gang, The Eagles or solo work, he consistently makes quality and inspiring rock music. He may have been at his best with this Ohio-based band and Rides On is their finest effort. The album kicks off with a rock classic, the manic ""Funk #49"" which has a great riff. ""The Bomber"" shows off Mr. Walsh's guitar prowess with some wicked slide work. The first five tracks are classic arena rock, but the band shows there diversity with the second five tracks that form a song suite of sorts. They are more in the country-rock vein and show a softer side as opposed to the heaviness of the first five tracks. The James Gang never achieved the commercial success they deserved, but Rides Again is a great place to start to get an idea of the quality of this group."
5,Guaranteed to ride again and again on your CD player!,"This album represents the Joe Walsh incarnation of the James Gang at its artistic zenith. The band sails effortlessly through a breathtaking set that ranges from lovely, sparse acoustic folk and lush orchestration to no-holes barred crunching riff-rock. The newly remastered version also restores about a minute or so of the original extended Walsh guitar showcase that makes ""The Bomber"" such a memorable workout. For guitar afficiandos, this one song features just about every possibile demonstration of tonal and melodic expression a gifted player can communicate with minimal frills (just an Echoplex and a slide!).The set of connected songs on side 2 (if you've never had a vinyl copy, that's ""Tend My Garden"" through ""Ashes The Rain & I"") is comparable to the Beatles' groundbreaking ""Abbey Road"" suite. An excellent START on remastering the James Gang catalog...now, how about the Tommy Bolin era-- nudge nudge hint hint?"
5,The James Gang was amazing,"I got turned on to the James Gang by a friends brother who had just got back from Viet Nam. The album was Rides Again and I was hooked. This is one of my all-time favorite recordings. Joe Walsh was an innovative and rockin' guitar player who displayed a mixed bag of styles from blues, rock, country, folk and psychedelia. The James Gang had a tight and pounding sound of country rock melodies with a melancholy feel. Rides Again was a much more serious recording than Yer Album (see my review)with a fair mixture of electric and acoustical pieces. The highlight of Rides Again is the song The Bomber, which was an FM radio classic in the day when FM radio still rocked. This song is a prime example of the bands talent; truly a rock and psychedlic classic! Play this loud, sit back and enjoy. If you are disappointed then your taste for rock is beyond hope."
4,Enter Joe Walsh,"The big album for the James Gang.Yes I own an original of this album too.The cover art,Guys on harleys with long hair says it all.With Walsh on guitar the songs start out hard driving (acid) rock which fills your soul and slowly tapers off to a softer ballad type ending.This album ROCKS!"
1,inaudible,This is a cd.I think it has music on it but I'm not sure.Don't waste your money!It sounds like someone made a copy of an old worn out sassette
5,very good.,"Is it just me or did Joe Walsh do most of his better work while he was in the James Gang? I just got this album today and allready I love it. Part of it's electric, part of it's mellow. All of it is great. Not only is it a great sounding album, but it also has a damn nice cover. Simple, but nice."
5,"Many, many memories; now this was music!",Hadn't heard James Gang's music since the early 70's. Listening to the song samples over the net almost brought me to tears. They don't make music like this anymore! Those were the days of being a kid and living.
5,THE JAMES GANG MAKES ITS MARK,"""Rides Again"" captures this band on a rollercoaster of inspiration and keen musicianship. The James Gang created an eclectic masterpiece which contained many of the ingredients that Joe Walsh would later contribute to The Eagles sound on ""Hotel California"". Here you have the country rock charm of ""There I Go Again"" and ""Garden Gate"". ""The Bomber"" is a fierce rocker that contains at the core a display of slide guitar that will send chills up your spine. Joe Walsh was always one of the best slide players with that unmistakable signature sound and this is a perfect testament to his artistry. ""Tend My Garden"" stands out for its delicate melodic beauty and its tender lyrics. It's a memorable moment that Lennon and Mccartney would approve of. Other highlights include the sexy rugged groove of ""Woman"" and the manic boogie of ""Funk 49"". Now put all of these ingredients together and you have one tasty mix that is guaranteed to satisfy upon every listen."
3,Boy Unhappy off NYC,"It is a funny story of Chile seen through eyes of a boy-repatriate hanging around a city while his family is looking to his any trace desperately.In general, I am not impressed much."
4,Columbian catalog envelopes,"Very nice quality and a great savings over the Tyvek brand. Wish they were available in home-use quantities! Worth having some in stock, tho."
2,What is this?,"I have no idea what I am listening to. TD has been such a great instrumental group, but, with vocals they fall completely flat. As another reviewer wrote, it may be a good show to see but leave the lyrics out of it."
2,NO VOICES,"THERE IS A REASON WHY 99 PERCENT OF TANGERINE DREAM'S MUSIC LIBRARY HAS NO VOCALS IS BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T WORK! THERE IS A SAYING,IF AIN'T BROKE,DON'T FIX. WITH ANY LUCK, THIS LASTEST VENTURE WILL LET THEM KNOW,THAT 30 PLUS YEARS OF SUCCESS WAS NO ACCIDENT!"
2,LOOK OUT!,"This is a live concert of their new opus partly electronic opera with almost every track vocals and lyrics and well kind of like Rick Wakeman style of Journey to the center of the earth opera. Probably great to see but NOT AT ALL TANGERINE DREAM music. I hate to say it but, these guys have great ideas, but, they just don't have the talent to pull it off. Try Vangelis's recent Cd Mythodea which is the same but minus all lyrics and far superior."
3,Different,"I will buy almost anything with the TD name on it. So I ordered Inferno without even thinking. Upon listening 3-4 times I still can't decide what to make if it. But I do notice that I'm not called to play it much more. This is a complex, even elegant production, more operatic than electronic and rhythmic. (It is inspired by Dante's Inferno). But each time it starts to cook, there is a change up and another meandering vocal. I give TD high marks for trying something new, but a steady diet of this will surely reduce the number of fans."
3,WARNING-A trip to Inferno might send you to La La Land.,"Tangerine Dream combines their music with pretty vocals and it's entrancing at first but the cd's middle section lacks variety turning the music into a sleep inducing drone before recovering nicely in the final tracks.My wife summed up this cd inadvertantly because when the cd started she said ""What's that pretty music?"" and fell asleep on the couch and didn't wake up until the 2nd to last song.It's not as bad as everyone thinks it just could've used more spice (2nd part of TD's Dante project Purgatorio is better )and you have to keep in mind we're missing the visuals of the live productions of this music.Not for all tastes but not a total washout either."
3,Has TD lost it?,"The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars and not fewer is that this CD is listenable. Barely. If you've ever wondered what TD would sound like without any good drums, synthesizers, or ambient effects, this is it: cheesy synthesized strings and orchestral sounds, and no memorable melodies.The style is similar to Tyger, except that it doesn't work. If you want some good examples of TD using this style, I'd recommend their ""Book of Dreams"" collection, which has a couple much more tolerable songs in this style, as well as a lot of good ambient and early 80s stuff.Overall, it's not really the songs, or even the singers, that are disappointing. It's the fact that this CD sounds so totally bland and boring. One good note: the inside sleeve has a very nice, colorful design. If the music was similar in style and quality, this would be a very good album."
1,DONT BUY THIS JUNK!,"JUST HORRIBLE, WASTE OF MONEY!Most of the packs i opened were unknown players.No big names at all=( So don't plan on purchasing.And the shipping was way to slow."
3,Do you like getting lost?,"Read Nancy's other book on Hegel, The Restlessness of the Negative. This book here is beyond difficult and obscure, probably the most incomprehensible philosophical study I've ever attempted to read and I've read a good bit of Nancy's other work and Hegel, so I'd think that I should pick something up... but it doesn't happen.It does have a picture of a big rock on the cover though which is kinda cool."
4,Perfect Price...,"It was a little bigger than I had imagined. No big deal, my fault anyway, I looked up the specs. It has good Sound. It has been in the Suburban for a week now. Not bad, Not Bad. It says 800watts max. but I can not find the actual wattage that this amp actually pushes. One thing I guess I was dissapointed with, is the terminal connectors for power, and ground. I purchased an 1800watt capable wiring kit, 4ga. wire I think? Huge wire.... wanted to make sure it would recieve all the power it may need.Well, the terminals on the unit, are ready to accept like 16ga. wire. only... seriously. kinda screwy.. seems like maybe the amp probably isn't too powerful.Oh,Well.... it completes the family suburban stereo. Its Cool. we needed some kind of bass!! I hope it lasts..."
5,A fitting conclusion,"I've been pleased with the X-Men series overall, and X-Men United is a fitting end to the trilogy. The plot is a bit far-fetched - Jean Grey being an all-powerful super mutant - but it does up the ante (including one memorable death scene). My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer - it seems as if the film is rushed in only 100 minutes. Otherwise, if you liked the first two, you'll love this one."
3,X-Men 3,"This would be a good movie IF it were not called X-Men. They have completely sabotaged the X-Men storyline from the comics. They came up with new stories, which is sometimes ok, but not here. Jean Grey is barely used, Storm looks weak and undecisive, and Scott, why did they even have him there? THe movie left too many things unexplained, changed the X-men Universe and forgot to give some depth to the characters. This is just an action film and only that. Only Wolverine saves the day and the movie."
2,CAN SOMEONE WRITE A REVIEW OF THE DVD,"I looked on this webpage for a review of the DVD and its features, not one review after another of the original theatrical release. This is not a place for reviews of movies that were in the theater--it is for reviews of the actual product listed above. I am surprised Amazon allows such on here. Please, can someone post an actual review of the DVD. Thanks."
3,Collector's Edition is a waste of money,You pay an extra $10-15 bucks for the Collector's Edition and what do you get? A lame comic book and a cardboard box that starts to fall apart the moment you open it. The DVD is exactly the same as the standard edition. There is no extra bonus material or extra disc. This is just a marketing gimick to suck more money out of you. Don't fall victim to it.
2,A dissapointing DVD for Collectors and Fans,"As a big fan of Xmen and dvd collector it was disapointing to buy this dvd with soooooo little extras. When you spend money on the more expensive versions of films you want at least SOME value for money. This only incorporates trailers, deleted scenes, commentary and marvel movie trailers (eg FF, Daredevil, Electra etc). No featurettes on how they made the film or interviews with the actors. Yes, you get a small comic with it but its not all that good IMHO.2 stars for the product not the movie.Movie 4 stars.To review dvd quality though, the picture and sound of X3 is excellent. I sat back and enjoyed it just as much as when I was in the cinema. Your surround system will sing with this movie."
2,"Utterly, utterly dissapointed","I was shocked at how ridiculous this movie was. I loved the 2nd one and thought this would be the icing on the cake, but I was actually left speechless at the end. I could find nothing to say since I was so shocked at how stupid this movie was. It was a garbled mess and felt pointless. I truly was hoping to love it but instead I got the complete opposite."
3,"Good special effects, terrible script","The government develops a cure for the mutant gene, which divides the mutant community with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) on one side and Magneto (Ian McKellan) on the other, each backed by their respective armies. What's good about it? There are tons of mutants expertly realized through spectacular special effects. It's great fun to see Beast (Kelsey Grammer), Colossus (Daniel Cudmore), Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), and others in action. What's bad about it? There are tons of mutants, which means that none of the characters are well-developed. The script is a complete mess, killing off important, classic, well-established characters in off-handed ways as if they were red-shirted security men on ""Star Trek."" So it's fun to watch, but a deeply disappointing finale to an otherwise good series."
5,X-Men 3 is very cool,X-Men the Last Stand was the best yet. you have to own this movie. I can't wait for X-Men 4 to come out in the theaters it will be good. The spin offs will be something to wait for too.
2,Very Disappointing,"I am not rating this sequel as ""horrible"", but compared to the two prequels...this story line falls FAR short. The movie itself, on it's own, I would rate 3 out of 5 stars...it has a lot of good action sequences. Otherwise, without spoiling it for you...if you do go to see it, stay until the credits are done rolling...there is one final scene."
3,Not as good as part 1 and 2 of this trilogy,"While not a horrible film, this movie lacks an element that was present for both part 1 and 2 of the X-men trilogy. This may be due to the fact that Brian Singer, who directed the first two, was not present for this project, but instead chose to helm Superman Returns. While the plot centers around tensions between the mutant and human communities, it fails to drive home the gut-wrenching dilemma of pivotal characters, who are faced with the possibility of ""curing"" their mutation. This film also attempts to loop in all previous characters, while introducing many new ones. As a result, it feels fragmented, with people disappearing with only vague mentions, then looped back in later, feeling more like watching the Saturday morning cartoon version of X-men, then a properly fleshed out feature-length film."
2,Weakest of the trilogy for sure.,"A movie like this should appeal to both fans of the comics and folks whom have never read the comics, and only know the x-men from the previous movies. I believe it fails both of these audience segments. Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of Scott's death, which then effects the lack of tension between Logan, Jean, and Scott. Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of Professor Xavier's death. Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of rogue taking the cure. Non-comics fans will be like, ""why the hell does Jean just stand there all the time? Where did all the really important characters from the previous movies go? Why does a man that just moved an entire bridge ever lose any battles? If I was this let down, how must the comic book fans feel?"""
5,Forget 4 out of 5....,This is a five out of five film. Did anyone stay until after the credits? The professor returns!If you are just one of those people who love movies then this is a great movie for you. I never read the comics but I love the movies; this one is no different.
2,Brett is no Bryan Singer!!!,"Just bad overall. Character storyline, flow of movie, horribly finished! Sorry, the first two were well done, this on just does't do the others any justice. Hated It!"
5,General Movie Goers,"Some geeks hated this movie, but it's loads of fun. This DVD will sell tons of copies!"
2,Watchable but not as good as the previous two movies in the series,"This movie was accurate based on the comics. But it just wasn't as good as the first one, which was great and the second one, which was ok. To the director's credit, he didn't have a lot to work with based on the story. Hugh Jackman wants to keep himself in great shape and the right weight for his height, according to magazines like Men's Health. But he just doesn't look right for Wolverine, like he did in the first movie. I bought it just to have all the movies in the series."
1,Before you buy,Blu-Ray version is not worth the money. Split screen sales presentation is misleading. Try standard DVD and Blu-Ray seperately on the same plasma set. See for yourself.
3,Storyline?,"The 1st and 2nd X-Men movie is really good. I am not sure about this one. But after I watched it my self, oh, maybe it is better if this movie haven't being produced yet.The storyline is poor, just rely on big special effects without clear and strong plot to make the audience go ""wow"" like they did with the 1st or 2nd.I prefer not buying it, but if you already have the 1st and 2nd dvd collection, might interesting to get it too. Just so you can complete the collection."
3,Brief X3 review,"I thought that the movie was good, though not quite as good as the first two movies. The extra scenes were absolutely disappointing, but the rest of the features were good. It was an ok DVD."
1,In all Honesty this movie sucked,"The writers of this movie wrote inspector gadget. Why did they think that they could write an xmen movie? the tacky third-grade level script was just a joke to me. The directing was just a mess, and the fact that the whole war was in an hour and a half movie, was just just disappointing. Angel was useless and just retarded, Juggernaut was just stupid, and everything in the movie was wrong. There is not one good thing i can say about this movie except for the acting. But i guess its easy to act like an idiot since thats all it looked like they had to do."
4,Great way to end trilogy,"Saw movie last night... spectacular presentation. Fight scenes are amazing, especially final battle. Personally I liked it more than first two installments. Great plot in my opinion; excellent way to end trilogy. Saw in blu-ray... yummy."
1,Dont Bother,"Dont even bother paying for or watching this film... reasons??? First of all i love the animated series and all the comics and in them SCOTT SUMMERS becomes the head of the institut and not storm. Scott also dose not die expeshally not from Jean. I was so dissaponted that they just killed scott in the begining and then it seemed like nobody even carde that he was dead or looked for him in that matter they just said 'SCOTTS DEAD"" end of it. Also i realise that Jean is powerful but wolverine killing her??? really??? Also lots of the characters are missing- Nightcrawler, Boom Boom, Emma Frost... where are they? Im hopping that this new movie X-men orogins: wolverine is a good movie or else i'll just stick to watching the animated versian of the X-Men. =)"
3,good movie Bad quality,I just got this movie on Blu-Ray and the picture was horrible its the worst Blu_Ray ive seen i hop the 1st and 2nd one look better. and yes this is the 50gb duel layer one.
2,Meh,"What can I say? This film was a huge disappointment after the first two. I wasn't expecting exactly the same, but I was not expecting it to be this bad.The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the actors and cinematography is good, the script however is awful.They throw in way too many characters, even for a fan like me, and throw get rid of key people like used Kleenex.My hope is that Bryan Singer will return and make another film to make up for this one, but it's a long shot.Not worth it."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Unfortunately not the last stand for this series, Xmen III suffers from too many characters and the fact that the screenwriters don't know what to do with them--the reasonable heights reached in the previous 2 movies aren't approached and the viewer is left disappointed."
4,Logical? No. Fun? Yes!!!,"This was an excellent ending to a terrific series, and worthy of all the hype it's generated so far. Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan put forth strong performances as Wolverine and Magneto, and the rest of the performers, with the exception of the actors playing Cyclops and Rogue, are believable in spite of the roles they are playing. The time passes quickly in the movie, and it is well-worth a second viewing. There are a lot of intense scenes, and some gruesome deaths."
3,It's okay at best,"The weakest from the original X-men trilogy, I didn't like how they did the phoenix. They should've did it in outerspace like in the comic books and the cartoon. It's not the actors fault I'm mostly criticizing the story and the whole anti-climatic battle towards the end. There are a couple things I did like though, like after Professor X is killed Magneto showed some respect for him. Ask for Wolverine he's just badass that's all I've got to say about him."
3,Only if you are a big fan,"Decent plot, great effects as usual. I liked it. I hope there is another one in the series. Lot of changes in this one, so we'll see."
3,On par,I see this movie as being on par with the rest of the series. The ending was a surprise but if you want to continue a franchise that's what you have to do. I would say that it's not a waste of money to buy and it has a fair to moderate redemption for entertainment value.
4,Very Good,This is the best one of all three. even though i dont like what they did to rouge's character or the fact that they didnt have gambit. Other than that it was great.
2,disappointing -- especially for the x-men fans!,"If you have read (and enjoyed) any of the X-men, save your $, buy the graphic novel of the original dark Phoenix saga, and pretend this movie wasn't made. If you want to see some special effects & aren't that hung up on character development, I'd still just rent it."
2,Fun fluff,"Probably not worth buying on DVD, but as a rental (actually saw it in the theater) it is just fine or as my friend would say: ""fun fluff"".Not being a consumer of the comics, I am not prejudiced to what may or may not have been included in the storyline. As a movie buff, I have to say the effort here was poor to fair. There are just some things that make no sense. Why Alcatraz Island? Why does the winged one escape and only reappear to save his father? Why ARE their so many characters in each film? Why was Halle Barry brought back as Storm, at least in a somewhat pivotal role? Why did the producers even hint that there might be a sequel? Why?!To be honest, I only ever saw the three X-Men films because my friend is an X-Men fan."
1,Sad and pathetic ending to a great series,"My god this movie stunk, at least compared to the first two movies anyway. This movie is worse than the worst of the x-men cartoons in plot, characterization and just plain fun. I'm sure they spent lots of money on this movie, too bad they didn't spend more of it on the script and the director. And it is obvious that the movie was ""hacked"" together, when the scene on the Golden Gate Bridge starts, it is the middle of the day, the next minute they are at Alcatraz and suddenly it is midnight. But the worse thing they did is the destruction of the characters, not just the ones they killed off, but how they changed them. I wished I'd never watched this movie, it took characters that I liked and made them detestable, weak, stupid, etc., etc."
1,"terrible, violent and demonic","I liked the first two x men but not this one. It is super violent and shocking. I would have given this movie an Rrating. Jean Grey/Phoenix is almost a demonic character which I found horrible. Yes there were some good moments,and some good performances by the actors but not enough to save this movie."
3,X-Men - The Last Stand (Collector's Edition),"Not a bad movie in itself and good for individuals not familiar with the xmen history comic or other, I also found this X men to have a week plot but has a good story line. So would I watch it yes would I buy it again no."
3,everything is written,no surprise ... good effects ... the rise and fall of Jean Grey ...just making us wait for the next ... if there is one ... and we all know the story ...
4,Great finish to this franchise.,"Well done finish to a fine franchise. Teaser ending suggests more may be coming but if not, this closes things down nicely."
3,Not a good way to end it,"I'm not going to talk about how I think the director should stick to comedy (or nothing at all). Of the trilogy, this one had the least amount of acting and character development. The special effects, although great, do not a great movie make. Focusing more on storm was not a bad idea, but I've never been a huge fan of Berry's acting. The casting decision for Beast and the makeup were very well done. The movie just tries to do to much in a short amount of time. Characters die, and I find myself scratching my head ""I should probably be feeling something right now. Am I sad? Angry at their death? Dah well."" One character dies and you really don't even know it, as it isn't shown, and it is very little referenced until a grave stone at the end."
2,X Men,"Not my favorite by any means. Left you hanging at the end and not in a good way, like wanting to rush out and see the next one."
3,X-Men: The Last Stand,"X-Men 3 was one of the best films of this year. It had great action and CGI and alot of new characters were brought in and they were very cool. The only disappointments were that it definetly was not long enough. It was only 1 hour and 45 minutes long when, for a final film, it should have been 2 and a half hours. It was also to bad Bryan Singer didn't direct this one, I think leaving the last one for someone else, especially Brett Ratner, was a mistake. He is directing Superman Returns though, so at least he left the X-Men series to work on another comic film. The last problem with this one was that a few characters I was really looking forward to seeing was Beast and Angel. Beast got alot of screen time, but Angel barely had any. That was disappointing. But other than ALL of that, it was a good movie."
2,Movie was rushed and superficial,"I lurved the first two x-men movies, and I love the whole francise. What could go wrong?First of all, most of the new mutants introduced were pathetic, Juggarnaught didn't really work, angel existed just to swoop down and prove his father wrong, and that fast chic was just there to distract storm from the fact that she had no plot written for her.Really the problem is this movie was abandoned. The original X-men director went away to do Superman Returns (so he could film an actor who looked like Mr Rieves R.I.P lift things)Whoever the new guy just couldn't seem to create scenes that worked. Every poignant moment in the film felt rushed and the actors were about as emotional as sim's.I recommend watching X-2 twice instead of this"
2,Stick to the Comics,I was disappointed with this movie. If they knew the comic book version they would have done a better job with this movie.
2,I regret having bought it.,"I am a true fan of the X-Men series. The second movie was dynamic and I was very excited at the prospect of seeing the ""Last Stand."" Now I regret having bought it. The plot is transparent and monotonous. I was especially disappointed with the special effects. In this age of technological advance, I would expect the effects to provide a spectacular visual experience, but they did not even come close. Great movies are memorable. Even good ones leave us with a ""takeaway"" message. They inspire the audience to move forward and yet to always remember that one line or that one character or that one scene. This movie possesses none of those qualities. If you want to see mundane science fiction, this movie is for you, but if you expect the quality of the previous movies in the X-Men series, you will be sorely disappointed."
1,X-men has lost some steam,"Just to let you know that Brett Ratner messed up the X-men saga. This hack director decided that the movie did not need a story-line and shot it anyways. Don't waste your time with this movie instead watch a real excellent comic book "" Superman Returns""."
1,Waste of time.,"Even the people on here who are giving this movie a less than stellar review are being too kind to this flick. Yes, we are all X-Men fans and we wanted to like this film but let's face it: This sucked. I hate sitting there after a movie and realizing that some dumb schmuck director just stole two hours of my time. Others have said what's wrong with the film but have gone easy on it. I won't. Don't waste your time. This director owes us a do-over."
1,Lousy blu ray,"Hey, why did you ship me a blu ray with a broken case. How are you expecting me to keep the blu ray, very disappointing on your act."
2,Weak Sequel.,"The kill off two main vital characters from the last two films, cram in too many new characters, rely on CGI effects too much, and leave it with a dumb ending. I do not know weather to give it 2 or 2.5 stars, because it is watchable, but not something that I would really like to watch again. I would not recomend this unless you are a diehard fan."
4,X3-What would Bryan Singer do?,"When watching the third X Men movie, one cannot help but wonder if Bryan Singer was involved in the movie.Brett Ratner does a credible job on his contribution to a movie franchise that Singer defined.The movie is loaded with great action sequences,new characters,plot twists and and resolutions.Unfortunately at 105 minutes it crams in too much when an over two hour screen time would better service under developed elements(The Phoenix,and the off-screen death of a beloved X-Men)and characters(Angel,Beast,Juggernaught,Rogue).The endings leaves the door open for this not to be the ""Last"" stand of the cinimatic adventure of the X-Men."
4,Never liked X-men,"I don't really like the theme of X-men of comparing these people with special abilities to Jews in Nazi Germany as they are different.Having said that, this story is probably the best one of the lot. The acting was good. The story flowed quite well. The action scenes were interesting."
4,Don't mind the bad reviews; it's a good movie.,"Citizen Kane this is not, but it's still a very entertaining, action packed, thrill ride with great special effects, decent characters, and a pretty good story. I notice that most of the negative reviews are from comics fans who can't stand how their favorite characters were treated in this movie. Well, this is the movie, not the comic series. And this manages to be a very entertaining film. It has its flaws, such as Storm inexplicably losing the accent she had for the first two movies, and the occasional bit of cheesy dialogue, but it's good entertainment, and people who are not dead set on having the comic characters exactly represented on screen will not find much to complain about."
4,The Last Stand,"Great move! Plenty of action and have one of the best action scene. Great movie on blu-ray with spectacular graphics and sound. Make sure you have enough nacho's and popcorn, because the ending leaves you at the end of your seat. I definitely recommend this movie in your blu- ray collection."
2,Script problems--don't blame the actors!,"This latest installment of the X-men saga made me feel like I was getting in after the movie had already started. A vital ingredient was missing--a central character whose development was key to the plot. There were a lot of characters but we really didn't spend much time with any one of them.The result was a somewhat flat action film. Yes, there was a struggle that needed to be resolved but it really was not amplified enough. The ongoing metaphor of mutants as the marginalized citizens of our society still worked. The action scenes were fine, we just were not made to care a lot about how things resolved. Too bad--many talented actors put time into this movie. With a little script tweaking it could have suceeded!"
2,Bryan Singer should have directed,"Bryan Singer should have stayed and directed X-Men - The last stand; this last installment was a major disappointment. After seeing Superman Returns, which was directed by Bryan Singer, I was really disappointed. Mr. Singer should have stayed with the X-Men franchise which was his forte."
3,"As with Alien, the third time was not the charm.","There are deaths. The first, early on, in a throw-away scene that was confusing and could have been cut from the movie without anyone noticing. The BIG death scene was so badly done it had none of the emotional impact it should have had.Special effects were good, Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen were good, Halle Berry had demanded more screen time in this movie and did nothing with it. Ian McKellen was great, the best thing in the movie.If Brian Singer had stayed with the film it could have been the best of the series. Instead it was a great disappointment.Lastly, I'd like to lodge a complaint. My wife is handicapped and when a movie is over my prime concern is to get her back to the car. Obviously we missed this ""extra scene"". And each comment I read about how ""cool"" the scene was, it just pisses me off. Another reason for me to dislike Ratner."
1,are you people kidding me?,this movie is a disgrace.SPOILER warningWhy do they think they could get away with killing Dr X? no. thats wrong. he doesnt die ESPECIALLY CYCLOPS he never dies in the comics or the tv show? this movie makes no sense.especially when they use THREE darts to take out magneto instead of saving one for jean grey. she wouldnt have had to die. and neither would the series.
5,this movie rules,"X-Men 3 is very cool. this movie is bursting with non-stop action. although it is inaccurate from the cartoon's content, I still enjoyed it. I thought Kelsey Grammer was the perfect person to play Hank ""Beast"" McCoy as he is just as intelligent. they ought to have more characters from the cartoon series, such as Sabretooth and Toad, on a possible 4th movie. the movie had a bit of nudity in it, and that was when Mystique was hit with a ""cure"" dart and turned into a normal woman, but there was no frontal nudity involved."
5,Awesome Action! MUST SEE!!,"Awesome action and suspense! Lots of special effects, visuals, everything!! HIGHLY Recommended!!A great powerful ending to the X-Men trilogy."
5,X-Men The Last Stand,This movie was the best out of the series and i am proud to own this Stan Lee collectors edition.It is worth the money
3,defective product,"This product was received in the ""shape"" as promised; however, when I viewed the movie, it paused, froze up and upon review of the item when I removed it from my dvd player it appeared to have some scratches. The product was new I removed all the protective coverings myself; however, the product was defective."
2,Out with a thud,"In the closer to this series it is very anti-climatic. I understood what they were trying to do, but they failed horribly. As most movie series go, usually the movie squels they make the quality goes down, which was what happened in this case. It would be a good watch and purchase if you want the entire collection, but don't expect anything great. Saddened."
2,Plotless action movie with noise being the only tension.,"I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I liked seeing the characters again. There is absolutely no bothering to sustain story or credibility. To wit: the most powerful mutant, a class 5, who can shred matter with her mind, and evaporate entire (large) lakes in fit of steamy passion is killed by a (Wolverine's) large salad fork. Disappointing. Expensive. Dumb."
1,Abysmally bad,"This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. You watch it expecting to see the XMen do something cool - something fitting with the plot and characters set up in the first two movies. Instead, you're abused by a three hour long foray into bad acting, horrible dialogue, and the quick and pathetic destruction of just about everything that made the first two movies great. Do yourself a favor and forget this movie ever happened. I gave this movie 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option. I'd say it was the worst movie ever, but I already gave Matrix Revolutions that distinction, so let's say this is the second worst ever, or the worst movie to end a trilogy after an amazingly good first two films."
3,Okay Sci-Fi,"X-Men The Last Stand is a good Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi movie. The special effects are pretty interesting.And I can see how Ian McKellen can go around saying that this is a movie he personally relates to.Even though I really like Sci-Fi, and I have seen the previous X-Men movies, I am really not an expert on X-Men.Basically, the Mutants are fighting for their right to remain Mutants. A ""cure"" has been discovered and they don't wantto be forced to take the Cure.But the only character I could sympathize with was Angel, played by Ben Foster. This was really the only character in themovie that had any emotional depth.Even in a sci-fi movie, I like to have some sense of who the characters are.The scenes where the Mutants are fighting are pretty good, and with good special effects.And Of course, there is always Hugh Jackman - who is so good looking whatever role he is playing."
2,"I'd rather spend the evening with my ""X"" girlfriend!","I'm sorry, maybe my expectations were too high-but this movie sucks. Every scene feels chopped, like what we were supposed to see was about to happen, but we never quite got there. The extablished characters do not grow and the plethora of new characters are unnecessary. The beloved ""fast ball special"" sequence was lamer than I thought possible. Kelsey Grammar was wasted as Beast, and the power of Phoenix was not used or explained to satisfaction. I liked the first movie, loved the second, and was absolutely heart-broken by this third; more like a train wreck than an adventure film. If none of the action is believable, none of the humor is funny, and none of the conflict satisfying, then why even make this mess? I sure hope Spidey 3 doesn't blow it this hard!"
2,Mutants have magical abilities.,"The plot didn't fit in my mode of thinking....if genetically someone is a mutant, how does that explain the physical impossiblily of flying around or turning your body into ice or walking through walls? It doesn't, so why base being a mutant on genetics? It's more accurate to say they actually have magical powers. Anyway, the film was mostly devoid of any real emotion and the actors seemed to just be there because they had to be. Jean is rarely seen struggling with her Phoenix counterpart. I remember the animated series having a more exciting Phoenix. Some of the mutants were just thrown together it seems and their powers were so lame(porcupine). Magneto's helmut looked completely silly and cumbersome. I wish there were more battles featuring the powers of the mutants."
2,X-Yawn,"thinly veiled cultural insights into society's response to homosexuals, minorities, and terrorists will only get you so far. i fell asleep somewhere b/w the fifth melodramatic speech about mutant rights and the part where patrick stewart dies. i woke up three hours later in the middle of a nacho libre preview. if i want to get lectured for two hours and watch bad cgi i'll visit Holy Land. damn you brett ratner."
2,GAD!!!!!,"Oh,my god! This was a raelly StupiedX100 Movie.CAST:3/10STORY:10/10S/F:3/10OVERALL:3/10RECS:Spider man,X-men,DD,Elextera,Hulk,and FF"
1,What the heck was this?,"I absolutely love the X-men. I've followed them all my life... some 35 years. I've watched all the different X-men cartoons on TV. That's why I hate to say that I'm horribly dissapointed with this movie. This story completely ignored the cartoon plot or anything I know about Phoenix. They killed 3 of the superheroes, all of who died for no good reason. The movie felt like I was watching friends get murdered. I'm going to watch Xmen I and II and pretend like Xmen 3 was never made."
2,"Weak movie, bad TiVo ""unbox"" download","We downloaded this to try out the new ""Amazon Unbox"" service for TiVo owners. The 105-minute movie took about 5 hours to download over DSL. The video quality was pretty awful -- any horizontal panning flickered badly, and there was a lot of that here. Relatively still scenes were fine.Other reviewers have explained the movie's faults pretty well. It had the fanciest special effects of any in the series, but little of the charm. Easily my least favorite of the X-Men movies."
4,X-Men The Last Stand Blu-Ray,"I had read a lot of different reviews of the Blu-ray disc, some good, some bad. After watching it myself I can say the picture can look grainy at times but it appears to be the way it was originally produced. That aside i would much rather have this movie on blu-ray than DVD. I've seen the DVD version and it is much worse. The grainy texture does not distract from the movie what so ever though."
4,X-Men - The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition),"A good X-Men movie, not as good as the 1st movie, but better than the 2nd movie. The choice of main movie characters has always seemed odd to me, and this continues in Last Stand. At least Rogue plays a very small roll in Last Stand - which is good because she is one of the weakest characters ever!! Overall tho, Last Stand is a fine finish(?) to the X-Men trilogy."
3,4 Stars for the movie--1 star for this DVD edition,"I couldn't figure out why this so called ""Collector's Edition"" only had one disc. Special editions usually have two discs, right? Was it a typo? No.The ONLY difference between this edition and the regular edition (that is $8 cheaper!) is that there will be a reprinted comic and a special ""collectible"" comic included. So collectible that it will be included in the hundreds of thousands of these DVDs produced. No extra features, no additional content beyong what is in the regular DVD. The studio is obviously saving all that for another special edition to be released in 6 months (like X-Men 1.5).Unless you're a huge fan of comics, get the regular release and save the money for Superman Returns on November 28th."
4,2nd disk,"The second disk is just a DVD-ROM containing the digital copy, it won't play in a DVD player (I tested it just to answer your questions). And just in case you're wondering, it's DRM protected."
1,Crappy ending to the X-Men series,"Brett Ratner screwed up with this movie. If Bryan Singer had stayed with X-Men instead of moving to the horrible Superman movie, it would have been better. And who gave Ratner the right to bring X-Men to an end. I can say a whole list of things wrong with this movie. First off, Professor Xavier and Cyclops die. That's not supposed to happen. Beast was only in this one, so technically he was only in one X-Men of the whole series even if he is a major character in the X-Men series. All in all, this movie was a complete failure with to much CGI. Don't leave any comic book movies to Brett Ratner."
2,"Movie is great, but don't bother with the Collector's Edition!","As a DVD collector, I was more than willing to fork over the extra ten dollars to pick up the X-Men: The Last Stand Collector's Edition. Unforntunately, I have never been more disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the movie is pretty good, and worth picking up, but the Collector's Edition is definitely not worth the money. The only difference between it and the regular widescreen version is a fancy box and a mini-comic book. No extras, no special features disc, nothing. Really, who would pay ten bucks for a comic book? Don't let the pretty packaging fool you; the regular version has all the same material on it as the collector disc. I hope this will help someone save a little money."
2,X MEN: THE LAST DUD,"X Men 3What can I say, the negative reviews were right. I really wanted to like this movie. The first and second were excellent. But much like Blade Trinity, this was a huge let down. Where to begin?1. The movie was only about an hour and a half long.2. There were too many characters introduced.3. They were all very generic, only there to service the plot (Multiple man is a perfect example).4. No character development to speak of, even from the returning cast.5. The plot was promising but extremely thin and almost non existent.6. The use (or lack of use, rather) of the Phoenix was embarrassing.7. The action was a bit over the top.8. ""The Last Stand"" was very disappointing, if you catch my double meaning.Why bother going any further, I think I made my point. I just hope Brett ""Rush Hour"" Ratner isn't involved in any of the spinoffs. On a good note, I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD, but only to complete the set."
4,Great movie!,I love these X-Men movies. I just saw X-Men First Class in the theater and it didn't disappoint. My favorite is Wolverine Origins. Hugh Jackman is incredible!
5,From a non comic Fan,Hardcore fans in any genera are Very hard to please same goes for this movie.i don't know much about comics apart from xmen names and what i see in movies or cartoons.i absoluately loved action and fast paced story with three sides to choice from that'll be X men against each other and human in mix as army .SPOILER finally some good and bad main X men characters are killed in this movie that is solely reason i chosen it to be part of my collection..Its something very rarely done as no studio wants to end well established fan fav character .i witnessed this action in Superman Apocalypto too and kudos to all team for it.Blu ray sound is 6.1 DTS is excellant though in couple of scenes there is grain and CGI is spot on .You should watch deleted scenes after movie .They help explaining jean behaviour..i didn't know at time of order but this is two disc edition second Disc being just documentry of xmen trilogy.Both disc have xmen pic rather then just title name and its good thing.
2,Boring Boring Boring,"I loved the first two films, but they blew it big time with this bomb. From cliche lines like ""What the...?"" to Halle Berry's consistently wooden performance (the woman might be pretty but she couldn't act her way out of a speeding ticket) this movie might be worth renting, but you probably would never want to see it twice. Worse than bad, it's just strangely boring. Major characters are killed and we just don't care. Blame the director and Hollywood's catering to talentless Halle. I'm hawking my DVD to the second-hand bin first chance I get."
3,NOTE: (At Least) 2 DIFFERENT Collector's Editions out there!,Everyone's either seen the movie or read the reviews so gonna skip thatBUTThought everyone might like to know that one of Amazon's ... **distinguished competition** (one whose name could be used as a synonym for daredevil's enemy bullseye!) is selling a VARIANT collector's edition(that is NOT labelled as the stan lee collector's edition) which comes in a collector's tin and with a reprint of giant size x-men #1 and set of x-men movie trading cards INSTEAD of the regular package and stan lee comic.the tin's really cool looking but did we really need ANOTHER reprint ofgiant size?hope the stan lee comic starts turning up on ebay soon!-adolfokyliedawg@aol.com
3,"""A let Down""","If they make another after this It better pick up all the slack in this one, this was bad, not horrible, but bad."
5,Best of the 3?,"Ok I can agree on a few things. The added chars did little. Jeans Rez is part of the comics and i thought it translated pretty well to the movie and added some great Unpredictability. Personally i thought this was the best of the 3 because you never knew exactly What was going to happen. I dont want to spoil it for anyone who is going to watch it, but as I said, I think it's the best of the 3 movies."
3,Xmen,"I would like to give this one star or, if possible, no stars, but they put a lot of work into making this movie and gave it an honest effort. this seems to me a movie that probably looked really good on the drawing board, but that didn't come together well on screen. Wihtout spoiling it, I'll tell you I laughed when a certain carachter died in the movie instead of caring one iota. I think you can watch this movie and let your mind vegetate, but other than that it's not worth much. The only thing that keeps it out of the B-movie slot is the good acting, the hottie women, and things blowing up."
3,Least of the three,"Of the three movies in the sequel, this one I would rank as the worst. It felt like the producers were in a hurry to come to some sort of a conclusion. The portrayal of Jean Gray as the burgeoning Pheonix was weak and this terminal act was too succinct in it's development. I also thought that the mutant powers went way over the top compared to what they had been previously. Overall, an average sci-fi / superhero movie.I will say, however, that because I loved the comic book series and the cartoon, I still hold a special place for this whole trilogy. If you are like me, buy it. If you're not sure, rent it."
5,I like it because it is darker than the other two,"I have the first two so I had to have the latest one for the collection. I do like the movie, it is darker and even more ""mature"" than the first two. If you are looking for the meaning of life in movies then you really need to seek help, this is just a movie that will entertain if you let it, nothing else."
2,How Could They????,"I can't believe the ego that it must have taken to manipulate the XM universe this way. I can't believe they killed Xavier, Scott (Cyclops), and Jean, nullified the powers of Rogue, Magneto, and Mystique, (none of whom would choose that in the XM universe I know and love), and to not include a character (and a budding romance) for Gambit (with Rogue, of course). Bobby can have Kitty - that was one of the rare scenes I liked. I also liked the Kitty/Juggernaut scene near the end, and it's scenes like that that made me give it even a 2. Lastly, what the heck was wrong with Hugh's hair through most of this movie? It looked terrible - nothing like how good it looked in the previous two movies."
2,Ratner is a hack.,"They took what was potentially a very compelling storyline and then gave it to Brett Ratner. He capitalized off of the popularity of Singer's work on the previous two and then took the story and character development absolutely nowhere. It was a decent watch, though very disappointing, considering what it could have been. Though the previous two weren't classics, they were definitely better done and more interesting than this one ended up being."
1,Stan Lee's endorsement has no value now,"This is the worst possible concept that I have encountered in all my years of following the X-Men. I am so disgusted with the directors ""vision"" that I can not even embrace the few good aspects that did surface. If the movie had been about topics that were not already defined I would not have been as disappointed but it USED the Pheonix theme but with a totally unacceptable change of story line.Jean Grey became the Pheonix due to alien intervention and challenges. SHE WAS NOT MENTALLY UNBALANCED DUE TO HER POWERS. Also, killing off Xavier after only 3 movies only proves that the director had nothing in mind but making a name for himself because he sure didn't produce a product that X-Men fans can embrace.I can only hope that, as with the Superman movies, the next X-Men movie will carry on as if this one was never made."
2,Collector's Edition Review,"This was a waste of money. Unless you really love fancy packaging and simply cannot live without the new comic book by Stan Lee (it's drawn like the originals), then you can go ahead and get this.Most of the deleted scenes will leave you scratching your head. There were a couple that I just don't know how they didn't make the cut. The rest are simply fillers, and I actually felt the money being stolen from me as I was watching them.THE ALTERNATE ENDINGS ARE NOT ENDINGS. They are post credit endings, that would replace or go along with the original. They last just as long. When I heard that this had THREE alternate endings, I couldn't wait to buy it. Man was I dissapointed.I love the movie, but this is just about the most well produced and presented [..] I have seen. Get the regular version, you're not missing anything with this."
2,Worse of the Series,"Brett Ratner screwed this up royally. My biggest problem with the film...Wolverine was TAME!!!! And that is enough to hate this movie. Cyclops always got the short end of the stick in this series of films, and he really had absolutely no point in this one. Jean Gray's death should have sparked Wolverine into further isolation, and hurt Cyclops, but not make him as distant as he became in this film. And what about the Colussus vs. Juggernaut battle? That was just screaming to occur in this film. And Angel? No point in the film. Saves daddy at the end and that's it. And why...why....kill Professor X. And the ending...I thought that I was going to see Hugh Jackman break out into a musical number as Angel swooped over the mountains. I wish Bryan Singer remakes X-Men 3, and I hope the planned Wolverine film kicks [...]."
1,Are you people INSANE?,"Are you people INSANE? This movie was an insult to everything produced in the first 2 movies. This movie was worse than Godfather III, Ghostbusters II or even the new Star Wars trilogy. This film made me want to roll up in a little ball and cry myself to death. I have never felt a film could be so terrible and even insulting before. This movie changed my outlook on going to movies simply to get out and watch a movie with a tub of popcorn. I can't DO THAT ANYMORE. I am so traumatized by XIII that I have to read RottenTomatoes and Flixter and ask multiple people who've watched it bc I don't ever want to be conned again. What kind of person can give this movie 5 stars? Are you being paid by the producers? Was the porcupine mutant so impressive that you jumped out of your seat and cheered when he hugged the scientist?Disgusting!!"
3,Pretty good ....BUT ?,"This was pretty good film.It is easy to see alot of work went into it....BUT... something just does not ""click""....and I don't know exactly what it is.It almost feels like everybody is walking thru the scenes as visualized in the storyboards, but in a ""mechanical"" sort of way if that makes any sense.Unlike some DVDs you eiher want to buy and add to your collection, or at least talk/think about afterwards... X-Men 3 came across as 110 minutes of good entertainment that you forget about as soon as it goes back in the Blockbuster rental case."
4,Decent,"A worthy sequel in my opinion and no where near as bad as the critics would have you believe! Far superior than ""The Fantastic 4"" for example. Perhaps it isn't as good as X - Men 2 but I rate it higher than the first movie and it follows on from X-Men 2 very well."
2,Great... if you are clueless about the X-men,"They've completely ruined the trilogy by making this film. The Phoenix kills 3 of the most important X-men and adds a bunch of fake ones? Great idea. Let's alienate the fan base that made the first two films a hit and go for that Barb Wire demographic. Um, no. Bad idea. They made Juggernaut a mutant and he goes along with the program... have the producers/writers/director ever read an X-men comic? People that have seen the movie that didn't know about the story seemed to enjoy it. I hope this kind of crap doesn't happen to the Spiderman series or the next of the Batman Begins films. Hollywood always seems to ruin what we love... just give them time. The original Batman movie was good... then a few movies later the biggest piece of crap ever made, Batman Forever, arrives. Will you guys ever learn?"
3,A Hottt One...BUT...,"For the record, the X-Men trilogy is among my favorite superhero movie collections. X-Men and X-Men United were dreams come to life...as was X-Men:The Last Stand. However...as a comic book purist,I have to agree with some of the other posts and say that X3 was a bit disappointing. Not that the action wasn't there, not that the suspense and the romance weren't there, definately not that the special fx weren't there...but I wasn't feeling the way major characters got killed off in the end, and even more agitating is the way the film ended in light of the fact that there's supposedly NOT going to be an X4. Questions are left unanswered about Phoenix and the characters she disintegrated and all we're left with is anticipation for the Wolverine spin-off and the rumored Magneto spin-off to the X-Men trilogy. Could've been a lot better."
2,Not worth the extra money!,"When I picked this up I did not realize that the only difference that this edition had was the added comic. The comic is a cute concept about Stan Lee meeting X-Men characters, but is not worth the extra money and I doubt that it would ever become a collector's item. I had hoped that there were more extras than that for the added money, but sadly no. So stick with the movie editions."
2,"Story is good, directing is bad",I love the X-men series and the story and acting in The Last Stand are good. Unfortunately you can really tell that they used a new director. It's too bad because of the three movies this was my least favorite. Not a great way to end things. I wish I hadn't gone opening weekend; the amount they grossed gives the film too much credit.
5,Bryan who?,"When it was announced that Brett Ratner would be directing X3, there was a massive outcry from the comic book nerds saying he would RUIN the X-Men franchise. Well, those nerds can eat their words now because Ratner's X-Men is so fantastic that it doesn't even compare to Singer's films. Singer did a pretty good job. But Ratner's film IS X-Men. He presents these characters the way they were always meant to be. What's great about this film? Story, acting, action, special effects, you name it. Ratner gets it done right. I actually teared up in a scene near the end. This movie is just perfect.I heard this will be the last X-Men film. That's a shame because this franchise is better than ever."
4,The Ending ***No Spoilers***,"This installment of X-Men doesn't quite live up to the second one, which is, indeed the best of the three. Angel has two or three lines and his powers are used one time in the whole film, Juggernaut is just a tad bit more than a cameo and the freak mutants that team up with Magneto are completely annoying. However, on the plus side, we do see Magneto move the entire Golden Gate Bridge, Kelsey Grammer does an amazing job with Beast and Jean Grey/Phoenix will scare the hell out of you. Keep your eyes open at the end right after Wolverine's shot on the balcony of the mansion for the best ending to any superhero film. All I'll say is this final scene is pure gold and will almost frighten you. I can not get the image of it out of my head. If you like the first two, you will like this one, however, like I said before, it didn't measure up to the second one."
3,Personally I was dissapointed,"3 movies and you start killing everyone off already? Come on! Sorry for the spoiler, for those of you who don't know the story yet, but if you don't, save your money."
2,X Men The Last Stand,This copy did not have all the extras associated with a DVD. The movie was good but I missed all the extra screens and stuff.
4,Overall this movie is...,"So I went to see this movie on opening day with some friends and I came away satisfied. I saw it for the second time, but I wasn't excited that some characters were nowhere to be found (Nightcrawler) and others were cast aside early on into the movie (Cyclops & Mystique).Though some characters did get decent and meaningful deaths (Professor X & Jean) the deaths still felt unneeded.This week I wasn't feeling to great and was trying to find something to watch that I hadn't already seen a hundred times and I picked X-men 3. I turned on the movie expecting that an hour and forty-eight minutes of my life would be wasted. Luckily I was wrong.Sure this movie isn't the best movie ever, but by no means is it the worst movie ever. It's a fun action movie; if you're looking for a deep, emotional story then this won't be your cup of tea, but if you're looking to get away for awhile and just have some fun then this movie is definitely worth the rental price."
4,X-Men - The Last Stand,"A fitting end to the series, though full of unexpected twists. The deaths of both Xavier and Cyclops, transformation of Mystique, the choice made by Rogue: never saw these coming.Wolverine and Storm played a large role in the final outcome, though they had to lead from the front as all others were either dead or beginning their careers.It will be interesting to see how the Wolverine spin-offs work, and just where Storm is headed - taking overthe school or still standing with Wolverine and the others. Question is against what?"
4,wow!,"'Last Stand' certainly is an appropriate title for this film. Like the first two movies, canon is altered, making Jean Grey's Phoenix force a dark part of her subconscious rather than a separate entity like in the comic series. Still, it is a pretty cool movie and the storyline is different from the others, so this movie doesn't feel like a rehash."
5,love the ending.,one of the most epic endings ever. The scene with magneto and the chess board...love this series. Best comic book movies by far. I just ordered the BD version. I cant wait to see it.
4,I hated it - Then I loved it!,At first I didn't like the fact that Bryan Singer wasn't at the helm for this one but then I found out he was busy making Superman Returns. I watched it a few more times and I found my hate slowly oozing away from my heart. Now I cant get enough to this day. Im still hooked!...
4,Good Collection for a great price!,"I bought XMen 1.5 , Xmen 2 and the last stand for less than 5$ each in a lighting deal and the print was amazing! Worth watching in HDTV...worth every penny. 4-star is for movie and 5-star for price. I love amazon!"
4,XMEN the Last Stand,"After trying to buy this DVD from all over New Zealand i was rapt to be able to purchase it through Amazon.com. Service is amazing and very eficient.arrived well within the time frame suggested and plays well in Full Screen mode.Infact i was able purchase it cheaper, comparably to other DVD's, in my own country !thank you"
4,"3.5 stars not the best of the three, but you can find entertainment here","ok comic adaptation.great new characters.the new director did his best but not enough to compare him with ""singer"" the director of the first two movies. you will miss the latter,s movie magic in the second part of the movie. stan lee_the creator of the x men comics_ got a lovely cameo here in the begining.a must see for fans of the franchise.you can feel the strong performance of hugh jackman .the others done good also specialy ian and stewart. i hope you enjoy the show."
2,Too Much Teenage Angst,"I thought the first two movies in the series were pretty great. Yes we know that most of the mutants start to have problems when their powers manifest around puberty, but most of the tragedy of being a teenager was pushed to the background in favor of the plot and the struggle between Dr. Xavier and Magneto and the philosophies they were trying to instill in their adherents. This last one though, was way too cheesy. Let's put as many special effects in as we can, focus on as much teenage angst as we can, and then have a big fight scene at the end, with Keley Grammar in blue fur. Pass please."
3,"The movie gets 5 stars, but this package gets less","I thought this package was going to have some extra features on the DVD or a second disc like the ""Batman Begins"" special edition did, but instead I got the regular edition DVD and paid ten extra dollars for a stupid comic book. Shouldn't a collector's edition have more than a comic book? Especially with the ten dollar difference in price.If you want X-3, skip this version. If you want X-3 and a comic book, skip this version, buy the regular version and buy your comics at a comic book store, where the comics are better than the one you get with this package."
3,X-Men: The Trainwreak,"I saw X-Men3 last night. I enjoyed the acting and directing. But the movie it self turn into a trainwreak to soon. I hoped ""Superman Return"" is the best superhero film of the summer."
3,This Blu-Ray not much better than regular DVD,"Best of the X-men films and I have almost every X-Men comic ever printed. Now onto this blu-ray transfer. Ive only had a blu-ray player a short time and have the ten free movies it came with. This is the only one of the ten that only uses the single layer 25g space. This was most certainly rushed to blue-ray to cash in on X-mas shoppers. The sound is exactly the same as the collectors edition DVD!! The picture is a little better. This I would not buy if you already have the regular dvd because the way this player (Sony S-300) upscales you barely notice. Shame on Fox for this one, they did a good job on Fantastic Four/ Surfer blu-ray though."
4,great,i think this was the best movie of them all. they could had did more but it was still good for the end. they should make another one.
2,I expected more from Philllips,"Teerible tv. It has a terrible picture. I bought this tv a couple of weeks ago and I dislike it. The day I got it I happy because I have very little to do in my small college room, it was ok the first day, then the next day the tv did not respond. I changed the channal and it took 5 seconds before it respond, the 20 seconds before the sound came out. The voulme it took 10 seconds before the volume changed. I had to unplug it for it to work again. I am not the only one 3 of my friends bought this same tv and they have the same problems I was the only one who bought it online the rest in a retail store. I think it is ok it is only for college but if I had bought it for my home then I would have return it, the other person to rate this pruduct says this tv is a good one i think it is terrible, I did not gave this tv a one becuase it was sufficiently good to keep.But don't buy if you are planning to get a tv. I wish now that some one would have advice me this."
5,This Book is Genius,"If you've been going in circles on you're quest to figure out the human condition read this book now! It cleared up so many of the missing links. Thank you is all I can say, it showed up exactly when I needed it!"
2,Poor Quality,"Purchased this for my husband for Christmas last year - it needed to be replaced by August after 8 months of use. It does get used almost daily, but still...expected better shelf life than this."
3,Entertaining horror/comedy from the 80s,"I actually saw this movie when it first came out in theatres over 10 years ago. I disliked horror flicks immensely, but found myself really enjoying this movie. The ending is so good and such a surprise. I enjoyed the heck out of it, even with some of the corny jokes and unbelievable gags. It scares you, makes you laugh, and keeps you guessing. It is a little outdated now, but I think most of it will still entertain."
3,Avrage slasher with a great ending (note would give it 3.5),"Muffy was born on April Fools Day, for her 18th birthday she desides to invite a few frinds over to her house that is on an island. Muffy has loads of april fools pranks get up everywhere over her huge house. The next day her friends seem to be going missing, is it just April Fools jokes or is there something more sinister at work. April Fools Day is a fun slasher film made by the people of Friday The 13th Part 1-6. The movie is fun and it is one of those must see twice movies. The ending is actully quite good I enjoyed the whole movie but it's nothing compleatly special just something worth getting and watching it twice. The gore in this movie is not bad, it's a gory enough movie but this one is more about story line then violence."
3,April Fool's...,I think this was a noble effort to make a horror film based on the old April 1st trick. A group of frends gather for a weekend on the lake at a wealthy friend's house. People start dying off for a myriad of reasons and the group is isolated without a way to reach help. There are a few clues and plot twists that keep you guessing until the very end. I thought this was a fun campy horror film. Enjoy.
3,Somewhat atypical 1980's horror movie.,"Muffy St. John (Deborah Foreman) is a well-off college kid who invites her friends to spend the weekend at her parents' island home. Amidst the barrage of gags, the guests soon start turning up dead and it is left to two of them to try to escape with their wits intact.Playful twist on the standard slasher movie (produced by Frank Mancuso, Jr., who was involved with several of the ""Friday the 13th"" sequels) with a disarming sense of humor. Many viewers may know what they're in for judging by the title alone, and be able to appreciate it knowing that it's not taking itself seriously.That said, though, there are scenes of genuine suspense, light-hearted performances (the whole pictures's all in fun), and a noticeable de-emphasis on graphic gore.Not a truly great picture but enjoyable just the same.Just another bare-bones DVD from Paramount, however, with not even a theatrical trailer.3/5"
3,HAPPY APRIL FOOL'S DAY!!!,"I bought this movie last year on April Fool's day, because I had never seen it before, but I knew how it would end, because of it's title. Some friends are celebrating Spring Break by staying at Muffy St. John's mansion for the weekend. Throughout the movie, the friends die in grotesque ways, but it's all in good fun because it's APRIL FOOL'S DAY!!!"
3,Worth the wait.,"This movie always intirgued me as a kid. The cover of the girl with her hair braided into a noose? Good stuff! I finally got around to watching it as an adult, and it was well worth the wait! ""April Fool's Day"" is a fun movie! If you don't like horror movies, don't worry, the gore is pretty much non-existent. The characters are typical 80's type college kids. The conclusion was fun and refreshing.Very campy, spoofy type of movie, so if you're in that kind of mood, give it a try."
4,"""80""s Horror""","I great stroy line with decent acting and a wild twist at the end. Another great film from the 80""s!"
3,OK if you're looking for a bad horror movie,this was ok. my friend and i are on a big bad horror movie kick and way got this. It was pretty bad. But it was better than we expected. Oh and the girl who played Muffy's pretty cool. She was in Wax Works. That was a good movie.
5,GREAT HORROR FLICK!!!!!!!,April Fool's Day is a great horror flick from the decade that bought us wild hair thats right the 80's!!!!!!! The movie is about a bunch of kids go to this island to visit their friend Muffy!!!!! Needless to say one by one someone is killing the kids off!!!!!! The movie is fun and has a fun cast to go with including Amy Steele!!!!!!!!
3,Half decent 80's slasher fare with a twist,"April Fool's Day is one of the countless low budget holiday themed slashers that were made in the 80's in the wake of the massive success of Halloween and especially Friday the 13th. The minimal storyline involves a group of people and some April Fool's pranks gone awry that result in bodies piling up. What seperates April Fool's Day from the horde of lame 80's slashers is the dynamite twist, which you probably will see coming anyway. That aside, there is little to no gore here, which was a welcome feature considering the time that this film was made. The acting isn't anything to write home about, but then again is acting in a slasher movie ever something to take into consideration. Amy Steel, who starred in the second Friday the 13th film, is on board here as one of the unlucky party guests."
1,Horrible !!!!!!!!!!!,I brought this movie a couple of days ago and I was very very very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this movie.
4,"A fun ""Alternative"" slasher movie that brings big laughs and a few chills","While not great, this 80's ""Alternative"" slasher movie/mystery( look to the title and watch the movie to understand this) is one funny ride. The usual 28 year old ""collage"" students gather on an island of one of the ""rich girls"" for the weekend and get killed one by one. The last 10 mins. are just great. Like I said a ""cut"" above most slasher movies."
1,Foolish Film,"APRIL FOOL'S DAYIf you think ""Porky's"" wasan all-time film classicand you're looking forsomething a little moreintellectual, then you'lllike this movie.Fair warning:It's not scary.The characters are all idiots.It is mediocre in every waythat it is not terrible.The only interesting aspectof the film, the personalmethods used to scare ordisturb the guests,was undeveloped and becamemeaningless in the end.One of those that stands outis the recorded sound of acrying baby in the roomof a young woman who hadkilled her child by abortion,referring to the apparentlyunmentionable in cinema,that abortion may not bea lovely thing.There are so many good moviesthat there can be no reasonto watch this one.Benefit from my bad experience."
3,The Goonies meets Newhart meets Friday the 13th...,"The story wasn't very interesting, the characters were not very likeable, the gore was not very exciting or well done. There were a couple good scares and the girl was fairly creepy, otherwise, I would have given this film two stars only. If you grew up watching this movie, I can see why you might like it, but short of that, I found this movie pretty pointless."
1,Total Dud,"This is one of the most disappointing teen slasher movies I've seen lately. Firstly, nothing much happens for 30 minutes, and you get bored waiting for the action to start. The characters are completely obnoxious, and represent the worst of the 80s, so this is 30 long minutes. When people finally start going missing its anything but entertaining. The horror scenes look like high school kids did them. The ending is a big April fools joke, that really caps off this lame effort. Maybe the movie is trying to be clever, or make fun of this silly genre, but it isn't entertaining at all. Although the film is well produced it has little to recommend it. Not sure why anyone bothered to make this movie, but I recommend giving it a miss."
1,Awfully Lame,"This is the only review you need to read. Don't watch this movie. It wasn't scary at all. Stupid story with stupid actors & so much dead air with hardly any actual horror. I bought this used without seeing it & was very disappointing. You'd be way better off checking out any of the Sleepaway Camp movies if you like 80's slash, but this movie in no way compares to Sleepaway Camp; IT IS SOOOO LAME"
4,Great look and function,"I've had this set for almost two years. I love it. It is stylish and unique. I am actually planning to buy a second set to add to my collection. I don't find that the silverware is difficult to hold or grip. I do have a small complaint: in my new dishwasher, the silverware holes are bigger and the salad forks slip through the holes. Not a huge issue, but worth noting."
2,"a video game, not a movie","And that's good news, of course, if you like video games.But if you want a movie--even an action/adventure movie--this one isn't worth watching even once.Between all the relentless barages of one-second meaningless images, however, they do manage to sandwich in some of the ethical issues concerning cloning, and surprisingly they present some of the pros and well as some of the cons. For this, I give the movie two stars."
3,Total Recall Part 2???,"It seems they took total recall, repackaged it and sent it out as this movie. The plot is fairly predictable, but overall the film is entertaining. The problem is that Arnold is now 50 and is starting to show signs of age. After making the classic action movie Terminator 2, movie-goers are now demanding action movies with a good plot that is not predictable. I am not sure why Arnold doesn't try to make some more complex action movies, actually just ones that we cannot figure out what is gonna happen after the first 15-20 mins. I would say this movie would make a nice rental, but not worth buying it."
4,a combination of arnold action talent+ a brilliant story,"I really liked this movie a lot the action is Arnold sryle & the story is brilliant , after all these years arnold still the action hero , & the twist in the story is great i cant say more JUST DONT MISS IT"
3,To BOB,Too bad BOB spoiled the ending for everyone who wanted to read his review BEFORE they made up their mind to rent it.
2,UGHHH!,What I thought was going to be an intelligent Arnold film turned out to be too long and dull. The story didn't develop until it was too late. Thank God Predator and Commando are on DVD
2,A Snoozer,"Well, all you reviewers sold me on this Arnold flick. Better than Total Recall? I don't think so. Maybe I wasn't in the mood, but this movie struck me as old hat. The helicopters and some of the other hardware was neat, but the ""plot"" was tired.Arnold is yet another average schmoe, working at an average job (OK, he's a chopper charter pilot) .......... Enter the bad guys, Arnold's family is threatened, and the schmoe is transformed into a super-hero. We've all seen it so many times, it's hard to buy anymore.The only wrinkle is the cloning, so we get TWO aging super heroes instead of just one. I was literally nodding off on the couch during the finale. Unless you are a hard core Arnold junkie, I'd recommend you pass on this one."
3,"""I might be back.""","This movie was a breath of fresh air after the disgusting effort titled 'End of Days'. This is more like the Arnold we are used to with the smart alex one-liners, lots of gunfire, and the 'man against the establishment' theme we have grown accustomed to. Sure, the story reeked of 'Total Recall' and the gunfire was done better in 'Eraser', but nobody does these films better than Arnold. I also thought Duvall was WAY underused. On the sunny side, the helicopter/jet effects were indeed cool and it was packed with other cool effects and many funny lines throughout. I thought it could have been MUCH better with a more credited action director. Overall, well worth seeing on the big screen and consider it his warm-up for the inevitable sequels to Total Recall, True Lies, and of course T-3. Arnold's got several good films left in him, let's just hope he can get the directors he needs - McTeirnan or Cameron - to make them five star movies."
5,I might be back,"The Sixth Day DVDThe Sixth Day is A Science Fiction movie about a man who is unknowingly cloned. Arnold Swarzenner is the protagonist, he must prove that he's the real one while, at the same time, battling against the organization that cloned him, they are out to shut him up. Plenty of action and thrills.Recommended for both the Science Fiction fan and the Arnold Swarzennegger fan.Gunner December, 2007"
2,"Second verse, same as the first","...this movie starts with biblical scripture and blends it with a current event or issue. In this movie, creation is blended with the issues of cloning. This movie gets us to ask ourselves the question of whether it is right or wrong and what other questions must be answered...Unfortunately, this movie seems to be borrowing the basic layout of the previous films and adapting it to the new story-line. As a result, this movie gives you a feeling of deja vu. ..."
2,All the extras ripped out. Basically a standalone movie now,"Columbia has just announced a rather surprising downgrade and street date change for the upcoming The 6th Day DVD. Poor Arnie, he just can't get a break lately, can he? Columbia will be dropping ""The Future is Coming"" HBO First Look special, plus the 10 featurettes, the 3 storyboard-to-film comparisons and the 2 animatics. The remaining features still on the disc include the isolated music track with composer Trevor Rabin with commentary; the ""Re-Pet"" infomercial, talent files, production notes, trailers and TV spots. Columbia is lowering the price of the disc to $24.95, and will be removing the ""Special Edition"" banner from all advertising and the packaging. The street date has also been bumped to 3/27."
3,Average Arnie Action...,"Not a bad little action movie. Typical Arnie action genre, and entertaining enough to keep you watching. It is good to see him doing what he does best. As usual, no expense was spared, and the special effects were the best part of the movie. The moive really desrves 3-1/2 stars, but the system doesn't allow for that, so 3 stars it is."
3,Just another Anry flick.,"Interesting concept and fairly good idea, but Schwarzenegger is starting to show his age and you can tell he knows it to buy some of the scenes in the film, the DVD really lacked extras basicly it had none worth watching. With that amount of FX you'd think they would put a ""Making of ..."" on it. Over a clever film, but I wish I would have seen it before I bought it, I'd have ... right now or more likely a better movie. Schwarzenegger has done better and so has the film industries. It's watchable, but save your money and catch it on a movie channel real soon. 3 STARS and I'm being nice."
2,Could've been better,"Schwarzengegger's return to action didn't fare much better in this clunker about a regular joe named Adam Gibson who co-runs a helicopter business. Gibson learns that he's been cloned and the ""replacement"" that is living out his life, means he must be exterminated by a prophetic businessman and his group of dastardly cohorts. This film, while not bad, just seems flat and uninspired. Schwarzenegger's return to action doesn't do much and it seems that the standard action sequences take place with at least one mandatory car chase. The only real amusing scenes involve the continual cloning of the businessman's henchmen, and a scene involving two Arnolds at once, but rather than that, it just seems out of place."
3,"... with an expected ""Twist""","Supposedly there is a twist to this film about who really isthe clone and a couple days after watching it, I could care less. Ireally like Arnold movies... but I was a bit disappointed with thisone. Even Robert Duvall couldn't make it impressive. It is yourtypical, bang bang shoot 'em up Arnold flick. To me it seems likethey wanted to make something that really throws you off, keeps youguessing all the while you say to yourself, maybe this could reallyhappen. ... thats it. But you really doget captivated by any of the characters. If you wanna see Arnold dothe same old thing shooting people and blowing ... up.... this isjust for you...."
4,Not Schwarzenegger's best but still a great movie!!,"The 6th Day tells the story of a helicopter pilot and family man Adam Gibson(Schwarzenegger) who gets cloned and his clone takes over his life. A very good film with a good plot. I don't care for some of the critics reviews saying it was too far fetched. Get ready for some plot twists. I really enjoyed the design of the near future, which reminded me of Total Recall. A fun film, not his best. Schwarzenegger's bangs out another great action film! Can't wait for his next! Rated PG-13 for violence, profanity, some sexual innuendo, and brief nudity."
3,"Mostly for XFL fans...One Liners help, like Commando, but not quite enough","Another of 'Arnuld's' thick, lispyheavily Austrian accented Sci-Fiflicks that takes a stab at morePro-Evolution gibberish. Note thatthis movie was made in 2000, it alreadywas gabbering about the upcoming (flop)XFL. A good cast is sort of wasted inthis coputer generated film. Humourhelps but like Commando, not enough.Still I can't believe this Masonicclown became 'The Gov.' of California.But then, it is the land of fruits andnut(z)ies..."
4,"Saw it, loved it, actually lived it (kinda).","Hi guysFirstly, The movie was great!Secondly, The scenes of ""school"" for the childrens recital and arnie running down the hall were filmed at my old high school. Anyway, long story short...Alot of equiptment was stolen after the film crew left..Great movie, great plot, GREAT SFX. Oh, and my dad actually met arnie!Peace"
1,Arnold fans it's all yours,"If you're a fan of Arnold, you'll like this. I mean he's the same in his roles...and the action is the same...and the writing is the same.GIVE ME A BREAK!"
3,Wasnt as good as his others,"""Ah-nuld"" is back and brawnier than ever! This time, Schwarzenegger is a helicopter pilot who finds himself on the ""To Do"" list of a murderous tycoon (Tony Goldwyn). The good news is that the hit gets botched. The bad news is that Goldwyn has cloned Arnold, who must fight to get his life back. An action-packed spin on the ethical quandary of cloning, The 6th Day is future-perfect."
2,That Arnold Schwarzenegger...WHAT AN ACTOR!!!,"Arnold Schwarzenegger in perhaps his greatest dramatic role...I haven't seen a performance this rich, this nuanced, since the slobbering bulldog in that ""Turner & Hooch"" movie. Best of all was the scene between Schwarzenegger and Duvall...a meeting of acting titans that was long overdue...imagine what these two could have achieved opposite each other in the Godfather films if only Scharzenegger had played Michael Corleone instead of Al Pacino...""I know it vas you Fredo--und now, I vill crush your szpinal column und then rezite my clever zinger, ""You szhould have had more backbone!""Anyway, back to this movie--a little long for a movie version of a comic book, but kind of funny for obvious reasons. I would actually give it two and a half stars, but the grading system here won't allow fractions. By the way, male viewers take note: The girl assassin is really cute."
3,Average action flick.,"This movie is one that isn't bad at all, but not one that is that great either. The acting is fine as it has Arnold, plus it has Robert Duvall and Tony Goldwyn which are both great actors. The one thing I didn't like about this movie however was the ""sketchy"" storyline. It was interesting enough, but didn't have anything amazing. It's not Arnold's best movie by far, but it has just enough punch for some fun to be had."
4,Half the Salary But Twice The Star?,"....I liked this film!!! I have always loved a good concept and this one tickled me in a way I probably haven't been since Back To The Future II.This film definitely came close.For my mind it was an intelligent, taught, exciting effects ride but above all else it captured my imagination.And that's not something that happens so much anymore. :-("
2,More depth than you think ...,"Uninspired action sequences, but raises some surprisingly interesting questions and dilemmas about cloning."
1,Miscast lead in an otherwise enjoyable movie.,"This otherwise enjoyable futuristic action romp is cursed by the casting of a gratingly over-the-hill Arnold. And since it was released and Arnold has gone on to be an unsuccessful, ineffective, nastily prejudiced right-wing politician, it has become increasingly hard to watch his old movies and see him as anything but an unsympathetic person. The movie might have squeaked two stars from me back in the year it was released: now, it's like trying to watch Richard Nixon playing the terminator..."
1,Got Soap?,"This is movie that has been well described already so I won't bother. But I wanted to warn you that the actors need to wash their mouths out! I am a 30 year old woman who does not appreciate hearing people swear in movies, and my husband and I wish we hadn't bought 6th Day because of the language. I don't appreciate the ""F"" and ""S"" words like they must think I do. The movie would have been just as good (BETTER) without the profanity. There is also some rather graphic violence scenes for a pg-13 movie. I think there should be some kind of warning on the box for movies explaining the rating. If you buy this don't say I didn't warn you...."
4,COLOR THIS GUIDE A WINNER,"A must-have directory offering comprehensive state-by-state,city-by-city, information about traveling and permanent collections and exhibitions, ticket and reservation details and general info on museums nationwide. Color this a winner."
5,On Exhibit the Art Lovers Travel Guide toi American Museums,Excellent references for art lovers!Looking forward to a new edition.
2,thoughts but not revelations,"the book is much like the published review here. dragu actually has little to say throughout the book, what she says usually doesn't have too much impact. the part with the cops is a rather scary portrait of the law and the best part of the book, in my opionion. the rest of the book doesn't really answer all the questions one might have about strippers and their work. it takes a view of society as a whole and makes wild statements about society's sexuality/repression of sexuality and how this all relates to stripping. none of the theories are original and not much new is said about them. it also took an overly sympathetic view of the stripper, to the point of condescending the poor little women in the middle of the moral storm. i did read the book quickly as it's short, but i can't say i agreed with the tone or the way it's information was presented. i had no revelations reading this book, it was a lot like someone's college thesis."
2,Bowling shoes- runs small,I always wear a 9 1/2... I had to send back for a 10 and by sending back cost me 12.95 and had to enclosed a check for 9.95.. so besides my purchase cost me an extra twenty for the shoes. Its all Elite shoes. Nothing to do with Amazon..Hope they are comfty.
1,Bowling shoes made for a clown?,"The picture doesn't accurately show how shiny these shoes are. I wanted a fun looking bowling shoe, but these really do look ridiculous! They do look like plastic shiny vinyl clown shoes. I felt that they had a really wide fit too, but ran short in the toe. They were really stiff when I tried to walk in them too. Buyer beware, if these shoes need to be returned you must pay shipping AND a 15% restocking fee(which was not made clear at the time of purchase) If you need to buy bowling shoes online, I recommend Dicks Sporting Goods since they offer free shipping, free returns, and no restocking fee... I wish I had."
5,More great Nucleus and Ian Carr - great,"As a student, I went to one of the concerts on this tour (Liverpool) and was captivated by the complex rhythms that this band produced. I'm forever grateful to fellow student Malc Cunliffe for suggesting this concert. Ian Carr is one of the great team players - in spite of being the ""lead"" in his band(s) he never dominates but lets the other musicians have their say, building complex patterns that cover a range of emotions. If Jazz can have ""ballads"", Ian Carr generated them. Truly one the greats of the world Jazz scene. His passing in 2010 is a great loss. Another side to this legendary musician is his collaboration with Don Rendell, best exemplified, in my opinion, byShades of Blue/Dusk Fire"
1,All 4 burnt out in less than a week,"I purchased the 4-Pack and all 4 were burnt out in less than a week... I've had previous success with these GE bulbs, but this batch has a VERY short lifespan."
5,What a great replacement!,"I was skeptical that these would have a significant improvement over the usual soft white bulbs, but wow, the difference is amazing! The light is much cleaner, and less glare inducing, the 'whiteness' is incredible. It's very pleasing, I was impressed.As a result, I've replaced every single bulb in my house, and am heading back to the store tomorrow to get more reveal bulbs!"
5,Nothing is like reveal bulbs,"I started using reveal bulbs forever ago. I couldn't stand the yellow-ish light from regular incandescents. These give a very clear light. I've switched to mostly CFLs, but in some spots, like when the bulb is going to be upside down or when it's in a small lamp casing, the heat can make the expensive CFLs expire far too quickly. For those places, I have the reveal bulbs. I was leery about ordering lightbulbs from amazon, what with the shipping and all, but it was fine. I figured that amazon's customer service would help if anything went awry, so I went for it. I ordered them late one evening and got them the next afternoon with prime shipping (!?) with every single one intact and fine. So if you don't feel like going to the store just to buy lightbulbs (like me), go ahead and order them here!"
2,"Good light, bad lifetime","2 out of 4 bulbs blew their filaments barely two months after installing. The quality of light is pretty good, I do see a difference between these and normal incandenscent bulbs, but what's the point if they can't last long. Going back to full-spectrum fluorescent until GE fixes this issue."
3,"Generally great, though some blew out in weeks","I've always liked the light that the Reveal's put out. However, the durability is quite mixed. Of the 8 we got, 2 blew out in a very short time (just 2 weeks), while others were fine. Regardless, I will miss the ease of use and affordability of these bulbs when CFL's come to the forefront in 2012. Better stock up now!"
3,Watch for repeated and reprinted mistypes!,I had a copy of this book once and it took me less than one minute to hit on one mistake that reprinted on two subsequent pages (25-26).It shows:byte a = (byte) 0x0e; // 15 in hexWhat?! The 0x0e is 14 in hex! I guess that the author meant to say:byte a = (byte) 0x0f; // 15 in hexProbably to finish that book for ABAP ASAP they copy-pasted a lot of text.So -- Watch for mistypes!... because I am quite sure there are more surprises)))
3,American Poet,"In the sort-of easy, surrealist, mannerism of Heliczer's work, we are simultaneously charmed and made aware of a dark undercurrent of thought that keeps us questioning his intention. His line breaks and diction do seem arbitrary at times, but his metaphors provide many interesting hooks that coalesce in the imagination long after the book has been set aside for other interests.Ultimately, what we come away with is the idea that Heliczer has left us with a testament to his double vision, as he synthesizes late twentieth-century New York in the mindset of a medieval troubadour. Amid the sometimes sterile environment of contemporary poetry, this book provides a fruitful cathedral of new avenues for a whole new audience, giving Heliczer a rightful position among the visionary artists of the twentieth century."
5,Good Gift,"Bought this for my wife as a gift, she loved it! Really quick shipment and good packaging! Shipment arrived quickly and as described. It is a bit challenging, and has sit in a drawer since we haven't been able to put it back together, but thats a user error. Do not cheat and pull it apart!"
2,"good idea, poor execution.","I ordered this for my son, who is young (7) but loves these kinds of things. Knowing he would need the assembly instructions I was happy to know they were included. He actually got it apart on his own!! But the problem now is there is a misprint on the assembly guide. Steps 9 and 10 are missing and 13 is printed twice. I hoped to find an online guide but I can't find one. I hope someone uploads one soon. Until then, I'm disappointed."
1,Not challenging at all...,"Purchased this for my brother for Christmas. I figured that after reading the reviews and the description that it would provide at least a few hours of challenging puzzle time. Unfortunately, my brother had it apart in ten minutes.I'm sure others may find it more difficult (or perhaps even less!), but in my case it was not what I had hoped for."
4,Extremely challenging,"My husband, who is usually very good with these kinds of puzzles, has not been able to solve this one. It does come with a clue book but he refuses to use it. It is definitely difficult, if not impossible. It is nice quality and colorful."
5,Great Gift,"I got these for my 1 year old nieces, they loved them. They played with them for days without putting them down!"
5,Exactly the same as the prime-line brand,"This is a medium quality, standard, frame-less glass shower door roller. It is exactly the same as the version sold under the prime-line brand (available at home depot, ace, etc). It is shiny chrome with rounded roller wheels and some horizontal decorative lines in the metal. Just like the picture it has 3 screws and a single wheel on each bracket (2 total).One nice surprise was that each bracket came with an optional rubber liner to help clamp the metal bracket to the glass. It worked well enough that I didn't even need to use caulk to make them stick. I would recommend to slowly tighten each screw in an alternating fashion just to be sure they are clamped really tight. This was the first time I had worked with these type of shower doors so it took me about an hour to complete altogether.I would highly recommend these if you like the styling and cannot find them in a local hardware store for less."
2,Superficial and dangerously incomplete,"This book has not had a sufficient editorial vision of the whole book, nor control of the content of the individual chapters. The timbre chapter is among the most incomplete and superficial in existence. This could be said of many entries here.There is absolutely no doubt these are people of authority, but the whole is far, far less than the sum of the parts.Most importantly, almost no chapter explains how the entire set of concepts connects specifically to *computerized* sound.Howard and Angus ""Acoustics and Psychoacoustics"" is a far more cogently structured, complete, yet introductory, approach to these topics."
1,key parts are missing!!,"This copy of Being and Nothingness is missing one of the most famous sections of the original by Sartre, without any explanation or warning. The section on ""bad faith,"" one of the most well known and necessary sections of the book, is simply omitted. If you need this book for a class, you are guaranteed to need this section of the book, and this edition will be of absolutely no help to you. All the other sections are the same (I believe) as other copies, but all of Chapter 2 of Part I is missing. Ridiculous."
2,So you say you are passionate about Philosophy?,"I don't see how people can rate this book so highly. Am I missing something? I think people are simply impressed with themselves for actually having read this book. It is the Iron Man of philosophical works.I read the first 100 pages then gave up. But in doing so I was expressing my good faith. I believe that the world would be better without dry, long-winded philosophical treatises. Why do we need 600 pages just to say that we need to follow the golden rule? This book is literary torture!"
3,splitting hairs in a vacuum,"This edition of ""Being and Nothingness"" is the full Hazel E. Barnes translation published by Washington Square Press. By any standard, it's one of the greatest achievements in Western literature and a seminal work of modern philosophy.So why did I only give it 3 Stars?It's worth reading if only to understand the human capacity for inventing a psychological landscape. It's a-maze-ing. Sartre's existentialism is exhausting. If you put this much thought into anything, nothing would get done.If you're a grad student, you have my sympathy. Otherwise, you'd have to have a Sisyphus mentality to tackle it. It's the product of an intellect as sharp as a X-Acto and as blind as a pitch dark basement. And I'm a fan of French literature.Read a Jerzy Kosinski novel instead. It's shorter and the print is bigger."
3,only for initiates,"Hey folks, this is not a book for beginners. And I mean beginners in a large sense, even those who have read Camus or Dostoyevsky ARE beginners. And when i give it only 3 stars I dont mean it's bad, I mean it's not philosophical enough, not systematic enough, not dense enough, that is not repelling enough for beginners. When you read Hegel's Phenomenology of the spirit, Husserl's Logical meditations, Heidegger's Being and Time, well then Sartre's Being and NOthingness is just a small piece of cake. If you're interested in Sartre though, truly, and how Sartre is haunting our post-modern era in its obsessive rejection of Sartre, then Being and Nothingness is indispensable. Glad to see there are beginners who dare set on the daunting task of reading it though if for one thing, you have understood Sartre's philosophy of projection, then dont get stuck with Being and NOthingness but try to go beyond it."
2,"interesting ideas, horrid writing","i just finished reading being and nothingness for one of my philosophy courses. the book has several excellent ideas and geniunly important insights to the human condition, but these ideas and insights are hidden behind such obstuse verbosity that the work is nearly impossible to read. ""consciousness is a being such that in its being, its being is in question in so far as this being implies another being than itself."" catch that? may i suggest jean-paul something such as: ""one cannot be conscious without being conscious of something."" so, if you enjoy literary and philosophical torture, read this. if not, go read some camus, he's far superior anyway."
2,Sartre's angst to write the epitome of existentialism (living life outside of it!),"This book is for the most part tedious and often it will get on your nerves, but nonetheless your effort will be rewarded with some valuable knowledge. Sartre intentionally writes in an academic, obscure, constipated way that makes you wonder whether it is due to your limited mental capacity that you do not understand what he is saying, or that he takes so much pride in his superior self that he does not want to be understood by the many. The trick when you read Sartre is to recognize in his writing those parts that correlate with the experience of your own everyday life. Doing so, you will be able to find some practically useful wisdom in Sartre's thinking. After all, every philosophy of life should fundamentally relate with our everyday existence, otherwise it is not philosophy but some sterile theory destined to fall in limbo."
4,"Starts out well, but not enough laughs","""Being and Nothingness"" reminds me of a fine meal with a bad dessert. You end up saying, ""Can't I come away with more than fruit?"" In a metaphoric sense, I wish there were more dark chocolate sprinkled in, more cream, more butter. But this is a common criticism of Sartre and I don't mean to belabor the point."
2,"Dogmatic, esoteric, and confused best describes it!","Just like the artwork and poetry of the 21th century,this book is confused, vague, and vulger. Sartre defines his many self-styled words with themselves. He makes philosophical claims without backing them up in much the same way that theological books have asserted religious dogma in the past. Sartre's work is, and will continue to be enigmatic, not because it is deep or complex, but because it is obtuse."
5,"Buy the ugly white cover, not the orange one.","Not because the white one is better. They are the same translation. The orange one is ABRIDGED, which is mentioned nowhere on this website, as if the two books are the same.They don't even have the same publisher.Trust me: unless you can find the 1956 edition from the Philosophical Library, buy the white version from Washington Square Press. The Citadel Press edition is abridged and more expensive. Even if it has a nicer looking cover, don't buy it."
1,A bad edition of a great book,"Being and Nothingness is a difficult but great book. This edition is terrible. It omits some of the central passages of this classic. For instance, the beautiful section on the 'Patterns of Bad Faith' are deleted. If you carefully read the inside of the jacket, it does say it is an abridged edition. That would not be bad if they deleted unimportant sections. Instead the publisher deleted key sections which they reprinted in their edition of Essays in Existentialism. So you are forced to buy two of their books.If you want a copy of Being and Nothingness, get the Washington Square Press edition or the Routledge edition."
5,Review from a layman,"If you are just getting your feet wet in ontology then this book will be very challenging and often frustrating. As you slowly become accustomed to the terminology and basic ontological concepts, the book becomes more and more readable and enjoyable. If you ever felt you were all alone in your existential dilemmas, then this book will provide great comfort. Everything is here in this book if you are willing to take the time. Contrary to an earlier review, this book makes perfect sence and every concept is backed up with logical analysis. Sartre is very good about providing clear and concise examples to all of his concepts. This is not a philosphical treatise on ethics so it is hard to understand why an earlier review labeled it as dogmatic (that person must be referring to a different work by Sartre). A dogma based on nothingness is hardly any kind of dogma."
2,"It's the translation of Hazel E. Barnes, but has a lot of typos","It is good to have a Kindle version of a good philosophical work, but it is rendered useless when you find a lot of typos. Some of them: in the original says ""interiority"", this version, ""inferiority""; not one time, but several. Even if the work is based on the translation of Hazel E. Barnes, this errors can lead to misunderstanding of the key statements of the book."
4,Difficult but rewarding,"Once you learn the semantic games that Sartre is playing with ""you are what you are not"" and so on, you get a sense of the urgency of existential philosophy. If you are seriously searching for a philosophy of life, existentialism is a great place to start, and this book is the cornerstone of existentialist thought. However, there is a God shaped hole in Sartre's philosophy that is never filled - being merely existential is not enough!"
5,"Wow, this is a really fine book - what a treat","As point of comparison, the movie rates a 2+ compared to the book. This work is a joy to read, very enriching. I now have an appreciation of a world that I never noticed. No reservations."
5,"This isn't just a read, it's a ride",This is simply a great book. Laura Hillenbrand is a great writer. And Seabiscuit is a great American horse. We are lucky to live in a world where such a wonderful story can be told and re-told.
3,Like a history book,"I struggled to get into this book, and finally decided I could not continue. I'm sure it's great if you enjoy reading straight from history books, but I do not. It was written in third person (at least to the point I stopped, which wasn't that far in), which I don't enjoy. Others raved about this book...I guess I prefer something different."
4,Surprised to like the book,"I was surprised that I liked this book. I don't particularly care for horses, and picked it up only because I'd just read Dick Francis. While the book is undoubtedly primarily about horses and horse racing (and thus loses some steam about 2/3rds of the way through unless you REALLY care about horses and horse racing), it's also about the advent and success of the automobile and about the individual characters who were involved with this particular horse and its competitors. *That* I found interesting."
4,Seabiscuit,"What a fascinating book - I didn't read everything about each race (I am not a horse racing fan) but the details of the lives of the jockey, trainer, owner were amazing.Great read!"
2,"DECEPTIVE AD, PACKAGE SAYS, "" $14.95 in Big Letters","Artwork on cover is VERY different from the ad on Amazon, and makes you look like a cheapskate (see title of this ad), so it's a bad choice as a gift!As to the narrator (Campbell Scott) , the story, and the wonderful Lauren Hillenbrand, they make it impossible for this deceptive advertising to ruin everything."
4,"a great read, but","Seabiscuit: An American Legend is as exciting as the best kind of mystery novel, and readers will not be able to put down its accounts of how this undersized horse became one of the greatest performers in American sports history. The book has all the drama and romance of ""Chariots of Fire."" Its only drawback in fact is that the story it tells takes place in a vacuum. If there is a Depression or a looming world war, characters here never seem to sense it. The few times that Hillenbrand does sketch out a larger historical context (e.g., when Santa Anita becomes a detention center for Japanese-Americans in the early 1940s) make readers recognize what they're missing the rest of the time. So this is an great read, but part of its story is missing: the relationship between the horses, their owners, trainers, and riders-and the larger American culture."
5,A five star story,"Seabiscuit and I were born just a year apart. I used to watch him race at Santa Anita, less than 5 miles from my home. Laurie Hillenbrand has done a fantastic job. I have never read a more engrossing book, so much so that I read it in one weekend, finishing it with an all night stint on Sunday night-Monday morning. I commend the book to all sports fans."
5,Great!,Grateful to get the large print book as I have been looking for it for some time. My husband had read Unbroken and wished to read Seabiscuit as well and he does need the large print version. It is like new!
2,Seabiscuit,Seabisquit:I found the writing boring. I am not a fan of non-fiction. I tried reading it for a book club
3,ya gotta love the sport,"I liked the book, well written however since horse racing is pleasing but not captivating I became impatient with racing records & found the personal information about owners, trainers, jockeys, companion animals and characters found in horse racing of great interest. Found myself jumping past pages of numbers in favor of other information.Still haven't finished it because I don't need to know all about facts & figures. An aficionado might enjoy it more."
2,Too much background info at the beginning!!!!!,"Long, boring, and just plain slow. Those are the words that come to mind when i think of this book. The first 100 pages are background of the owner, trainer, and jockey. I found myself slogging through them barely able to stay awake. However, once it finally got to the racing part of the book it got more interesting. But unless you avidly follow horse racing you'll find yourself lost and re-reading passages over and over again. I would have put this book down if I didn't have to read it for a school reading project."
4,Excellent Characterization,"Seabiscuit is filled with interesting details and descriptions about life amongst racehorses such as how the jockey's make their weight before their races. The introduction of each character is rich with description, so intertaining! This fast read keeps you eager to turn each page. Seabiscuit appeals not only horsemen but also to cityslickers like me."
5,Terrific writing!,"The author did a marvelous job of keeping the story fresh and suspenseful and that is not always easy to do with history. Her writing is crisp and her delightful descriptions of people and the times are peppered with a gentle humor. Underlying the whole story of the trainer, the jockey, and the owner is her appreciation of the nobility, competitiveness, and heart of this small, ungainly horse. Thank you for the experience!"
5,Best Racing book of all time,This book dispells the myths surrounding Seabiscuit and adds greatly to the legend. It is a required read for the race fan and horse lover as well as the non-fan. Laura Hillenbrand doesn't just give you the facts...she takes you back in time and you feel as if you are there. I couldn't put it down!!!!
4,Great History piece of the US from Great Depression to WWII,"The book shows how life was in the US from the start of the Great Depression to before World War II. It took a topic I was not interested at all (horse racing) and described it in a way that made it really interesting. I enjoyed learning about the life of a jockeys and racing horses. The writer made the horse races more exciting than if one watch them live. The writer would describe the races in detail where explaining the difficulties and strategy of the jockey at every moment. Threaded through the book was the story of Seabiscuit, which could not have been better than if it was fiction."
5,Great read,Laura is a great writer. She does her home work and tells a great story with the facts available. I read Unbroken and enjoyed that too.
4,Very good but not as good as Unbroken,"I am enjoying this book- Laura Hillenbrand can write nonfiction that flows like a novel. I bought this after reading Unbroken, which I loved- this book isn't as good in my opinion but still worth reading."
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,"A great new book about a really famous horse from the late 30s, ""Seabiscuit."" One of the fastest ever, but doesn't show up in the records much because he didn't get trained right and discovered until he was four, so he never had a chance for the Triple Crown races which are limited to three year olds. But he smoked the famous Triple Crown winner War Admiral when War Admiral was at his peak, and set all sorts of speed records that stood for years. They ran him successfully until he was 7, which is sort of an unheard age to still race. In 1938 he got more press than either FDR or Hitler (they were #s two and three, respectively). Great story about the rich owner (he brought cars to SF in 1906) and the crazy jockey. Sort of like ""Rocky"" only wholesome and true. And lots better. It's got up to No. 2 on the NY Times Nonfiction Bestseller List. Universal Pictures is making the movie. A breath of fresh air."
5,"Riveting, uplifiting","Yes, the movie was pretty good, but the cliche applies--""the book is better"", much better. It is simply a sublime piece of writing, all the more admirable if you know that Hillenbrand wrote most of it on a board hovering above her while flat on her back with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Nothing will do but another cliche, rarely to be invoked, but applicable here: ""you can't put it down""."
5,Exceptionally Well-Written,"You don't have to love horses or racing to appreciate this book about a little runt who could. Exceptionally well-written and fast paced, Laura Hillenbrand has created an absolute masterpiece...I sped through all 400 pages in a day and a half, and can't wait to reread it! Brilliantly crafted."
5,Seabiscuit: not the movie,I loved both this writen version of Seabiscuit which told you more of the horse and deplored the awful life of jockeys in the day. I also love the crafted story in the movie that Ms. Hillenbrand covered in the book but shortened and visual in the movie with a good soundtrack is stunning.
4,Great Reading,Thought is was well written and gave a great picture of the times. Can't believe how popular horse racing was back in those days.
5,Terrific!,"I resisted reading ""Seabiscuit"" until just recently. I thought, ""Who wants to read a book about a horse?""Then I read ""Unbroken"" and was blown away. I then concluded I would read anything about anything by this author and be rewarded -- she is so talented. She could write a book on the accumulation of dust and I would read it.Ranking the two books -- I would give ""Unbroken"" a 10 out of 10 score and ""Seabiscuit"" 9.9999999 out of 10. My father-in-law was in a B-24 over Europe during WWII when it was shot down and he became a German POW. So all of the info about B-24s and POWs gave ""Unbroken"" a tiny edge for me."
4,"Read this after reading ""Unbroken""--Hillenbrand is a great writer",I read this book after reading Unbroken. Seabiscuit is a good book and good story that I would probably would have given 5 stars too if I hadn't have read Unbroken first.I will read anything Ms. Hillenbrand writes from now on. Her books are unbelievably well researched and written.
5,"If you have not read this book, buy it today!!","Seabiscuit is a great story, book, and movie. If you have not read it, buy it today and start reading. You will not be disappointed."
5,Excellent book,"Terrific book. Not only is it well-written, but it presents horse racing in a heartfelt way that many people can relate to, even if they do not follow or bet on horse races."
5,Wow!,This is just a great book. I didn't know if it would hold my interest as I am not interested in horse racing at all but it sure did. It is so much more than that. I strongly urge everyone to read it. Truly remarkably written. I fell absolutely in love with Seabiscuit.
5,Sea Biscuit-a winner!,"This book was based on actual events and is well written. It held my attention (which can be difficult) for the entire book. I started on the plane to the Bahamas. At one point, I actually sat on the balcony (instead of doing activities) to read."
2,Not sold on Seabiscuit-mania,"I must admit I couldn't get past page 100 of the book, but if it doesn't hold your interest by then... Maybe you have to be a ""horse person"" to get it. The book was extremely well researched and well-written with painstaking attention detail. I certainly know more about the secret lives of jockeys than I ever imagined (which was quite interesting). Overall, I had to push myself to get as far as I did in the book-for a book club meeting-and don't plan to finish. None of us could see what all the fuss is about."
5,Incredible!,"Fantastic! A completely engrossing account of three audacious and charismatic men who overcome Great Depression hardship and, by virtue of their talent and determination, are vaulted into superstardom. Oh, yes, and the horse: Hillenbrand's vivid and nuanced description brings the star of the show to life as a thoroughly unforgettable individual. Yet it would be a mistake to think that this book is just for horse lovers. The first half draws us into the early struggles of the protagonists, with fascinating snapshots of the old west's surrender to the new west, the rise of the automobile, the harrowing life of the jockey. The second half details the Herculean career of the horse and his team. I've never watched a horse race in my life, but I couldn't put the book down. Hillenbrand is a master of suspense; there are some real thrillers here. And the last chapters are heart-pounding."
5,a great story and storyteller,"This woman can write!....and what a great american story....the depth of detail, and the passion of her writing only make me hope she writes another book about another horse...thank you Laura."
5,"An inspiring story of perseverance, hardship, and victory.","The author did a great job and gave us an excellent story that reveals the amazing and demanding circumstances under which the subjects of the story live in the world of horse racing. Though Seabiscuit is the star and an amazing animal, I found this book to be more interesting and inspiring in terms of what we humans can tolerate and achieve. This book is also a great example of how life follows anything but a straight line."
4,Page turner for lovers of horses and horseracing,"It's a well written history of Seabiscuit but after a while it lost my interest. For someone with more passion about horses and race horses in particular, this would be quite a page turner."
5,True Story that changed a nation,Seabiscuit is the ultimate American story. He captures the what America is all about. To keep trying and to beeat the odds. The legend was made possible when 4 unlikely people joined up to create an unbeatable team. Seabiscuit was the 1500 dollar claimer that ran like a duck and showed no promise because of the lazy/stubborn streak in him. Tom Smith was the washed up trainer that saw passed the little horses exterior and saw the heart and courage he posessed. Red Pollard is the jockey who was blind in one eye and just about washed up when Tom Smith found him and signed him on. Charles Howard was the owner who made his fortune in cars but whose heart was in horses.Together this team beat all odds and rose above to win the most prestigious races in the country. Seabiscuit became and american icon. This book is one that is impossible to put down and really makes has you rooting for the little horse with the big heart.
4,Seabiskit book,"Just as described. It took awhile to arrive in the mail needed it for a report & ended up going to library, but the book itself worththe price."
5,"Excellent book, earlier book great, too","There is little I can add to all the well-deserved praise for Laura Hillenbrand's book. Her writing is excellent, the story is incredible, and it is one of those books that you are sorry to see end. I was surprised to find that there was an earlier version of this story called, ""Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion,"" by B. K. Beckwith. It is hard to find, but well worth it. It is much shorter than Hillenbrand's book, but it appears to have been an important source for her own bestseller, as the notes attest. Beckwith's book sticks just to the Seabiscuit story and has a lot of color from the era. (It was published in 1940 right after Seabiscuit's spectacular Santa Anita victory.) It provides the ""proof"" for Hillenbrand's book and is non-stop excitement."
5,Fascinating!,"Even if you don't follow racing very much, you will love this book. It is very informative and I recommend it to everyone!"
2,Maybe it's just me,I have never watched the movie version. Heard great things about the movie. Decided to get the book. I almost bored myself to death after a few chapters. Maybe it's just not my type.
5,Re; Seabiscuit,This was an amazingly well written book about an interesting group of subjects. I would recomend it to anyone with an interest in historical events and horses
5,Great Book,"I got this book for my husband since he had not read it. I had borrowered a copy to read. After he saw the movie, he started looking for our book. I told him we did not have it that I had borrowered one to read. He said we must have this book in our library. He loves the book. Great book and would use this seller again."
5,Story comes to life!,"It doesn't matter if you have never even seen a racehorse or a race before - Laura Hillenbrand writes such an amazing story, you cannot help but be drawn in. She truly transports you through the book on the edge of your seat, introducing you to people, places, and horses you can't help but fall in love with. You will forget you're reading a biography - and come out the other side a true horseman! I read Seabiscuit after falling in love with Unbroken - and neither book dissapoints!"
3,Seabiscuit,"The story of Seabiscuit is absolutely remarkable. Out of a nation in crisis rises an incredible symbol of hope and out of the depths of poverty rises a man with a passion. Red Pollard and Seabiscuit are an American legend. Though Laura Hillenbrand attacks this novel with great enthusiasm, she seems to lack a much-needed sense of emotion. She becomes too overwhelmed with the facts, failing to draw the reader into the characters' successes, failures, and disappointments. The novel becomes more of an encyclopedia than a living story. Nevertheless, the characters are well-developed, the challenges that jockeyes face are well described, and Seabiscuit's journey to fame is adaquately portrayed. Luara Hillenbrand brings a weak, but informative life to this American legend-- you can't help but be inspired!"
3,"Hype, Hype and More Hype","Unless you are fascinated with the the underbelly of racetracks, specically the exploitation of horse and human flesh, there is not much else to recommend this book other than a spectacular job of research by the author."
2,An embarrassment to the book,"The book was a five - but this edition, as it turned out, is a hardbound paperback. The inside margins are very narrow, and the stiffness of the hard binding make it a chore to read the book, thus the book is embarrassed by the binding. What a shame."
2,"Bad movie, Worse book","Saw the movie years ago, and thought it so boring. Read the book a few days ago, and was even worse!Why did this book do so well? There was just no staying-power.I am sure that Seabiscuit was an icon in his days, but this book just did not highlight his glory to justice.Definitely a book more dear to those who know more about horses than I do."
5,It almost made me wish I was around to see him,I just finished reading Seabiscuit An American Legend--it blew me away!!! I wish I had been lucky enough to see this brave little horse run--Ms Hillenbrand has written an absolutely fascinating book bringing Seabiscuit and his Team back to life. I found it hard to put the book down and felt my heart pounding as I read about the match race between War Admiral and The Biscuit. It is all to rare to see a biography that reads like a good novel but Ms Hillenbrand has accomplished just that. Buy and read Seabiscuit--its a sure bet.
2,why do people think this book is so great?,"when by bookclub choose this book, I thought ok I'll read it. Now since I have atempted it, I wonder why this book was choosen for so may awards? This book is trying to cut a steak with a dull,plastic knife."
1,Where's the horse??,"The cover tells it all. You only see the horse's rump. If the book is called Seabuscuit, put the horse's FACE on the cover. And no race stats either!?"
1,Couldn't finish it,A nonfiction history of horseracing. Reads like a textbook. If you like that sort of thing...
5,Great work,"What a great work of non-fiction! I first thought this was just some over-hyped movie: over-hyped director, over-hyped crew, and that the storyline would be bad. How wrong was I! This book captivated me from start to finish. I am amazed to learn what life as a jockey as like. What they do to their bodies, all for very little recognition, is unbelievable (and not quite healthy, mind you). I like how the authors weaves historical details throughout this book, and the fact that this book takes place during the depression is of key importance. It is also a very uplifting story: what can happen when you really set out to accomplish something. Another great work of non-fiction that I enjoyed - at least if you're a guy - is Make Every Girl Want You by steve reil."
5,Bravo,"Well written. Great storytelling with colorful characters. Even if you don't have an interest in horseracing, or even horses as such, the human drama pulls you into the story and keeps you turning the pages."
5,A book you don't want to stop reading,"I love this book. A true story of a horse that always seemed to beat the odds. It is not just about the horse but the people in the horse's life. It has a lot of human emotions that I think everyone can relate to. There is love,sorrow, victory, defeat, and so many more. After reading this book you feel like that you were there with all characters."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"Read this book, even if you have minimal interest in horses or horse racing. I am not knowledgable about either, and yet I found this MASTERPIECE to be a true page-turner! It is so well-written and so thrilling that it keeps you up late into the night to discover more of the story of Seabiscuit, his visionary owner, his preturnaturally sensitive trainer, and his exquisitely attuned jockey! A book that really evokes another time and another way of life."
5,Best Book Ever!,I agree with the others-did not want this book to end!Very well written and so interesting! Loved the characters and loved learning about Seabiscuit! I sure became a fan of this little horse!
5,The best non-fiction book I've ever read,"You don't have to be a horse or horseracing fan to enjoy this. Anyone who likes to see the underdog (horse and jockey in this case) win, will love this book. Sometimes truth is better than fiction, and this is the perfect example. It's SO MUCH better than the movie which omitted key characters and messed up facts."
5,Larry's Picks,Outstanding quality of book and one of the most wonderful stories I have ever read. Hilldebrand is so gifted it is hard to measure her against any other author.
3,Did I read the same book?,"I was surprised at the high ratings given. Maybe you have to be a 'horse person' to appreciate it, but I found the book to be (and I'm quoting Homer Simpson here) BORING, wire to wire. The writer clearly researched her story, but she also went into way too much detail about anything and everything. It bogged down the story like a muddy track on race day. Also, I got the feeling she had purchased a super-dooper thesaurus software program for her computer and was trying to get her money's worth. Lastly, I didn't always see the heros of the story as all that heroic. Howard fell in love with his son's wife's 26-year-old sister (coincidentally about the same time his 30-year old marriage fell apart) and Pollard was an alcoholic for most of his life. I don't mean to harshly judge people who were once living breathing souls who walked the Earth, but there was way too much hyperbole in 'Seabiscuit' to believe that they were as noble as the author would like you to think."
3,Crowdpleaser,"Perhaps if I had read Seabiscuit before the hype, I would have thought more of it. Here is my take on it.Pluses: gripping action writing, characters well developed.Minuses: history is simplified, prose often over-heated.Liked the movie better!"
5,GREAT BOOK,This was a great book. The beginning section was alittle boring but other wise A WONDERFUL BOOK to read before the movie!
4,Seabiscuit: An American Legend,"Seabiscuit, by Luara Hillenbrand, is an absorbing tale of a horse racing legend. The vivid descriptions in the book makes the reader feel like you lived in the 1930's. The book ressurects the drama of horse racing. Hillenbrand has a way with words, in this novel, the reader feels like the jockey participating in the race. The book wasn't just centered around the horse. Those who owned and took care of Seabiscuit were just as interesting as the horse. Personally, I would give this novel two thumbs way up."
5,A fascinating look into the horse and the people involved,The author captivates the reader right from the first page. This is a wonderful book providing a look into American history. You need not be a horse racing fan to enjoy this book. I rate this in my all-time Top Ten books I have ever read!
2,A hard-bound paperback...,"I've not yet read this book, so my rating only reflect on the physical quality of the edition I purchased. The ""library binding"" edition does indeed have a rigid, durable binding, but in all other respects is identical to a paperback edition. The dimensions of the page are small, and the book is printed on very inexpensive paper that is likely to yellow very quickly. The binding also is so close to the printed margin that is difficult to read the beginning of each line. Save yourself some money and buy the paperback edition."
2,a history of horse racing,"if your interested in a detailed history of jockeys & Southern California horse racing get this book; otherwise watch the movie instead, its much more fun"
2,Not a Horse person? Don't buy it.,It was a selection for our book club and I have tried three times to read it. I can't get past all the details and therefore I can't want to read it. I am not a horseperson. I wouldn't have bought it if I wasn't required to do so.
3,Rather boring...,"I can't believe the reviews on this book! I read it months ago, and found it long-winded and boring. I am not a horse person, and truthfully, after reading this book, I find myself not wanting to ever go to the horse track... I am shocked sometimes by what novels capture the ""common folks"" attention. Literature this ain't!!! Beach reading this ain't!!! I need to read a book to help me fall asleep; now that's the rub."
2,"If you don't love racing or horses, don't buy this book!","My bookclub chose this book and I have to say this is the first book I haven't finished in a long time. By page 40 I was thoroughly disappointed and angry that I had wasted my time. But I have to admit - I'm not at all into the races, and although I like all animals I have no particular affinity to horses. I wanted to like it, I went into it with an open mind, but while there were some interesting passages, I wasn't spellbound by this story."
5,This book makes most others pale in comparison,"Wow what a book. I just finished it. I may have to rethink the evaluations and ratings I have given all other books I have read. This is an amazing read. Even more so becuase it is true.I don't remember the last time I felt such a range of emotions while reading a book. Truly the people and especialy ""The 'Biscuit' are inspirations to us all. A truly wonderful, inpirational book. One of the best writeen books I have read. I highly recommend this book."
4,An enjoyable story well told,"Seabiscuit fills the place in American Mythology that can only be attained a true ""Rags to Riches"" story.Laura Hillenbrand has recovered a true American story that warms us to the dream of what this country wants to be."
4,check out the special collector's edition,Seabiscuit: An American Legend (Special Illustrated Collector's Edition)
5,Merits the Hype,"When this book was first published, I heard all the great reviews, but not being a horseracing fan, I thought, "" How interesting could a book about a horse be?"" Well, it meets and exceeds all the hype you've heard about it!If the movie is even HALF as good as this book, RUN, do not walk, to see it! I literally inhaled this book over 2 days, and was completely taken in and enthralled by the story of this improbable champion and the men who believed in him, and brought out the best in him. The meticulous research and documentation by the author is seamlessly converted into a ""you are there"" story...this will be a book you cannot put down!"
3,My daughter hated this book! LOL,My high school daughter had to read this book for a class. She said it was so boring. Take that as a teenager's impression. I did not read it.
4,Mr. Krivaks Independant Reading Assignment,"I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who enjoys riding horses or the rags to riches cliché scenario. A few parts of this book seemed a little dry, but those parts (or scenes or chapters, whatever you wish to call them) are almost inevitably followed up by a strong scene of action and determination."
5,First Rate and A Must Buy,"I loved this book, I love horses, and I love gambling. I was there in every page. Ms. Hillenbrand is truly a gifted writer. I laughed and cried. One of the best summer reads ever! I highly recommend this lovely book."
5,Great book. Impressive research,This is a must read. It is well researched and a compelling story. Laura tells a good story it is hard to put the book down.
4,Based on a true story western!,"While Wyatt Earp's Revenge is not one of the best westerns in our collection it provides good acting and an interesting story (based on a true story). Without giving away the ending, the story line centers around a much older Wyatt Earp who chooses to reveal an untold story about the past to a journalist in the hopes of setting the record straight. I will see this movie again. To the Wyatt Earp fans, this movie while not a five star rating, IMO rates better than a two star."
1,ONE BAD WESTERN!,"This movie is bad. I never expected it to be historically accurate- so spending time on this point is a waste of time. To get to the point: 1.Badly written 2.Badly acted 3.Badly directed - the sets were bad, the costuming was bad- this movie looks like it was filmed on a weekend (maybe just Sunday). The good: 1.The cover (I bought it with great expectations) 2.It has an ending.As far as the ending goes, I'm not sure if Val Kilmer died at the end or just fell asleep- it did look lke he was in pain- as I and my son were also. I can't imagine a western being any worse- I'm sure there is one- I just haven't seen it. This movie was so bad I actually threw it away- the idea of giving it to anyone went against my better judgement."
3,Not that bad.,This is not a great movie. But it is a fun movie to watch. Maybe not perfectly accurate to the true story it is based on. But then what movie is? The acting was good and the plot very entertaining.
3,Insult to the movie tombstone,This killed it for me.. Tombstone was sooooooo good and then Val Kilmer does this....saddened....lol Nobody can replace his doc holiday...
3,good western,"Here we have a new dvd on western legend Wyatt Earp; the movie suffer some slow action time but Val Kilmer deserve always a look; what we need is more western on big screen, on tv (with Hell on wheels) and also on dvd only!!"
2,Not so great,"I tried hard to like this movie but the story was disjointed, the acting poor, and the action sequences were cheap. It could have been good but Hollywood took too many liberties with the story. For example there was a recurring anti-gun theme. One victims family would not allow guns in the house or teach the child how to use a gun. In 1878 Kansas? Really? There were still bands of Indians roaming the countryside killing settlers in the area at that time. Everyone including famers, ranch hands, and kids, where armed."
3,Hmmm...,"For all that this movie was...it wasn't ""Tombstone""! With that said Val Kilmer did an excellent job at portraying an aged Wyatt Earp, but then again, Val Kilmer is an Excellent actor.I am a Wyatt Earp fan and I found this movie all in all to be lacking in many areas, 1st--Costuming was not good, modern hats were used, and even some hollywood gun rigs. Some actors should have been playing other roles, Unfortynately I paid for the DVD and should have rented it."
2,Only if nothing else is on.....,"John Ford said ""Do you want good history or a good movie?"" Well we get neither one here. The true story is so badly handled that it is barley recognizable. The boy playing Wyatt Earp always walks around with his hand on his gun, ready to draw it from a cross draw holster that I don't think Wyatt ever used.(Yes I mean ""boy"" since no one except Trace Adkins looks over 19) They continually get down from their horses on the right side, not the left, which in reality means the horses are well trained. Maybe the human actors should take lessons from them. The Bill Tilghman back story is wrong, and the whole thing looks like a High School production."
2,Wyatt Earp's Revenage,"I will never buy a digital download movie from Amazon again. You can only watch it on the computer you downloaded it to. Or on another computer after you log in with Amazon and bring the movie up on your video library. You can't burn it to a DVD blank because of Digital Rights Management (DRM) So therefore whats my the rest of my family suppose to do? Huddle around a computer monitor to watch the movie? Bottom line is I should have bought the DVD for a few bucks more. That way I can take the movie anywhere and watch it on any DVD stand alone player. In regard to ""Wyatt Earp's Revenge"" It sucks. My first thought it was a made for TV movie G rated. Reminded me of Bonanza or Gunsmoke."
1,Wyatt Earp's Revenge,"Just an incredibly stupid story line, punctuated by bad acting except for Val Kilmer and lack of good directing. Scenes that make no sense. Dialogue straight out of a grade C movie. The March of the Killer Tomatoes is probably as good as this piece of garbage. Very disappointed in the movie. Was hoping it would be a lot better."
3,"Good Bag, but expensive","Love the stroller straps, but feel it was too expensive. Held up very well, but does not fit more than one childs worth of stuff."
4,decent debut,"some weak cuts on this album, but the versions of too much of nothing, tobacco road, and society's child are superb, as is the original track sunshine help me. not as good as spooky two or the last puff but worthwhile and interesting. a decent debut that should be given say 3.5 stars. certainly quite different from the pre spooky tooth band art. art was spooky tooth's original lineup minus gary wright. some of their best material is on this debut and i think the ideal compilation of spooky tooth would include the tracks mentioned above, the title track is an o.k. song as well. if you like heavy rock from the 60's reminiscent of traffic and led zeppelin, mixed with blues and soul, and a bit of psychedelia,doing intriguing and unique versions of others material with some fine originals and excellent vocals and solid playing, this band may be for you."
3,"Defect in track 7, Tobacco Road","Yesterday I returned a recently purchased, new, sealed copy of this CD due to a defect at the end of Tobacco Road. Specifically, at the 4:56 and 5:14 marks, the opening 4 seconds of track 8, It Hurts You So, plays. I suspect this is common to all pressings of the Repertoire version. Anybody else out there notice it?If my copy turns out to be a fluke I'll certainly obtain another one. Otherwise, I'll be getting the Edsel version minus the 8 bonus tracks."
5,Take Responsibility for Team Success,"For years, I have resisted the popular notion of ""there is no `I' in ""teamwork"" because teams are a collection of individuals working toward a common goal. Each of us brings our own values and skill sets to the table. It is our choice to work together (or not) as a team.Christopher M. Avery has captured this idea and more in his latest book, Teamwork is an Individual Skill: Getting Work Done When Sharing Responsibility. Chris suggests that individuals take responsibility for team success versus blame others He challenges the reader to be proactive and work through team issues rather than avoid or accommodate others.This is a perfect book for team members who have been on teams before. It will validate good team behaviors and point out areas to upgrade...in a gentle and non-threatening way. The book is easy to read with lots of stories and examples to highlight the key points."
5,"Read this, Old Shoe",The adaptations of PG Wodehouse's Wooster and Jeeves stories staring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are all excellent. I saw them all on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS a few years ago and have been hooked ever since.The humor is very subtle... Hugh Laurie's portrayal of Bertie Wooster really makes it all work.
1,Terrible Buy,"I have gotten 2 of these stereo systems by 2 different companies; Sony and Panasonic. I've returned them both. The same manufacturer MUST produce these, they are nearly identical. They claim they play both writable and rewritable CD's; but they don't play either; they skip and snag through the whole thing. The changing mechanism is loud and clumsy (I'd be afraid that would break quickly). I have not tried the Philips, but like I said, they are identical to the one Sony uses and Panasonic. They look nice, great for a kitchen or bedroom and that's their draw; but if you're looking for a reliable, long-lasting system that will play your mixed CD's; they are worthless."
2,Several significant annoyances,"I bought this system for use as an alarm clock as well as a mini audio system in my bedroom. Based on several issues, I've decided to return it. 1. The panel is way too bright. At its brightest setting you could easily read a book. At its dimmest, it still casts significant light. 2. The clock itself is too small to read unless you're very close to it. 3. The speaker cables are very short - 6 feet?, and they don't detach from the speakers, so they can't be replaced. 4. The CD mechanism is very loud, slow and clunky. 5. The buttons on the remote are small, mostly identical, and poorly labeled. 6. Sound is OK, but not impressive. If you have no intention of using the alarm functionality and don't might the brightness, it may be an OK choice, but I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great Product,"I can pretty much echo all of the positive things people have said about this system. The sound is wonderful and the look is stylish. Initially, I was looking for an alarm clock that would allow me to wake up to CDs, but wanted more sound than the typical alarm clock offered. In the time I've used it, I have grown to love the ""wake up"" timer feature--it is a little hard to learn how to use at first, but after awhile it sinks right in. There is even a snooze button. There is also a great sleep feature.I agree with the reviewer who complained about the dim backlight. The lowest setting is a bit brighter and I wish the backlight turned off as well. In addition, the CD Changer mechanism is definately ""clunky"", but let's not forget this is a lower end system. Phillips decided instead to focus on the sound and style, and having experienced those things, I don't mind the clunky changer. And those are the only two gripes I have."
1,CD changer problem.,"Purchased as a gift for my parents. The sound was far superior than all other systems tested, even those costing much more. The remote and controls were difficult to understand initially. The unit worked well and was greatly appreciated for 2-3 years. Without warning the disc changer refused to play any disc and continually cycled through the three trays, neither playing any of the two discs loaded nor allowing you to remove them. It now sits unplugged with two CDs stuck inside of it. Electronic components should last much longer than what this did. Will not buy another Philips system."
2,3 cd changer fails,"The 3 CD changer started jamming after a couple of years of very low intensity use (2-3 times a week). I had to open it up to rescue my CDs and it then worked for a while, but started jamming again. It then seemed to work if I only used one CD at a time, but eventually it jammed again. There seems to be no obvious way to disconnect the changer itself, and forget about replacing/repairing it. The electronics and motor are still fine - it is the mechanical components associated with the changer that are a problem: They are all made of plastic, and will eventually wear down (the teeth or gears or belts). My decision for next time - no changers."
2,CD changer died...,"Like others wrote, CD changer was fine for about 2 years, then started acting randomly, until it refused to open or close at all. I pried it open to get my CDs out, breaking the CD mechanism for good. Too bad, because I loved the overall design and sound of the system."
5,Love it,"I just bought the Philips MC-50 and I love it! Excellent sound quality and nice design. I bought it after returning the SONY MHC-MG110 model back to the store (the one that comes with 60 CDs, 150 watts...whatever ! it didn't cut it for me) because of the poor sound quality. I am very satisfied with my Philips MC-50, and by the way it comes with regular ""treble"" and ""bass"" buttons and no stupid preset equalizer settings.Philips MC-50===>Great Quality, Great Design, Great Price"
5,very nice,"I bought this system for my mother. It comes with a fat little manual but she figured out everything on her own in a few minutes. It's compact and won't overwhelm your room. It's easy to use and most important of all, it has a great sound. The radio is better than all of the other compact systems I've tested adn the 3 CD changer works perfectly. It's a great little system for a bedroom or den. My mom is delighted with it and I was satisfied that I got the best system for my money."
1,CD changer problem,"After a lot of research (including reading information on this site), I bought this system. After setting it up, the CD changer drawer refused to open. It seemed like it was jammed. I never did get it to open and am returning the product.I had noticed in a store that the mechanism was a revolving setup that seemed complicated and perhaps prone to breakage. A random defect or a design flaw? Now I am not sure whether to exchange this for another one or get something different.Other minuses include the tiny button size and the fact that the CDs takes a long time to start or for the CD drawer to start - I noticed this in the store. All I want is a simple durable design with excellent sound - and it sounded great in the store."
5,Warm & Tender,I bought this for my bed-ridden mother-in-law. She loves soft background music. This was perfect. Everything arrived on time. Very good service.
4,Errata,En la Ec. 6-122 pg. 264 el subindice del tercer termino de la derecha de la ecuacion: phi* dice 2 debe decir 1.Por favor si tienen un Fe de Erratas comunicarlo a todos los usuarios.El libro es excelente. gracias
3,A bit too class-room orientated,"It's a good choice for teachers teaching the language, not only does it cover the French language, there's an unique part where you learn about the culture as well. However, there are a great number of French textbooks I've come across that are a much better alternative to this one mainly because they have less unnecessary diagrams and they cover grammatical rules in greater detail.I also thing the workbooks excercises that comes with this book are a bit grueling. The interactive approach in this textbook is a plus but I just don't think they covered enough the important language rules. If you need better grasp of the language, get yourself Schaum's Outline in French Grammar, it has saved my grades in my first French classes and never failed to give me an A afterwards."
3,Rambling diatribe that picks up toward the end,"Robert Hughes takes aim at Americans' preoccupation with victimhood, the battleground of multiculturalism, and the mediocrity of modern art in this collection of three essays expanded from speeches that he had given. I basically agree with him, but the first two sections of this book read like the ramblings of a grouchy old man, albeit a very well-educated one. It comes alive in the final section, in which Hughes laments that Americans have come to see art as something therapeutic, that the intention to heal or offer solace has come to be of more value than the technical merits of the piece. This section also includes a very interesting and entertaining account of the furor over the work of Robert Mappelthorpe."
1,A weak book,"It's mostly a self-serving rant about all kinds of things Hughes doesn't like, and it has hardly a thoughtful or well-researched idea behind it. I don't think this kind of book does anyone any good--it simply encourages people to be intellectually lazy and to whine about what personally affronts their private sensibilities. A narcissitic book from a very vain, very pompous man."
1,Creature of Complaint,"Funny, when I think of the term ""culture of complaint"", this book is the first thing that comes to mind as being a document belonging to that culture.This book is motivated less by thought than by curmudgeonliness. Hughes is a poor thinker and an abominable art critic. He consistently mistakes artistic innovation as ""poor quality"", often evaluating art which occupies an interstice between established forms by rigid and inappropriate terms.(His particular condemnation of certain artists reveals his unfamiliarity with their actual work; he perpetuates misrepresentations of the artists that were, in fact, conceived by the right wing.) Hughes does not think in social terms; rather, his naive analyses are informed only by his unexamined taste-- a taste continuous with that held by many other individuals who happen to be heterosexual, white, male, aged, and grumpy. A coincidence, Hughes would suppose."
4,REAL IMPROVEMENT FOR DTP,The last DTP cd was ight but this one cranks more. I give Luda big ups on this project it's like they actually put some work in this one unlike Golden Grain which seems like it was thrown togather. All in all this joint thumps it made to into rotaion in my cd collection but the next DTP joint might even better can't wait.
2,no good,yo this album was overrated and for no reasoni'm not gone say that's it's plain garbage but if they had a betta team lyrical wise and a better production team then they would be alright.the best tracks on the whole thing is shawnna's gettin' some and the track call that's my S***
1,"If u gave this man more than 1 star, u must be his daughter!!!","Hey Ludacris AKA Josh Childress,you want a Gerogia?...well...i got your GEROGIA over here!!!"
2,"Not that bad, but not that great either","Ludacris & Disturbing tha peace do have a good going for it, good rapping and some decent lyrics, but otherwise this is an ultimately predicable and so-so album, thought it does have a few good moments and some good songs, ludacris and his crew try hard, but it's ulimate discontinue by a complete messed by lyrical content and banal beats.I Hope they can do better next time.Thumbs Down."
3,Luda & DTP,I originally bought the CD only for one song and the rest of the songs were ok. This was my first time buying one from DTP and I was a little disappointed. It was ok.
3,Average,"Georgia is the highlight from this album, of course, but did anyone else like Gettin Some? I felt like Shawna brought it strong for the females out there. Otherwise, this CD could have been a coaster. The two extra stars they got were specifically for those two songs. Oh, and the skits. Those were....cute?.....another white noise album."
2,What happned Luda?,"I liked his first couple of albums, they were funny, creative, and displayed luda's real talent. While this CD has luda on it, it has more of the other performers, and none of them are even near luda in terms of talent. Luda is pretty funny on this album, but it seems that his last couple of cds have been getting worse and worse. If you really like ludacris, then get ""Word of Mouf"" or ""Back for the First Time"". If you absolutely love those albums, then get this one and his other two. If you just find them decent, then stop right there."
2,"Well, I had to trash this when God found me.","Well, I only purchased this simply because of the song ""Georgia"". I no longer listen to it because I have realized since I have been asking God for direction that he has given in to me. It is music like this that keeps us from having a peace of mind. We picture what we hear and of course with rap it is more graphic because our life usually relates to the music we listen to. I have no reviews for this but do hope that you find God and his purpose for your life if you do decide to listen to an artist who cannot take you to your destiny or hear you in time of need. Save your money or use it to contribute to your wellbeing. God Bless YOu."
1,No Fit.,"While this case looks rather cool, it doesn't fit properly on the 60GB. You can get one side locked securely, but you will not be able to (under any circumstances) secure the other side, cuz it's too small."
1,Humming Sound,Do not purchase this item. The speakers hum really bad and it doesn't have easy to use preset buttons. The humming sound is what makes it really annoying to use.
5,So sexy!,I am soo in love with this top! It really enhances the look of your cleavage and it looks just like the picture! No complaints at all!
4,Good product,"I took 20 minutes to assemble, then I stained the 2x4 and the assembled bench looks good - I would recommend this product to others."
1,Really poor customer service,"First of all the instructions on the box are incorrect as far as the bill of materials. Second the ""lifetime guarantee"" is just those words printed on the box. There was no real warranty included with the product spelling out what the guarantee is.Worst is the customer service. They try every means available to try and keep from speaking with you by giving you # options which is just another message on their phone system. After thirteen (13) phone calls I finally got a person on the line who put me on hold and I stayed on hold for seventeen (17) minutes and finally gave up.The next day I tried again and finally was given an option of leaving a message and would get a call back. That was 7 hours ago and no call back.If you get one of their items, you better hope that nothing EVER goes wrong with it. How good is a guarantee when you cannot get in contact with the manufacturer?"
2,Lasted less than a year.,"The bench was great when first assembled. But after 10 months outside in Arizona, the plastic frame had been devoured by animals to the point that one leg was completely gone and the arms were just tatters. I would not recommend this for anything but very urban areas with little wildlife."
1,misleading,"misleading - no where did it say that you had to buy 2x4's and spend more money to make this bench or chair. It cost over $50 just to buy 2 sides and a bag of screws, that is a disgrace, and you people should be ashamed of yourselves."
3,Beware the Instructions!,"Buyer/builder beware!I am so glad that I carefully studied (and did not trust) the alleged instructions, which were, by the way, no more than a few pictures on the box.For my four-foot bench, I was ""instructed"" to cut three four-foot 2 x 4s, and two 41"" 2 x 4s. In actuality, the bench requires nine four-foot 2x4s, and no other lengths. Had I followed the instructions, I would have wasted eight feet of expensive treated lumber, AND needed a second trip to the lumberyard to buy additional boards.My four hours' labor has resulted in a great bench, no thanks to the manufacturer."
5,A New Concept for An Outdoor Bench,"We like this bench so much we bought another. It comes in a relatively lightweight box, and we easily assembled it using our own wood. We chose the location for the bench, then put it together at that location so we didn't have to move it once it was one piece and heavy. We've had it now for over a year and it's sturdy and charming. You'll enjoy this bench, and the price!"
3,Missing parts,"The product was shipped and received in two days, but the package of screws supplied with the order was missing a couple of screws! I paid for a complete product, but that is not what I received!! How can we rectify this mistake by amazon or the company who originally shipped the product. Please advise Asap, Thank you. I ordered three 2x4 basics Anysize Chair. What good is amazon or blitz products. Especially if I have to Go out and try to find matching screwsusing my time and expense and gasoline. Please advise how we can fix this problem. I can not return the product because it is alread assembled, and the package has been discarded. I ordered 3 Chairs and every package had the same problem...."
5,great project,Third item purchased from 4X4 basics product line. Each was easy to assemble and definately will last forever. first one is 8 years old and still looks brand new.
5,"Very clever, very solid, will last for a long long time","And it is very affordable. It also looks very nice. I just completed our lower patio area and these look fantastic. I built 6', 4', and 3' benches along with a 4' table. I used pressure treated wood from Lowe's and Home Depot (neither would cut pressure treated wood as they claim it will mess up their saws!). After letting them weather for the summer, I will apply some stain to match our deck. Assembly is a breeze -- a power screwdriver is a must -- no need to pre-drill holes. With a little care, these should last for decades. We looked for days for a suitable suite of outdoor furniture, but nothing really clicked...most stuff out there are cheaply built and wouldn't last very long and require too much maintenance. With these pieces, you don't have to worry -- they will stay outside year 'round. Lastly, they are extremely comfortable!! Great, Great, Great product. **check out my uploaded pic**"
3,thats how I see it,"I have purchased several outdoor benches over the years and this one is just barely acceptable. I thought it would be overkill, all the screws, but it needs everyone and more. You will find it very helpfull to use clamps on the seat when drilling and attaching the boards so they can be lined up straight. For me this type bench is comfortable and this one is no exception. It is made in America!"
5,Excellent Product,"Strong, lite weight, and USA made. You just have to add some 2x4 lumber to complete an easy, strong, and durable project, in my case, a 4 foot bench."
5,Byron Lee...The BEST party CD of the summer!,"Oh my god! I went to the Bahamas just this Spring Break '99, and the song Doggie brought back sooooo many memories! Especially from the Booze Cruise! HAHAHAHA! Well, I suggest EVERYONE gets this CD! It's soooo Sweet! Especially if you're having a pool party or something, this is the best CD. I friend of mine is having a going away pool party for me at his house, and I'm definately bringing this CD! BUY THIS!"
5,Great buy!,"I bought this CD when I was homesick for some soca tunes, and I was not disappointed. It is a great addition to the music collection of those who like soca. Personal favorite is footsteps. My kids who are american love it too!"
3,This book elevates the role of parenting,"There is much important neuro-science information, useful for any expectant parent. However the non-science input is a little too touchy-feely for my taste."
4,Did not disappiont!!!,The author drew me into this book. I have been in the field ot traumatology since before it was called traumatology and I loved this book. It was written in such a way that the information was easily understood and I could translate it to work with the children at work immediately.
1,"not received book, ordered beginning of june, not good enough","cannot comment on book as not received book as yet, ordered beginning of june, not good enough - help - waited long enough!!!"
5,awesome!!!,"Blue Ray rocks on this Sharp LCD!!! and at a price like this, nobody compares with AMAZON!"
4,Sharp Aquos,"I feel the Sharp TV was a good purchase and well worth the money. The picture is excellent; the sound is OK. We have the TV in a very open living area with lots of windows. We were afraid there would be a glare problem but there wasn't. The TV was shipped via ""Yellow"". It arrived in good condition, however, we were given a 10:00am to 3:00pm window and it didn't arrive until 4:15pm. Since we had to be home for delivery the whole day was pretty much shot."
3,Interesting stories,"The stories were interesting, but the writing was challenging - IE, characters tossed into the narrative with little or no explanation, sometimes unclear what happened when and to who (whom?), and most annoying, the use of dialogue between individuals long departed, at times ludicrous and unnecessary to the tale. Better to have cited direct quotes and stuck to narration of events. Also, I wondered at the author's happening on so many manifestations of the ghostly goings on, as if they were staged for her by the ghosts. The book would have benefited by a skilled edit before publication. Still, the stories were interesting, chopping writing or not."
5,Magical Music,"Trumpeter/fluegelhornist Kenny Wheeler is joined on this session by saxophonist Lee Konitz, guitarist Bill Frisell, and bassist Bill Holland. As you might expect from such a lineup, the lines are long and flowing, the interplay is intricate, and the compositions are extended and probing. There are some wonderful little moments buried within this CD, as in the title cut, where about three minutes in, Frisell and Holland play together, Wheeler and Konitz then join in briefly, then Wheeler drops out, leaving Konitz to take the lead, but with accompaniment by Frisell and Holland. This kind of thing happens over and over again, one musician after the other stepping forward, stepping backward, interacting, supporting, blending, bending, creating musical magic, magical music. This is a startlingly wonderful recording, a contemporary classic, and I cannot recommend it too highly."
4,Works great in high end fog machine,I have a $300+ fog machine and this works great in it. I can't say about the cheaper ones but for the price this is a great deal. Compared to a party supply store very cheap.
4,Make sure you dilute it for closed in spaces.,Smells like burning trash at full strength in a closed room. Slight but tolerable smell when diluted 50% or more. The fog still works fine at that dilution.
3,"Great fog, but seemed too thick for my fog machine","The fog is long lasting, just as described, but may have been too thick (as a liquid) for my high-end fog machine. The machine produced copious fog for several minutes and then output dropped to a trickle. Next Halloween I'll do some tests by diluting this fog juice a bit with distilled water to see if that fixes it. Otherwise you may want to try 'regular' fog juice first to see if you really need the super long-lasting, thick fog that this stuff produces."
5,This book is Full of emotion and activitey .It's GREAT!!!!!!,"Victoria Moore and her sister Sara,have to spend the summer with their grandparents and two cousins.After about a week,victoria has made a bond between her cousins and has discluded Sara which soon leads to a blood curdling experience that changes Victoria and Sara.It's emotional and greatly interesting.Vicki Grove has done a good job on this book that has now become my favorite!"
2,Choose another book,Me and my boyfriend found this book to be slanted toward the Jewish person who is having trouble with the mixed relationship. I think this is a good book for a couple that will carry on a lot of Jewish customs and forgo the Christian ones.
1,Not for Catholics,This book attempts to make itself out to be an impartial non-biased reference tool. I found it to be heavily biased towards the Jewish faith. If you are looking for a book to help answer your questions regarding interfaith marriage this is probably not the book for you.
2,Not as Durable as Expected,"I have one of these units on my balcony and after a few years it has become brittle, discolored and inoperable. This is not a panel I would leave outdoors over long periods of time."
5,"Not Much To Lose, and I still lost weight and feel great!!!","Hi there, I'm a petite person.. about 5'2, and weigh about 122 lbs. I tried Jay Robb's Fat Burning Diet for 3 weeks.. not because I felt I needed to lose weight, but because I was interested in burning the fat off my post-pregnancy body. Personally, I am completely amazed at this diet (way of life actually), it was so easy to follow, I just made up my own meals every day, following the low-carb/high-carb guidlines, and alternated days, while having one free day. Not only did I lose about 9 lbs, my energy level has increased dramatically, and I feel much better overall. I would highly recommend this program to anyone who wants to shed the lbs/fat, and feel amazingly healthy and energetic."
1,COMPLICATION OF A RESTRICTED CALORIE DIET,"I was very disappointed in this book. A lot of text to describe a ultra-low calorie diet. And the carb/no-carb rotation - I think it's just something to keep people interested.I have read both this and his earlier edition of The Fat Burning Diet. Usually later editions are just to add some new content or make corrections, but he completely changed some of his recommendations between editions. One example is that in the earlier edition, he recommended individuals trying to build mass eat 5-6 meals a day, while in the later edition he recommends only 3 meals.Save your money. If you really want to read a book on health and fitness by someone who knows what they are doing, look up Stuart McRobert's latest book."
2,Fat Burning Diet,"Got it, skimmed through it, same old diet as every other book. Not impressed! I returned the book."
4,Unlimited energy,A very good book on balancing your carbohydrate intake to maximizing your energy while controlling your weight. Jay Robb explaines the process of alternating high and low carbohydrates to obtain a healther life style.
4,"A little of this, a little of that.","Another version of the Atkins Diet essentially, with the added twist of certain days devoted to carb loading instead. You still have to avoid the really high carb stuff, sugars, certain dairy, etc. There's also a lot about whey protein powder touted here and if you get a bad reaction from whey, as I do, you'll have to work around that part. Is it sustainable, long term, I doubt it. The Atkins diet has never proven to be for most people. But if you want to try something a little bit different, it might be worth a go. The author's ideas about why this diet promoted fat burning are quite well explained."
3,Not sure if this helps,I sometime feels my car is running sluggishly and i have to press the gas pedal all the way to increase the speed or get the acceleration. I read about this product some time back and thought to use it. I have been using from then but I am not sure if that is helping that much. Gas acceleration is still kind of same and there is no help in gas mileage. I generally add 1 ounce per gallon of gas. My car is realtively new - 2009 Honda Accord. Please comment if I am doing wrong. I am giving three start assuming is cleaning my engine and fuel injector..that also I am not sure :(
5,Lucas gas additive,Even though I have used this product for a short period in both vehicles the gas milage has improved as well as using one grade lower gas with no ill effects.
5,i didnt know virginia was in scandinavia,"wow, are you sure these guys are american. They sound a bit like at the gates, if they were hoped up on caffiene. Great melody (but not in gay way#) and pretty darn heavy. If you like dimension zero check this out."
5,Pure Metal Mastery,"This album, A Celebration of Guilt, has to be the best thing that has been given to the world in a long time. Yes, it is only two guys that created the whole thing, but, when you consider that bands that have 5 and 6 members do not have the tightness, or the musical greatness that is possessed within these tracks, you realize that less may be better. When I first heard this album, I was not even through the first track, and I had to run out to buy it for myself. Willowtip keeps delivering the quality releases."
3,"Good, but no match for Fey.","Both this CD and Fey's ""El Color de los Suenos"" feature catchy dance-pop, but Fey's production team's creative use of percussion, sound effects and backing vocals make it clear who went the extra mile to provide ""ear candy"" to us listeners. ""Tu y Yo"" is a keeper, and if you're about the same age and gender as the protagonists of ""Sonadoras,"" you could probably overlook ""Fiesta""'s banality."
4,I LOVE THIS ITEM,"THE Gerber 22-41514 Gator Saw III IS EXACTLLY WHAT I EXPECTED BUT WHEN YOU TAKE OUT AND PUT BACK THE BLADES THEY CUT THE SHEATH A LITTLE EACH TIME. THE BLADES NEED A BLADE COVER, LIKE WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU BUY BIG WOOD SAWS. THEY COME WITH SAW TEETH COVERS. STILL A GREAT ITEM TO HAVE FOR SURVIVAL/CAMPING"
1,ONLY HALF GOOD,"I ordered this exact one for my 1997 Grand Marquis. It seemed so easy, I connected the wire harness to the radio in my living room, all I had to do was go outside and connect the two harnesses[the radio to the car]...when I went to hook them up only the power harness actually connected. The green harness you see in the picture is for the speakers and it does not fit the cars original harness.A waste of time and a waste of money, the shipping cost is as much as the harness.It went from what I planned as easy to a hassle slitting wires after I wasted money on this."
5,Arnott's rules,"I am a huge fan of water crackers and surprised by how expensive they are to buy in the grocery store. I am also very pleased that I can buy the Arnott's brand on Amazon. I think that one water cracker brand is fairly similar to another, I don't think that they surpass Cars or even a generic store brand. However the price is great, they are fresh and they always arrive in good condition with no broken crackers."
1,Awfully yellowish,"I got this in the attempt to replace a nasty blueish fluorescent, but found that it is quite yellow and quite dim. At least for the bulb I got, I'm not sure where they got the ""reveal"" idea, given the amount of yellow. So though it's probably a perfectly good bulb (and is nice and small), only one star, because it doesn't do the one thing it claims it does, provide clean non-yellowish light."
4,"Creepy, corny, and all together messed up",I have to say it was very hard for me to watch this film the first time because Bruce Boxleitner is so not Captain Sheridan in this part. A man with a drinking problem and his sister move to this small town and she takes a job as a nanny for a widow with two girls. Her alcoholic brother decides he likes this family and wants to be part of it. From here the insanity begins and although he seems like the perfect new addition to the family his sorted past comes to light and we find that this new addition is not so perfect. Twisted and yet satisfying.
4,Good Product and Great Price,This works very good with off-road equipment to fix or prevent small leaks.Amazon has got a great deal for this product as compared with any local stores in my area.
5,Almost perfect,"This is a great product. I work on lawnmowers and we get nails in the tires constantly. This stuff seals em right up. The only thing I would complain about is that there's a small tool that comes with it to remove valve stems and it doesn't connect to the jug, so there's a good chance that you will lose it."
4,Outstanding Quality,"The technical excellence of Ritenour and the unbelieveable quality of the recording makes this CD a must have for any jazz lover. This has to be one of the best sounding CDs to ever be released. The only low point has to be the 'soft' remake of ""Waiting in Vain""."
5,great piece,The most beautiful recent jazz issue.Great sensuality and tender music takes you in a different (better) world.Must-have for jazz colectors.
5,interesting unknown history,"This book ofers you a look of a little know part of american history . It show what happen in the Ozarks when a few men took law into thier own hands and tried to make the town right by , by-passing the courts and prision system . This book was very violent but also well researched . It also shows a very unbiased account of the players and events that took place. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new part of history to look into . This will show you alot of what people in the Ozarks went through in that time period and it may shock you."
4,Eye opener in a few short pages,"While a very short book Dan does an excellent job of laying out a few basics that if you apply will sunstantially raise the level of your work. The first is the difference betweeen the ""entitlement"" attitude and the entrepreneur attitude. Secondly he adresses how we sometimes meet success but don't push ourselves to the next level, known as ""the largest cheque"". And thirdly how changing our mindset and work habits to where we are doing only productive income-producing work is the only way to take ourselves to the next level.Dan does mention his coaching program but it is only on the last two pages of the book. His ideas are basic but have the potential to have a major impact."
5,I'm glad he was able to tell his story,"I was able to meet Jack van der Geest in 2000. I will never forget the experience. He signed my book for me. He was quit older at the time,..... late 80's I want to say. Told us about the experiments the nazis's did to him. The hours and hours he stood at roll call in the snow, in the heat. (There's SO much more) He was a prisoner at Auschwitz. It is quit a read. I recomend it to anybody that likes to hear it first hand."
5,War like,I really liked this book from the first time I opened it up. It is a War World novel of all the things a man went through during the war. It was a good action and sad book.
5,"Powerful, important book","Jack van der Geest does a great job telling an incredibly tragic, yet exciting story. It is his memoir of his experience in Buchenwald and elsewhere during the World War II. As a teacher, this is an especially good book for middle and high school students. You won't be able to put it down!"
3,An Italian classic.,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Dillinger is Dead directed by Marco Ferreri, is a 1969 film about a man who discovers a revolver wrapped in a newspaper about John Dillinger's execution is led to believe that the gun was owned by him. Further things happen but revealing them may constitute a spoiler.The film can be hard to follow but it is well known and one much anticipated for a DVD release.Supplements are a theatrical trailer, interviews with actor Michel Piccoli and film scholar Adriano Aprà, and a discussion about the director led by various Italian filmmakers.This film may be hard to follow but its fame makes it worth watching."
2,Rethink this purchase-that's my best advice,I am writing this review as though it were me considering this purchase. I did the same before buying the mc70 and have had issues first with the buttons that control the cd mechanism (they didn't work) and then the CD's got stuck in the machine. I remember being warned in a prior review about this but thought that I would never do this. It happened and now it cost me $55 to fix this (I am still under warrantee but they will not cover this). I consider this a bad design as it is easy since there are three trays to mistakenly add a CD on top of another. Do it once and you pay. Their warrantee service also is not very accomadating. I am now on my own and not sure that I want to pay to fix it. I regret my purchase.Just remember my review if you buy this thing. Yes the sound is great but what's the use if you're always bringing it in for repairs?
3,volume?,"This system has good sound, but it is not loud enough. I have it set up in a small bedroom.I want to fear the 10 on the volume dial. The 10 should be uncharted territory. But when I have this system on, I often go to 10 and still crave a little extra.I wish I could get the same quality sound with a little more power."
1,Disappointed...,"When I received this system I was happy with the interface, sound quality and look of the MC70. Unfortunately, on the second evening of listening to my new stereo, two CD's were placed by accident on the same tray. Instead of rejecting the tray as most sound systems do, the MC70 swallowed both CD's and jammed. After finally finding a repair shop, I found out that not only were the CD's jammed in the machine but that the entire tray had broken and that a new part would have to be ordered (under warranty). I have now been waiting 2 months for this part to be shipped by Phillips and the part has still not arrived (supposedly the part is back-ordered - I suspect because this is a common problem...)As putting 2 CD's in the same tray is a error that occurs to everyone once in a while, I would strongly caution potential purchasers of the MC70 to think carefully about buying this system because of this serious design flaw."
3,Make room!!!,"This is a varied, challenging workout.My biggest gripe is that nowhere on the box is it advised that one must have a living room the size of a ballroom to fully execute all the moves!! A little frustrating!! One also need a weight bench & basic weights. Furthermore, Kathy's baby-soft, sex kitten whisper is even MORE annoying than those ultra-perky cheerleader-type exercise trainers (you know what I mean!!!)I exercise almost everyday. I used this video just one time."
1,showdown,claims to be another classic ... well it aint going to happen...actors.. they aint.. sound quality isnt there lacks a lot of luster ..the director must have been asleep during the making of the picture... if u want to call it that ... this is a film ... that should not have been made ..save ur money .. there is better films out there than this....
2,Poor Dice Man,"Big Dice Fan. I know he is trying to make a comeback but this is not the Dice of old. I was disappointed. Sorry Dice, still love ya, especially the old stuff."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I don't know if I didn't read the description right, but the basketball and hoop were a lot larger than I expected. The item was inflatable,also, and I was expecting a 'hard plastic' hoop.It was a decent price for what I got, and my older grandchildren will have fun with it when summer eventually comes, but the basketball and hoop were supposed to be for a small boy, and we were disappointed, as it was way too large for him to play with.I think the description could have been more accurate."
2,This stuff scares me!,"While much of this book might be considered thoughtful and well written, one thing bothers me A LOT. Carter says ""we would do well to reclaim the venerable idea that religious faith can be our best guide for political action.""I disagree. Politics is for ALL people and not ALL people believe in the mythology of religion. Why should those of us who believe that religion is merely a crutch for those who fear death, and is pure fiction made up in the minds of those who are too afraid to accept and feel the reality that they are merely the body and will die some day for good (no after life - sorry!), have to live under the rule of religious belief?Politics and religion should have no over lap at all. Would you want politics to take into account Star Trek for the sci fi Trekie world? The Bible is as much fiction as that. I know death is scary but do you want the TRUTH or just some story to make you feel better?"
1,Dreadful.,"Truly dreadful. A rave review in the UK HiFi News complelled me to buy it. One listen was enough. ""Everyone's Gone To The Moon"" has to be heard to be believed."
4,Love side of love/hate,"Very personal and raw music here. ""I Get Along Without You Very Well"" is essential. There's a lot of quirky stuff but I see this album as a gutsy exertion of freedom and honesty. Nina Simone isn't someone I often recommend to soul fans, jazz fans, funk fans, or folk fans. She's really in a category by herself and in most cases, you'll have to come to Nina on Nina's terms. I believe her loneliness on this album."
2,Noisy,"I bought two to replace my back struts because I was told so. I replaced them myself (Ford Focus 2001) and when I took it to the road there was an awful noise coming from the rear end of the car. I checked to see if everything was fine and it was. I took it out (the one I believed was making the noise) and I took it for a ride and the noise was gone. I returned it and installed a new one, problem solved. Anyway, for some reason they are ""noisier"" than stock shocks. I would not recommend these struts to anyone."
3,it is broken,"after two days of using it the ON?OFF switch broke. can no longer turn it on. Now I'm shore that Makita wil honor the waranty but the problem is the hussel of taking it to repair sop, not to mention the downtime."
5,Like it so far,"This is my 1st nibbler. I have only used it a little, but I like it so far. This doesn't cut, it punches, & seems a little hard to keep a straight line but probably just takes getting used to.Follow-up : After several months of use this is a very good tool & works well."
2,Book is kind of outdated,Book is based on 2.4 kernel. Since we are currently at 2.6 kernel this book does seem to have outdated information
2,disappointed,"I read this book in about 2 hours and the contents really disappoint me. I expected the book to discuss in details of the issues related to embedded linux. And to a degree, this book is like a dictionary of all the terms you might encounter during the development and only a few direct examples. And given how fast the Linux kernel, open source packages evolve over time, the examples given in this book is totally outdated.A lot of the topics talked about in this book you probably already faced on the desktop, and would be totally useless to someone who has done projects like LinuxFromScratch.to sum up the new stuff in this book in a few words:Hardware: x86 or ARM, with flash and JFFS2 and UBOOTcross compile using gcc, uClibc, busybox, TinyLoginThe book feels like someone outlined everything and wrote one skin deep paragraph on everything."
4,Good and practical book,This book gets you up and running fairly quickly. Its a good practical book which puts embedded linux systems in context and interesting to build. I would recommend this book even for beginners in Linux and Embedded systems.
5,Useful reference for building or using embedded Linux,"Even if you already have development tools, this text is helpful for administering an embedded Linux device, or for locating applications/daemons to run on an embedd Linux device. This text deals with different architectures, like ARM etc."
5,Pretty nice shoe for the price,"Just ordered these and they are pretty nice shoes for $50. I wear a 14W and order Deer Stags alot for work and these are actually a nicer quality shoe that those are. The 14W Bostonian runs a little longer than the Deer Stags I normally wear, but not too big to have to get the next size down. Not the fanciest or the worst looking shoe around, just a quality shoe at a good price."
3,Missing Important Information,"The qi gong is okay; a bit martial in nature but the main reason I gave this a 3 star, is there is no energetic affects explanation included."
4,Second full length,"Lacking the strength of their first full length release, this record still holds its own. Much slower and more melodic, this work takes one into the strange personaes that make up Morsel. It is strong from start to finish but lacks the heavier drive of the first album. It is a necessity if you are a fan of this band but not the best starting piece if you are new to them. A listen of ""Noise Floor"" or their new release ""Para Siempre"" is a better bet. However, I do highly recommnd this album as it is a great listen for those rainy days when you feel like your life is a wreck."
2,Play Santana DVD,"I found this to be an absolute beginner DVD. He shows a couple of the most simple chord progressions and then shows some minor scales to solo over them in the style of Carlos Santana. What I found to be the most disturbing was that the instructor is playing a Telecaster through a Fender amp. Really? Is that the best effort you could put into the ""sound"". Carlos plays a PRS through a Mesa Boogie. He used SG's in the earlier albums but always plays with humbucking pick ups for that smoother warm sound. A Telecaster is a twangy country clean sound. At a minumum he could have borrowed one. This is one of my peeves because you see others do it too. They use the master's name and then solo over a backing track in his ""style"". If you are a beginner you'll be fine, but he's not doing anything you can't find on u-tube for free."
2,"Could have been great, but WAY TOO MUCH MISSING","Ja Rule, love him or hate him, was one of the biggest hip-hop/pop stars of the late 1990s and early 00s. This greatest hits collection could have been a true testament to the state of popular music in that era, but is way too incomplete. What is missing? One of his biggest hits, and his first number one, ""I'm Real"" with Jennifer lopez. Also missing is the single version of ""Put It On Me,"" which featured amazing vocals from Lil' Mo. How can they have left that one off? That was the HIT version of the song. That is unacceptable. Also missing is his first big big hit, ""Between You And Me"" with Christina Milian. Also missing are the hits ""Down Ass Bitch,"" ""Down 4 U,"" which was another top ten hit, ""Can I Get A..."" with JayZ and Amil, and ""Rainy Dayz"" with Mary J. Blige. They should have made this a 2 CD set and added a few album tracks, like ""Caught Up"" and ""X"" and have made a truly definitive package."
5,Dumbasses,"This guy below me is a straight dumbass! Goes to show u that u really can't go on Amazon.com ratings of albums because dumb people like him write these reviews...and whats even funnier is...they are SERIOUS! about it! Ja Rule been sellin' albums before 50 even came out, Ja didn't have Eminem and Dr. Dre to back him up and Venni Vetti Vicci went 2x Platinum, 3:36 went 3x Platinum, Pain Is Love went 6x Platinum, The Last Temptation went Platinum, his gangsta album Blood In My Eye Went Gold, and R.U.L.E. went Gold. thats about 13 million albums to my records...so Ja has plenty of room to speak."
2,Too much missing,"I lot of the songs are great dont get me wrong, but Ja left off three top ten singles, one of which was a #1 single. The album is missing ""Between Me & You"", ""Down A** B***h"" (Featuring Charli Baltimore) & ""Down 4 U"" (Featuring Vita, Charli Baltimore & Ashanti), all of which I know were top ten singles, the last I believe hit #1 in the summer of 2001. Also where is the track from ""Light it Up"" soundtrack? I was hoping for the remix of ""Holla Holla"" since that got more airplay that a lot of the others. I don't understand how people have a hard time making greatest hits cds, the concept just seems soo easy."
5,Exodus,I dont really understand how u can't give a greatest hits CD 5 stars unless u dont like the artist but if u dont like the artist y would u bother buying the album.This is a great compilation of Ja's greatest hits theres not really much more i can say other then that.There were some new songs which were all great and some of his older songs i wasn't to familar with since i hadn't liked Ja until his Mesmerize days.Anyway go pick up this album if u like Ja's hits or if u like Ja.
1,WHAT THE HELLLLLLL,"TRUST ME I AM NOT TAKING ANYONES SIDE BUT REALLY 50 CENT IS LOT BETTER THAN JA RULE.JA-RULE IS STILL 2PAC WANNA BE. NONE OF THE TRACK IS COOL.POOR BEATS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT BUT BELIEVE ME IF U WANNA HEAR SOME GOOD RAP, BUY ANYTHING BY 50 CENT OR EMINEM.IT IS NOT A RAP ITS CRAP."
1,Ja Rule? Come on man!,"Ja Rule? He has no credibility! Like 50 said, Jay put him on and X made him hot. After that... the love songs, and after that... he already has his ""greatest hits"" album out. D-Block? Outside of NYC, no one knows who they are! Fat Joe and Terror Squad? Stick to wearing the pink fur coat in the pool. The Game? I never liked him, even before he was fired from G-Unit. That dude never had any talent. I like 50's verses on the album and Dr. Dre's beats, thats about as far as that goes. Lil' Kim? Have fun in jail! Bang Em Smurf, why'd you leave? (oh yeah, to the person below: you spelled sneakers wrong! [snakers])"
4,Good collection,"This is a good collection of Ja's best hits all on 1 album. But I gave it 4 stars because it's missing some of his biggest hits (""Between Me & U"", ""I'm Real (Murder Remix)"", ""Down Ass Bitch"", etc). Still worth coppin."
3,pretty good Hits package,"I Only like a Few of Ja Rule's songs on a Whole,but I give Him his Dap for having a style that worked like a Charm.also Congradulations to Irv Gotti&I bet He will Be back. anyway back to Ja Rule:for all that hatin that 50 cent was doing He has basically been a Mini Version of Ja Rule&Mase(who He ended up signing to G-Unit) but anyway there are some cuts that hold up really well.""Wonderful with R.kelly&Ashanti is a tight Joint.Always on time,Livin it up, are catchy cuts. Haters can Hate all they want,but Ja Rule's ""Cookie Monster Vocals"" help create alot of Duet slow Jams that did really well on the Charts.be it with J-Lo,Ashanti,&Others. the jam with Ronald isley ""Daddy's little baby"" is tight.I Miss the Pressence of Lil Mo on here though.they did really well together. this is a Pretty good Overall compilation."
1,Great light while it works.,I tried one of these and really liked how you could swivel the light to point where you wanted it to. Went out and bought quite a few more to use all around the house. Unfortunately none of them lasted more than a few months and you cannot replace the bulb. I also tried a few fluorescent night lights that promised long life but none of them lasted more than a year. Now I am trying out various LED nightlights trying to find one that provides a good light. I have never had an LED light burn out but most either have a lot of glare when there isn't any other source of light or they don't put out enough light to do any good. Still looking.
2,Good Light; Short Life !!!,"I purchased and installed one of these in September, and was pretty satisfied with the light. However, three months later, it stopped working. When I touched it, the light appeared to go on again, but off as soon as I removed my hand.I have had lights similar to this in the past, but all others have lasted much longer than this. I guess I'll plug in the second one to see how long it works."
3,"Worked well, for a while","These little guys are neat. I live in a small apartment, and I have an old dog who likes to fall down the last couple stairs (I'm assuming he can't tell where the stairs end in the dark). We also have visitors, and my girlfriend has frequent trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night. These worked perfectly for illuminating the bottom of the stairs, and also the main hallway to the bathroom. I like that you can rotate them 360 degrees to face wherever you need. The only downside is that I have only had these for about 4-5 months, and one of the has stopped working already. It was acting finicky, turning on if I tapped it, but eventually it stopped working altogether. I also checked out some night lights in the local store, and the prices didn't seem much different. I don't really know if these are worth ordering online."
3,Works but not high quality,"Originally I was debating between this one and the Maxxima one. After reading both product's reviews, I bought the GE one thinking that it will be higher quality. It arrived in good condition, everything worked fine. The light does not turn very well though, I have to go back and forth many times to be able to do a complete 360 rotation. It also feels very easy to break as I was turning the light. Given that I will only turn it once, and probably leave it plugged in and untouched for months if not years, I think it is acceptable. It does project a very warm and comfortable light. Definitely not for anyone who is looking for high quality night light."
1,Not LED and they get HOT!,"These are bound to burn out at some point soon. They get HOT to the touch. Sure, they rotate and give off a warmer light, but that doesn't make up for a potential fire hazard. Returning asap..."
3,"A few gems, but only a few","Most stories are fair, but there are three that are outstanding:""The Machine"" by Jeff VanderMeer is fluid and sharp;""Harvest"" is solid by Carol MacAllister;and ""Slow Mary"" by Brady Allen is a creepy and very Twilight Zone-ish tale that will make you consider speed limits on back roads.Also pretty good is ""Precognitive Myopia"" by Forrest Aguire.Overall, though, it's a little slow."
3,Seems I've seen this before,"Rather than being a study of quilts native to the area in the title, this is a celebration of the collection at the MSU Museum. It includes international textiles and works from Hawaii, as well as American Indian and African-American collections. This diffusion and the resulting explanations make it hard to get very emotionally involved with any of the quiltmakers. In fact, there was a scholarly dryness about all of the text that was unlike many of the state and regional quilt documentation books. The book also includes 12 projects based on quilts in the collection, showing both the original and the new model made by Michigan quilters."
2,Not as advertised,Item was advertised as having both English & Spanish language options and DID NOT.This was the main reason I purchased these & I am very disappointed by themisleading information. Think others should be correctly informed.
4,Welcome to the world of the Medieval Hunt,"Over all, an excellent introduction to the world of the Medieval Hunt. Some knowledge of medieval history and/or study is helpful, as the author does sometimes seem to assume you know what he is talking about. Full of vivid descriptions, (especially concerning the chapters refering to ""Par Force"" hunting) One can almost see the Hunt as it unfolds. The chapters concerning the ""Par Force"" and the ""Bow and Stable"" Hunts are excellantly done with much intricate detail covering everything from how the hounds were taken care of to how much the Huntsman made. This section alone makes the book worth purchasing. The section on falconry, I found was not quite so in depth as the ""Hounds"" section, though it was definately useful and interesting."
4,Frogamania,"Great party CD. Get a bottle of tequila down you and this will be the best dance music since Saturday Night Fever.Seriously - good value, good quality and funky Booker T and the MG's type R&B vibe.Buy it, or you'll miss out on a EXCELLENT buzz."
5,You are there,"This review is for the 1989 video version. This is the BEST. It has a ""you are there"" feel. It covers the mission well, and also has clips of the reactions from members of the public, including Armstromg's family.The ""40th Anniversary"" DVD is a poor version of this."
5,TV History,"I used portions of this program in a course I taught on the ""History of Television"". What particularly makes this product worthwhile is that it features actual, lengthy segments of what Cronkite and his colleagues reported live on television. Images of the moon landing as covered by CBS news are particularly effective in creating for students today the sense of anxiety, excitement and wonder that people throughout the world felt at what the American astronauts were trying to accomplish. Particularly interesting is the sense of pride that countries around the world expressed towards America for its daring and accomplishment, which is so polar opposite to the mood that is being expressed today towards the U.S. (nearly 40-years later) in the wake of the Iraq war and the seeming American indifference towards issues like global warming."
5,A wedding that almost goes up in flames,"Donnelly's unique plots, quirky characters, true-to-life settings, and lively prose make her Wedding Planner series as addictive as chocolate.In DEATH TAKES A HONEYMOON, the fourth installment, Carnegie Kincaid leaves her Seattle houseboat behind to attend the wedding of an old friend in Sun Valley, Idaho. Poor Carnegie soon has a lot on her cake plate: the sinister death of her smoke jumper cousin, her commitment-shy boyfriend, a self-centered celebrity bride and her pill-popping mother, a flirtatious groom, and an annoying rival wedding planner. Woven into the mystery are intriguing facts about smoke jumping, but they never get in the way of the story."
3,"Unique, likeable characters and good plotting","I really enjoy this ""cozy"" murder mystery series, with amateur sleuth/wedding planner Carnegie Kincaid. Deborah Donnelly's story lines are always entertaining and liberally sprinkled with humor at the expense of Carnegie's Bridezilla du Jour.This particular story was a bit convoluted, with a number of new characters dumped on the reader simultaneously. Even at the end of the story, I felt like I needed a scorecard to keep up. All the same, Donnelly does a fairly good job of distinguishing even the most minor of characters.A good, but not overwhelming plot, coupled with a look into Carnegie's past, makes for a solid book. I must say, though, the cliffhanger ending is a bit over-the-top. If Aaron's truly gone, then I say good riddance. I wasn't too thrilled with him anyway."
2,He's Scarier Than Freddie Kruger,"I found this documentary to be extremely disturbing- Ron Holiday should go down in history as one of the all-time scariest ""characters"" in movie history. I've seen a lot of disturbing films/documentaries/movies in my time, but this gave me the willies and still to this day. If anyone out there has seen the video ""CUIDADO!"" ( an extremely horrendous compilation of the most disturbing images/scenes that makes the entire FACES OF DEATH series seem like a Best Of Disney collection), then you will know what I mean when I say avoid this documentary like a disease."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"This adapter was sorely needed as my effects pedal will kill three 9 volt batteries in 3 hours. Works perfectly. Wouldn't hurt if the wire was longer, but can't really complain. Just what I needed."
4,It shoud be included with the pedal,"I dont know why, but this item is not included with de pedal.I bought a Digitech, Hardwire Metal Distortion pedal, the battery included died a week later I received the product.It should be included"
3,It works & saves batteries but over priced.,"It works as it should and saves you money on 9-volt batteries. At this time it is listed around $25.00. Most wall transformers only cost about $10 or less. If you can find another power supply with the same voltage, current rating, polarity and connector size for less money, buy it."
1,faulty,The power adapter quit working after one day and Im not sure why. My Behringer adapter works much better so consider buying a different brand power source
3,Does the job,"I bought this for powering a component in my audio rack. It does the job well. It pretty much just sits there without having to be moved in the back of an equipment rack, so I don't foresee any future problems with it."
2,Broke and ate tapes,We had this unit for six months when it ate a tape and we had to pay to get the tape out. It costs too much to fix so now we have to buy a new unit.
5,BEST EVER!,this is the best user-friendly guide to worship i've ever read. i bought it for a friend who leads worship at her church.
5,Awesome Book on Worship!,"Darlene Zschech is one of the world's top worship leaders. She has a lot of insight and knowledge to offer on worship to me. I love the book, and hope you do too."
5,SWEET TV,"I got this tv to put in my room and hook up my PS2 to. it has worked perfectly. the svideo input in the back makes it real easy to plug in PS2 and picture is awesome. this tv is the perfect tv for anyone who wants a relatively small tv with an s-video input and a flatscreen for a great price.in a word, it's perfect."
4,Joe's best stuff,"Operating for years on the roots rock/folk circuit, Joe Henry didn't just change his sound for this release. He effectively changed the direction he would take on subsequent releases, in effect starting over. While his prior CDs were good and garnered much critical acclaim, there was nothing to prepare the listener for this. I am no die-hard Joe Henry fan, (Scar and Fuse leave me cold) but there is no doubting the brilliance of Trampoline. Every song is impressive, like a greatest hits album of new material. Guest guitarist Page Hamilton from Helmet was a wise choice. Hard to pick highlights here, but two songs that harken back to Joe's country/folk days, ""Go With God"" and ""Parade"" are among the best things he has recorded."
2,NOT aptly named; know what you're getting,"I thought this would be more of an all-inclusive approach to ""everything you need to know about Scoliosis."" However, it is completely focused on surgery - what to do when you're told you need surgery, how to prepare for the hospital, how to recover after, etc. etc. There is nothing on exercise or physical therapy or other modern non-surgical approaches (which much of the other research suggests). There is one small section on bracing. There are so many other books out there on Scoliosis that take a more holistic approach.This is a good book if you know you are getting surgery for your scoliosis, but that's about it. I was very disappointed.A much better resource is this brief pamphlet/book put out by the Scoliosis Care Foundation called The Scoliosis Desk Reference. It is very succinct, w/o any bias for treatment but clear and thorough on the facts, screening, types of scoliosis, treatment options, descriptions from scientific literature, etc."
2,It all sounds so smart,"Browning's book--title and subtitle combined--sounds provocative, interesting, engaging. Then again, I suppose he's learned how to write a headline over the years. This book degenerates into a long, rambling account of all the great sex Browning has had--and then makes an even more telling turn, if not a dangerous one. Browning moves from the personal to the general with fluidity--and there's the rub. The argument is something like this: ""I find community this way, so we all find community this way."" It's that ""so"" that bugs the daylights out of me. It reminds me of Martha Stewart: I make a cake this way, so you must make one this way. Ugh. How self-absorbed can someone get"
2,The jacket cover is more interesting than the text itself.,"Bravo, reader of April, 1997! This is a truly solopsistic essay, very disappointing to someone who is looking for an enlightening discussion."
3,Too Big - maybe my fault,"I have to admit, I'm not sure of the brand of cribbing collar I have. I thought it was a Weaver, but the fleece on this is really loose on the straps. Other than that it's great. Good quality, shipped quickly. I'll probably just try trimming it and sewing it to fit."
2,Informative but a bit dry.,"I'm a student of history, and I didn't really enjoy this book. Yet, I can't really put my finger on why. I learned a lot about the camp life, terminology, food, clothing, discipline, etc of the average Union soldier in the Civil War. However, it would've been much more interesting if the author had woven more first hand accounts, or personal stories of others into the book. This book is a bit dry. For example, instead of writing, ""We made pipes and rings as mementos"" he writes ...""was the making of pipes and rings as mementos..."" (pg 67). I was left wanting to hear the author's story, including the battles he fought in, trouble he got into, etc, while he also brought out all the incidentals of life in the Union Army. I felt the author was standing back describing something somebody else (but nobody he really knew) experienced. Still, if you've got a substantial interest in the Civil War, this represents a lot of information on camp life in one book."
4,Excellent Lite,"Im a firefighter from Chile, and i bought this lite for its reputation among my partners at the firehouse. is really resistant and the light that goes out from the lite is very helpful in smoke and dark enviroments.Nice product.See ya."
5,GREAT BLUES SHOW.....,"I don't usually buy dvd concerts with doing the needed research about the group i'm interested in, so that said, i took a chance on this band without doing any research and boy was i pleasantly surprised. this is a excellent concert. great singing by don ray as well as some stellar guitar playing by the band and guests. this is a straight ahead blues rock show from a very seasoned group. jump on board and take the don ray ride. you'll love it.............."
4,Scottish Generals,"The genealogical material included in this book allows the reader to see that both of these generals were of Scottish extraction, both raised with honor, and both excellent examples of Scottish-American heroes."
1,"One of a Kind, I hope.","If anything, _Bayswater Bodycount_ is a good piece of shlock filth. Mr Gordon successfully sets up a series of rather intriguing premises, which he devalues with a smarmy and racist portrait of contemporary London....Who should read this book? Only those who couldn't find anything more interesting (a computer manual?) in the discount bin at the bookshop. I grieve for such an inexcusable waste of paper and my time."
5,EXCELLENT REFERENCE,"My Sincere thanks and apreciation to Ms. Hawthornewould like to thank her personaly this E book has changed my life I always had a relationship with the lwa but this has been great! I did the Ritual for Papa Legba and everything in my life has changed financialy espiritualy and in every way you can think of, I have Legba right by my door watching my home for me.and Erzuli Freda Blessing me constantly my marriage is full of blessings. Thank God,Lwa, and Eve HawthorneAlso like to point out that you can Print the Book I did."
5,Great carry around,"Not the easiest thing to load pics on, the software is a bit juvenile, but in the end, the little keychain photoviewer is a handy thing to have... takes little space in the pocket, pictures are small, square, but viewable."
2,Hasn't worked yet,When I received it I was unable to load anything. So it is lying on mys desk awaiting a free moment to try again.
2,Cute gadget,"Disappointed with this item, the battery does not hold a charge. Will charge it and by the time I try to turn it on to show off my handsome, beautiful grandchildren the battery has discharged and the unit just turns off."
1,Data does not transfer at all,"I ordered 6 keychains, all working but none of them connected to computer after applying all setting given on different forums like of ""USB Updates"" etc. I tried on 4 different computers/Laptops. It shows the image beautifully comes by default, but its of no use if you can not transfer your own data."
3,Non-working LCD photo keychain (RESOLVED),"Item arrived right about time expected. Since it was a Christmas gift to my mother I never knew this item was deffective. Not until I loaded all the pictures to keychain for my mother I realized there was an issue loading pictures. Amazon contacted this seller, who inmediately contacted me and kindly helped me to resolve the issue with this item."
1,Gargage,I purchased this item for $3 on sale and I still feel cheated. I have the 161 model. It came wth no Usb or software. And the software is currently unavailable for the laptop I'm on (Windows 7). Shouldn't have to put in such effort to use a photo viewer. Flash would be nice. Garbege.
2,Scratches easily,"So at first I was pretty disappointed that it only holds 60 pictures. Yeah, that's what the description says. But it would be better if it was an actual memory size capacity so I could fit more pictures on there by resizing my photos to a smaller resolution. It's so easy to batch-process a bunch of photos and reduce their file size just by resizing for something so small like this.Anyway, the reason for the 2 stars is because this scratches easily. I don't have this attached to my keys, it's way too big. So I clipped this on to the zipper of my breastpump bag so I can look at photos of my daughter while I pump at work. It had a scratch across the front within a few weeks and it totally ruins it. I have no idea how it go there. I don't just throw that bag around because it's a $300 piece of equipment... so this ""keychain"" doesn't seem very durable."
4,Excelent,"Realmente este producto llenó mis expectativas, es cómodo tiene múltiples opciones para ver tus fotos de diversas maneras, ademas de que tiene un encendido y apagado programable para mayor comodidad, lo único malo es que la pantalla no aclara lo suficiente y algunas fotos se ven oscuras y hay que verlas desde un angulo especifico.Por el costo vale la pena, hay una excelente relación Producto-Calidad-Precio."
1,Waste of money and time,"Bought as a Christmas gift so my husband could have pictures of our grandchildren to carry with him, this has now sucked three hours out of my life and is in the trash. It wasted more time than money for me. I'm not an idiot, but I can't make it work. If someone who knows how to use computers can't make it work, then the problem isn't with the user. Amazon shouldn't be selling this piece of crap. No one should."
4,it works,"I was skeptical because of all the negative reviews, but it was cheap at 7.50 so i decided to try it. Well, to my astonishment, when I received it and plugged it into my usb, it just popped up with the program built in. It said to restart but I didnt even have to do that. I just looked for my pictures and dragged it into the usb drive, loaded and it just worked. No problems. Maybe I was lucky with this unit? The pictures are just a bit grainy, but hey, its only 1.5 so no complaints! By the way, my computer is running an AMD x6 1055t on an Asus motherboard with Windows XP sp3 in case people were wondering what my system is for the compatibility."
2,no waht I wanted to buy,"I had bought another one with the exact same spec and ""name"" that was plug&play; and works just fine.I received an older model when you need a CD driver (a mini mode that does not work with my inlaw's CD-ROM reader...Sadly we did not realized that before so the package was already open and dispatch to them or I will have return it."
3,Bought 5. All were difficult to access,"Bought 5. All were difficult to get my computer to recognize which is why I rate it at 3. Each took several attempts and some tricks to access them. Not good if your PC skills are weak. Once you access the built in software, it is fairly easy to use and load pictures. For the price, it may be worth the extra effort."
3,its OK.,"I got what I expected. Since this is cheap, I didn't expect the screen to be ""Super Sleek"" The screen is OK though.It might be too much of a bother, I gave this as a gift for Father's day, but I doubt my Father will use it.but it DOES hold 60 pictures, you need to install an easy program... It is easier than it sounds/looks...but I got used to it within a minute."
2,bad picture quality,"I haven't seen any other of this so I cannot compare, I didn't like the picture quality anyway, I guess they all might look the same.I bought it for my mother, she is happy with it, showing pictures around.I don't like the fact that you have to install a piece of software to reformat and upload the pictures."
4,Great gift for grandparents!,"If all you want is to carry around 40 to 60 photos of the grandkids without much hassle, this is it! However, the software is a little cumbersome and obviously written in Asia, and not all photos can really be made to fit into the horizontal-only format. However, for the price, there's no greater bang for the buck."
1,Digital Picture keychain,Need to read manual carefully to use correctly. Was the same product as advertised and shipped don time. Will buy from company again. Will never buy this product again. It was a waste of money.
2,DIGIAL PHOTO KEY CHAIN,IT DOES NOT STAY CHARED LONG ENOUGH. AND WAS HARD TO GET TO WORK. WE HAD TO CALL FOR HELP WITH IT. I WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN IT IF I WOULD HAVE KNOW THAT ABOUT IT.
3,OK,Pretty good product however battery does not last. Does not always sqrink pic therefore cutting off stuff.but worth the money I bought several for gifts.
1,Received as a gift,"I received one of these last week as a gift from work. I can plug it in and charge it fine, but (as other reviewers have noted)the software CD does not install correctly, the software that does install did not work on either my machine with XP or my Vista machine, and it won't let me do anything until I format the viewer which gives me an error message when I attempt the format (again, noted by othr reviewers). This is my second time dealing with this unit (my mother also received one from her job a few months ago), and the 2nd time it did not function."
3,Serves its purpose,"Its a neat little device. It displays the pictures brightly and in good color. Unfortunately, the software that comes with it is incredibly weak, and the pictures sometimes come out stretched. Overall, it serves its purpose as a lightweight picture display."
3,Good,"I haven't tried to install the software or anything yet, but so far so good...It's little, compact and exactly what I thought it would be...good deal!"
1,Hard to operate,"Not satisfied with the quality or feel of this item, even for the money (about $20). The operating buttons are illegible. You cannot tell if you are pushing the buttons hard enough. I bought 4 for gifts, opened 1 and decided to return all 4 of them. I would not recommend."
1,keychain viewer,"This product seems to be a very good one, however, they do not tellyou that it will not work on a Windows 7 operating system.Usually when stated what system it will work on, if you havea higher version, it will work. Not in this case."
1,It only worked 2 weeks and I had to throw to garbage,"The product only worked 2 weeks, and stop working.It never turn on again.I bought from outside USA, so I had to throw it to garbage.But, it didnt was a big problem, because the image quality is really bad, so I wasn't even looking the photos.Worst product ever!"
2,Cheaply made,This product is cheaply made and it is only a matter of time before it breaks off of my mothers keys. The software on three computers I loaded it on is not 'user friendly' and continues to give errors until it loads...and they you must sync everything as you may not get the software working again. I have a new Dell computer and the technology is there but wait for upgrades of this model!!!
4,Nice little product,"I don't get all of the whining about this product. I did have to drag the software into ""my documents"" but it worked. This thing worked nicely once I got the software installed. Holds 60 pics like it said it would...heck, it works so good I ordered 4 of them and gave a couple of them out as gifts. Every one of us has no problems and everyone we show them too wants to know where to get one. I'm not saying EVERYONE should get out there and buy one but after ordering 4 and having no problems like a bunch of others out there..maybe, just maybe it's the user that is the problem. A little computer knowledge may help, or having someone with you that does have some computer knowledge to help you get started."
1,coby digital usless picture key chain,This coby digital picture key chain was the most usless product that I have ever bought. After spending hours trying to download the software to place pictures on the keychain for my mother for a cristmass gift I had to consult a computer expert before we both agreed the product and software do not work. coby should contact every customer who purchased this usless produce to apologize for wasting their valuable time. Never again would I buy a coby anything.
3,SEEMS NICE.,I purchased this as a Christmas gift. I also received a different brand of this product as a Christmas gift. Comparing the two the Coby had a much nicer appearance. It's veiwing screen is larger and clearer than the one I received. The other brand held more photos but if you can't see them well then what difference does that make.
4,Nice Little Gadget,I think that for the money this is a great product. It is not the best quality out there but it definitely serves it's purpose for almost half the price of most other keychains. The picture is slightly grainy but you can see the details of most photos. The 60 photo storage capacity is very nice. It is pocket/purse size and very convenient for showing off your latest pics! The software is easy to use but be sure the follow the exact steps as stated in the handbook in the order they are listed or you will get an error message!
3,Coby Photo Key Chain,I purchased 2 of these key chains and had no problems setting up or loading one of them. But I was unable to turn on the other one and need to return or exchange it.
1,Don't waste your time,"I read the reviews and should have listened. First, I had trouble getting my computers (I tried more than one) to recognize the device. When it did, I managed to download a few photos. After I had, the screen on the keychain went blue and stayed that way. I tried customer support and they simply e-mailed the instruction manual that came with the keychain. I guess you get what you pay for (or even less)."
4,Neat Device,"Instructions for using the software is lacking. If you get ""Can't find any photoviewer"" error, plug in the device, turn it on and select ""USB Update"", then run the software. Do a Fix size or Free size selection on all your pictures and the will appear in the correct proportions. Otherwise they may be stretched out of shape."
4,"Product works, software does not!","After reading many mixed reviews, I decided to give this product a try. When I received the keychain, I installed the software and attempted to follow the directions with no luck. After a call to the manufacturer technicial support, I was told that the software which comes with the keychain does not work. I was directed to download a driver from the company's website, which after some additional directions worked fine.The quality of the keychain is good for the size, and other than the difficulty of picture downloading I have no complaints. On the positive side, the customer service department was very helpful."
1,A piece of junk,"It is supposed to work on Macs running OS X but the software crashes when you click the popup box that tells you to make sure it is plugged in. Called customer service and they told me to restart my computer and reinstall the software, then restart it again. Still didn't work. Tried it on two other Macs running slightly different versions of OS X still didn't work. This was purchased at a Big Lots store so that should have been a clue that Coby is dumping their defective product."
2,Doesn't work with Mac OS X,"I was very excited to get this product (Coby DP- 151, digital photo key chain), and wanted to download pictures of my kids for my mother for Christmas. The software downloaded fine, I was able to transfer pictures to the software, but when I went to download the pictures to the photo key chain the application quit. Tried several trouble shooting techniques with no luck, including going to Coby's website. Called Coby and was informed that there is a glitch with the software for Mac computers. So this product will not work for me. I do have to say that the website was easy to navigate and customer service at Colby was quick, friendly, American, and helpful. But don't buy this product if you have a Mac unless you verify the software will work first."
3,Problems on a Mac,"The frames seem Ok, but don't seem to be compatible with any OSX version other than 10.3. I have two of these keychains and they work on one of my Macs but not on the other. The one they work on is a G5 running 10.3.9 and they the one that the fail on is my Intel running 10.5.6. I'm guessing that at least for now they are limited to 10.3.x given 10.3 is what is referenced in the documentation."
3,Can't get mini disc to load into a side loading CD reader,I gave this keychain to a friend for her birthday. She called me over one day because she couldn't get it to load into her side loading cd player. This product comes with a mini cd software disc. The mini disc is too small for her side loading cd reader to read. She must need some kind of mini cd adapter for her reader to be able to read it. Maybe we'll try to copy the disc to a standard sized cd so she'll be able to use it.
5,We Love This Thing,"I got one for my wife and we liked it so well that I ordered one for my Sister in Law, Her two daughters and also one for our great neice..."
1,coby- digital photo keychain,"I bought two of these products, one for me, one as a gift. I was very upset with the product. the CD did not get installed, my laptop didn't recognize the product. I got a message that the disk can not be formatted."
2,Not works for mac and not good image quality,"I bought this as a small gift, however, when I received this, I was disappointed.It only works on windows, for mac it is not easy to upload the photos, plus the image quality is not good."
2,not good,Not good at all' bought 2 of these and after a week they just stopped working.I would not recomend this item. Waste of money!!!
1,Doesn't Work,This product doesn't work. I plugged it into the USB to charge and when it finally charged it took forever to get it to connect to the computer. When it finally connected and I uploaded some pictures it wouldn't turn off. The battery ran down again and I plugged it into the computer and then wouldn't disconnect from the computer. I unplugged the USB cord and the keychain still had the white screen with USB connected so I let the battery run down again hoping this would fix it and it won't turn on again. Don't waste your money.
4,Pocket conversation piece,"This is rather new to me, but I think they might catch-on in the near term. You just don't know sometimes what you're going to get for $12.95. There are no batteries to fool with, and loading the software to run on your PC is so simple. I'm impressed with the program as you can grab a full face view from a crowd of people to make a full screen picture of your subject. Click here, stretch there and your done. It evens charges through the USB cable."
3,Digital Photo Key Chain,I had problems downloading the software on my computer for this unit. I had to contact the seller for assistance. I had no problem downloading another model onto my computer. The picture quality is pretty good and the price is comparable to other models.
4,digital photo keychain,the program needed in order to transfer photos onto the keychain was easy to download and use. the pictures came out pretty good also
5,Coby Digital Key Chain,This item came in condition posted and was delivered very quickly. They will be used as gifts for my wedding party. I think they will be well liked.
2,Does Not Work On Mac OS X 10.5,"The reason why I am giving this Coby Digital picture frame keychain only two stars is because it is not Mac compatible if you are using Leopard - Mac OS X 10.5. If you have a system running Tiger - Mac OS X 10.4 - as I luckily have, you will have no problems using this Keychain. It seems to me that Coby's support is just a twee bit lacking. However, I find little fault with the chain itself. I think the quality of the LCD display is more than acceptable, and it's simple enough to use. What I do not like about the keychain is that you have to tell it to charge the battery once you plug it into the included USB chord (which, of course, needs to be plugged into your computer, too). That should be automatic, IMHO. Also, while it is charging, it endlessly cycles through it's stored pictures. On a frame this small, that just seems a waste."
3,Ok for an inexpensive gift,"If you are seeking for an inexpensive but personal gift, this is it. It hardly gets cheaper than $10 while making it personal. But be aware that the quality is not amazing: the square LCD is the least of your concerns, really. The software to let you select and upload (download, in the language used by the program) pictures to the device is painful to use: no drag-and-drop functionality, at least not in the Mac version. So you may find yourself spending a good hour in order to select 45-some photos (it lets you upload a max. of 60) and maybe 20 seconds uploading... er, downloading them on to the device.Anyway, at the end of the day, you get what you pay for: for $10 this is a fairly decent digital photo key chain."
1,Absolute technical junk!,"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my wife to put the kids' pictures in them. I saw all the mixed (though trending toward negative) reviews, but for just over $10, I figured what the heck. Now, I wished I'd heeded some of the comments. This thing would not get recognized in Vista SP1, constantly connecting then disconnecting with that oh-so-catchy USB jingle. There was no software CD provided. I tried everything I could to get my computer to see it, following the directions in the packaging plus some of those given in these reviews. Nothing, nada, zilch.This was the first and will likely be the last Coby product I purchase. Save your money or spend just a little extra to get a product that will actually work reliably for you."
3,Windows Vista,I have Windows Vista and after a hour of pulling my hair out trying to get the CD to work I went on the cobyusa.com website. I was able to load the software through the website and I now love the keychain. It is very simple to download the pictures to the keychain. My whole problem was getting the CD to work (which never did). Keep trying you will love the keychain after you get the pictures on it. I am loading 3 of them for Christmas presents for my in laws and a brother in law.
4,Cool gadget,Very cool gadget -- images are clear and crisp. Software was a little hard to get installed and working but I did get it. Recommend!
3,little difficult to load software,"If it hadn't been for reading Deana Roy's review, I would have sent this back. Once I followed her instructions on getting it to work, it was easy to use. The pictures aren't too bad looking. The higher the resolution of the picture, the sharper they look on the keychain. It's a fun little gadget and much easier than carrying around a wallet full of pictures."
5,Nice Gift,"I bought this for my brother-in-law. He travels a lot for his job. I thought it might be nice for him to take on trips. My niece and I easily loaded it with family pics on Christmas Eve and gave it to him on Christmas. The whole family enjoyed looking at the photos. We all liked the fact that it is rechargable, and holds so many photos. My brother-in-law travels with a laptop, so we can email him photos and he can load them on his keychain."
1,Avoid at any cost,"Good luck with this product and with Coby tech support.I bought two, one powered on while the other did nothing.Neither transferred and the software bundled was horrible, rarely did it recognize the product that would power on.I tried on XP Home, XP Pro and Vista... All the same result.Good idea horribly executed, good news is Amazon makes returns easy."
3,Not a bad deal,"I bought this product for my Mom. I added pictures to it for her as I'm pretty sure she wouldn't figure it out. It's pretty easy to work with, but I def think it can use some improvement on the uploading part of the process. Seems like there is 1-2 steps more than need be and it would be easier to just add pics right from your camera. I was pretty surprised that this little keychain holds 60 pictures. All in all, not a bad deal."
2,software failure,"Had difficulty with software, even after talking with company. Returned item without any difficulty. Good company to deal with."
4,"It won't work at first, but KEEP TRYING","Lots of people will tell you this won't work on XP or Vista or other operating systems. I had so much trouble at first I was going to send it back. I even called tech support and the operator said, ""I'm probably not supposed to say this but these are not very working very well.""BUT, I kept trying, and lo and behold--it DID work! First load the software. Then plug it in and select ""USB upload."" You have to literally keep plugging and unplugging the device until you get that little miracle beep that signifies that your computer found new hardware. Until you hear that, keep plugging and unplugging! The software will NOT work unless it is plugged in and found. But load it anyway, and wait for the lovely beep.After that it works very easily. And it's beautiful!"
1,Cheap and very cheap,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she thought it was cute and liked it. Now, only a month later, the blasted thing won't shut off and will not upload any new pictures. Sur it will let you delete as many as you want that are already stored on it... and though there should be room in the end... no dice... spend the extra bucks.. get something nicer."
4,I was frustrated with it at first......,"I wanted this keychain so bad to carry my Grandson's pictures around with me.I'm not gonna lie, I was so frustrated when I tried to set the software up on my laptop. I thought I would have to return it, but I decided to give it a try on my office computer the next day and if I needed to I would call Coby for technical support. It ended up working on my office computer, but the operating manual is horrible, It was a lot of trial and error to get it working. Here's what I learned, first install your software then reboot your computer. Plug the device into the computer before running the program (otherwise it will say it doesn't recognize the device). I went home that night and set it up on my laptop and it did work. It probably only deserves 3 stars but in the end, I LOVE IT!"
1,Coby DP-151 1.5 Inch Digital Photo Keychain,"This was one of the most difficult pieces of electronics to work with. It took hours to load photos because of poor instructions and poor cables. The directions on how to use the product were not clear, and when trying to call customer service for help, no one answered after 30-45 minutes. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,what a P.O.S,Don't pay more than 20.00 for this thing . I got 3 for my family and only after 2 hours did I get THIS THING TO WORK SOMEWHAT they sold this whit out really testing it.
4,Photo Editing Required,"I gave this to my mom and she loves it. I loaded the pictures for her because I know she would have trouble with it. If you just try to dump pictures on this, they will look like crap. For them to look good, I opened the pics I wanted to add in Microsoft Paint and selected a square around the area I wanted to show and saved it as another image. You should focus on close ups of people's faces, no further than from the waist up, otherwise it gets pixilated and there is no detail. If you want to get fancy, you can tweek the picture's contrast for better results. Many of my family members are whiter than white, so they can be tough to see. You might also have to change contrast if your family is at the opposite end of the color spectrum. It charges using the USB, so you shouldn't give this to someone that doesn't have a computer."
2,well... technically it does work,"...but not on the Mac (they ought to take ""OS X"" off the packaging).And you have to be in the mood for a fun trial-and-error session, since the documentation, software, and english translation are hilariously bad. For instance, if you ever do get to the point where you've finally transferred photos to the thing you see the strangely perky message ""Transfer completely!"""
1,Does not work on Mac OS X! (Leopard),"All I can say in the product's favor is that the two stock photos provided on the keychain itself look very nice. That's because the Photo Viewer software provided for the keychain does not work under Mac OS X (Leopard). After downloading the version of the SW on Coby's site (the mini-CD is useless to me, as I have a slot-loading CD drive), I fired it up only to have it tell me that the keychain must be connected and in update mode, then quit when I hit ""OK.""This is regardless of whether or not the thing actually *is* connected and in update mode.Maybe it's a great product, but I'll never know. Too bad I had to hack and slash the packaging just to get it open... not sure if I'll be able to get a refund.If you own a Mac, stay away, even though it advertises compatibility on the package. You'll be disappointed."
3,Barely satisfied,"Wife found it much too small to view group photos otherwise OK. Easy to use, easy to carry.Worth the price."
1,Pictures do not load,bought 2 of this item as a gift for kids. could not load pictures. customer service was no help and rude. They did not have proper instructionss on how to deal with the problem. When i asked for a supervisor they transfered me to a voicemail. Very unhappy with the unit as well as the customer service of coby elecrtonics. second problem i had with them will never recomend a coby product to anyone.
3,frustrated,"Coby 1.5-Inch Digital Photo Keychain (White)After trying for two weeks to download pictures and a phonecall to Coby, I finally downloaded the instructions from www.cobyusa.com and found it easy.. but even after all that could only download max of 6 pictures, tried many, many times. sooooooooooo frustrated. pictures that I did download are very clear, just wish I could have sownloaded more."
4,Tips for if it wont instal!!!,"I bought two of these for family chirstmas gifts. I wanted to upload some pictures to personalize them before giving them away. I opened the package and spent a good two hours very frustrated because the CD would not load on either of my two IBM computers--there was some issue with the installing. I was about to give up when I starting surfing the internet for tips. I went to [...] .Go down the page and click on ""Digital Photo Keychain"" then clicked on the Download link next to ""Install Soft ware-Zip File for Windows"". After that it worked like a dream and i'm thinking of getting one for myself..pretty cool!"
3,Decent digital keychain,"I wasn't sure how this item was going to be being it was so inexpensive. The picture is not crystal clear, but very decent. I bought this for a birthday gift for my niece on her 12th birthday and she loved it. It is not top quality but a great gift for a young adult. I would hightly recomend this item!"
5,Great Price!,I purchased this as a birthday gift because it was such a great price. I'm definately going to keep ordering from Amazon!
4,I really like this keychain!,"It was a little confusing at first because it was a new type of techie thing for me, but its really cool and has a nice picture display that comes out pretty clear. I would buy another for a friend as a gift or something."
2,Ok but beware!,"Bought this as a gift for my mum to fill with grandson shots. The overall quality is not great but it does to the trick and mum was very happy with it to show her friends.About 2 weeks later a dark spot developed in the centre of the screen. Tried to adjust contrast etc. but nothing worked.I did not expect amazing quality, but also did not expect it to break down so quickly.Be Warned!"
1,Stopped trying after a month,I bought 5 of these items last Christmas when they were on sale. 4 were gifts and I kept one for myself. Read the reviews- thought may be I would have better luck. I stopped trying to set it up after about a month of trying and a year later it is still sitting in one of my drawers unused and looking brand new. I am afraid to ask my friends and relatives whom I had given the photo keychain as gifts if it worked for them - I am afraid they'll get upset with me. I will try plug in and unplug it as suggested by one of the recent reviewers.
1,Coby Photo Key Chain Never Worked,"I purchased the Coby 1.5 inch digital photo key chain for my wife for Christmas, it was a stocking stuffer. Well, my original suspicions were true, and that is that this type of gadget is not going to be easy to use and is not going to have much tech support. It did not respond according to the directions and when I called customer service over 3 different times I was put on hold and or was dropped. Yes, I was calling after Christmas so I am sure the call volume was more than usual, but I called as late as January 7th and still no luck. I sent the item back to Amazon and they were very cooperative to accept the return."
1,A good idea but.,The idea for this unit is very good but the finished product don't live up to the idea.
1,nah,"save your time and money, not sure why we purchased this product, perhaps it is the spur at the moment"
4,Little great product,It is great to hang it on a women purse.The screen it is good for the price.The software to move the pictures may would be complicated.
1,Don't bother with this product,"Just received this keychain, and after charging it I can't get it to respond. It's frozen. I called Colby's tech support number. Sat. hours were listed as 9-5est.( I called at 11am)and they were closed.I don't think I will bother with this keychain, not worth the frustration."
1,HATE IT! Don't buy it!,COBY DP151: I have had this for a month and have spent way too much time trying to figure out how to get pictures on this thing. I am still unsuccessful.This thing is a usability nightmare. Don't buy it!
1,Zero Customer Service,"Looked like a nice gadget for the money.But screen not very bright, even with a new battery charge.Thought that there might be a setting or adjustment possible.Tried writing the mfg. customer service/support (given on their website), and received no reply after two tries.Also found the name of a ""higher up,"" but again not even the courtesy of any reply.Overall, a Medioce product from a mediocre organization."
1,Doesn't work,Don't bother buying this item. I bought two of them for Mother's Day and Father's Day. I couldn't get either of them to work and I tried them on two different computers. I called the customer service number and the person I talked to said he didn't know why it wasn't working. That was the only help I got. I definitely wouldn't waste your money on this. I ended up just throwing them away because the original packaging has to be destroyed in order to get them out.
3,Inexpensive but the screen isn't very good,"This is an inexpensive item so I didn't expect too much from it but the screen is really grainy and dull. However, the software to transfer pictures from the computer worked for me without any trouble."
3,Nice Novelty Item,"This is good item for novelty gifts or inexpensive pot luck gift events etc. I gave it three stars because when the slide show is running it looks as if there are faint lines running through the pictures. Not pronounced, but more like the lines are part of the keychain background or they are a faint design in the display screen itself.That little observation aside, the the keychain holds 60 pictures and they are displayed via a continuous slideshow. No problem loading the pictures on to the keychain. My laptop recognised it as soon as it was plugged in. The drivers installed and the software loaded that allowed me to select the pictures which I wanted to load.The viewing area is small 1 1/8"" x 1 3/8""I bought this on a whim. It's a nifty gadget and I like it."
3,Work as expected to work,I bought 4 piece of this item and 3 of them worked as it was expected to work. One piece was dead on arrival. I liked it as Easy to use. Software gives trouble occasionally even on Win 7 but works fine if remove the USB and plug it again.What I don't like is that it doesn't show photo on full screen. It feels kind of empty screen and loose the glamor out of it otherwise I don't find any issue with this.
1,Poor Product,"I purchased two of these items for gifts. Both did not work on any of the 4 computers I have. I spent an hour on the phone with Coby technical support before they declared them defective. Amazon was great and sent me two new ones in time for Christmas (TIP use their 800 number, it is much better for service). The two new ones I received also had software issues. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."
1,Piece of junk,I ordered this for my sisters. I can't get it to work on either mac or PC. Searched the internet for solutions but nothing is working on either computer. Actually got several of them (have several sisters). None of them are working so I know it isn't the computer. Went to Coby website and downloaded the most current driver. Still nothing. Don't waste your money!
1,did not work and no response from manufacturer,Save your money and try another brand. This item never worked and the manufacturer would not respond to my inquiries.
1,Software doesn't work,"Installed software and tried to run it as per instructions. Error says the software isn't installed. Uninstalled it and reinstalled. Still the same error. Uninstalled, downloaded program from the manufacturer's website. Installed. Ran program, same error. Computer won't detect the item when plugged in. Useless garbage."
3,"A little tricky at first, but ok now","I too had trouble with the software that came with this, but I emailed tech support and they got back to me right away with a file to help. I'm not sure if it would be so easy if you're not computer savy, but I seemed to do fine. The pics look great and there is a lot of room on this. The only other problem I had is that the chain keeps breaking. My mom keeps it in her purse now because it fell off her keychain a couple of times so she doesn't want to lose it."
1,Would Not recommend,I bought this as a Christmas gift in October. Lasted 1 month and now the company won't replace it because of 90 day warranty. Then it would have cost me more to send it back than it cost me to buy it. Coby does not stand behind it's product. Would not give this company another dime of my money.
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"Uncompatible software, very confused instruction, bad customer service(it is said open on Sunday but the call has no answer)"
2,ehhh....,"well what can i say it was only like 15 dollars but it's got a horrible little screen and it's very flimbsy, buttons don't work to well either... but i gave it 2 stars because it arrived on time and it works!"
2,"Fragility, Thy Name Is Coby","Although being a nice way to carry photos around, it is much too fragile to be used as a key ring. Mine broke within a week. Also, you'd better select only close-ups, as anything from medium shots to long shots tend to be almost impossible to see. Otherwise, it was okay for the price."
1,Bad Software,"The software that came with it did not work at all. We downloaded the latest version from the Coby support site and installed it. It would start, but could not find the device, even though Windows saw it. After a lot of research, finally broke down and sent email to Coby tech support with everything we had tried. That was 2 weeks ago and still no response. I would not recommend this product."
4,Great Value,I have had mine now for a month and had no problems as of yet. A great value for only 75 Pepsi Points!!
2,ehh for pepsi points its ok,"I wouldnt have spent 15 bucks on it, but i got it for pepsi points, the screen is small and the colors are dim, other than that it was very easy to set up."
1,zero customer service,Don't buy from them. They send the wrong stuff and customer service is non existant. SAve your self the head ache
3,Coby 1.5-Inch Digital Photo Key Chain (Black),The keychain is a Christmas gift. It looks really nice in the package and it arrived well before Christmas.
1,Piece of Junk!,"Don't waste your time or money on this contraption. I am fairly computer savy and thought that I could definitely use this product with ease. The problem is that the computer won't even recognize the device. You can't possibly download anything to it if the computer doesn't even realize it's there. Basically it is a piece of trash now because I still have made no progress with it. I also bought the Jwin digital photo key chain and it worked beautifully. No problems, easy to use and very nice quality! If you want a digital keychain, go with the Jwin."
2,"Just 26 trys, Never turn it off","I just try to turn it on 26 times, plugin and unplug it... It works...i Just turn it off by mistake, it is not turning on, just like the beganing"
3,have to download updated driver from coby site,"At first, I was going to return this. The software would not install and the computer did not detect the device. (Using a Vista OS.) I gave it to my sister and asked if it would install on her computer. Instead of using the CD that comes with it, she went to the Coby website and downloaded the most recent drivers (COBYUSA.com). It worked! She, too, has a Vista. I have to say, I was glad to find out that Amazon would have paid for me to send it back, if it had come to that.I gave it 3 stars because the average ""digital immigrant"" would not know to go to the Coby website for a more recent driver. My sister has a lot of experience fixing computers, so that is why she knew how to get this product to function."
5,How to make it work! Please read first!,"Here is how to get it working on vista:1. install software from CDNote: do not run Photo Viewer yet - it will just fail if the keychain is not plugged-in.2. plug-in the keychain to the PC using the USB cable3. on the keychain hilight ""USB Update"" (hit one of the left/right buttons) and action it (the middle button)Note: On the PC you must see ""installing driver"" bubble or something is wrong. I did not get the bubble with the provided USB cable. I switched to another USB cable I had already (from my camera) and it worked I could see the bubble.4. run ""Photo Viewer"" (start menu->all programs->Photo Viewer)Note: If photo viewer opens then it can see the keychain correctly.Now, follow the instructions on how to select, crop and ""download"" photos to the keychain.I'm very impressed with the keychain, I bought 3 of them as Christmas gifts for family members."
1,I AGREE! DON'T WASTE PEPSI POINTS *OR* MONEY ON THIS!,I used 75 Pepsi points to get this item. I can NOT get it to work under Mac OS or Windows. I've searched online and found that SO many people are having problems with this unit. They contact Coby and are not given any resolution to the problem. I've contacted Coby and don't expect resolution ... and I've also contacted Amazon about returning this piece of trash. I'm disappointed Amazon has this item here being there are SO many complaints! Now what? I get my 75 Pepsi points back and only have til 12/31 to use them? I'm NOT a happy camper. Very frustrated and angry about this product and situation! AVOID THIS ITEM LIKE THE PLAGUE ! ! !
4,Mom likes it!,"I bought this for my mom, who loves pictures. She is not very computer savy but she loves it. She said it was real easy to install and use."
4,great little key chain,I bought this for my grandfather for Christmas and loaded pictures of all his great grand children on there because he love to carry pictures of the kids. the only draw back is to charge it you have to connect it to the computer which he does not have so I have to charge it for him. He loves it.
1,Item did not work,"We were unable to make the Digital Photo Keychain [Coby DP-1.5]work. The instructions were usless and finding instructions on the ""net"" did not help either. We returned it and were not happy to hear that there is a 6 to 8 week wait for our money, also a 15% re-stocking charge and we pay for the shipping. They make it very difficult to find the phone numbers to call and to return an item. Alltogether a very bad experience."
5,Great Gift!,"Gave this as a Christmas present to sister-in-law, she loved it. The picture quality is great. Very easy to load and use. Now I want one for myself. I have seen many similar items out there but none are comparable for the price. This is not a piece of junk or tacky looking, which many in this price range seem to be. Will be purchasing this item again."
2,Viewer Good Software Crap,"As with several other reviews, loaded software, updated software, unloaded software, reloaded.... Finally got through to tech support who admitted the sofware is not really working very well and gave me a list of the quirks. One of which was jam all the connections together as hard as possible. In the end, its working and I'll keep it, but what a waste of 3 hrs getting there."
2,"Coby DP-151 1.5""","I was not over joyed with this product. I had trouble downloading the program and had to email Coby to get a different set of instructions. The picture is not the best, not that clear. I guess for the amount of $ you get what you pay for."
3,It's just OK.,The drivers for this product don't work on mac (I've tried several machines). And the Windows interface isn't real user friendly either. Too bad since the device itself is kind of nice.
2,installation difficult,Coby 1.5-Inch Digital Photo Keychain (White)We were unsuccessful installing the software and loading pictures using the enclosed disk. We went to the Coby internet site and downloaded current software and more specific installation instructions and were finally successful. It shouldn't take several hours of frustrating effort to install a $12 product. Displays photos ok after all the labor.
4,It is what it is,"It is worth the price for what it is, a nice small thing to carry pics on your key chain with. I noticed other reviews that had problems with the install of the software but I had no problem with it to a Vista OS. If you want the whole pic to show, you have to use some type of photo program (I use PhotoImpact 8) to expand the canvas size to square dimensions. Other than that it is fairly decent."
2,A Good Idea But....,"This is a cute little key chain and the concept of having photos with you is great, BUT the software is not very user friendly. I had to spent a lot of time getting it to work with XP. Obviously there are others with the same problem since the company's online support is dedicate to software problem resolution. Why not just resolve the issues so people don't have to seek help? Not worth the hassle."
3,It's just okay,I had a few problems getting the software to work with XP but it's up and running. For the price the Photo Keychain is okay. I didn't find the picture quality to be very good and I doubt if I will ever use the keychain because of the poor picture quality.
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money,I purchased this as a Christmas present. We tried to load photos using a Mac and an XP PC. We tried all the tricks that other reviewers have tried. Nothing worked. Neither computer system recognized the USB cable. I was fortunate to send it back for a refund. Very disappointing!
1,Stopped working almost immediately,"I had no problems uploading pictures to this device. However, the problem is is that it doesn't want to hold a charge. I plug it into the USB port for several hours and then when I try to turn it on again a day or two later it won't turn on and needs to be charged again. The product specifies that the charge should last for 4 hours."
3,Good but I wish its had more down load options,The price is great but the software to download pics with is very limited. You can't down load a few pics then add more later. Its all or nothing.Other than that its easy to use and it is making a great gift for those people that have evrything.
3,always low battery,I thought it wold be nice to put a few pics in it so i can show my friends my pictures..but seems the battery only works once in a day and when u turn it on and see the pics once then it gives the alert 'low battery' then turn itself off..so its battery is good for 1 or 2 minutes then thats it..no battery..for me its not as practical as i thought.emel
1,Not good,"this keychain seems good for the money, but isnt worth the hassle. it locks up when trying to put photos on it, then you can shut it down, you have to let the battery die and recharge it."
1,"NOT RECOMMENDED, HARD TO USE","This is extremely hard to set-up! I still have not been able to use it (had it for several weeks). Charged it as per instructions, but when I try to set it up, it says it can't find the program (I have Windows XP). Have tried many times with no luck. I do not recommend this product. Instructions with it do not work when you follow them."
1,Junk,I purchased the Coby 1.5-Inch Digital Photo Keychain for a Christmas gift. The person that received the gift is unable to get the software to work. There is a number to call for Tech Support but that hangs up when you are about the second person waiting to talk to someone. The recording will say no one is available please try your call later. That is not good when you have been waiting on the phone for a while. I think that it is time that they updated their software.
1,waste of money,"I ordered this for xmas, thought it would make a nice stocking stuffer. Well, i wanted to upload some favorite pics into it, before putting in the stocking & it won't even work on my laptop (I'm running Windows 7) The thing doesn't even show up as being plugged in, there's no software to use because it's supposed to be installed in the keychain but that won't even run when plugged in at all.Total waste of money. Beware before buying this, when people say it doesn't work, they aren't wrong. It doesn't work at all."
1,Product does not work with Windows XP,"This product does not work with Windows XP even though it clearly states it on the package.I went to the website and downloaded the updated driver, and still no luck.I will be returning this product."
1,Forget it!!!,"I could not get this item to download my pictures from Windows 7. I returned all 3. Good idea, but it didn't work for me."
1,Battery is not replaceable,"This worked fine 'till the battery died (About 9 mos.) The battery gets used up even when not in use. I saw the photos only once. When I tried to replace the battery, I discovered it is not a standard battery and is soldered in. This device is disposable. Don't buy it."
1,BAD,THIS CHAIN SUCKS I CAN NOT LOAD ANY PHOTOS IT WONT LET ME.Coby 1.8-Inch Digital TFT LCD Photo Keychain DP180BLK (Black)
1,This is K. R. A. P.,"ORDER A FEW FOR STOCKING STUFFERS.THEY WORK ONE CHARGE THEN NOTHING.CANT RECHARGE.CANT USE USB.NOTHING.EXPENSIVE KEY CHAIN.CALLED coby, THEY WANT YOU TO SHIP AT YOUR EXPENSE WITH A $6 MONEY ORDER PER ITEM TO REPLACE.coby IS KRAP!"
2,Too hard to get things rolling :),Got this mothers day for wife. She had a very hard time getting things to work. It's definitely not a 123 go product. After messing around with it for around 40 minutes we got it to work. A little too tricky of a device/software for us :). After a second time of trying to copy some pictures to it we decided it was best just to give it away to someone who doesn't mind trying to figure how to rub it the right way.
1,poor customer service and quality,"I bought 2 of these key chains for presents and neither of them worked as they were supposed to (not at all).called the sellers CS and they told me that they knew that they had sent the wrong software along with it. and that they would send me the correct one. no apologies, no nothing even though the people I had given the key chains to had received defective items.seller sent supposedly, the right software but after downloading, loading it and spending even more hours trying to make it work and more calls, it appeared they had sent the wrong software again!the seller then indicated on the 4th call that I could return the items at my expense.I called the manufacturer then and they indicated I go to their website to download yet another program.the key chains never worked. I put a star next to the review because the review does not go through without a rating."
2,Coby DP-151 digital photo keychain,The devise works pretty well and the display isn't too bad either. But I wasted about a week trying to get this to work. Coby's support was abosolutely terrible. Emails to their support site with the details of the problems only resulted in automated messages from a computer with suggestions of what to try. Even reporting back that I've tried all their suggestions resulted in the same response. Their final suggestion was to have me go buy another USB cable and see if it resolves the problem. I later found out that many of these devises are packaged with bad USB cables. I used one from my camera and it finally worked.
4,The cord did not allow me to download but a different cord did...,I plugged the cord into my laptop (HP Pavilion g7) it did nothing. I tried numerous times. Then I thought to myself...it's not my laptop because it is new so I got the cord that came with my sisters photo keychain (not the same brand) and it work right away. So just a fyi... if you are having issues it could just be the cord.
3,Great,Little but good. Price good. Others are better. Good quantity of pictures. Good image. Easy usability. Beatiful and good material
2,Does not work with Windows 7,"I really liked this product. The device itself seems well built and had two factory photos on it that showed how nice the pictures could have been. That being sad, the software WILL NOT work with windows 7. I tried to re-download the required driver from coby's website, but it did not work. Oh well. It was a nice thought."
3,Worth of the money,"I purchased this keychain as a present for my wife, she is OK with the gift, but I expected it to be a little bit better. Quality on the display is not good,though the photos I uploaded on the device are of good quality.I would mention that the device works well with Windows XP, I had no problem with operation of it, or sharing photos from my computer.It's still not bad purchase, it's worth of the money you pay for it."
5,Neat little item.,"For her birthday,I gave my wife a photo keychain loaded with photos from our daughter's recent wedding. It was easy to download the photos from my computer and the device is ideal for the purpose she had wanted one, which was to have a convenient way to show some wedding photos to acquaintances she encountered when they ask about the wedding."
1,Software is a joke...,I could not get the software to download no matter what I did. I tried to download it from the site but it kept coming up with an error. I also wrote the tech support an email 3 days ago for help and have not heard back at all. Then I try and call but the day before Christmas Eve they're already closed! I would honestly use more colorful language if I could. I wanted to give it to my mother but now I don't know what to do. The day before Christmas Eve I have to go out and buy another one!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM- IT IS DEFECTIVE,I bought 2 of these as presents- tried to charge them both in order to upload pics- neaither of them works- i have windows 7- they really suck- waste of your money
1,Could live without it,I purchased it as a gift and had a feedback after a couple of days that its broken. Probably due to packaging. Did not work at all. Wont buy one of its kind again.
3,it's ok but can't load software b/c of small instruction cd,"I love the idea of this product but the fact that the instruction cd is only 3"" wide and I have a laptop- I am unable to load the software to actullay use the product. I am sure it would be a great product and easy to use if I could actually load the software on to my laptop to be able to use it. I am unable to speak to picture quality or image size. I now have to go out an buy an extrenal hardware to be able to read the small cd to be able to load it onto my laptop- more $$$ not happy."
5,nice toy,It's nice once you get it loaded. The software doesn't allow you to copy more than one pic at a time. That's a bit tedious.
1,Dissapointed,"We ordered this product for my mother-in-law for Christmas, and were very disappointed to find that we were unable to load our photos onto the device. We called Coby technical support and were told we'd get an email about how to fix the problem...once we received the email it was only the same set of instructions on their website and didn't help us at all. Nothing loads up...the screen is completely blank. We are computer people so I do not think this is user-error. We will be sending this product back."
1,will not recognize device on my computer,same complaints as the other customers who have windows XP; this will not work on my computer. Customer service line was a joke.
1,missing parts in the cell housing,"good morningToday I received the phone casing bold 9780 and missing pieces, the product did not bring the buttons, I want to return the product and receive one with full pieces.thanks"
3,I love the portability!!!,I waited and drank a lot of pepsi to get this.. The technical part is that you cannot use the viewer UNLESS the USB is plugged into to keychain AFTER you download the program.. That part confused me at first.. But it works great after that.. even used it on two different computers in my house... Wish there were more options like titles for pics.. But overall I love my keychain. I also wish we had a choice on the other colors. Silver is a bit boring.. but the delivery time was excellent.. Got it in 3 days!!! All in all .. I love it..!!!Truddy in Texasd
4,Overall very nice item - great gift idea!,"My only complaint was that it took a little trying to get it started with the software and uploading photos. But after that, very easy. Nice product, would definitely buy again!"
5,Have order 4 of these viewer key chain,It is all the rage around my house as soon as I think I get one for me. One of the family members get it. They all are happy with the gift I gave them. Great Product and looking to get more to give to other family members
3,"Nice toy, but cheaply made","I received this product last week. Quite a speedy delivery I might add, but that's beside the point. A few nights ago, I was looking through the pictures when I accidentally dropped it from my computer chair, a height of about a foot and a half. Now the button to go forward doesn't work, the plastic piece on the inside that registers the button push to the circuit board broke, and now I'm stuck with just the one directional button.Nice picture quality and the software is easy to use, but these things are cheaply made. Guess I shouldn't really expect much from a promotional thing like this."
4,A Happy User of the Coby Keychain Viewer,The Coby keychain viewer has created quite a stir among our friends. It's a great way to carry your favorite photos of our grandson and his family.We actually ordered several others for gifts as the price at Amazon was much better than any other site we found.
1,Not worth the trouble,We could not get the product to work consistently. It took several attempts to get it installed and then it stopped working.
1,Not worth your time,"This product is not even worth your time I order 2 one for my wife and one for a friend. Neither would work I got one of them to connect 1 time and that was it. They are a waste of shipping, my time and theirs."
5,Well Worth the Points,"I got this product and was so pleased with it, I got another one for my daughter-in-law. I love the quality of the pictures and now can show off my granddaughter where ever I go! Thanks Pepsi!"
1,Horrible,there is a black line going through the pictures and it won't go away. i have emailed coby and still have not recieved a responce
5,photo keychain,Bought this for the grandmas for christmas. They love it and love having pictures to show of their babies at their fingertips. Easy for them to use...
1,Did not work,I got this key chain as a gift. I tried to load pictures onto it from a computer running Windows XP and a computer running Windows 7. It did not work with either one so I returned it.
1,I don't get it,I read the instructions. Hooked everything up but can't get it to work with Vista. It really can't be that difficult can it?
1,Wish I could get past the set up!,"I received this today, and for the past 3 hours my husband and I have been sitting at the computer trying to connect the device. I tried unplugging the usb several times, and did finally get it to connect, only to get a ""download failed"" message. What fun! We're also getting messages to Format the Drive, but that doesn't work either.Called Coby Support, because of course their manual says they're open until 11pm EST, it's 9pm, and they are closed.Wish I could get it to download some pics so I could actually use it as intended, but will probably return to amazon tomorrow."
1,piece of junk,I read the mixed reviews. I ultimentaly decieded to try the product. The software would only let my download a few pictures at a time and then when I went to download more pictures in to the keychain it would earse the ones already on it. I returned it.
1,It doesn't work...,"It would not work on my Vista or XP computers,they would not even recognize it. The software is NO GOOD, I went to the coby website to re download the software...NO HELP! I guess it's an item before its time....I'm returning it."
4,thumbs up,"I thought it would be drag and drop file transfer, but that doesn't work at all. After I installed and used the included software, there weren't any problems. The USB cord seems a bit loose. I used the cord from my camera, since it was a better fit.Create a ""Coby"" folder to hold the photos to transfer. It's easier to have a edited batch in one place, than to transfer from many locations.1 install software. Critical step. Drag and drop file transfer attempts will cause formatting dead end. Device cannot be formatted.2 plug in usb, select USB update. Critical step, photo transfer software won't open without viewer attached.3 open photo transfer software.4 pick photos to transfer using buttons on device panel in center of frame. Simple interface, hovering over a button shows its function.5 Click ""download images"" button on right hand side of frame before exiting.6 enjoy."
5,"Works great, no problem",I cashed in my Pepsi points to get this keychain despite all the bad reviews about how it doesn't work. I have Windows XP and had no problem getting it to work. I love it and am saving points to get one for my mom and boyfriend. :)
3,Nice but tricky,"Bought 18 for a team gift. It was tricky at first but I managed through necessity. I though with 18 I could shortcut the process - NADA. Ad nauseum tedium! However, the results are outstanding! It was like having an operation - it doesn't take too long to forget the pain and frustration because the results are so good."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I purchased this product and had major problems with it. It does not work with a mac and only after several attempts did it work with windows, or so I thought. When I came back to my computer to load the pictures, it stopped working. The key chain would not pull up the options menu. It would only turn on and whenever anything was pressed it would turn off. Don't get this product, it is defective and will only make you frustrated and upset that you purchased it."
1,Don't buy this....seriously...,"I recently purchased two of these keychains to give as Christmas gifts this year. I read all the reviews and even though they aren't stellar, I decided to give it a go. Now I'm sorry I did. I have Windows XP and even with all the assistance given here in various reviews I was still unable to get the pictures loaded into the keychain. And it took FOREVER just to get the message that the software installed. This is really waaaay too much work for just a simple keychain. If I were you I would look elsewhere for a digital keychain. There's a reason this one costs under ten bucks."
1,had to send back,"I purchased two of these, but the software was not compatible with Windows XP (my operating system), even though the description says it is. I tried running it on two different computers and three different usb ports and the drive would not format. I called the manufacturer (Coby) and they said return it to Amazon."
1,Does not work with Mac,"The software that comes with this item does not work on my Mac Book Pro. It crashes when you try to update the pictures on the device. I contacted Coby with the problem, but they failed to respond. Avoid this if you are a Mac user."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS XP!!!!,"I was so excited to purchase two of these for my parents, who are going to be first time grandparents soon. While the devices themselves seem to work OK in that they show the 2 sample pics, the software DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP. I wish I had read the ""fine print"" of all the customer reviews, because this seems to be a common problem.While the 6Ave policy is to issue replacements only, I actually found a nice person in customer service (Ray) who agreed to give me a refund--I told him that I had tried both, and had read about this being an issue with others, so I didn't want replacements because it wasn't likely they'd work either.It's unfortunate because this seems to be a good product. I see that not everyone has had this problem, so just be aware. It's embarassing for gifts you give not to work so just a word to the wise.Perhaps soon Coby can get the software fixed so that it's compatible with Windows XP."
3,50% satisfied,"I read about not seeing the pictures clearly... they were right. For under $20 it's OK, though: you can have disposable fun, or give it as a gift, and that's OK. It's fun, it's original. But keep in mind: You won't get good pictures."
1,Not Compatible with OSX!,"The Amazon website said it supports OSX, so I bought it and it didn't work. I go to the Coby website and it only says that it is Windows supported. Now I have call Coby to verify and will have to probably do a return, UGH!!! -Eric"
3,"Overall, not bad","I bought this product for my Mom. I added pictures to it. It's pretty easy to work with, but I defenitly think it can use some improvement on the uploading part of the process. Some of the pictures were cut off.Overall, easy to use. No problems with software at all. She loves to show off her family!"
2,Not quite there,"I purchased the product for my Mother-in-law, hoping she could carry a pre-loaded collection of pictures with her.Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Installation of the software was difficult. Once this was resolved it was an easy task to select and upload the photos - unfortunately I discovered that the upload software ""automatically"" crops the photos, and ""what you see"" is not ""what you get"" when you select pictures. Each picture had to be manually cropped using the software.Once the photos had been selected and manually cropped, the keychain worked, although the battery did not appear to hold a charge very well, and there is no ""auto off"" feature. There is an ""Auto on/off"" feature which allows you to turn the device on at a specific time and off at a specific time. Otherwise, if you turn it on and forget to turn it off, you run out the battery.Overall, it's ok if you don't mind spending time with it to get it to work, but don't plan on getting it for someone else.I returned mine."
5,Great little viewer,"Coby DP-151 1.5"" Digital Photo KeychainI just recieved four of these and am very impressed. The software that comes with the viewer is easy to install and to use. I did have a slight problem with the software finding the viewer but I just kept trying for about four times and it found the keychain without a problem. You are giving quite a few choices as to the viewing of your pictures the built in clock etc. As for the downside. The only thing I can see is the lack of a screen cover to help keep it undamaged. But as to how easy it damages I can not say. This is a great gift and a great way to show off your photos."
1,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"Cute product-horrible instructions and tech performance, spent over one hour trying to install on Windows 2000 and computer wouldn't recognize it then error message kept coming up. Tried many different ideas and suggestions from others/message boards-nothing worked. Its packaged up and being returned tomorrow!!!"
4,positive review,"I bought these as gifts, but i opened one to put pictures on before sending out. after i got the hang of what the software wanted it went fairly smooth. I like the size. I like the picture quality. Its easy to view your pictures. over all I'm happy, I hope my family will be too."
2,prepare to spend a lot of time trying to get it to work,"Before I bought this device, I read lots of reviews saying how this device doesn't work very well, but I thought I would take the risk and so I bought one for my mom for christmas present. Guess what, the first try, it didn't work. I called Coby's tech support, and did everything that they told me to do, and it still didn't work, and the guy told me that I should return it, but its 5 days before christmas!! What do I do about my mom's present! So after all that, I sat in front of my computer for one hour plugging and unplugging the USB, installed and reinstalled the setup, and finally, my computer recognized the device. So if you buy this device, it probably will work, but be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to get it to work."
4,Great gadget!!!,"I think this is great. It is so easy to connect and download the photos. I gave it to my daughter as a gift - she is 11 and loves it. She shows all of her friends her 60 flashing photos!! I am going to give it as gifts to other people too. I think for the money ($20) it is a great little gift for someone who likes cool gadgets and/or likes pictures. It's like a miniature digital photo frame. The only cons are that the battery runs out after it is on for 4 hours, the pictures could be clearer. But neither of these things bother my daughter!"
4,coby digital keychain,Does everything it is supposed to. It can be tricky to figure out at first. I don't remember the exact wording on the buttons in the program but you have to push another button after you transfer the pictures to the device. otherwise they won't be there when you disconnect it from the computer.
1,Absolutely Worthless,"I'm not dumb when it comes to computers, but I couldn't get this to work, on either of two computers. Absolutely useless, and I returned all four I got for holiday gifts. Vexing."
2,Must Have Patience,"I bought two of these. One worked with no problems. Very easy to hook-up, load, and turn on. The other one......made me wish I hadn't bought either one. HOWEVER, after about 3 weeks of working with it, I FINALLY was able to download pictures. I believe the USB cord was bad!! Good luck if you buy this thing."
4,bpought for deploeyd parents,I bought the digital photo key chain for my daughter and her fiance so they can take photos of my Grandson with them to Iraq. They were thrilled as it holds so many photos and is small enough to carry with them all the time.The loading of photos was very easy and they show very well.
1,keychain software problems,"I bought two. On one occasion I was able to download photos to the devices. I have not succeeded again. I am unable to get the software to reliably run and I cannot figure out if it needs some unstated sequence of steps or if the keychain is just an unreliable design that in not seen by the computer's usb port every time. At any rate, they sit on my desk as testament to the fact that I am a sucker. You should not buy one of these unless you intend to lose your keys soon."
1,Don't buy this.,"The first time I plugged this in, it went into charge mode automatically. After it was charge, and I tried to load pictures on it, it would go back into charge mode, automatically. After several times of trying, it just quit working. It does not even turn on anymore. Don't waste your money."
1,Worst thing ever!,The software dvd doesn't work so practically it is useless. A complete waste of money.
3,Fair,"I just wanted to have a High resolution screen on this one... pictures look too grainy, I would rather pay a little bit more to have enough wuality to distinguish faces! and Im talking about a couple with a close-up picture..."
1,dont buy,this digital photo key chain is no good will not load software on computer for windows xp no help cant not use
1,software doesn't work...don't bother,"I had high hopes for this little gadget, but I guess you get what you pay for. it won't work without the software being properly installed and the install disc they send doesn't install things properly.pay a little more and get something that might actually work."
1,Cute but not so sturdy,"Biggest problem for me is that it comes with a tiny disc, and Mac does not accept tiny discs. So, I have to use this on my old laptop. It was a gift so my wife could carry easily accessed pictures of grandkids, but really, a cell phone is more practical."
1,OUCH! $5.95,"G'DAY MATES!There are no winners here. This is a note saying a report was written. If you need the report, this is not the place. Save your money; add a nickle; run down and buy 6 Lotto tickets."
1,"ABS plastic is not ""GI spec""!",GI spec would mean that its made of kevlar and can stop a 9mm bullet... this is plastic and will not stop anything stronger than a paintball round. The seller of this product should be kicked off of amazon for deceptive advertising and endangering the lives of any one who buys this.
1,Why GI spec?,"I often wondered why they call this a G.I Spec Helmet when it doesn't meet the ""Government Issue Specification"" for a ballistic helmet. It's for airsoft or paintball, not for real bullets. It does not have any ballistic defense value except on TV shows and reenactments. Whoever is selling this should remove the ""G.I. Spec"" from the product title."
3,"Eh, it was okay...",Psychopathia Sexualis is a pretty good book but I found myself skipping a lot of it because it got really dull.
5,Sweet Vincent D'Onofrio Movie,"I thought this was a really sweet movie and showed the funny quirky side of Vincent D'Onofrio. But then I am a big Vincent D'Onofrio fan, he is truely one of the best actors of our times."
4,Happy Accidents - Brad Anderson,I loved this movie!!! Once I saw it... I had to get it... if you believe in fate and all that fun stuff it's a good movie to watch!
2,Time travel? Really?,"I stopped watching when she started beating the crap out of him. I love Marissa Tomei, but I couldn't finish this one."
1,Awful movie,"What an awful movie. Horrible acting of the main male character combined with a degenerate plot. I walked out after giving it 30 minutes of my life, and was followed by another family member in another 5 minutes. My husband made it till the end only to find out if it was worth the suffering of watching it. He said he was amazed to find out that the ending made the movie even less intelligent to say the least."
2,Good actors---weak story line,The acting was superb but the story line was pretty weak. The movie would have been a lot better if it were a lot shorter. It seemed to go on and on and I guessed some of the surprises before they happened. Watch it if you're curious. I don't think it deserves all the rave reviews.
1,B - Movie -Don't waste your money,"This a B quality movie. Good actors in a poor quality movie. Very slow, dumb movie. I do not understand the other reviews that say good things about this movie. Don't waste your money on this."
1,A Film About Time Travel That Will Waste Your Time,"I guess I don't share the artistic sensibilities of the other reviewers that have posted their reviews. Nonetheless I give this ""little"" film two thumbs down - way down - in fact if they were any lower they would be hell. That's how far down. While the story's plot is intriguing, its execution would be considered cruel and unusual punishment for the audience. Long slow moving story about a man from the future returns to the past to save a girl's life. Painful, unfulfilling and a predictable ending. He saves her life - hopefully revealing the ending will save some of you from wasting your time watching this like I did. Now I wish someone from the future would come back and save me from watching this movie."
4,HAPPY ACIDENTS,I think Marisa Tomei is great in the film. A great supporting cast as well.Who is that guy with the snow cone?A MUST SEE !!!!!
4,My new favorite!,"Despite the fact that Marisa Tomei is a bit too hysterical - I was amazed by this movie so much! It's a total gem, and I had to get it for my collection. And I don't buys movies too often - only those I know I wold want to watch again and again - and again.A great piece, and Vincent is so great in it!"
5,"One of the BEST! Wait, it IS the BEST!","I rented this DVD just for kicks one day. The first time I watched it I was very confused of the plot, but the story is highly entertaining! It's a BRILLIANT with GREAT cast members. Throughout the entire movie you will be surprised by little twists and turns that are in no way predictable. If you like movies that are a little out of the ordinary, this is it! I LOVE this movie! I'd have to warn you, either you will love this movie or be bored out of your mind. It's different, you'll see!"
4,Happy Accidents is a real gem,"I'm a Marisa Tomei fan, so I was inclined to like this movie, but I was unprepared for its inventiveness and clever scripting. Ms. Tomei's performance was nuanced and engaging as was Vincent D'Onofrio's. This is essentially a two character play, and without their ability to make us believe in what we're seeing, the whole movie would dissolve into drivel. While that might be true of almost any movie, this one in particular has a plot that's a bit far fetched, so credibility is central to enjoying and appreciating this film.I promise you, unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool meanie, you'll just love this story and the two performances that deliver it. This is really an undiscovered gem of a movie.Highly recommended."
5,Cute romantic movie,"Ruby Weaver seems to be a classic codepoendent who can't seem to find the right man.Ruby is excessively preoccupied with the needs of others and places a lower priority on her own needs. Does she just care too much or is she simply messed up? Will she finally find happiness and love with Sam Deeds or is this relationship just like the others?This is an overall good,sweet,romantic movie and please ladies don't let the time travel stuff get in the way of enjoying this movie. I almost didn't mention it just for that reason."
5,great movie,"this movie was so interesting, it definitely kept me guessing the whole way through. It is unique as well as romantic and somewhat funny as well. I recommend!"
4,Entertaining fun,"I found this movie by accident. I figured I'd see if it was any good. I would rate it a B-. Good, but not great. I really thought the ending sucked. It just ended."
4,Sweet romance with a twist,"Vincent d'Onofrio is very cute in this and Marisa Tomei plays her usual neurotic girlfriend character. Still, it's a sweet romantic story set in cynical hard edged New York that keeps you guessing until the end. I literally held my breath in the final resolution scene. Watch with the girls."
4,fun,"Almost like a Hallmark classic to us. Great sit back together , pop the corn with a glass of wine and let the day pass with a smile or two."
3,"Eh, it was all right. Not really a comedy","Quirky, not horrible, not great. Not that funny. Romantic, i suppose. Really more of a chick flick than anything else. Would not really recommend it, but it was not a total waste of time. I guess Im not making it sound all that good, but it wasn't all that good."
4,My wife LOVES this CD,"While I greatly enjoy this CD (4 stars), my wife absolutely LOVES IT (5 stars)! I'm not particularly big on mainstream Christian music or Protestant hymns...while I DO enjoy world music. My wife loves both. SO...this CD meets both our preferences! It has some songs in English, some in their native language (Swahili...I believe), and altogether beautiful. I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because the music itself isn't necessarily top of the line...although IT IS professionally done concerning sound quality and musical talent. It just isn't the best African music I've heard. The lyrics are of course edifying. If you like World, African, or Christian music, I advise that you get this CD! It may not be on the top of your list, but you'll enjoy it a lot! :)"
5,a winner,I love this cd! Very uplifting and energizing.I've listened to it for months and send it to friends.
5,Best No-Fluff Keyboard on the Market...,I just wish they would make one of these keyboards for my laptop. The keyboard is engineered perfectly. It's really hard to find a keyboard without all the media keys on it that's not just a piece of plastic. I do lots of typing as a programmer and really like how they've engineered the different areas of the keyboard to compensate for the differences in pressure per finger most commonly used to strike the characters. Great purchase. I will buy another when this one becomes exhausted.
5,My Favorite Keyboard,"All the keys are in the right place, the slope is perfect, the keys have just the right resistance. Even better, I have two of these and I haven't managed to break one yet!"
2,"Good form factor, flawed mechanical design","The keyboard has a nice shape, and my fingers feel like they're resting in the proper positions. But the ""r"" key has developed a problem after only 1 week of usage: it sometimes doesn't register, and I have to press down harder than any other keys. Also, the left shift key doesn't depress if I push down on the right side of it. The left shift key doesn't have any problems. A dissapointing purchase."
5,Flattering light,I've always liked this brand of light bulb. The light is not harsh like so many are. I like the handy multi-pack too.
3,Decent,"Decent bulbs, I mean they are light bulbs, so they do an efficient job at lighting. Good price regardless. A+"
2,They don't last long.,"These bulbs only lasted an average of 3 weeks in low-use sockets where we have had bulbs last for 6 years. They do give a nice light, so I gave them 2 stars, but they aren't worth it if they don't last."
2,Waste of Money,Maybe I got a bad batch. But one light went out after two weeks of intermittent use. The other two are still working after four weeks but I am wondering fit its worth the cost. A bit disappointed.
4,Great bulbs,"I received these bulbs as a present... I installed them and they showed off the kitchen in a much brighter, colored manner. I love them. I also installed them in the bathroom. They're great."
1,"Great bulbs, only 3 of 4 worked","The bulbs are great. I have to give 1 star because 1 bulb out of 4 burned out the moment I turned on the lamp. Others worked fine in the same lamp, so I have to assume it was the bulb. So - you might not be getting as super a cost deal as this appears to be. Packing protection in the box was minimal for a light bulb. This may be the culprit."
4,"They are ok, but not enough to be worth switching out all the bulbs in my house.","These bulbs appear a little whiter more like a halogen bulb, or about 3000k. Looking at different colored objects under these bulbs vs standard bulbs, colors are slightly brighter looking. Otherwise I don't seem to have a color preference for lightbulbs as I don't really care about such a small difference. I do just fine with standard bulbs. I do find they are dim and needed to get 75w to use in place of 60w. I got a pack at Wallyword for $2 just figured I'd try them out. I give them 4 stars just because they are lightbulbs and they make light as I expect, and I haven't had any early failures yet."
1,Dont use on a dimmer! Horrible Buzzing/singing noise,"I would say the the light is different. Like those people who put the blue headlights in their car trying to be like an expensive car? Not sure if its better or worse, just different. I am using the 75 watt flood lamps in 6"" recessed can lights in my office. I have them on a dimmer, and have tried several very expensive dimmers in an attempt to make the horrible filament buzz go away, to no avail. I will never buy these bulbs again. They are really cheaply made, and also have a very short life."
3,"Lots of Hype, Little Difference","According to the sales propoganda, regular light bulbs are yellow-ish and casts a pall in your room. This guy has neodynium in the glass, and therefore has a slight bluish tinge. In my home, there was virtually no difference between this 'natural' bulb and a standard, cheapie light bulb. We swapped out this light bulb with a regular one several times, yet the difference in color was slight. With this bulb, my living room still has a noticeable, but less intense, yellow tinge. To be fair, though, my walls are all off-white without a lot of color. I could not accurately judge this bulb's effect on color, but I know that some make-up mirrors and dressing mirrors use this type of bulb for accurate color rendition (ordinary fluorescent lights changes the color of things)."
3,Old school Sensitivity,"Nina Simone, what to say...cannot avoid to create an atmoshere. If u don't like it, it will make an emotionel statement, different from yours, for u to mirrow in. If u like it, u can talk, live make love and create in it.Nine Simone have an old school sensitivity, that carries time and circumstances, that only belongs to the future, to a degree, we integrate it. What I am saying is, i don't think we are about to create circumstances for a new Nina Simone.Enjoy."
3,Interesting,"It is true that Lasch relied a lot on psychoanalysis in his intellectual barrage against the American culture, but his point of view is certianly worth considering. To start with, the book makes an attempt to be comprehensive which is not crime except that many of the issues he touched upon would require further elaboration within a much broader theoritical framework. He borrows extensively from Freud, criticises Fromm and squeezes Horeny in, thus sacrificing many other branches of social sciences to place psychoanalysis at the forefront. It is not a great book and one should not be lured by the big words, but it does have its interesting moments."
3,Transaction was excellent,"The book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Everything went smoothly. This book is pretty much over my head, perhaps someday I'll be able to read it and understand it better."
5,Must Reading,This is tight prose at its best. Each sentence is powerful and creative. I don't often read a book twice let alone study and then buy a book for long term ownership. Of all thousands of books read I only own a few. This book has hundred of insightful observations regarding American culture possibly from a Marxist/ Freudian perspective. Everytime you read it there is more to it. It's like reading hundreds of books all in one volume. Remember this book is critcal about less ego not more ego and it wants to promote continuity between generations and other entities.
2,"""I don't like how people are losing their sense of past in favor of the self""","There, if you read my title I saved you the time and money necessary to read this book.If your idea of a good time is reading an indictment of American Individualism repeated over and over again each chapter with a batch of other people who agree with the author cited to somehow legitimize what he's saying, then go for it.Recommended for the first year psychology and philosophy student in college. Nothing will make you feel smarter and more spiteful of all those people who beat you up in highschool and / or stood you up at the prom than this one!Also, I didn't like it."
1,Who?,not very interesting. Plot kind of borig and they seem to be interfering with the culture far too much. so
5,The Aztecs: Part One,The Aztecs: Part 1Wonderful Classic Who. I've been a Doctor Who fan for many years. My first doctor was Tom Baker. I've enjoyed being able to watch the first doctor in action. I've only seen a couple of first doctor episodes. What fun they are.
5,Combine with Connecting Cuisenaire Rods. Excellent applied math.,"I teach my first, second, and third graders with Miquon because it is an applied math approach. During or at the end of third or fourth grade we use connecting cuisenaire rods to complete the book ""Everything's Coming Up Fractions"" . They especially enjoy using their answers to figure out the riddles."
4,Glad Shy is finally back,The greatest story never told is a great ablum from start to finish. Shyhiem is one of the most underappreciated rappers in the game today. I wish the wu would put him on some more of their stuff. I reall think that if you have heard shyheim in the past or are a fan of the wu youll really enjoy this album. RZA does do some of the producion and la the dark man appears also. WU Tang Forever??? Get this wu tang clan back in the studio and make an album
3,Great weather forcast,"This WEATHER REPORT CD is the one to buy if you have never heard of the group. Yes 8:30,a live version of many of the same songs gives you a warm feeling too but it is missing the studio production impact of there big hits like BLACK MARKET , TEEN TOWN and BIRDLAND. Listen to this CD first and it will draw you to this ""somewhat before their time"" fusion rock jazz group that has changed it's musicians through the years but not the great adventerous jazz(until ending in 86'). Tony Williams played drums with the original group and if you like percussion oriented jazz try some of his own stuff.Enjoy the Weather!"
1,Weather Report's Worst,"With so much fine music to pick from, it would seem easy to make a good compilation of Weather Report material. Instead you get a mishmash of second-rate material. If you want an overview, get 8:30 instead."
4,"Dark, strange stuff","Before Johnny Dowd and the Chicago/Bloodshot guys were tearing through and tearing up the iconography of country music, there was Lee Clayton.Jet pilot turned country music singer, Clayton's straightforward, unsentimental phrasing conveys his dark, strange songs very well. He takes gospel, bluegrass and blues images and he stands them on their heads, with strong and authentic effect.These two records are an excellent introduction to a songwriter's songwriter. Buy these and you'll want more."
4,Hilarious Family Fun,"This comedy DVD has lots of great humor. There is no shortage of laughing while viewing this one.It features two comedians with whom I was already familiar (Brad Stine and Jeff Allen) and two that are new to me (Anthony Griffith and Ron Pearson). Each has a different style, but all are extremely good. This is a comedy show that one can comfortably watch with the whole family. There is no foul language or off color humor. These comics demonstrate that great comedy need not be crude.The only reason that I rated it with four stars rather than five is that there is a lot of non comedy time on this disc. It contains interviews and other commentary. Although there is nothing wrong with that, it is not quite what I was expecting. Nevertheless, it is a great time. I recommend it."
1,Apostles of ?,"This was disappointing. We got this as a gift, assuming it would be like ""Bill Cosby"" clean comedy with Christian themes. The DVD is about 1/2 interview/commentary, and 1/2 staged comedy. Except for the ending statement about the comedy being intended to encourage the (Christian) audience, the little encouragement in it came primarily from the struggles shared during the interviews. Although much of Brad Stine's material could have been funny, his fire&brimstone yelling-preacher delivery conveys his apparent ignorance. I also found Brad's (and his wife's) goal for him to be immortalized a bit vain. The team in general had mostly funny material, though where's the creativity in constantly degrading family members, church groups, or other people-groups ? Ron Pearson's material seemed the most creative, and was very well delivered. Jeff Allen and Tony Griffith also had some good material and good delivery."
4,truly funny clean comedy,"This DVD is a real gem. We watched it and laughed until we cried. Three of the comics were super funny and family appropriate. We both felt the fourth comic (he also played host) was ""harsh"". He said things young people might repeat that could be considered innappropriate - not sexual - just ""angry"", demeaning jokes. He is the only reason I did not give this 5 stars. I would have gladly given it 4 1/2 if I could. Well worth watching!"
5,Excellent Worship,"Great worship in the Dennis Jernigan fashion. There are many Christian artists who are talented and have great singing voices, but Dennis is different. Dennis is a true worshiper. In his music, you can feel the heart of someone who truly knows the Lord. True worshipers have the ability to lead you into the throne room of the Lord because they reside there so much. This is one of my favorite Dennis Jernigan CD's. The music is upbeat and a couple of his songs have a distinct Jewish tempo. Great CD."
4,Only wish for more,Nicely written; would have hoped for more pictures but this is only because I love true crime stuff and Mr. Fido anticipates my appetite correctly
4,Very Realistic,"I purchased two of these candles to place in wall mounted candle sconces that I didn't want to burn real candles on. These work perfectly. They flicker very realistically. I would have given them 5 stars, but I'm not a huge fan of the color. I expected them to be more off-white from the picture and instead they have more of a yellow-tinge. I also hadn't consindered the fact that my candle holder had a small spike that is supposed to stick up into a wax candle to hold it in place and the bottom of this candle is plastic, so I had to bend it off with pliers. Overall, though, I am quite pleased with this purchase."
3,Suction cups don't work but ...,"We've never found a metal shower caddy that doesn't end up with rust. So where are all the plastic ones? We thougtht we'd try these with suction cups but they don't stay up forever eventually crashing during the middle of the night. However, this one works great with a little creativity.We hang it with nylon rope hooked to one of those plastic over the door hooks that hangs on the edge of the shower. I had to drill a couple of extra holes in this basket (don't press hard - drills easy) so that there are essentially four ropes holding this ""hanging"" basket. The cool thing is nylon rope comes in all kinds of colors - take your pick!It works great holding shampoo, conditioner, etc and actually looks great, too (if I do say so...). Just think we will never have to worry about rust again!"
2,"Not recommended, ultimately falls and breaks","I'ved had this product in my shower for a number of months. Every few months it falls off the wall; I kind of expect that for something that is mounted by suction cups. The downside of this product is that the basket is a brittle plastic which cracks more with each fall. I think it has fallen for the third time which unfortunately is not a charm, and the basket is broken apart and no longer usable. I had 3 or 4 hotel size toiletry bottles in the basket, so I don't think that I was overloading it.If you want an inexpensive product that will not last very long, this may fit your bill. I'll be looking for more durable products in the future."
3,technical info,this review is not for the content but to inform anyone interested of an error in the product description. it states that 'sexual healing' is over 10 minutes in length. just got a copy today and it is the better part of 6 minutes....unless there are two versions out there [which i doubt]
2,"Don't have a copy, don't want the same thing,or little to nothing","I haven't ordered this copy of Kate Bush's 'Amazing' -King Of The Mountain- single, why would I?, for the art from what the other reviewers are saying about it,thats about all I can see thats new 'for me'. It looks like the same version as the album, and an old-tired 'sexual healing' track which we've all heard before. Where's the 'New' B-side/Extra tracks?, where are the cutting-edge remixes?....so it looks like if you want different artwork than the album,then buy it!,if you want the same song and more,buy the album!"
2,Skechers by Michelle K,"While the shoe looked good, it wasn't very comfortable...thought they ran a bit samll and a bit narrow. Would not purchase again.Contacted Michelle K but she never contacted me back so..."
3,be careful..,"I just purchased this item. It is definitely narrow. if you want to buy it, be sure that you get at least half size bigger. Other than, it seems fine to me."
5,very nice,"This book gives you a vivid picture of how Dan (the author) raise the Golden Eagle and how their relationship grow, also it gives you many information on Eagles. It's quite touching, too. More than that, this book disprove the myth that eagles raised by man could not fly free."
1,Does not fit 2009 GMC Sierra.,"Says it will fit GM 88 and up but my 2009 GMC Sierra has a different connector. It is not even close. Its not like it was just too big or too small, the whole connector is a different style."
2,Not A True Adapter,"Product is ok, not entirely happy with it, the micro socket is a little larger than the micro plug fitted to my antenna so is way too loose and plug falls out. Only solution is to either carefully crimp socket to plug or solder togther."
5,Good item,I'm not sure what the difference is between this item an another antenna adaptor that cost a few bucks more. But this one did the job and seemed very well made. If you going to put an aftermarket deck in your GM vehicle you'll need an adaptor for the antenna and this one is good.
1,wrong adapter,This product does not fit 2001Chevy Silverado. I had to purchase the correct adapter from the person who install my radio.
5,Just as promised for GM cars,Have purchased 2 of these kits for use with FM modulators. Products fit as promised and work fine. Best price I could find and would buy again if needed.
4,install and forget,"I needed this adapter for my 2006 Chevy Cobalt LS in order to install the FM modulator/AUX port (iPod, MP3 player, phone, etc.), which is not standard in this model. There are two adapters in the box - one is for antena input and the second one for antena output. It worked right out of the box and bridged the gap between the modulator cables and my car radio/antenna.It looks like GM decided to ignore the standard antena jack that pretty much all car manufacturers and all car HiFi equipment manufacturers use around the world. So if you are planning on making any modifications to your GM factory radio, you better check what kind of antenna port it uses and whether you need this or some other adapter kit."
5,beautiful,"I used these as my wedding announcements and reception invitations. I printed them myself, and they came out so beautifully, they look professional. Really easy to format and assemble. I'm very pleased with them - I just wish they offered the same thing in different colors/designs. I'd use them for everything!"
1,Poor at $5 I can't even say I got what I paid for,"Wouldn’t install without a ton of personal information and spyware, then wouldn’t run properly. Also every time you try to use it your forced to endure their cheesy flash add before it freezes and fails to load the program. You need not buy any product from a manufacture like this unless of course you want to waste money."
3,okay but not all it states,"I am working my way through v8.1 now - I found it very hard to load & endured a long time on the help line only to be told to look on line for help - it finally loaded but I don't know how.THe lesson plans & internet access doesn't not work , so I feel I am missing alot of the course.Yet , it does appear to offer a well structured course.If you are to buy this , look for a discounted price incase you suffer the same problems as me. I wld recommend it - not sure if I am learning Spanish but then that is prob due to me & NOT the course ! Best of luck."
3,Filmed in the 70's but still relevant today,Good family film. Great soundtrack by Flat & Scruggs (also did Bonnie & Clyde)
3,My first actress crush,I first watched this movie in my parents den back when I was fourteen. Developed the biggest crush on the lead. What ever happened to Julie Gholson?
5,Excellent movie for the entire family!,Saw this movie when it first came out. Was great then and still is. Have shown it to all my children over the years. They loved it! Great story and acting by some lesser known players. By the writer of the Waltons. Great footage of the blue ridge mountains and the mountain people.
5,Where The Lillies Bloom,I Saw this movie when it came out in the theatres in 1974. I was only eight years old but I remeber how good it was. I am going to order it to share with my kids. It is a story about mountain children in North Carolina that lose their father then do everything they possibly can do to cover up his death and stay together. The older sister is the lead in the movie and is terrific. I believe Harry Dean Stanton is in it and Jan Smithers (Bailey Quarters from WKRP in Cincinatti) is in it.The one thing that awed me the most was the beautiful photography of this film. I recommend it to anyone! It will make you feel good.
4,"A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE,EXCEPT.....","I first saw the movie back in the 70's, and recently checked it out the the library to preview for my children. It is a wonderful story about children whom ""hard work"" is no stranger. One of the very interesting things we enjoyed was the information about wildcrafting.With so many people using herbs these days, I'm surprised this movie has not had a revival.Our disappointment however was the use of profanity in the movie. It does have a G rating from the 70's. and I didn't remember movies rated G to allow cuss words back then. We did watch the movie with our children and had to FF those parts which kind of ruins it a bit for us. Except for that we love the film."
1,One big hillbilly bonanza,"Anyone who would even CONSIDER watching this movie should check into a mental institution. It is so corny; and it is just downright BAD. B-A-D. Amuse yourself with ""StarWars""."
2,Lilies,"Personally I thought that this was a horrible movie! I thought the story was good, but the acting was TERRIBLE! It was SO not believable! We did this play for our fall drama, I was Mary Call, and we were SOOO much better. The only actor(actress) who was good at all was the girl who played Mary Call. The others were just really bad! I'm sorry but I definitely don't recommend it unless you are performing it and need some morale boosters..."
5,An excellent AP English Grammar Resource Book!,This book is a great resource from Grammar. It outlines it in an easy to follow fashion. I would suggest having your own copy of it in order to take notes and study the really important areas. Other parts of the book are very helpful with writing. Please E-mail me if you know of any other great grammar books.
5,The Fine Five,The book is great: just what I was looking for. The direct text is what the overseas visitor or migrant need to be presented about this amazing country
2,French Fry Maker - Not,"I found this piece of equipment to not work as I hoped. I still had to cut the potato in half to fit into the potato chopper. Once in the chopper, it was extremely difficult to push the potato chopper through the slicer. I would not recommend this item and have sent mine back. I was actually quite disappointed because this is the only one I have found after several years of looking."
1,This thing doesn't make anything!,"The darn thing broke the first day I used it, I was told that the potato I used must of been to hard - I wan't ware I was suppose to boil them first! Don't buy this! You get what you pay for! Nothing!"
2,Dried Vegetables,"This product is probably good for one but by itself it tastes dreadful. For me, I can only use it by sprinkling some into soup."
2,"Does not come with the top punch, as pictured.","Do not buy this thinking it comes with a top punch. I was disappointed to pay a little more to get this, only to find out that the top punch was not included."
5,Entertaining,"My 2 1/2-year-old daughter really likes this book. We've read it numerous times, and she doesn't get tired of it. All of the pages are written to the song ""Shoo, Fly! Don't Bother Me."" A fly is bothering the mouse, who tries everything from telling it to go away, to hiding from it, to spraying it with water. In the end, the mouse goes to bed exhausted. The pictures are funny and cute. My 6-year-old has fun ""singing"" the words to the book."
2,LETDOWN!,"What a disappointment. Iris Johansen's past books have been so entertaining, that she has become an author whose books I purchase even before reading the cover notes. This story seems to have been merely thrown together, however, not fully developed. The dialogue is grossly bland and silly, with the storyline extremely far fetched and contrived. I found myself skimming over passages wanting it over and done with. I think Ms. J should revert to plots that are more realistic, this paranormal stuff, especially with such shallow underdeveloped characters doesn't fly. This copy of the book is definately on its way to the thrift store, it's not at all a keeper."
2,Final Target,"I was very disappointed in this book. I should have waited for the copy at the library! The character development was poor and a lot of questions remain at the end of the book. Somehow the characters didn't seem real to me. The Search, The Face of Deception, and The Ugly Duckling were MUCH better!"
1,Not my type,"There's no doubt the author attempted to imbue Melissa with strength, but it turned out sounding more like fool heartiness. I stopped reading when the book fell off into the cliche of when the brave but foolish woman charges out into danger and falls right into the bad guy's trap. Of course, the hero comes to her rescue. Also, Melissa's convenient psychic connection with Cassie means that she is quite typically saddled with a child. How respectable; please pardon my retching. My impression of Melissa was of a woman who was crazed by her emotions into reckless behavior while Travis came off sounding like the typical dark hero: cool, in control and desperatly trying to restrain a madwoman."
2,Disappointing,"I'd read many other books by Iris Johansen and enjoyed them thoroughly. This one, however, was a chore to get through. The plot was constrived and highly unbelievable and the characters were underdeveloped and boring. The only reason I finished the book was that I was hoping it would get better and it never did. Too bad!"
3,Starts off with a bang...then settles down.,"This book began with a bang and kept me interested until about the middle. From the get-go, the President's daughter Cassie witnesses a terrifying act and is silenced by fear and stubborness. Dr. Jessica is assigned to help her, as she has helped others in the past, and soon her sister Melissa and mysterious Micheal are involved. In the middle, the plot takes a turn and the reader is shocked in the way the characterization is shifted. The story unravels at times, and sometimes there is so much going on with the surface that you do not really get into the heart and meat of the novel. But it is a fast read and very entertaining. It is just not her best work to date."
2,Not Iris Johansen's best work,"I'm a fan of Iris Johansen, but feel this particular book fell short of her usual talent for story telling.The strongest and most likable character in FINAL TARGET is the hero, Michael Travis, who is a smuggler and a thief and uses other people to do the majority of his dirty work.The heroine, Melissa Riley, struck me as harsh and irrational and I found it difficult to care for her. Her past and her motto of living life to the fullest was a bit overplayed.The plot was a stretch, at best. Kidnapping the President of the United States young daughter is ridiculous.I also found the dialogue stiff and formal--not natural.However, a character that has shown up in other tales by Ms. Johansen, Galen, is, as always, charming. He is a fairly minor character, again, in this tale. And, honestly, the talents he possesses are far-fetched, but he's likable enough you won't hold that against him.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"
2,Boring boring boring,"Stopped reading it halfway. I just found the whole premise, and the author's attempt to create a dramatic context, half-baked. This struck me as a book churned out in a hurry to meet some quota. Save your money..."
4,Good Reading!,"Iris Johansen writes excellent suspense stories and the Latest on e "" The Target "" is a thriller. There is romance inher story but she keeps it second to the thriller, as in my estimation she should. She has always written top flight books and she just gets better."
2,Iris needs more time to write and edit,"I liked the two main characters but they really needed more development. Michael seemed cool but it was confusing what he did in life. I liked Melissa in the first two chapters then her character became weird. Of course there is nothing wrong with Sean Gaylen. Iris should continue savorying his character and not blow it with a quick story. I think she needs to stay away from quick writes hardbound versions and go back to what made her books really tempting and that was great character development, a suspense that was real and some heavy substance. I wouldn't recommend this book in hardbound version. It is too pricey per word."
1,So Formulaic,"I actually liked the first few books by this author that I read. But when each succeeding book is basically the same, with basically the same dialogue, it gets a little silly. There is always the brooding, dangerous, slightly illegal hero, with the strong, decent but also slightly illegal sidekick and the heroic, plucky, basically perfect female lead, who always reluctantly falls in love with the brooding hero, all the while saying ""bull"" and ""damn"" and ""hell"" (these sure seem to be her favorite dialogue words) alot. If you like repeating that formula like groundhog day, you'll love this book; otherwise a time-waster."
2,Final Target Review,"Final Target was a real let-down for me. I have been waiting for another of Iris Johansen's books since I finished The Search and I must say, this was not what I thought it would be. The characters in the story were really weak and one dimensional. Also, the plot was too unbelievable for me to enjoy. I think communication through dreams is something Kay Hooper would write (and probably with better success). I hope her next book is closer to reality, like most of her previous books."
3,Disappointed,I was really disappointed with this fourth novel in the wind dancer series. I've read almost all her books and found this one terribly disappointing.
2,A dissapointment,"I enjoy Iris Johansen because she writes suspensful, romantic books. This is one is convoluted, implausible, improbable and at times borders on the absurd. Not her best work by far - The Search and Ugly Duckling were both much better."
1,final target,this is the final book i will read by this author. I wonder who wrote this? certianly not ms Johannsen. Silly plot with no explanation as to what kind of criminal activities one of the lead characters is into other than international stuff???. Lots of silly flouncing and postureing by another main person. no real plot that could be believed.
1,Two Thumbs Down,"Final Target was the first book I've read by Iris Johansen. It will be the last.The storyline may have worked in this book, but without character development it fell flat. I put this book down when I found myself laughing at what was supposed to be a serious turn in the plot.Only two words come to mind to describe Final Target - claptrap and tripe. Save your time and money."
1,Easy to put down and never pick up!,"I have loved all Iris Johansen novels, even when she was writing more along the lines of historical romance. This book is haphazard and thrown together, totally confusing at times. I have come to expect a higher caliber of writing from Ms. Johansen, so this book was an extreme disappointment to me. I would save my money."
2,entertaining but not really that good,Blind Alley has similar themes. I found it more enjoyable than Final Target.
3,A 5 if it wasn't for the french pronounciation!!!!!,I really liked the book but the french pronounciation was disgusting!! It ruined the entire story for me.
3,"This book was good, but drug out way too long.","This is the first Iris Johansen book I have read and I was not really impressed.While the story was good it was too long and drawn out. I got bored about 1/2 of the way because it seemed that much of the action was repeated and I found the ""mind conversations"" dull and unrealistic. I had to make myself finish the book."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"As an extremely avid reader, I can usually find something good in every book I read, but this book was not one of them.The plot, characters and storyline were totally unbelievable. I never grew to care about any of the characters, although the main male character, Michael Travis, was tolerable. The female characters were just obnoxious.The telekenetic aspect was ridiculous and grew tiresome very quickly. The political aspect was just way too much -It got boring and confusing. The characters had absolutely no chemistry together and I had a hard time telling who the main character even was, Melissa or Jessica. The entire book just seriously lacked any sort of substance.I stuck it out until the very end, hoping it would get better, but no such luck. I truly hate giving such a low mark, but this one really deserves it."
2,Not up to the standard set by previous books,"This book did not meet the expectations set by having read the previous mystery/thrillers by Iris Johansen. The characters lacked depth and seemed to be thrown together. The book only skimmed the surface of the story. At first, it was difficult to tell who the main character of the story was, and the twist that occurred was a rude and disruptive way to establish the main character.The book had some great elements: The Wind Dancer, the president's daughter in a catatonic state, a submject who had experience with this kind of rescue, an enigmatic hero, a ruthless killer. These should have made a great story, but didn't.I am a die-hard fan of Iris Johansen who was very disappointed in this book. I may have to go back to read some of her previous books just to regain some joy in her wrting. Her previous books, The Ugly Duckling, And Then You Die, Faces of Deception were MUCH MUCH better than this."
2,Egh - not worth it...,"Final Target is an easy read to say the least. The story did captivate from the first few pages... but I think the author needs to purchase a thesaurus. How many times can one use the phrase ""She narrow her eyes"" on someone's face or ""She moistened her lips."" Didn't any editor pick up on this? I was getting annoyed each time I saw the same words over and over. If you pick up this book, do me a favor and keep track - I can't bare to re-read this... I didn't find that I [cared] about any of the characters - especially Jessica. She seemed a little too closed-minded for a shrink. I wanted to finish it rather quickly just to move on to something better."
1,Destined to become a great doorstop.,"I'm sorry - but this book was very, very mediocre. Not only were the characters unconvincing, but everything from the dialogue to the story settings to the plot was way overdone. I got a headache from rolling my eyes at language like ""Cassie's scream tore through the room; Michael wasn't the kind of man to show his feelings; Melissa's eyes went wide with terror"". Everytime you turn around somebody's having some sort of melodramatic episode. It wasn't long till I was checking to see how much longer the book went on. Save your time and money: read the synopsis above and be on your way."
3,"Good, but not one of her best.","""Final Target"" is a bit of a departure from Iris Johansen's other thrillers. While it is an interesting storyline, there were so many sub-plots that I often forgot about the crux of the story involving the president's daughter until the book came back around to her. The paranormal threads were intriguing albeit farfetched at times (especially at the end when the Dr. Dedrick revelation was thrown in). That said, ""Final Target"" is still an exciting story. I truly enjoyed the reappearance of Sean Galen and was pleased that he played a larger role in this story. (For those disappointed with ""The Search,"" rest assured, there is no Logan connection in this story - just a fleeting mention of Galen's former baby-sitting days.) Bottom line - while it may not be one of her best thrillers to date, ""Final Target"" is, nevertheless, worth curling up with for the afternoon."
1,Disappointed,"I just recently read Iris Johansen's The Search, and I expected a book of similar quality out of Final Target. Unfortunately, I found that this book far undershot that goal. I was interested in the beginning, partly because the story was at least somewhat intriguing. I was a bit surprised that the author altered protagonists partway into the book. That threw me off, because that sort of character development is entirely unusual. I am not sure if I am allowed to say this, but I'll try... I also did not find any reason to actually like all the main characters, and I found the villan extremely unconvincing. At one point in the book, I found myself hoping something would happen (ie, all characters get shot) so that I could stop reading it. The only reason I completed the book was because it was so short, and I am extremely obsessive about finishing books. All in All, this book is not worth buying used. I hope her next books exceed this one in quality."
1,Stinker,I've always enjoyed Iris Johansen's book until this stinker. A big waste of time and money. Silly plot and characters ugh!
2,SNORE....this is an Iris Johansen book???,I love everything Iris Johansen writes or I guess I should say loved.....everything she wrote before this one. It was all I could do to finish it. I agree with a previous reviewer that it is not up to her usual par and also very convoluted. I would recommend any other book by her but if you just have to read this buy it used or get it from the library. Hopefully her next one will be as good as her previous books.
3,Meh,This story didn't feel like a book to me. It almost felt as if it were the beginning chapter of larger book that had been filled with extra fluff simply to get it to an acceptable length to stand on its own. The writing itself was good and the characters were certainly interesting but I wasn't impressed with the plot.
5,Hope for the Devastated,"This book is incisive and speaks life into the heart of a bewildered Christian who is at a loss to grasp the ""higher ways"" of God; a prophetic perspective on suffering that may ease the pain and add grit to the soul..."
4,"Honest, intelligent, country tinged good time music.","One of the reasons I still have a record player is so that I can listen to the Lost Gonzo's ""Signs of Life"" record. They're best known for writing the theme song for Austin City Limits (London Homesick Blues). This CD contains songs from their 1st 2 records and, while, in my opionion, ""Signs of Life"" is their masterpiece, any Gonzo is good Gonzo. Songs like ""Why Don't We Write a Song"" show the honesty and insight that make this band so unique. If you like California Country like the Eagles, this is them without the big city attitude and with great musicianship. A great band in a long line of great bands to come out of Texas, and I'm from New York."
4,Good one,"When I say I like it, I guess I like the idea. It is designed for the type of playing I do. However, it is different enough that I am not sure I will get used to it, or be able to switch back and forth. I havn't had it very long and havn't had time to work with it yet to give an honest review."
4,Buy this book or I will jump out my bedroom window,"D. Harlan Wilson's world is unpredictable, unconventional and one where anything can and will happen.Many characters are the id in its purest form, acting on impulse and neurosis, which is what makes these stories so fun.His tales are weird and crazy and gory and funny, surreal and bizarre. They are complex and compelling and better yet, unlike anything you will read elsewhere."
2,Underwhelmed,"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I found myself getting tangled in his language, wanting more commas to guide me. I prefer stories with more people action, even though I am a plant nut. I didn't learn much about Rose Mary and not enough about the author. Perhaps it would have been better to read Mayordomo first."
4,I can't believe I finally have it!,"I have been a long-time fan of Karyn White since she made her chart debut in the late 80's and I was delighted when I finally managed to get my hands on this rare release. The album contains tracks from Karen's 3 solo albums, ""Karen White"", ""Ritual of Love"" and ""Make Him Do Right"".Karen White never really ""made it"". Certainly she had considerable success with her first 2 albums, but after that her success level wained. Karen has since gone into performance retirement and enjoys being a full time mother. I was disappointed by some of the non-single album cuts, which had to be used to fill this album out. I would also have liked to have had some new recordings but overall I find this collection satisfying."
2,NOT A DICTIONARY!!!,"The print out and words are good, big, easy to read. However, it's not a dictionary. It's not enough words both in English and Vietnamese!! This book helps for travelers in Viet Nam only. Disappoint!"
3,"Okay, I guess","This book is obviously for younger readers who just want to get caught up in the thrill of the ride...The storyline is lukewarm, and there is a love interest that really does not belong in a book for pre-adolescents, mainly because it's out of place. I bought this book, remembering how much I enjoyed it when I was 13 years old. I guess my reading tastes have changed after four years. If you are looking for typical Campbell, you won't go wrong with this book. If your tastes have matured, then look at the the new Pine Hollow series by Bonnie Bryant, or trying broadening your tastes to different genres."
4,I LOVE it!,"This book is really fantastic. I think Leslie is a great character and that Battlecry is great, especially as he's not just 'a perfect horse', Joanna Campbells really done well."
2,Not very good,"I think this book wasn't very detailed. One second it's April, the net it's May. No descrption what so ever. Horrible. I will give the author credit for the ending."
5,What a great book!,"This books is wonderful! It is rather sad, but it makes you want to keep reading. It's a great kids book! All of Joanna Campbell's books are great!:-)"
5,The best book that ever made me cry,If you even relately like horses then you will like this book. Its about a courages and stubborn girl who refuses to give up on a beutiful horse named battlecry. She knows somewhere in the horse is a true champion. He will be to. What she doesnt know is that she could be risking battlecrys life by entering him in a race. Will she give him a break before its to late??? I urge U to buy this book. I know U want to know what happens.
5,"Battlecry Forever, The Best Book Forever",This book is great. It is about a girl who rescues Battlecry; A a black racing stallion who evryone has given up hope on but Leslie turns him into a champion. It is very sad when Battle dies. This book is one of the best. If i could i would give it a zillion stars
4,"The ""Irony"" Of It All!","Reynolds achieved a little notoriety as a session player for Marianne Faithfull on her Island albums, most notably BROKEN ENGLISH (a song Reynolds wrote). This first solo album (originally released in 1981) shows off his talent as a superb songwriter. From ""Times Square"" (where the song's hero checks into a hotel with a ""pistol in my suitcase"") to ""Irony"", ""Bold Fenian Men"" to a great remake of Dan Hicks' ""I Scare Myself"", this neglected album blended singer-songwriter, reggae and new wave styled pop effectively and enjoyably. Big thumbs up to Edsel U.K. for FINALLY releasing it on disc!"
3,not what i thought it be..,well i was looking foward in getting this dvd and when i did. man i wished i didnt and just watched it on the internet cuz they dvd blew bad..i gave it 3 stars cuz its a somewhat of a collection to add but the dvd is bad only the first like 40min is good when talking about wrestlemania 1-3 then once wm 4 etc roll on they kill it and dont even mention some wm's either and disc 2 and 3 has matches that i already had in my wrestlemanian dvds sooo id say if u dont have wm matches then get the dvd but if u have all the wm's dont bother gettting this dvd for the good 40min only
3,"Eh, It's Ok, but nothing new and Matt Striker's commentary is painful.","Like alot of others are saying, there is just not much ""inside"" scoop on WM, which would have been great. Hearing commentary from various wrestlers and talents was the most interesting part of this, with one exception: Matt Striker. I hate to call the dude out because he is a talented guy, but you hear everyone's candid comments, then you hear Matt Striker either reading or reciting memorized comments prepared by WWE. Watch the DVD and you'll know what I mean. It is brutal. DVD is ok, though. Worth a watch."
4,A decent DVD,Gives some good information about what made the WWE great. If you don't like Hulk Hogan then don't bother...brother. It doesn't go into detail for ever Wrestlemania and does have alot of Vince Mcmahon. If you're looking for something to watch and have already see the great WWE DVD's then pick this up.
1,Disappointing. Had potential to be GREAT.,"All you really need is DISC 1 considering you can watch the DISC 2 & 3 matches on Youtube or on the net. I was very disappointed. First of all, most of the interviews were just past clips from various WWE dvds in the past. Shawn Michaels, Austin, Rock, and Hogan stuff was from a documentary for Wrestlemania 19 called ""Mania of Wrestlemania"". They did have some never-before seen stuff from Wrestlemania 9 in Vegas which was ok. Even Vince McMahon's interview was disappointing. He says the same things in every dvd...""had my father known what i was going to do with the business, he wouldn't have sold it to me"".. ""if Wrestlemania didn't work, I wouldn't be sitting here"", etc. I was really hoping for MORE. The beginning with the Rock N Wrestling connection was good..the idea of closed circuit venues, and celebrity stuff. It got boring after 30 min."
2,Just how 'true' is 'True'?,"This may be the strangest entry yet in the WWE's DVD pantheon. Does anyone out there expect the ""truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth"" from the WWE, a company that's been, eh, a little less than forthright over the years, particularly about their showcase, Wrestlemania?If Vince McMahon, owner of the company, actually does come forward and fess up to many 'Mania myths, such as the 93,000 people they claim were present for WM III, the most famous of the 26 shows (actual number:78,000); or their sleazy claim that WM VII was moved from the Coliseum in L.A. to the Sports Arena because of 'terrorist fears' (this was in early '91 during the Persian Gulf conflict part 1, and the reason it was moved was due solely to slow ticket sales)...then i'll happily apologize in print for ever doubting the George Washington of pro wrestling himself, Mr Mcmahon. Or is he the Richard Nixon? Remember, both Presidents are famous for 'not lying'."
3,good but not great,"this was a good dvd but not great. the match selection sucked. Austin and The Rock fought at 3 Wrestlemanias and not one of those matches are included in the matches that were chosen to be showcased in this dvd/bluray, Come on now.. WWE always puts the same matches on the dvd extras every time they come out with something like this. 26 Wrestlemanias (this came out b4 27) and they showcase the same matches?! come on now. WWE drop the ball with the match selections for sure."
2,Good But Could Have Been Better,I just got this DVD today and im disappointed the quality is good but it goes from HD to Regular screen and that just bothers me and i just cant watch it. I think this DVD would have been better if they really took there time with it and had everyone come in and talk about it not just take some off of other dvd's. Im just all around disappointed and i hope they do something and fix it because i was really looking forward to this DVD.
4,"""The True Story of a Masterpiece !""","This is one of the best dvd sets the WWE has ever released. This collection tells us how each WM was set up, and in my opinion the early ones up to maybe WM 20, were the best. If your an Old-School fan or just climbed aboard, it's a great dvd to not only have in your collection, but you can re-live the magic!"
3,"Good book, but a tad over-priced for what you get.","This book had a few good tips in it for portrait work. I feel though it is over-priced for what you get. It is not really a book that I would read more than once, so to me, this should just be borrowed or checked-out at the library instead."
5,Portrait Photographer's Handbook,The book is exactly what I was looking for. Great pictures! It provides a thorough explanation of important techniques.I think it is a must for serious photographers.
3,Dissapointment for me,"Well, I bought this book based on glowing reviews. I should have checked it in the local bookstore first.Cons: The book is loaded with so many soft focused images and pretentious poses as if there are no other technique. There is no life in those images. Some of images clearly overprocessed in Photoshop with oversharpened eyes and blurred faces. So, if you are into soap opera looks and poses this is certainly a book for you.Pros: On the other side the author (and his contributors) does know his trade . Lighting, composition,color etc look very professional. It is just so boring"
5,well worth it!,"A friend of mine had a copy of this book that she used as a text book approximately 30 years ago. It is filled with exactly what it says...historical drawing techniques as well as recipes and keen insight into the materials used by the great masters. This is a wonderful book for those of us who are medieval re-enactors, and who are wanting to teach and demonstrate the authentic methods to a modern audience."
4,light and sturdy enough,"This would be a 5 star if you take it to school, lesson, etc often. It is light and sturdy enough. If you keep one ay home all the time, you may want to go to slightly heavier/sturdier ones."
3,"Not exactly as pictured, but functional","I prefer footstools with the straight bar, as in the picture, rather than the ones with the feet coming out at a diagonal. Unfortunately, while this was pictured as one the way I like, what came was instead one with the diagonal feet. So, I'm writing this review with a little disappointment.Otherwise, this is functional. It is not as nice as the premium ones, has only 3 levels of adjustment, but it is a good price. It came with a carry bag thing as well. Overall, a totally generic footstool that works as well as most, but not as well as the very best. Good value."
1,Was not happy with this product,I thought the shower curtain liner was to thin. The magnetics fell out of the curtain the first day. The glue did not hold the magnetics in place. I quess you get what you pay for.
4,Nifty mixer,"I cook a lot and was looking for a faster, less teary way to chop my onions. I did not want to spend a lot of money. The Mixer Plus's handle is a bit wobbly (of course, I'm not the handiest person around and I was the one who assembled it). But a few turns of the mechanical crank and the machine does pulverize my onions. The fact that I can use Mixer Plus as a blender is a bonus, and it's very easy to clean. It may not the very best machine I've ever cooked with, but it is an excellent value for the price."
1,Disappoinment,Was very disappointed when the product was not available & my money was refunded.I really wanted this item for Christmas.
3,He's not his brother,"OK this probably would have never been recorded if Mike had not been Paul Mccartney's brother but...this album is not too too bad. Problem is that some of the songs sound unpolished and incomplete...going nowhere musically and thematically. Pauls brother has a soft melodic voice - nothing spectacular and he tries too hard to play wordgames . Woman harkens to Paul's Let It Be but its limitations are soon apparent - I mean, what is the song about? Best songs are Wishin' a thumping rocker and Tiger which sounds like something off John Lennon's Imagine album.. But Mike's voice lacks too much emotion and depth to give his attempts at wit any substance or meaning. Still, as the liner notes say, this is better than what Paul was recording at the same time -- ""Mary Had a Litle Lamb."""
1,Black Digital Chess Clock,"This timer is of no value to anyone who wants to keep track of time for more than 0.0 seconds. It is not durable, there is a rattle. All the buttons work on it except the Up and Down buttons. It will funtion as a timer but as you can't change the time so it goes off the instent you bush the blunger. I can't believe I spent money on this"
2,"Works, but there are better options","We purchased 4 of these for our high school chess club a few years back. While they were relatively easy to work and were functional, they feel flimsy and cheaply built. The neighboring middle school chess club bought some and they did not last the full school year. We have found another brand to be much more satisfactory at a lower price."
3,"It's honest. Worth the US$ 5,00","For me sounded super obvious (maybe because I already knew them), but worth the US$ 5,00. Shows the 308 as a good car when it is a sentimental toy. Just ready other sources if you are thinking about it."
1,ooh....no....,"The only song that sounds FAIRLY good is ""Wild mountain thyme"" (and thats still just a cover). The byrds are great - when they do folk rock. Here they obviously tried to be ""different"" and ""original"" and whatsever. Most of the songs got no melody, they are just failed hippie experiments. And just listen to ""Captain soul""! Sounds like children in elementary school that just have learned taking blues chords. Im so embarrased I own this record!"
4,Fifth Dimension Review,"Though this album doesn't come across as a coherent work of art like Sgt. Peppers, it has several really good songs that take you back to the beginnings of that same era. ""Eight Miles High,"" which they say was inspired by John Coltrane, was fairly revolutionary for a pop song back then. Wild Mountain Thyme, by contrast, is a traditional folk song. But they do a very nice rendition which includes ethereal harmonies. There's also an interesting, song with searching ""trippy"" lyrics written by David Crosby: ""What's Happening."" Finally, there's a haunting anti-war song: ""I Come and Stand at Every Door"" that was adapted from a Japanese poem about Hiroshima. The Byrds were apparently still trying to figure out their identity back then: folk, psychedelic, rock, or protest. What's evident is that they could be pretty good at all these things."
4,Not the Best of the Byrds...but,"I personally feel that the Byrds represent the best of the 60's and certainly are the most important American band from that era. I am a huge fan of the early Byrds, so I cannot give any pre ""Rodeo"" Byrds work less than a four star. I do agree with an earlier review that stated that this is not their best. I personally feel that ""Younger Than Yesterday"", ""Tamborine Man"", and ""Notorious"" are their supreame creations. However, any CD with ""Eight Miles High"" on it is worth having. If you are a novice Byrds fan, go for the boxed set but you could not possibly be disappointed in this one."
2,"No results, but will still keep trying.","I've been using this for about five months. I know it's doing something because my skin burns some and peels some, but I really haven't seen any positive results. I've researched retinol/Vitamin A and know it is supposed to help. This brand was the most affordable. I am 45 with wrinkles around my eyes and much sagging. I see no improvement. Frustrated. Will still keep trying and do what the other reviewer recommended: adding Obagi 20% Vit C serum to my regiment."
2,No results,There was nothing objectionable about this product but I certainly didn't see any changes in my skin's quality either. Expensive product for such poor results.
5,Love It!,"I like this author, so I just put this book on my son's wish list for the heck of it. His aunt got it for him for Christmas and we love it. I just made up my own tune to the song and my son just giggles when I sing it. It has silly words, but a good message. I love singing it to my son and he laughs at me as I whisper the beginning and progressively get louder. Great book!"
5,Will create fond storytime memories,My husband picked this book out for our little one when she was 10 months old. She wasn't too interested so on the shelf it sat until she turned 12 months. It is now a fundamental part of our bedtime ritual. She even gears herself up for the end of the song by puckering up! I look forward to reading more of Boynton's books!
5,Amazing book,"Book is fun for all ages, though ostensibly for tiny ones. Make up your own bouncy rhythm and enjoy! My littlest grandson loves to be danced around while this is being sung or chanted to him."
5,Sandra Boynton Books,"These are the best books for children. They are board books so they are very sturdy. The illustrations are awesome and I know my grandson just loves to look at these books. I have bought them for gifts also, and they are well appreciated."
3,I can't say anything special about this book,"I love to sing to my daughter and she loves when I do, so I thought this book would be perfect. It had great reviews, but the content isn't anything special. I find most of Sandra Boynton's books to be lacking anything special. I should have known not to expect anything great given the author."
1,Just weak,"Okay, so I love But Not the Hippopotamus... it's clever, fun and readable multiple times. I'm sure other books by Ms. Boynton are as well, although I don't own many of them to read to my 9 month-old daughter. And I love singing and dancing and being no-limits goofy with my daughter. But this book is terrible. Lyrics to a children's song should still have the same basic qualities of other songs - they should make sense when said, not just sang, and they should further a story or an idea in some way. This song has neither quality. Seriously considering just removing it from the tiny person's library."
5,Good Book For Kids,this book was a birthday gift for my best friends soon-to-be one year old daughter and i know as she gets to be older (until she reaches certain age) she'll look at this book and smile
5,Absolute Favorite Book!,"This is the first Sandra Boynton book we had ever purchased. We didn't listen to the record beforehand, so we sing it to our own melody, a bit more upbeat with a nice long, loud howl! This is a simply wonderful little book and the sentiment is right on the money. I agree that this is a nice little valentine from you to your kids, whether you're Mom, Dad, Aunt, Uncle, or third cousin twice removed.I can't recommend Sandra Boynton books enough. All of them we have read so far are sweet, clever and fun. Whichever one you choose, you can't go wrong. But, ""Snuggle Puppy"" is still our favorite.(I wanted just to tell you, and it didn't take long, that you should add this to your baby's collection. You and yours will love it too!)"
5,A must-have!,"Our whole family adores this book. It's infectious; for one little book it packs a whallop. The book is a love song, and we sing it as a bluegrass song. One reading keeps us smiling for a whole day. Until I find a new favorite, this is the book I will buy (along with Blue Hat, Green Hat) for all of the new babies I know. Everything about it is especially fine."
5,OOOOoooooh! Everything about it is especially fine,Guaranteed to make my 2 year old son giggle and smile every time I read it. One of his favorites for the past several months since he first picked it off the shelf for us to read it to him. now he brings it to us often.Get it for your little snuggle puppy!
4,A Super-Cute Ditty!,"This is one of my 17-month-old daughter's favourites. It is short but sweet, and the rhythm and words are so catchy they get ""stuck"" in my head for hours at a time after I've read it to her!It lets the reader become as animated as they wish when reading. You can just read it normally if you want, but it's more fun to do it up: ""OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO snuggle puppy of MINE!!!!"""
5,Excellent Book,"Our whole family loves this book - my 3 year old sings the song to her 1 year old sister. The book is short, and very sweet."
2,Grumpy Morning Dad Review,"Sandra Boynton writes songs like someone who has never heard a song before. The pictures are adorable, sure. But here's the thing--I don't just want adorable pictures. Are there a lot of toddler books that *aren't* cute? If you're going to write a book about the way you feel about your kid and put it in the form of a song, by God that song had better be cute as well. I challenge anyone to sing the song in this book *AS WRITTEN, without changing the words. It can't be done unless you're some kind of beat poet or Yoko Ono or something."
5,fun book,"She writes great kids books and this one is no different. This book is mostly a song, and the funny thing is how my wife and I sing it completely differently, but my daughter still loves it. It is very sturdy construction, so no bending, tearing, etc."
5,Baby Favorite!,"We have read this book every night before bed for our little guy since he was about 3 months old. He LOVES this book and it is a cute, sweet little bedtime 'story' about loving everything about your little one no matter what. LOVE IT! :)"
3,F Knights,"I was expecting a Waldo-type book rather than a trivia book, but my grandson and his friends are enjoying the information."
1,Don`t bother with Flu Birds!,"I`m all for b rated and dumb movies,but Flu Birds is lame!You will be very upset if you get this.Not at all what I expected.JUST PLAIN DUMB AND A WASTE OF TIME,sorry to say."
2,Like a car wreck,"you just have to look.The cover is misleading...I thought this film might be along the line of Alfred Hitchcock'sThe Birds (Collector's Edition)but I was wrong! Instead the bird's look like mutant rubber rabid chickens. The film is really a bad b-movie with alot of hopeful young actors trying to get acting jobs on their resume.If you are looking for trash you really don't have to think about or really like, then this is trash you should pick up."
3,"having actually seen it, not so stoked","Not a bad idea for a film but has weak acting by the crew of 20-somethings that try to pass for under-18 reform school kids. The guys playing rednecks in the prologue were pretty convincing and the poor impulse control and nutty exaggerations by the ""delinquents"" seemed somewhat appropriate but used more generally to move the story forward. The digital and injury effects were generally pretty good though some wounds were obviously laced with spaghetti. The story has some decent disease-containment scenes showing how different people might react to a SARS-type of situation but some of the storytelling was generally choppy between plotlines."
2,maybe hot for a yankee....,"First I will say I LOVE the Nesco jerky seasonings...just not this one! I didn't find this hot and spicy at all. The flavor was all off for me. I didn't like it one bit. I dehydrated two different flavors at the same time and for some reasons these came dry as the desert! The beef was the same fat content and everything. The only thing that was different was the seasonings. I used the original flavor for the other half of the batch, and they came out perfect! Again this is just my opinion but there was no heat in this flavoring for me."
4,Um ... huh?,Love this seasoning kit. Too bad I ordered two spicy and received one spicy and one teriyaki. Really? REALLY? :(
4,Got a little kick to it,"If you like spicey jerky then this will fit the bill. I was actually surprised how spicey it was, a few pieces that I made were almost to spicey for me. Overall though I really enjoy the jerky made from these packs, and most of my friends like them too."
3,Not as spicy as I like.,Normally make my own marinade and use sliced sirloin. The dry powder I normally use with ground sirloin. This just wasn't spicy enough.
5,YUMMY,"I found this product through my oldest brother and now I am addicted, I love this spice kit and if you follow directions it is perfect every time."
5,Good Tea,Really enjoy this product..have had two orders (480 total bags) and have been enjoying same..will be ordering another shipment in about 60 days..is the only tea that the wife will drink (is she spoiled?)..hope you continue to have it available..James L Hughes
2,Pre Review - This May Be The Wrost Shipping,"I ordered this product on May 3, 2010 and figured that like all products I order it would be here within a week. Yesterday I received an email telling me that the product will not be shipped until May 17 and will not be at my door until May 24. And yet it's taken them over a week to even inform me of this. Bad business practice if you ask me.First, I LOVE this tea. Best green tea you can buy. I have nothing but rave reviews about the tea. Sadly, due to the name and people thinking it's a 'Mexican' brand of tea it was not a big seller in area stores and everyone stopped carrying it. I have had to find a place online to order. Well, I can say that the next time I have to order I will be finding someone else to get it through.I'm very disappointed in the shipping. :("
3,This CD is the bomb and I highly recomend it to others.,"This CD is very good. The songs are perfect for all the grungies out there and if you are looking for the perfect gift for any occasion, this is it. This only applies to young people who haven a real sense of musical taste."
1,THIS IS NOT THE KURT COBAIN NIRVANA,"my cousin recently bought me this for a birthday present and he didnt realise that it was not the nirvana that can actually play good music! the cover of lithium was really bad also!!!!!!!! to everyone that is meaning to look up that nirvana, this isnt it!!!!!!"
1,yuck,"This is bad. Really bad. If you like the Seattle Nirvana, don't buy this. I listened to a few tracks on here thru Real audio, and the ""lithium"" cover is a joke. Its like sub-muzak. The other stuff is even more tuneless. I would hope they were better in the 60s. But who knows. This is a slight on the good Nirvana.I'm sure they're nice folks over there in england, but uh, don't quit your day job."
1,To A music fan from ontario,I would like to state that Nirvana from seattle did not cover lithium. Kurt Cobain wrote that song this UK band covered it.
3,Where's Claypton,"Hardly any Claypton on this CD, disappointed. If your new to Cale, good CD but I am already a fan and he repeated too many of previously recorded cuts so for me it was a waste of money...as I said if your a new fan, it is good..."
1,I believe that their ride to Escondido is in an old Cadillac traveling at 20mph in the fast lane with their blinker on,"After years of honoring each other's work, most notably Clapton covering Cale's ""After Midnight"" and ""Cocaine,"" the two blues guitar greats team up to create a fresh album together. The result is true to both legends' blues roots, but unfortunately lacks any energy or punch to make any of the songs interesting. I don't know if it's because they're getting on in years or they forgot how to kick it up a notch, but somehow I believe that their ride to Escondido is in an old Cadillac traveling at 20mph in the fast lane with their blinker on."
1,Excellent Elevator Music,"It must be tough to be Eric Clapton, I am serious. At the height of his profession, Clapton is not afforded the opportunity to stumble. When I have seen him live he has ripped the guts out of his guitar and spilled them on the stage. He's the best.And, this album is not worthy of him. If this were an EAGLES album I would give it 3 stars, maybe 4. But this album is Clapton snoozing in the back of the tour bus. PASS on this, my friends."
4,Great CD,This CD is just fun. JJ Cale and Eric Clapton just seem to belong together! The music is great and the variety is most appealing. I highly recommend adding this to your collection today!
4,easy going but not challenging,"I have been following Eric Clapton since the early Cream in the mid sixties. I have discovered JJ Cale in the late sixties. Folk, blues and rock and roll are part of my background. I would expect this album to surprise me. It didn't! Though it really is very good music, very good sound... Great, but what's next? It doesn't really matter, as long as it is really good music!"
4,FIRST TIME SHARING AN ALBUM; HOPEFULLY NOT THE LAST!,"This is J.J. at his usual manner; slow and laidback.I really felt good listening to this one, but I must admit that Clapton'scontributions made me somewhat drowsy(songs&vocals;). This was my opinion after my first listening. Second time around,however, my ears were picking up Clapton's superb guitarwork. Here he proves that he's definetely his own master when it comes to provide the listener with delightfull & skillful guitar work."
4,Excellent collaboration,"This mix works right: not a bunch of celebrity duets, but a real album-long collaboration with a distinctive sound. The sound reminds me a little of Ry Cooder, a dash of folk-country with some blues and rock. Not a lot of blazing guitar solos, but nice, tasty guitar and vocals and consistently good sound throughout. One of Clapton's better works."
3,"warm, pleasant, familiar.","A nice sounding, laid-back groove by these two fine guitarists will please a lot of listeners looking for a mellow buzz. J.J. Cale's wonderful, hypnotic weirdness peeks through in ""Heads in Georgia,"" and there are plenty of tasteful, polished guitar leads over mid-tempo shuffles. As comfortable as a lite beer and a hammock, and about as stimulating."
2,Eric and JJ disappoint,I've enjoyed the guitar playing of both Clapton and Cale for many years and immediately ordered thier new joint cd when I first saw it advertised.It was not what I expected and was disappointed at the laid back style of the entire cd. No hard rock feel to it at all. No songs that stand out or have a chance at immortality. Pretty routine effort. I think these guys are way past their prime.
2,Very disappointing,"I am a big fan of both JJ Cale and Eric Clapton. I really like the laid back songs - a nice departure for both, very pleasing (which is why I gave it two stars instead of no stars) however, the production quality leaves a LOT to be desired. The sound is just not up to par. This is a studio CD folks, not unplugged live, and there simply is no excuse for the clear lack of quality. Fire the engineer, use another studio next time. They killed what could have been an otherwise enjoyable CD."
2,Boring,I am a big EC fan because I play blues but this album was boring to me. Too many slow wishy washy songs. They all sounded like fillers. Sorry EC
5,Bought as a Gift for Eric Clapton Fan,They really enjoyed getting this as a gift and said that they do really enjoy listening to it! If you enhoy Eric Clapton you will enjoy this one! What are you waiting for?!
5,Flawless Album,"This is a flawless album from the production, arrangements, and musicianship and song selection. Cale and Clapton work seamless together. I cannot recommend this album higher."
2,Road to Escondido,"I'm new to J.J. Cale and I really dig Clapton. The songs are great, bluesy, down home and the music is what I like to play. Very happy with it."
1,Road to nowhere!,"I was ezpecting a whole lot more than 3 chord, tired trite tunes. I love Clapton, but it seems he was doing some sort of favor to J.J. Cale to play his boring compositions. In my humble opinion; Clapton playing the blues is inspiring; this CD is a waste of time.Rufus"
4,I wonder why?,They're advertising this on radio Station 93.1 JACK FM in Los Angeles as being an Eric Clapton release when it clearly says that it's by J.J. Cale ex-Velvet Underground.But JACK FM 93.1 in LA sucks anyway.
2,What a disappointment,"I've been a great fan of J.J. for some 25 years and possess some 15 of his albums. Also I am a great appreciator of Clapton as a guitarist but not necessarily his albums. The best way to sum this one up is to say that Clapton brings J.J. down to a level of blandness I never expected. After J.J.'s recent Albums, ""J.J.Cale Live"" and ""To Tulsa and Back"" (Both 5 Star Albums), this was a real disappointment."
3,Same ole road.,"Very disappointing as I expected new, fresh music but got an entire CD of sameness. Vocals are a muddy duet. The instrumentals are good but for some reason there is an organ/electric piano that becomes very irritating about half way thru listening. Can't figure out why it was felt to be necessary. Sort of like listening to a group in a lounge, who thinks they can write music."
4,"interesting, better than expected....","better than I thought,..just saw Clapton in Birmingham and wanted to check out his latest,...was pleasantly surprised by his pairing with JJ Cale and his band, as well as some of Clapton's band-mates....did not know much about JJ Cale other than source of some of Eric's earlier songs, but found I like JJ's writing style...overall I liked it and I am glad I bought it....."
3,"Eric ""Zamphere"" Clapton and his famous panflute","""Kyle realizes they were so wrapped up in trying to protect their music they forgot to just play. Real artists play for the love of music, not the money. Moop ends their strike; the other artists that joined them confess that they are only in it for the money."" _South_Park_ -Christian Rock Hard-Yep, I buy new music and that pretty much sums up my experiance. What happened to albums like 24 Nights, or Crossroads? The raw blues, hard guitar solos that scream and cry. I listened to this while on a road trip and it only aided in making me sleepy. I switched back to Sirius to listen to the ""Crooners"" Dean Martin etc. If this album grows on me I will be back to change this rating, but I doubt it."
2,disappointed,"As much as I like J.J. Cale and, of course Eric Clapton as well as the players on the session...the CD just didn't swing...no part of it. Audibly it was all good. It was just bland."
3,phoned in,"this is like a lot of projects where big names team up - the sum is equal to less than its parts. Cale is usually much better than he is on this cd; on most of the tunes it's almost like they phoned it in. Clapton is too mellow. I agree with the reviewer who longs for the screaming guitars, like crosswords (which I read somewhere Clapton hates). On most of the songs, I can't tell which one of them is singing. It's like they both took valium or just weren't feeling an energy that day. some of the songs sound like warmed over Leon Russell, e.g., when this war is over, it will be a better day, with a piano and jump beat. get cale's anthology, or his last one, back to Tulsa I thik is the name, for the real JJ Cale. or get Lightnin' Hopkins for the real deal."
4,A great book for Christian Hischoolers and their parents,"This book is a good prelude for any applications to attend a university for Christian kids. It defines a ""spiritual GPS"" to use in evaluating the prospects of a specific student to do well spiritually in a any specific type of university."
4,GREAT,"This is book is amazing. It is very clear. It encourages students to pay attention to the things they are exposed to. It also teaches that even though in college you will be taught things that are against your faith, you can still learn them but hold on to your own personal truth."
2,"Beware of books (or movies) with the word ""Club"" in the title.","If you loved that Cassavettes movie Husbands, you may like this book though. In fact, I bet Michaels was a big fan of Cassavettes and that movie in particular. I thought that there was some good writing in this book, but it was too self-indulgent and kind of childish in attitude. I much preferred his earlier novel Sylvia. But I can see how The Men's Club was a huge influence on lots of macho writers who came later."
4,back to front,I am glad that I have this bookI will use it in the new year when I start quilting again
4,Great book for Elementary & Middle school age children,"I ordered this book for a National History Day project for my 7th grader and was very pleased. It has lots of pictures and explains the complex subject of Segration, Labor Unions and Civil Rights in easy to read print and wording. A Phillip Randolph was unsung hero of the civil rights movement and this book portrays his life's accomplishments very well."
3,Don't sleep,"Rapper Big Pooh delivered a decent solo debut, however I think he's better served rapping with his Little Brother bretheren. Those members do show up on ""Every Block"" and 9th Wonder produces a few tracks. However, the producer that really amazes me is his protoge, Khrysis, especially on ""Live Life"" and ""Now"". The latter song features Murs who shines so bright that it's hard to see anything else. But Pooh shines himself on ""Heart of the City"", ""The Jungle"" and ""The Fever""."
3,A solid effort,"As hip hop's next big thing, Little Brother (MC's Phonte and Big Pooh, DJ/producer 9th Wonder) have somehow found time for solo projects while making their first major label release. Phonte collaborated with Dutch producer Nicolay on the fantastic Foreign Exchange album, while 9th Wonder has racked up production credits with Jay-Z, Jean Grae, and others. Now Rapper Big Pooh has stepped up with his own solo album, full of shiny but soulful production; the spirit of Ice Cube's ""It Was a Good Day"" looms large here. Hooks are scarce, and Big Pooh's flow is relaxed throughout, so sometimes the songs blend into each other. Overall, though, this is a solid effort."
3,"Beautiful, but not deep.","I'm still searching for the perfect lighting design text. This book is close. It is small, compact, clear, and above all gorgeously illustrated with full color photos and drawings packing every page. It does lack a bit in hard facts. It serves as a wonderful introduction to the art of stage lighting, but probably wont be much help for designers or technicians of even intermediate experience. But it sure is great to look at."
3,worst of their records -but has a few gems,"this is easily the worst of the 6 albums love released from 1966 to this one in late 1970. there are a few gems- the everlasting first in particular.this brief (29 minutes) album isn't anywhere as good as four sail ( probably their most underrated album in my opinion) and out here, never mind the 3 classics they put out earlier.its very disjointed and lacks the first rate songwriting that arthur lee was so capable of in earlier works. this is not a bad album: just bad by love's standards."
1,False Start / True End,"I thing reviewers were wrong about the the ""Four Sail"" album which I really liked, so I decided to go a fewer albums deeper into the post-Forever Changes lineup. This time the critics were right, this album is incredibly bad. It reminds me of the movie Best Defense with Dudly Moore & Eddie Murphy, which Murphy did just to fulfill his contract. The songs are very flat as if he's composing on reserve fuel. It has a really generic funk/soul thing going on which sounds like Sly Stone on an off-off-off day, or the last line of filler that stands between the artist and the completely unusable material. Maybe I missed the ""gems"", but the whole album seems like filler. Also doesn't benefit from the ""Eternal Drum Solo"" (not the name of the song, but thats what I would call it)."
4,Weak - But still Stands Out,"OK, so this isn't the best Love album, but it's still a must have for Arthur Lee fans. Hendrix fans should check this out for ""The Everlasting First""(lead guitar). Stand Out has always been one of my favorite tunes although the best version of that song is on the very rare Live/Studio album. ""Keep on Shining"" is good too and ""Slick Dick"" is quite amusing."
2,Arthur Lee's friend Hendrix starts it off,The False Start title comes from the first note but they left it in as long as Hendrix was playing lead. Only good song on the CD is Hendrix playing on Everlasting first-should have included the other Hendrix tunes from the session as bonus material. Pretty boring w/o Hendrix. For Collectors only.
4,Great earphones,"The earphones I purchased are the best earphones under $100 that I know of, and I use them to make a living. I could not find them at any electronics store, but naturally I found them on the net, specifically Amazon."
2,Terrible! ...Absolutely terrible... Do not buy these!!!,"I made the mistake of buying these at Best Buy without referring to Amazon.com first. I won't do that ever again. The other reviewers are right, these are probably the most overpriced, the most uncomfortable, and the poorest sounding headphones you can buy. The only thing that is decent about these headphones is that it does an adaquate job of canceling out noise, but that's it... so I gave it 2 stars (since 1 star is the lowest rating and they're still good for canceling out noise). I returned these and bought the Sony MDR-NC6, which I absolutely love... they do a decent job of canceling out noise, they sound great, and they are very comfortable."
