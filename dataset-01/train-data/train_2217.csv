4,"It should be 4 and a half stars, but I can't really do that.",This is a really good book. It's very unpredictable.
4,THE STEPBROTHER,THE STEPBROTHER IS ABOUT A GIRL NAMED SONDRA WHO GETS HYPNOTIZED AND HAS A STRANGE VISION. LATER ON IN THE BOOK SHE GOES TO A HYPNOTIST AND FINDS OUT SHE IS REMEMBERING EVENTS FROM A PAST LIFE. IN HER PAST LIFE SONDRA LIVED AS PENNY HANSON BUT WAS MURDERED. REALLY THE ENDING DIDN'T SURPRISE ME BECAUSE I READ A LOT OF MYSTERY BOOK BUT IT WILL SURPRISE A LOT OF PEOPLE. R.L. STINE REALLY OUTDID HISSELF WITH THIS BOOK.
4,Nice shoe,"I have not had the shoes for long, but am very pleased with them. They have a nice fit, but I'm glad I ordered wide. Very functional and comfortable."
3,Classic pump,I had purchased the Doris Pump in black 8.5 N from a local department store and they fit perfectly. The mocha Doris pump I recently purchased from Amazon in same size is a bit small. Otherwise it is a beautiful shoe.
3,A little disappointed....,"Well, Actually I love the shoe it's comfortable and exactly what I wanted but for some reason it makes a little clicking sound in the left heal when I step. I can't figure out what's causing it. It's embarassing, Not sure if it's too late to send them back. I would order the same ones though, with out the click....Please, Thank you.RJS"
3,plain jane shoes,"bought these for work becuase i destroyed my go-to pair. they are not what i was looking for, however they look good and are pretty comfy."
3,TOO NARROW,I wear a medium but ordered the DORIS WHITE shoes in a size 7.5 wide because of other reviews that I have read. They are very pretty. Wish they fit me. Although marked 7.5 wide they looked and felt closer to a narrow. An extra wide probably would be a medium width but; I do not want to order these again.
2,Disappointment,"Slide off the back and not comfortable walking, although toe box fits ok. Maybe 7 would have fit better, but they are not cute enough to try again."
1,Very Dissappointed,"To all the previous reviewers, I truly do not understand how you can say these shoes are comfortable. The plastic or leather of whatever the material is made of, is extremely tough and stiff. I could not even wear them more than 5 minutes. On top of everything, these shoes run really narrow and smaller. I am always an 8.5. and in these shoes, I might be an 9.50 but I would never order them again. The shoes look cheap ( yeah, I know they are cheap ) but they look really cheap and the quality is very poor. I am returning them and will never buy this brand again."
3,Good product just not the right size for me,"I would be perfectly happy with the shoes but the size was not right and I had to return them.Otherwise the quality, delivery was all absolutely perfect."
1,Bogus,"I am completely amazed at the number of people Halliday duped with this story of totally bogus events. Even former military types, although most were not pilots, have praised this work of fiction. There is not a page in this abomination that remotely resembles any factual missions flown from NKP. The inaccurracies are so overwhelming I doubt that if Halliday was in fact a pilot or has ever been to NKP. It would take a book to list all of the implausable, impossible, and inaccurate stories in this book. While Halliday was supposedly swanning around at 12,000 feet my squadron mates and I were down at 3,000 feet over the Trail.We know what happened out there and what didn't. This book is an insult to aircrew from NKP that are still out on the Trail. They died flying real missions not some made up hoakum from an overactive imagination."
5,authentic,"Very much enjoyed this title, myself, but the acid test was when I handed it to a friend to read who had ACTUALLY BEEN to some of the places cited (at very close to the same time). His mouth locked into perpetual smile mode and every minute or so (at least during the first couple of chapters) he laughed out loud, saying, ""Yeah, it was exactly like that. We had a guy in our unit who..."""
1,"Started out ok, but....","I guess i didnt read the book in the same way as many other reviewers. To me, this book started out intriguing enough, but about halfway thru just seemed to kind of lose its own way. It went from a book of combat flying accounts and special ops intrigue and almost seemed to be trying to become a science fiction novel after the miracle emergency landing.All in all, I wasn't impressed."
5,Another Day at the Office,"OUTSTANDING!Thanks Old Friend for telling it like it was and bringing back both good and bad memories of that confusing time. Thank God for the music, 24 hour bars, and good buddies! We were young, immortal, and saw life in the here-and-now. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Baht, Singha beer, singing ""yellow liver"", and sawatdee kup! Now who could ask for more? Today we look back with fondness on a time of youthful naivet√© and wonder-DID WE REALLY DO ALL THAT? A fellow combat/transport/airline pilot, Bad Bob (one of the Travis boys)"
5,Riveting,"If you have ever flown an airplane, especially in combat, you can identify with this big time. If you are just a fan, you will not be able to put this down after the final adventure starts. Great writing."
5,"Nothing Fancy, but Works as Intended",I purchased this cable to connect my laptop to my Pioneer KURO 101FD for unlocking the ISF modes. No problems and works as expected.
5,Great Product,This is item is working perfect with SDHC Memory Card. I have tried different products but non of them worked.Thank you
3,it works!,I got this product to put files on my 8 gb micro sdhc card for my phone. All micro sd cards require a micro sd to sd adapter(not included). My older card reader doesn't read hc sd cards(high capasity sd cards). The product works and love the price.
1,owner,this card reader would not work from the first.tried it in three computers using 3 cards. the cards worked in desktop reader.waste of money
2,NOT a MicroSD Reader,"I purchased this specifically to read my MicroSD card. To my dissappointment it is NOT an adpater for MicroSD cards. Other than that, it works fine."
2,Very disappointed,"We had so looked forward to getting this puzzle, but gave up on it. The top and bottom of the puzzle were extremely hard. I think the actual poker friends might have been fun if we could have gotten to them. Would not recommend it for anyone who is not very determined and experienced."
4,Off Da Chain,"I think Mr.Biggs ""Only If U Knew""is all dat.I love this C.D. Especially #'s 3 and 13.i want to buy this C.D. but i dont seem to thinkabout it until i run out of money.I think all rap lovas should have a snippet of this song.i would love to have the lyrics to all the tracks on it.but hey ONLY IF U KNEW how good this hea C.D. isdat's all im going to say"
1,"Poorly done, poorly formatted for Kindle and generally non-helpful.",First of all this book is poorly formatted for Kindle. Most of the graphics and chord blocks are illegible and basically look like heavily redacted documents. The text itself is pretty much worthless and really is not helpful for using chord progressions for songwriting. Don't waste your money on this product.
4,If you ever wondered how to put a song together...,"Ricky Rooksby is more of a classical writer than a popular song writer. I think that background helped him in writing this how-to guide on structuring songs. Because of his extensive background in music theory, he's able to put together a guide that makes all of our songs sound better.This book won't teach you how to write a song. It wasn't designed to do that. It will, however, teach you to put together a song in a way which will be appealing to the ear. I've written songs for a long time with little success. The things I learned in this book immediately made me a better songwriter. I recommend it to anyone who is struggling to put together a song.He'll give you a step by step guide."
1,Skip it; there are better options in this price range,"Pros:* Looks good* Physical build quality is very solidCons:* Sounds terrible. I've run this sub in three different boxes (all within spec) with two different quality amps and it just doesn't respond well. No punch no matter how much juice it gets, and the real frequency range it provides is horrible.Alternatives:* Pioneer TS-SW251. I've been through a handful of shallow 10's now and it blows the others away. Don't be put off by the brand name, Pioneer did this one right."
3,Old 4:3 format,"If you can believe the writeup on this page, this is NOT wide screen in spite of being blu-ray."
5,"""Spy High""","Maurice Micklewhite (Michael Caine) has always been one of my favorite actors. I saw this 007 Era movie when it was first released and watched it again more recently. It is a FAB movie. It has lost nothing over time and can even be more appreciated today. Caine is very magnetic as the oh so sexy but slightly nerdy instrument of espionage. A great, suspenseful movie that is effective without all the 007 gimmicks."
1,Wrong region,This DVD is some EUropean region type anbd would not play on my player. I got it to play on my computer but then was informed I was exhausting my options for changing region in Windows. I should have been informed of thiis before I purchased.
4,spy story thriller,Michael Caine's Harry Palmer is insolent and effective and anti-establishment and a good cook. What a combination. It certainly works for this cold war thriller.
4,"Classic Resurfaces on DVD - Great film, subpar commentary.","Ipcress doesn't disappoint - Caine carries off a remarkable performance as the Brit agent Palmer, rescuing his lines through inspired delivery and timing. The film's camerawork and composition are a sight to behold, provided an appreciation for frequently underlit scenes. Certainly a film with a (wry?) sense of humor - case in point: the exchange of words in the supermarket. If you won't consider purchasing Ipcress, do yourself a favor and rent it some night.For those looking forward to the commentary (as I was) - the running commentary is subpar, perhaps the worst I've listened through yet. Neither of the gentlemen involved (Sidney Furie, Peter Hunt) can recall the plot sequences in the film very clearly and so spend quite a bit of time audibly guessing what will happen next. The track does reveal a few interesting tidbits, but it is unfortunate that most of these revelations find mention again and again."
5,Modelling Ships in Bottles,"Written some years ago, this book may appear dated to many, but it still remains one of the best books on the subject. Get reading, and you will find it actually crammed full of practical information about not only putting ships in bottles, but also in light bulbs!"
5,It works,"Digital cabling is one of those funny things, it works or it doesn't. Though not exactly true, precision trumped absolute speed and this cable is not being used for any rocket science or supercomputing operations, so its ability to connect one SCSI device to another was sufficient to satisfy me."
2,"I LOVE Lauridsen, but this is a let down","I really love Lauridsen's music. He has visited my choir's rehearsal in person and has explained how his pieces should be sung, and I've listened to his pre-concert lectures as well. So this review is in no way a commentary on his music, my review is strictly about my disappointment with the performers on this CD.I previewed all the tracks in this CD hoping to buy it. The solo soprano's rendering of Dirait On and O Magnum Mysterium are wobbly and scoopy. Or, to quote a popular phrase, a vibrato you can drive a truck through. I couldn't even bear to listen to the 30 second previews.Listen to the clean, pristine LAMC version of these pieces and you'll never be able to settle for this recording.I suppose the choral pieces on this disc are fine, but that's not enough reason for me to buy this CD."
4,great music - nasty voices,"Lauridsen ROCKS! He's amazing - such diverse, beautiful music that should be savoured by listeners and performers alike. Sadly though, a certain soprano voice just grated on me............his Magnum Mysterium is so gentle and sublime and angelic - and the wobbling vibrato of the soloist has made this CD very difficult for me to listen to - even as a reference point! oh dear!"
5,Multicultural Jesus,"This book reveals how another major world civilization viewed Jesus: as a prophet, teacher, ascetic, and iconoclast. It displays a new facet of Jesus, which is highly relevant to our times. I'll definitely assign this text in one of my undergraduate courses."
3,Interesting,"The references in this book are interesting but I findJesus (Peace be upon him), The Truth Revealeda more accurate account of Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) in Islamic traditions"
4,Interesting...,"This book is a collection of statements attributed to Jesus by early Muslims, some of which are reported from the Prophet Muhammad others are from later Muslims who seemingly (?) took from ""Christian"" - maybe even Gnostic - sources. The quotes are interesting and certainly show an understanding of Jesus as an ascetic. The only fault I found with this work was that the quotes are not in Arabic, and so a student of Islam cannot verify the translations easily, though the quotes are referenced to the original works they were taken from."
4,Dandelions hate this thing.,Sturdy and well made. It works great. Pull 5 or 6 dandelions after work each day and in a few weeks they'll all be gone. I am completely satisfied.
2,Snoozer,"With an older style of drawing and storytelling, TP is pretty much a snoozer. Interesting only for the diehard anime fan looking to fill in his or her catalog AND impressing his or her friends.Other than that, difficult and painful to sit thru because of the older (GI Joe quality) drawing and coloring and bland/typical plot.Good for a younger person looking for an introduction and safer due to no ""fanservice"" and language."
2,This bottle contains only a 10-day supply,"The cost/count for this product can be misleading because each capsule contains only 250 mg of HMB. Per label instructions, you need to take 4*3 = 12 caps a day to obtain the recommended 3000 mg dose, so each bottle is only a 10 day supply. Some other brands show a more expensive cost/count, but deliver 1000 mg per capsule, so you take only 3 caps per day and they're a much better value. Consider the cost per DOSE instead of cost/count."
3,Needs better item description,"Amazon needs to make certain product information available on every oral dosage form, pill capsule etc. These capsules are only 250mg, the widely accepted dose of HMB from several scientific studies is 1gram ( 1000mg, or 4 capsules) three times daily. Price comparison is worthless when the strength of the product is unknown.Hope this saves some one from buying the wrong product for them."
3,workout,"Didn't see much results, but i guess have to take it for a longer period of time...too many pills to take, 4 pills at a time to be exact."
5,I was really surprised,"Try it yourself, exercise without these and do 8 super sets with your weights. You'll be sore that day and dying the next. It happened to me. Then I tried this as recommended by my trainer and I was barely sore when I took on some new exercises. I was amazed at the difference. I use Twinlab's HMB because I've found all of their stuff to work better. Especially the Male Fuel."
1,Didn't do anything for me: don't waste your money,"This product was recommended to me to help reduce soreness. I was told you can lift more often, and get less sore. I took 4 bottles of this in a row and didn't notice any changes in my workouts. Naturally, you become less sore the more used to an exercise you are, but I don't credit this product for helping me at all. I cannot say I gained more strength or endurance or recovery than normal.Don't waste your money."
3,The liver flavor is better,"Neither of my dogs likes this flavor as much as the liver flavor. One of my dogs spits this cracker flavor out, while she will happily eat the liver crackers all day. My other dog likes these crackers, but is not crazy about them. She also likes the liver flavor better. The container is handy for keeping the treats fresh."
3,Matching flowers with phrases and words...,"Who would have thought that birdsfoot trefoil represented ""revenge,"" or that dogwood represented ""durabitily"" [sic]?This listing of names of flowers with various meanings or interpretations, I assume, is to give the receiver of flowers some indication of a message (ivy = friendship; morning glory = affectation). Or perhaps it can allow a gardener to express him/herself in the selection of plants (scarlet poppy = fantastic extravagance; spindle tree = your charms are engraven on my heart).It looks like a journal, but is meant to appear older than it is. There are a few watercolors of flowers.I would assume this slim book fills a need in a niche market. Vernal grass = poor but happy. Finis.Authored by Margaret Pickston. I have the 1991 edition."
4,"A very readable, enjoyable book - well worth its price.","It's too bad they put ""Idiot's Guide"" in the title - this book has very useful instructions for both new negotiators and veterans alike. The cover has a handy checklist of things to consider when preparing your negotiating strategy, and Ilich reinforces the importance of considering your opponent's objectives as well as your own. He introduces the term ""equalization"" and makes a good case for it (you'll have to read the book - I'm not going to give his idea away here). I would rate this book 4th on my list of negotiating reading, behind Getting Past No, Getting to Yes, and Getting Together. I've read about 15 books on the subject, so 4th is high praise."
4,negotiation resource book,"wriiten simply so that anyone could follow it advice, this book is a good read"
2,jmoesch,"Got this to help as a union negotiator. Not a good book, bottom line to negotiations is do both sides want to meet in the middle. This book does not describe that. This book assumes parties want to agree and that is not always the case."
2,"Okay, but not a real map","I bought this for a recent trip to Prague, a city you will get lost in without a detailed map. This map is a great size, but it covers such a small area of Prague in very basic terms, you end up needing another map. If you're buying either the Lonely Planet Prague or even Czech & Slovak Republics, you can easily do without this map, as both contain the same maps along with several more."
2,A Disappointing Collage,"The dust jacket for Amy Marcus' book says that this book is an investigation into how archaeology is changing our view of Scriptures and the Middle East as well. Unfortunately too much of the book is a collage of Bible stories mixed with anecdotes of modern people and events.For example, Marcus offers a paragraph of some 180words describing the office of Zahi Hawass. (BTW, his name is mispelled in the index.) In another instance, Marcus tells how Kent Weeks is changing the image of Ramses II. This story is included because if the Exodus is historical, Ramses II is probably (?) Pharaoh.Marcus also includes stories to show how archaeology is changing the Middle East. On page 90, she tells the story of Palestinians who recreate the story of Baal dying and rising back to life. Although this story is interesting in its own right, it comes across as Marcus' mind wandering again.In her view from Mount Nebo, Marcus would have done better to keep archaeology in focus."
2,A Disappointment,"I purchased this book on the advice of a good friend, whose opinions I greatly respect. I have read this book and am disappointed. The author has taken a vast subject and attempted to condense it into a few pages, which does a disservice to the subject. I found the book confusing, rambling at times, and raising more questions than answers or providing me with the direction to find answers. I also laughed when she took the trouble to describe the appearance of experts or their physical appearance, at the expense of more substance. I have come away from my reading with a little more information, but desperately in need of another book or books with significantly more, on point, substance. Perhaps more information on Palestinian archaeological history together with Israeli history would have been a better, albeit longer, read."
3,got have patience,"-Instructions don't match vehicle had to modify in order to fit or you have to remove the hole bumper on 2005 Nissan Altima 3.5 to slip the bolt and plate inside frame, (Have fun taking of that bumper)-picture don't match partsMissing= Ball mount,Hitch pin, Hair pin"
2,Don't buy it!,"Under the stress of trying to quickly prepare for the NAB, I ordered this book directly from McGraw-Hill. I did not realize that the NAB has its own preparation materials that you can order. The problem with the book is that it does not give you the specific regulations that you need to know to take the NAB. The book gives an overview of what Administrators need to know, but does not supply specifics. The sample exam questions are good, but there aren't enough. I also do not think the book is easy to follow. I am an avid reader, but had to re-read some passages several times to understand the point of the passage."
2,Buy Sum and Substance Instead,"I read the reviews for this CD series and the Sum and Substance series for evidence, after having a good experience with Sum and Substance Torts. I bought law school legends evidence and later decide to buy Sum and Substance since I wasn't getting as much out of law school legends as I would have liked. I much preferred the sum and substance one as it was better organized and easier to follow. Also, Sum and Substance has more tracks, so you can find and listen to the explanation of specific concepts again without having to search for a concept within the 1 hour tracks you'll find on the law school legends evidence series. Also, the outline that comes with law school legends evidence is too superficial to be of any help. All that said, this CD in and of itself is helpful, just not nearly as helpful for me as Sum and Substance."
5,Bar Exam Lifesaver,"I found Faust Rossi through BarBri, he gives the evidence lectures for their Bar Review classes. Honestly, I got nothing whatsoever out of my Evidence class in law school; a combination of a huge ampitheatre style room and an unengaging professor. Rossi made Evidence sensical and approachable, especially if you're from the NY area or a fan of shows like the Sopranos his stories are great. He is excellent about giving practical application for the theories he explains (Vinnie whacks Sal; can Vinnie's mom be made to testify she saw him buy the gun the night before and say 'I am going to whack that botchagaloop Sal, capiche?')If you're still in Law School and slipping behind in Evidence, or if (like me) you got through law school without actually learning anything about evidence and you're faced with the Bar, these are great CDs to add to your collection, and definitely worth the (admittedly rather high) price."
4,Good coverage of basic topics,"I would recommend this audiobook for someone interested in a basic overview of the most common topics in Evidence law. As admitted by Rossi himself, the lecture is not intended to encompass all the topics nor any one topic in great depth. However, he does a very good job in covering the basics. In short, his lectures are a good starting point as supplemental material. He seems to do particularly well in setting a scenario and discussing the practical aspects of the applicable rule.Since each CD contains only one track approx 1 hr long, finding a specific topic on the disk is very inconvenient."
4,Iris folding,"This is a small book, only 32 pages. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there aren't enough patterns. It does have instructions for beginners and examples of completed projects. It has the most elegant rose pattern which can be used in many color variations.Some reviewers have asked what papers to use for iris folding. Gift wrapping paper (new or used), origami paper, inside envelopes, tissue paper (crumple tissue for soft look) and ribbon. Our volunteer craft group has tried all these methods and you can't miss."
2,Way too simple!,"The only way you can use anything in this book is if you enlarge the designs. Some of the designs are good while others are ordinary. When I purchase something, I want what I can't get off the Internet."
1,Flashing Panda buyer beware,"I purchased several dozen of these flashing necklaces to give out on halloween and only 19 out of 60 worked. In contacting the company (Daniel) states he buys directly from China and there is no guarantees on his items. He even said at least 10% will be faulty, but 75% broken is unacceptable. I am sending them all back for a full refund + shipping cost. I will update you if this company doesn't follow through with the refund. So buyer beware, this kind of business gives the internet a bad name. Please do not support Flashingpanda.com."
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this tape because I love my other Great Body workouts; the ""Step Aerobics/Low Impact Aerobics"", ""Dynamite Legs"", and ""Upper Body Beautiful"", but I have several other Great Body tapes that are definitely not great, and this one is one of them. Forget it."
5,Could not put it down,"I bought this book while on a trip to Chicken, Alaska. Having a great love for the state was my main reason for buying it. Once I started to read it I could not put it down. The story is exciting, funny and educational plus a sweet love story. I have loaned the book out several times, only to recieve the same reaction from my friends. I would love to read more from this author!! This book is a treasure in my library!"
5,I have loved this since I was given it in 1976,"My Grandmother always gave me a book in addition to other things on my birthday, I received this book in June 1976. I being a huge reader even at age 11 read it immediately. I wrote my grandmother a long thank you note detailing the entire book. I have subsequently read the book many times over the years. The story of the struggle to survive and her kindness towards people that no one else in town really even liked, struck this 11 year olds heart and continues to strike this 44 year olds heart :). I highly recommend it to any girl who wants a real adventure story with a happy ending."
5,quality product,This paperback was in top condition. The book arrived in less than a week. Thanks for your re-cycle efforts. Keep up the good work.
5,Tisha : The Story of a Young Teacher in the Alaska Wilderness,"This is the book that started my love of reading! I was 16 when I read Tischa for the first time, from the first page I was hooked! The images and characters are so real that you feel like you are with Anne on her journey. It is not sugar coated and none of the characters apologise for who they are - no excuses are made for their choices but they learn that times change and people need to look forward. Now 17 years later thanks to Amazon I found Tisha again and I get to enjoy the journey over and over!"
5,Excellent book about life in Alaska!,"This is a delightful story about a young woman teaching in the Alaskan interior. Since I love books about life in Alaska, I found this book to be a very enjoyable read. If you loved this book, you might also enjoy a new release by author Cheryl Schuermann.When the Water Runs: Growing Up with Alaska"
5,"Thoughts on the book, ""Tisha""","I really enjoyed this book, but then...it is the sort of book that I do enjoy. It's about history...courage, prejudice, endurance...it's about a brave young teacher in a place where teaching is needed but only within certain bounds. It is a good book."
1,A highly fictionalized account,"As a researcher engaged in a project about the Fortymile and who knows the Purdy family, I can say that ""Tisha"" is a highly fictionalized account of Anne Hobbs' first year in Alaska in a town called Chicken. I found this book difficult to read, not because it is poorly written but because the story is claimed as a true one. Read it and enjoy it as an adventurous love story but don't believe it and certainly don't try to do any genealogical or geographical research based on it."
4,Fascinating take on her actual memoirs . . .,"This is a fun book to read, hard to put down. I read it when I began writing a book about the first band instructor in Dillingham in the 1950s as a sort of guide. It was a GREAT read, she had some courage to go to Chicken, AK, to teach the children. While researching my book, I went to the Alaska Room at the Loussac Library in Anchorage where I got to see Tisha's actual memoirs. Wow, was I surprised at the vitriolic anti-Alaska Native commentary (even at the beginning of the text)! Wow! Robert Specht did a great job cleaning it up for the general audience. Maybe some day her actual memoirs will be published. . . In the meantime, check out some other teacher stories (including mine:BETWEEN BREATHS: A TEACHER IN THE ALASKAN BUSH (1950s)A Schoolteacher in Old Alaska: The Story of Hannah Breece"
5,Gerald Where Are You,"If anyone knows how I can get untouch with Gerald Kingsland email at JeffKingsland@Jdam.com, urgently"
4,Who is India Arie???,"Loved the disc! Especially loved ""In My Head"" by India.Aire...who is she??? SENSATIONAL!"
2,This is my brain on meltdown,"I have an IQ of 156, and have been involved in music for over 30 years, as musician, performer, reviewer, promoter, photographer, judge, vocalist, and Karaoke. I was intrigued in the extreme by the book 's description. I have to say I was disappointed. The author is both very experienced and very educated, and knows a lot about the brain and about music. At the end of the book I find I still don't understand. Why does a foot tap to a piper or fiddler? There is no drummer, rhythm instrument, etc. Why does a minor chord make us feel wistful? I still don't know. In my opinion the book lacks wit, heart and soul. Many of the qualities we get from music itself."
2,I tought better,The book was used..a lot actually..the cover was a little bit broken and it looks like somebody did throw water on the book..also it has some black spots on the pages..but at least I could read what's written on it..
2,Talking down,"I heard this book on NPR, and the author is a good speaker. Also he played good music. His book seemed more telling us who to listen to than how to listen. Name dropping.""Music, the Brain and Ecstasy"" was much better."
3,"Not what I expected, but worthwhile nonetheless","While this book did not go into the neuropsychological detail I had hoped (I had hoped for more or less and update to Robert Jourdain's ""Music, The Brain, and Ecstacy""), it was nevertheless an enjoyable read. I was particularly intrigued by Levitin's recounting of his listening sessions with science of musical sound icon John Pearce, who observed that cognitive depth and complexity in contemporary pop and rock is apparent in its timbral constructs. If I have one complaint, it is that Levitin plays a little fast and loose with the neuropsychological research and makes some tenuous and unsubstantiable claims about music and evolutionary biology. It was as though he was searching for a tidy way to end the book and didn't really think through the last chapters as carefully as the earlier ones."
3,Heavy research oriented look at music,"OK I liked it, but it was like taking a class at the Junior College. That's not a bad thing, but don't take this book to the beach. It requires thinking and paying attention and all that stuff. I can do it. It was to good to have finished."
3,Music - brain,"Although this book was recommended I found it a little disappointing. It was interesting and the stories were fun, however he lacks the color and concrete imagery that I expected. I purchased this book for my 14 year old son who is working toward being a professional Classical musician and I don't believe he would get much out of it as there are so many references to popular music that he has never heard that he would have no reference point. I did enjoy the story about meeting Crick, but I though overall it was tough so stick with the book until the end. Overall I know there are better reads out there concerning music and our understanding of such."
3,A bit heavy on the science and music theory...,"I love music and I like science, and I have a bachelor's degree in journalism, but the technical parts of this book were too difficult for me to grasp. I am the 12th reviewer, and only the second one to have a problem with the text, so lots of Amazonians are smarter than I am. This intriguing title ended up taking me two weeks to slog through, and I did some skimming at the end. If you are a music lover who is neither musician nor scientist, do what I did: get it from the library and read the parts you can comprehend without worrying about the rest. There are lots of interesting nuggets as to why we react to music so strongly, but they need to be mined by sifting tons of neurological jargon first."
2,Should be called this is your brain on digression...,"As a musician, someone who studied psychology in college, and a fan of science this book seemed extremely interesting. Then I started reading it...Horribly boring and full of uninteresting digressions. The whole book could have been covered in less than 100 pages without the boring anecdotes. Also, a very uninteresting writing style.If you must, buy it used."
3,Interesting topic... but that's about it,"Boring... The author takes a very interesting topic and simply fails to keep it interesting. The book is highly theoretical with very little concrete fact, offering little substance for the reader."
2,A Really Boring Book,"I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately I only enjoyed maybe 2 of all the chapters in the book. Most of it is just too ""brainy"" in terms of the vocabulary that is used and the topics discussed. The chapter on expertise in music is interesting but not really back by much science. The last chapter is an interesting approach to the evolution of music and the chapter I enjoyed the most. Everything else I found very boring and hard to read. If you know a lot about the brain then you might enjoy this more."
1,please don't read this book,"As previous reviewers have stated, this book is full of inaccuracies and misinformation (for specific examples, read the other reviews). It is by no means a scientific book, but rather the half-baked musings of a pseudo-scientist and non-musician with an axe to grind. For example, Levitin writes in the final chapter: ""Contemporary 'classical' music is practiced mostly in universities; it is listened to by almost no one; it deconstructs harmony, melody, and rhythm, rendering them all but unrecognizable; it is a purely intellectual exercise, and save for the rare avant-garde ballet company, no one dances to it either"" - a sentiment that reveals not only the author's bias but his ignorance of the very field about which he is theorizing. The fact that so many people with a genuine interest in music and neuroscience have read this book and seemingly found it useful is genuinely troubling to me."
1,"any impressario, non-performer, non-musician, lacks credibility","For a musicican, for one trained as a musician, this is a heady intellectual book. However, it often misses the point - entirely, aesthetically, and in practical terms. For instance, a piece practiced a 1000 times, according to the author, should be peerless. Obviously, this is not true. The native talent of the performer is paramount, and, most of all, the piece may be practiced WRONGLY 1000 times, of which, as a non-performer, the author is clearly unaware. The author also almost completely ignores the influence and insight of professional classical performers. The author is an administrator and impressario of rock and probably rap bands. The author has no training in musicology, and probably never talked to a musicologist. I admire the intent, but there are no breakthroughs here in understanding, or enjoying music, and no great insights into music's magic."
1,"dont buy it , even if its free","I have read the bok and wish I never ordered it . He says "" I "" way to much I , I , dont know this book was ever written . All kinds of information with no value what so ever. I can save everyone money and tell you that listing to music helps the brain ."
4,Can Make You Appreciate Music Even More!!,"Being someone who listens to music very intently, I have spent my life trying to figure out why people like certain kinds or sections of music. This book did a nice job of explaining some of what's going on inside of people when they listen to music. As the author stated, some parts of how people react when listening to music may never be known, since it is too complicated a relationship for science to decipher. One of the joys of being a DJ is playing a song or part of a song and watching how people react. It's an endlessly fascinating game to guess what people will respond to. With the information from this book, I have some more tricks to try on people in the service of one thing - music and the way it makes us feel."
2,This Book Practically Put Me In a Coma,"As a nurse, musician, avid reader, and as someone who has enjoyed the writings of Oliver Sacks, I was looking forward to reading this book. For me, however, the best this writer did was to induce a quick and fairly deep slumber. Was it the over-long dissection of the definitions of tone and timber? The re-hashed discussion of optical illusions? The lack of any real human stories of interest? I'm not at all certain. I just couldn't stay awake long enough to form a decent opinion of it. So this book is going on the ""get rid of it"" pile and I hope the next owner finds something to appreciate in it."
3,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Music & Your Brain,"and I mean EVERYTHING. The title pretty much says it all.The book delves into studies done by the author and others on how the different aspects of music affect the various parts of the brain, and how the brain interprets the different qualities of music.It is fairly complicated due to music's many components - from rhythm to timbre - and musical terminology. But the good news is the reader does get enough information without getting trapped in the scientific data.This would be much better as an audio book, due to the countless references to various songs and beats."
2,More research needed,"As a musician I find this topic fascinating. The book does cover many interesting points and brings up ideas about how and why we react to music in the ways that we do. However, the authors errors in analyzing some of the music examples and forms throughout the book are flawed and drive someone like me nuts. If the author isn't an educated musician he should have spent more time with musicians researching some of the technical details of the music he examined. The book might try too hard to be all things to all people, and satisfies none. Too technical for the non-scientist, not technical enough for scientists, to musical for non-musicians, not deep enough for musicians."
2,"""A Little Knowledger is a Dangerous Thing""","Daniel J. Levitin is a hack. He is a living embodyment of the term used in the title of this review. There is no science here, only opinion and second hand knowledge that anyone with any amount of musical education already knows. He should read Debussey's essay ""The Dilettante in Music""and go re-invent himself. There is more to being an expert on any subject than being interviewed on CBC.Gordon Boothe"
3,"High on small stories, short on science","Interesting topic, and I had high expectations. Maybe that is part of the reason I was a little disappointed. The book reads well, and there are many small digressions and personal stories I really enjoyed. However, I felt I learned rather less than I expected on the real subject of the book. The best popular science books convey cutting edge science and teach you something new. Not so much of that here I am afraid."
2,A Frustrating Read,"While I appreciate Levitin's attempt (I find myself running out of books on music cognition to read these days), I was endlessly frustrated with the poor writing in the book. As a semi-professional researcher and musician, I do not have the luxury of poring over a book with vague descriptions of concepts I am highly intrigued with. It's possible that one cause for my frustration was the fact that I am much more used to reading journal articles (which are, thankfully, more succinct than Levitin's book) and have lost the ability to patiently wade through several hundred pages of fluff.At the very least, reading this book has motivated me to write my own (one day), and it's somewhat comforting to know that it would probably not be hard to surpass the writing in this one."
5,wow!,"If like me, music is one of the most important things in your life, than you will enjoy this book. Both musicians and people without musical backgrounds can enjoy this. A couple of spots where he gets a little science heavy into the cognative brain functions but not written above a lay person's perspective."
4,Music on the Brain,"This is very well-written ... the science is clear and easily grasped; the music is familiar and engaging; the lessons quickly absorbed. I heartily recommend ""This Is Your Brain on Music"" to scientists, musicians and everyone in between ... but especially to those who control the arts budgets of school districts and cities, the better to understand the damage that cuts do."
1,not worth it,"Lots of fluff and name dropping.And then this..Wagner ""has always disturbed me profoundly, and not just his music but the idea of listening to it. I feel reluctant to give into the seduction of music created by so disturbed a mind and so dangerous (or impenetrably hard) a heart as his, for I fear I may develop some of the same ugly thoughts.""Seriously?"
2,A Real Disappointment,I was really looking forward to reading this book since I am both a brain researcher and a professional musician. First it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework. Much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted. Even this was sparse at best. He attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it. However it became too watered down and even lost me. Lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments. Pushing the envelope of science should be award enough. For these reasons I can not recommend this book.
2,Revised Title: Daniel J. Levitin's Brain on Music,"There is enough self-indulgent auto-biographical dribble in this book to ruin whatever interest the reader might have had for brain science. If you want to learn about how the mind works there are many excellent popular brain science books, stay away from this book. If you want to learn about the musical tastes of Daniel J. Levitin and how important his friends are, this is the book for you. Barely tolerable."
4,Good book,"The first few chapters can be tough to follow if you are not familiar with most of the terms, but the book become more interesting as you read on. There were a lot of things that made me say ""so that's why"". I would recommend this book to anyone that had an interest in music or in the way the mind works."
2,Interesting by disapointing,"I found the book to be a very interesting wander through facts and nuroscience as it applies to music. What I missed was any great revalation. It did not give me any action plan or somthing I could apply to my music or musical education.It did reinforce the 10,000 hours to become a world class expert theory and talk about how doing the training and practice changed the brain. All good, but in the end, it did not give me anything I could apply to my life."
4,Interesting but technical,"I found the book very interesting if a trifle too technical for my taste. I learned a lot from it, but I would have preferred more examples from the sphere of classical music and fewer from that of pop, rock, etc. how can one write a book like this without mentioning FRanz SChubert even once?Still, I enjoyed the book, and also the file of sound examples that comes with the ebook, and through which I'm still working my wayDorothea SHefer- Vanson[...]"
4,revelations,This is your brain on music is a very iteresting book that I purchesed on Amazon It explains why we react to music and goes into a lenghly discussion on what it is and how it is put together
3,Music For The Brain?,Certainly well documented and written for those in the know. It tends to be somewhat boring on some occations but you have to continue on the read to hear the music!
2,A lackluster view of neuroscience and music,"Doing an undergrad and master's work in music performance and studying neuroscience as an interest at my alma mater, I came to this book with high hopes that were not fulfilled. Beginning with a jargon filled musical dictionary-like approach, Levitin takes the reader on a crash course through music and the brain. Pitch is nebulously described as a figment of the neural processes occurring in our brains (which any perceptual event could rightly be called). The chapters of this book are vaguely titled and abhorrently long with no organization. Trite quips round out this volume and leave the reader wanting clarity and concise thought. If you want to learn about music and neuroscience, buy a book on basic neuroscience and a recording of Bach's B minor Mass. You'll learn a lot more than this book tries to spoon feed."
2,Just how narcissistic is this author?,"Sure, the small portion of the book devoted to science is somewhat sound, but the poor writing style, the annoying narrative, and the constant name-dropping speaks to who this guy must be. This book is his 15 minutes of fame, he needs to enjoy it now. Check out the lack of any other sound publications to see just who he is."
1,"love mingus, hated this band","Out of great loyalty to Mingus I saw this band play several times. He was old and sick then, heavily medicated, and beginning to die. To me, it's an embarassment to the world that he hadn't made enough money by then to retire instead of having to go out on the road with these two clowns. The man who made ""Great Concert"" with Eric Dolphy and Jaki Byard didn't need Adams and Pullen to show him a ""new"" direction. The last group of records (this one and the ""Changes"") were probably humiliating for him. When a great composer doesn't write all the music on his own record something is gone awry. I bought them anyway so he'd get the money, but I never could listen to them."
3,"Okay, but not as good as Candyass","This CD, I think, was highly overrated. Candyass was full of unique rhythms, energy, vitriol, and lyrics which enhanced the experience of the music (hard sounds where they should be hard, growling tones where the music growls). Whereas Vapor Transmission is not really anything to speak of. It's like they took their sound and toned it down to be radio friendly- I found myself wondering when the songs would ""pick up"" and many of them never did. No rhythm, little energy. Now, there are a few good songs on this CD (dreams in digital, saving faces), but for the most part, this was a goth-whine-POP album from a band I had expected more from."
4,This is hot,"Hey this album totally rocks. Not only the much played ""fiction(dreams in digital)"" but every other song that's on the album. I especially like ""Opticon"" This album continuously get me pumped up to go through the day. No other album rocks this much.I truly suggest you buy this album. It word be worth the money."
5,An Orgy of Electronica and Rock,"Vapor Transmission is an excellent album. It definitely grows on you after a while. This album is very, very addictive, but it's hard to get sick of. Although all the songs are good, the best song on this CD is ""107"". It is darkly sexy, starting out with gorgeous harmonious vocals and simple bass, then progressing to an eerie chorus. Another remarkable song is ""Eva"" with its gentle sweet guitar notes. The chorus is a little messy, but it is made up for by its beautiful layered vocals.Orgy manages to keep its ingenuity in Vapor Transmission, which is difficult to do in the music industry. This new album is totally different but it still has Orgy's unique signature sounds that were created in Candyass. I would rarely rate something 5 stars, but Vapor Transmission definitely deserves it."
4,Could of done better but Fiction is good,I loved Candyass but then Vapor Transmission comes out. I kinda disliked it. Some of the songs sounded the same unlike Candyass. Fiction is my favorite and the 2 track on Vapor Transmission is good. Of Candyass i loved everysong!
2,Not a real Orgy CD,"This album was a huge disappointment. Orgy moves in more of a guitar-centric metal direction, away from their original synth rock style. While focusing on the harder style of this record, they seem to lose touch with their melodic, electronic rock roots found on Candyass (and Punk Statik Paranoia, afterward). The album as a whole just falls flat and sound like the numerous other ""nu metal"" stuff that's out there. Sure, there's a few good ones on here like ""Fiction (Dreams in Digital)"", ""Eyes, Radio, Lies""; ""Suckerface"" and ""Eva"". But, overall I was very disappointed at the direction they started heading in with this record. Luckily for the few of us who feel this way, Punk Statik Paranoia heads back towards the same ""death pop"" feel that made us fall in love with them on their first CD."
3,Its better than Candyass....,"Ok..maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this CD just yet, as I haven't listened to it enough to let it 'sink in'. You know what I mean...At any rate...'Fiction' is a great single and a great followup to the first single from Candyass 'Blue Monday' My only gripe..I wish the song was a little bit longer! LOL Its wonderful to dance to...'Opticon' is probably my FAVORITE song on this CD....the opening bit of music makes me think of old Ministry(!)/Revolting Cocks...(betcha never associated THOSE 2 bands with Orgy!) Seeing as to how I am a big fan of Ministry and RevCo...I took that as a good thing.The rest of the CD is mediocre...with the hidden track being another strong point. Perhaps more listening will change my mind, but for now.....'Vapor' avoids the sophmore slump, but not by much."
5,The best yet,my (...) albums hardly ever leave my ears but the one that stands out the most is vapor transmission it is a great follow up of candyass which i consider one of the best albums u can buy but vapor transmission is even better but sadly not as recognizable the synthisizing is better and so are the lyrics (though a little odd at times) the melodies have also improved since the first album and it seems they play their instruments a little more fluidly and jays voice is just as perfect as before it just fits the music just right if u dont already have this one or liked the first go out and get this album its worth every cent u can pay for it
1,Piece of Crap,"I can't believe I bought this piece of crap CD. I enjoyed Orgy's first CD, but this one just sucks!! It does not even deserve stars. This is probably the worst CD I own, and believe me I love music (this is not music). If you want my advice, don't buy this garbage."
1,Why not just buy the new Manson album?,"""Hello, my name is Jay Gordon, and every Halloween, I dress up as Marilyn Manson.""Puh-leeeeeeze. This is one of the most boring albums I've ever heard. Save your money."
5,Big Improvement,"This album is awsome. It is much better than candyass(although candyass is awsome too). It keeps the same electric dark metal feel through the whole album so if you like one song you will probably like them all. Some of the Candyass guitars [stunk] like like the chorus in pantomime, but the guitars in Vapor Transmission rule. There is less synth parts but the ones one the album are very cool sounding. All the songs are good but the best are ""Sukerface"", ""Opticon"", ""Fiction"", and ""Eva"". All in all if you liked Candyass you'll probably love Vapor Transmission. If you don't have any Orgy cds yet, get this one first."
4,Worth Checking Out,"After seeing Orgy in concert, I checked out thier CD Vapor Transmission. I think sometimes their music is overshadowed by the band's image and how people respond to it. I think, image aside, its a strong piece of work. They employ keyboards and synth guitars to give the music sort of a techno feel, with dark riffs and heavy, sometimes reminding me of NIN. Fiction (Dreams in Digital) is definitely a strong point, starting out with pulsing guitars and is one of the smoother songs, also has a nice bass line. The sixth track, Eva, is also one of my favourite songs here, along with Eyes-Lies-Radio, which has a strong beat and a kinda techno influence. I think that, if a lotta people would get over the superficial aspects of Orgy, they'd find a solid CD from a band with a good future."
4,Superior follow-up to CANDYASS,"Orgy's second album is a major leap forward from CANDYASS. The overall songwriting and musicianship is a step in the right direction for Orgy.VAPOR TRANSMISSION starts off brilliantly with four outstanding tracks. ""Suckerface"", ""The Odyssey"", ""Opticon"", and ""Fiction:Dreams in Digital"". All four are extremely well written songs and above all else are very catchy! Especially, ""Fiction:Dreams in Digital"". This is the best song on the album in my opinion. It is the kind of hard pop music I like to listen to. The other notable tracks that I mentioned above are excellent hard rockers. It might take a few listens for you to like some of the songs, but they are well worth it.VAPOR TRANSMISSION kinda loses momentum after ""Fiction"", and the rest of the album is a hit and miss affair, much like CANDYASS was. But, the great songs outweigh the not so great on VAPOR TRANSMISSION and I recommend it for your music collection! It is worth your money."
4,Much better than Candyass.,"If you listen to both Candyass and Vapor Transmission, you'll notice how different each album is. Honestly, i think Vapor Transmission is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than Candyass. Don't get me wrong, I think Candyass is an ok album with some good songs like Platinum, Stitches, and Blue Monday. Vapor Transmission is so better because it's more agressive and sounds a little better than Candyass. Besides, even the members of Orgy themselves think Vapor is better than Candyass. This is a great album and i can't wait to hear their new album.Also, on another note, Orgy album sales are down and that's a reason why they haven't been touring so, anyone who reads this review, i implore you to buy this album."
5,Wow! Great cd!,"WOW! This cd is great, with just the right mix of techo and rock. Deffinatly a 5 start cd, and worth the price, even for just the songs Fiction and Eva! Vapor Transmission is a must buy!"
2,Not a fan of the middle,I quickly received this product but returned it because I did not like the middle. They are a little too bug-eyed for me. The shipper reimbursed me no problem
3,Not my favorite pair of Ray Bans,"I'm normally a fan of polarized lenses but opted for this frame even though polarized wasn't available because I liked the style and ample coverage. They do look good, but I can only give three stars because what I'm not thrilled with are the pronounced indent marks the metal frames leave on my cheeks. I've typically been very happy with Ray Bans, but this particular style was a miss for me."
1,Oversimplistic - a waste of time,"Reminds me of a Monty Python sketch - 'to play the flute, first blow in one end, then run your fingers up and down the outside of it'. That's about the level of this text. Don't bother."
4,Interesting and stimulating,"This book offers much needed information to the Internet rookie. It is good for those who have no idea how to go about making a living out of the Internet, but if you have some experience in e-commerce/Internet business you should get a book that looks into the matter with greater detail. Ironically, one such book is the author's own ""1 BUSINESS 2 APPROACHES (HOW TO SUCCEED IN INTERNET BUSINESS BY EMPLOYING REAL WORLD STRATEGIES)"" which I also read and consider a much better book. I suspect that the first part of ""121 INTERNET BUSINESSES YOU CAN START FROM HOME"" is just a summary of that book."
1,Birdcage material,This author is one of those get-rich quick schemers who is using the profits from this load of hogwash to finance his soon-to-be-released informercial making the same bogus claims. Everyone knows there is money to be made on the Net; what we don't know (and subsequently desire to know) is HOW. This book offers a bunch of lame ideas that any dim-witted fool could come up with while reading through the classified section of an income opportunity type magazine. Get real. There appears to be absolutely no original thought work put into this book. Do yourself a favor...if you really want to MAKE money...don't throw it away on this fodder for birdcage bottoms.
1,This book seems to have been written in 15 minutes.,"This is not a good book and a waste of money. The information is spotty at best. The business ideas here are mostly worthless, outdated and very few links to online samples even exist. Why would anyone publish this book?"
4,Worthwhile for Taylor fans,The author for the most part strikes that fine balance between liking his subject but still being fair and realistic in his assessment of her.
3,slow reading,"It is a little boring and not a page turner, however it does have facts and dates if one is interested in that sort of thing.I have read better books on this subject."
1,Elizabeth: The life of Elizabeth Taylor,"I did not finish reading the book but went to the back for her life timeline. i could not stay interested in the book, Sorry. I do not recommend it."
2,It's shows like this that gave Colin Baker a bad reputation,"I remember sitting in front of my TV every night and watching Doctor Who religiously, which transformed me into a Tom Baker addict and completely biased me against any of the future Doctors. It has taken over fifteen years and repeated viewings to realize that Colin Baker was excellent as the Doctor and was simply a victim of the writers. I found the acting in this show excellent from all characters(with the exception of Alexi Sayle, who only gets my forgiveness because he was a Young One). However, I watch these shows for the Doctor, and by placing him in a secondary role for the majority of the first act was infuriating. The scene order just felt terribly out of place and it slowed down the pacing. I do not know if Eric Saward wrote the plot this way, but I think with a little editing and repositioning of scenes this could have been a really memorable episode. I recommend this episode only if you are a hardcore Colin Baker fan."
3,Great characters.,"To be brief, a lot of people seem to hate this particular story. I, for one, loved it. A nice blend of action and characterization. In fact, I found it worth watching just for the characters. Orcini and Bostock, the noble(?) assassins were priceless. And Clive Swift oozes with icky smarm as Jobel.To be honest, the guest characters are so strong that the Doctor and Peri are only vaguely necessary to the plot. Always a good thing where Peri is concerned.Why people compare this unfavorably to that abomination, The Two Doctors is beyond, me."
2,"""_____________ "" of the Daleks""","This is one of my least favorite Dalek story arcs. The story isn't great, failing to justify the use of the Daleks and their creator and the cameos are weak and forced.Thanks to the 2005 reinvention of the series, not to metion the amazing revamp of the Daleks, there is plenty of Dalek DVDs to choose from and get more sci-fi-satisfaction: The Daleks (from the 1st Doctor's Beginnings Set), Genesis of the Daleks (possibly the best, see my review), Ressurection of the Daleks ( some great 5th Doctor moments)....."
4,One of the best by the 'forgotten' doctor,"Doctor Who, Daleks - Davros what could be better? A story with great sub plots and Alexi Sayle (not to mention Wiliam Gaunt and Eleanor Bron)make this one of the better Colin Baker stories and keeps on going right up to the end.Colin Baker oftern had weak stories to play such as Trial of a Time Lord which took Dr Who to previously unknown depths; but always played the part with his own inimitable style. In Revelation of the Daleks he is at his best. For those new fans of the doctor you missed the best - for those of us who saw the first episodes in 1963 Colin Baker was one of the greats - buy this and see what you missed"
1,Save your money,"This was the most god-awful boring Doctor Who story I've ever seen. And there were Daleks and Davros in it! No wonder the BBC took Dr. Who off their schedule for 18 months after this story. Colin Baker was never good at playing The Doctor, and almost killed the show for good. And that stupid costume he had makes The Doctor look more like an idiot than anything else. Oh and Alexei Sayle? Not funny! I didn't laugh once. They do find some time to mention that Americans have such bad taste, but after this garbage story I'm wondering who really has bad taste.The Doctor and Peri walk to Tranquil repose and it takes the entire 1st episode. They are attacked by one mutant in a pretty uninteresting fight sequence. The story turned into a confused mess of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot almost from the point the Doctor and Peri stepped out of the TARDIS. So save your money or buy Genesis or Resurrestion of the Daleks instead."
2,"Dr. Whom, Mark III",This was the third early Dr. Who that I bought to see how the early ones compare to the current one. I did not like Hartnell; I found Tom Baker much better in the role; Colin Baker falls between the two. I found him rather cold and distracted. The sets are better than either of the other two. The acting...feh. Not campy enough.
4,Beautiful!,"The quilt is unexpectadly soft, and not cheap feeling. The flowers are beautifully color matched, too."
5,Got soul?,"James Hand, with his distinctive quivering voice, has created a country music masterpiece. The soul of country music has found its home. I just hope it's not his last."
3,I made it!,"I decided to read this book despite all the warnings on this site. The complainers are wrong, wrong, wrong about Claire Messud's wonderful book The Emperor's Children but unfortunately they are right about this book. I should have listened to the reviewer who complained about the mudslide of words here. How true. The only thing that caputured my interest in this book was the mystery of Hannah Schneider. Who is she, why does she visit motels in the middle of the night, and who killed her? I'm proud to say that I did slog through 500 pages of book trivia, uninteresting people and events, and over-written, over-imagined blather to get to the end. I have to say that I'm glad I did. The book has a great ending that left me thinking back on it for days. For that reason, I sure wish I could recommend this book to my friends, but alas, I can't."
4,"Like A Tough Semester, Worth The Effort","Rarely have I come across a new book that divides readers so thoroughly in their opinions. This one truly seems to fall into the love-it-or-really-really-hate-it category, and it's not hard to see why. I totally sympathize with those who find it obnoxious, pretentious, slow, implausible, and unforgivably overwritten. More than once in the early going I thought about putting it down for good. And yet, I'm very glad it stuck with it. By the end, I had essentially fallen in love with Blue and was totally captivated by her mystery. The ambiguity of the conclusion is a strength more than a weakness, in my view. I will certainly be interested to see what Ms. Pessl comes up with next."
1,as pretentious and annoying as....,"hmmm...what irritating, long-winded and unwieldy comparison could I possibly use to describe this book? A tired, half-stolen premise, a hollow bunch of non-characters, and a dying-to-be-clever writing style which relies exhaustively on clunky, dead-end similes. Seriously--if you went through this book with a pencil and crossed out every awkward, fourth-rate simile, you wouldn't have much of a book left. The supposedly compelling characters of the book--the dad, Hannah, the ""Bluebloods"" don't seem to have anything intrinsically charming about them at all; we're merely supposed to rely on the narrator's weakish insistence that they're all fascinating. There just seems to be no there there, no rewarding meat on the bones. If it were more entertaining, I'd forgive the superficiality, but it seems to be an earnest attempt at something lofty and reading it was a joyless mix of tedium and sheer cringe."
1,Sigh.,"Hung in there through page 89, then realized I'm not immortal and don't have time to deal with this. Am willing to start a charitable foundation to provide Ms. Pessl a lifetime supply of Ritalin and a scholarship to the Iowa Writers Workshop. Care to join me?"
1,Pretentious and overrated,"This book is intolerably pretentious, and the dialog and characterization are terrifically out of touch with anyone's reality. Has the writer ever visited an American private high school, an American college (even--gasp!--Harvard), North Carolina? It sure doesn't feel like it. Any predictable plot twists at the end of this novel aren't worth suffering through the self-congratulatory prose (laden with possibly the worst extended metaphors ever put to paper) one has to wade through to get there."
1,Not a book with broad appeal,"As a fairly forgiving reader, I am not often inclined to do what I did today - abandoned this book to start a new one. The propensity of the writer to be ""clever"" in the longest-winded way possible combined with a plot that moves at a glacial pace finally got the better of me. I can see other readers' points about the endless witticisms on Americana that resonated with them but at some point this book crossed over into self-obsession and left me scratching my head. I guess there's a side to this book that holds out a mirror to the fans of mySpace and Facebook, but I didn't find myself needing that kind of self-validation."
2,Not for me,"I don't shy away from long books; in fact, I love them. But this particular book seemed to preen with too much self-indulgent mental gymnastics and too little story. For a story about growing up, I liked ""Prep"" better or ""Poisonwood Bible"" or Atwood's ""Cat's Eye."" Those books all go different directions than ""Calamity Physics,"" but the stories and narrators are far more appealing and involving. Mary Lawson's ""Crow Lake"" comes to mind as well."
2,Special Topics in Calamity Physics,"This seemed very pretentious, with an unnecessary amount of literary references. It was convoluted and felt like wading through mud - difficult to get through."
2,Give me a break!,"I so wanted to like this book after a review I heard on Studio 360, but I am embarrassed that I subjected my book group to it. Although some of the writing is fine, insightful, and funny, the idea that a high school teacher, Hannah, spending her free time and income entertaining her under-aged students is ludicrous (not to mention allowing a sleep over). No part-time teacher has the income to make dinners for 6 every Sunday, or to take six teen agers to a nice restaurant, drink a bottle of wine in front of them and pick up the tab (let alone keep a job). I can't imagine her editors let these complete flights of fancy through."
4,An Enjoyable Read,"I agree with other reviewers that the author would have benefited from some more agressive editing. However, I enjoyed this book very much. It's an interesting story, well told.Please don't think me too superficial, but I must comment on the dust jacket that covers this fine book---it is one of the most entertaining jackets I've ever seen!"
1,Just plain awful.,"Like so many other reviewers, I really wanted to finish this book, and wanted to like it when I was done. Neither thing happened. Gareth was a pretentious snob, Hannah a pretentious and promiscuous snob, the Bluebloods pretentious, promiscuous and spoiled snobs, and Blue just along for the ride. Was there really anyone in here to like? And why did it take 250+ pages to finally get things going? And why were there SO MANY typographical errors? Come on, editors."
4,Over Written?,"Yes, the book is loaded with more similes, metaphors and inline references than one would expect or want from a future A list author. But that is the point. The voice of the novel is a young, over-bright, book smart college freshman, just beginning to understand how to relate to people outside her small, intimate, immediate family. Kudos to Ms. Pessl for so effectively creating such a memorable literary style for Blue."
3,Specialty Topics in Hype?,"Actually, while I definitely got caught up in the hype for this first novel, it IS a worthwhile read. The first two thirds were especially compelling before it got a bit bogged down into melodrama and over the top fantasy. My willful suspension of disbelief was a bit taxed. But overall, I liked it. A solid first novel-and the literary references were a hilarious twist."
1,wasted time,"I want a novel to be about life not about titles to other books. This was not a fun read, but too shallow for a depth of involvement with the characters, plot or even writing style. This was a big waste of time. The characters boring and I am unable to continue reading...."
4,Its really a good read,"Not being an English major I just read this for entertainment and without reading any (gushing) reviews to give me overly high expectations. It is a good read and an engaging plot that I enjoyed following. The writing is a little overwrought, but that is not so bad these days. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to be entertained by a good story, without expecting great literature."
3,no exit,"One of the most difficult aspects of writing a novel is bringing things together at the end. In this sense the author fails completely. The structure of the novel is both engaging and irritating. When the story line is moved along, it is quite good. At other times, it plods. Trying to be too clever, the author has become stuck in her own honey."
3,Get the scissors...please,"I wanted so much to love this book. What a wonderful beginning. Terrific and clever idea to annotate and give visual aids. But please, this author needed a ruthless editor. Not every clever thought that drops out of one's brain like a gumball needs to be printed. Great talent though. I would have given it 5 stars had it been 200 pages shorter and it's writing more concise. Hemingway knew when to stop. Pessl needs to learn from his example."
3,She finally hooked me,"After 50 pages, I was ready to put it down a la Nancy Pearl (after 100 pages of any book, you can put it down, and if you're over 50 you can subtract your age from 100 to determine how many pages you have to endure). But by the 100th page, I was too intrigued to let it go. It's a classic YA novel - a charismatic teacher, getting in with the cool kids, etc. - but with a mysterious twist, and it goes on for 500 pages. Annoying at times, but she kept me reading, and what an eye for a simile she has!"
3,Brevity. Please.,"There's nothing to add to my review that has not already been said very well by others on this site. The book is too long and way too convoluted. I stopped caring about Blue and her absolutely worthless excuse for a father less than halfway through.The story could have been good except for the apparent desire of the author to try to impress us with her literary knowledge and give us the impression that she had read and was familiar with every movie, documentary, book, periodical, and reference work ever published. The ego of the author far surpassed her ability to write a novel that is inherently readable and worth my time to recommend.I'm sorry I spent valuable hours on it and would urge anyone who must read it to borrow, not buy."
4,Mean Girls meets Tender Is The Night meets Glamorama,"The first 150 or so pages are compelling, witty, funny, profound, moving; the middle part is lengthy and meandering but still charming and original; the fourth quarter is just out there, over-the-top, trivial; the ending is gorgeous.There is real talent here. I can't wait for Marisha Pessl to take a shot at the sort of writing that doesn't involve six-figure advances and won't land her on the New York Times bestseller list."
2,Stunned that someone would call this book stunning,"I wanted to love this book. The slobbering reviews made me salivate, too. As an English major/philosophy minor, I was intrigued by the clever-sounding premise and could not wait to spend the next few days reading the next great American novel.The premise is clever in theory; in practice, it's pretentious. The parenthetical references make reading this novel feel like jogging through a tar pit. The worst thing, however, is the clunky writing, which consists of at least 10000 similes, metaphors and descriptions that grated on my brain. If you think ""a nervous, empty canteen"" and ""backpacks...lined up like old men"" are the height of clever, then you may enjoy this book and its 99,998 other descriptive phrases and similes. I would mention more of them for your amusement but I could not get rid of this book fast enough."
2,Lots of words,"I suspect this is one of those books that many people will like but I don't; same experience with other idiosyncratic novels such as Confedarcy of Dunces, with which this book shares the claustrophobic-making central character. The voice of the narrator certainly is consistent--no noun goes unmodified, no concept goes unexplained, no scene lacks in detail (e.g., I'm sure the narrator wouldn't eat 'a hotdog' but 'a Kahns premium twelve inch hotdog with a whole wheat bun, Heinz Ketchup, yellow mustard with just a smidgen of that relish that you buy on the third shelf of the Krogers with the vibrant green sheen and well blended texture."") Drives me crazy. But others must like it I'm sure. Plot? Yep, it must be in there somewhere, and I bet it's a good one too. Guess the bottom line: what the author does, she does well--I just don't have an appreciation for it. Think I'll read some Hemingway next to counteract the verbiage."
2,A bit juvenile,"Maybe this would be a good teenager read. For an adult, the first 2/3 of the book as a trip through a young girl's high-school years and childhood. The end of the story gets juicy, but not really until then. You have to make yourself keep reading."
3,Gave Up,"I tried and I tried and I tried again, but just couldn't make it. The self-consciously clever narrator was too present, and the story too dull, so I found myself wandering off to more interesting activities, like sleep.But she has great potential as a writer; I look forward to the next."
2,We get it: you're well read,"I gave up on this book on page 100. The prose was insufferable. What was the reason for deluging the reader with hifonated pseudo-adjectives? Longwinded, verbose, writing which fails to advance the plot which is most fit for an indie movie.Blue van Meer is too unrealistic a character. She seems a caricature, having read Mein Kampf in the second grade. Of course, in the spirit of the novel's narrative, a pretentious citation of Mein Kampf's author follows.This novel should be read as a satire of our obsession with gifted children and academic elitism."
4,"Have Yet to Finish, but its great!","This book is very hard to read because there are so many references. It confuses me sometimes because I'm wondering...Who actually knows what the author is talking about? Although, that is what intrigues me. It leaves me guessing! It makes me want to strive to figure out exactly what the author is trying to say. I am hooked and can't wait to finish the novel."
2,"Sophmoric, but a good freshman effort","This book has often been compared toRabid: A Novel, as they are both academia-inspired suspenseful lit novels filled with elegent language and philosophy, but Special Topics is much longer and yet, somehow, slighter.If I had not read Rabid so soon before Special Topics, I would have liked Special Topics better. However, Special Topics pales by comparison. It feels diffuse. The characters in Special Topics seem weaker, wussier, and more impressed with their own wittiness than truly intelligent.I'm trying to judge it on its own merits, but when you've read a superior book along the same lines quite recently, it's difficult to be objective."
3,Metaphored to Death,"This is the book for you if you think everything in life is a simile or a metaphor. The story is related from the POV of a teenaged girl who is incapable of any depth of thought and retreats to literary references and devices to try to mask her inadequacies. Sadly, the impression that is left is that it isn't the character but the author who hides behind the mask. Many of the metaphors and similes were apt and might have entertained if used with restraint. The presence of dozens per page made the book seem like an exercise rather than a serious work. Pretty much a waste of time."
1,Not impressive,"This book was the most unnecessarily overwritten piece of pretension I have ever read! Do not be impressed by the annoying references to so many other things to get to the point, the borrowed phrases and quotes from everyone from scholars to rappers. It reads like it was written by a gnat on crack who suffers from ADD. Enough already! Speaking of quotes, I have one for you in a perfect description of this book: Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothin'- (James Brown). If you are into wordy, intelligent pieces that make sense, I suggest Stanley Crouch's works."
4,An Engaging First Novel,"This is a first novel and a really impressive one, in my opinion. Pessl tells the story of Hannah, an intellectually precocious teenager being raised by her itinerant professor father who gets involved in solving the murder of a teacher at the private school she is spending a year attending. It's very cleverly plotted, often funny, interesting characters and the mystery is good, too!"
3,"Lots of Secrecy, Not Much Empathy","Marisha Pessel has capitalized on our love of mysterious secret societies in this novel, a theme that has propelled other big books (think ""The Da Vinci Code"") to the bestseller list. Blue van Meer, the hyper-intellectual wallflower, is doomed to remain constantly on the road with her dashing father as he tours US universities after the tragic death of his wife. Their decision to stay an entire year in one town has dire consequences for them both. I wanted to care about all of the characters that find themselves in Blue's path, but found that task difficult. I certainly enjoyed pieces of this novel with the illustrations a particularly interesting addition, but found Blue rather tiresome. Without giving too much away, the ending wraps up cleverly, which helped redeem this book slightly in my long-term memory."
1,"good plot, horrible writing","I have been trying to read this book for three days now. I thought the plot sounded really promising, and was looking forward to a good read. Between the endless wordiness and run-on sentences that seem to be forming complete paragraphs, this is an absolute nightmare to slog through. I highly recommend that this author take a couple of creative writing classes; and that the editor learn to edit properly.I am VERY disappointed."
2,Maybe I just don't see it...,"but how, how is this inflated, twee book reminiscent of Nabokov? Nabokov's use of language made his sentences feel like music and his allusions never took you out of the book. If Special Topics is music, then it's clunky, overly busy music. Possibly performed with hammers. The big surprise was just that, a surprise. There weren't enough hints throughout the book, and Blue's sudden influx of memories after the fact seemed only to emphasize that point."
3,Not quite a calamity,"Marisha Pessl shows real promise as an author, but Special Topics in Calamity Physics needs, at the very least, a good edit. Some of the clues to the mystery need to be planted earlier, and the unravelling of the mystery in the end is presented in a monologue rather than an action scene. The writing is (too) thick with metaphor and cluttered with unnecessary references. These seem gratuitously compiled to convince us of the erudition of the main character, and by inference the author, but in the end they just get in the way of what was otherwise a pretty good whodunnit. On the positive side, some of the metaphors positively sparkle with freshness and the characters emerge distinctly. One hopes Pessl's next book is trimmer and more polished."
3,"Characters are interesting, but pacing is off","It took me some time to get through this book. Like others who reviewed this book, I got most of the way through the book before I decided to actually complete it. I don't want to spoil the beginning of the book (if such a thing is actually possible), but it starts out with a jolt, and you are reading to discover what lead to the jolt. Unfortunately, it takes too long to get to the jolt.The main characters - Blue and her father - are interesting. The rest are ciphers. I kept mixing up two of the boys in the main group that Blue hung out with.The book is 500+ pages. Honestly, I wish it had been about 200 pages less.I will give the book this; the twist at the end is good, and the voice that tells the story stays true."
2,Sigh...tedious is the perfect word.,"Other reviewers said it, not me. But I don't know how they can give this book 4 or 5 stars when they're all struggling to get through it. I gave up on it more than half way through--I've got too many other options, and if I'm going to muddle through a book, it's got to keep me more entertained than this.I really wanted to like this book, and I did enjoy it at the beginning; however, the erudite ""in"" jokes and references got old fast. I realized quickly that I didn't like the voice of the narrator, and it turn, didn't really care what happened to her or any of the twitty kids she hangs out with.I should give my copy away to save someone else the money. Any takers?"
2,I wish I could recommend this...,"...but I cannot. It was beautifully written with many pretty turns of phrase, and word-perfect observations, but that's the problem -- there was more emphasis on the words and less on the content. I believe that this writer is the clever and intellectual heroine she writes about, but she misses the soul and core of telling a story. What might have been a terrific mystery is a long, drawn-out, FLAT story line that then feeds you all the information that you might have been gathering and sleuthing to involve you in the mystery. By the last few chapters, you dislike the characters so much that you don't care what happens to any of them. Don't discount this author, she may have future good books up her sleeve if she learns to interest others in her as much as she is interested in herself."
3,"too much razzle, not enough dazzle","Pessl is undoubtedly a talented writer with a gift for turning an unusual phrase. But this book is clever and occasionally fun without being in the least bit satisfying. The characters are one-dimensional and seem cut out from an Alicia Silverstone vehicle; and their voices are so indistinguishable that it's impossible to know who's talking unless you carefully trace back the strings of conversation. After about 200 pages the plot does finally start to pick up and become a fun, interesting read, but the gleeful page-turning finally leads you to a wholly implausible denoument and no emotional resolution to speak of."
3,Annoyingly wordy for no good reason,"Although this book has some redeeming features, its most prominent feature is that the very texture of the narrative is constantly annoying. The narrator never stops yammering, using far more words than could gracefully contribute to the progress of the story. As a result the reader is ever aware of the author's role in writing the book, as though she needs the reader to be thinking about her, not the story, at all times.This is for me just the opposite of what I prefer in a novel. A good read allows me to lose myself in the story and forget I'm reading a book written by an author, much as an excellent performance in a movie allows the viewer to forget that a character is really an actor acting."
2,"Trite, affected","I admit I am not done with this book yet, but can bearly read it. This book is terribly written and the addition of peculiar, academic references (think SAT vocab prep meets cultural literacy booklist) just does not help! Who was this author's editor? Try Heaven's Lake for better first novel."
1,unbearable,"Why did this book receive any good reviews? For all the verbal gymnastics, it is quite tedious and very boring."
3,The author is trying too hard to be sophisticated...,So far I have read 250 pages and though the book has a nice flow the verbosity of the author and various literary citations all over the place are wearing me out. The plot is very simple but it seems that the author is trying to add some kind of a literary weight to the book by citing every possible book and journal she came across in her life. This exuberance of references and citations makes the novel very annoying to real - it is a very awkward mix of styles.
3,well written but pretentious!,I thought based on the glowing reviews this would be absolute genius but the main character bugged me a little and I found her too overdone and hard to relate to with the incessant inserts of literary references.
1,Pretentious to a degree..,"I struggled through to page 150 before I gave up - and I don't give up on books very often. After 150 pages I was still waiting for something interesting to happen - this wouldn't have been SO bad had it not been for the irritatingly pretentious style. It's one of those books where on almost every page the reader is confronted with the author's intellectual superiority - you probably know the sort of thing - countless references to obscure books, wandering discussions on subjects of little interest, copious use of foreign phrases without translation - all in a kind of sub-Nabokovian style which sets my teeth on edge.Obviously I have some kind of blind spot - I can see that a lot of people have rated this book very highly. Try to read a few pages before you buy - I think you'll either love it or hate it.."
2,A lot of building up to... this ending?,"I'm not surprised that this book is being turned into a Hollywood movie - its plot and depth should fare well there. The first two thirds of the book spend a lot of time, and as a few other reviewers have noted, a lot of words (so many asides, parentheticals, comparisons, and citations), introducing the reader to a small group of potentially interesting but mostly one dimensional characters. The narrator's voice is clever at first, even a little endearing, but the endless run of words becomes tedious pretty quickly. One starts to yearn pretty quickly for something to happen, for the events continually foreshadowed from page one to finally take this book somewhere. And then, I don't know, 400+ pages in, they do. And the book careens into B movie plot territory. And ends with a quiz."
5,Fabulous,"I loved this book. Why do some people dislike it so much? Perhaps they don't realize that the ""pretentious"" language is an essential part of the narrator's persona. People shouldn't confuse the narrator with the author. The verbosity itself is utterly creative and refreshing. The literary references, when understood, enhance the reading experience. It's a shame that our hurried culture predisposes people to favor only those books with concise prose and to-the-point plots. This book is to be savored. While it's not perfect, the book is a unique and wonderful debut."
3,"Pretentious, but fascinating","This book engaged me completely at first but then became quickly annoying. The conclusion isn't created intelligently (no clues sprinkled about earlier - unless I missed them in the unrelenting prose) I just felt blindsided... interesting characters, good dialog but could have used more work before publication."
3,Wordy but interesting,The book got off to a very slow start but it picked up towards the middle. The central characters are well depicted and larger than life but the wordy style of writing detracted from the story.
3,Or as Danny Kaye might have asked,"In discussing this book,with all its allusions and stylistic brio, one must ask the essential question concerning the character's development-Does this vessel of Ms. Pessl have a Blue that is true?"
3,Holden Caulfield+Nancy Drew+Dennis Miller,"If Holden Caulfield and Nancy Drew had a love child with Carrie Fisher as the godmother, and that daughter wrote a book featuring endless arcane references a la Dennis Miller, this'd be that book. It's an impressive debut. This author seems to revel in language and the conceit of the reading list is an interesting frame for the chapters. The quirky tone is engaging to start with but it wears thin about halfway through. Then we're left with the realization that the characters are thinly drawn and the plot is as improbable as... well, something from the Carolyn Keene factory."
2,Too many words,A gripping mystery or at least it would be if presented as a short story of 40 pages or less. The author seems determined never to make a point in three words if it can be spread over three pages and display her erudition at the same time. Clint Thomas
2,"If you like CUTE, this is for you.","On and on about a bunch of precocious, bratty high school seniors, most certainly heading for disaster, but after reading and mostly suffering through 40% of this pretentious novel, I threw in the towel, so I would never know except that Pessl tells you right at the beginning. Maybe if you are young, this would serve, but otherwise the world does not need one more of these. It's been done over and over and certainly better."
4,Attention! Read the entire book!,"Several one star reviewers did not read past page 100. This book is very slow to start but it picks up the pace AND FAST. It is very well written and clever. Give it a go, you will love it!!"
1,Lacks tour de force...,"This CD has some good songs on it and Mrs. Avis gives a gentle, romantic interpretation to the songs; but her voice lacks tour de force that cabaret style singing requires. These songs would be better sung with a stronger voice."
1,Smoke and Mirrors,Yanna's performance reminds one of Mr.Avis'cars for 2004. Shiny on the outside but lacking true performance under the hood. You are impressed with the French accoutrements.....but realize there is no heart or soul. It is as if there is something odd in the performance and delivery. The voice is almost masculine in it's timbre and range....which is totally not congruent with Yanna's pictures on the net. Are the soundtracks truly Yanna's creation or is this smoke and mirrors...........????
3,"Not his best, and it's too damn bad","The only people who know who Martin Sexton is are absolute groupies. I've followed him around on his tours as much as I can provided I'm a poor college student- and I'm sorry to say that none of his albums will come close to his live power. So if you can't go to a concert and you're looking for a great album, one of those to listen to in the dark while sitting on the porch, this is a good one. Good blend of peppy, melancholy, and singable melodies. However, it just doesn't live up to its potential. It pales in comparison to ""Black Sheep."" And while I'm glad Atlantic Records signed him on and he'll have a wider audience, I think they have done nothing good for his sound. Why can't major record labels just accept folkies as they are and not try to recreate them for the masses? Buy Black Sheep first, then In the Journey, then the American, then this one...."
1,Too religious,"I donated this CD to our library. Martin must have been going through some religious phase as these songs sound like christian music. If you want some good Martin Sexton, get the American CD."
4,Ties That bind ties that Break,This is a remarkable book about the life of Ailin Tao in China at the turn of the century. Ailin faces many hardships considering she is pro revalutionand her family is against it. This is a great book to read if you enjoy Historical fiction. happy readingeliza Abramson 11
3,very daring,This is a book about a girl named ailin who lives in china in 1911 and refuses to get her feet bound.this ruins her arranged marrage.Later she becomes a nanny for two children named billy and grace.Once billy got sick nad ailin had to go around Nanjing to find a doctor.Around 3/4 into the book Ailin and the misionaries leave for san francisco.On the ship she meets james chew.Ailin ends up staying in san francisco with james chew.I think that ailin was very bold and daring to make the move to san fracisco forever
3,Boring!!!,"This was on my summer reading list. And I though perhaps just perhaps this book is actully good. But to my surprise it wasn't the least bit good. Don't waste your time with this book! It was okay in the beginning. But it then soon dulled torward the end. It was highly predictable! And it seemed as if everything in Ailin's life was perfect. Like not a single thin could go wrong! And truly nothing did go wrong torward the end. It was a pitiful piece of writing! Don't read it, it's horrible."
3,"ties tht binds,ties that break","The book ""Ties that bind, Ties that break,"" is a pretty good book. The book's main character is a girl named Ailin who didn't want her foot bound (or no man will marry you). So, she had a choice to be a farmer's wife, a nun or a baby maker. So, she chooses to be a baby sitter. So she baby sited the kids. So she earned money to live in."
3,I am only reading it because its a requirement for my next school grade,"Is this book good, because i have to read it, its a school requirement. I want to know if this book is worth buying, because if its not worth it i'd rather go to my public library"
4,ties that bind ties that break reveiw,"Like all other girls in China 5 year old Ailin Tao is going to get her feet bound. Ailin is devastated to hear that she will never run through the court yard again. instead of running around freely she will hobble around forever,Ailin refuses to have her feet bound. I thought that this book very intresting. I love the way the Lensey Namioka expresses the emotions of each character. she is a great author. This book deeply expresses all of the things going through Ailin's mind. I would definitely recommend this book."
4,Strong female chinese heroine,"Namioka creates a strong female character in Ailin, who must fight social and cultural stereotypes in early 20th century China. Ailin a young girl fights to change her future and destiny by not having her feet bound, a tradition that goes back centuries in China. By doing so she must find strength in herself as she explores a new culture, language and world."
5,Great Book,"This was a great book that I loved all the way through. I read it very fast, partly because it's only a young adult book and partly because it is so good. It gave a great portrayal of the times back then, and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,Chnese Feet,"Ties that bind, ties that break is a pretty good book I think. the only problem with it is that most of the story is about this girl named Ailin. The Chinese tradition is that Chinese boys are attracted to Chinese girls who have bound feet. Bound feet is when they take a strip of cloth and wrap it around there feet so tat the toes will curl under there foot to make them break. It is a painful process but that is what boys would look at first back then. Ailin did not want her feet to be bound because she wanted to run really fast and if you have bound feet you basically just hobble around. My only question about this book is how can you write almost a whole book on feet. If I tried to write a whole book on Chinese feet it would probably be a page or two. Overall this book got three stars because they did a good job on explaining it and they kept the reader involved. But I have read better books but it is a book that would be in the middle of my rankings."
3,Good but too predictable,"My 13-year old was assigned this for a summer reading book. Here are his comments:""The first two chapters featured a Chinese girl who kept saying she didn't want to bind her feet. At that point, I knew that she would eventually move to a country where foot binding was not done, and indeed, that's what the story was about. I did, however, learn something about Chinese foot-binding."""
3,Fair!,"Works great, but wears down pretty fast.I have usedthe octagon shape blade... which lasts much longer, butalso a bit more expensive. You always get what you pay for."
4,Wonderful Overview of the Franks,"This is an excellent history book. James has a succinct yet enlightening narrative style. This text is chock full of brilliant asides, quotes, and archaeological, linguistic, and sociological sources and arguments. James does a wonderful job examining issues from all sides and pointing out where evidence is weak, conflicting, or rock solid. This is one of the best brief histories I have read in quite a while. Highly ecommended for anyone interested in early European, ancient French, Roman, Celt, or otherwise Frankish history."
2,The Franks,The book was in excellent condition except the fact that it does not have the outside cover to illustrate what the book is.
5,Tech N9ne - The most lyrically inclined artist on the planet,"This CD is totally off the hook. I have yet to hear a song from Tech N9ne I have disliked, he is the best rap artist out there right now, and I don't believe there could ever be a rap artist that was better. If you like this CD, get all of Tech N9ne's CD, you will be pleased, I GUARANTEE IT!"
5,Best Tech album ever.........,"You'll be hooked in the begining, Tech really shows off his skills on this album, this is my undisputable favorite Tech N9ne album to date"
3,Tight Rapper but the beats are the same same same,Tech N9ne is on one for real. Few can do what he does if any. This album shows the MW. It would be cool if he could hook up with some new production because his beats are all the same. He needs to get back on the edge of his muzik. Even Dre' doesn't make the same 1992 Dre beats (Eminem) anymore.
3,"Some great, some good, some bad","When it's bad, it's lousy -- but when it's good, it's terrific.Songs like ""Philosopher of the Streets,"" and ""The Silence of the Dawn"" really drag the piece down with overly-simplistic melodies and odd lyrics.But then you hear ""Alchemy,"" a haunting ballad sung by Frollo (Dared Wright) as he attempts to understand his his feelings for Esmerelda (Susan Rubin), or ""A Star in One Man's Universe,"" another beautiful ballad sung together by Frollo, Phoebus (Mark Light-Orr) and Quasimodo (Chip Phillips), and all is forgiven. These two pieces alone make the CD worthwhile.My favorite cut is ""Making My Own Way By,"" Esmerelda's introductory piece. Susan Rubin's voice is a treat.You'll have to wade through some rough cuts to get to the highlights, but the CD is still a worthwhile purchase. And certainly this is a more emotionally mature version than that made by Disney, much truer to the story and the times."
5,Simple Everyday Things And Thoughts To Improve Your Life,"This is the very book that spoke directly to my heart and touched me. I read it again and again now and then for the last six years - and I don't think I'll ever stop. Every single line is a tip, a piece of advice to help you nourish or heal your heart and your solve. Read the book and you'll see things diffrently. You're gonna estimate simple, happy, hopefull everyday things and find yourself cheering up. Buscaglia came up to be my teacher, my spiritoual leader. I am grateful to the one who recommended Buscaglia's books to me. I've already gifted this book to my friends and I highly suggest you to read it."
5,"Wonderful, joyful, uplifting, and marvelous!!!",This cassete can easily lift someone up to a higher level of emotional well-being. Leo Buscaglia is a superb speaker who brings his message to life in every syllable. Truly a must have for anyone who wants the most out of life!
5,How to experience love in life.,"My first read of Living, Loving & Learning was back in the 80s when I was a teenager. I could not put it down. Now that I am 41, and have recently survived cancer and divorce I am rereading this book and embracing every word. This book contains essential ingredients to live the way of love in life and Leo speaks to it so effortlessly. It is all very simple, as the philosopher Descartes so elequently said: ""I love, therefore I am."" If you are a human being and desire to experience love in life, this book is for you.Author/Speaker Lauren Miller: Hearing His Whisperwww.laurenemiller.com"
5,Excellent.,There's a lot of books I've read about touchy-feely stuff over the years but this guy is the real thing. Read it and feel better - about everything.
5,HUGS HUGS HUGS!,What a wonderful teacher Mr. Buscaglia was! This book should be read by every human on earth -- maybe then we would all have more humanity and love and peace. Not to mention the fact that it teaches us to love ourselves because of who we are and he teaches us to learn about US and each other! WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL! GO HUG SOMEONE TODAY! Thank you for keeping this magnificent man's books in publish!
5,loved it,Loved this book and was glad to share an out of print classic with special people as gifts. thanks for a great job.
5,Excellent thought provoking and deeply moving book.,"I picked this book out based upon its' title alone without knowing what an excellent writer buscaglia was going to be. Although this book is a compilations of his discussions to groups of teachers, it is really a book on how to become the true you and the meaning of living. You can't read this book without it moving you and stirring you to rethink life. I highly recommend it for everyone."
2,One Size Doesn't Fit All,"I'm glad people like Leo Buscaglia. Really, I am. If he helps people, fantastic. However, after receiving the book as a gift, I felt smothered by his ""love talk"", sounding for all the world like a medicated flower child. Considering that his ideas coalesced in the 60's, this may not be far from the truth. The book is a bit like mind control, and I'm sure his speaking presence was compelling. However, I think optimism is best tempered by reality and concrete steps, rather than this unedited exhortation to ""love"". A simplistic order to love is not going to work for most people. Love must be tempered with reason, intellect, responsibility, and experience. Life is a battlefield, and we are the soldiers. Choose a side and keep your eye on your enemy."
1,Lots of rambling,"This book is full of contraction. And it is suppose to be a book about unconditional love yet there is many condition. For example: Love cares, Love gives, Love say yes, etc. The cares, give and ""say yes"" are condition. This book has many hidden mental virus that most people do not have an anti-virus program in their head to eradicate. And unless your are a ""WOP"" as he put it in his book, it would not apply to you. You are unique and difference thus his view would not apply to you. Last I heard that he is dead. What does that tell about him? He is a failure in taking care of his health. Why would you want to identify yourself with a failure? Probably died of a heart attack as I notice he was fat and over weight."
5,"Absolutely fabulous, a treat for the soul","I have studied Leo since 1971 and have read almost all of his books. This book, I feel, is by far his best work. The book is always positive about being human and the unlimited power we have to love and share our uniqueness with each other. Leo never puts people down and always teaches us to enhance our virtues and uniqueness which helps eliminate our faults by concentrating on our virtues and uniqueness. This book has helped me understand people better and allowed me to open up more and share. The book concentrates on the good in people and teaches us how to enhance our loves and living life."
5,One of the best books I've ever read...,"This book was excellent. It really showed me what a passionate life could be...Leo reminds us that life is for the living, and that we need to make the most of every minute of it. He also reminds us that fundamentally we are unique and lovable creatures, God made no mistakes when he made any of us. Wonderful book with a positive impact."
3,Solid Professional Vocal & Pop Trance,Nothing spectacularly new or different - just a solid collection of vocal & pop trance tracks. Nothing that will make you run to the DJ and ask 'what was that?' but it's all solid and professional.
5,Flippin' Hilarious!,"Okay, so maybe I'm easily entertained, but this is still super funny every time I read it. I even laugh out loud when I watch other people read it. I originally bought the book because ""Dogzilla"" looks EXACTLY like my dog. He's full of attitude, so I usually get the response ""Oh, so THAT'S where Toby came from!"" I LOVE this book."
4,Doggie Antics,We read this book at school. It is one of the funniest stories I have ever read. Then I found out we had a copy of the book in our school library! I have read other books Dav Pilkey has written. Dog Breath was great! Our school librarian cannot keep the Captain Underpants books on the shelves. I recommend you read Dogzilla. You will LOVE it!
4,Christmas Gift,"I purchased this as a gift for a family friend, who said this book was a ""favorite"" as a child. Thank you."
5,Pilkey Rocks!,"I was first introduced to this book by a second grade student who told me Dav Pilkey was his favorite author. I was just impressed that a second grader knew an author much less had a favorite one. After I read this book and Kat Kong, Pilkey became my favorite too! I know purchase the two books frequently to read to kids of all ages. I usually end up giving the copies to some ""lucky"" kid in the crowd, and I always purchase more for my next reading visit. KIDS LOVE PILKEY!! (and so does this adult)"
5,Wow!!,"Chalee Tennison's new CD ""This Woman's Heart"" is truly amazing. From the opening notes of ""Yes I was"" through the chilling ""Go back"" Chalee hits a homerun with this CD! I can't stop playing it!"
5,The Awful Secret,A big fan of this Author and this series.The author makes you feel like you're there in that time period.
3,Da Vinci Knock Off,The story is pretty good from 12th century in remote island of England. The character as good and likable. There is a good medival feel. There are some intersting insights to the Templars as well a english period law and customs.
3,Easy understanding of Values and Ethics,Bruce Weinstein has figured out a simple way to make a complicated subject easy to understand. Well written because the process he takes you through is easy to understand. Best part? Real Life situations where these principles need to be applied.
3,"Good idea, but...","I was really excited about these utensils, but my daughter still had a hard time with these. The handles are great because they are big, but it is akward to scoop, and the fork can't ""stab"" things that arent really thick. It works good on pasta, but not on eggs, as the eggs crumble and fall apart when ""stabbed""; even pasta tends to shread into a couple pieces if the bite isn't rushed to the toddler mouth right away...which what toddler learning to eat can move it that quickly?! Great item, but for older toddlers."
2,Baby Eating Utensils,"They are a nice feature being that they change colors to notify you when the food is too hot to eat. Otherwise, the curvature of the handle is a bit difficult and needs to be lengthened just a bit to make it worth the child not turning the spoon and fork over and spilling the food on themselves or the floor or tray. I do like the color change; however. It's like measuring the temperature in a hot bathtub. LLO'C"
1,11 Bucks for cow debris .... R U kidding ?,"I am scanning for a good buy on dog bones and as wonderful as these bones may be, their cost is crazy. On a cheap dinner we can feed our entire family of 2 teenage boys, young lady and parents for about that much.Ill buy another kind thank you :-X"
4,Another great excursion from FAX,"Now in its fourth incarnation, the multi-talented duo of Pete Namlook (FAX label mastermind) and Bill Laswell offer up perhaps their best Psychonavigation chapter yet. ""Arena"" is an expansive chill-out...an example of what really good ambient-techno is all about. ""Samira"" explores traditional Turkish/Middle-Eastern music(in the same vein as Pete's excellent 'Sultan' project with Burcan Ocal). ""ENTIB 2060"" is the effective centerpiece: a slinky space journey chock full of Laswell's signature funk and hip hop beats. One of the best electronica releases of 1999, which, as an import, won't find its way to many ears here in America."
2,Interesting failure,"Imagine encountering the line: ""Gifted with integrating intelligence, Arrian synthesized experience as he took it in - he framed the new in the known, reframed the known in the new"" in a book centering around an Indiana preacher's son accepting his sexual orientation - homosexual. Place the line in the context of half a book structured as a response to Franny and Zooey by Salinger - response either by the 15 year old ... or the 40 year old he became. Add to this some sloppy thought - confusing the offerings of Cain and Abel. You are now envisioning the better part of Wind of Knives.However, at the end of the book, especially the scene at the youth leader retreat, or the phone call to his younger brother, you suddenly slip into a well written and interesting book. Unfortunately this is by far the smaller portion of the book."
5,An Obie worthy peformance by Totten,As a resident of NYC and an avid theater goer I try to find new and interesting shows to attend versus the over-commercialized spectacles that sometimes find their way to the Broadway stage. I was thrilled by the performances of Matthew S. Morris and particularly Christopher Totten. His performance was riveting and I love the fact that aspects of this performance live on on this cast recording.
2,Not so good Diet Root Beer,I wasn't at all impressed with Boylan Diet Root Beer! With the great reviews it had I thought it was worth the price. The Root Beer had a strange aftertaste and it was very flat. I'll stick to Stewarts Diet Root Beer.
4,Good Character Development,"A well written trilogy (although the 3rd book is split to two books making it a 4-book series.) Of particular note is the way Tad Williams was able to evidence the evolving perspective of Simon (the protagonist) as he matures from a kitchen boy to a ... well let's not give it away. The plot starts out a little slow, with good character development, but the pace picks up later. There are intersting plot twists, and themes that carried across the books - This is not a series where each book can stand alone (other than the 1st one of course) as each book builds on the previous one. I enjoyed it!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"After those on the side of good, e.g. not the Storm King and hisservants work out the whole deal with the three powerful swords, theremust come a final reckoning, especially after so many pages already.Guess what though, this does have princesses, as well as thedragon. Here, one needs rescuing, and one is crazy, there is still awar to be won and nonhumans to deal with."
5,This Guy Makes Robert Jordon look like Disney World,The forces of the reluctant hero Prince Joshua have finally started to make a comeback. All free creatures left in this universe must band together and defeat once and for all the forces of the evil King Elias and his evil minister.This book is not for the faint of heart(at over 800 pages) but it is a good storyThe action has really picks up in this book and the ending while you can see it coming from some ways off it will not leave you disappointed. I look forward to reading more of this author and suggest that the rest of you do the same.
2,"At last, the end...","The only reason I read this book is that I'd already made a 2400+ page commitment and I'm just plain stubborn. At least it picked up. Simon's height wasn't mentioned for anywhere in the first 70 pages. I should have probably given it 3 stars, but I'm just so bitter about Part 1...I have the feeling that the author came up with a really good idea for a dramatic plot twist, and tried to come up with a plot based on the twist. Then he figured that the longer he could stretch out the series, the more dramatic the twist would appear. So he rambled on and on and on and on... Yes, it was a clever twist, but it would have been just as good at the end of 1800 pages instead of 3000 pages. Actually, it might have been even better."
5,Satisfying conclusion to a great series,"First of all, I must say that I'm giving this 5 stars to the whole trilogy. ""To Green Angel Tower"" I would give 4 and a half. Beginning of ""Dragonebone chair"" was a little slow, but when Morgenes died, everything started to flourish. Action, adventure, horror - the book had everything a fantasy fan can wish. ""Stone of Farewell"" was even more interesting to read. What I liked best about these books is that some of main characters are being killed. In a fantasy genre, it's pretty hard to find an author who wold kill his heroes. What I don't like about ""To Green Angel Tower"" is ending. This kind of utter happyend is not in accord to the rest of trilogy. The other thing is this scullion-becomes-king cliche. I suspected that Simon was of noble blood when he collected Thorn and killed the dragon, but I was hoping that in the end he would go away and live with Sithi. Nevertheless, it's a great fantasy series and I hope Tad Williams will write many more like this."
3,"Great book, terrible product","The book itself is wonderful, and incredibly well-written. A great conclusion to the trilogy. Unfortunately, however, the e-book version is riddled with typos. Not the end of the world, but very distracting."
3,That's It?!!!!,"You know, for a while I was really enjoying this series. Even though I thought the pace dragged considerably in places, I was won over by Williams' far-flung imagination, wit and utter conviction in portraying his fantasy. As the series wore on - and on and on and on - I began to tire of his nitpicking style which at first I considered meticulous but soon found to be bloated. I became increasingly frustrated by chapter and narrative breaks because just as Williams was building up to something interesting, he would cut away. In the right hands, this device increases tension and induces suspense within the reader. Here, it induces only sighs as the audience realizes it's going to have to slog through less interesting material to get back to that intriguing premise. At that point, any and all excitement has been sufficintly squashed. Williams is a writer of immense talent with an epic eye for detail but what he really needs is a more demanding editor."
5,An excellent Series,"Memory Sorrow and Thorn is the first fantasy series I read. It is still one of my favorite. Tad Wiliams describes a world with patience and consistent improvement. With the final part of To Green Angel Tower he doesn't disappoint. Good fantasy needs a bad guy that is fun to read about. Pyrates is such. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style of Lord of the Rings. It is not entirely original like Tolkien's work, but it is creative and entertaining. One can see where Robert Jordan got many of his plot devices. Williams does it first and better."
5,"Tough, sturdy yet light","This is my fourth Stanley organizer and I find them to be perfectly built for the job. The lid is hinged properly so as to never slide to the side and spill contents. They stack nicely on each other and they don't leave marks if you bump them on walls. The handles are very comfortable. I use these for home, car and the boat. Very handy."
1,WHY NO SUB-TITLES FOR DEAF?,"I'M TRYING MY BEST TO NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WHEN GREAT DVD'S LIKE THIS COME OUT AND THEY HAVE NO SUB-TITLES OR CLOSED-CAPTIONING. IF EVERYONE WENT WITHOUT THEIR SENSE OF HEARING FOR ONE DAY THEY WOULD FIND THAT THEY COULDN'T DO THEIR JOB, ANSWER A PHONE, WATCH A TV SHOW OR GO TO A MOVIE OR HEY - HOW ABOUT WATCH A DVD UNLESS YOU CAN READ LIPS WHILE THE PERSON HAS THEIR BACK TO YOU. THINK ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE ELSE UNLESS YOU WROTE EVERYTHING DOWN ON PAPER. IT SURELY WOULD BE QUIET. BUT THAT IS JUST FOR ONE DAY. HOW ABOUT HALF A LIFETIME? IT'S NOT SYMPATHY THAT I AM LOOKING FOR. I AM LOOKING FOR COMPASSION AND PEOPLE TO LOOK AS THE WHOLE PICTURE (ALL OF US) AND NOT JUST THE HEARING. I DON'T LEAVE OUT THE BLIND IN THIS CONVERSATION EITHER."
5,Excellent,So Easy to follow. Powerful experience for first time users and experienced yoga practitioners. I love it. Maya is awesome.
5,Only the beginning...,"As my title suggests, I have only just begun reading this book. I am thrilled, however, with the insights and information that I have gleaned so far. I recommend this book. Thanks!"
2,Dissapointed,"After reading all the glowing reviews on the internet, I was pretty disappointed. I picked some up from walmart and despite 3 or 4 doses, following several recommended application methods, it simply failed to remove anything. Now maybe our rust stains are mixed with other hard water deposits, but they stayed on there just as crusty, yellow and orange as ever."
2,not super,"I got this with such high hopes that it would, as promised, fix a few new shirts that got ruined. Our water got nasty when the water company dug and I had some new shirts ruined. I followed the directions and it didn't do a darn thing, I doubled it like the directions state and soaked longer for ""tough"" stains. NOTHING! It didn't even take the stains out of the toilet. What a waste."
5,There's More to Willie Than Marijuana,"Willie has not always been on top, and his views on life are uplifting. The book is part a mini-bio of Willie's convoluted life, part inspiration to tell how to get back on your feet when you fall or keep moving forward when it seems there are obstacles in your way, and some good ideas for the survival of the planet, all interspersed with Willie's down-to-earth humor. It's a little book, but there's a lot to think about in it. You have to respect the guy."
4,fun Willie Book,I bought this book for my dad for Father's day. It was a hit. He does like Willie so he was interested in it. He laughed out loud while reading it a few times.
3,I love Willie but this is weak,I bought this because I love Willie but I cant say I'm disappointed but then I didnt expect a lot. He is a fun loving guy who writes great music and entertains us. I saw him on Comedy Central with Jon Stewart and Jon asked him why he wrote it and he said 'because some guy asked me to'. That says it all
4,General advice on living a better life,"The Tao of Willie is a nice little book about how to live a happier life and be a better person. Willie Nelson gives examples of his own life and how he was not happy when he was being negative, but things changed when he changed his way of thinking. Willie also emphasizes how people should treat each other with respect. Short, easy to read chapters and overall a good book."
3,"If you like Willie Nelson, you'll like this book","Easy read, Simple words from a simple man, Willie Nelson. Lots of good advice for taking life easy. Makes a good gift."
5,Backstage with Willie,"I deployed to Afghanistan in May 2006. The morning of my departure, I received a phone call from both of the authors of this book. Willie and Turk wished me luck and a safe return on my journey. It was a memory that has been with me ever since. Just this past week, I had the fortune of getting to see Willie Nelson in concert (The Last of Breed Tour) for the first time in my 33 years. It was an amazing show and I also had the pleasure of meeting him backstage as he proceeded to the stage to perform with Merle Haggard and Ray Price. What an experience!While on deployment I was able to read this book. There is little happiness in Afghanistan these days. But every night prior to lights out, I could always count on a smile and a reflection of my life through the words in this book. It was a pleasure to read.To Willie and Turk...Thank you!"
4,Delightful,"I am a university professor and read many books, but I have not enjoyed a book this much for quite some time. It is a laugh out loud, down to earth book that brings one back to reality while having fun doing it. I put this book on my ""read once a year"" shelf, and sent copies to others. A quick read, and well worth it! Thanks for the good time, Willie."
5,Just Finished Reading It,"I just finished reading the Tao of Willie, and loved it. Loved it so much that I felt compelled to place my first customer review on Amazon.Basically, it is a great read. The body of the book is brilliant. Willie is very humorous and quite enlightening.Word of warning: If you read some bad reviews; and you still buy the book because you need to spend a few more bucks to get free shipping {on a different purchase}, but you find the title irrestible, so you buy it anyway. Then you get the book and are turned off by the introduction; and then you're wondering should I invest any more time into to this deal. Well, my advice is to keep reading. After you get past the introduction, the book is fantastic.I'll probably read it again. It did make my heart feel happier, and I suspect the second read might do the same. Thank you Willie!Respectfully,From an Okie Bean-Counter"
4,really pretty,This book is well made and any little princess will love to look at it over and over again.
4,This great classic needs to be remastered....disc messes up!,"I am with the other reviewers here, this classic is great...but the DVD messes up at about 1hr, 32min. into the movie. Universal needs to fix this problem, because this movie is great when you can see it in its original widescreen Techniscope aspect ratio (back when they made ""real"" widescreen movies). The video quality is ok for DVD-R, until the picture ""speeds up"" near the end. It's like it is time compressed for some reason? Who knows, who cares! Just fix the problem because I doubt this will ever be a ""legit"" pressing from Universal. These DVD-Rs are usually limited, so if you are a fan of this classic mystery, get it! Even with the mess up near the end, it is great to have a copy of this on widescreen DVD after all these years. They sure don't make movies like this anymore...Final score: Movie 5 stars, DVD 3 stars."
4,Worth playing,"This Spanish dvd is a superior, anamorphic-scope print of Curtis Harrington's cult thriller from the 60s. The print and magoptical mono soundtrack are highly indicative of the original theatrical release. The English-language audio option features optional Castilian subtitles (and there's also a Castilian dub).The film is a tidy, retro thriller made special by an insidious performance from the great Simone Signoret. Here she brings some diabolical Gallic flair into the household of a couple of brash Americans whose second-rate theatrics just aren't clever enough. There's a wonderful, trashy chic to the production design, and both Caan and Ross are charming as the young dupes.There's been no American dvd release in sight for this sweet little thriller, so this import DVD is the only way to go if you're multi-regional and need this minor gem in your collection."
5,Simply Amazing!,"What can I say about this stunningly beautiful woman with an equally stunningly beautiful voice, that hasn't already been said here? Her high notes in ""Silent Night"" were the purest I've ever heard!Her tears when she sang ""IF I Had My Way"" touched me.This disk will go with a select few others such as Les Miserables in concert and the Andrew Lloyd Webber celebration, as one of the best musical DVD's I have ever listened to! Linda Eder is the closest thing to a goddess I think we will see for a long time."
4,She's just GREAT!,"Yes, LeeAnn from CA - ""Do you hear what I hear"" with the African beat is wonderful. Plus, I defy anyone to listen to Linda sing ""Ava Maria"" or ""O Holy Night"" without getting goose-bumps! W - O - W !!!Linda Eder's voice is a wonder, so anything she sings is bound to be fabulous. I'm hoping for another Christmas album from this fantastic artist, with more creative arrangements similiar to ""Do you hear what I hear"" to truly showcase the glorious voice & talent of this lady."
5,"The ""Very Best"" Christmas Cd yet! :)","I could hardly wait for the Christmas season to officially begin so I could play this CD over and over again. Linda Eder by far, puts out the best music and has so much fun doing it. Her concerts are unbelievable and her fans just can't get enough of her music. I hope this Christmas CD is just a taste of what is to come. I don't want to sound greedy, but Linda, would you please make another Christmas CD for us? We Love You Linda! Please keep the music coming...we need Linda Eder music!Folks, purchase this wonderful CD. Treat yourself to the best ""VOICE"" of this lifetime!"
4,Entertaining contribution to Christmas music fare,"Linda Eder knows how to entertain on her CDs, and this one is no exception. Her husband Frank Wildhorn is greatly unappreciated, but his contributions (namely the GREAT song, ""The Bells of St. Paul) are welcome too. Bravo!"
1,"WHILST LOOKING FOR XMAS MUSIC, I","happened upon this site, and I am not buying this cd for one reason, the inclusion of The Little Drummer Boy. This piece has been recorded by everyone from the Chipmunks to the Harry Simeone Chorale to the Ray Coniff Singers to Emmy Lou Harris. C'mon! Do we need another version?? What a waste! Everyone has done it a unique way, there are no new arrangements left. The inclusion of this track tells me the producer was not using their imagination, which agrees with some of the other negative reviews. Sorry Linda, you may have a great voice, but no royalties from me this xmas!"
5,Music,Christmas Stays the Same is absolutely wonderful to listen all Christmas Season long. It's easy on the ears as well as the nerves so it can easily be enjoyed during a formal sit-down dinner as well as casual entertaining.
3,"If you like Linda, you want this. Otherwise....","Linda Eder is one of the great vocalists of our time. Unfortunately, her Christmas album is on the mediocre list. Sadly, someone on her team tries too hard to make her sound like a pop princess, and the background vocals and bands often get in the way of allowing the listener to really hear and enjoy Linda's amazing voice. (This is my complaint on many of her albums.)I agree with other reviewers that the new songs are ho-hum, and would add that her rendition of ""The Christmas Song"" is much too similar to Barbra Streisand's; however, there are some nice recordings here, too.Overall, if you like Linda Eder, you'll probably want this album. If you've never heard Linda before, try ""It's No Secret Anymore"" instead :)"
5,Buy this CD now!,"If you are a fan of Linda Eder, there is no doubt that you will love this collection of Christmas songs, sung only like she can. This is by far the best Christmas CD that I own. It includes the classics as well as a few new songs. There is no better way to get into the Christmas spirit than to listen to this CD. Even those who aren't familiar with the beautiful voice of Linda Eder will find this CD to be a keeper. Enjoy!"
3,Mildly Interesting,"""Extreme Gadgets"" begins by following the evolution of surfboards, starting with the second century in Hawaii. Royalty had boards up to 26 feet long and 150 lbs. The 20th century saw a rapid pace of change - 1930s brought hollow boards, 1935 the addition of a stabilizer fin front and rear, in the 1950s came lighter polyurethane boards. Then came ""air boards"" that actually rose out of the water.Most of the rest of the disc consists of showing how skateboads, snowboards, mountain-boards, wakeboards, and sky-surfing boards had evolved from the basic surfboard. Unfortunately, the story quickly became obvious and it was difficult to maintain interest.The one segment that did not derive from surfboards involved mountain bikes. However, this segment had little detail, and again was fairly obvious."
5,Teen Rights Expert Praises ACLU Family Legal Guide,"Adults and teens interested in their legal rights as family members will discover in this fine book that the ACLU is truly interested in their personal welfare, and that it wants to educate them on their rights both as American citizens and as family members. The book is nonpartisan. All ACLU books relating to civil rights are first rate and very satisfying to read. Martin Guggenheim, the author of this work, is a national figure in the area of civil rights law. After consulting this work - in Q&A format - consider reading other ACLU books for invaluable information about American civil rights law."
5,"One terrific voice, One terrific CD","Laura where are you??????. We should be listening to you all the time. This is one fabulous CD for any jazz lover. The music runs through me and makes me ecstatic. You belong up there with the best of them. Would luv to see this fab lady in concert. Laura thank you, thank you, thank you."
2,Not enough!,"This DVD has great videos of various stretches of Hadrian's Wall; well done and pleasant to look at. It also has very, very good, introductory material. This could have been a great video on the Wall. However, at only 10 minutes, one wonders why the producers even bothered. Perhaps it was meant to be shown in a visitors' center. It might have been OK for that. But for a home video, there simply is not enough material to make it worth the while. And, at over $10, the value just isn't there. Look into the various other videos on Hadrian's Wall."
4,Good book,"It is a great book for parents or educators working with a deaf child. However, I wish there were a book for educators working with a deaf parent whose children are not hearing impaired."
2,Shocked,"At first I loved it, but leaving it in the pond under the sun for only one week made it crack up"
2,Don't Believe You!,"This cd may say that,that they are the Original Artist,But it doesn't say ANYTHING about the original radio recordings so in short till more information comes out about it,i'd say it's gonna be ANOTHER lemon----class reunion stuff,(GARBAGE) NOT worth the gamble till the producer levels the playing field,and let's us know that this isn't another one of those GOT'CHA's.. I know i won't be wasting my money to find out.."
1,Not Bad,"I would say: not bad. But so far! Where are the deep effects of the Schubert's music? Where is the feeling of this music? It's not bad for a first CD, but I don't know if I would buy the next one!"
3,An elusive look at an elusive life.,"The book is loaded with facts about Ms. Fitzgerald's concert and recording careers, but gives almost nothing about her personal life."
5,Best of the Bios,"This is the best of the Ella bios. Authoritative, well-written, and insightful with a helpful discography. Avoid the much inferior ""First Lady of Song"" by Fidelman. THIS is the bio to buy."
1,Dumb Book,"I can only write about my few years with her - but I certainly have more insight about the woman not so much the singer than this whole dumb book.Lots about recording - of course he was not there - and nothing about her other than ""and then she did""..."
1,Terrible product,I bought this for nursing school and it doesn't work very well. When I let it out it doesn't fall freely. It is impossible to take a correct blood pressure using this. I will not be purchasing another one.
2,Gauge isn't calibrated properly.,"Bought this because it was from Prestige and figured it would at least work fine. However it was shipped with the gauge wrong. It is set higher than the 0 mark. Even though it is not a lot higher than the 0 mark, it still renders the BP wrong. Expected more from Prestige. Even though it says free recalibrating, the shipping cost makes it not worth it. Figured it would require recalibrating like maybe after a year or so but not right when it gets shipped. Very disappointed"
5,Awesome item!,"I bought this item not only because it is purple and purple is my favorite color, but because the reviews on it were so good. I know a lot of BP cuffs are alike and there isn't on thing that really makes one stand out better than the others, however, with this one, you can put your stethoscope in the pouch along with the BP cuff! I LOVE that. My other one wouldn't allow that. This one also has a front pocket to put little things in too. I love the color as it's a bit on the ""shiny"" side...silly, i know, but it's the little things that make me happy :-)"
3,CONTAINS LATEX,"I received this product in a timely fashion, (Prestige Aneroid Sphygmomanometer - Hunter Green). Product looked of good quality, but I couldn't use it because it contains latex! Amazon's listing does not indicate anywhere that this product contains natural latex - and I am deathly allergic to it. It wasn't until I received it in its product box that the presence of latex was indicated on the package. I find it strange that any modern medical equipment of this importance, and to be used on possibly several people, would contain latex, as most medical products are now being made latex-free. Just thought the buyer should know!"
3,Can't handle frequent professional use,"The price is great, but professionals beware. It can't stand up to multiple daily use. I've only had it five months - the tubing doesn't fit well on the bulb and it continually pops off and I have to search the bottom of my nursing bag for it and it is no longer in calibration. Won't be buying this one again."
1,stopped working after only a short time,"The blood pressure cuff worked fine when I first received it. After about a dozen uses, though, The dial on the gauge would no longer move. The cuff still expands, but no dial movement - very frustrating. Would NOT recommend."
4,Blood Pressure Cuff,"Product as described and delivered early. Using this with stethoscope in my EMR med bag. Helping with medical screening at the town hall and wanted my own equipment to go in my EMR med kit. Took a little practice to feel comfortable with it, but it seems to be a great product."
4,Professional blood pressure montior,"I bought it for myself. It is very pretty and compact, portable. With the stethscope, could accurately record your blood systolic and diastolic pressure. The only disadvantage is I need my husband to help me put on cuff and stethscope... Give my kids around, we barely can get it work. I will recommend it to more professional people in medicine. If you want to use it at home, better choose automatic inflation and digital one."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased this in December 2010 and after just 2 years, it no longer works. The rubber balloon inside the arm cuff has fine holes in it causing it to lose air.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was it worked fine initially and I love the color. I won't be buying a prestige product again----live and learn."
4,Bought as a gift - packaging was a bit damage en route,Item was purchased as a gift so I have not used it. The item looks as described and has been reported to work well. The packaging is a very thin plastic box container and was fairly damaged en route with delivery when I received it but the item seems to be fine.
4,Excellent cuff for the field!,This is an excellent cuff for the field. It has an artery indicator on the cuff to save time during triage/treatment and size range index to know if it's a proper fit. Pair it with a Littmann and you're set. Just one note: IT IS NOT LATEX-FREE!
4,Used this cuff through nursing school and now on the job,"I purchased this purple BP cuff while I was a student in nursing school so I could practice doing blood pressures on my own before I went to any actual clinical settings. This particular cuff has proven to be both accurate and reliable. Now that I'm a nurse, I use my purple cuff when I can't use my Panasonic digital wrist blood pressure cuff. Many digital wrist BP cuffs require the patient to bring his or her wrist to heart level AND stay quite still for an accurate reading. A digital wrist BP cuff, although usually VERY convenient, just doesn't always work as well on patients with Parkinsons, Alzheimers, gigantic wrists ect... Just be sure to put your name on your new BP cuff, or your coworkers/classmates may grab it since it is such a sweet color!"
1,Angus,out of the box the calibration is out of specificationfrom where I am it will cost more to send it backNOT impressed at all
1,It is broken already in less than a month,"I bought this in August 2011. It worked great at the beginning. Then one day it just stopped working. I am not sure what happen, but I wouldn't buy this again."
3,No atendeu minhas expectativas,"Acreditei que fosse um produto melhor do que o demonstrado na propaganda. Funcionou bem, mas no me agradou. No achei de boa qualidade"
5,Pilot Headlamp Harness Relay,Good Product! Just make sure to insulate the bottom of the relay from moisture by using electrical tape or shrink wrap.
3,The end of season 19,"I should start be saying that for me the show began to go off kilter a bit during the JNT era. However, I really still like Peter Davison's first season but this one is the worst of them. It isn't really a bad story but it feels like a missed oppertunity which unfortunately would mark a bit of the JNT era. This is one of those episodes that you sit around, watch and can't really why you don't care more for it. I hadn't seen it in years and then I preordered it before it was released about a year ago. My thought was that it probably wasn't as bad as I had remembered and sat down prepared to give it a chance. The problem is that after watching it again, I haven't pulled it out since."
3,Not the best of Davison,"When I bought this video, I was looking forward to viewing it. But, when I was finished, I was sorely disappointed.Although this episode includes some wonderful footage of Heathrow Airport and a cunning idea of having concords disappear to the Jurassic period, it lacks a sense of adventure and excitement.If you are one who just got into Doctor Who, I suggest buying ""Castrovalva"" or ""Earthshock"" before purchasing this video. Otherwise, if you are a die-hard fan of Doctor Who, go ahead and buy this video. Perhaps you'll like it more than I did."
3,too big,it's too big. take up a lot fo room but has lasted is dishwasher safe and hasn't melted like the former silicone one i had.
5,replacement,"Looked everywhere for a replacement spoon rest after my wife's ceramic one took a ""dive"" while I was ""cooking"" on the stove. She loved this one, and the money I would have saved in gas alone would have paid for it."
5,Handsome Spoon Rest,Very handsome looking spoon rest. The shiny stainless steel looks polished in our kitchen. We throw it in the dishwasher every few days to keep it looking sparking. Very happy with this purchase.
4,Suprise Twist,"I bought this gift for my mother and sister for their Christmas present. My sister opened gave a confused look and laughed, it looked like a ""titanium buttocks."" It was the joke of the day. Otherwise my mother and sister love it, no more mess on the counter top."
3,Probably better options out there...,"First- you have to get over that it looks like a butt. When it's flipped over drying on our counter, my son always picks it up and parades around with it saying that it's a monkey butt. Not high design... As to the usefulness of the product- well, it holds spoons just fine and utensils as well. I wish that the end didn't taper in though. It makes it tricky to place two utensils on it. I wouldn't buy it again, but it works okay."
4,Just an average spoon holder.,"Nothing fancy about it, but it gets the job done. Not 5 stars since it's not the prettiest thing around, but it works. Only had for a week or so and used a few times already. Been through the dishwasher just fine."
3,Just ok.,"After reading all the great reviews, I purchased this last week and had high expectations. There is nothing wrong with the item, but it's certainly not as great as what most of the reviews say. While it does hold two utensils, it appears to be made to hold two standard size utensils (i.e, fork, table spoon . . ) and not two large utensils (i.e., a ladle and wooden spoon . . ) which is what I was looking for. I'll probably give this to one of my nieces, and continue looking for something that will better accomodate two large cooking/serving utensils."
4,BIG,the spoon rest is very big. fits all sizes of spoons. the material is thin but maybe that's why it's so large. i use it every day and enjoy it. hope to get one for my daughter.
3,Love it!,Now I don't have to worry about it breaking. I have had so many spoon rests that broke. It also saves space and cleans easy.
2,Don't Like!,I was looking for a better quality of Stainless Steel. No i would not recommend this item to anyone at the cost you offer.
2,Looks like truck nuts....Gross!,"I just can not get over the fact that it looks like stainless testicles! My husband threw away the packaging or I would have sent it right back...as it is not with the effort, I am just ordering a replacement."
3,spoon rest,When I received this product and actually saw it in person. I thinking it was a little overpriced. If I known it was this thin and fragile I would not have ordered it.
3,Might scratch a cooktop,"I thought this looked nice on the website, it seems like its is well made. It may scratch your cooktop if your not careful. I'm not going to lie, this spoon rest resembles something..."
3,"okay, but too short","Looks good, washes well. But too short for my long spoons and cooking utensils - because of the weight of the handles, the utensils have to be placed at an angle where the handle meets the base of the spoon - not ideal, the utensils sit awkwardly. I should have known better from looking at the photos. If you're using utensils with regular length handles, it's fine."
3,"Interesting, but not solid","This book has been billed as representing the significant results of an extensive research project. In actuality, the author presents a clearly explained list of practical suggestions for professors and advisors to use when trying to improve the quality of students' college experience. These suggestions are compelling, in large part because of how Light presents them. However, as research, Light's book is weak. The book gives little explanation of his research design, Light does not share is data collection instruments, and he gives no information about his method of data analysis or the results. Consequently, the reader cannot determine whether Light's list of suggestions is based on sound research methods or whether he assembled a list of suggestions based on some interesting things he heard some students say. The difference between these two is critical to the validity and reliability of his claims."
5,perfect condition,"book looked brand new, and I must have paid less than $5 for it. I would highly recommend buying books from this dealer again."
2,Pretentious,"It should have been titled, Making the Most of Harvard: Students Speak Their Minds. We were required to read this book for an English writing class. Some of the suggestions in the book are helpful, like time management and getting help if you are not scoring well but only if you read this book *before* you go to college.Light makes suggestions that may not be feasable, including finding a class with very few students because it will be benificial. Our class also felt that Light's suggestion of picking roomates according to race is ludicrous."
1,way to long,they did not answer my e-mail it took almost 3 weeks to mail it it should have taken 4 days tops
4,"Fresh, Hip, and WICKED FUN","Okay, I love BattleFlag. That was my bad mood song. I used to blast it loud enough to shake the walls of my room. This CD is the bomb. Lo Fi Stars are fresh, hip, and sound like Jamiroquai on heavy drugs. Awesome. I am a pure Trance addict, so this was a bit of exploration but it payed off. I love this CD. I'm not a great fan of the ""Rage Against the MAchine"" and the ""Kill the Government"" style lyrics, but this awesome stuff. But it is not techno. it is urban. very different stuff people. if you are looking for another ATB get the party going group, look at TranceNation or Gatecrasher. If you just want some good bass poundin' fun, buy this."
3,Very eclectic but somewhat uneven,"Of course this is eclectic; how many other mixes can you name with Blackstreet, Boogie Down Productions, Les Rythmes Digitales, Armand Van Helden, and Prodigy? The Lo-Fidelity All Stars decided to ignore traditional mixing concepts like staying in one genre or matching beats. When it works, it's a lot of fun - it's as diverse and entertaining as you could hope for. However, the set is slow to get started (not even really kicking off until track 9) and sometimes the disregard to flow can be too much. For example, Prodigy's ""Out Of Space"" isn't even really mixed in and feels like an afterthought rather than the climax they surely wanted it to be. And why is this album stickered? Is there even any profanity?Oh well. It's not stellar (if you want a truly outrageous but eclectic mix, try ""the Dirtchamber Sessions"" by Prodigy or Fatboy Slim's entry in this series) but it has its moments."
1,"extremely weak, even if you're a fan of Lo Fidelity Allstars","I purchased both of the LFA's main 2 albums, ""How To Operate With A Blown Mind"" and ""Don't Be Afraid Of Love"" (Don't Be Afraid of Love is the better of the two hands down, much more skillful sampling) and enjoyed them a lot, but when I bought this one for [...] bucks it was [...] bucks not well-spent. There are no good songs on here for goodness sake, except for the one by The Prodigy which they didn't mix at all; it sounds exactly the same on the CD that it is derived from (""Experiences"", highly recommended). I was very disappointed, because like other reviewers have said the Fatboy Slim version of ""On the Floor At the Boutique"" is extremely good, but the LFA attempt at it is awful. Fatboy's version is very cool and turntablist, but this one is just boring. Don't buy it, it's not necessarily similar to their albums."
2,Wasted my money. Don't expect Fatboy slim stuff here,My favorite techno CD is On the floor at the boutique by Fatboy Slim so I decided to buy this CD. Worst mistake I ever made. This CD is not like the fbs one and its not techno at all. its all stupid oldskool rap or whatever you call it and the only reason i give it 2 stars is for no diggity. buy the fbs one instead.
5,One of the best ways to ruin your social life,"Looking for a way to spend the long, dreary winter nights? DK2 is guaranteed to keep you up until the wee hours of the morning. Wonderful graphics, a fairly easy user interface and a sick sense of humour make this offering a sure winner. Be prepared to devote the next 40 hours of your life to mastering this."
4,"Evil is good, well maybe ok.","Like it's predecessor Dungeon Keeper, you once again enter a world where you are the evil mastermind and face down the minions of good and rival keepers. On the plus side this game has a much better AI, room building is a snap compared to the original, and multiplayer mode actually works. On the down side though, one of the best things about DK I was that all the creatures were useful. Many of the monsters in DK II have limited use (such as warlocks after all the research is done with). A consistantly winning strategy is to possess a high level (8-10) Dark Angel and trash your opponents Dungeon Heart. These are minor problems though, and overall DK II is a fine game. I am looking forward to the next instalment in the series."
1,Dungeon Keeper 2,"Would not work.When it was put in the computer, the screen was black.Too much trouble to send it back."
5,Doesn't work under XP,"Great game, when it works. It needs to be run in compatibility mode and the 1.7 patch available for the game does not run under this CD. It needs an original CD, not the re-release from EA. Paid 44 bucks for a game that crashes every few minutes."
1,Please do not buy this if you are looking for some hands own,This CD doesn't contain the Virtual PC. If you are looking for some hands-own please do not buy this. Pilothouse consulting send me a mail that they are not supporting the Virtual PC for this CD !!Please do not waste your money
5,The most Informational Training Available,"This is a MUST reference tool for any SharePoint 2003 Administrator, when you need to refer to how and what to do in any given situtation that you don't deal with day-to-day!"
1,Don't Buy,These things are made out of rubber and there for act as a lubricant. Using these increase the chance of throwing the remote.
1,Using your money to light a cigarette would be more useful,"This is definitely the absolute worst CD I have ever purchased in my life aside from the fact that I couldnt rip it to my computer so I could add it to my playlists. The range of songs on this CD is mindboggling in terms of their disparity. The ones that are actually worth giving a listen to are so banal they are pretty much dime a dozen on CD's like this. This is not the first chillout CD I have ever purchased so I wasn't caught off guard or anything like that. It's just very, very, very bad music."
5,"Pure, clean, and enticing","If you love Bossa Nova, Samba, or any of the South American genres, you are sure to love Rio Bahia. The music is clean and elegant. It is complex without being at all tedious or assuming. This is a must for your personal Christmas list!"
2,Unfulfilled expectation,"I was quite impressed with the previous review of this item and reviews for similar lunch jars by the same company. After a suspenseful week of waiting, my lunch jar finally arrived. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. I downloaded the English product manual from Zojirushi's website and the followed directions. I heated up the lunch jar and the food containers with boiling water at about 8 am, dumped the water, dried everything with a towel, and filled the food containers with hot food. By the time I sad down for lunch at 12:15 my food was only lukewarm, and after having the food container open for about 5 minutes, everything was dead cold. I expected my food to keep much warmer after a few hours than it did.I would not recommend use of this particular jar if you intend to keep your food warm for more than about 3 hours."
3,Okay for any fan of the movie,"This item was purchased as a ""gag-gift"" and arrived as described. Basically a goofy sculpt of an equally goofy actor that says extremely goofy things. This isn't a child's toy, as the movie isn't rated for children, and has no ""play value"" since the statue can't be removed from the base."
1,This game BLOWS!,"This game was entirely impossible for me to play because of the menus...as the Amazon review says, it's impossible to navigate... the game has this automatic movement in all the selection processes. You have to fight automatic computer movements to make your selections. Example- in the settings screen there's four options... difficulty, quarter length, style of play, and tutorial. Well, I would set it to Pro, 10 minutes, normal, and off, then the game would auto change one of the selections a second before I hit enter- so I had to start all over. It was IMPOSSIBLE! I could not even play a season because of it...it's awful.I hope 2001 isn't like this."
4,Exceptional Game-play; aggrivating navigation,"The game play and graphics of this game are incredible, but navigating through the menus, especially in the franchise mode, are a bit unnerving. The unreality of a 2-13 team beating a 15-0 team in the last week of the season tend to be aggrivating."
4,Fun Time Waster,"This game is fairly easy to pick up. You can hop on it when u have a few minutes to waste and hop right off. It's very... amusing. It's not very deep, but that is 1/2 the charm. Relaxing way to waste some time. It does take a long time to load."
2,A Poor Soul,"There is no doubt that Edwards has a fine set of pipes. I have heard him perform live many times, and when he's on, he's wonderful. This album is poorly programmed and overlooks Edwards' ability to swing. This set presents him as a poor soul bumbling through life. Though not inappropriate, I prefer the fun-loving, swinging Edwards working with his long-time pianist, the masterful Gary Pace."
1,Broken disc,The disc was broken and I have not received a new one. So....F-. I have never had a problem with EBay. I have had several with amazon.
5,Los acompa√±amientos del karaoke estan muy bien!,Vale la pena por el precio tiene muy buenascanciones y Los arreglos estan increibles
1,Whooo! The Awful-liciousness!,"I love seeing Black actors get work. That rocks! However, that didn't mitigate the tired and poor script, fake fights, and low-budget production values.This movie steals from ""Jason's Lyric,"" ""Bluehill Avenue,"" ""Menace II Society,"" and so much more. Why make a film if it's going to be not only unoriginal, but worse than the original films?I only saw this to see mega-hottie Chino XL, but he's barely in it. And you never see him shirtless! Critics took Eddie Griffin's ""Foolish"" to task for only giving roles to light-skinned women. This movie too implies that only light-skinned sisters can be beautiful. It unfairly implies that it's okay for brothers to come in all complexions, but not sisters. Just shameless!I just think anyone with taste and a background in films will simply hate, hate, hate this piece of garbage."
3,"Unoriginal, but still entertaining","This film is not the most original thing out there, but its not flat-out terrible either. The acting is good, the cinematography is actually quite good also - the storyline, however, is rehash. The whole ""drug dealer wanting to turn a new leaf but can't get out"" is a tired, tired almost cliched premise at this point, along with the ""crooked cops."" Stock characters like the ""good girlfriend"" that wants Cesar to get out the ""dope game"" and go straight is also cliche.The tracks(audio) with the movie are actually pretty decent also. What kills the movie is that its been told so many times. It's decent movie- won't blow your mind, and won't have you ejecting it 10 minutes into it either."
2,Nothing Like the Picture,"The one I got looks nothing like the one in the picture. The shape of the ""Ashes of Problem Students"" label part is a different shape and has a different word configuration, but that isn't the worst part. The worst part is that the cork is too small for the opening, so when it arrived, the cork was jammed in there so far I had to pry it out with a knife, damaging the cork. The cork itself is lower quality than the one in the picture. Looking at the picture, the problem is probably the opening of the top being too large on the one I got.These are not the home-fired quality goods they look like on Amazon. They are made in China, and quality is not uniform. You would think for this price, and with what you pay for shipping, you would get a better product."
4,...a very entertaining pop musical,"This musical is an original--before the movie ""You've Got Mail!"" and far more creative."
5,I highly recommend LOVE ONLINE!,The music beautifully captures the emotional roller coaster of this modern-day love story. Brian Gari is brilliant and sensitive. I can't seem to get enough of him.
5,Excellent. Could be on Broadway,Who is Brian Grari and why haven't we heard of him before? The melodies are charming and original and the lyrics carry the story nicely. This could certainly be a hit Broadway (or at least Off-Broadway) show in the near future if Mr. Gari can get it to a producer who can see its potential. Let's hear more from this very talented oomposer.
3,Healthy right out of the box,"The plant came as expected, with several stalks and plenty of leaves.My cat did not seem very interested in it. The plant also requires a lot of water to keep it green. I forgot to water it for awhile and some of the stalks dried up and died. My cat actually liked the dead leaves better, but I don't think he is really attracted to cat nip anyway. The other stalks are still growing. You might want to consider using the plant to dry out your own home made cat nip. Altogether, a nice looking healthy plant for your home, whether your cat likes it or not."
1,Catnip Plant,Two weeks after the company contacted me that they were going to start growing the catnip that very evening they cancelled the order. Sure am glad the economy is so good that Hirt's Gardens can cancel orders.
5,Catnip plant,"This plant came to me in excellent condition, and has thrived beautifully. My 3 cats adore it and I keep it indoors for them. I am sure if I need more plants, I will order from this seller. It came in a very timely manner and in excellent condition, not dried out at all."
5,hats off to Dean,"Dean Bradley needs to be commended for taking on the challenge of resorting and reorganizing Thoreau's lost manuscript, for if he had not we would not have the beautiful language of Thoreau to savor once again. With this manuscript we see Thoreau as he meanders through his beloved Walden Pond area and we learn of his intellect as he quotes from the ancient authors as well as his contemporaries. The descriptions soothe one on a stressful day and once again make us see just how great a writer Thoreau was. Hats off to Dean Bradley for his work!"
5,Wild at Heart,"Do we have a preference for our Thoreau? ABSOLUTELY! But even the adulterated varietal will do in a pinch. The long lost diary of HD's romps in the woods serve well to remind us why some fruits are forbidden. Thoreau's posthumously edited musings over cattails, gladiolas, and other seductive succulents put the reader in the mood, apparently, for wanton strolls in a wooded glen savoring everything from unbridalled grapes (of wrath?) to the odd jack-in-the-pulpit. 'Tis better to give than to receive and this new work by an old friend makes a great gift when you want it known that you are in the mood for fruit more private than Publix."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BUMPER STICKER...,"As a cat lover, I find this bumper sticker offensive. Moreover, all it takes is one really sick individual on the road to think that this would actually be a fun thing to do, just to see what happens, causing some poor, defenseless cat untold suffering, leading to its death.Some people do not need to have any more bad ideas put into their heads. There are some really evil people out there who are always looking for something diabolical to do. Do not give them any more bad ideas. Avoid this bumper sticker, as you would the plague."
2,Silly,"Lanning is a pretty good writer, and his summaries of these 100 engagements are capably done. However, an historian Lanning is NOT, and it certainly does show in his interpretive work in this book. First and foremost, can anyone really say what the #1 battle in world history was in terms of importance? Of course not! Lanning tries to do so but it seems the more he tries and goes down his list (and why stop at 100?), the sillier this book becomes. Is Yorktown really the #1 most important battle in military history? No! In fact, it wasn't even the most important in the American Revolution, but don't tell that to Lanning. The book is written from an American-centric perspective, not from a world history perspective. This is why he ranks San Jacinto as #23, but the battle that kicked France out of Canada, made Britain the world super power of the second half of the 18th century, and set the stage for American independence (Quebec) is #29. San Jacinto?!?! Please!"
4,Soundtrack for a Beautiful Apocalypse,"I found this cd under 'Misc. G' at a record store in my area. I was looking for something else but this caught my eye. Seemed like interesting stuff. After listening, I can say that my intuition was right this time. This is a fine piece of work. I hoped to find other selections by this artist but no such luck. These elegant, dark instrumentals will have to do for now. The occasional use of voice adds to the music well and clarifies the messages here. And, I love the use of percussive effects. The subtitle to this is ""songs from the unrealized film script"" -- makes me wonder what that film would have been like to watch."
2,Disappointing lack of useful information,"On the surface of it, this book seemed to cover what I was looking for, but it only took me 5 min after receiving it to realize that it would not be very useful. The format is chatty and rather uninformative and states mostly the obvious, like the fact that you can make money by selling prints, or pictures on the internet, but without much actual information on how to do so. The book does contain a lot of nice pictures (presumably by the author), but the print quality is actually surprisingly poor for a photography book."
4,Great book with general information,"This is a great book for the beginning photographer or for the intermediate taking the next step to improve their photos, expand their equipment and knowledge. It gives you a general overview of the thought process you need to have if you expect to take good photos. It explains everything in layman terms so that you don't get jumbled up with technical detail. This is by no means a technical book, it is a good companion book to other books that will give you the technical knowledge you need to help you make those great shots. It is a book more on the art form of taking good photos. Also this book has lots of great color photos so that you can see what the author is talking about on the end result of a photo following general rules of photography. I would have liked to see the technical aspects listed under each/most of the photos to help photographers with getting those shots as well as the location of some of the really great scenic shots."
2,Jessica Simpson's version still better,"I have to say that Jessica's Simpson version of this song is much better even though I love Rosie's voice. I think her other song Blink is much better. This is much different than Jessica Simpson's version and has a good overall sound, but after hearing Jessica Simpson's song this one does not compare. I think if you've never heard the other version you wouldn't find any problems with this song."
4,under counter can opener,this is a great item. it was easy to install and is a great space saver. easy to open larger cans too.
3,Under counter can opener,Difficult to mount. Works well. Price reasonable. Not much of a selection to choose from. Not many manufacturers make these.
4,Can opener,Difficult item to find in stores. It works really well. Was told they didn't make it anymore. Fits under the counter well.
4,Black Decker Spacemaker Can Opener,Appears to do what is is designed to do. Some problems in installing under cabinets with a 1 inch overhang in front. Needs additional spacers to fit properly.
1,It's a piece of junk,This has to be the worst small applicance I ever bought. The cutting blade leaves a uneven jaggered edge along the top. Better throw in back can before putting in the trash. It's hard to lock the can in the blade mechanism and also hard to release it from the opener after use. Next time I'll go buy a manual can opener. B & D really managed to put their name of this Chinese piece of junk.
3,not bad,"Works very well. installation was a bit tricky, but no problems. wish it had a better knife sharpener. overall it is a great value."
2,D&D CO85,"This product work fairly well, but it is not like the B&D; EC85 that I also have.I was mislead by the web page from [...]. We have corrected the problem as I have indicated in my E-Mail to Amazon.Tank you,Joseph V. Barravecchio"
1,uselessness perfected,"We bought this Black and Decker CO85 can opener about a year ago at Shopko. It didn't work in the space we wanted, and I had to make spacers to provide the clearance needed above the body. It's an utter bust when it comes to opening cans. When it doesn't drop the can in the middle of the job, you have to help it turn the can to avoid stalling. I imagine it might actually work if they had used a cutter wheel instead of that knife. Actually the dinky little 75 cent manual unit in our junk drawer outperforms it in both speed and convenience. I can't understand B & D selling a product so certain to drive purchasers away from their brand. The only use I've been able to figure for it is to make a gift of one to people you really, really want to annoy.Unhappy in Nebraska,Ardel"
1,unhappy camper,"I bought this model July 2008 to replace a different brand that wore out after 10 years. I have to agree, its very hard to get it to work because the handle doesnt raise high enough to allow for certian can sizes. After just 7 months the part with the magnet that actually holds the can, broke off with no way to reattach it. I will never buy this make again."
1,Piece of junk,"DO NOT BUY THIS, unless it's a gift for someone you hate. This is the absolute worst electric can opener I have experienced over the past four decades. On rare occasions it actually works like a can opener should. But most of the time it stalls and drops shavings of the can and the label all over the place. Sometimes it drops the can on the counter. What a mess!"
3,can opener,I wanted one that went under the counter but like the way this one hooks onto the can real well.
1,DO NOT BUY,"It works GREAT for about 3 months then just stops working. Amazon will not return it, so avoid buying from here. WORST product ever! MAGNET of all things does not work anymore which is crazy. Black and Decker used to be one of the best but I will never buy kitchen gadgets from them again. VERY unreliable and don't waste your money!!"
3,Good product,"The product was a good value, however, it was larger than the one I had before and my husband had to make it work in the spot where my old one was mounted."
1,This Black & Decker can opener worked fine for two weeks,"This Black & Decker can opener was a Christmas gift from my daughter. After taking the time and trouble to drill holes and mount it under the kitchen cabinet, it looked nice but DIED after just two weeks. What a nuissance to remove the thing and send it back to Amazon. Black & Decker used to be the best, not so much anymore.No more Black & Decker products in this house ever again!"
4,A good value,"A bit underpowered, but nevertheless a good and reliable machine. It works well every time, and the value is certainly there."
4,can opener,Product shipped was as it was describes. very easy to install and use. Very happy with purchase. Absolutely love it
1,DOA,The small gear wheel wouldn't turn the can and actually fell off. Never opened the first can. Returned for credit
2,B&D review,"I have had the Black and Decker under the counter opener for about 3 years. My biggest problem, other than the fact that it takes forever to open a can because it keeps stalling, but when the can is open, all the liquid goes all over the place. I don't know if other people have had the same problem or if I am doing something wrong (but really, how can you do something wrong). I would like to replace it with another under the counter can opener but am afraid that they all will do the same thing and throw the liquids everywhere. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,bad deal from amazon,"Can opener is defective.It will not open any can, especially larger cans.I've tried everything so am sending it back to Black and Decker."
2,Not Reliable,"I have had this can opener for about 4 years. It works, but not all the time. Sometimes it decides it doesn't want to hold the can. Other times it will not cut. I would not buy this can opener"
2,A little disappointed,I bought this can opener to replace an old Black & Decker Opener. I was disappointed that the screw holes were spaced different than the old one. That meant I had to drill additional holes in my cabinet.
5,Great gift,Very happy with the purchase and quick shipping!!! It was a gift for my sister...to replace the old Black & Decker Spacemaker she had!!! Looks a lot better...the old one still worked with some manipulation.....so decided to replace it for her.....she loved it!!! We have one too and just love it!!!!
3,Under cabinet opener,This was the only under the cabinet can opener we could find. My husband hates this because it keeps dropping the cans. I just hold the can underneath but he wants something else.
3,Spacemaker can opener,"I had one before,I liked it and decided to try again. However this one doesn't work as well as the other when it was new. For some reason it is harder to open the can with the electric one than a hand one."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,"Do Not Buy , A great idea (under the Cabinet) to save counter space but it just will not open any can's, if you do get it to work, I can use a screw driver and hammer faster"
3,Works but only last about 2 years,"I bought this and it works okay and is out of the way.However every 18 months to 2 years the rivet that holds the magnet breaks.If you like it, keep the parts because sometimes the blade wears out before the rivetfor the magnet breaks and you can use the parts to fix your next one.The removable cutter/magnet assembly is not available any longer and was too expensive anyway.So I have replaced the first unit with the second unit and then the second unit with the third unit...Now the third is broken do I replace it a fourth time?I just don't know.Why doesn't anyone else make these things."
1,Piece of Junk,"After using this thing for at least a year, I am getting ready to remove it and throw it away. It simply won't open cans. It is very hard to get it started, and once started even harder to keep it going to completely cut the lid. Also, cans with lots of liquid in them will have juices strewn everywhere while it attempts to cut the lids. What a mess! I had an old GE Spacemaker years ago that worked like a dream, but this ""Spacemaker"" is no relative or close kin. It was extremely frustrating at Thanksgiving trying to open many cans. I'll be going back to a regular countertop model, unfortunately, before Christmas."
1,Waste of money,"Great idea, but poor product. My parents have a B&D spacemaker from years ago and it still is in perfect condition and runs like a champ. I got this one and it died within the 1st month. It sounded like it was going to die everytime and after awhile it wouldn't even hold the can up long enough to open it. A lot of times once it was done opening the can (if it ever got that far), it would drop the can....made a mess most times. I am going on ebay to see if I can find the version that my parents have. Otherwise it's back to old style. Very disappointed in this can opener."
2,Crappy,"This can opener doesn't always work, you have to play with the can in order for it to work properly. It is a hassel more times than not you have to use hand opener. I bought this as a gift for my parents to help them and will now have to purchase another one..."
5,Black and Decker Spacemaker Can Opener,I have had a similar can opener previously that finally bit the dust. My kids actually bought the same brand but a different model which closed up to hide the can opener. That would not have worked with our space so I had them return it and I purchased this one. I am very happy with the size and operation of this one. Would buy a Black and Decker brand again.
5,great!,"I had the same can opener for years ! mine broke so I got the same one again because it is the best ! this one is very quiet, hold the can perfectly, easy to clean and does not take space, awesome!"
3,Questionable quality,"I actually bought a second one only bcs I have the holes already drilled in my cabinet and wanted an easy replacement. But, the first one broke after a few years. It seems like it should last longer than that."
3,adequate,"It works, it's noisier than previous can opener that I paid $9.99 for 14 years ago. Lining up top of can to blade doesn't fall readily to hand."
1,"quick service, reasonable price, terrible product","I cleaned up my old Black and Decker opener and am using it again. The new opener is hard to use. You have to tilt the can to open it & it is awkward, then when it opens it spills the liquid in the can because it is tilted to remove also. It is definitely not an improvement (being new) over the old one I have, which is probably 20 years old. New is not always ""better"". I'll stick with the old."
4,Features,The unit accepts different size cans. It is not always easy to position can for start of cut. It cuts cleanly and evenly.It is powerful enough to cut all cans that have been tried.
1,Buyer Beware,"While we loved the original version of Black and Decker's Spacemaker Can Opener, please beware that this model is NOT the same as the one they sold for so many years. It will not fit in the same holes you've drilled into your cabinet (why would they do that?) but most importantly, this can opener does not work well at all. It continually stops in the process, leaving you with wrestling the can out of the opener and having to start over. There's something wrong with the design and operation of this. I called the warranty service and they sent me a new blade component but it made no difference. The can opener still does not work. Very frustrating and very disappointing. Time to go back to the old reliable hand can opener."
4,Can Opener,White plastic Spacers are to floppy to use as pattern for drilling Holes to put the Canopener under cabinet. BLACK & DECKER. My old one was easier to install.
4,"Best product, best price","I purchased this can opener to replace an earlier model that died after 15 years. Since this replaced an earlier B&D I figured I could use the existing holes and just unscrew the old one and install the new one. Wrong. The holes need to be farther apart. So I did have to drill new holes, no problem. Then I couldn't get the final screw to grab, figured that I had the holes drilled unevenly. After checking further I found that one screw supplied with the opener was not threaded properly. Had to wait until the next AM and go to the hardware store and buy screws. Screws that came with the opener are 10-32, 2.5 in., hardware store had only 10-32, 3 in. screws, didn't have to cut the screw since the 3 in. screw fit. Opener works perfectly and installed easily once I realized the problem."
5,America 2040 1-5,"This entire story line is fantastic. Lots of subplots and twists.This novel set contains all of the characteristics that very few series contain. Sci-Fi storylines, Mystery, Love triangles, passion, and good common sense. Evan Innes creates a novel series that has a perfect form of justice and shows that even the the least of us is important in our own way."
2,Sci-Fi hopeful of human Conquest of the Stars,"This book is a quick read. I feel that you must read the entire series to understand the Authors full story, but I'm here after reading this book looking for the next one."
2,Adorable Mobile,We purchased this mobile for our daughter since it matched her bedding. It is really adorable. I really didn't check out other mobiles--I just wanted something to match her bedding. I wish I had looked around. Don't get me wrong this is really cute and my daughter likes it--but it doesn't play very long. I wish I had gotten a battery operated one instead. My daughter loves watching the bunnies move around--but when they stop she gets upset. You can't use this to put baby to sleep.
4,Great book,Really interesting story of a man who must change his identity to keep himself and his wife alive. Great details on the process and wonderfully written.
3,Dated Comedy About Labor Relations,"Though I am a huge fan of Peter Sellers and he does a creditable job here as Mr. Kite, the union organizer, this film did not really grab me. It was funny in parts but my feeling is that the satire here is the product of it's time or that this film is veddy British and one would have to be an Anglophile of the first order to appreciate it. That said, I would recommend this film to Peter Sellers fans if they want a broader overview of his entire film career."
4,Sellers UK Highlight,"Amazing, and sad, that many American movie-goers think Peter Sellers' career began with ""The Pink Panther."" In fact he had been starring in films for almost a decade before that release. Unfortunately the terrific British comedies of the Fifties and Sixties just didn't get wide enough release in our insular U.S. film market. This is one of Sellers' highlights, a great project about the tug-of-war between industry and labor that, to some extent, still bedevils the UK today. Many of his friends remarked over the years that Sellers only came fully alive when he was playing somebody else; but no one topped him at exploring the comic nuances of a character he had fully nailed, like union boss Fred Kite here. Helps that he is surrounded by a great cast; and why can't Britain make them like this any more?"
5,It's About Time!,"After waiting for years to see this film again, it is exciting to see that it will soon be available on DVD. This is a wonderful film, a must see for all Peter Sellers fans. His characterizations in this film are unforgettable, as are those of the rest of the cast. Having worked in industry myself for a number of years, including some union environments, I find this satire on target with the sad realities of the workplace, even today. Lovers of the Dilbert comics will appreciate this satirical poke at business outside the office. I recommend this film highly."
3,This Movie Still Works!,"Another home run directed by John Boulting. With Ian Carmichael, Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers - and seldom listed (very young) David Attenborough) -- ""We do not and cannot accept the principle that incompetence justifies dismissal. That is victimisation"" -- ouch! This is a no-holds-barred comedy about (dare I say it?) greed, corruption, sex, unions, working, not working, hardly working, strikes (if you're hardly working to begin with, how do you know there's a strike on?), more corruption...Watch Carmichael's Windrush go naively (like Alice) down the rabbit hole of industry; watch a very young Peter Sellers (before he started reading his own reviews) in his award winning role of the shop steward. This is light comedy - with a twist of the knife... It still strikes home, because it's all what brought on the ""Out Sourcing"" of our time. Ouch!!"
1,not enough substance,Simply not enough substance for the price. Most of the information is easily found if you are up to date with current social media. Don't waste your time or money.
4,Nice Case!!,Very well made case.....I bought it for my Epi Dot mik es335 and It fits a little loose on the top part of the body but it don't seem to be moving around any once the lid is closed and locked in place....A nice looking hard case for the money.
4,You get what you pay for.,"There is more vibration than I would like, although not excessivly so. The arms are slightly out of alignment, but probably have little effect on performance or blade life. New owners should lubricate immediately. Speed control doesn't work however the working speed is just where I would like it, and I don't care to go through the trouble and delay of returning the product. All in all I'm not overly thrilled with the saw... I didn't expect it to be for the price paid."
3,Delta SM600 good for the price,"I bought this $100 scroll saw[ASIN:B000G0P5VS Delta SM600 Shopmaster 2 Amp 16-Inch Variable Speed Scroll Saw] for my grandchildren. Overall I found it has surprising vibration and proved mildly unreliable. I hope that it hangs together for them while I am away. Customer service was great in telling me how to fix the link that came apart. ""Put on lots of Locktite."" I use most other tools but not a scroll saw, so maybe I am just not accustomed to scroll saw vibration and problems."
1,Only Buy This If You're A Fan,"I have literally EVERY recording this group has done. I love ManTran, but this album really bites! What the heck happened? Granted, I wasn't expecting another Brasil or Swing, but this makes Tuby the Tuba sound like a masterpiece. So, if you're a die-hard fan, you MUST buy this album. Listen to it once, and shelve it (in chronological order with the rest of your ManTran), never to listen to it again. If you're a casual fan, there are many other ManTran albums you can get that will be better than this. If you're not a fan at all, save your money."
1,Tim Hauser get out of the production seat,"What has happened? Not so like they used to be which is fine but hey, you were once really good and now!!!!!!!! You have lost me as a fan."
1,Manhattan Transfer Fall Flat!,"I have listened to this CD 3 times, its not getting any better Is the Transfer finishing up a recording contract obligation to their current label? This group has set the standard for what they do. They have just lowered the bar big time.Save your money and put on ""Swing"" or their Christmas CD."
3,What's happened to MANHATTAN TRANSFER?,"I was so thrilled to pick up this CD on the date of its release. When I began to listen to it, I began to wonder what has happened to Manhattan Transfer. Overall, I don't like this material. I believe that they could have found some better material to cover. And the production of this album is awful. I wish Manhattan Transfer would do written material of their own. They need to find some great contemparary songwriters of today. Manhattan Transfer, please bring back your style covered on the CD's ""VOCALISE"" and ""BRAZIL"". I believe that the best song on this CD is the last number, ""When You Wish Upon A Star"" and I also liked Old Man Moses (which is just a lot of repetition of words). Would the real Manhattan Transfer COME BACK!!!"
4,my favorite,"I don't know how hot R.J.'s wok is, but my turner didn't melt. (Maybe R.J. let the turner rest in the pan? Don't do that - stir, then take it out. :) I've looked everywhere locally and lots of places online for a chuan or wok spatula safe for a non-stick skillet - this is the closest to ideal I've found. I would appreciate it if the scoop were a little deeper so that the capacity were larger, and if any of you have a recommendation please let me know! Meanwhile, I'm ordering spares for me and extras for my friends."
2,smells funky,"Could not figure out why my food had a weird smell / aftertaste until I took a big whiff of this spatula after cooking. It smells bad, and I'm not even cooking on very high temps with it."
1,NOT WHATS SHOWN IN PICTURE,"The item that I ordered is not what I received. The picture show a certain type of hammer that I have been looking for,the hammer that I received has an extra large head on it . It is too big for construction work where u have to swing into small areas. Had I known this I would not have ordered this product."
2,CD version?,"For anyone who is considering the CD version as appose to the cassette, you may just want to get the cassette. It is kind of irritating to have to listen to a whole eleven minute section just to re-catch a few lines."
2,"buy the book,","As a lord of the rings fan, I find this audio drama offensive. The voices, the sections left out, the actual audio itself was of such poor quality that it left its listener confused, turning up the volume, and vainly trying to find out if this was a new lord of the rings, written by someone else. Usually I enjoy BBC drama's, but this was not the case."
2,Lord of the Rings a Dramatizaation,"I found these tapes to be a complete waste of money. The different actor voices were confusing and I didn't care for the abridgement. However, there is an UNABRIDGED reading of the ""Lord of the Rings"" books (sold as three separate cassettes or CDs) that is worth the price. Instead of paying for a watered down mumbled version, I'd suggest going for the real thing."
5,"Worth the money, by far...","When I first looked at this box set I knew I had to have it. Then my eye glanced the price, and my heart skipped a beat. I knew that they were a long series, and would therefore require many tapes, but never had I imagined they would cost so much. Still, I purchased it, and must say, I am very glad I did. It even held my daughters fleeting attention, and many a lunchtime have we sat around her boombox, eating grilled cheese sandwiches and listening to this enchanting tale."
4,This is the BBC,"Primarily a comment that the preceding review is not of the above product. It refers to the Mind's Eye version of this most beloved of fantasy epics, an interpretation that I heartily agree lacks much. For one thing, it is acted by Americans, who just can't do it, no matter how hard we may try. This version, on the other hand, is about as good as a radio drama might be. The acting is excellent, and the arrangement of the story for radio so good that even I, a Tolkien junkie who finds the recent movies only barely acceptable, enjoy it a lot. With such stars as Ian Holm, it is no wonder. Of course, I always prefer a straight reading to the necessarily imperfectly altered radio drama. Nevertheless, if you are too lazy to read the books or to have someone else read them to you, or if you have read them before and want to see another interpretation of Tolkien's masterwork, this is the recording for you."
2,This audio book is NOT unabridged,"Not only is this audio book abridged, it's an ADAPTATION. It opens with dialogue between Gollum and his torturer in Mordor (did I miss a chapter?), where it sounds to me like they are torturing him with a stapler. Ian Holm and the rest of the cast give good performances but if you've read the books, even they won't be able to save this ""adaptation"" for you. I read and loved The Lord of the Rings and was looking for a nice audio version to keep me company on my long commute - well this ISN'T it."
4,Very well done.,"Most of the reviews here deal with the book(s), not the BBC audio drama. Strange.By now, most of us know the story of the lord of the rings, so I won't go into that. What I will say is that the BBC dramatization is as close to the story as you can get without reading the books. I feel the character voices are well done, allowing you to easily form a picture of them in your mind while you listen. There are also just enough sound effects added to help set the mood without becoming distracting.It is not unabridged. Several events (Tom Bombadil, Barrow Downs etc...) are left out. These omissions don't take away from the overall story.In short, if you can find the time to listen to thirteen hours of excellent ""story acting"", you will not be disapointed. For people like myself, who have a difficult time reading lengthy novels, the BBC radio drama is your best alternative."
5,"Really fun dramatization, well done","I've read Lord of the Rings many times, and enjoy the movies greatly. This 13 disk BBC dramatization is extremely well done, and though it's not ""complete"" it comes quite close. The vast majority of acting is really quite good, and the sounds and music are great. Well worth getting. I've since gotten the BBC Hobbit from the 1960's, and while that's not nearly as well done, it's a lot of fun as well.Perfect for nighttime iPod listening over the course of many nights!"
4,A Pursist's Perspective on LotR Audio CD Box Set (BBC),"If you're looking for an exact rendition of LotR, you won't find it on these CDs. It stays true to the story well enough, but many details and characters are omitted to squeeze the production into 13 hours. Tom Bombadil is a good example. The plot unfolds differently, spending shorter but more frequent periods with the remnants of the fellowship. It's no substitute for the book, but it's time well spent in the car. If you're a selective collector of items like art, calanders, and criticisms, you'll enjoy this addition to your collection.I would have rated it higher had it been longer and more detailed."
5,Thinking straight,"If you are interested in making sure your own thinking is logical, this is the book for you. If you are interested in spotting where others are twisting logic or manipulating the truth, you will find this book indispensable."
4,Beautiful music packaged ephemerally,"This collection of Balinese music moves roughly from pure tradition to modern ""new music"", and as such should be valuable for scholars and world music enthusiasts alike. Sound quality is warm and captures well the acoustic ""beating"" of the gamelan orchestras (as well as that of the kecak performers.) The only caveat with this set is its packaging: The designers had a nice idea, covering the packaging with appropriate motifs and arranging it in a fold-out format, but the discs fall out of their sleeves and the cardboard material is ultimately ephemeral, which is luckily not true of the music."
2,Seen better,"I thought this book had a good premise, but it failed to live up to my expectations. If you think the idea of paralell worlds sounds fascinating, go rent Sliding Doors. This book was too preachy. Finch tells the story as if she's trying to convince you that this is the way the world actually is. Instead of finding interesting ways to explain how her fiction could be science, she uses a lot of jargon that sounds almost-good and expects you to fall for it. This is not science-fiction; it's just fiction."
5,Great Presentation/Demo Guide!,"Peter Cohan has distilled years of customer presentations into an incredibly practical, easy to apply methodical approach. He gives examples, formulas, checklists, and nuggets of information that are so incredibly helpful. He saved me from learning the hard way (the way he did) and my presentations go smoother now. The material is relevant for seminars and presentations as well as demos generally. I found his chapters on Preparation and Style particularly helpful for all my work. ""Great Demo"" is a GREAT BOOK! I highly recommend it."
5,"Make more commission with just 1 change from this book,","This book is profoundly simple yet very powerful. Even a seasoned demo pro will see dramatic results by implementing just one of the recommendations in this book - how much more a rookie! The writing ...More is quick paced, filled with great anecdotes and quips that make you laugh as you go along. Buy one for you and your manager!"
5,"Should be on the recommended reading for ALL Sales Consultants, SEs, TAMs","Some of us give good demonstrations based on gut feel; others need more guidance. No matter where you are in this spectrum, you will find value in the approach recommended in this book.The methodology forces you to focus on understanding the critical business issues - not only what they are but how to use them in your session. Do the last thing first (a mantra reinforced throughout) captures the attention of the decision makers and influencers in such a way that it shows them how they can apply the solution to their requirements.By doing this, the number of demos are reduced, the time to commit can be better managed when you have internal supporters wanting to work more effectively.Read, apply and benefit from the results. I have seen proof of this in my own organization."
3,Doesn't deserve rave reviews,"This book reads like a re-hash of an 80's vintage self-help book, so it may be valuable for lost souls with weak spirits.For experienced, successful presenters looking to improve further it provides a few points to consider. I have not decided yet if those points are worth the purchase price of the book."
3,Needs more sound control,"I bought this item mainly because of it's mp3 input ability.It is an OK system, but lacks in various areas.1.The AC input is into the left speaker. Seems like a strange place to connect to the power source.2. The sound quality controls are not to my liking. There should separate controls for treble and bass.3. The overall sound quality is not as good as expected. Might work in small room.This is not the system for you if your target is very good sound quality."
4,A very good cabaret recording to add to one's collection,"I enjoyed this cd very much. I was especially happy to hear Nova's rendition of Craig Carnelia's excellent song ""What You'd Call A Dream"". Altogether a nice selection to have."
1,God Awful,This was like self flagellation to read this through but I was trapped somewhere with nothing else and tend to be compulsive.At first I found it's global warming idea kind of interesting but it quickly becomes a grade D horror movie script...I suppose it was successful in that I still feel revulsion for it a year later.
2,I enjoyed this once.,"I enjoyed this once, as a student, then I grew up. Some books, the magic lasts forever. This doesn't."
5,works at the equator,I discovered this product at a Wilderness Medicine Conference. I had no idea how effective it would be until I used it on a 2 week dive trip to Indonesia. After 10 days in the sun someone asked me if I had just arrived. They were shocked when I told them how long I had been exposed to the near-equatorial sun. Why aren't you red?... Sawyer StayPut!
5,Impressive,"The ABC Rarities: The Impressions was just plain impressive. Great songs from a great era from a great group. The genius behind this successful group, Curtis Mayfield, was, is, and always be one of my favorite singer/songwriters."
3,Peridot Silver Bracelet,The bracelet came exactly as they said it was. I was a little disappoint on the size of the stones but it was a nice looking bracelet.
5,Are You Looking For Frog and Toad on DVD??,"I remember watching these cute claymation videos as a child and wanted desperately to get it for my own children. After hours of research and disappointment that it has been discontinued, I had a breakthrough. The director who made these claymation videos (john matthews)also made others, most notably Curious George. You can buy from Amazon the DVD Curious George Comes to America and it also has on it both Frog and Toad Together and Frog and Toad are Friends. I was so happy to have made this discovery. I hope this helps others who are looking for it also."
2,it fogged up and no longer can see,"My husband loves Kenneth Cole Watch and he loves this watch, but for some reason, display gets fogged up and could not see the time anymore.... this was second time that happened to same type of watch....."
5,Fabulous (but pricey),Looking for something special on your english muffin Sunday morning? This is it. The tangy flavor of cranberries sweatened and mellowed with Cointreau... hmmmm! Use something good but ordinary during the week like Smuckers strawberry and you'll really appreciate the difference.
3,Not an easy read,"As an E-Commerce professional and instructor, I found this book a little intimidating for beginners.I used this book as a textbook for teaching an E-Commerce overview course for students working towards a Marketing AA degree. This book was not easy for the students to grasp and the writing was full of jargon that is not exactly industry standard. It would be more appropriate for upper class business majors or MBAs. Not the best introduction to the subject matter.However, on the plus side, the book is well organized and quite meaty for those really interested in learning basic E-Commerce concepts."
2,Written in a hurry,"It was pretty obvious that this book was written in a hurry to tap the academic market and current interest in electronic commerce. While the book is fairly well organised, the number of typographical errors and calling URL - universal resource locator, would mislead a newcomer to electronic commerce terminology and makes reading rather unpleasant."
1,Ridiculously Boring,"I am a full time student in a computing program which believe me, requires reading some boring books, but this one takes the cake. The way it was written simply does not flow. It was the only textbook I have read so far that literally put me to sleep. The content is very repetetive, and features graphs that are truley unintelligable. Skip this book unless you absolutely must purchase it for school."
2,even back then it was not so relevant,"This was the textbook for a course I took in college, so I had no choice in the pick.It covers a lot of ground but enphais is perhaps not where it should be for a management book.It is not easy to read, or rather to make sense of, though it is not really off the mark."
1,Horrid!,"Please, if you have a choice of textbooks, do NOT buy this one. I have a feeling the author knows nothing of eCommerce, yet was given 80 references, told to mash them together as non-sensically as possible and fire the result off to the publisher.I've worked in eCommerce for a number of years and this book is a total waste of time and money. Many ""industry terms"" used do not exist. The author contradicts himself on a number of occasions. Many of the charts and illustrations are good for a laugh. I truly feel sorry for people who have this book as their introduction to eCommerce. You're going to come away with a lot of mangled/antiquated theories, and a bunch of ""facts"" that are just plain wrong. I'm sorry to say I had to memorize all of this junk in order to get an A in my course. As soon as I handed that exam in, I made a concerted effort to forget everything I read in this text."
3,my opinion,"Now we study the 1st edition in the school.All of us think it is a little difficult for beginners.Some examples are not familar with everyone,so we cannot konw these cases well."
1,Anti-Anti-Fog,"Yup: it's easy to applyYup: it's totally ineffective!Applied it, according to directions, to the interior of all six car windows. In fact, I even put it on extra heavy (which created a haze) on one window as a test. Every window fogged as completely as they did before applying this product.Maybe it works with only the slightest amount of fogging, but then why wouldn't you just turn your A/C on for two minutes to clear that little bit of fog? If you have a REAL fogging problem, don't expect this product to do anything to help."
1,Product has the OPPOSITE effect of advertised!!,"I applied this to a very clean windshield exactly as the instructions said because I was having minor fogging issues after a night outside.I literally started my car up 10 minutes after application with the defroster on, and my windshield went from crystal clear to completely fogged up in a matter of seconds. The defroster then had to warm up before the fog went away. This repeated the next two days even after a second try at applying. I then stripped the windshield with good glass cleaner and chucked this worthless product!Do not buy!! Instead get the Blue Magic Never Fog from Amazon. That product actually works!"
1,Ineffective product!,"The product fails to serve it's purpose. Here is why it fails fog is a cloud that touches the ground. Therefore it stays in the air and you're only option is to drive towards it and it doesn't ""stick to your windshield."
1,Don't buy,My ac pump quit and it runs when the defroster is on. With out it the windows don't defog. I tried this stuff to fix the problem. It made the windows worse to the point of not being able to see at all with the sun shining through. Just don't buy.
1,DOES NOT WORK!,This is basically false advertisement.. I bought this product because i thought rain-x is the best window cleaning product but apprently not. It just makes the situation worse...
1,did not last,I bought this to keep my bathroom mirrors from fogging up. It lasted for 2 showers and then wore off. Reapplying every 2 days is just too impractical to make this product worth while. I had higher hopes for it.
2,"Lessens fog, impairs visibility","I've used this product multiple times, with the same outcome consistently. It does lessen, not prohibit, fog. Also, it seems to leave an oily consistency on your window. Which vicariously reduces visibility. So, either buy a different product entirely, or save your money. Rain-X in general offers great products, which I use. But, if your like me, expecting this to be as great, again, buy something else.(The only reason I gave this product two stars instead of one, was because there is a slight improvement in fog build-up. There is not enough improvement to warrant purchasing this rather useless product.)"
2,bad item?,"The box was a bit beat up and the bottle cap had two white stains that looked like if they were left by fingerprints with some sort of substance on them. As soon as I unscrewed the bottle cap the liquid substance came out and spilled even though it had a white ""seal."" Just buy it at the store instead."
3,not my scene but....,For a slow moving film it does itself credit so it must be a good film although I think the the nutter in it is a religious nut and only that. However for Believers it could be a film that has a fascination by dwelling on The Vindictive God of the Old Testament.
4,Amazing story by Bishop,"This book renewed my faith in Bishop's work. I was wowed by the skillful way she wove all the stories of different parts of a broken world together, and the creativity and originality to it. The characters are different from what you may expect in a fantasy book, but at the same time, I really enjoyed them and found myself feeling for them before the books end. If you were a fan of Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy, give this one a chance."
1,Don't bother,"Anne Bishop should stick to the kind of storytelling she does best. Everything she wrote based in the world where the Black Jewels Trilogy took place is wondrous. The Pillars of the World series read as if she was trying to write an interesting series. Sebastion was a waste of time and money, I cancelled the others in that set. Sebastion is just too contrived, there's no heart and soul to the writing."
2,Not up to par.,"I love the Black Jewel's trilogy and came expecting a similar offering.This book was not dark, it was not romantic, it was not erotic. I did not feel a particular attachment to the characters. Basically, I just didn't care what happened to any of them. This world may be based on an interesting premise, but things just never came together for me. Mostly this book felt like an offering from the young adult (teen) section.My advice would be to check it out from the library if you just can't resist."
3,Meh,"This doesn't seem to have any edge to it. Feels very generic, not anything like her black jewels series. meh"
4,Great read,"This book is very involved. If you are into complex plots and having a story line that makes you keep up you will love it. I like to work a little for my understanding of a book. The plot was very well developed. Also the characters have believable flaws, which is nice, even in a fantasy fiction. The reason for the 4 stars is that there is a point where I felt that it was too much, the problems and complications had reached a point where it was almost unbelievable. Then, the really good stuff started. I couldn't put the book down after I got past the ""too much"" point. I highly recommend this book. Oh- You really should get some experience reading Anne Bishop before you read this though, she writes very differently. I love it."
3,Not Bishop's best,"I admit that Anne Bishop's fans have been spoiled by her previously wonderful novels, so that may color anticipations.While Sebastian is a decent book, it does not measure up to the prior works of Anne Bishop. After reading this book, I didn't feel connected to any of the characters; they seem somewhat pale and 2 dimensional. Perhaps if less of the book was from Sebastian's perspective, I would have enjoyed it more. The story of the school and the gardens was well thought out and I hope we learn more about the art of the landscapers and bridge builders in the next book.The overall story idea was a wonderful foundational construct and it carries the story through some surprising revelations. I'll still buy the 2nd book with anticipation, but the character elements that I previously enjoyed were not so evident in this book."
2,There's Much Better Albums Out There,"This is one of controversial comedian George Carlin's earlier albums, and was recorded in the middle of the 70s and his ""experimental"" phase. That being said, there's some decent stuff on here (Wurds, Names, and Baseball and Football), but overall George's performance is obviously ""enhanced"" (hindered) by drugs. He's slurry and very slow - a disappointment for those that have seen him live in the last ten years. Unfortunately, this detracts even from the best material on the CD, of which there are only the three above-named tracks.Baseball and Football is an early version of this monologue, and the others worth owning are all available with better recordings (and better speech patterns) on other discs. That being said, ""An Evening with Wally Londo"" will only interest people looking to finish their Carlin collections. If you want a ""best-of"" or a good introduction to George and his fantastic wordplay, you're better off looking elsewhere.Final Grade: D"
3,A Short Intro to Cinema,"The history of cinema wrapped up in some odd 50 pages by author Nigel Hunter. Nothing exciting or offensive here, just a straight up history of cinema. Although its currently out of print, its nothintg I would suggest anyone highly unless it was in a bargain bin and they were just getting into films."
3,An adequate exercise,"For the average disgruntled law student this book provides nothing but added burden and drudgery. This specific product is the update to the previous edition, which, while well researched, and despite interjections of humor, is typically dull in its presentation. Perhaps the dullness is mutual between textbook and student? As a lay person becoming a law person, this series does not make the transition much easier. Still, the foundation series often manages to run circles around much of its stodgier competition. This book does provide sufficient fodder for discussion to at least reach its goal of providing fundamentals. Anything above that is lost due to the sheer vastness of the subject doctrines."
5,One of the Flawless Few,"I absolutely adore Steeleye Span, but I admit that most of their albums are, well, punctuated with some duds.But not this one! Along with a small number of their albums, this one is flawless from beginning to end, and even the order of the songs is ideal for its overall effect. Several gems on this album still blow me away, especially the breath-taking ""Famous Flower of Serving Men,"" the chilling ""I Was a Young Man,"" the valiant ""Female Drummer"" and the delightfully infuriating ""Four Nights Drunk."" Along with ""Hark the Village Wait,"" ""Parcel of Rogues"" and ""Ten Man Mop"" this album truly captures the spirit of this amazing ensemble!"
5,What's it all about - a new musical breaking ground,"this new musical is quite interesting.As a first ""recording"" it definately warrants attention. I believe that new musicals are sprung from their recordings - that is they attain an audience and create interest. Hopefully ""Pilgrim souls"" can do that!"
5,PUNX NOT DEAD!,"this album proves that punk is still alive. and its not like any of the newer bands because it doesnt sound like heavy metal. any one who thinks there punk and gives this a band a bad reviu is probly one of thoes greenday, good charolett, complicated bluprints(simple plan)posurs. any way listen to this album(and band)and buy it PUNX UNITE OI OI OI!"
1,Doesn't work under Windows 7 Pro - Blue Screen of Death,"I purchased this device because of my good luck with Keyspan (now Tripp Lite) USB to serial dongles and I had just purchased a new Windows 7 laptop.The device consistently crashes Windows 7 with the ""Blue Screen of Death"" whenever I stream characters *to* the device at a high rate at 115,200 baud. I don't know what other conditions might cause this---I threw the device in the trash.BEWARE!Best regards,Bruce D. LightnerLa Jolla, Californialightner@lightner.net"
3,Decent but not perfect,"For a product that seems to have been abandoned by its maker I would give this a one thumb up, one thumb down. I was handed one at work since none of our new laptops have serial ports and after finding the XP driver online it does seem to do it's job. Of course, while installing the driver XP will tell you in no uncertain terms to stop what you are doing. That alone may be enough to stop a novice in their tracks. However, installing the driver from the mini-disk or website has not had any bad effects on my Gateway AMD or Dell.So I give it a middle of the road review. Works, but in my opinion could be better. It is a really nice looking rugged product and since I use it with my laptop in outdoor conditions that is a plus."
1,USB to serial adapter,"I tried this product on two different Dell laptops with XP and two different serial devices connected to it. The computer can never see the serial devices. The virtual COM ports show up in Hardware Manager correctly. Both serial devices work correctly when connected to a serial port on a desktop computer. The drivers on the Tripp Lite website are the same as provided on the CD-ROM. This product looks nice and seems to be well built, it just doesn't work."
5,Using in Datacenter,"Works flawlessly for my application. I bought this product to connect to the serial console port on my servers. My Lenovo laptop doesn't have a serial port and I purchased this to connect ,along with a null modem cable, to the 101010 port on my servers. After loading the proper Windows 7 driver this unit works perfectly. A savior when you have to connect to a servers console to do maintenance. I have not tried any other similar products to compare..but no need as this is working perfectly for what I need to do."
4,Just a Guitar Stand,"Seems reasonably stable. Of course, if you bump the cello too hard you could knock it off, or if there was an earthquake, but it won't fall over on its own. The strength of the stand is that it's pretty inconspicuous, so when you walk into the room you see all cello instead of a cello on a stand. Reasonably priced and reasonably sturdy, but I'll point out that you can find these on sale at any Guitar Center. I have guitar stands and they have the exact same dimensions as this ""cello stand."" In fact, if you ask me this really is nothing more than a guitar stand."
4,cello stand,"We bought this stand because my son's cello teacher said it would be easier for him to practice if he had a convenient was to leave his cello out all of the time (not in its case). Having the cello out on a stand does make starting to practice less of an ordeal, and this stand doesn't take up much space, so it fits easily in his bedroom between his bookcase and dresser. It's lightweight, yet strong and sturdy. My one complaint is that while it holds the cello nicely, it has no place for the bow."
4,Compact and steady,"There is no substitute for these--gotta have your cello stand! This one is steady and a fairly low-cost option, and compact enough that it is not in the way when the cello is elsewhere. Very reliable service."
1,worthless,Lasted 1 1/2 summers and then exploded. Didn't arrive with all the correct parts. Worthless product. Obvious why it isn't being sold anymore. A failed experiment on our part...
4,Great book for the laser physics and engineering!,"This book provides the very good and thorough overview of the modern as well as classical laser physics. I recommend this book for a serious laser scientist and engineer. Starting from the black-body radiation to the quantum-well semiconductor lasers, it touches upon various aspects, including mathematical models, governing equations."
5,Beautiful,Was hoping they were a little thicker but they are beautiful. Perfect gift for a gentleman friend who entertains a lot. Bought a few for him.
5,Fabulous,"Everything is great, but ""You'll See"" gives me chills. I bought this after seeing her at the Plush Room in SF. Her personality is as warm & engaging as her voice. What a find!"
1,Zipper clasp is flawed - Do Not Buy,"This bag is great when the zipper clasp is functioning properly. Within the first month of my purchase, the zipper clasp broke off with normal usage. I received a new one from Amazon and the zipper on the second also broke off after about one month."
4,Bottle cooler or lunch bag,"Works well with or without an ice pack. There was plenty of room for 3 Dr. Brown bottles, plus a few smaller items. Or it can also be used as a lunch pack. If you overfill it, the zipper might break on you. We used ours for almost 2 years, before it smelled icky. For me, this did the job for its lifespan. I usually replace coolers and lunch packs after a year and a half anyways due to spillage as milk spills start to get stinky!!!"
2,one major flaw,"While this bag does have relatively good insulating ability, it's not worth the hassle of the zipper (as mentioned in previous review). I, too, have been through a couple of these bags because the zipper pull keeps breaking off. What you're left with is just the part that moves along the teeth, which can make opening and closing quite a hassle. I had our bag replaced by Skip Hop directly as I have some contacts there and did tell them about the problem. They are aware, yet they keep making these bags with zipper pulls that pull right off. Don't waste your time...find another bag."
1,Poor Quality,The zipper broke on this bag within a week of use. Also it was very small and doesn't hold all that I need it to.
2,Liked overall... but small for growing family needs and zipper broke,"We liked this bottle bag overall, mainly because it attached to our diaper bag, was a convenient size for one baby and complied with CA safe food storage regulations. However, within the first year of use the zipper handle snapped off, making it very difficult to open/close. With baby #2 on the way we are looking for something slightly bigger and will not purchase this one again due to the zipper issue. Having read another review discussing the same zipper issue, Skip Hop needs to look into the quality of the zipper on this product."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this bottle bag because I have a diaper bag made by the same company that I was happy with. The bag is quite attractive, but I was pretty disappointed when I realized that it is near impossible to fit three 9oz Avent bottles in it. Then after a week of use the zipper puller broke off. The bag is now useless. I recommend you get a Playtex Fridge-to-Go instead. I have been using one for months and it still works great without having to mess with icepacks. I also bought a Munchkin bottle bag instead that works great. Don't waste your money on this bag!"
1,Zipper is made of cheap plastic,"I am very disappointed in this cooler bag. The cooler bag does have good storage space to store milk bottles. However, the zipper is made of cheap plastic that broke off shortly after I bought it. Also, the ""teeth"" of the zipper doesn't always close completely when you zip the bag. I'm returning it. Cheap, cheap zipper."
4,A little small,"A little small, NOT for MEN but for women, but when put it on,you will find it very cool at any time. Pitty I use it when drive to avoid strong light."
3,You should read this if you are at all interested in royalty,"While the book is somewhat slow at times, if you are at all interested in the history of the British royal family, then you should read it. This woman was probably the original Princess Diana as far as beauty and popularity go."
4,Provocative and passionate,"Stephens has produced a passionate and provocative book about three luminaries of African-American culture who have probably never been grouped together before---and certainly not so interestingly. Stephens, who holds a PhD in Communication, is doing something that more American Studies scholars should emulate: he's making comparisons across political boundaries, and he's challenging some prevailing orthodoxies about how we think about race in the US. Very much worth reading and arguing about."
5,30 inches,Very nice bag! I have a Master Massage Coronado 30 inch table ordered from Costco and came without a bag. I decided to order the bag from Amazon even after the bad reviews and I am very happy with it. I received within 5 days and it fits perfect! Very nice and very confortable to carry the big table! The tag inside reads 30x3.
4,ready set go,the table fits in the case nice. make sure you adjust the shoulder strap or the side handle grip will be awkward. I like the side pockets for extras.
5,Great table.,"I only got to use this table a couple of times unfortunately but it held up just fine. I put a pretty big lady on it once to and it didn't seem like it was gunna break at all. Case is huge keep in mind, but it is a massage table so it's kinda going to be. Good for what it is though."
3,Didn't fit my Coronado Table,"The description states 30"" X 3"" and says it is designed for the Coronado. The case I got was clearly marked 28"" X 2"" on the interior tag and was way too small to fit my Coronado.Maybe the wrong item got shipped, but the exterior tag said ""deluxe case for Coronado"".On the plus side - The workmanship was great and the 3 straps were perfectly placed to make it easy to carry."
4,Good table case,"This case fits the table nicely, has a large pocket for sheets and other items and has shoulder and hand straps. Not a heavy duty case, but should be fine with reasonable care.Robert Turner, RMT"
2,Faithful Performance of Dull Material,"I'm a pretty big fan of Scelsi's work. Anahit, for example, is a true masterpiece. This album, however, doesn't catch Scelsi in his best domain. The textural nature of Scelsi's work is very well suited to large ensembles with an assortment of instruments, where he works with the full sonic range of every instrument to create lush and diverse textures. This technique simply doesn't work with a small homogenous ensemble, such as the string quartet. I've never heard a two hour album that sounds so monotonous and repetitive. The performance is first rate, but I just can't recommend this album to anyone but the most devout Scelsi fanatic. Instead look to his larger orchestral works."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS......,"This is great.....at first. It is easy to put on, it has the front flap which is brilliant. It has everything going for it except......this is the cheapest plastic I have ever seen. I have used it for two months and the ENTIRE front flap has cracked so badly, that it is completely unusable. It is a real shame, and I was very surprised that they would use such a poor quality plastic. I have not had a chance to find an aftermarket replacement, but I remember seeing something at BuyBuyBaby, but I have not gone there to see it. I will update this if I find anything."
3,how individual culture develops?,This book is emphasizing development of individuals. It's about the people side of change and leadership development tools ( decision making tech...)
2,London VS Norway,"I too was very disappointed with the London cast. Having first heard the Norway cast and the studio recording. The new orchestrations for the London show and the changes to many of the songs seemed to cheapen the beautiful music. I recommend if anyone gets the chance, listen to the original Norwegian CD. Its what the london cast should have been."
3,Great West Coast Swing Music,"This CD is filled with excellent songs for you WCS (West Coast Swing) dancers. ""Screecher"" by Charlie Sayles is a FUN song to dance to with a lot of great breaks. It almost sounds like James Cotton's ""How Long Can A Fool Go Wrong"". Buy it, you won't be dissapointed. Especially you blues fans out there!!!!"
4,pretty good,this was one the best reggae albums ive ever listened too. which has alot of nice reggae joints. with nice beats.
4,SD2051 Saddle Bags,"I was not sure about the quality of what I was buying since it was such a low price. Much to my surprise, these bags are a GREAT VALUE and GREAT BAGS!"
5,perfect perfect perfect!,"These are great. Outstanding quality that you would expect from $300 bags. They fit surprisingly well on my gz250 but would look even better on a bigger bike. They can just barely hold a helmet. Being a girl I can easily go over night somewhere and have everything I need, & I mean everything! The studs have rusted a bit but that's my fault for leaving it overnight in the rain. Overall great purchase."
4,Great Gift for your biker,"I purchased these saddle bags for my husband birthday. I first check with other bikers who were giving me prices over $100.I loved the bags but was not sure if it would be what my husband wanted.The bags came in two days and my husband signed for the delivery. He put the box in the corner for a day not knowing it was for him. The night when he came home the bags were on the bed he loved them and told me I will have to sleep in the next room he was sleeping with the bags.They are well worth the money the leather is impeccable, detailing is great. The only thing is missing is lining in case of rain. My husband just put his items inside a plastic bags. You will be surprised at the large size pic does not do it justice."
4,smelly bag,"You get what you pay. Don't expect much from this bag. It doesn't have liner, not water proof. Smell very bad at first. But worth the price and look nice on the bike."
2,Don't buy if you live anywhere wet!,"I live in Seattle and the untreated leather of these bags won't hold up to any rain. I'm not knocking them too bad, I'd rather have them than not have them, and the price is good, but I recommend shopping around unless you live in the desert. They give off a smell when wet that is definitely akin to dead animals. Also the little rivets rusted and looked terrible so I had to pull them all off and the stitching is coming apart. What I'm left with are ugly misshapen things that I only put on my nighthawk CB650 when I absolutely have to."
3,leather Saddle bags,"Large bags, leather is very stiff almost like plastic. The look great, They are not water proof which is fine for 95% of the time. Any larger and I could not fit them on my bike. If they last a year or two then it was a good purchase."
5,Great Product,I would have paid $100 for these saddlebags. Thye look great and seem well made. Delivery was quick
5,Leonard and Hearns,This is one of the greatest fights of all times. It is exciting from beginning to end. They both were definitely two champions!!!!
4,Very good but not excellent,"Two good fights, but there had been many fights that are better than those two. Leonard didn't show any exciting boxing except few series of attacks that were enough two hurt Hearns so badly in first fight that he couldn't continue and in second he somehow escaped with the end of the fight. Hearns didn't know how to finish Leonard in second fight when he nocked him down twice."
3,LEONARD HEARNS SAGA REVIEW,"This tape features both fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns, two of the greatest welterweights of all time. The fights are complete and, the first fight is arguably one of the 10 greatest fights in boxing history. Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed with this tape. I was hoping to hear a lot of post fight and pre fight commentary from experts. I also was expecting to hear comments from the fighters themselves. This tape has none of that. Even the standard post fight interviews with the fighters were not shown, and the blow by blow commentary is not done by the original analysts. The fights themselves are great enough that the tape is worth having if you are a boxing fan, but don't expect to get much in terms of interviews, analysis and background."
1,Folding Bridge Table,"The table, delivered on Sept. 12, was damaged on two sides. I have to return the table and order a new one since I had also purchased the matching chairs. Hopefully the second table will come in good condition. The damage was not due to packaging. The finish of the wood was terrible on one side and there was a nick on the other side."
4,Well built. Cute.,The top green area is not felt nor is it particularly green at all but it is a very nice table.
5,Love this table!,"After searching for quite some time, I finally found this table and waited anxiously for delivery. It is exactly what I wanted and I'm thrilled with it. I had purchased four folding chairs at Linens and Things, but had not been able to find the matching table. This table matches them perfectly. I have them on my screen porch, which we use daily in the summer. The best part is the whole thing can be folded up and put away or easily moved outside or to another room without any hassle. It would also be great in a small kitchen. It is no larger than a card table, but has much more class than the traditional version."
2,Cosco is not watching their vendors,"After embedding a half inch sliver in my hand while removing the plastic wrap, I found the ""Premium Wood Frame"" to be cheap pine. The finish was very uneven, the brackets used to mount the vinyl center to the frame were crooked, and in the process of mounting the brackets, the underside frame was all scratched up. I have sanded and refinished the wood so my wife could use the table. The COSCO name no longer represents what it used to. This particular table screams 'Cheap Chinese"""
2,Waterproof Camera Cover - bulky & heavy,This item will make taking pictures in the water more difficult than the expenses incurred from buying the disposable waterproof cameras! Not a win situation for the environment here as it is a better option to use a disposable camera.
2,5 stars? You gotta be kidding,"If you've been enthralled by the first three seasons of OZ but don't really have the time to devote to it, STOP now! Season four will make you cringe.This show blended realism with high drama in the first 3 seasons. But this, oy! From episode one on, the key word is absurd. or Jumping the Shark. Perhaps you will enjoy rolling your eyes and saying to yourself ""what the heck! This is ridiculous"".But I suspect that like me you'll need to watch it through season 6 just to see where this circus leads. But I guarantee you will not have the same quality of emotions at the end of these episodes that you did at the end of each ep. in seasons 1 through 3."
1,Experiencing Technical Difficulties,"The double sided discs are malfunctioning and Amazon puts you through absolute HELL to return anything. I have spent nearly $3,000.00 at Amazon over the past year, home and work stuff. I will start shopping elsewhere even though I love the site I am sick of consistently Bad service whenever anything goes wrong. The sad part is that I love the site-I even like A9, but they hold returns for FOUR WEEKS before returning credit. So I start shopping elsewhere as of now. And I will be shocked to see this review posted as Amazon has started removing bad reviews...very slimy.Oh, and OZ is great-when I can view the discs..."
4,"Very good, but...","I honestly think that seasons 2-3 of this show are some of the best HBO has ever aired. They are simply brilliant and there is not a bad episode among them. This season was still very good, but this was the first time ever I found myself becoming a bit bored with the show. Don't get me wrong, it was very good, but they needed to shake things up a bit more. There are a few surprises here and there and some terrific storylines, but I think this season would've benefited by being about 3-4 episodes shorter. I cannot wait until Season 5 is released, since that one is much better."
1,OZ - 4th,Bought for a friend as she doesn't have internet. My family and I don't watch stuff that has all the trash contained herein.
1,"Good Series, Bad Discs","I've been buying from amazon for a couple years now and have had very few problems, but unfortunately when I got this season of Oz I was shocked to see that it had scratches on almost every disc. I bought this brand new and I expected perfect disc quality with great playability, but I got a couple episodes that skip or don't play certain sections. I've tried playing them on all my players, but to my dismay I've had no luck of playing those parts. Overall, from the select episodes I've seen, I loved this season and the characters and their relationships are developed quite well. All and all I was happy with the season, but disappointed with the discs."
2,oz season 4,2 discs didnt even play they skipped so bad you couldnt even watch them. One side of disc 2 wouldnt even load. I very unhappy and I had to buy the season again just so I could watch it. I would give you zero stars but I cant figure out how to
5,Great!,"I think that this fourth season is the best ever. This is the face off between Adebesi and Said. They have mutual respect for each, but they have a love-hate relationship. You have to had seen the first three seasons to understand. I have prepurchased this dvd anxiously waiting for January 11, 2005. This will be a late xmas gift to myself. Whatta a way to welcome in the new year."
4,Continues a great series,"I watched all the discs over a period of a week. It continues the plot and intrigue all the way through, but I felt that this season felt more like a male soap opera than the other seasons (1-3). Still many murders continue some in a very brutal fashion. I'd say depending on how much you like the series, the buy is wary. If you have the other 3 seasons, then this one is definately worth it. However, I don't recommend this DVD if you haven't seen the other seasons, you'll be pretty damn lost in the plotline."
2,Seller sold a defective disc,"I was not impressed with this disc set, it appears that the seller may have copied this, and didn't realize the discs were two sided. I missed half of the episodes on this set, and the Seller completely ignored my requests to rectify the issue. All I want is to see a complete set. I would not recommend buying this used."
3,Skippy,"I bought the fourth set of the series at Wal-Mart for $14.88 which is not a bad deal for sixteen hours of play. Like another person who submitted a review, I also have experienced skips on the set I purchased. I handled them carefully to make sure I didn't damage them, but nonetheless they skip. It's not a bad problem, but I paid under fifteen dollars for my copy. I would be disappointed had I paid over thirty."
5,Fourth Season has 16 episodes!!!!!!!!,This series is the best DVD set for the money. It is two series rolled into one! A must buy and a must see!!!!!!!
5,Very Comfy,"I really liked these sandals....the fit was great, very cushy, and the price was awesome for this brand of shoes.......$7..."
5,An innovative collection of music,"From the first track to the last, this cd will captivate you. It is an emotional rollercoaster that ends on a note of hope. I was able to listen to the first release in 1993 which only had eleven tracks. Only a couple years ago Bestor and Cardon went back and added two more to further enrich this masterpiece. I highly recommened it to any lover of music."
5,Own the Original and the second pass is just as good.,I really love this music. The two cuts that were not on the original WordPerfect Demo disk fit very nicely into the overall grouping. The Prayer of the Children makes me cry inside and Electric Highway and Mastermind are two of my favorite pieces of music. I can't recommend this disk highly enough.
5,Innovators,"I had this music when I bought the ""Word"" Software.Now the disc is gone, but I've found the MUSIC."
5,Movies and Games on the Go!,"This tv is great for long summer trips with kids! With the AC/DC operation, we bring videos & video games and plug them in for hours of peaceful traveling down the interstate. At home, this is nice and compact and just perfect for the kitchen. I love to watch my favorite show while I get dinner ready! The quality of the picture is wonderful and it was definitely worth the price."
4,The View From Saturday,"The View From Saturday is about five main characters that have totlly different views about everything in the beginning. Then, after Julian Singh moved to Epiphany, everybody starts to come together. Eventually they become the ""souls"". And to make it better, Ms. Olinski, the first paraplegic 6th grade teacher in the county becomes the soul's teacher and that brings them even closer together.When Ms. Olinski has to pick their 6th grade tem for the Brain Bowl Tournament, guess who she picks? That's right! Ethan, Noah, Nadia, and Julian, The Souls. And this was even after being told that she had chosen the wrong members for the team. They, the Souls, went farther than any of the other 6th, 7th, or 8th grade teams. To find out exactly how far they sent, you are going to have to read The View From Saturday."
5,My favorite!,Well...it is my favorite book overall but the four individual stories weren't so good. The only one i truly liked was Ethan's part. Noah was just to stupid to be in 6th grade. i can relate to Ethan but i can't tell you just quite how.
3,"the different views make it interesting, but confusing","I liked it alot, especially how all the kids were connected somehow, but I didn't really understand what they meant by helping Ms. Olinski stand, and the things Mr. Singh was talking about with her in the car after the play. Other than that, the book really had no purpose, and the little bits about how she didn't know why she picked those particular kids got annoying after a while. Also, Mr. Singh never explained how he knew that she was almost going to pick Hamilton to be on the team. Even though the book was a little confusing, and didn't really tell much of a story, I liked it. I didn't love it, just liked it."
5,A Gem for Grades 3-6,"The View from Saturday is a great book for those looking for a story with views on competition, tolerance, and sensitivity. It's a classroom-lesson in itself. I strongly recommend this book for the classroom. It may be best ""eaten-up"" when read to, unless, of course, whomever is reading it is able to make up good voices and characters with their imagination. Lots of issues are brought up that should be introduced by the third-grade; acceptance/tolerance, handicappedness, prejudice, protecting our earth, family, tradition, and many others. I highly suggest this book for teachers and parents alike. I hope it becomes required in school. I was only looking for a Newbery for my book list, and was extremely lucky to have found this. Enjoy! ~M. Mei; 8th Grader"
4,A really cool story!,"This story was really cool. I liked it because it was a story about 6th graders like me beating 7th and 8th graders in a contest. It was also about learning to be kind and care for others. The book was kind of boring and strange in the beginning, but later on in the book, it was really good"
5,Surprised,When I saw this book I thought it was going to be boring If it wasn't for the teachers I would have never have read it Although it was hilarious! It was pretty good.I don't know if I will read another E.L. Koningsburg book for it was written kinda .......to not exact on the timing of special events!
5,A View from Saturday,"A View from Saturday is a story about four talented sixth graders who win the Acadimic Bowl for their school. I liked the story because the anwsers to the questions are always in the characters auto-biography which followed the questions. Each of the students are different, but are conected in some way. This is what makes it a good story to read."
4,"A bit confusing, but very good","This book was not the best book I have ever read. I think that it's problem was how confusing the plot was. Otherwise, I totally enjoyed the book, and I recommend it to 6th graders, maybe 5th. I also think one of the problems was that I read it in 4th grade. I am willing to try it next year, though."
5,AWESOME JUST AWESOME!!,"This book was the best ever written by Konigsburg, I believe. It was given to me by my grandmother, who is the best librarian alive, as a B-DAY gift & from the first day I got it, I couldn't put it down! If you ever buy it you will feel the same way! Trust me. The way she puts 4 different stories together to make one big story in the end is great!!"
2,"Not Horrible, But not Great",This book was kind of boring and slightly hard to follow. There wasn't a very strong plot. It did not deserve the awards it got. I wouldn't read it if I were you. Read a Sharon Creech book. They're tons better.
1,Not as great as I thought,"I decided to read this book because everyone I talked to thought it was excellent. Although the cover looks interesting, I have tried to read it 2 times and still haven't gotten past the middle. A lot of books start out with an uneventful first chapter, but all the chapters I have read are as boring as the ones before."
3,A review on A View from Saturday,"I found this book ""different"" then most books that I have ever read. Though it was not a bad book, it's just not worth five stars. E.L. Konigsburg should have written more action rather then discriptions. I would recomend this book to readers who enjoy realistic fiction, but I suggest that you just try it out anyway. Over all I thought that this book was basically ""not bad"". The View From Saturday, was something that I thought that I would never like."
5,Well deserved Newbery Winner!,"I read this book for a children's lit class I'm taking in college, and I found it very interesting and creative! I love how Konigsburg introduces us to each character, by the ringing in to answer a question at the bowl. Each character tells his/her story and you find yourself trying to figure out how the kids are ""related"" to eachother before they tell you. It was a great book with lively characters. I recommend it to others."
1,Confusing,"This is a good story, just way to confusing. By the third chapter you're already confused. I think the book jumps around way to much. Konigsburg has written better books than this. What I'm still trying to figure out is, how did this book ever get an award?"
1,Don't recomend at all,This book jumps all over the place and it is very confusing. My teacher Mrs. Little was reading it last year and just stoped reading it thats how bad it was so dont get this book unles you whant to go to sleep
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!,"This book had 4 separate stories, each one from a different perspective, but it completely lacked a focus. Also, the characters were snotty, cynical brats. I like a book which can get me attached to its characters, and believe me, THE VIEW FROM SATURDAY was not it. So if you want a good read, busy yoursself with a good Crichton or Jacques novel and not the sardonic account of four snobs. And, to the Newberry Committee, I hope your judgement is better in the future."
2,Did NOT enjoy!,I had to read this book for my graduate class and I couldn't wait to finish! I feel it is a very boring book with little to no excitement. My son had to read it for his lit. class and he absolutely thought it horrible. He couldn't wait to finish. His friends also read the book and thought of it as torture! Sorry for those who thought this would be a great read!
2,the view from saturday,"I didn't really enjoy this book because I felt like it didn't keep me interested and it seemed sort of boring. It was very confusing and I don't think there was much of a plot to it. However there is one thing I did like about the book and that is how the author made each one of the souls-Noah,Nadia,Ethan and Julian,have there own indidvidual journey besides the ones they shared together.The only part in which I enjoyed was the ending when it seemed to come together. I'm not completely sure if i would recommend this book to a friend because even though it wasn't good enough for my own taste others have seemed to enjoy it."
3,A Tea Party to Remember,"This book is full of suprises, starting from the very begining of the book all the way to the end. It is like a puzzle, filled with pieces that you have to put together. Four kids, who seemed they had nothing in common, were selected by there teacher, Mrs. Olinski, to be in a academic bowl. Everyone wanted to know, why did she choose these four people, but she didn't even know why. I recemend this book to people who like realistic fiction with a little bit of mystery mixed in. Find out how Noah, Nadia, Ethan and Julian are all connected, why Mrs. Olinski chose them and much more in this interesting book."
2,An Ok Book,"The View from Saturday is an Ok book. I didn't think it was all that good but it was a humorous book. The plot seemed kind of confusing because it jumps from the future to each characters past or what makes them a good contestant for the contest. It was kind of confusing because there were so many characters that jumped in and out of the book. Overall, The View From Saturday is not what I would like to read."
5,A must-read.,"Once I started The View from Saturday, I could not put it down. It is definitely one of my favorites. This book distinguishes itself in many ways. One way is the refreshing organization of the story. Reading it is just like working on a puzzle one area at a time, starting from totally opposite sides of the puzzle. You see the finished picture when you turn the last page. I enjoyed how the characters seemed to be all inter-related before they even became ""The Souls."" I must confess, the end of the book was a little surprising. I had to read the ending a couple of times, looking at it different ways. I could stand to read it a couple more times! I am a teacher,and I cannot imagine giving this book to anyone below 6th grade honors. There are many subtleties in the book that I think older students could appreciate more. Thank you, E.L. Konigsburg, for a wonderful and thought-provoking story.P.S for teachers: Excellent book to use for voice, point of view, and repetition in a story."
4,"It was a great book,but kind of strange.",It was a great book but kind of strange. Very interesting and unexpected. I liked the way she separated all the characters into sections of the book and then tied them all into a knot at the end. Just one thing that I didn't like about it: there were three boys and only one girl. It was kind of funny when he got the pink heart puzzle. Pink!!! for a BOY!!!
5,A Very Wonderful Book,"This one of my favorite books. A tad confusing at the beginning, but excellent after you get past that. I read a lot, like four or five hours aday, so I've read a lot of books. I read the reviews and some people thought it was inappropriate. I have been hearing swear words in school since third grade. I am eleven. One of my favorite parts was when Noah's Grandpa made a comment about making love to the same woman. Sha! A shanda far die kinder.It's not inappropriate, it's funny."
2,a confusing book,I didn't like it much it was confusing at first. I still haven't figered out why it is called The view from saterday. I think it would have madde more sence if it wasn't so confusing. It turns out when it tells you there's a flash back it's really flashing foward.
1,the view of saturday,the book was about a teacher and thease four kids and a paralyzed teacherthat is trying to get the kids to a acodemic bowl. And they firgure out that two of the people grandparents are get ing marided in Florida.
4,The view can be found evey Saturday,"This book is about four characters. One characters is a boy named Noah. Noah, by mistake is became best man at Nadia's grandfather and Ethan's grandmother's wedding. Noah is really nice and is a great calligrapher. Another character is a boy named Ethan. Ethan is very quiet kid and finds out he is very interested in halos. Julian is another character. Julian is the strangest kid on the bus; this is because Julian invites everybody to a tea party. The last character is a dog. Nadia is a dog with red hair shaped like a halo. These characters go through many adventures in this story.The View from Saturday is a great book and children from the ages of 12-14 will love it! This is a story for children who can keep track of more than one character. This story is surprising and has twists and turns. At first I didn't really like this book, but after I read more and more of this book, I LOVED IT! The View from Saturday is a wonderful book!"
4,cacgoose,This was an interesting book with a unique approach to its writing style. I liked how we were introduced to the characters and how we could see their answers reflected in their lives.
2,This is a Cheap Binding,"The print is small, the paper is low-quality pulp and there is no dust jacket. I bought several other Newberry Award hard cover books for my granddaughter - this one was the most expensive and had the lowest quality of the group. Not a good buy."
5,Helping Grandparents,"We are grandparents who are getting married. We bought this book for our adult families as ""required"" reading."
4,The View From Saturday,"I needed this book for a class on Writing for Children. This book was in stock at a very reasonable price and was received within a few days, in plenty of time for my class."
4,Teamwork Pays Off,"I really liked this book because it was about different kids that worked together to meet a common goal. The characters were kids that I could relate to, and the plot moved along so you won't get bored. I would like to read other books by this writer and see if they are as good."
5,So unique!,"I truly enjoyed this book. Konigsburg took the individual stories of four sixth graders and connected them all together to create a novel of friendships, hope and understanding. This is a book to be shared with others. Great for literature circles."
3,The View From Saturday,"The view from Saturday is a book about friendship and competition. The four ""souls""come to make a perfect team for the academic bowl team but can a six grade team win against a eighth grade team. Come into The View From Saturday and find out for yourself. Here are the ""souls"":1) Julian is magical and wise one2) Ethan, A Quiet Potter who can never in his teachers minds live up to his older brother.3) Noah is into calligraphy and was the best man at Nadiah's grandfathers wedding.4) Nadia with curly red curls and is the only girl on this one of a kind academic bowl team.If you like friendship, turtle walks and cute dogs named Ginger this the book for you.Warning: if you are an adventure book person this may not be the book for you!!!!!!!!!A. T. F."
3,The View From Saturday,"The View From Saturday is the story of four sixth graders competing together in an academic bowl. Julian Singh, a quiet boy from England. Ethan Potter, the younger brother of a teenage star. Noah Gershom, a calligrapher. Lastly, Nadia Diamondstein, a turtle lover. Together, they make a great team along with their coach, Mrs. Eva Olinski, a paraplegic.If you like friendship, turtles, calligraphy, and an acting dog, this is the book for you. Although this story is not one packed with adventure, it is none the less a good book.If you are a fan of Eragon, Eldest, and Harry Potter, this is not the book for you.~Lana W. Charlottesville Virginia"
4,The souls,"I would recommend this book because it is funny fun to read. It tells a story about four six grader making it to the Academic Bowl and how they won against the seventh and eighth graders. Also how they were able to win the entire championship even though they weren't the most popular. Also even though at first they may not have been friend ,in the end they became best of friend and made themselves into the souls. I could not put this book down because it was interesting to see what the character would do next and I was happy to read this book it had a great ending."
4,View from Saturday,It is a wonderful book about four friends and a paraplegic teacher. All of them a related in some different way. This is a captivating book in which you will root for some and jeer the others. The author gets you caught up in each of their different stories. Inspiring you on every page. A must read for sure!
4,View From Saturday review by Carolyn,"In this book, The View From Saturday, the author tells of a group of kids that teach their teacher about people, and that kindness is not all lost. Noah, Ethan, Nadia, and Julian are a group of sixth graders that become `The Souls'. Each one narrates their own story, where each one helped out in some way, or had a good intention about something. Ms. Olinski picks `The Souls' as an academic team, and they blow all other teams that underestimated them out of the water. Ms. Olinski learns that there are always kind people, and that there may not always be an answer for things, just that sometimes you have to go with your gut feeling, even if you can't explain it."
2,view from saturday review,"I do not recomened this book because of the way the writer goes on and on about nothing. The book is good in some places but the writer uses to many deatails in insignificant parts of the book, and not enough at significant parts of the book. The book doesn't seem to have a plot. With more deatails and a plot the book would be much better."
2,RUN...run as fast as you can.,"RUN! This book brings torment as I recall the agonizing days of reading it in the 6th grade. Do not read this book. I have read the other reviews and am dissappointed to see that these people talk about it as if its th most wonderful thing in the world...as if our world, filled presently and probably forever with greed, hate, sorrow, can turn out to be so perfect. As though life will always have the answers. I wonder about the peiople who had written the other reviews...how old can they be? It is clear that none of them, from there technique of writing, could possibly be children. But wait...one minute...isn't this a children's book? I cannot comprehend how grown ups can relate to what a child may think of these book. When had read it, the book had deemed to be boring, plain and dull with no point to its ending. I only hope that you heed my warning and think again before paying with your time and money."
1,You've Got to Be Kidding,"If I could I wouldn't give this book a star at all. What's the deal with the Newberry award? It seems to be an exclusive club where the same authors win over and over again. Case in point: E. L. Konigsburg. Her first book was terrible; this book hits new lows. The characters are confusing, the plot can be figured out in two chapters (read: very bored seventh graders) and she writes the most awkward sentences I have ever read. There is assuredly much better authors out there than this woman. She's terrible! The John Newberry award seems to be in the possession of a committee that wants only a very few of its club members to win. The fact that this awful dribble has even been considered for an award only furthers this belief."
1,The View From Saturday=Boring!!!,"Personally,I hated it. 30 pages left and there has been absolutly NO excitement! It might just be me but it seemed like one page they were talking about saving turtles and the next a dancing ivory monkey!!! If I havent yet made my point then you must not really be trying to read this! I read this for a class assignment and if I didnt have to read it I would have never heard of it! Honestly I think I'll try to stay away from books by E.L. Konigsburg because reading this book made me think that all her books would be unentertaining. If I could I would only give this book half a star so I advise you NOT to read it!"
3,Meaningful but not as charming as Mixed-Up Files,"Ms. Konigsburg's ""From the Mixed-Up Files..."" is one of my favorite children's books and I expected the same easy charm and playfulness in this book. This book has an almost awkward style at times although I liked the intermingling of different perspectives for each of the main characters. This book is definitely more meaningful than ""Files"" in that it examines the potential that even 6th graders can have to change their own lives and those around them. Not a book I would re-read but worth while."
4,The View From Saturday,"This novel is a great book for kids and adults. It is written in second and third person... This novel is about a 6th grade teacher, Ms.Eva Marie Olinski, that is paralyzed from the waist down. She was in a car accident which killed her husband. She coaches an academic bowl team in Epiphany, New York. The team is made up of four 6th grade students: Ethan Potter, Noah Gershom, Nadia Diamondstein and Julian Singh. They have been friends since they were going to have tea at Julians house. They are all related in some way. You will find out how they are related if you read the book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I hope you will enjoy reading this book also."
4,This is a great book with many cut-off and start-up stories!,This is a very good book to read to pass time or for a special school report! It has many different situations going on at once and you don't know what's gonna happen next! It keeps you interested in what is goign on inside the characters' minds and future!
3,It was a little confusing,"I thought that View from Saturday was a little confusing for me because it would jump around too much and I felt like I couldn't follow the story that well. I did like the teacher's character though, because she was always happy, and ready to teach."
2,Not the best,"I had to read this book for school. I found it very confusing and hard to follow. There were too many flashbacks. I felt the plot was boring and there was no climax in the story. This is not how 6th graders act, very unrealistic. The characters in this book actually didn't interrupt each other. Don't bother reading The View from Saturday, unless you like plain boring books."
4,The View from Saturday,This is a GREAT Book! I read this book because I had a book report on it and I enjoyed it to. But the only part I dont like was in the begining because it started out long and ends short but I love the book. I would recomend it but only to a 5th-6th grader.
1,Crap = This Book,"I had to read this boook for school my teacher has no taste in books. What a complete waste of time it is confusing. If you like tea, turtles, and a boy who i think likes his cousins and i mean LIKES her then go on with your mad self."
1,Why Me,"I had to read this book for school. It was horrible. I would never recommend this book to anyone. It had absolutely no plot. The auther told you the ending on the first page. The climax was boring. I didn't even know it was the climax. There was no action at all, and I don't think that 6th graders really act like that.When I read a book I like to want to read the next page. With this book, I wanted to turn the page but just to see if it was over.The best part about The View from Saturday was the last page because I knew that I was almost done. I don't understend how this book won a Newbery Medal."
4,Good but confusing,"I liked this book, and I liked all of the author's other books, but frankly, this is a little confusing. It flips back and forth, and you're not always sure where you are or who is talking. It was well-written and the characters are smart but too undeveloped."
3,We have a Mother Daughter book club!!,"""Some of us really liked it, but others didn't really like it. I think that it is a really interesting book and I like how it pulled 4 stories into one."" ""Number One Book!!!!!!!!!!! I liked it."" "" At the beginning the book was a little confusing at the end it was really interesting. Sometimes you couldn't tell who was talking."""
2,"Confusing, jumped around, should have had a beginning map","Half way through the book I started figuring out what was what, and who was who. It jumped from chapter to chapter without any setup. It was a cute story, but if it would have laid out a nice story map in the very beginning with a list of characters it would have made more sense. This was a required book for class, if it had not been required I never would have finished it. I would have quit after the first chapter."
2,This author has done better.,"I'm 11 and I read all the time. I love to read. But I honestly think that this book was a little abstract. I'm not saying this in offense to the author, in fact, I think that E.L. Konigsburg is a wonderful author! I loved her book ""From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"". But I don't think that this book was worth it. But others might like it, YOU might like it, after all, everyone's tastes are different. This is just one opinion."
2,Characters without Flaws,"This books starts out okay, and you belive that it will be another ""Mixed up files"" caliber book. But it is not. The main problem I see is the main characters, The Souls, don't have any real flaws. Oh yeah, sure Noah is a little know-it-all, but thats as worse as it gets. They all just do everything right and win win win. The teacher being in a wheelchair starts out promising, but it is underdeveloped and you just feel like the author was making another ploy to tell you how great it was that these four kids and their teacher made it this far. The reader is left feelling cheated that their intelligence is not accounted for. Everything is black and white in this book. I had to force myself to finish it."
3,Okay book,"This was an okay book. It had its moments when it was really cool but it also had its boring parts. I liked how they tie all the characters in together at the end. But, I thought that they could have gone a little further into actually describing the Academic Bowl. I liked how they were the first sixth grade team to ever compete against an eighth grade team. I also liked how they all bonded together. There were some pretty cool facts in the book that you would not hear everyday. I liked how you learned facts that you would never have known before."
1,Confusing,By Peyton MowerI started to read this book and found it very confusing. Even after I found out what was going on I Thought it was not a very good book.
3,The View From Saturday,"I liked this book and it was a nice story, but it was a bit confusing with all the switching around it did. Other than that it was a very enjoyable story/book."
2,I don't like this book because it is odd.,I don't like the plot or the characters.I think it's kind of boring
2,Sometimes the past is best left in the past.,"I'd heard good things about Dead Horse, and was expecting more. You know how you grow up on certain records, and at the time you think they're the best ever, and then five years later you listen to them again and you think, ""Huh. What was that all about?"" That's this record. Average sound, average songs, weak '80s underground metal production. I can see digging it as a nostalgia trip, but it's hard to see anyone in 2001 really being blown away by this.But Scottish Hell does kick."
2,This was the worst thing i ever spent money on!!!,"When this plush came in the mail and I opened it out of its packaging, I knew immediately it was a fake. In fact, one of the legs came off in the mail! The stomach isn't symmetrical, it's not as big as other pokedolls released by Nintendo I've looked up countless reviews, so I know what I'm looking for. Save yourself some time and don't buy this toy!!!"
5,excellent product,I love the folding chairs. They were right on time for a gathering I had during the holidays. They are classy and great.
5,Love them!,"These chairs are awesome. I needed some extra seating for the holidays and these chairs looked right at home alongside my Ethan Allen dining room set. They are sturdy & easy to use.When folded, they do take up more room than regular metal folding chairs, but that is a small price to pay for such great pieces."
4,Nice but hard to store and move,"The chairs arrived quickly and were in good condition. They are very comfortable and looked nice around the Thanksgiving table. The seat is heavy and padded. When the chairs are folded up, the seat keeps popping free making it difficult to carry the chairs around or store them. I ended up using bungy cords to bind the seat to the chair. Then I could store the chairs in a closet or on hooks in the garage. It might have been easier to buy a wooden folding chair without a padded seat that would stay folded and use a separate cushion."
3,music fan from texas,"Although there were so many other good performances at woodstock 99 this is the hard and the heavy head bangin stuff. if you like the rock/rap more than the dmb/rusted root sound, this is the disk for you."
1,A Disgrace to woodstock,"Not even some good talents like DMX, Ice cube and some decent bands could save this terrible waste of time, they have the worst bands in music history, everything else is just horrible, there is not even good thing about this album.Woodstock 99 is a waste of time and my money.Fred Durst is a clueless, talentless man."
3,So...,"what happened to the resst of the songs. yes, i loved it, but there were so many other worthy performances. the main reason i bought this was bulls on parade. now i love buckcherry. buy it, but you could be disappointed."
3,Needs more info,"I carve and also paint, and to me this book needs more information...Usually there is a grid for cutting your block of wood, and a ratio for enlarging, couln't find it...ALso should have a pattern for top and side view for rough cutting of your block...I was hopeing for more detailed instructions..The book arrived when I was told it would, and in the condition advertised."
3,I love this guy,"It's the signature song of this ablum that I love, Meadowlark. Actually, as an accompanist I have had the pleasure of learning this song to accompany a wonderful singer, and then fell in love with this music. I agree with the post below that there are really only three strong songs in the show, but I think that they are worth getting your hands on. They get 5 stars, the cd gets 3."
1,"Not as expected, unable to return","Understood this to be sugar-free jello when I ordered; received regular jello, then discovered item was non-returnable."
2,You're soaking in it.,"Dull as dishwater. I read everyone's glowing reviews. So, I bought the disk for my partner who loves this sort of music. When he woke up from the syrupy sweetness induced coma, I decided to hide the disk in the back of the collection.Thanks for the advice guys!"
4,Very good but not quite perfect.,"I got 3 of these. One for my combo blade and 2 for my Freud box joint blade. The insert is a quick easy way to upgrade the cut of any saw and for the price it would be hard to justify making your own. Overall it works extremely well. It greatly reduced tearout on plywood and other difficult wood. The set screws easily adjust the plate so you get a nice flat surface. My only complaint is that on the General Int. 220 the insert flexes on the left hand side of the blade. This is seldom a concern but cutting small tenons on the left side of the blade could be a problem. The right side is much beefier and I haven't had any problem there. The up side is that the plastic is very slick and it is easy to push material over it.If you don't have the time, or don't want to make your own this is a great general purpose insert. Get one for each blade."
1,Hair Off WAX strips,"Unlike other wonderful, carefully-shaped Hair Off products I eagerly buy when I can find the scare little things, these boxes arrived filled with rectangular, heavily-waxed strips all of one size and shape! The heavy wax remains on the face after the strips are pulled off... and so does most of the hair! They just were not the same product I had grown to love."
1,Not a hair did it remove.,This product didn't remove one hair from my face. All it did was make my face sore. Would not recommend it to any one.
3,wax strips,"I really like the convenience of this product, but it is hard to place accurately and does not work quite as well as the traditional type of wax (I used for eyebrows). It does work, after a couple tries, but then I have to pluck what it misses by hand. I think I'll try another kind next time, as I am hoping to combine convenience with good results."
2,"weak, easily broken","You pretty much HAVE to use this product with the XV-6700, but doesn't mean you have to like it. I think I'm on my 3rd, as the tabs that hold it to the phone are really flimsy, shear off after a small amount of use. Wish they'd reinforce it, perhaps make the tabs (or the whole thing) out of metal somehow."
1,shallow,"The author takes a superficial smorgasbord approach which is a totalwaste of time to anyone at all familiar with the recent history of mathand absolutely unenlightening to anyone who isn't. Hecovers many areas in which he is not trained - and it shows -laughably in some cases [e.g. referring to the ""moonlighting""conjecture].The only decent thing in the book is the foreward written byDyson- and it's a shame he didn't go on to write the wholething. Thanks for nothing P.U.Press."
2,says who?,"I'm not sure who chose this particular compilation, or what standard they used, but it really doesn't come close to representing these boys at their best. Of the (only) ten songs offered, perhaps only one (the Jug of Punch) could be considered one of their best. The songs can all be found on other Clancy compilations, with a slew of better songs accompanying them."
1,What a joke!,"Ten songs! What a joke! What a low-value compilation of a great group. The record company ought to be ashamed. They probably wonder why no one buys the group's music anymore -- because the company releasing the music has no real interest in the music or honoring it or pleasing the fans. They have not even figured out that they are losing money doing such shoddy compilations. When they do, we will be able to buy real albums -- rereleases of albums or serious compilations of music released by these legends of folk music."
2,Far too liberal leaning and bias,"Great video and naritive. However, this should have been a neutral look at President Reagan and instead was very Left (liberal) leaning. It is not neccessary to ""Portray"" President Reagan in any partisan light in a commemrative documentry. True, he was a Republican President, but he was an ""American"" President. It should be enough to just present the man and his presidency without leaning the depiction of him either way.

5,A must-read!,"Dr. Grosskopf's book is spell-binding! Beautifully written, poignant, insightful! It delves into family secrets that transmit from generation to generation, damaging lives with their unspoken power. For anyone who's ever suspected that there is an untold story in the family, one that needs to see the light of day if lives are to change for the better, this is a must-read! Secrets, unseen and unspoken, are transmitted as surely as genes. This book explains and reveals what we need to know, to be better relatives and friends and lovers."
4,A good addition to the Madeline Bean series!,"To get the full enjoyment from this book, you should really start at the beginning of the series with Sympathy for the Devil, and read the books in order. Maddie's life of food and friends will make more sense when you know its history.I can't wait for the next book to come out, but I hope that if Honnett is out of the picture, that someone intelligent steps in since I preferred reading about Maddie's relationship with Honnett more than her one with Arlo."
2,Mediocre book in a mediocre series.,"in my store, this will only be recommended for hardcore food mystery fans, readers who enjoy celebrity name dropping and mystery fans who don't mind holes in the plot too much. i'll tell everyone else to wait until it comes out in paperback. meanwhile, could someone suggest the editorial copywriter tone it down a notch: great literature this is not and the author's main claim to fame is writing for game shows. you'd think she was Tolstoy from the write-up. it is not only silly to get so breathless about this book, it's not very helpful to those of us who must read through as many new titles as we can so we can recommend them to readers. it makes it even harder to find and recommend truly good books when the descriptions are so over-the-top."
4,Loved the inside look at television game shows!,"I sure came away from reading this book with a clearer picture of what it's like on the set of television game shows. Ms. Farmer knows what she is writing about in this crazy world. Madeline finds herself working as a writer on a temporary gig for a culinary game show. As much as she is enjoying this new experience, inexplicable things keep happening. One of the writers has disappeared, people keep leaving the show, her and Holly find a secret room, and people are dying inexpicably around Las Angelos on a certain day of the week. Madeline needs to find out whether or not all these things are connected. The linking thread among all these strange happens is a tenuous one at best, but she manages to figure it out. This is another strong entry in a strong series. I love reading to find out what Madeline and her friends are getting up to."
5,"Ancient Mysteries-The Sacred Waters of Lourdes-five stars for Subject,0 stars for Skeptics and blasphemy","Good insight into The Waters of Lourdes but sadly only two supporters of it are in it and the rest are all skeptics or the egghead crowd always wanting proof of a God that has Always Existed and His loving Ever Blessed Mother.You hear these keywords ""Reason"",""Science"",etcera to cover up the intolerance they have towards The Church,which as it has been shown in this ""documentary""actually had skeptics herself who as always work with science and reason to validate miracles and in itself to prove The Church is Right."
4,Super Hits?...Where's the Greatest Hits or Best Of?,"Ive never been a fan of the Super Hits series,because of the usual 10 song set they have.And they still dont get the 10 best songs.""Sleeping With You"" from the Hold Your Fire album should have been included at least.But Firehouse only had a handful of huge hits to put on this cd.They became big at the end of the hair band rock era,which in the end didnt allow them to really put out more hits of their genre.But overall this is the best you are gonna get from them for now."
3,Only Ten Songs?,"I don't know who's idea it was to make a 'Super Hits' CD for Firehouse and only include ten songs...While the songs on this collection are very good and it contains some of their biggest hits, it is missing more songs than I care to mention here. I believe if you are going to do a 'Greatest Hits' type of CD, then do it right... There was little to no effort shown here. I guess if you are a real Firehouse fan, you will have all of these songs already so it's no big loss. If you are interested in Firehouse, but don't have their CD's, then I guess give this a shot. It could have been A LOT better, but newbies will not notice."
5,"I've finally found my ""Love of a Lifetime""....",".....and it's this CD! WOW! It's unreal. If you like that modern rock, alternative gobbledygook that radios spit out today, then run, this CD is not for you. Why? It's melodic. It's heart-breaking and gut-churning. It's everything you expect from Firehouse. Their best songs, all one one CD! I mean, this is proof that life can't get any better than right here, right now....until Super Hits II is released! (I can hope, right?)"
5,great budget item,"This is one of my favorite Super Hits CD's. For the price of this CD, this is a can't miss; although their are only 10 songs the price counts for the quality and selection of songs they provided. The linear notes gives you a brief story of FireHouse and their best songs. Overall this is a great CD and I would recommend this to a friend."
5,A Great Collection,"This is a great collection of one of the '80's best ""Hair Bands"" and their power ballads. Well worth the money. Still sounds great."
1,complicated,"Did not even try this product, resold it to a friend with more patience. can get the same whiteness from strips."
5,Great product; fast shipping,"I'll never buy tooth bleach from the dentist again. This product worked much better and was remarkably cheaper. I had no teeth sensitivity, either."
4,"It's A Little Tricky To Use, But It Works.","I didn't notice much difference in my teeth when I used this the first time, but my wife did so she has started using it to. It's hard to beat it for the price."
2,Not worth it.,Listerine pre-brush mouthwash gives a better whiting result. This product strips the enamel off your teeth and makes them extremely sensitive.
5,I'm blinded by the brightness.,This whitening kit comes with everything you need including two mouthpieces which you can mold to the shape of your teeth. The directions state the gel can cause irritation to the gums but so far I've experienced none. I've used the kit now for about 5 days and have seen considerable whitening.
3,Why rush?,"I used this product a couple evenings in a row, applying to teeth using a QTip, then putting in the funky tooth covers to minimize drooling and wash-off of treatment. Left in place for about 15 minutes before rinsing. After second treatment, had significant pain in areas where my gums had receded some from the base of teeth over the years. Have given them a rest for a couple weeks and will try again, but will separate the treatments by a few days to allow my mouth to recover between assaults from this strong stuff. Whitening has been modest to moderate; wish I'd done a ""before"" photo so I could compare. With hindsight, I'd go with a milder solution, apply every few days for a couple weeks. No need to aim for total results in only a few days."
3,Performed SO- SO.....,"This product did not perform better than anything else I've used: strips, gels, etc... Custom fitting the trays was not a problem. One thing nice is that the gel did not cause any sensitivity common with these types of products."
1,These are absolutely terrible!!!!,"I can't stress this enough, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It has done NOTHING but damage my teeth, while following the directions EXTREMELY close, and applying the gel very carefully. I went to my doctor after 1 week of use and he told me I have had dramatic damage done to my enamel and that I need to stop using this product. I had healthy, albeit slightly yellowed teeth.Stay away from this stuff!!"
4,teeth are whiter,My teeth have gotten quite a bit whiter since using this product. I would def. use it again.
4,Great customer service and product!!,Received whitening kit before expected date. I didn't see any change so I sent the seller an email about the problem and since they stand by their product 100% they sent me a replacement tube. Along the way a label to the replacement package was torn and unreadable by USPS and had to be sent back to manufacturer. Seller then sent the item as PRIORITY mail and got the product 2 days later. I'm EXTREMELY impressed on the customer service I received. I'm on my 3rd day using the replacement and people already started noticing the change in color. =] VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!
5,Spectacular product!,I never thought this would work as well as it did.Getting them to fit my teeth wasn't hard at all. I only have slight discoloration and a few stains and this worked very well. They're now pretty white just after a few weeks use! Going to keep using it to see how white I can get them.
4,"Good, not amazing.","This is the only whitening kit I've ever used so it is hard for me to compare but this kit is easy to use, the trays are easy to make if you follow the instructions. I expected a more drastic change in whitening but I did notice a difference. The kit also comes with some mineralizing gel that is supposed to strengthen and protect your teeth. Good product but I am still considering having a dentist do a bleaching."
1,Handles break easily,The plastic handles can be broken easily and are not strong enough to hold this heavy plastic and bulky holder. I would not recommend.
1,"Awful, awful, AWFUL cupcake carrier!!","Can I give this 0 stars?I've used this case only twice, as an utter last resort, the first time, it threw my perfectly decorated cupcakes all over the place (in spite of being totally horizontal on my knee on a 10 minute car trip to the destination) resulting in frosting all over the tub and destroying my cupcakes. The 2nd time, I learned my lesson and frosted AFTER I got to the party, but after getting to my destination, I still had to pick the cupcakes up off the tray and un-stick them from the sides. Terrible!If you want a cupcake carrier, go for the cupcake courier, it may be more expensive, but it's worth every penny! It holds 3 x Dozen cupcakes and it's fantastic, I use it all the time to transport fully decorated cupcakes and have never had an issue with it!"
1,Wilton 3-in-1 Caddy is useless,"I received this as a gift and was very excited to get a GENUINE Wilton!! What a disappointment. The carrier only holds 12 regular sized cupcakes; the adhesive they use to put the labels on leaves an unsightly mess because it won't come off, and the carrier itself is bulky. I found another carrier that was more compact, holds 24 cupcakes and was much less expensive. PLUS the bottom pan of the other holder is an actual baking pan!!"
5,Best Carrier Ever!,"I love this carrier. So far I have used it for both regular sized and mini-cupcakes, but have yet to use it for a 9x13 cake. The only thing that could make it better would be if it had multiple layers so that it could store more. That being said, I want to get a 2nd one so I can carry 24 regular cupcakes at one time."
3,Great in theory,"I loved the idea of a carrier for my mini cupcakes. Unfortunately, the wells aren't deep enough to hold the cupcakes in place. I had the carrier sitting on the floor of my car and six treats bit the dust when I made a left turn--frosting was everywhere, the carnage was terrible (but edible!). Now I need to come up with something to hold them in place while being transported."
2,not good,"Great as a cake carrier, terrible for cupcakes. I ruined 24 mini cupcakes and I hadn't even made it out of my garage yet because the cupcake holders are too short. Works good for cake, but it's called a 3 in 1 carrier and its not-it does 1 thing well and the other 2 terribly."
3,Insert for Cupcakes and Mini Cupcakes is too shallow.,"The case itself is roomy and good for cakes. But the insert for cupcakes is very shallow, so your cupcakes will likely fall over in the car, even if secured in the case with the lid latched. Also - the insert only holds 12 standard cupcakes, not enough for a class of school children. I have removed the insert and tried placing the cupcakes close together, but the plastic surface is slippery and they still have a tendency to topple over."
1,Terrible for cupcakes,"I own a cupcake business and go back an forth to farmers markets. I create beautiful ""demos"" of my cupcakes and wanted to use this box for them. However the walls of the ""cups"" just are not high enough and everytime I used it, no matter how careful I was, the cupcakes would tip over. I guess for a sheet cake it might be OK, but for cupcakes, forget it."
2,Not recommended for cupcakes,"3-in-1? Not so much. Suitable for sheet cakes, perhaps, although I've never used this for sheet cakes. I bought it to transport both standard cupcakes and mini cupcakes, but the ""holders"" are far too shallow for either size cupcake. If I wanted to carefully carry this carrier, keeping it perfectly level at all times and not subject to any momentum of being in a car, this carrier might work. But I need to drive my cupcakes somewhere, and set this carrier either on the seat (heh, I put the seatbelt around the carrier) or on the floor, and the cupcakes easily topple over even if I try to drive carefully. And only 12 standard cupcakes in each carrier? I'd need 2 or 3 of these carriers. The plus side is there's plenty of vertical room if you like to pile your frosting or decorations high on your cupcakes.I'll be selling this Wilton carrier at my next garage sale."
3,Could be better...,"I've had this 3-in-1 caddy for over a year now, and I loved it in the beginning, but now I find it somewhat lacking. I purchased it mostly for cupcakes, and wished I would have shopped around more before buying. The carrier is bulky and only holds 12 regular sized cupcakes. Additionally, the trays are not deep enough at all, so the cupcakes can easily tip over.I thought this was a really cool carrier for the 3-in-1 function, but haven't really used it for cakes (it would probably be great for that though). It is a very sturdy carrier, but now I will be shopping around for a better cupcake carrier -- one that holds more, with deeper trays."
2,"Sturdy, but too shallow to secure cupcakes","I bought this about two years ago and have tried using it a couple of times, but each time, I end up with cupcakes that have toppled over. I'm not sure what they were thinking, but the shallow sections for each cupcake - especially the mini cupcakes - just don't work. Cupcakes need something you can set them into. With divets this shallow, the cupcakes have no side support and end up falling over. Plus, this is a massive carrier for only holding 12 cupcakes. I would recommend another carrier with deeper holders more similar to what you'd find in a cardboard bakeshop box."
4,"Niece carrier, bur big and bulky for only 12 cupcakes","I got this as a gift for my husbands mother who likes to bake. I saw cupcake holders that could hold double the amt of cupcakes, but I am more familiar w/ the Wilton brand. She loved it, but the sad part was, she went to store it, and its pretty big for only holding 12 cupcakes, she wasn't able to fit it with her other baking trays and cookware. I only wish that it was smaller b/c its very tall for only 12 cupcakes. Thats the only problem. We haven't used it yet, but she was happy to get it. I am not sure how stable it is, and her only use will be for keeping cupcakes in her own home rather than putting them on a plate with plastic wrap or foil that would take the frosting off."
2,Only good for cakes.,This caddy is great for 9x13 cakes but cupcakes will tip over. The mini cupcakes I brought to my family Thanksgiving were ruined by the time we got to my sister's. The little edges aren't high enough to keep the cupcakes in place.
1,"Disappointing, a decorator's nightmare","This case is fine for protecting your baked goods in a home kitchen or refrigerator. It is almost useless for it's main selling point-transporting items between locations. As noted by other bakers, cupcakes do NOT stay put in the shallow cavities. My cupcakes (mini or full size) have not survived one trip in this disastrous design.In addition, the case is not high enough to accommodate cakes with multiple layers or tall frosting creations.I say we bring back cookies for classroom birthdays..."
3,Not great for cupcakes,This caddy is great for 9x13 cakes but cupcakes will tip over. The mini cupcakes I brought to my family Thanksgiving were ruined by the time we got to my sister's. The little edges aren't high enough to keep the cupcakes in place.
1,Cupcakes tip over too easily,"The first time I used this, I decided I would never use it for cupcakes again. The ""lip"" that holds each cupcake in place is so short that it doesn't keep the cupcakes from tipping. My pretty cupcakes were messed up!I WOULD use this if I needed to transport a sheetcake, though. The handle is comfortable and the latches are VERY secure. It's a great carrier, just not for cupcakes."
3,Not bad - not a dream come true,"I also had a cupcake spill due to the fact that the sides/holders for the cupcakes are not high enough. But, because they are low, I could cram some mini cupcakes onto the same area as the regular cupcakes. It is rather large and bulky, but it is easy to carry and I actually like how the sides clip to hold the lid. It would be great for a sheet cake, I think - mediocre for cupcakes."
2,Watch out if you have a side-by-side fridge!,"I picked up one of these because sometimes I need to transport 9x13 sheet cakes to work. This caddy will accommodate the sheet cake, but the holder overall is about half an inch too wide to fit into my side-by-side fridge!If they'd de-emphasized the curve on the short sides, all would have been fine. I'm not sure how many side-by-side fridges have the same measurements, but be forewarned about it if you make a lot of cakes that need to be refrigerated (I like to use whipped cream frosting on a lot of cakes).The cupcake holder is kind of silly as it only has spots for 12 cupcakes. Since when does anyone ever need to transport only 12 cupcakes? I picked up a different holder at the local outlet mall that holds 27 *and* will fit in the fridge, but I'll have to take some measurements before I buy a replacement holder for my 9x13 cakes..."
1,Horrible for Delivering of Cupcakes,"So I bought this w/out thinking. I was in need of a mini cupcake carrier. I bake mccakes to monthly wine tasting. the 3 things that this product is suppose to do is protect the cake items u caring and it doesn't. All the mmcakes do is fall over and get destroyed. It's still it great condition, but I've had it to long and don't have the receipt. Wilton, come on I thought you were better then that! I give it 0 stars, to continue I had to rate it."
2,Cupcakes easily fall over,I was excited to use this cupcake carrier. I bake ALOT and am bringing cupcakes often to parties. This carrier always causes my cupcakes to fall over. The slightest turn or bump in a car and they are on their side. I would not buy this again.
5,Great Product,This caddy is perfect for carrying baked items as well as other things. I really like the sturdiness of it and ease. We have used it several times and are quite pleased. Great investment!
2,okay for cakes not for cupcakes,"I agree with most other reviews - this is big, bulky and cupcakes fall all over the place. The plastic clasps broke almost immediately. I have to use duct tape to keep them on. For a 9 x 13 cake it works just fine."
5,LOVE IT!,Got it at $11 great price! Love this shade of purple and FANTASTIC cushion and non-slip for our hardwood floors. My old foam one was slipping all over the place when I did my Power Yoga! I should've gotten this ages ago. Comes with a tiny dvd too maybe my partner can try yoga now. I think all MY dvd's might be too hard for him but he has back problems...THIS MAT IS GREAT!
1,Horrible.. the worst yoga mat,"Received the mat today and opened it to do my home practice. It felt great until I jumped to take my first standing pose and found the mat was split and caught my toe. When it came to my downward facing dog, I thought strange this mat is short. Short is an understatement, I am 5'5"" and I could not have my head and feet on the mat when lying on my stomach.If you practice yoga, this is not a mat that you should buy!"
5,very good mat,"It works well. I do Yoga from time to time and it serves the Yoga purpose. Really not much more to say about a mat. Oh, no slippage."
2,Slippery Mat,"I like the thickness of this mat, but it doesn't have any stickiness to it. It's fine for some standing and seated poses, but my hands start to slip every time I move into wheel or downward dog. It seems unsafe, and it interrupts my focus."
3,"Great mat, but no DVD :(","I was really sold on buying this Yoga mat because of the short 15 min DVD that it comes with. Mine never came with one. I ordered it NEW from Amazon) It says in the product description that it comes with a mini DVD and even in the picture it shows the mini DVD. Now with my package it says "" includes free video download "" at such-and-such dot com. I love the mat, it's HUGE and comfy, but just unhappy about the mini DVD. :("
2,"Thin, no grip","This thin mat provides very little padding and is not at all sticky or grippy. I have ended up using it as a little bit of additional padding under my Jade travel mat (which is rubber, so is very grippy), but even then it doesn't add much in the way of comfort. Not impressed."
4,A good Start,"A good DVD for the begining navigator who wants to learn about the ""noon shot"". The first part goes over theory and calculations, with some humor thrown in. The second part goes into more depth with an actal situation and discusses sextant use, adjustment and care. With the info from this DVD one should be able to successfully take a ""noon shot"" of the sun and calculate where they are on earth."
4,Still Love Ours - a review of a 5 year old Philips TV/VCR Combo,"We own two of these little televisions. I can't quite remember when we bought them but it's been at least four years and we haven't any problems with them, despite the fact that they are used on a fairly constant basis -- one strictly by the children.One of them has been lugged (they aren't light) to vacation spots and even the hospital on one occasion. This same one has been used by our kids since the youngest was about three. The tape player has worked fine even though we have had to rescue a small car or two from inside it.The remote is also very sturdy.The only drawback is that the television is not equipped to work with satellite. So the kids use theirs for tapes and for video games. With the jacks in the front, it's easy for them to connect and disconnect. The other TV we use upstairs with a satellite box.Good product.Pam T~"
2,"lacks durability, not for young kids","We were very happy with this TV/VCR when we first received it. It was very easy to use and quite portable. But then after 2 weeks the play button on the front panel stopped working. A week later as I was getting ready to take it to the repair shop, my daughter stuck some crayons in the VCR slot. When I took it into the repair shop, the receptionist said not to worry about it, kids stick stuff in VCRs all the time and it's not that big a deal. Well the next day I got a call from the repair shop saying the unit was so badly damaged from the crayons that it couldn't be fixed. He said the power supply was blown, the gears broken, and a few other things. If we had bought a regular TV with a separate VCR, we would now at least still have the TV, but as it is we're back to being a single TV family."
4,A welcome retrospective of the franchise,"This DVD is a must for all Halloween fans. It offers a nice restrospective compilation of all the films, from members of the casts and crews to fans. It's chock full of goodies, just like your trusty Halloween candy bag from days of trick or treating."
4,"I've yet to see the content on this DVD, due to the fact it is yet to be released, but...","What I do know is this:1. It's not another special edition of the movie, ""Halloween"".2. The dvd will contain a documentary revolving around the entire series.3. The reason why this is going to be released is due to the fact that a new Halloween movie is in the process of being made. The film is supposed to be directed by Rob Zombie. The director says he wants to get a fresh start and revolve around the character of Michael Myers, instead of portraying him as the faceless killer.NOTE****I've yet to see the actual documentary. This review is for the sole purpose of helping you understand the content and reasoning of this DVD.I hope this was helpful to you. Thanks for your time."
1,OMGosh!,I canNOT STAND reissuing of the same movie over and over and over again!Get a life and go cut urself!
1,Pointless (includes spoiler),"Well, perhaps if I had read any other in the Crowner series, I might have previously developed some kind of empathy for the boorish, self-centered primary character. However, I believe a good book should be able to stand on its own, which this absolutely did not.After mulling through this entire story **SPOILER** the solution of the first (title) murder is casually tossed to the readers, with scant character development of the murderer or his motivation. And as for the more ""primary"" murder: you NEVER find out Who Dun It or Why!!!! Which might have been alright if there were any entertainment or educational value as it went along, but alas, there was not.Next time I hear that inner voice saying ""shut this book,"" I'll listen!"
5,"So Far, So Good","I just recently purchased this book after teaching myself to knit less than a month before. I really wanted to be able to knit socks and was obviously wanting to jump right in. I decided to get this book after reading other reviews here and I have to say that this book was a good choice for me. The directions are very clear and I am already halfway through my first pair of socks. I decided to make both socks at the same time so I haven't actually gotten to my first heel turn, but so far the directions have been so clear that I'm not really afraid of when I get to that point. I really like that the author first takes you through the different parts of the sock and has even knitted a sock in different colors to demonstrate the different parts. I also like that this books goes from very easy to progressively more difficult socks. There are about 20 (sorry I don't have the book in front of me at the moment) socks shown in this book, so I'm sure that I will be using it for a long time."
5,Knit Socks review,I have been very pleased with Knit Socks. I am learning to knit socks and has helpful write ups about knitting socks as well as patterns for socks. Ann Speedy
5,Good for a sock newbie,"This books assumes you have a basic knowledge of knitting and very little knowledge of knitting socks. That's what I wanted in a first sock book. There are explanations of each sock part, how to use double-pointed needles, and various other tidbits that might be useful to a first-time sock knitter. The instructions are set up step by step and are easy to follow.The only problem I had with my first pair of socks was the short row heel, but I re-read the author's section entitled ""You Can Do It!"" and realized her explanation of short rowing did make sense. You really do follow the pattern and it comes out looking like a heel.The patterns are lovely and fairly simple. There are patterns that would be a pleasant challenge to a sock newbie. If you're looking for more difficult patterns, this probably isn't the book for you. But, if you are new to knitting socks, this is a wonderful book."
2,Condition is questionable,"This book was listed as ""New"". Well, that is questionable. The front cover has a nick out of it and the binding is rough and wavy. It was going to be a gift, but I don't feel comfortable giving it. I am disappointed. This book should not have been listed a ""New"". If I wanted one that was ""Used"" I would have purchased a used copy."
2,Baffled by the gusset,"I am SO frustrated!! I read the reviews of this book and I ordered this book and thought ""Maybe THIS time I'll be able to sucessfully knit a sock."" But I am still baffled by the gusset. Only now I'm baffled by the gusset and $14.00 lighter. Oh well. I am now of the belief that I will only learn to knit a sock if some patiently sits down next to me and SHOWS me how to pick up the stitches in the gusset.Congratulations to all of you successful sock knitters. I am in awe of you all. The book is darling and the socks that I still can't knit are really cute.Sorry.Melissa White"
2,Nice to see something of his work in print...,...Though this song selection doesn't include any of his (1964-1980) chart hits.
4,"A fast paced novel, good for a rainy afternoon","Haddassah (Dossi for short) is a Jewish girl lives in a cramped apartment in New York City. Her sister (Ruthi) signs her up for a Fresh Air Fund which sends poor children too the country for 2 weeks in the summer. Dossi leaves excited and yet afraid to go on vacation with a family she doesn't know in Vermont for 2 weeks. She is stunned by things in the country and doesn't even know what fireflies are. This is one fault that I found with the book, she seems to know NOTHING of the country, now I can believe she's never milked a cow, but some of the things she had never seen are unbelievable. Anyway during the book she sprouts friendship and learns new things of her trip. She meets new people and learns what the lovely countryside is like. This is a really fast paced book, you should be able to finish it within an hour or so, but nonetheless it is worth reading."
3,DAMAGE SCREEN,"Texsport Wendover Screen ArborEasy assembly,very roomy. the complaint I have the screen wassnag through out the entire screen,the tent looks used. Buyer beware!!!!! You will need to buy a new screen. First instint was to return the item but,Family Reunion was in 4 days. HAD TO MAKE DO!!!!!"
5,A great find for people who miss the classic sound of Broadw,"I had the great fortune of seeing ""Carmelina"" on Broadway. It closed, not so much because it was a bad show (it wasn't), but because the producers didn't have enough money to keep it open until word of mouth spread around town. But luckily, the music was recorded, and if you like the lush sounds of great Broadway melodies, you'll love this album. It has wonderful music, great lyrics, combining to form tunes that make sense. Don't pass up this cast album! And if you like it, I would suggest you go out and look for ""The Baker's Wife,"" featuring Patti Lupon and Paul Sorvino. It's another lost classic."
2,Wal-mart is an evil empire?,"This book's purpose is to argue that Wal-mart is an evil empire. Fishman throws in some positive facts to try and seem neutral, but throughout the book he shows his socialist stripes and lack of understanding of basic economic principals.The sections of the book that I most enjoyed and found most interesting were the great in-depth anecdotes about companies that have a relationship with Wal-Mart.I had trouble finishing this book because his diatribe against Wal-Mart becomes more intense near the end, but at the same time his arguments have so many gaping holes. Those who understand basic economic principles will shake their head in disagreement many times as they turn the pages of this book.Overall, I feel quite dismayed because I think he will be successful in convincing many uninformed readers that Wal-Mart's impact is more harmful than beneficial."
2,Too repetitive unless you are a Wal-Mart acolyte,"Interesting overview within the first hour (9 CDs... yipes (9 hours)). I had to do a lot of ffwd (consumed as an audiobook) after that, as it was very repetitive information. If you are a fan of Wal-Mart or Sam Walton then this book is for you. If you want some interesting insight on what effect the largest company in the world has and could have then ""read"" the first hour or so - then ""fast forward"" to the end.The book drones on and on about store numbers, managers and the dogmatic, penny pinching lifestyles of Wal-Mart executives and their climb to the top."
4,"Wal-Mart, the store we love to hate","Fishman shines a harsh light on the mega-retailer, then focuses the reflected beam through a prism revealing subtle shades of influence that you probably haven't considered.Fishman's cool-headed assesment peels Wal-Mart apart like the proverbial onion, revealing its influence - good and bad - on our global economy and local community. While we generally think that we understand how Wal-Mart shapes consumers, Fishman shows how consumers reshape Wal-Mart on a daily basis. An objective reader might even finish the book with a begrudging admiration of the heartless Wal-Mart beast."
3,"Not too bad, i guess.","It is a bit boring to listen to. However, i hate Wal-Mart so much, that i can put up with it just to learn more and more about the disgusting behemoth sucking money from our pockets every way they can - including tax dollars. Don't forget that virtually every community they come into, they get some sort of tax break or concession....and ALSO remember the family members individually are among the top 6 BILLIONAIRES in the WORLD!"
5,"Insightful, scary and impressive","Charles Fishman has managed to both intrigue and scare me with The Wall-Mart Effect. This book is worth reading for anyone interested in the economy, corporate growth models, supply chain management, manufacturing or sales. Even those with no interest in any of those topics should read the book, just to understand why you SHOULD be interested in this company.Not being focused on traditional retail or physical product manufacturing in my daily life, the book was still able to get my mind racing with thoughts about how to work with or against the massive force that Wall-Mart exerts on all of us."
5,What I learned about Wal-Mart,Very well researched. The author was evenhanded in his work. The first part of the book was devoted to the innovations of the business model and of Sam Walton. The middle and later part of his book were devoted to the downside of his model. Fishman was never scathing in his critique.
4,Fine Objective Analysis,"This is a very good, even-handed analysis of the the WalMart effect on the economy from the local consumer to the globalized manufacturing of the products we consume ever day. It was well-written and easy to read.My main complaint is that the writer at times speaks of some of what we might call the company's evils in a most dispassionate manner. At the time of reading, this feels like he is implicitly condones the actions of the companies and its suppliers (even though its clear the suppliers have little option in going along with WalMart).Overall, I think the objectivity of the author plays a key part on the effectiveness of the book. His bias is in the pages, but they do not yell too loud. Anyone looking int the effect of late twentieth century capitalism on America would be well served to read this book."
3,Good Story about Business; bad economics,Great insight into Walmart and their suppliers. I liked the story about Snapper lawn equipment. He talks about how they can't compete on price. Then he talks about how they have an error rate of 33%. A of that rework and waste no wonder they have to charge more. The author's understanding of economics is very poor. You would think he read an econ book from the 1600s. He believes in mercantilism. But you cant blame him since a good portion of voters do to; in fact our president does as we.
2,Too repetitive - unless you are a Wal-Mart fan,"Interesting overview within the first hour (9 CDs... yipes (9 hours)). I had to do a lot of ffwd after that, as it was very repetitive information. If you are a fan of Wal-Mart or Sam Walton then this book is for you. If you want some interesting insight on what effect the largest company in the world has and could have then ""read"" the first hour or so.The writer drones on and on about details of stores with store numbers, manager names and the hard scrabble, dogmatic lifestyle of the Wal-Mart managers."
4,Very well researched book,"Wal-Mart is a company that is either loved or hated. Those who bought the stock when it went public and held on to it did extremely well. Those who had to compete against this giant did not do so well. I liked how this book not only portrayed the company's successful tactics, but also the negative ones that it has on our economy and small businesses.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
5,Read This Book Outloud!,"Ghost Sea is a great book just waiting to be read aloud. The chapters are a perfect length for oral presentation. The epitome of traditional storytelling, this book combines the sea tale, love story and ghost story with Pacific Northwest Native American history."
4,Thin but otherwise good envelope.,I used these envelopes to send out bridal shower invitations that I had made myself. My invitations were one piece of 8.5 x 11 paper cut in half and they fit perfectly in this envelope. They are self seal - so no licking! The only negative is they are a bit thin so you can slightly see what is inside.
5,Finally.,"You'd think it would be easy, but finding one of these babies that fits like it's supposed to and doesn't cost $100 is a chore. Saw this 2 pack on Amazon, ordered it, and they fit PERFECT. They are Carrier brand, and a 2 pack for $50 is a downright steal. Thanks Filter NOW!"
4,World in live,"Could you inform me whether you carry a full multisystem 110-220v SONY,SAMSUNG or PHILIPS tv/vcr combination (13 or 19"")?"
4,Trip Hop with rhythm,"Just moving my iTunes folders around, and onto a new PC and saw while looking for some cover art that this title was discontinued. Say it ain't so?! Well, good music is not always forever, I guess. This CD is one of the numerous alternative-trip-hop-electronica items in my playlist, and is a favorite. Great rhythms set this one apart. The music is hypnotic, and makes you move, and is one of those disks that are almost as much fun with the lights out and your eyes closed as it is when you're in a party mood. Worth picking up if this genre is a favorite of yours. I'll keep my copy, I guess."
3,San Francisco City Map - One try,"This map is in a handy format and it is water proofed. It contains 6 different maps, which show you different parts of the town. But the problem is, that the map doesn't show the busses and subway lines, just the cable car lines. It were really useful, because so you can use your cheap MUNI card for public transportation and your map to discover this great town.I would recommand the Let's Go Map, because the map shows you the public transportation."
4,"The BEST of the ""Olivia"" stories... wonderful and sad.","""A Candle for d'Artagnan"" brought the world of Paris durring the times of Louis XIII and Louis XIV to life.... the intrigue, plotting and politics of the time are facsinating.... and the chivalry and honor of the Musqueteers was well depicted. As always, Ms. Yarbro paints a wonderful picture of the time she is writing about.... it is as if you are there, along with the characters.The love and devotion of d'Artagnan for Olivia is profound.... the kind of love we all search for.A must read for all fans of Ms. Yarbro's books.... or anyone who loves a good vampire story!"
5,Admirable Olivia,"In A Candle for D'Artagnan, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro has provided Atta Olivia Clemens with her ultimate reward, a lover who embraces her life cheerfully, passionately and with respect. Yarbro borrows D'Artagnan, the unlettered Gascon hero of the Dumas Musketeer novels, and gives him a new stature as Olivia's ultimate partner. Dumas would have been proud, if he had recovered from his shock.It is a pleasure -- albeit a bittersweet one -- to read this best of the Olivia books and realize that if there had been no Count de Saint-Germain, one would still want to know this brave, wise woman who only incidentally has lived for centuries."
3,Everyone for themselves and Olivia for all!,"An Italian Queen, A French cardinal, a Gascon guard and a Roman vampire..Ironically, Olivia is pressed into diplomatic service..for the Church! A respectable Roman widow can hardly refuse a request from that source, so she sets up house at the French court and tries to inject a little vampirish long -sighted rationality into the political scene that wiped out all three Musketeers. Naturally, Dumas' great lover becomes Olivia's. Naturally, she hopes this is the one who will last..forever. Unfortunately, no mortal can ever be quite as heroic as a vampire with a mission..but they will try. Poor Olivia..poor St. Germain! (oh, Ms. Yarbro, why do crucial plot twists have to happen in a letter from offstage?) not as good as others in the series, but any book in the vampire chronicles is better than most.."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Olivia fancies the dashing muskeeteer captain D'Artagnan. They become lovers, but he is not that amazingly keen on the vampire thing really, and she ends up deciding not to force the issue, being a pretty decent sort of undead lady, all things considered.This ends things for them."
1,Possibly the most boring book I have ever read.,"........ (The reviewer has unfortunately fallen into a comotose state due to the exceptionally tedious, dull, unimaginative plot and characters in this book.)"
5,Outstanding Jewish Cinderella,"This is a Jewish version of the Cinderella story. Far better than the original in my opinion, because instead of something as random as shoe size, the key to discovering the heart-stealer is her riddle and her wisdom. This book stresses the importance of learning and is a wonderful romance at the same time. Beautiful!"
1,Cheap Price = Cheap Product,"The old adage is true...you really do get what you pay for. After 5 short months the tape sensor went bad on this unit, trapping a cassette inside and rendering the device useless. Labor cost would be almost as much as I paid for this although the part is warranty. My advise is to spend a little more for a more reliable machine."
1,down with Philips,I just want to say that 2 and a half years ago I bought another Philips-Magnavox VCR (model VRX242AT) which broke down last month. I think 2 and a half years is just not enough. I will never buy Philips again.
1,Rollers don't work,"Rollers don't pick up paper, I sent this back three times to get fixed and it broke after printing less than 10 pictures each time. Search the web and you'll find this is a common problem with this printer - not worth the effort."
2,"good printer, lousy ribbon","the pictures that this printer creates is amazing. they are clear, don't smudge and it was really easy to set up and use. however, the color ribbon that it comes with, only lasts for like 10 prints. and then you have to put in a new one, which only lasts like 10 prints. made my deal that I got on this printer suddenly not worth it. wish I would have known that before opening it."
1,prints only half a page,This printer is not working properly - printing only half a page. I spent too much time trying to make this work but to no avail. I'll return it.
4,A great book but published sloppily,"This book defines a connection game and proceeds to analyze them. About half the book is a catalog of all the connection games that have been invented, most in the past 20 years. I had no idea there were so many. This book will give you a taste of all these games and how they are ""connected"". It also presents ways of analyzing connection games, and has some tips on playing. Still, this is not a book that will tell you how to win at Hex, I think the author has another book for this.My big gripe was that all of the page numbers in this book in the Table of Contents and the Indexes (there are several) are off by 13. My book came with a short note on a separate piece of paper noting this error. I found it frustrating looking things up in the indexes, although you soon become pretty good at converting. For a fairly expensive book, this is rather sloppy publishing, and should have been caught."
3,Good Overview,"If you liked this author's book on funny cars, you'll like this one. On the other hand, if you didn't enjoy the funny car book, pass this one by because it's very similar conceptually. It is a fine overview with superlative photography. My only criticism is that Genat should've spent more of the book on the classic front-engined dragsters of the 1960's. What's there is great....just not enough of it for me. But for a neophyte, it's a great book."
3,Not bad...,"Ok. Long-time Nylons fan here. First off, the group has never been as good as it was when Paul Cooper was a member. That coupled with the untimely death of Marc Connors has caused me to approach their newer albums with a degree of trepidation. I most definitely did not like the albums that were not acapella. (Because and Harmony.) The fact that this is a Nylons Christmas album that is indeed acapella, scored points with me. While some of the songs are for the most part traditional arrangements, this is ok. Christmas songs should sound a certain way in my opinion. All in all, it's a nice addition to either a Christmas collection or an acapella collection. I certainly enjoyed it."
1,A Wish For You (I wish for you not to waste your money!),"This was a truly laughable effort and I was terribly disappointed. All of the songs sound the same, and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other mediocre a capella groups. They have nothing original to add to the genre, save the final track which manages to provide the biggest, though most unintentional laugh of all. A quasi-new age piece of Christmas drivel that sounds like a poor impression of Barry White. I could not even force myself to listen to each song in it's entirety, so desperate was I to find something of quality on the album. For a truly worthy album please purchase Rockapella's newest Christmas album and listen to Barry and the boys as they show you how it's done!"
5,"""MY FAVORITE"" NEW AGE CD!","This was one of the first, and still the favorite, of my ""New Age"" collection. ALL of the songs are wonderful, yet each is uniquely different, unlike much of the other music of this type out today. The titles of the songs are very descriptive of their musical content....so when you close your eyes and listen to ""Ruminations of a Pensive Camel"", that camel will plod right into your head.This CD has thundering bass, as well as lilting flute. The music envelopes you in such a way that you feel tranquil, yet invigorated, all at the same time! I have listened to this CD repeatedly and I never tire of it!I did not consider Greg's first CD to be as good as this one, but this one is excellent and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, they both seem to be nearly out of print....I can only hope that he comes out with a third one soon!"
4,"Buy the new edition titled ""Planting Missional Churches""","Though this is a great book in its own right, Stetzer has published an updated edition under a new title, ""Planting Missional Churches."""
3,No change,"Didn't really notice anything fancy with this stuff. No tingle as mentioned, hasn't really done anything more for my skin than neutrogena's basic acne stuff. This bottle will last you a long time though, if you use it twice a week as they recommend. I'd guess almost 6 months."
1,Not the whole truth,"The title alone should have told me enough not to look any further. The deep grief that our society is suffering, both in women who have had abortions and those loved ones around them, is profound and too important to be treated with an ideological lockstep approach. As someone who as a young person sat by and watched as my older sister had an abortion, I know that there is more to it than ""choice;"" this touches many people. This book doesn't take into account the whole reality of abortion's effects on the whole fragile fabric of family and friends. Regardless of whether you think abortion is right or wrong, our society is suffering and ideological books such as this ultimately hurt women. Get 'Forbidden Grief' for a truely wholistic approach and response to this gaping wound in our society."
1,I agree with the last reviewer,"I couldn't agree more. Twenty-two years after mine, I still grieve, regret and count how old the child would be. I look at children (young adult now) of the age he or she would have been and never, ever forget that I am missing a life. All because of pressures. I wanted that child. I still do. Did the author have one? Because as mentioned, not everyone considers it over. I will never."
5,Good Book,This is a good book on emotional recovery after an abortion. I was helped by the book. I also derived an extreme amount of comfort from the book An Encounter with a Prophet. Althougt the latter book deals with much more than recovery after an abortion it was most helpful to me and I hope it helps you to.
5,A BOOK FOR ALL AGES,"At sixteen I had my first abortion and at seventeen my second. This book brought me back to the days of my abortion and made me remember how scared I was and how I never want to do this again. I couldn't put it down I wanted to do all the exercises in one night but with moderation this book can heal pain, and also guilty feelings. By the end of the book I felt like I had really done something for myself and not some hideous thing. This book related to everything I was feeling at 18 years old. It is a must read for any young girl or woman who has experienced this procedure."
1,No Heart,"With the exception of about seven songs on the three CD's most of the songs, including MORE - the one I bought the CD for, did not have much heart. It is almost as though these recordings of Sinatra are mechanical - certainly not the best of his stuff. I wouldn't spend the money again for this CD set."
3,It makes me itchy in the dry day.,"My friend recommended this for me, because it is alcohol free. I used it for about a year. The liquid feels like a water without any fragrant. It was fine at first, but sometime if my skin becomes too dry, I felt pain or itchy when I put on it. Probably, it is better for oily skin as my friend not dry skin as me."
4,Received what I wanted,This text was purchased for my daughter. We got what we wanted within a decent amount of time.
2,Mixed feelings,"The Barron's book has some strengths, which include a good vocabulary section and helpful tactics for high school students to review prior to taking the SAT. It also has some weaknesses. The most significant of these is that the sample tests don't exactly match the format of the actual SAT. As the teacher of an SAT Prep course, I believe that it would be much more beneficial for high school students to take practice tests that duplicate the actual test format in its entirety."
1,Terribly different from the new SAT!,"The practice tests are terrible! I have taken the new SAT in March 2005, and the practice tests in barron are so different from the real new SAT. The real one has 10 sections, but barron has only 7 or 8; the longest sections on the real take 25 minutes, but those of barron can be as long as 30 minutes!My advise is not to buy this book, it is very misleading. I tried Priceton Review's Cracking the New SAT, that one is close to the real SAT, although it is slightly more difficult.By the way, same problem with Peterson's New SAT practice book."
4,It's a mediocre book,"On one hand, this book gives you a lot of tips and strategies. On the other hand, its' tests are poorly made. They are packed with errors and repetitions. So, my advice is to buy a used version and save money to buy an Official SAT Study Guide."
3,READ BEFORE ORDERING,"Here is the missing information you need before ordering: Max depth is 14.5"" and max width is 24.5"" wide with one set of 4. Alternatively, you could line them all in a row to cover a space 13"" deep by a max width of 27.5"".Update: Areas where two plates overlap creates a cold spot for cooking. Overlap should be minimized for best results."
5,grill-pro adjustable heat-plate,"I have been using the Grill-Pro adjustable heat plates,#92350,for a number of years now. They will fit just about any size grill tub and last for at least 2 to 5 years depending on how often you clean them. I highly recommend these plates over lava rock as they keep grease flare-ups to a minimum and don't absorb any grease that could leave a foul taste the food being prepared. Pricing is reasonable and they arrived ahead of schedule."
3,Smaller than I expected,Good product quality. Make sure you measure your BBQ before you buy - this was smaller than I had expected.
5,GOOD product-- but excellent custoimer service!!!!!!,SIMM supply will make it right for its' customer. I commend them for doing a follow up on my order! Thank you.
4,Delta Shopmaster Miter Saw Stand-A Fine Work Shop addition,I bought this miter saw stand to use in installing crowm molding and baseboard at my daughters home. As there was no work area there this stand set up nicely in the garage and instead of crouching on the floor to make these cuts I was able to do the job quickly and comfortably. It's now in my basement shop and it is a terrific additon. At the price you really can't go wrong. Also the assembly is very easy and the assembled stand is very easy to transport in the folded position.
4,"So far, so good","So far, so good. I haven't had a chance to use the stand very much yet, but I believe I'm really going to like it. I'm even thinking of getting another one to mount my router table on. There may be better stands out there, but for the price I think this is a really good deal."
5,This is a powerful book.,"I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. It's so well-written that you forget that it's a novel and not really a diary. Kristin's observations on her family, her friends and the 70's are insightful, often highly entertaining, and at times, heartbreaking. There were so many things in this book that touched me; Kristin's intelligence and individualism, the politics of the time - seen through her eyes, and the richness of the characters. By the end of the book I felt as if I had lived through it all with them.This book is listed as being appropriate for ages 12 and over but I think that anyone who was ever 14 would love it and anyone who lived through the 70's would be impressed with how well the feel of the time is conveyed."
5,The Star is Really Kelly Easton,"Kelly Easton is my hero. I wish I could be like her. Her books rock, like totally! YEAHHhhhhh!"
3,Life History of a Star,"This book is about a girl named Kristen. She has severe problems with her personal life. This is basically a diary that she wrote about her life. What will happen when her brother in a coma dies? What will she write about? Read on and find out!I liked this book because I could relate to it a lot. Another reason I liked this book was beacuse it was an excellent experience to read about her life and problems.I recommend this book to girls who are iterested in journals, that can relate, and also who like to read about personal experiences.I give it 3 stars!"
5,"It actually does what it says, woohoo!","This product does what it promises, and does it well, for very little money. How often do you find that? I'm a beauty product skeptic, having tried almost everything, only to come back to the basics time and time again. Recently I've been having trouble getting my water-resistant mascara off, as well as getting the goop out of my pores now that it's summer and I'm sweating more. I remembered using Clean & Clear as a teenager, and the bottle said it would remove waterproof makeup. So I bought it, tried it, and to my amazement it removed every speck of makeup from my face, including the mascara that usually settles under my eyes. It didn't sting or overdry, just removed my foundation and eye makeup without harsh wrinkle-inducing scrubbing. Let's hear it for truth in advertising."
2,The Best Thing Is The Price,"I was quite disappointed with this product, and had it not been for the price after rebate, I would have certainly returned it. For a beginner, this program can easily be overwhelming, especially in the most important feature which is the ""immersion environment."" The speech pronunciation guide is a farce. I had a native of Puerto Rico listen to the female voice and she said unequivocally that it was terrible. The program gave my native speaker friend poor pronunciation grades--even when she tried over and over again. Much of the program is not intuitive. The details are not worked out well. An example is the bookmark feature which supposedly allows you to start back where you would like. No--you have to go through each and every bookmark you've made before getting to the last bookmark--and you can't name the bookmarks. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea. I'm still struggling with it, but it is painful."
2,Berlitz too complex,You have to read a long manual before you can figure out how to use this Berlitz Spanish program on computer. I got so frustrated that I went out and bought a Spanish book.The only thing I like about the Berlitz program is the flash cards.
1,buyer beware,"Berlitz Spanish Premier (Win/Mac)Actually, I don't know if I like this software or not. It won't open on my MacBook. No advice on the trouble shooting page and no answer to my email request for technical help. Mac user be very wary."
2,Might be discouraging for the beginers,"Material and CD set is quite comprehensive but for beginners I would expect to start with basic language skills such as teaching ABC, basic words etc. But I guess that's what you get for that price. I would go with more hand-on lab vs. this type of learning solution."
4,Berlitz Spanish Premiere,"I was so excited to try out Berlitz Spanish Premier. It comes with 4 audio CDs. The program has many interesting components. I liked the flashcards and the speech analysis. You can also practice your Spanish on your Ipod or your car radio...a definite plus. Another thing I liked in this ""day of print your own manuals"", this program came with a printed manual with over 200 pages. A beginner really needs to sit down with the manual and read it first. I found this software to be a great way to spruce up your Spanish skills but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has no background in Spanish. I did like there was a six month money back guarantee. You can't get better than that."
5,Berlitz Spanish Premier,"Good product. I like the multiple learning channels that come included in the package. Interactive, audio, mp3, ""flash cards."" There is plenty of opportunity to have the opportunity to learn wherever you happen to be. This product was recommended to me -- and I would recommend it to others."
3,Simple Macintosh installation,"For effortless installation on Mac just follow the instructions described by M. Sheperd on 2008-09-08. (Thanks a lot for this simple and very helpful tip.)Trouble Installing Berlitz on a MacI too had issues installing on a Mac. What worked for me was to click and drag the installation icon onto my desktop, and then run the install from the icon on my desktop. Then go to you applications (programmes) folder and voila."
3,Using it for a child,"This is a great porgram. I was wanting to learn Spanish to speak with my husband who is bi-lingual and also wanting it to help my 7 year old daughter learn spanish. She really enjoys doing the computer program. I do wish they used more pictures and that you could stop where you want and not only after each section. It is a good program and she we are really learning. I love the extra cds you get to also listen to when you are not near your computer.*This review was posted by a member of the Nova Development UserCommunity (NDUC).

4,Pretty Good Product,"The Berlitz Spanish is actually fun. I just popped it into the computer and my kids and I had fun learning Spanish. It is pretty easy to catch onto. It did go a little fast especially for the kids and there were some words I couldn't understand how to sound them out. It isn't bad if you take the time to listen and learn. On a scale of 1-10 I would give it an 8.*This review was posted by a member of the Nova Development User Community (NDUC).

4,Gets the job done,"The program is easy to use and seems to be working as my kids are retaining the Spanish they are learning. I did have to sit with my son at first to help him figure out the program, but once I did, he was able to do it himself without help. We have been listening to the CDs in the car and we are picking up new words and phrases. Overall I am happy with it as it is accomplishing my goal--for my kids and me to learn basic Spanish.*This review was posted by a member of the Nova Development User Community (NDUC).

5,Big help for my family's cats,"I first tried this product on the advice of a friend who has studied a fair bit on pet nutrition. My cat was having urinary problems and this seemed to help alleviate them a bit more than medication alone. More recently my parents' cat was having stomach troubles, and I gave them some of what I had left over to try. She's doing great on it and they insisted I order some more."
2,Typical Chinese Quality,"The nose piece was lop-sided, had to do some serious bending to make it comfortable. Ray Bans made in China, what is happening to this country? The quality is typical of Chinese made junk. Not worth the $90, at least I did not pay full retail. RAY BAN CORPORATE - ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION!!!"
3,Wonderful item but watch the rubber temple covers,"This is a very nice looking and protective eyeglass. Highly recommended for the look and performance.One drawback, the rubber cover of the temples slip and fall off the frame. My wife lost one of them after 4 days of use. I ended up ordering the rubber covers but that took a while and some follow ups.My recommendation if you buy this item, slip the rubber covers out yourself and apply very thin layer of glue (Never use quick glue but rather rubber glue) and insert the rubber temple covers again. This wil make them resist slipping out.I would have given it 5 stars unless I faced this problem."
1,"Made in China, Not Italy","I've had a pair of Ray-Ban SIDESTREET sunglasses for a couple of years and have been very happy with them. I ordered a new pair with darker lenses for those bright sunny summer days, but was surprised when the glasses arrived and I discovered they were made in China, not Italy. The quality is noticeably inferior to my Italian made pair, with hinges that do not operate smoothly and misaligned printing on the temples. The glasses are usable, but I don't believe they offer the quality commensurate with Ray-Ban's premium pricing."
4,Great sunglas accept,Great sunglas I like the design but a bit disappointed it made from china. I'm not saying china is bad but if it made from Italy it look more cool even ppl around don't care we're it made from :p
3,frank review,"Nice style. Very wide so good for folks with wide faces like me, not sure how they would look on a thinner face. The nose fixture is in line of sight all the time - bit annoying. The lens color is a bit light but I expected this. Would have preferred a darker color. Its easy to see through from the outside to your eyes. Very light weight glasses. Overall good, just if yuo're looking for something dark I would give these a miss. Good value for $ though."
2,The rubber temple covers will start to disintegrate within a year,"Read O. Itani's review and then come back to this one - the little protective ear covers (the ear socks, the rubber temple covers - whatever you call them) are the problem for me. If you manage not to lose them, they will start to tear and disintegrate after about a year. Poorly made ear covers make this a 2-star pair. I love the look and feel of the design + lenses but to screw up two of the four points of contact with my head makes this a 2-star review."
1,Sun glasses,I received an empty Ray Ban box from this shipper. I did call Amazon and they immediately helped me.I would not order from this shipper again. It was a Christmas present and I am glad I opened the box beforewrapping it.
3,Nice sunglasses but . . .,"Love the style, just not for larger heads. This was the second pair of Ray-Bans I had ordered from the same company but had to return them both for the same reason.They were too small."
3,More Descriptions for Products,"Good shipping, description was not as accurate and so I didn't get the Polarized pair as I was looking for."
2,Fake from Sunglass Express,"I ordered RB 3183 Sun-glass from Sunglass Express and I was totally disappointed to receive a product made in China. In their pictures in the product description it shows Made in Italy, but delivered a different product. I paid 114 US$ to buy a fake product. Buyers please be careful about this. If you really want to buy a real product, please get the confirmation first from any seller before ordering."
3,cool,"wonderful just check the size, small fit's small facesthe bad thing was i found a small scratch on the lens from out side."
1,"It's OK, nothing special","Tiny cuts of jerky. Ummmmm, it's OK, but the old fashion rough cut/torn jerk is WAAAAY better.This just appears and feels over-processed. And what ""type"" of meat is it, specifically? We do not know? What level or ""quality"" level is the meat, we do not know.We'll not buy this again.We bought a dehumidifier and make our own at a small fraction of the cost, and it SO much better!"
1,down with Philips,I just want to say that 2 and a half years ago I bought another Philips-Magnavox VCR (model VRX242AT) which broke down last month. I think 2 and a half years is just not enough. It had a number of other inconveniences as well. I will never buy Philips again.
4,An unusual memoir,"I must begin by leveling with you -- the previous reviewer apparently has never read the book. This is a memoir of an African-American woman. It is unusual in that it is a memoir of the white men who have come (and some gone) from her life, some of whom shaped her life significantly, some of whom frightened her terribly, and some of whom she loves dearly. This was an enjoyable read for me, a white woman. And Ms. King -- guess what? A white man bought the book for me!"
1,Again this looks more substantial in the photo,I rate this a 1 star due to the price and the quickness my dog can work through this rawhide.
5,Great Bone!,"We have a female yellow lab who LOVES to chew. (Or maybe I should say destroy.) She powers through the typical store-bought rawhide bones in anywhere from 30-60 minutes, depending on the size, so I was pleasantly surprised with this wonderful bone! Daisy has been chewing on it for over a week, and she has barely gnawed a small corner off of one knotted end. When she tires of it (because she can't destroy it), we just put a small smear of peanut butter into one of the crannies and she goes to town for another hour or so. I highly recommend this bone and I will definitely buy more of these for my own dog!"
4,"solid, attractive shelter","I used this unit ten days straight, subjecting it to windy rainstorms and late-May Florida bugs and heat and it performed nicely. With the exception of one seam leak, the unit was reliably protective and sturdy. One of my camping neighbors even asked me where he could get one like it."
2,"incorrect product description re. fine ""no see um"" mesh","The product description of this screen arbor reads ""fine mesh to screen out insects as small as no-see-ums"" and I bought it specifically for that reason. However the mesh is not fine with holes of about 1 x 2 mm. This will keep out mosquitoes, but not ""no-see-um"" sandflies or black flies. Otherwise a well built screen tent."
2,"No, no-see-um mesh",The whole reason I get a screen tent every year is so I can enjoy the evenings outside without getting eaten by the black flies and no-see-ums. This one is not going to work. Mesh is big enough to throw a cat through.
3,Screen Arbor,"I purchased this to be a place to go in the event of rain while camping. We set it up with great ease Friday night and used it a few times throughout the weekend. It did its job and seemed to be a good purchase, until the steel ends of two of the poles that cross the top just came apart during disassembly. This happened the very first time we used it. I am now very leary of this product."
3,OK Screen tent for the money,I gave this product a three because of the materials. This screen tent is made of fairly cheap materials. It would not stand up to any severe weather. Also I think the zippers on the doors will end up ripping after a few uses. the first time using it was on a camping trip and we ended up with severe rain the first night. Of course it was not meant to be waterproof so everything inside got wet but that was to be expected.The good points to it are the ease of setting it up and it's size. It took me and my wife less than 15 minutes to get it set up.If you buy this for shade and to keep the bugs out and you use it in normal weather it will work OK for you. But this is definitely not something you will be able to set up and leave it up all summer.
1,Absolutely Awful,"Never have I been so disappointed in a product. I was so excited when it came to find that it was lightweight, easy to set up, roomy, and shady. I loved the design with the screens attached. BUT, after not even two hours in low/moderate wind, one of the roof poles literally shredded in to pieces and one of the legs snapped. Yes, snapped in half.If you're going to use this product in sunny, perfect weather, then there's nothing wrong with it. But, it can't stand up to ANY little tiny bit of bad weather, so be prepared."
4,Great Screen Room,I have used this screen room for 1 camping season. It has withstood some serious winds without any problems. It does take a little time to put together but well worth it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the mesh seems to run quite a bit. Nothing that can't be fixed but a little unsightly.
1,Large holes in screen after two days,"Put it up for the first time last week. After the first two days of sunny, calm weather I discovered a large hole in the corner of the screen and several large rips in the mesh. A waste of money. If you're going to spend the money on an arbor buy one that is better made!"
1,Awful,"Someone in our bookclub suggested this book. I found it terrible. Why do we need to read about people engaging in immoral and criminal behavior? Why do our young, black authors continuously think this is entertainment?I have no idea if Ms. Holmes can actually write - I was put off by the book's degrading language and plot. I recommend this to no one."
5,KISMET coast2coast,"This book has it all, and is chalked full of my fav... DRAMA! the unique around the way style of writing will have you unable to put it down. This book is a page turner to say the least!"
5,kudos to you Meisha!,"This book was an excellent read! I could not put it down. I am one to read reviews before I decide to purchase, however I never write them. The book has so many twists and turns and ups and downs. I cannot wait until the next book comes out. PLEASE HURRY UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,You Gotta Love It,"I really enjoyed reading this book. To be Ms. Holmes first book, WOW, I can only imagine the second or third. It reminds me of several great movies combined in one book. Keep writing good books Ms. Holmes, you have found your true talent and career."
4,A Must Get!!!!,Meisha.....You did a wonderful job on your first novel. The suspense was outrageous because it makes you want to know what was going to happen next. I can not wait until you finish your other books so I can read them as well. Keep doing what you do best and keep writing great novels.
4,U GO GIRL! from Great Lakes IL,"Ms. Holmes did a great job with her first book. Brooklyn Jewelry Exchange drew me in with page after page of anticipation of what was to come. I could not stop talking about it to my family and friends. I loved it. I am looking forward to reading her next book. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend this book to all my fly friends. I would like to thank my girl Shamona who brought this book for me for Christmas. Meisha, keep up the good work.Tonya Moore"
4,Dreaming in My Living Room,"Ahhh, Garrin Benfield. His new album is filled with insights so personal and intimately relevant that their content rises from this core and grabs hold of a truly universal space that speaks to a much broader human experience. The quality of the recording is such that it's almost like having Garrin and his band playing live in my living room, but (sadly) without his sweet visage, sweat and leather pants. Into the Mistic..."
5,Excellent buy!,"I use this polish on my boots for the police academy. Excellent product does what it says, and is totally worth the money. Only downside is that once the can of polish is opened, it can't be resealed, so just throw some tinfoil over it and it wont dry up. Applicator pad works as does the shine cloth, gives an excellent shine if applied properly, and lasts for a long time."
2,Had to pawn it.,It was sorta reliable. It was worth about 40$ in my opinion. It shot powerful inaccurate shots like a real desert eagle. Fully detailed and realistic. But only after about 300 shots with it. It broke down internally and would be more to repair than to buy a new one. So I'll end up pawning it.
1,Listen to me,i get guns from 40 to 170 dollars and i got this for my friend. Dont get this it wont shoot and it fell apart ill give a listgood stuff.nothingBad stuffbreakshas to charge after u shoot like 4 by charge i mean give it a break or it will mak a annoying sound and wont shootfeels badcant shoot more then 29 feethorrible hop up curves so much u aim 20 feet away what u want to hitfps is alot worse then what it saysi wont by this for more then 4 dollars only cause i could take it apert and try to remake it. otherwise 1 dollar.cant even use it better to throw the bb'si dont know how any one will give this more then one star sice i would give it -1 stars which i never wanted to do beforedont get it even if u just want to shot around cause u cant
4,Jack Link's Turkey Jerkey,"This is an excellent product. Great for the busy schedule & excellent protein, however it is a little pricy."
5,My All Time Favorite Album!,"This album is simply amazing! A Gospel-boasting Webb shares life stories and in some places intros his songs with mini-sermons that are all inspiringly great! I desperately miss this Derek Webb, who has more recently become experimental with his sound and seemingly more interested in the shock value of his lyrics than conveying this type of deep, moving, beautiful music. Every song is fantastic, Lover is my favorite song ever. I honestly love this album, I've been listening to it for years, and you will never regret buying it and sharing it with everyone you meet."
4,Excellent Mix Of Goth And Death,"I hadn't heard any of the earlier GODGORY works, so I was a bit skeptical when i decided to buy this CD. It was a worthy buy. I assure you. Believe It Or Not, This band has only two members: A drummer and a vocalist. All the additional music has been delivered by guest or session musicians and they have done a wonderful job. Acoustic and Heavy rhythms have been mixed to the point of perfection with a smooth finish. Standout tracks include ""Resurrection"" and ""Adultery"" (My personal favourite). Apart from atmospheric sounds, GODGORY also succeeds on creating heavy, rip-roaring death metal music like ""Crimson Snow"" with twisted lyrics. No matter what you hear about this CD, If you like nice, slow, acoustic music and also heavy, goth-death, then this CD is definately for you. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. I would give it 4-1/2 Stars."
5,Excellant piece of the show,EXCELLANT!! This picture was used in several episodes this season. Great idea to make it the cover for the CD. And to feature our very own: Haley James Scott! Great tunes for just about any occasion
4,ONE TREE HILL: FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS,"I have been looking for a copy here in Manila for months but failed to found one. So i finally decided to buy at Amazon.com. after 3 weeks, it arrived, and it feels good!! the wait is so worth it!The CD didn't look like it traveled half way around the world. It was like I just bought it today from a Music store nearby.The album is awesome.. the songs are really good! My favorite is HALO by Haley Scott, who is one of the main characters in the Show.Also knowing that some of the proceeds go to a Cancer Foundation makes it more worth of your money..."
4,Some stand out tracks!,"Great mix of some under-the-radar tracks from talented artists. Standout: Gavin Degraw's acoustic version of ""Jealous Guy""- if you've ever heard him live in concert you'll be jumping for joy to finally have this song! Also recommend ""The Mixed Tape"" (especially with Spring/Summer right around the corner). Might not be for everyone, but DEFINITELY worth checking out!!"
1,one tree hill disapointing,"outside of ""hallo"" I was disapointed in the songs selected and performed on the cd were not the best choices"
5,Even Better Then the First One,"Once again, a big success! This CD provides an excellent arrangement of artists and bands. Even better, it's for a good cause! The creation of this CD was so unique in that the whole CD was created on the show. I really enjoyed how each song carried such a resemblance to a particular character or scene."
4,Great varity of musice,I love this CD. I got this after watching the one tree hill episode with the promotion. I love it.
4,Love Bethany Joy's music,"I bought this CD because I am a huge fan of Bethany Joy. I was pleased with the other songs and would rate that part of the CD a '3.' As for Halo by Bethany Joy, I give that a 5+ which averages out to 4 for the whole CD-lol. I just can't wait for BJ's solo CD to come out. Based on the few songs that I've heard from the CD, I know it will be fantastic."
2,Let's Be Honest,"This book has a religious orientation that is not revealed until you open it and start reading. I have no objections to religion for those who choose it, however, I resent the ""hidden agenda"" aspect of this book. If I had known in advance this was a religion-based book, I would not have bought it. I think that's the idea behind their keeping quiet about it."
2,Would not purchase again.........,Does not record temperature accurately or consistently. At times there is no outside temperature showing.The screen will be blank. Sometimes the inside temperature isn't shown. The time cannot be set. It will show the new accurate time programmed but always returns to original time shown when received.
2,"Works, kind of...","When the unit works, it seems ok, but quite often I can't get the main unit to find the outdoor reading. The display also has a very narrow viewing angle."
1,White bread and mayo,"Like white bread and mayonnaise, this CD has no Brazilian flavor whatsoever. These songs are examples of Jobim works devoid of the essential Jobim. Don't waste your money."
2,Died just one day after warranty,"It was a good deal until it died today... just one day and one year after the purchase! No signal when I pressed the power button, not even the noise of fans! The only reason I could think of is the excessive hot weather today, which is over 100 in the room where I put this desktop. But a PC is supposed to just power off under excessive high temperature and then recovery when it cools down!"
2,"Ran fast, failed fast, still waiting on repair.","Bought this in the late fall. Really liked the performance, but in mid January it failed to even do the power on self test (POST). Spent an hour on the phone to support before they would tell me what I already knew... it had to go back to HP for repair. Estimate was 10 days to get it back. Then got an email saying they were waiting on a part and the new time estimate is closer to a month. Needless to say I'm not too happy."
4,very entertaining,"even though Viva doesnt name names its very easy to see who is who in this tell all. Very entertaining, and funny and sometimes dirty. A very fast and easy read."
2,not practical,"I ordered this book and perused it and realized it was more of what I already know just from reading magazine articles in Parenting and kids' magazines along with Sugar Busters. It is very much geared toward families with older kids (8+) who have been consuming tons of sugar and reasons to get them not to. I am looking for recipes and ways to make sugar-free foods for my beginning children, ages 1 and 3. So if your kids are that age or you're looking for recipes or helpful suggestions, this is not the book you're looking for."
2,Sugar for Processed Meats???,"I totally agree with cutting out sugar in our lives and in our children. However I was very turned off my her push for adding extra meats and fast food choices. Replacing sugary snacks with hamburgers, hot dogs and lunch meats in not a resolution!! These foods have very bad additives in them as well. Taking sugar out of your diet to replace them with other unhealthy foods is not going to heal your children!! She doesn't mention that eating so much meat and dairy is loaded with saturated fats! So lets replace the sugar addiction with heart disease and heart attacks????"
2,Not what I had hoped for at all,"The author used a lot of words but didn't seem to say a whole lot....while I'm with her on sugar being bad, she doesn't give many reasons as to how or why it's bad. I think it would have been helpful to have some of the statistics I have read in other books about the toll it takes on your health. Basically the book says to very gradually phase out sugar and give your kids lots of protein, which is another problem I have. It puts an unbalanced emphasis on protein needs. She recommends some foods that aren't healthy in the sake of getting protein in (is she aware of some of the health issues associated with too much protein?). Protein shouldn't be the focus, it should be healthy eating with no sugar. I was very disappointed overall with the whole thing and it was rather a waste of time reading it."
4,Helpful advice,"I am a sugar addict and so is my young son. I have read some of the author's other books (Potatoes not Prozac and Sugar Addicts Recovery) and I believe this one is the most helpful. It offers lots of practical tips and advice on how to help your children (and yourself) reduce the amount of sugar and white carbs eaten. I like that the steps are laid out in an easy to follow method. There is a section of recipes at the end that are healthy alternatives to favorite foods. Though I haven't tried any yet, they look easy to make and good to eat."
3,Eh,"They kinda went the wrong direction with this one. I miss the harmonies they had going on ""secret american living rooms"". Nothing really catchy on this one. They went from having a sound that was their own on that cd to all the songs sounding alike on this one in my opinion."
4,Non-Medical Person Reads Book on Babies,"As soon as my wife got pregnant, the deluge of books started coming in for her. I was shocked at the huggy-feel-good nurture your baby books. All of them have the tone of how to have a baby for dummies. I wanted some real science, unfiltered and without the emotional crap. In my research for a book that would tell me the details of human development I happened on this book.I really liked this book.As a layman it was a good place for me to go back and review all the biology that I learned many years ago. It was also good to know what all the measurements, blood tests, and various poking and prodding all meant. Having some of a science background it was a good overview of the whole process. Knowing the various complications at different parts of the pregnancy was also good to know.If you're squeamish about looking at dead babies with a variety of birth defects you should probably not read this book."
2,Wish I had bought Moore's Embryo Instead,"I'm currently using this book in my 1st year of medical school. I feel it is not well organized, user friendly or as in depth as is needed for medical education. Moore's illustrations and explanations are much more helpful. I wish I would have bought that intially. Please save yourself the headache and buy something, anything other than this book."
1,impossible to learn from,"This is probably the worst science textbook I've ever used. An avalanche of facts are presented with little or no connection or motivation. I have spent hours trying to decipher a single page, and the figures are often confusing instead of clarifying. On top of it all, the English writing is terrible (the book starts with a sentence fragment: ""From a single cell to a baby in 9 months.""), and is replete with errors.One gets the sense that someone has condensed a much longer book into the current version, leaving out the parts that connect and make sense of the minutiae. If you have a choice, use Carlson's Human Embryology and Developmental Biology or Moore & Persaud."
3,Buy it for Simbryo and as a reference,"This book is our text for Embryo. You can learn just using it, I guess, but only if you don't place much value on your time. You are much better getting a copy of lippincott BRS embryo, reading that to understand the concepts, using the included Simbryo CD to reinforce them (Simbryo is excellent!), then reading Langman for detail/additional reinforcement. The book is terse and poorly organized, but it provides good detail that you probably won't get elsewhere. Use it, but don't expect to learn from it efficiently unless it's augmented by a detailed lecture or some other material."
2,Brief,"I am not too fond of Langman's. It is brief, meaning that you will get a statement of facts but won't necessarily get an explanation or a logical correlation or an in-depth explanation of the processes. Just facts. The pictures are pretty good but it could definitely use some more."
2,Not recommended at all.,"I'm a first year medical student and our school (unfortunately) clumps embryology in with Gross Anatomy. I hated every second of the embryology portion because the book was disappointing. The professors did their best to explain things, but if there was an area that I didn't quite understand, the book was no help. It threw me into so much detail and had way too many errors. I would recommend a high-yield embryology book or some other review. Way way way way way too detailed for the time that we have. Not recommended. (...)"
4,Great!,"The book was in great condition, just as advertised. It was, however, missing the CD-ROM in the back. But the book was shipped right away and got to me very quickly. Overall, very happy."
1,Completely unorganized,"Beyond the chapter headings, the material is very disorganized and hard to follow. Embryology is a very difficult topic to learn as is. I found that this text's ""back and forth"" flashback style writing made it even worse. The graphics are wonderful, but not attached to the relevant pages....Sometimes the critical points arent even labeled. Waste of money.I quit using the book mid semester and found many other solid resources on medical school course sites (UNSW, Indiana, Duke, Univ Fribourg, McGill)"
1,A textbook for those who already know embroyology,"This book is confusing to say the least. Terms are not defined and processes are not clearly explained. Trying to read this without wikipedia by your side is impossible. Begging the question, why not just read for wikipedia for free?"
1,junk,arrived in a timely manner scratched on the outside and broken on the inside...two small screws that held it all together fell out the bottom and rendered it useless...returned product and am waiting for a refund!!
5,Tin Cans are amazing.,"There is no other book on the market like ""The Fine Art of the Tin Can."" It offers artists, makers and craftspeople excellent examples of art and craft made from tin cans.Some people may appreciate the fabrication examples in the book so that you can learn some ""insider tips"" for working with very difficult and challenging materials - recycled tin cans. Bobby Hansson, the author offers a number of simple projects that would be easy to replicate with some basic tools and rudimentary skills.The book offers a wide spectrum of examples from a simple pendant to complex and elaborate work. Bobby Hansson is a real ""character"" that loves tin cans. You can sense his passion for the material in the book. The photos are all excellent and the printing is top quality.In the effort for full disclosure, my art work is on the cover and inside the book. It is an honor to be included in this wonderful and delightful book.[...]"
5,Great buy,"This is a very good value and the reseller is attentive. Received the first one in a battered box and found the foot to be broken. Reseller facilitated return and replacement.Pros: Pretty much as expected and an excellent value for the price. Effectively about 1/2 price for approximately the same product.Cons: It's a grade ""B"" product but a fantastic deal for the price. You will not notice any adverse quality issues with normal use and placement. It could benefit from a light diffuser below the bulbs but it's not an issue if placed just behind the line of sight of the seated user.Perfect for our house and likely will be for yours as well."
3,Very honest and open with her infertility struggles,"I was able to read Ms lee's book in 2 hours. I did not read every little detail, I found all the indepth journalling to be more than I wanted to know, but it highlighted her struggles and determination to have a baby. I did not find it helpful per se. IMO it is the kind of book that is best shared with family and friends who know you personally. A great book for her to share with her son one day..."
5,"A touching, sensitive, emotional story","Wow, what some women go through to have a baby. This author tells of her journey through hell and back. This book will show a womans strength when the maternial instinct to have a baby is there. For others trying to conceive, you will see yourself in this book and feel the connection. You'll laugh and cry before the last page is turned."
4,A must have book for fans of the English Rose,This lovely little book is an indispensible addition to any rose lover's library. Small enough to take with you to your local nursery and yet has enough detail to be very informative. Some newer English Roses not covered.
2,L'immoraliste,Complicated structure. Was difficult to read even at the advanced level. Very depressing story.
4,Perfect,This was exactly what I was looking for though it would be nice if it was bedazzled a bit with some more photos of the actual text or depections. The perfect compliment to my practice.
2,Read the fine print,"Read the small print on the DVD cover - if you already own Neighborhood Animals and Baby MacDonald - do not bother getting this DVD. I thought Animals Around Me would contain new material, but most of it is identical to the aforementioned videos, which we already own. Unfortunately, my children quickly became bored with this video after one viewing. I am disappointed that Baby Einstein developed such a misleading product!!! If a video is being released as ""new"", then it should contain all NEW content and footage. The only thing that is new is the format. Very disappointing."
4,"Important, Worthwhile, Skimpy","If you're looking for a detailed review, look elsewhere. This IS an important, well done three part ""docu-drama"" that is well acted.This review is added solely to point out that the ""extras"" are deplorably skimpy. The mini-""documentaries"" aren't worth a lot (though what Ossie Davis has to say is interesting). One of the most significant figures in modern American history and we get this? The film itself deserves 5 stars. One star is deducted because this DVD could and should have been a far more profound teaching tool about King, the Civil Rights Movement and not only where we've come from but where we need to go from here."
1,do not buy dvds from this seller if you live in australia,The dvd was configured for use in america only which is not much use in australia unless you buy a special machine
3,King,This movie is really really really old it was a B movie not high quality the actors were all horrible but did like the story line learned alot of things I did not know before watching this movie like how Martin met his wife
2,School Success!,"My friend at school and I are in the hiding biz together as partners. We've hiden all of our secret stuff in the ideas in the book, and we even got some ideas from the books internet site."
5,I love this book,I realyy love S.H.P. it kicks but i can hide stuff from my older bro. and he will never find them.Last month my girlfriend wrote me a letter and it was like 11 pages long and i would read it bit by bit at night and then hide it in my secret wall under my bed it is there now!TIM B.
5,Secret Hiding Places by Mark Shulman,Secret Hiding Places for Clever kids is a book by Mark Shulman. He writes books for children and adults. This book is small so you can hide it in your cds and it looks like another cd. The writer tells you about the ways you can look arund your house and see secret hiding places. You can read about making a box with a secret bottom. You can read about passing notes to your freinds in school. You can read about how to keep your brother or your sister away from your diary or your favorite toys. You can read about making a map and keeping all your hidden stuff oganized. You can read about hiding the book in all your cds so nobody can find it. You can read about the secret hiding places.com web site that is lots of fun too. I really like the book. I think you will too. You will like reading and learning about secret hiding places. You will feel like a clever kid even if your old! I will give it five stars on Amazon.com. Thank you. Violet G.
5,What kid wouldn't want this book?,This guy thought of everything! Forget the great hiding places. Never mind the intricate thoughts about passing notes (I'm glad I wasn't this guy's teacher). It isn't even the vaults you make that look so natural. It's the writing. It's a funny book. He has a dry sense of humour and a quick way with words. The writer knows kids. And his secrethidingplaces.com web site is pretty funny too. Even the legal notices! I can't wait for the next book.
5,the best book!,I made the secret hiding spot under my drawer and no one ever found it one time my mom was putting my close away and she didnt even notice and I made the Hanger upper with an old pair of blue jeans. I bought this book because my big brother is aleays snooping around looking for my journal. I think thisis truley the best book ever written!
5,Outstanding,"This is a must for any Janis Siegel fan. Of her recent recordings, this one is the most complete and inspired. The arrangments are fresh and full of life while at the same time familiar. Janis' style really comes through on this cd."
5,"Janis sings, ""Baby I want to bake your bread."" She does.","This CD has the style and appeal that will cross generations. Great, moving music for all of us."
3,Standard Trap,"Get a set of seasoned pros to back you up,a set of oft done standards,a good label,producer and put your money (and your voice) on it.Sadly, in jazz the whole is not always as good as the sum of its parts.The good part of this album is the rhythm section.Hersch is fresh and inventive.Victor Lewis is his tasteful self and who said Hank Crawford is stiff!!Janis Siegels' tone is unsuited to this kind of music.Contrary to popular belief its most challenging to do standard standards and come off with the listener wanting more.Janis admittedly works hard and looks pretty on the cover but that does not a good album make."
4,That Old Black Magic,"Janis Siegel has the range and style to manage almost any type of music, but when she blows sweet and low on a jazz cut there is something magical goin' on. On this underproduced CD Janis doen't get a chance to show her stuff. There's nothing wrong and if you haven't heard Janis when she wails then you won't be dissappointed, but if you've listened to At Home it will break your heart. The Tender Trap is a flashback to an earlier time when singers and sound never really came into contact. Buy this if you've been listening to Diana Krall or Karrin Allyson, you'll be amazed. If you have heard Ann Hampton Callaway, Stacey Kent or Janis Siegel it will be a little ordinary."
1,Avoid this like the plague- get the Henry Fonda version,Length:: 1:43 MinsMy first video review of anything.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000E8NJ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5,"i'm stealin, to be your one in a million....","....or at least write a nice review.continuing on, from their humble beginnings as a [mostly] two-piece band, the lassie foundation write another masterpiece in 'pacifico.'the instrumentation is wonderful, often engineered and mixed by andy prickett or 'the doc,' and produced by the foundation themselves.wayne everett's [fernandez's..haha, nevermind] vocals are beutiful over waves of reverbed guitars and drivng sounds provided by newcomer and NON-singer jeff shroeder and his wah pedal. campuzano's guitars are amazing again, jason pickersgil [or jason 71 as he goes by] compliments the guitars nicely with his fine bass-work, and frank lenz makes himself heard by providing the back beat on the traps.i recommend this album to anyone with ears."
3,Possessed Exploration,"I really like some of the songs, but there's nothing brilliant here. Average early 70's hard rock. Deffinately nothing dark enough to warrant the name Possessed. The band is at their strongest on opening cut Darkness, Darkness, the slide inflected rock'n'roll of Reminiscing and Climb The Wooden Hills, and the funky I See The Light, but off key vocals spoil the mood. This band should've avoided the attempt at getting jazzy, too. They simply don't have the chops. I still get some enjoyment out of this disc, but it's nothing to get excited about."
2,Aabra Jabra Kadabra,This item works well as long as you are in sight of the IPOD. Even by placing the IPOD in my pocket or backpack the signal fades and gets choppy. I guess I was expecting to much. I'll will not recommend
3,"For the money, it is good!",It is a good product. I personally did not like that the only way to charge it is using the USB port on the computer. It works well if you charge every day.
3,"Good Product, however not impressed","I gotta say, Jabra poorly designed this adapter. One major thing they overlooked while designing this product is a lock. There is one on the USB iPod charger to lock it in place so that it doesn't slide out. Well Jabra blindly overlooked this little detail. So beware, the adapter won't stay connected to your ipod at all times, in addition to that there's no case either. Other than that I works perfectly, and the pairing with the headphone is fast and easy."
2,It's alright.,"The product is not exactly what I expected. It does connect easily and well, but it's hard to charge because of the need to use a computer for it. It also does NOT stay in well and will fall out very easily. The connectivity goes out all the time if you slightly nudge it.I would not recommend this product."
2,keeps loosing connection,"The A125s doesn't work well with the iPhone. The connection to the headset Jabra BT620s is very choppy and uneven. iPhone, iTouch and iPod were not designed to work with stereo bluetooth headsets, that's all."
1,Very difficult to use,"I used it with multiple iPod models and had trouble with it every time. I'm surprised at how difficult it is to connect it and keep it connected. With bluetooth installed on the new models, I don't see much use for this product anymore. For my older iPods, I'll just use headphones. This product offers no convenience."
4,Great little accessory for iPod,If you have an iPod and good bluetooth stereo headphones this is the ticket. This sounds great due to the A2D2 type protocol.
3,"Works well, really bulky","This product works well with the 5G iPod, and although it is really bulky and does not fit with the Contour case, it has good sound quality."
4,Jabra A125s Bluetooth iPod Adapter,I purchased the Jabra A125s Bluetooth iPod Adapter along with the Jabra BT620s Bluetooth Headphone and have enjoyed both. They were easy to set up and since they are both from the same manufacturer they both use the same charger so I do not have any extra ones to worry about and I always have a spare to take with me when I am gone for long periods of time.The only suggestions that I would have would be for a positive connection to my iTouch; as it is now it is too easy to wiggle out just enough so that the connection is not good and I have to push it back in.Of course this only happens when I am walking it works great when I am just lounging around listening to tunes.
5,Hearing Aid + Ipod + Blue tooth adapter,"Easy to use. I use this with my oticon hearing aids, but you have to pair the hearing aid streamer before the Jabra. Until I learned that, I had frustration, but really like the product."
3,Ipod adapter,"It works, but the signal is easily disconnected with movement. So jogging or working out will likely result in music interuptions and pauses. It works with the iPhone and permits control of iPhone music and is compatible with the cell phone use thereof."
4,Great for non-bluetooth iPods,"The Good: I've used this for two years and never had a problem with it. I've used it on my all my iPods and the iPod Touch with an AD2P link with my old Motorola cellular phone.The Bad: Someone runs a microwave in the building and you are there, the music stops and starts repeatedly until the microwave stops or you walk away. Doesn't fit well with the iPod Touch or iPhone models. You need rubber bands to hold them in.Note that you don't need this for iPhone 3G after Summer. So if you haven't purchased it yet to use the headset and iPod features, don't bother buying it."
5,"""Pheromones"" rocks.","I first heard the song ""Bundy"" on IMF and had to check out more by this Norwegian rock group. They also have some of the songs from ""Pheromones"" on their MySpace. I finally got a hold of this album and it is just incredible. I can't believe this is their debut album.Singer Agnete Kjlsrud's voice manages to be gently melodious like she's singing you a lullaby, growling like she'll rip you to shreds, lovably insane, screechy and screaming, and sensual. Many times all of these in the same song! Every track is a gem and catchy in its own way, whether it's the frentic ""Bundy"" or the calmer ""Remember The Day"" (which is the last track and the perfect way to end this CD).All the songs flow together beautifully, unlike other CDs where a song or two may feel out of place and you need to skip around. Stick this one in your player and play with confidence. ""Phermones"" will have you listening to it over and over again."
3,"All Hail, Holy Burrito","A comprehensive guide to one of California's greatest inventions was long overdue. This fanciful book is filled with burrito secrets that will charm the serious afficianado. Like the authors, I've spent years seeking out the ""perfect"" burrito; an elusive culinary holy grail. This is not a cookbook, but rather tries to explain the appeal of a food that is at once exceedingly simple and yet layered with complexity. Bon appetit!"
1,Do Not - Do NOT waste your time,"This is, without a doubt, the worst travelogue I have ever seen. Beyond his egomaniacal ramblings, beyond his stale jokes that merely betray a profound insecurity about a land and culture he knows nothing about (nor truly wants to investigate), I was saddened to see such a trainwreck put forth by PBS, who should know better. I was saddened that this is the face the honorable people of this beautiful part of Italy - the producers, winemakers, artisans and citizens of Tuscany - were forced to share time with in public viewing. Mr. Guerrasio may have a career elsewhere, and I wish him well there - just stay away from anything remotely related to travel, food, or wine."
1,Worst out of any Joe Cocker collection don't bother!,"This one has got to be awful give it a rest. Enough releases already of Joe Cocker's compilations he's already got 4 CD collection albums with ""Greatest Hits"", ""Classics Volume 4"", ""The Best of"" from Capitol label recording and last his ""Anthology"". So anyway hear me out don't get Super Hits it's a cheap waste of time pretty low budget investment to ever come out on a different record label such as Sony for buying and to own instead!"
5,Christmas gift for Husband,"My husband is an artist and he is so fired up about this book. All he keeps saying is that he is so happy to have it. He felt that the photography was very well done, not like some other reviews."
2,"After the Atlantic Article, I expected better...","I read a write-up on Coben in the latest version of the Atlantic, and he was made out to be a very nice guy, and a great writer of thrillers. I'm sure the first is perfectly true, but I'll have to take the second on faith, as this was fairly underwhelming - too convoluted in some places, too many ""puppet strings"" showing in others. I'll try another Coben, but this time I'l get it from the library..."
1,May be your cup of tea but not mine,"I have had it with the Myron Bolitar series. Our intrepid hero is a grown man who lives at home in the basement of his parent's house. His best friend is a psycho who loves to hurt people and film himself making love to nameless women. His secretary is a frightful ex-wrestler who loves kinky sex. His ex-secretary is also a female ex-wrestler who is described as bisexual but only has affairs with women. She, in a previous novel was caught having an affair with a client's wife and was rewarded by being made a partner when she should have been fired. Aside from the characters, there is little to recommend in the plotting or the writing. However, apparently some people like this sort of thing."
2,Harlan no reader,"I've heard good things about this man's books for some time now and after seeing a number of good reviews for PROMISE ME (the book) I thought I'd try the audio version. I was very disappointed unfortunately. I hadn't noted he was the reader when I loaded them in to my car stereo and started to listen but I didn't get very far into the discs before I ejected them in dismay. He's just not a very good performer, I'm sorry to say. This is a performance medium (audio books) and the book rides on the shoulders of the performer. In trying to sort out the performance from the plot/story, I can't say as I was that impressed by the latter either but will admit, I might have given the more neutral tone of the printed book more of a chance. It was painful (sorry, HC) listening to the audio version."
2,Very disappointing,"I am a big fan of the Bolitar series, but I was tremendously disappointed in this installment. I realize that Mr. Coben had stepped away from the characters for a while, but I almost didn't recognize them in this book. One of the nice things about book characters is that, unlike us, they don't have to age in real time, they don't have to endure the same challenges that we do, and because of them remaining essentially the same, they can be a refuge for us readers. They suffer, they have their hardships, and they change in essentially minor ways. But they are always recognizable and comfortable to come back to. I didn't like where these characters were taken and it made a sparse plot even harder to enjoy. I never give book details in my reviews and I won't start now, but I will say that I didn't like who these characters (some of my favorites in all of this genre) had become. It felt to me that I was being shown the final chapters in this series and that saddened me."
4,Well Worth Your Time,"My first Coben novel & surely not my last. The author leaves the gate running, as he wastes no time in creating the suspense. The ending has a good twist to it & one is pretty unsuspecting as to how this novel will come to a close. The body of the work is very well written with small chapters. The entire novel is peppered with tongue in cheek dry humor as told by the main character. Some of the characters are pushing the envelope in their believe-ability. I'll go 4 stars for that reason"
4,The hero has a 3 point shot!,"Reintroducing Myron Bolitar, the ex professional athlete who uses his agility and intellect to surive, creates a fast-moving mystery. Myron, who always seems plagued by Jewish guilt, makes promises that turn out be to treacherous. At the onset of the novel, he makes a promise, keeps his promise and then manically redeems himself for the promise and his loyalty. The interplay between the mother, who has a missing child, Myron and the husband has right-on dialogue. I liked the book, did not thnk it is oben's best, but the ending, which I would never reveal is worth the time you spend."
4,4 1/2 stars,This is the first 'Myron Bolitar' novel I've read. I did enjoy the cast of this novel and Harlan Coben came through with his typical fast-paced writing style. I've read his previous three novels and really enjoyed those. I don't think this one came off as well only because I've not read any previous Bolitar novels. Still a quality and entertaining story.
2,PROMISE ME you won't narrate any more audiobooks!!,I'm a HUGE Myron Bolitar fan. Especially as read in every Harlen Coben audiobook but this one. I've purchased them all but may not continue with this particular book due to the author's audio-rendition of his own novel. It's horrible.The writing is so-so but I'd love to know why Coben resorted to reading this. If it was the first one I'd listened to I would never have listened to another.
2,My first & last Myron Bolivar story --,"It isn't thrilling. Myron makes his share of stupid mistakes that get him into hot water, but he has this invincible (and creepy) friend Win, who we all know will bail him out before any serious damage is done. Coben's psychopaths just don't have the juice and his damsels don't make a good case for being rescued. No character, no danger, no thrill."
3,Promise Me You'll Do Better,"I read Promise Me in a little over a day. After having read some other of Harlan Coben's work, I was less enchanted with this one. I had not read any from the Myron Bolitar series before, and after this one, I probably won't read another one.The characters are somewhat flat. The mystery is a little tangled and there are some clues that are held from the reader until the end. Not typical of Coben's work.There are some redeeming qualities in Promise Me. Bolitar's smart alec comments are sometimes entertaining. As some of the mystery unravels, the way the clues are presented is pretty clever. There are a few red herrings that are, while easily identifiable, well thought out.Promise Me is OK. No more, no less. It was good enough to hold my attention until I was through with it. But it's not The Woods."
2,The Promise Me Saga,I am a huge fan of Harlan Coben and especially the Myron Bolitar series. I have all of them in audio format. I can't begin to tell you how disappointing this book is because of the narrator. I realize he is narrating his own book but he needs to stick to writing. His narration killed the book for me. It was a major disappointment.
3,"It's true, folks, the audio is atrocious","As a major fan of Coben's, I am very disappointed to know that he talks like the guy who used to do my yardwork until I had to fire him for sheer ignorance.As to plot, pacing, and sudden turns, Promise Me is as good as any by this author. But the dialogue becomes painful in Coben's reading.It's time the publishers paid more attention to the quality of the audio versions of their books: a good reading will improve a book (e.g. On Beauty by Zadie Smith), but a bad one like this can seriously impair the overall experience of the book."
3,Book on CD,"This review is specifically for the book on CD. I have always enjoyed Harlan Coben's books on cd but am having a hard time listening to this one. The reason? The reader, who incidentally is Harlan Coben! Coben is a very good writer and what he needs to stick too. I will tough through this one but anyone who is an avid book on cd listener will tell you the reader is critcal to keep the reader involved in the story and in this respect Harlan Coben is just not cutting it."
2,Big Disappointment,"In a very short review, I was sorry to see Myron Bolitarrevived. Not even close to Coben's previous novels."
5,More Myron Please!,"Myron Bolitar books are awesome. It was a little wierd with him being 40 years old, but this is another solid Myron book. 5 stars!"
3,Good Book!,"""I have read all the Myron Bolitar books and enjoyed them immensely.However, although, all the great characters are in it, this is not his normal escapade. There are no sports figures being framed for murder or dying for that matter.This is just a great mystery with Myron stuck in the middle, accidentally. Have tissue handy because this one could cause eye leakage."""
4,"Glad I Discovered Coben and Bolitar-Good, Very, Very Good","Friends have been trying to get me to read Harlan Coben for years. Finally did it, and man, am I glad I did! This guy (Coben)is good and his protagonist (Bolitar) is even better..good stuff, can't wait to read the whole Bolitar series...this book is a quick, easy and fascinating read...unusual twist at the end, but I understand that is part of reading and loving Coben...Myron Bolitar ranks rank up there with Mitch Rapp (Vince Flynn) and John Corey (Nelson DeMille) ..different genres perhaps, but every bit as good..every bit as good.....""Promise Me"" keeps moving on every page and keeps you moving right along with it."
2,"Mr. Coben, please don't do the audio for any more of your own books.","This is probably a good story, as most of Coben's are; however, the audio version is in a word booooring. Mr. Coben reads way too fast, with way too much of a NY accident in a monotone with absolutely no inflection. It's difficult to gain any connection with any of the characters let alone the story.Please, Mr. Coben, don't do any more of your own audio versions."
5,Can't put it down...,"Just started reading it two days ago, but stayed up way too late reading last night, already at page 264. It really is a page turner, that keeps you guessing. Several interesting subplots and good character development."
2,Please Let Jonathan Marosz Read,"Loved the first 7 Myron Bolitar books on CD. The readings of Jonathan Marosz were Wonderful. Then I got to book 8 - read by the author. PLEASE Harlan - stick to what you do best. You do the writing, let Jonathan do the reading. This reading by the author was a big snore - after the first CD unabridged, I opted for an abridged version just to get to the end sooner."
2,Weak Link,"First, I have always thought that Coben's stand-alone novels are stronger than his Myron Bolitar series. Second, the Publishers Weekly blurb identifies Bolitar as ""the former Boston Celtics basketball star."" It makes me wonder if the blurb writer has read any of the books. Bolitar was a Duke basketball star, signed by the Celtics, but who had his knee destroyed (a story in its own right) before he played any regular season basketball for the Celtics. Third, Coben's reading, contrary to the PW blurb, is distracting and underscores the weaknesses of the book. Coben reads too fast in narrative sections, so that he almost stumbles over his own words. In addition, his voices are awful. His women's voices sound like a bad transvestite, and his men's voices all sound like the cartoon character Goofy. The novel has the usual baker's dozen of plot twists, but this time around it's just not engaging."
3,"let's hope Harlan ""promises"" not to write another like this one..","'Promise Me' by Harlan Coben is something of a mystery novel that feels as if it were written in haste. It seems very derivative to a great many mystery novels one would find on supermarket shelves. Missing persons, paranoia and mayhem in suburbia, and colorful action heroes are all found within this book. Oh, and we cannot forgot the many intricate twists in the end! To all this I say ""bah!"". Harlan Coben has written better, and his fans deserve better.Bottom line: let's hope next time Mr Coben doesn't phone in his next novel to his publisher. Not recommended."
3,Engrossing and entertaining with obnoxious characters,"I've read most of Harlan Coben's ""Myron Bolitar"" books and always find them engrossing and entertaining. I also find virtually all the characters, including the principal character Myron Bolitar, to be obnoxious and annoying (with the exception of the character ""Win""). I don't understand how I can enjoy the story while finding the characters obnoxious, but there it is."
4,Great Bolitar Addition,This episode leaves at a great point in the series and makes one hunger for even more Myron. A great read.
4,Harlan always on target,"I have been reading and enjoying Mr. Coben's books for some time now and I found Promise Me to live up to all of my expectations. The story has the right amount of humor, suspense and action to keep me interested from start to finish. This is typical of his books and is the primary reason I enjoy them. The storyline is very good and the ending excellent."
2,NOT HIS BEST WORK!!!,"This book was just okay!!!! This was my first Myron book but have read his other books and enjoyed them. This book flowed but the plot sucked and the book wasn't suspenseful, you could see where the story was going and the end was just stupid. Personally I wouldn't recommend this particular book."
2,Too much juggling.,"Fans of Myron Bolitar (me included) wanted to catch up with what has been going on in his life. However, Mr. Coben tries to put it all in one book; this is an example of too much information and not enough explanation. New and past relationships are mixed right along with several past characters, who make unsatisfactory cameo appearances. Add to this a plot which isn't as tight as Mr Coben's other books. There were too many balls in the air, and a few were dropped."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable!!,"The nuances of whether you have read one of this particular series or not are a bit lost on me.I have read several of the author's books before, although not one of THIS series and I am well aware of what he can deliver and insofar as I was concerned he made a 24 hour period where I was laid up a bit with some minor back issues very entertaining.The story flows right off the pages and as others have detailed the plot quite well I see no reason to reinvent the wheel in that regard.The characters are strong, the dialogue well written, the mystery of the missing girls is well presented and the reader is drawn along on a very well done piece of story telling in a rather seamless fashion.What's not to like about that??"
2,annoying,"The plot is OK but not as good as it used to be, the delivery of the story is extremely annoying."
3,Promise Me,"I have been a big Harlan Coben fan the past several years, reading & enjoying each of his books. Promise Me was a disappointing read and I didn't feel it was up to Coben's previous standards. The ending was far too predictable and the excitement of his previous books was missing. He has definitely written much better books than this one!"
3,Slow starter,I am not real familar with with Coben's books. It sounded interesting so I tried it. I wasn't grabbed with suspense at the begining but it got better. I would try one his books again.
3,a light summer read,"This is a good Harlan Coben page turner. There are more characters and interesting subplots than other Cobin books I have read, which was good. I really liked this until I got near the end. The ending is disappointing - not especially interesting, nor something I had any chance at figuring out. Still, if you're you looking for a fast, easy summer read, this might be for you."
4,A Bolitar best,Coben seems re-energized with his Myron character in this new novel. One of his best. If you liked the earlier novels in this series you will like this one.
1,Don't waste your time!,This is my first time reading Coben and I have to tell you I won't be coming back! What a waste of time and money. I am an avid reader and always searching for a new author so I was looking forward to adding Harlan Coben to my list of favorites after reading some of the reviews here but what a disappointment! I am totally baffled by the good reviews! I am beginning to think these are all his personal friends and relatives pumping him. Not worth it at all!
3,"Not your usual Myron Bolitar, but not bad either","So it's a risk to do a hybrid of a recurring character and your other stuff. That's what Harlan Coben has done here and the same qualities that carry his other work generally carry this one. The plotting is not as intricate as his typical non-Myron work and it's not as much fun as his typical Myron work; but ear-true dialog helps things along. The action sequences occasionally require more verbal choreography than he provides. But, all in all, a nice diversion."
5,Myron hits a big Three Pointer,"I must admit that I was a little disappointed when I realized that PROMISE ME featured Myron Bolitar. Not because I didn't like the Bolitar novels (I did) but because I liked his standalone thrillers so much and I was hoping for more of them.But after reading it, I realized that this was basically one of his standalones with Myron as the main character. I thought the plotting was as intricate and as tight as anything Coben's done before. I was comfortable returning to Myron and Win and the rest of the gang, and was glad to see that in 6 years they have actually changed a bit. Win's a little more mellow; Myron's a little more grown up. Not too much, though, that would be no fun at all.Maybe it's just that I'm so close to having finished this novel, but I think this is one of Coben's best, combining much loved and enjoyed characters with the writing/plotting style of his thrillers."
2,I never got past the third chapter of the Audo Book.,"I purchased this audio book for a road trip. What a waste! I'm sure the story is pretty good since I've read Harlan Coben's books before. But the narration was truly awful. Slurred sentences, skipped words. Indecipherable to the point where I had to replay chapters just to figure out who is who.Don't know if Mr. Coben was trying to save $$ by narrating his own book, but I'd highly recommend that he hire Scott Brick or Len Cariou to do his narration in the future. These guys narrate for DeMille, Baldacci and Patterson."
2,Title misleading -- be sure you know what you are ordering,"The title (in the Amazon catalog) is a little misleading. Be sure you know what you are ordering. This book is actually a copy of William Wynn Westcott's familiar translation of the Sepher Yetzirah, including his translation of the 32 Paths of Wisdom. It then also contains the Hebrew Text of the S.Y. (Kalisch's edition). What it does NOT include -- and my entire reason for ordering the book -- is the Hebrew original of ""The 32 Paths of Wisdom."" This was a huge disappointment to me, having sought for many years for a current published version of it. Nonetheless, if you know what you are getting, the book is a fine buy at a fair price. You can't get a copy of Westcott's translation much cheaper. The manufacturing, though simple, is adequate (good quality paper, folded and stapled). The Hebrew text of the S.Y. is only otherwise available to most people through Kaplan's volume, and this may be a preferable source for it."
1,Stinks,"This stuff really smells bad...like burning hair. It makes your skin smell that way afterwards and I couldn't get the smell out of my nose for days. The hair stays gone for only one day and like the other reviewer stated, it doesn't get everything. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours."
4,smooth ass chris,"this stuff works... i am a HAIRY MATHA... USED IT ON MY BACK AND HAIRY ASS...LOL WORKS. DOES SMELL BAD AND MAY IRRITATE YOUR SKIN FOR A DAY OR SO AFTER, BUY MY BOTTOM IS AS SMOOTH AS THE DAY I WAS BORN!!"
4,good product with one flaw,"This is a good cream. It does remove the hair when you follow the directions. The only prblem is that if you leave it on for a little too long, it might irritate your skin and make you break out."
1,Horrible,This is a horrible book - it is a reproduction and the copy is too light in many places to read. I should have listened to the first reviewer but instead I decided to risk it. Big mistake. It's not worth the money - you should download it free and print it out yourself on archive.org.
5,Dvorak #9,Bravo as the label says. My favorite rendition and great interpretation. Virtuosity at its best. Sonic quality of recording is way up there. You'll love it.
3,Now Extremely Dated,"This was an excellent book, but now many of the figures are outdated. Written before 9/11 and when oil was less than $15 a barrel. Aircraft types, fleet mixes, costs of ownership and flight crew costs have all altered. Utilization figures and APM and RPM are all changed now. Its nice to know what TWA fleet costs were perhaps but the book really needs an updated edition."
5,tv shows,love this showI like how it always seems to keep me on the edge of my seat. I'm planning on re-watching the entire series soon.
5,dont have a subject.,My granddaughter and I love the mystery of this program and have watched it since the very first airing. Love it.
5,For the Young,"It is clean entertainment for the young, no murders, no sex, no drugs. It is not an Emmy award contender, just entertainment"
3,Good if you ignore the acting...,"Horrible acting but an interesting plot line. The story is alright, especially for teens, but the acting is sub par at best. If you can get past the cliche characters and awful acting the episodes are quite cool."
4,another good one from Freireich,"Even more welcome than an engaging, well-written science fiction novel is a depiction of matriarchy that neither resorts to stereotype or to a happy happy, head-in-the-clouds, we're-better-than-they-are misandrony. Though not as good as her first novel [ Becoming Human, to which Testament is an unofficial ""sequel"" ], Freireich has a skill for plot that makes all of her stories a real joy to read."
5,an excellent textbook,"This is the only English language textbook of classical Japanese that is readily available, and it far surpasses earlier attempts to create such a textbook. It is well-organized, explanations of grammatical issues are lucid, examples are aptly chosen, and it is eminently suitable both for teaching and for self-study. Teachers and students of classical Japanese have waited years for a textbook of this caliber and may now celebrate its arrival. Contrary to one other reviewer's complaint, the textbook is indeed a ""package"" accompanied by a 50-page booklet providing answers to exercises and very convenient tables of basic grammatical forms."
2,get it from the library,"As a graduate student in the field of survey research, I am distressingly intimately familar with the books that are out there in this area. WHile this one has intersting articles, it is nothing mindblowing, nor does it present any new theories or ideas that you'll want to have on your shelf for reference. So if you've clicked on to this book out of an interest in the field, click over to your library's website & check it out there & take your [X] bank!"
2,A poor rendition of the tale.,This little pop-up book consists of three pop-ups on six pages. The story is so condensed that it is rendered to nonsense. This book can only be recommended for very young children who are more interested in pop-ups than a story.
4,"Symphony Nr. 4, "" sinfonia piccola"", andante","I haven't listened to anything comparingly beautiful for a long time. It is so simple, a folk melody, highly romantic chords and the result is such a fresh and melancholic piece, that is really worth listening. Kurt Atterberg, for me it is one of the really interesting new releases of hardly known or unknown composer from wherever. Don't miss it...!"
3,Snuff - Caught in Session,"Before you buy this, realize that it does NOT actually contain the song ""Caught in Session""! That was on a 7 inch a couple years back, and is my favorite Snuff song. You only get like a 30 second tidbit of that song with different words on this live CD. Still, its definitely good, with great sound quality and a good selection of what Snuff does best."
3,Not for someone who lives alone.,"While the concept is wonderful - who wouldn't love a no baste hand quilting frame - the reality is that this frame is extremely cumbersome. I spent days sanding and staining the pieces. But that was nothing compared to assembling it and moving it from the garage into the house by myself. It is stunningly time consuming to tighten the little screws and all the bolts and knobs, load the backing, batting and quilt top correctly and evenly and it takes up a solid one third of my living room. However, if you make it through all that, it's quite nice for the actual quilting. I'm not sure I'd recommend it to anyone - especially if you live alone and have to manhandle this by yourself ... and I'm not one to back down from a challenge."
3,It was an OK book,"I had to read the book in his class (the author) and wasn't a bit supprised by what the story would be like . I , myself didn't care for the book too much, I'm more for anything but Sci-Fi.But, I know other people that I know enjoyed it. I guess you have to expect it from him, I mean, I see him 5 days a week."
5,Adventures In Spacetime,"I think that the book of Adventures in Space Time is a very good book. When Gekko Troodahn helps neil up from the ledge thats the best part of the houl book. I think that derric neil is a good createrof all the people. In the book [Adventues in Space Time]gekko troodahn, mr.neil, lily,and so on. The way that neal makes all the people sound like ther rilly alive in this world and i thank that is incretible so that why i thank that this bookis the third bestalso i thinkthat is the most i ever read in a lifetime even when i do book reports."
1,Rubber!,"I missed the ""rubberized"" adjective in plastic ball. I was expecting a plastic ball not a rubber one."
4,Share point 2003 Interactive Training Course,"This DVD provides a great overview of all the important Share Point functionality with an easy to navigate menu allowing easy toggle between topics. As the IT Manager for a large construction firm, this DVD allows me to easily review only the topics I need to focus on. Continuous visual images of the narrator provide the feeling of being in a classroom environment although probably not critical to getting the message across. A great purchase for any company deploying sharepoint! Recommended."
2,Outdated reprint,"I was disappointed tofind that this is a reprint of a 1985 book. While some chapters have good content, they are in great need of updating. Healthcare and Chaplaincy have changed quite a bit since 1985! Don't spend your money on this when other works are available."
4,Work very well to balance flash color,"These will really improve your flash color balance in either tungsten or flurescent light. Be sure to set the camera white balance to match, Nikon has presets for this or use custom white balance or use RAW and adjust in post for real fine tuning.These fit my SB600s about as well as the SB800s a real plus. They lack the indents to click in to the flash the way the standard diffuser on the 800 works so they are a bit loose. I think I may add some velcro to hold mine on.This set seems to balance the light better than the similar Opteka vesion. I can't find a WB on the Opteka that works with the green."
2,Disapointing,"I love Debbie Bliss, normally. I got this book without browsing it first because I usually love Bliss' patterns. But on closer inspection, I should have gotten it from the library. The patterns are, well, dull. Spotted pillows, a tea cozy, a couple of sweaters that I don't like. I will make the spotted pillows, but Erika Knight makes far better home pattern books. Pass this one by."
2,Not as good as her other books,"I usually like Debbie Bliss books, but this one, even with its nice photography, falls a bit flat. The two sweater patterns are very nice, but the rest of the patterns are rather dull and of the ""why should I knit this by hand with expensive yarn when I can buy something already made up that looks close enough for much less money"" variety.Borrow from your library first, before buying."
1,We're Not Impressed,"One can only conclude after perusing this book that there really are not too many things to knit for home decor, or so it may seem. There's a very tiny handful of projects that maybe I would tackle or get inspired about, and a lot of other things that have absolutely nothing to do at all with home decoration.Hardly worth a bother."
2,It's a good thing that the price is low for this one,"Because I don't think it should cost more than 10$. Very few worthwile designs out of the 27. The two women's jackets are nice, maybe the cabled slippers, the seaside throw is nice but you don't really need a book for this one, you need a good dictionary of stitches and you can make your own throw. But I have too many knitting books; perhaps it would be good for a beginner."
1,Not for me,I have many of Debbie's books but this is my least favorite. There is nothing in it I care to make. I was very disappointed.
5,"New, fresh sound","The Big Wu just flat out jams. I've seen them live, and they can play. The album provides a great outline through the different styles that they can mold together into a style all their own. The song Red Sky provides killer lyrics along with one hell of a jam. I would encourage everyone, especially those of you who are into jam bands to check out The Big Wu."
5,"Big Wu, the review","I think I've played this album so much that my CD player melted through it. I can honestly say that it really is that good, and the odd thing is that the Big Wu have gotten even better since it was put out, considering that it hjas been a couple of years now. Definitley buy this one, and look for the new one, entitled ""Folktales for the Bloodshot"" coming out soon. I see it's on sale, don't pass it up when opportunity knocks. The sound is very ecclectic, mixing styles of rock, bluegrass, country, R+B,and anything else you can imagine with dueling guitar parts and sweet vocal harmonies. A real treat for any jam band fan, or rock and roll lover."
5,Why you should see the wu,"I have seen the wu somewhere up in the double figures, too many to count. And I am sure that there are others who have seen the wu many more times then me. Each show that I attend is something different, something that makes me want to come back for more to see what else they can do. I guess The big wu are like a drug to me, I need to see them more and more. Their cd is quite awesome, but to me you have to see them in concert to get the full effect of how truly talented this band is. I gain more respect each time I hear or see the big wu and as I can tell by the people on their mailing list, I think they would tell you the same thing. So if the WU is ever in your area, go check them out, you won't be disappointed. If there were such things as a good drug then I would recommend the Big WU."
5,The Big Wuuuuuuu,Album of the year? By a mile. And this comes from a band who excels live. I can go days without listening to anything but Wu. Buy this album or miss out on something absolutely beautiful. See them live when they hit your town or state. See ya at the show.
5,UPBEAT,I LOVE THIS SONG IT MAKES YOU A LIL HAPPY IN LIFE AND IS VERY CATCHY. I LEARNED THE SONF AFTER LISTENING TO IT 2 TIMES. IT MAKES WORK GOES SMOOTH AND WONDERFUL! THIS SONG IS GREAT I WANT YOU FAITH FANS AND NEWCOMERS TO JUST LISTEN AND ENJOY IT! ITS RARE THESE DAYS TO FIND A CATCHY SONG LIKE THIS ONE!
3,OK,"Actually, I give this cd 3.5 stars. ""The Way You Love Me"" is the pop version. The other song on it, ""Never Gonna Be Your Lady"" is an OK song. It is a mixture of gospel and blues. It's a really unique song. To be honest, if you don't buy this, you won't be missing much. This cd could have been better."
1,YUCK!!!!,"This song gets worse, more annoying and obnoxious sounding with every listen! If Faith Hill is trying to do pop it's not working! The lyrics to this song sound like something the Spice Girls may have done way back when. It sounds so goofy and immature. Very unbecoming of Mrs. Hill.Mrs. Hill needs to quit trying to cash in on the Pop phenomemon and stick to what she does best, COUNTRY!"
4,Wrong size,Just ordered the wrong size with the information that I had. It was too small and would not work. Returned product with no problem.
2,Pressure seal,"Even though this seal had the same product numbers as the one on my pressure cooker, the seal was too skinny and small to completely seal the cooker. We had to return the seal."
2,too small for larger jobs,I guess all my shredding needs were a little too much for this small shredder. The blade motor burned out quick and it takes less then 6 sheets to block it up. Only used it for a few weeks til it had to be trashed. Bought a heavy duty office shredder instead.
5,A Great Listen - Over and Over Again,"Distant Oaks' album of music adapted from Carmina Gadelica is a great work. It is both fascinating and entertaining. I bought it to hear smallpipes played well in a band - and it is that in spades. But I'm continually surprised and pleased at the diversity of instrumentation and the beauty of the vocals. In the few weeks that I've had it, I must have listened to it several dozen times so far, and still get excited when it comes up on my iPod.If you are a fan of celtic music artfully done and with craft and heritage, this is a must-listen-to. And if you're anything like me, you'll soon be wanting other Distant Oaks' albums - if even just to see if they're always as good as this one."
5,Excellent,I got the La legal Advisor as a gift. It is an awesome book. It covers alot and helps you to understand alot of legal issues.It covers so much and it is so easy to understand. I highly recommend this book. It is a must have.
5,Must own!,"I was entranced by the quality of her voice, the melodies and just the overall sheer sonic experience. I bought this CD and it lived up to every expectation. Even my musically less adventorous friends have commented on how good this album is. Highly recommended."
5,This made my trip to Africa complete,"I was in a cafe in Morocco when I first heard Oumou Sangare, it was Saa Magni, about her friend Amadou who she lost. There have been few other songs I have ever heard that have carried such a raw emotion, I dont know what the words say, but then I thought maybe its better I dont, the power of her voice conveys everything you need to know - she has such an amazing power in her voice, something that jumps out at you right away, and yet she sings about the most mundane of subjects for the most part.Even if you're not into african music, you will probably appreciate the quality of this singer, she's awesome."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I am a massive TFF fan and know how powerful their voices and performances are, and this was a bad night. Stiff, forced, and subpar. They should have taped another night and released it. Very disappointing. TFF on tranquilizers."
5,From The Inside Flap:,"The Mary Rose is Henry VIII's flagship. She sank off the Isle of Wright in 1545 and in 1982 she is to be raised, with the help of the most skilled underwater archaeology and sophisticated engineering, from the seabed where she has lain for 437 years. The book provides the fascinating background to one of the most important marine excavations of this century. It tells the story of the warship which was the pride of the Tudor navy but sank without firing a shot - and before the horrified eyes of the King himself - in an engagement against the French fleet."
1,Does not work under Linux,"I wish I could recommend this product, but it does not work for me under the Linux operating system. Intel normally has a good track record providing technical documentation so that open-source OSs such as Linux can have drivers for their products. However, in this case, no such support is available. This wireless card simply does not work under Linux because no driver is available. Rather, Orinoco cards are still the best way to go for Linux 802.11b capability. They are available under many names as Mini-PCI cards, such as the Dell Truemobile 1150.In addition, Windows support for the PRO/Wireless 2100 is also flaky. Specifically, when coupled with a Netgear wireless router, the card will often loose signal to the router, requiring either the router or the computer to be restarted."
4,Garmin Mount,"Bought this to replace original mount that broke. Good product, dash mount works particularly well. Windshield mount less effective, particularly in cold weather."
3,Be careful of Garmin Model,Not clear as to what models it fits vs won't fit but it did fit my NUVI 680
1,Item returned - No refund to date! Major mess on my credit card. Confirmed that return was received. Amazon - Are you there?,"It was never adequately explained that this item was already included in the purchase of the Garmin portable GPS. Within a couple days I returned it, unopened, with the mailing label provided by Amazon.com returns. I've yet to receive a credit.Additionally, the Garmin GPS was severely out of date. My husband used it the first time, (it was a birthday present for him) SURPRISE! He was out of town and couldn't find a restaurant that moved but had been in business for many years at the new location.It's been a credit card nightmare. I had to stop payment after spending 3 hours of my time trying to communicate online."
2,Just go to the RAWA website,"This book provides less insight than the RAWA website (...), and very little background information. Not only that, but the website features RAWA's activities since Sept 11th - barely mentioned here - including its continuing fight against oppression. Nope, it wasn't the Taliban who instituted ""gender apartheid"" (though they wholeheartedly embraced it), and things aren't all nice and rosy now they're ""gone"". Women are still being arrested for walking outside without a chaperone, and being forced to endure humiliating public gynecological exams to prove their chastity; and life goes on just as it did under the Taliban. Things were bad before, bad during, and now they're still bad. Go to the website and get a clear view of what's what in Afghanistan. Now. And see what could happen if you don't actively work to retain your rights."
2,Boring and dry.,I didn't care for this book at all. I've read a few other books about women in Afghanistan and they've been excellent but this one was dry. This book reminded me of a textbook because it was so dull. I would recommend going to RAWA's website if you want more information.
3,Roof Rails RAV 4 1998,I had a difficult time finding the original roof rails for a 1998 RAV 4 and did not want to spend the $400+ that body attaching model roof rack systems cost. By starting with the roof rails I found I can add cross bars for different uses later and still save money. The rails are good quality aluminum and came with good installation parts. I did hit them with a couple coats of gloss enamel since some of the powder coat had scratches in it from moving around in the box in shipping.
5,Absolutely brilliant Zemlinsky,"A well-kept secret gem! A shame that Supraphon has not re-issued this. Many other versions have come into the market since but this one is very special. Stars are baritone Ivan Kusnjer and Bohumil Gregor leading the incomparable Czech Phil - they might be a bit too silky smooth to some ears in contrast to the more forceful SWF Sym Orch under Micheal Gielen. I like Soile Isokoski for the soprano part (in John Conlon's budget recording) over Karen Armstrong, by a hair's breath. Only downside is that this CD contains just 49 mins of playing. The musical quality of Zemlinsky's work is self-recommending. And if you know Tagore's lyrics (pun not intended) from The Gardener, you might just weep at its loveliness."
3,Pretty Self-Explanatory,"It's a blank tarot deck with a few extra cards in case you get creative. Not much more to it than that. They're decent for drawing on, but a bit glossy still."
5,Most of them really work!,"This book really works! My dog enjoyed almost all of the things this book says makes dogs smile! Before reading this book I knew several of these ways, but found several others that I didn't know about and had a lot of fun trying them out with my dog! If you have a dog and are looking for new ways to make him/her smile this book is perfect! The book is also entertaining just to read"
5,97 Ways to make you dog smile,Both my dogs are smiling. Chloe loves to howl & Russell loves to be massaged.
3,No credit for pittie pg 3?,"It's really no surprise that the cutest dog is a pittie, yet they get no recognition in the ""models"" section in the back. And this has nothing to do with the content of the book, which I agree with! Love the book, just don't appreciate how they decided to leave out the cutest dog in the book!! :/"
3,"Pretty color, but chips.","I love this color, but it sure did not last very long. It chips way to easily. If you want it just for an occasion, it would be fine."
4,"I liked the book ""Changes For Molly.""","""Changes For Molly was especially good because Molly's dad gets to finally come home. He has been in the war helping wounded soldiers."
2,cheep watch,The Crystal on this thing scratched within a month. I would definitely recommend going for a different watch spend a little more money you'll get a lot more.
4,Real good movie based on reality,"This movie is very funny. It's hard to catch on TV, so I decided to buy it. The video to DVD transfer is very good in quality. Patrick Dempsey was very good for this type of movies when he was young (Can't Buy Me Love is another).In The Mood"
1,Used DVD of In The Mood,The DVD took a long time to arrive. I know I purchased a Used DVD but it will not work. I tried it in 3 different DVD players. I guess it is just a chance we take.
2,eh,"I LOVE PATRICK DEMPSEY TO DEATH! i would watch any movie with him in it... but i do have to say that i am sorry i watched this one! he is so.. HOT... however, this movie was sooo bad. it had some high points though. they should have shown him naked! then maybe i would have given in the mood 3 stars! the plot (what ever it was) was stupid. patrick dempsey is a good actor but sho... this movie.. eh..."
4,No More Haze or Fog,"My windshield 'n windows get a lot of fog from cold, wet weather. I bought this product at Ace Hardware 'n washed my car. Cleaned the interior windshield w/ a homemade mix (recipe Read online) of warm water, 1/4 diluted white vinegar, 1/4 windex in a spray bottle 'n wiped with a microfiber towel until dry. I used a sponge apppicator and added the anti-fog on my windshield. Success! The fog is gone 'n my windshields and windows are spotless. Be sure to clean the windows, apply a small amount of Rain X and dry everytime you clean."
1,"Low Quality, Not recommended","This product went on okay, at first, but when I went to go out later in the night I noticed that the light that came through the windshield was extremely hazed. Thinking I had overapplied it, I followed instructions to clean it up. This had no noticed effect. It took me 5 attempts to (mostly) get it removed. I would not recommend this product."
1,Useless,"I applied this product on half my car to do a test. I applied to half the half my windshield, 1 front window and 1 rear window.When I started the car in the morning, only the windows where I applied this product developed a light fog; my other windows were fine. Applying this product actually created fogging when it should not even happen!!!Buyer beware."
3,"extended battery good, replacement cover... NOT","What can I say? The battery works as expected, but the replacement cover is not the best. Very prone to cracking and damage. Difficult to keep closed."
4,This is what happened to punk,"You can hear the punky strutting tone of this disc from the first 15 seconds of the first song ""Seeing Things"" to the seductive cover of the Sex Pistols' ""Sub-Mission"". You can tell that this band is all about coloring outside the lines while helping you see everything in razor-blade guitar clarity. Hybrid industrial and punk with a spash of the dark that used to be gothic. A lovely little gem of an album."
2,Unbelievable how low some of you people's standards are,"This is junk. Sure, some of the rhythms are nice, but the vocalist is absolutely horrid. I can't believe the other members of the band put up with her. She's not only ruining this band, but also ruining the other guy's shot at success in the future.Nocturne played live at the Rave last night in Milwaukee. After the 2nd song, nearly everybody was booing loudly. It wasn't that the music was all bad. It was HER. She can't sing. Please avoid this. I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it's not fair to the other bandmembers who do seem to be trying. But they should kick her out and find a better singer."
4,What Ministry should have sounded like.,"I think that if you're a fan of older Ministry (pre Pslam 69 post Twitch) then this might interest you. If guitars and Industrial are to clash, this is how it should be done."
5,Nocturne is awesome!,"You should just try this CD out. Lacy(the leader) is very talented along with her other band members, Chris and Ivan. This band has alot of talent and I see a good future for them. Why not buy it or check it out to see for yourself!"
4,"Great CD, if you already like Nocturne","I love this album. Some of my fav. Nocturne songs are featured here, and the remake of sub-mission is particularly good--easily better than the original (even if it is unfair to compare them). That said, it's definitely their most ""out-there"" album, and I think that if this is your first Nocturne purchase, you might want to start with Paradise Wasted instead (don't get Welcome to Paradise b/c it's the exact same album as Paradise Wasted--except a couple songs short). Paradise Wasted is easily the band's masterpiece--being to Nocturne what the downward spiral is to NIN. If you really likeParadise Wasted, then check out this one or Guide to Extinction. Nothing by this band doesn't rock (please disregard the unhappy reviews trashing Nocturne--as the criteria behind those reviews has nothing to do with the quality of music on the CDs)."
1,Yuck,"I heard this was a goth/industrial type band, boy did I feel ripped off when I got my Nocturne CD's. I have never heard worse female signing in my life, if your a fan of goth/industrial related music save yourself the money, this is not for you."
1,Squeegee photo,"The picture of the hand held squeegee is deceiving. I received a metal-handled small-width squeegee. The rounded metal handle was designed to fit over an extension rod or something, so the handle was very uncomfortable when used by hand. The photo shows a smooth, plastic handle designed to be used by hand. I did not return it because it would cost too much for return shipping compared to cost of product."
2,Not the same quality as the single planes,"We bought a single Backyard Flyer plane locallyKid Galaxy ""Elite Fleet"" Backyard Flyer BiWing, then bought this 3-pack as a follow up because we were having so much fun with the first plane. Total disappointment! First, one of the three planes stuck to the plastic window of the packaging, losing paint. This plane is now off balance and does not fly right. Then, the launcher broke on the first use, one of the contacts fell off into the interior of the launcher, and it no longer works. Holding the launchers side-by-side, you can see the one that came with the 3-pack is not the same quality. We had put this away as a gift and so now are beyond the return period and stuck with only 2 useful planes out of the pack."
3,fun but breakable,My nephew loved playng with this toy but the foam planes are a little to easy to break. I wish there were a way to buy cheap replacement planes.
3,Shooting stick review,I havent used it yet. It seems ok. It doesnt adjust very high though so if you are short it seems ok
5,PERFECT For Beginners,"This is a very good yoga program to start off with if you have never tried yoga a day in your life. Its 30 minutes of calming and relaxing stretching. The instructor(Allie) is motivating and I like her style. I tried to do a different ""beginner yoga dvd"" and couldnt get pass the 1st move. This was easy to do and the included strap and brick help to take it to another level. Some say the mat is thin and cheap, but I have no problem with it, it is fine with me. This dvd offers really good stretches and helps me to relax and relieve stress after a long day or a really good workout. Intermediate and Advanced people should not buy this, it is too easy. Overall I liked it and use it weekly!"
5,Wonderful!,"Exactly what it says it is, for a beginner, and a kit. It's perfect for someone who is not enlightened/fancy/rich person who can afford Yoga classes/etc. The mat works, the DVD is ideal, and all around a great bang for you buck!"
4,Easy enough for beginners,"This is a useful product for entry-level yoga. I had never taken a yoga class before using this video, yet it was easy to follow and simple enough for me to perform all the movements while still being challenging. The instructor gives ways of making each move easier or more difficult, depending on your ability level, and explains the advantages and uses of each pose."
3,"An OK yoga mat, however...","it is not as thick & wide as I anticipated. I thought it'd be 1/4 inch thick & wider, but it is not. My husband needs a longer one since he is tall. Therefore, it works ok for him but it'd nice if it is as thick & wide as my own mat."
4,"Great dvd, great value","this dvd set comes with the mat, the brick and the strap, so considering what you would pay if you bought all that by itself, it's already a great deal in itself. The quality is very good and the yoga routine is great, too. I am a beginner, and I found it easy to follow, so if you are just starting to do yoga, buy this set instead of just a dvd, because you get all you need in one set for a very reasonable price."
4,This is great!!,"I'm so glad I ordered this. It comes with the DVD, the mat, the brick and bands to help you really stretch. I looked for a Yoga DVD at the store and it cost just as much as this but it didn't come with anything else like the mat. The video is great for a beginner. I picked up on the moves right away. It was very relaxing too. The only thing was I wish it was a bit longer than 30 minutes or at least had the option to do another work out. All in all I loved it though. I would recommend it for anyone trying to learn Yoga or just trying to relax after the work day."
4,A fine resource,"This book is a fine resource for looking up Lewis quotes or for thumbing through to read Lewis in a different light. The quotes are grouped alphabetically by topic (e.g. ""courage"", ""experience"", ""joy"", ""Macdonald"", or ""Middle Ages""), being culled from the academic and popular works alike. Lewis enthusiasts (or pastors or priests or rabbis looking for material for their sermons) would do well to invest a few dollars and purchase this book. It comes equipped with a preface & introduction, bibliography, a helpful index, and several pages of pictures."
4,Concern re Kindle edition,"Of the 20 reviews of this excellent compilation, 19 are of the hardcover edition. The one of the Kindle edition is also by an owner of the hardcover edition. I raise the issue that, without x-ray, the Kindle edition might prove frustrating to browse and search. I have only a borrowed hardcover, which I find delightful.Without some guidance, I must opt for the hardcover version.One mild criticism.....The authors/editors, like us all, have their own philosophy and point of view. This establishes a context for the totality of the selections which they have chosen to include. As with study of scripture, this produces an exegesis to which which Lewis might have been critical."
3,"Good, but long quotes","Very good structure, and easy to find quotes according to topic. BUT: Many quotes are way too long! And I also miss an index according to book (if you know that a sorn said something like ""lifting himself by the hair"", it would be easier to find by book than by topic).Still: I've already had use of it, and I'll probably use it quite frequently."
5,"Good, fast service","When I ordered this book from the supplier, I had no idea when it might arrive. It only took a couple of days!! So easy. I had read this novel before, but wanted to read it again for my book club. It's really an excellent biography!"
1,...,"This book was the unrealistic and boring pretentious adventures of a girl that I'd never want to meet in real life. The characters lacked depth and tried to make up for that with vagueness. This might be a decent book for anyone who doesn't realize that the ""perfect girls"" aren't really that in an incredibly guliable way, but for the rest of us with half a brain, stay away from this utter waste of time."
4,A good sad book,"Jill McCorkle is one of my favorite authors, and I loved this book, but it was definatly sad. It's the story of a young woman who finds herself falling in love with a man who ruins her life. A very real and touching story, it really makes you think."
3,"OOO, Ahhhh.... Eh....","a few new features now with ""HALF-LIFE 2"" Gravity Gun and a DB-Shotgun and not much more.Still it was ok, just not very doomly for me. and I'm a big fan od the Series, I still play doom 1 and 2 to this day."
3,Not As Fun As DOOM3,"This game was boring compared to the awesome DOOM3. One of the most frusrating aspects of the Expansion Pack is that the entire game is in almost total darkness. Halfway through the 2nd level I had a splitting headache. It's also very short with a rather abrupt, anti-climactic ending. The boss fights at the end of the levels are very challenging and next to impossible to complete. Fortunately, I know how to bring up the cheat consule and put myself in god mode to send the demons back where they belong. The console comes in handy for DOOM3 also. I love the DOOM games, but this version was a let down. Still, I'm glad I purchased it, and got a good price from an Amazon seller."
4,I Think You Will Enjoy This Game,"This game is realy great, but I find the gameplay kind of boring after a while. You see if you dont realy care that the gameplay is the same, then I think you should get this game.Heres my rating:Gameplay: 7/10 - I realy find it boring after a while because everything is just the same, darkness and enemyies.Graphics: 10/10 - Amazing graphics and might in fact be the best graphics ever on PC.Sound: 9/10 - I realy enjoyed the sound effects because they were realy clear.Value: 8/10 - I think the price is a little bit high for an expansion pack.Overall I think you will enjoy this game and you should get it.But know this, first of all you will need good system requirments if you dont want the game to lag.Secound of all dont expect much exitment when playing this game.Still I enjoyed playing this game, though I dont think I will enjoy playing it agin. So to get to my point, yes get this game if you liked other Doom games."
3,pc games,"Pretty good game. I could not finish the very last part without cheat sheet, even on very easy setting. Just got harder and harder throught the game."
4,Doom3: Ressurrection of Evil Expansion Pack,I still think Doom is the best game developed. Just wish they would go for aDoom 4.
4,Doom 3 continues,"This game was well worth the price. If you like Doom 3 and wanted more of the same, with a few new critters and a lot less email then by all means buy it."
2,A bit too much.,"I played all the orginal dooms and had lots of fun doing so. However, I find that with Doom 3 and the expansion pack I don't have fun playing it. The blood and violence is just to intense. Newer and better graphics didn't help this game at all. The graphics engine is awsome but needs some blood and gore settings.The orginal Dooms had secret areas, monsters didn't always jump out at you and more thought was placed into the level designes. Ammo also wasn't laying all over the place and forced one to some planning. Doom 3 just doesn't add up (reminds me of the newer Star Wars movies).In conclusion: For some people the fun factor will be greatly reduced due to the violence factor."
1,Not Worth $,If you are thinking of buying this game:1. Play Doom 3 again.0r2. Buy F.E.A.R.It is almost exactly the same as Doom 3.
4,still the champ of scary..,the expansion pack added a little scary to it.. I still cant play it when the music is up. I have to turn the sound down because it scares me.
3,difficult bosses,its ok but i think the game should be alot longer and have a better storyline...has excellent graphics and is stable...I can run it in windows 7 as long as you give it permissions and run as administrator and run in compatibility mode as windows xp sp2 it will run fine...Sometimes there are issues with video drivers but I solved them and so should you. Don't forget to remove all mods before installing or you can get nasty issues...you can put mods back after you finish the installation and make sure it runs ok.
2,Blow Back Problems,This Is a cool gun BUT...Has NO acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations.
1,Well...,well... the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good. i dry-shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas.i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some. its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games. 1.5 out of 5.
1,Look elsewhere.,"If you want a gun of this quality, go to Walmart. The gun breaks with very little abuse, which happens alot while playing Airsoft. Unless you are just starting out, I'd avoid this like the plague. Buy one that is made of metal at the very least.Pro - Cheap. Electric.Con - Cheap. Electric. Breaks without warning and no warranty. Flashlight is a joke. Goggles are junk. Blowback parts can cut you if you are not careful."

3,Could have been far more powerful than it is...,"The writer goes off on way too many tangents (as padding) that havenothing to do with the topic--and it will bug the hell out of you.However, having stated the above, when he sticks to the subject, and NeilSmithers, the main clean-up guy, the tale is absolutely riveting.Better have a strong stomach for certain descriptive passages."
5,Fine Collection,"This cd is a fine compilation of the Wolfe Tones work. The Wolfe Tones have been able to obtain international recognition for their work, yet they have still been able to maintain a body of work that demonstrates their love and desire for a free Ireland. This cd includes some wonderful songs, and these songs do a good job of encompassing the group's range. A fine cd for first and long time listeners alike."
3,not the best but you can't go wrong with any 7N,"The self titled album is definitely not the best of seven nations albums. I own every last one of them and the album i listen to the least is this one because it's not really a good representation of the band. It's somewhat contrived and it tries to be sort of a greatest hits for new listeners. my recommendation would be to purchase every other 7N album you can find and then make a judgement.The close mindedness of some people over the change in the band's sound is upsetting. While they are undoubtedly not as folky or traditional as they once were, their sound has matured and continues to become better and better. What should be focused on instead is the spirit and energy behind the band. Seven nations is a band that anyone who knows anything about celtic music should include in their library. you won't go wrong."
5,"Great ""Driving & Watching Crooks"" Music","I am a Private Investigator and my work takes me to little towns that are rarely on the map. I listen to this CD over and over when I am on the road and on surveillance when working. It's a smooth blend of lyrics & music. None of that ""pop rock commercial"" stuff! I love all the different musical instruments together-who would have thought of bagpipes with electric guitars? The instrumentals will bring a tear to an Irish eye (or anyone else who appreciates a moving melody). ""All You People"" has an excellent message-particularly during this time in history-I will hum it when listening to current events. This is a GREAT band!"
5,Seven Nations,Seven Nations is the best Cd I have ever heard.I have seen 2 of their concerts at the Glasgow Highland Games.They are better every year.They will eventually be on the charts.They have the best music I have ever heard.All of the songs sound great.They take rock music and celtic music and join them.There are the traditional celtic songs and ones they wrote.Soon everyone on Earth will have heard of them.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD OR ANYTHING AFTER BIG DOG!!!,"Having followed the band from their traditional days as Clan Na Gael, almost 10 years ago, I have watched this band sadly as they sell out and go mainstream. Their old albums, Rain and Thunder, Old Ground, and Big Dog, are such superior albums to the [junk] they spin out now. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with any of their new stuff unless they bring back Neil and Nick!"
2,A sadly lacking blend pop music with highland pipes,"Seven Nations is a mediocre blend of Dave Matthews-type pop music and traditional Scottish music...they do justice to neither genre. If you want pop, there are much better offerings; if you want pipes, get the Tannahill Weavers. Don't waste time with this blend that misses the distinct appeal of both genres.In the end, if you like the sound, go for it, buy the CD. But do NOT buy this looking for good highland piping or traditional scottish music. THIS IS POP MUSIC, the pipes are added to get attention, a gimick that seems to have worked. This music is severely lacking in the energy of traditional irish/scottish jigs and reels. You owe it to yourself to check out the Tannahill Weavers if you really want to hear good piping."
1,I pass,"""Corrs lite"". Inane lyrics, weak vocals and insipid rhythm. Occasional pleasant instrumentals, but on the whole, woeful."
5,If you can't catch 'em live...,"This CD will give you a hint of what the excitement is all about. These five young men, three from the US and two from Canada, produce a sound that is unique. Think rock, think Celtic, think original, and you begin to get a feeling for the sound. Kirk McLeod's song-writing talent, his voice, and guitar mesh seamlessly with the fiddle of Dan Stacey, Struby's bass, Ashton Geoghagan's drums, and Scott Long's bagpipes to give you a sound you won't soon forget. ()"
5,A great introduction to bagpipes and electric guitars!,"Seven Nations is the most popular celtic-rock band in America today. They earned this status thanks to a fierce touring schedule that made them huge draws at Scottish Highland Games and rock clubs across the country, and seven well-crafted independent releases. This is Seven Nations' first major label release, and carries a number of songs already available on earlier CDs, particularly recently-released The Pictou Sessions. A driving new arrangement of ""Big Dog"" opens the CD, and the breadth of musical styles means there's something to please everyone. One of the best celtic-rock fusion albums ever released, though older fans who already own The Pictou Sessions will likely wish there were more original material."
4,Copper works !,"Robin had already announced this brass project, and I must admit that I was a bit wary. Well, I shouldn't have been. The combination of the man himself with the usual guitar & harp and the brass band works wonderfully well ! There's no material of Robin himself, but there are some gems that I didn't know of - and that's almost as good as a new Williamson tune.There's the familiar ""Black is the colour"" of course, which he dedicates to his wife Bina, and the grim & beautiful ""South Coast"". The less emotional and ""funnier"" American tunes in this collection seem to be the least interesting - the emotional tunes are rendered more powerfully, I think.This live album will be of interest to those who like his explorations into the ""trad"" world, and I'm sure they'll be pleasantly surprised by the unusual accompaniment.Hans Wigman"
5,"Exactamente como describi√≥, exactly as described",No me quejo. Lleg√≥ rapidamente cubierto en pl√°stico.No complaints at all. The book came quickly and covered in plastic.
4,Well made,This product was loved by the person that received it on Christmas morning. It's well made and would dress up any domer's room.
3,three and a half,"three and a half stars for the original songs on this EP. the acoustic cover songs are not very good.i really like the two original songs though. they are excellent pop rock songs. just genuinely good song writing there. the album descxription is tripping balls though, this has nothing to do with punk hardcore or metal.the covers are not very good, though, there is no reason why you should listen to the covers, rather than the original versions.i think the two new songs are worth getting though, probably cheaper through the bands website, the full length should be good"
3,Very Good Information,"I have not read through the whole book yet but so far it is very insightful and holds a great deal of useful information. I recommend this book to anyone interested in this field, it benefits college level to change-in-careers levels. It really covers a wide net."
4,Friendly Little Eaglefinger,"This is a great stocking stuffer toy. It's beautifully made, and is as appropriate for puppet play with a toddler as it is to amuse the adult collector of things eagle. And of course it works for the child who likes little stuffed animals. It need not be a puppet. It can just be a cuddle."
2,Overall disappointment,"The text was hard to follow and was lacking in technical content.too much theory of society and cider .There were some recipes however. No photos, all B/W art , a few sketches....Save your money in my opinion.....Il sell you my book for 7.00"
