4,"Buy this product for the filtration system, nothing else","The AutoDry system is nothing new. I'm sure all you car enthusiasts already know that deionized water dries without spots. This system does what it advertises, but you're pretty much paying for the deionized filtration system in fancy packaging. And don't buy into the ""Mr Clean AutoDry only works if you use Mr Clean soap"" bs. I simply wash the car with Zaino, rinse with unfiltered water, and top it off with Mr Cleans filtration system. If you decide to get this, simply throw away the supplied soap, visit your nearest pepboys and pick up some quality carwash soap. Mr. Cleans' system is only useful for its deionized filtration system."
3,Seems to work but.....,I really wanted to like this product and I did at first. But I think its leaving sticky residue on my car. The nozzles or whatever they are called where the washer fluid comes out was clogged with sticky stuff.I was so happy when I first got this. Yeah it was heavy and awkward to use and theres the expense of the soap and filters and the fact that the soap wasn't really that good. I was so happy to finally have windows that were crystal clear. Clear only lasted a day before the spots really showed up.If I am wrong and this product is not to blame or I was misusing it then I will come back and give it 5 stars.
1,WHAT IS THIS SCUM!! AHHHHHH!!,"I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago. When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box. Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things. So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE! This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car. I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car. So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend. So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day. I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product. Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one."
2,Not worth it,I saw the ad on television and got pretty excited. That excitement turned to extreme disappointment when I first used this. It's more work to wash the car with it than without it. It's a complete waste of money. I had a few friends who warned me about it before I bought it and now I wish I had listened.
1,It doesn't work!,"Does this product sound to good to be true? That's because it is. A completely frustrating piece of !#$%*. I have tried the product several times and have changed the filter (more $!) and still find it leaves plenty of water on the surface with associated water marks. It also does not save any time as the dry process (which does not work) is as slow as conventional drying.Finally, why spend the extra pain and time of returning this? They want the reciept and the heavy thing costs money to ship. I just tossed mine in the trash and learned an expensive lesson."
1,Soap and Filters are Discontinued,The manufacturer (P&G) discontinued making the soap and filters for this product. It is now useless.
1,"Use This, Wash Twice...","This thing may not be the biggest piece of crap I've ever bought, but for the price it sure is. I bought one of these things a while back, used it IAW the instructions, and... Spots, streaks, smears... I had to wash the car again, the old fashioned way. I wound up giving this thing to Goodwill and actually felt guilty about it. My girlfriend gave me another the other day and it claimed to be improved, I figured what the heck and tried it again... Same results; washed the car a second time, the old fashioned way. For openers, the soap is too weak and they say you have to use their soap or it won't work; and the filter, well perhaps our Texas water is just too hard for that poor little thing. Listen, you want a spot free car? DON'T waste your money on this rip off; go buy a nice soft cotton towel, or better yet, a good chamois and do it the right way."
5,Try this on your home windows!!,I use this system on the outside of the windows of our home and love it. I picked up a long handled sheepskin window washing tool and love the whole system. Must do the windows when the sun is NOT on them. It has worked great now for two years. Inside of windows shine if you use a window cleaner and newspapers. I thought the newspapers would not absorb the cleaner--but they work great. Hope you find this as useful as I have. Bluekitty
3,Good as a Water Filter,"If you go to the car wash, then this would be a great alternative. However, I did not like the fact that after washing the car and drying it, the finish of the car was not smooth. The one good thing about this product is the water filter, which I will continue to use with my regular soap instead."
1,"Not for Use in Damp, Humid Climates!","I bought this product on a whim. I was looking for carwash detergent at Safeway, and the Mr. Clean AutoDry was on sale. Curious, I gave it a try.First of all, this unit wastes a LOT of water. After washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet. It feels like spray painting.Then you wait for the water to evaporate. Problem is, I live in San Franisco, CA -- nothing dries in this climate without help. If I hadn't hand dried my car, I'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.Another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the Mr. Clean soap and unit. It's as though it left a residue. I'm not sure what it is.But I'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way ..."
4,Very pleasantly surprised!,"I purchased this as a gift and liked it so much that I purchased another for myself. The diamonds sparkle very nicely and are nicely set, far better quality than I expected for the price. The chain is very delicate - so take care with it. The pendant is 13/16"" across and is about 1/8"" high/thick (nice filigree)."
3,"Contents fine, but book un-usable","The contents of the book are reasonable, but not great. All too often, there is a reliance on looking at supplied examples, rather than actually giving definitions and specifics. Both are necessary, so I found that having Ousterhouts definitive book beside this one to be useful. The two complement each other nicely.BUT... the book is basically un-usable because of the lousy binding! After only light use over a couple of weeks, the darn thing is falling apart! Pages are dropping out of it. I pride myself on taking good care of my books, especially ones that I plan on using for a long time. None the less, this one is fragile, preventing me from recommending it to anyone."
5,Computing Graduate,"This is one of my favourite computing books.After you've studied a couple 3GL system language's and played with Perl & scripting. Understand computing concepts, (Tcl probably isn't too good for random beginners or people who just don't like the paradigm). If you're into computing and want.., then go for this one.When you are the only person on campus doing-knowing any Tcl / Tk, you had better get the right book.I mailled Brent with a question and sure enough he got back to me. (try that with Lara Lemay).So for such a good book and service - 5 star award."
2,confusing,This book may be great as a reference book but falls far short of a book for initial learning of TCL/TK. I have programmed in C and have written UNIX shell scripts and still find the book very confusing.
3,"Old, still useful","It's a bit older than I wanted, but I knew that it was going to be since it's a pretty old subject. I was disappointed there was a floppy disk vice a CD. However, the floppy couldn't be read, so it was useless. It would have been nice not to have to type in the example programs. The book arrived in great shape and quickly."
3,"The book is average, at times needlessly confusing.","Mr. Welch's book is nice in the way the examples tie together from many different sections. However, I feel that he has too much time devoted to flashy tricks, immediately followed by stern ""don't do this"" warnings. While the examples are rich, they often are not explained thoroughly. I have found myself looking at ambiguous examples several times, which frustrated me. My suggestion is to include a brief question-and-answer section at the end of each chapter, especially in the intro. Between five and ten short questions would dramatically improve retention and also help solidify concepts."
2,The worst instructional book I've ever read!,"I agree with Chris Schock's review (above). Whenever Mr. Welch begins explaining a new command, instead of starting with simple, clear, to-the-point examples and building up to more complex ones, he foregoes simple examples entirely and dives right into complex, ""flashy tricks"" examples. For instance, on pg.75 he begins explaining how to create and use procedures in Tcl. Instead of starting with a straight-forward example, though, he begins with an example illustrating the use of default parameters in a proc declaration.Perhaps, if you are already familiar with the language, this book may serve as a decent reference to the more subtle aspects of Tcl/Tk. However, I really wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone..especially someone just beginning in the wonderful field of computer programming. You really do need experience with a more low-level language to understand Mr. Welch's style of explanations."
4,LTE,"Niebuhr's examination of ""The Responsible Self"" offers a new way to look at ethics. He does not propose that we ignore the historical ways of viewing ethics (ie. virtue) but he shows where they fail to explore all of the relationships involved. Niebuhr uses the term ""responsibility"" in a creative and inventive way. I wasn't convinced, but I was certainly challenged"
4,Robert James at his best,The Long Night of Winchell Dear is an emotional and romantic book in the true Robert James Waller fashion.The book holds a place of pride on my bookshelves along with all the others RJW has written!
3,Long time reader,I have read all of Mr. Waller's books and have enjoyed them a great deal. With this novel he seemed to be more in a hurry to tell the story. I always enjoyed his storytelling how hepainted a vived picture. This book he put everything together in the final pages of the book; disappointing quick ending.
3,The Long Night of Winchell Dear,"I've read several of Waller's books, beginning with Bridges several years ago. The Long Night of Winchell Dear was a good, fast-paced read - except when it got bogged down with too much detail & time spent about poker-playing strategy & techniques. I enjoyed Marty & the Driver characters - they reminded me somewhat of Steinbeck's George & Lenny. They provided suspense, tension and a touch of humor, and I enjoyed their dialogue."
1,The Long Night of Winchell Dear,Not anything like his other books. Boring and hard to follow. I can understand why I never had heard of it before.
4,product worth the price,I bought this item for my son for Christmas and I think that for the price it will be just what he wanted and will work well for him!
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I installed this drive and the machine recognized it OK. Unfortunately it will not read, write, or recognize any discs put into it. It also emits horrible whining noises.Customer service wasn't much help.Isn't there such a thing as inspecting products before they are packaged, anymore?"
3,Sony DRU820A,"OK Drive. Has problems burning DVD-R video disks. Though burning completes successfully, DVD-R disks (tried several different high quality brands)aren't read well by a temperamental DVD player. Same disks burn fine on other DVD burner."
1,"Poor quality, Difficult to use.","I bought this with the idea it would be great to have a Drop-In charger/sync stand for the Treo. I had a stand for my previous PDA(a Sony Clie) and loved it. However, this one I found does not work smoothly. You have to press down hard to make the contacts ""snap"" into the Treo, and then you have to wiggle it back and forth to get the contacts to line up to make the needed connection. Because it takes so much effort to get it to snap in/out of the unit, one of the plastic tabs located in the contacts row broke off and now the phone wont stay in place at all to make contact. It made the stand virtually useless. As I see it, they could have done much better in getting the mold to more closely match the Treo's shape. After it broke, I just gave up and have accepted to just use the origional, lay on the table, Palm sync/charge cable instead. I would pass on this one, it's junk."
3,cute book,"A little disappointed with this cookbook. Has history of the times in it, but probably not a lot that people would cook in todays times."
5,cookbook stand treasure,"Love the look of this book in my kitchen on a cookbook stand. It adds warmth, color and interest to an otherwise dull corner of the counter. I paired it with the scone book and I enjoy both"
2,Cued Language misinformation,"In an excerpt I read, ""Still to be determined is how reading skills of children using Cued Speech compare to children learning sign language or some hybrid, like Signed English""This book was published in 1998. They have plenty of research now--over forty years' worth, to show the efficacy of Cued Speech. I would have to wonder how much of the rest of the book is outdated as well."
1,"Shoud be titled ""Why you should use ASL for your child""","This book claims to be a resource on the choises for educating your deaf child. It is not. The entire book focuses on using ASL as the means of communicating with your child. That would not be bad- if it didn't present itself as an unbiased book. After it says that ASL should be used, it then makes you feel worse by saying that if you are a hearing parent with a deaf child, you probably won't become that fluent in it anyway. There aren't references either- so I am not sure where the author gets his information. It may be true, but there should footnotes on many of the claims. If you do choose to read this book, don't make it the first book you read after you find out your child is deaf. That is what I did and all it did was depress me. In truth, I haven't finished it and probably will leave it on the shelf to pick up after I finish a few others."
5,Best hand cleaner I've ever used!,"I've been using hand cleaners for over 35 years and this is the best, but make sure you get the one with pumice. Fast Orange also has a cleaner without pumice, but the pumice is much better!!"
4,Just as the old saying goes..,"That is..""a little dab will do ya"". This sure does the trick. And not at all hard on the hands as I expected a pumice product to be."
1,What junk,"I've tried this ""software"" on two computers and one crashes and the other the screen comes up blank. What a piece of junk. It should be recalled."
1,Expect problems with this program if you have DSL,"I purchased this program for my seventh grader with great expectations. I've always been very impressed with all The Learning Company's products. Unfortunately, this program wouldn't work on any of the four computers I tried to install it on. After going back and forth with The Learning Company's tech support people, for over a week, they finally told me that the problems I was having trying to get this program to run was a problem they'd seen many times with people who had DSL and there is no fix. Right now I'm in the process of trying to return this program."
2,Not impress with its presentation and graphic,I brought this software for my six-grader. I always like the learning company's product but this one does not impress me at all. The graphic is primitive and the presentation is boring. There is no extra practice or test you can do. My son ran through all the CD's but he really does not enjoy it. I just brought Math Advantage 2004. I have problem running the problem on a computer with 1GB of memory. But I install it on another machine and it works. I like the presentation much better and my son seems to like it too. It has an examination area where you can test your understanding and a game area to make it more fun.
2,Didn't work with my operating system,Ordered this as review software for middle school math students. Waste of my money as it doesn't work with OS after Win XP
4,Good novel.,"This is the first installment of the Matthew Lamb series. Lamb is fourth lieutenant on a British ship. This book has the usual fare--a cutting out expedition, a storm, and great battles. The book is compact and no episode is drawn out--as in Pope's Ramage books. It's an easy read; probably a good introduction to the genre. However, Lamb is no hero and his character really does not stand out in any way. The captain is actually the most interesting person in the book.A word of warning: the copy that I found had a rather juvenile-looking cover and gives the impression that it is for boys. In spite of the cover, you certainly would NOT want to give this book to your 12 year old grandson as a birthday present. The battles are very bloody, the language is, well, salty talk; and Lamb's 'entanglement' with a 'lady of the Scarlet Sisterhood' make this book inappropriate for the young."
4,Something Different Than The Marilyn Ross I've Read,"Phantom Manor is a thought-provoking, mind-boggling thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. When young Jan Davis inherits the imposing estate of Phantom Manor from her recently deceased grandfather, she fast learns that she has bitten off more than she can chew. A rumor of a curse lingers within the hollow halls of the great house, along with bitterness, hatred, and deceit. Jan must learn the secret of the house if she is to live to be the mistress of it! Is it truly the work of a ghost set on revenge....or is it a fellow human with a mind for murder?I was astonished by this book. I have read three other Marilyn Ross books and this was very different in many ways! A great work of literature, but needed a bit more to the plot!"
2,they screwed up.,"just like what the other review said.contrary to what the product picture shows, the female DVI end of it has the screws on the side of it that the male VGA end should have.and instead, the male VGA end has those nubs on the sides of it that the female DVI end should have had.there's no way you can get a male VGA with nubs on it, to connect to a female VGA with nubs on it too (and all female VGA's have nubs on it). The nubs hit each other when you try to put it in and stop you from connecting it."
1,Screw polarities are flipped,"The picture shown does not represent the actual part shipped !I will simply echo the other reviewer's comment that the polarity of the screws are flipped - there is no way to mate this part to a DVI monitor and VGA cable or vice-versa.I actually took the trouble to send it back to Amazon clarifying what was the issue supported by appropriate drawings - guess what, I was sent back another of the same part !!!I am resentful that despite my effort to notify Amazon about the discrepancy and other reviewers feedback, Amazon continues carry on the oversight ..."
2,Didn't work for me...,"Wanted to connect the DVI out from a video card to the VGA input of a monitor using a standard DVI cable, but this adapter did not work for that purpose. The plug configuration looked right- DVI female to VGA male- but the screws on both plugs are the opposite of what's expected/required. (The VGA plug won't sit in the socket because the screw sockets protrude.)"
3,Feedback,"Well laid out, easy to read. Because I am not a beginner in this area I found some of the text a little simplistic but I realise it would be of benefit to someone just beginning to write creative non fiction. I got most from the examples at the back of the book."
4,The Art of Creative NonFiction- 2 Thumps Up,"Lee Gutkind did justice to this book. Almost every advice you would need to help you write good essays, books articles,etc. My writing skills have tremendously improved after i read this book.The Art of Creative Nonfiction: Writing and Selling the Literature of Reality (Wiley Books for Writers Series)"
1,2 Defective Already,"I've now received 2/2 of these that were defective (make my Al powerbook crash, lots of errors in memtest). Going for a refund instead of a third.I should note that since then I've found out that my model of Al powerbook is special in that both Crucial and Ramjet offer a different ram module for it than for any other Al powerbook. I ordered from Crucial and their module works fine. So I'm not sure anymore whether the modules I received from Amazon were actually defective, or are just overly not specific enough in their compatibility list, as my powerbook certainly is a 1.25 GHz powerbook."
5,Best L.A.Guns hits collection,"Im a huge L.A.Guns fan and frankly im dissapointed with all of their recent ""Greatest Hits"" for 2 reasons.1.Their are TOO MANY OF THEM2.They're not original recordingsNow I understand that L.A.Guns were trying to ""up"" there original songs by re-recording them and I respect that, but they did it to many times, just look at how many they've came out with:Golden BulletsGreatest Hits & Black BeautiesThe Very Best of...Fully LoadedHollywood-a-go-goULTIMATE! L.A.Gunsand now this one...the thing that makes this best of better then the rest is this one is all original recordings, and im sorry but id rather hear some kick-ass original recordings then hear a band keep trying and trying to re-recording them and not do a very good job, this is the greatest hits you should get!"
5,Beautiful and Melodic,I purchased this wind chime as a gift and will be buying one for myself. It is beautiful and the sound is delightful. It has just the right amount of brass and baubles and highly recommend.
4,They give the nice ones a bad name,"This murder mystery was greeted with howls of outrage by the gay community when it first came out. But if one compares it to the real-life picture of the same milieu given by Trudee Able-Peterson in her book ""Children of the Evening' (1981), one is struck by the extraordinary similarity."
5,Awesome table!,"I love this furniture! It's sturdy, well made and easy to assemble. looks awesome! Came packaged extremely well! would buy from them again."
3,Also a cafe table,i use this as a cafe table with two ghost chairs and love it. Of course it isn't real wood and is so light it can tip over easy. But the look is right and I am careful to eat my breakfast on it.
4,What they said,"I gotta agree with all the praise heaped upon this cute little bus by the other reviewers here on Amazon. My little granddaughter also loves to be pushed around on hers, and it's made so that it can be used as a rider indoors without wrecking the walls and furniture. Sometimes she likes to sit on it backwards. And she uses the compartment to drop in and take out all sorts of things. Just plain fun and well worth the reasonable price."
3,Disappointed,"I was really excited about ordering this bus because I thought the lyrics of this item would have been ""The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round"", which is a favorite of toddlers. I expected this bus to be the one, so I was very disappointed!Jo Spiegel in Massachusetts"
5,Years of Use!,"We got this for my son's 1st birthday. Over a 1.5 years later, he still plays with it. It's not his favorite thing, but very few toys have kept his interest for so long. He rides it, put treasures inside and sings the songs. Totally worth it."
3,Bridget's Review,"My husband and I watched You Lucky Dog on DVD yesterday and it was a really cute movie. We're dog lovers and Lucky reminded us so much of Reese. This is a great feel-good, family movie to watch this holiday season. Animal lovers everywhere will appreciate this film."
5,Wholesome Family Movie,"If you like wholesome family movies with dogs you will like this movie. The dog, like all dogs, is very smart. The movie has an inspirational good ending."
1,The least useful book on Taiji Jian (sword),"Poor, small photos that show no detail; as another reviewer noted, ""its hard to tell which leg"" Olson is bending, I would say, Olson does not seem to be aware that his legs could bend; the worst section is that on the Basic Cuts, the photos from one to other hardly differ & lack clarity of application; the books only redeeming quality is the photo of old masters & these are not the best quality. Try either ""Chinese Swordsmanship, The Yang Family Taiji Jian Tradition"" if you practice the Yang Family's Taijiquan or ""The Art of Chinese Swordsmanship"" if you practice Wu Style Taijiquan. Or if you're really serious about swordsmanship, buy 'em both, skip Olson's..."
1,Poor,"I don't mean to sound mean, but I cannot imagine how anyone could give this book more than a 2 star rating. Its quite disappointing, especially coming from some one who studied with TT Liang. Olsen has to be history's least athletic ""swordman."" The only reason to buy this book I can see is the historical photos in the back, not for anything Olsen offers But some of these are repeats of Chen Weiming's Taiji Jian translated by B. Davis (buy that one instead)."
1,Don't waste your money.,This book was a big disappointment! The instructions were incomplete and difficult to follow. Many pages are wasted on old photographs of previous masters that are of poor quality. If you are looking for guidance this book is not the way to go!
4,Excellent Historical Photos,"For the accomplished practitioner of Taijiquan. The photos of the old masters doing the Yang style sword (jian) set are worth the price of the book. The masters are Chen Wei-ming, Hsiung Yang-ho, and Liang Tung-tsai.- Chip Ellis"
5,Amazing Holocaust story,This remarkable story of a young girl who survived the Holocaust can help young adults as well as mature readers better understand that horrific time in history - and what it takes to survive unbelievable travails.
5,Hardly believe this worked so well,"After letting my father fight with a clunky water softener that never worked right at the family lake cottage (rust on everything all the time) i installed this on a whim and the difference is amazing. We're replacing the filters monthly even though we're only there on weekends, but at $2 a pop, i can hardly complain!"
2,Made In China,"I buy many things of Chinese origin, but hopefully a filter product for my drinking water is not going to be one of them. Caveat Emptor. It's possible that most all of these cartridge filters are made outside of the USA. I'll be shopping locally for a replacement so that the country of origin is known beforehand."
5,Exactly the same as you'd get at your local hardware store,The cartridge fit our existing water filter canister and it works just like the ones I've purchased in the past from my local hardware store. The only difference is that they're much cheaper through Amazon -- especially if you order enough to get free shipping.
2,"A concern of ""made in China""","So far Culligan probably has the best rating among all. But it's made in China.I'm worried because I don't trust food/drink made from China. It's not NSF's approved listJust search for ""nsf seal water filter"" and look for Culligan.[...]Few concerns I have is we don't know what material is used to glue things together. Some places said it could beMelamine risin. I wish I didn't read or know and just simply use this product. I wish this is made USA."
3,Not as good as American Plumber,"When I removed it after a months service thin fibers of the cord could be easily pulled off the filter, they could get into the water supply."
4,Good,Made in China like everything else. Cheapest price I could find though. Just hope there is no hidden chemicals that I'll regret later.
1,worse movie ever!,watch out!!! this is like documentary movie.total waste of time & money vary baddddddddddddddddddddd
1,Check Your Facts,"When writing a term paper about the Jesuit missions to China under Matteo Ricci's leadership, I was pleased to find this book. Easy to read and well written, it seemed a real find. Unfortunately, at least in the chapter concerning these missions, I found several factual errors and misleading statements. Make sure you check your facts if using this book for research."
4,pleased,I was overall very pleased with the condition of the book and the quick arrival of the book in the post.
4,Really crazy--in a good way,"I don't think I can adequately describe Exile to the Stars in any meaningful way. The first quarter of the book is a wonderfully weird mix of settings that I very much liked. Things settle into normalcy after that, but the story is still great to read. Of course, the ending catches you just as you've stopped expecting the strange! I give ratings based on how much I enjoyed reading the product. The novel is well written and the setting is awesome, but I couldn't get wholly invested in the main character, Jeff. That isn't to say he is a bad character, there's just a disconnect between he and I. There are also an absolute slew of unanswered questions that I can't wait to be addressed in book 2.Read the sample and get hooked. :)"
2,"Good idea, poor execution on Fluke's part.","I like this unit in general, it's small and lightweight, and seems to do the job.However, the battery cap on the end is poorly designed, and pops off all the time, then after this happens repeatably, the clip on the side breaks off and then it wont' stay on at all. I expected better from Fluke.I have gone through 3 of these, but I won't be getting a fourth."
3,Great flashlight - poor voltage detector,"The flashlight is so good on this unit I almost gave it 4 stars. It is that good. However the voltage detection seems spotty. I think I will next get a voltage detector that has a probe type of an end on it so that I can be more ""directional"" when determining where the detector is detecting voltage from."
4,Excellent Little Detector,"I've never used any other voltage detectors, so have nothing to compare itto, but it does exactly what the description says, from a distance of several inchesaway from an electrical source (e.g. a few inches away from an outlet) it glows blue, and as you get very close it turns red, so it appears to be the best of both types (combining low and high sensitivity, though only for the voltage range specified of course), without requiring any adjustments.The only drawback is as several people have mentioned: the light is always on, which uses the battery up faster, but doesn't interfere at all with the voltage detection functionality (taking off one star only because of that).It may not have a self-test feature, and only has a visual indicator (no beeping), but I don't find any use for those in actual practice, you always need to check against a live source before using it on the source in question anyway."
1,Fluke LVD1 Volt light,"When I saw this item I thought it was going to be a handy little gadget.Well I was wrong!This is probably one of the dumbest things Fluke has come up with. I don't like the ideal of having to turn on the light before being able to test for voltage. Maybe if you could test for voltage without the light and have the option of turning on the little light when you need a little extra light, it would be worth it? Maybe? I threw mine in the trash."
3,son loves it,"My son got this car for his third birthday and loves it. He's crashed it into just about everything and it still looks new. The stickers come off pretty easily, but that's really not a big deal. I'm wondering why when we drive it it works great then all the sudden it quits working, then starts up again...not sure if anyone else has had this problem. This happens with old and brand new batteries. This is the only reason I gave it three stars instead of five..."
2,A Disappointment,"Took forever to install and ran relatively slowly. My machine is capable fo running much more grpahically impressive programs at a much smoother better quality, so I am left to conclude that the actual program is lacking in quality. The installation process was the longest and most difficult I have seen in 10 years. As a huge asteroids and space invaders fan, this was a big disappointment even at a bargain price."
2,prior review was harsh,"The problem with installation was a compatability issue. In the accessories on Windows XP they have a compatabilty wisard that got the program running. This progam may be just fine but it is for Windows 98 and older machines. This software was previously called ""The Princeton Review: Math Library"""
2,Confirming Faith: A Faith Development Program for High School Students Preparing to Celebrate the Sacrament of Confirmation With,I thought I was ordering Confirming Faith: A Faith Development Program for High School Students Preparing to Celebrate the Sacrament of Confirmation with the Support of the entire faith community. But what I recieved was a Mentor Handbook for the program. No where in the advertisement did it say Mentor Handbook. I have used Confirming Faith for many years. I lost my copy of the program and thought I was ordering a new copy. I emailed the bookseller when I did not receive what I wanted. I have not heard back from them.
3,"Good Starter, Lacks Sound and Construction Quality","This would be a great toy/instrument to practice basic piano fingerings on without the expense and size of a piano. Includes a ""Straw"" so that it can be played on the lap instead of in the hands. Case is very sturdy, some of the keys appear to jam easily though. (Note, when they keys jam I have had no problems unjamming them). Sound quality is basic and a little faint. A great way to do something new with music if you already play an instrument. New sounds, very fun, not studio quality, but definitely creative."
3,Best of the three,"In the third and final volume of the trilogy, Kaitlyn and Gabriel distinguish themselves as the spies who worked their way back into the Zetes Institute with the goal of bringing it down. The rest of the group is in the periphery for this one and that's fine, since too many characters can clutter up the place. Passion was by far the most exciting of the three. What's kept it from being a four-star is that it doesn't stand well enough on its own to be read by itself."
3,"nice watch,needed a new band to quickly.","the watch works fine, but the band had to be replaced becouse it got dirty ( it was cloth ). When I bought it as a gift I expected that the band should have been treated, it is a Burberry, and I expected better. Try buying a lite green band to repace it was in possible."
3,Aun no se pues no he recibido el producto,"Estoy esperando que me envien el IMac 5 desde USA, pero mi cunado lo tiene y el esta fascinado, muero por ponerle mismanos a esa Apple"
1,Buy something else,"Maybe as an indroduction this book and its advanced brother would be useful as a free website recsource. However, when you consider the price they are not to impressive.... keep your money for a referance book (with an index) such as ""Pro/Engineer Tips and Techniques"", ""Advanced Tips, Techniques and Work-arounds"" or probably any other title."
5,Health & Fitness after surgery,"I use this weight while working out with my Bosu Ball to help with balance and knee strenght training after a dbl total knee replacement surgery--- OUCH!! We have hardwood flooring and these soft weights do not damage our floors and other things, as would the harder weights would. Oh yes, when they bounce off my knees, when I goof up during training, the pain is not near as bad, a very good thing!!"
5,Wonderful,"To answer a previous question, the sound quality on these cd's is awesome. None of the scratchy analog to digital artifacts exist as they do in original releases. Also, contrary to a previous post, many of the songs are diffrent versions then those available on previous releases. A must for every Eagle's fan."
2,This is Unnecessary!,"The Great (although re-packaged!) music saves it from the dreaded one star.For Casual fans, the two Greatest Hits volumes are all you need, Die-Hards would already own this stuff, possibly a few times over considering the Vinyl/Cassette and 8 Track formats and re-purchasing on CD.Box Sets are supposed to contain the right mix of Rarities, Songs that appeared as B-Sides of singles (unreleased on album), and a few demos or alternate takes. Instead we get quite a few live tracks, good, but far from fresh, as it's just a rehashed concept from Hell Freezes over.Simply put, Selected Works just doesn't merit shelling out more bucks for familiar material, this is true with all Box Sets actually. I've made a conscious effort to avoid 'em. They REEK of Record Company greed, and shows a sign of laziness on the band's part."
2,Eagles take greed to the limit,"... Someone in the Eagles camp, or maybe their record label, or both, wants you to believe that your Eagles library isn't complete without a pricey box set, filled mostly with songs already released on numerous greatest hits packages already. Sure, there is a bonus live disc, but isn't that what the Eagles just did a couple of years ago -- an expensive-ticket tour with companion live CD ""Hell Freezes Over""? Sure, this time they toss in a couple of tunes from members' solo outings, but what motivates this release other than just another way for the label to cash in during the holiday buying season?Maybe this will sell well, but I bet it won't have legs. Wait a year or so and I bet you can buy this at a steep discount through a record club.After Henley's last solo disc ""Inside Job"", maybe they should have called this collection ""Snow Job"".Unless you are just a DIE HARD collector of all things Eagles, skip this one and stick with their earlier Greatest Hits collections."
5,amazing buy,This was shipped really quick and it was just great working with you on this sale. thanks
3,What this is overview is not saying about disk #4 is,"it is taken from the Eagle's live Millennium concert. The music is sorely lacking in my opinion, and had I known it was not a studio recording of some of the Eagle's best stuff would have left this boxed set on the shelf. The first three disks are great but the fourth is a DUD! If you like live music buy this set; if not, buy the singles of your favorites and leave this product alone."
3,"not a review, just a request","We've all heard this music before, but what I really want to know is: what does it sound like? Is there an appreciable upgrade in sound quality from the individual cd's- enough to justify the purchase? Thanks."
2,Form Over Substance,"This boxed set is a monument to greed. The Eagles WERE a class act, until this travesty. The ""selected"" music, 53 tracks, is spread over 4 CDs, with many notable omissions. This would have very easily made an excellent 2 CD set. Apparently the Holiday ""fast buck"" mentality prevailed. The remastering is fine, but what you are really paying for is a fancy cardboard box. The CDs themselves aren't even in regular jewel boxes, but open cardboard sleeves that insure maximum exposure to dust. The enclosed booklet is dominated by pictures, with little meaningful information or insight. If you are looking at boxed sets for gifts, there are many others far more worthy of your consideration. If you need prime Eagles, wait for their remastered individual albums. All of them won't cost much more than this turkey. ""Selected Works"" is only for those with a lot more money than sense."
3,This box set doesn't take it to the limit for Eagles fans,"There are a lot of great songs on this box set, I'll grant you that. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a sloppy and incomplete summation of the Eagles body of work. This box set has little to offer not already availible (and for less $$$) on the two single disc volumes of Eagles Greatest Hits (the band's two eras being divided by the arrival of Joe Walsh), adding only a hodge podge of mediocre live tracks, many of which, instead of drawing on the last two (fairly solid) Eagles live albums (""Eagles Live"" and ""Hell Freezes Over"") are culled from snippets of tape from recent tours, and consist mostly of songs that actually originally appear on Don Henley solo albums. All and all, it's like being served leftover meatloaf for Thanksgiving dinner."
5,Nothing but class..ic,"""Broke up,got back together,broke up,got back together.."" and so Henley joked on ""Funcky New Year"" from the Millenium Concert..Well,we are thrilled that they got back together and Hell Froze over yet again and again..The Live cd alone is worth the price. ""Please come home"" still the best christmas ""Sad"" song ever recorded with that haunting Henley's voice and Felder's guitar works doing the trick..""Victim of Love"" is reinvented as well as ""Best of my love"" both done beautifully..This band can rock.This is a must have for the ages."
3,Go to go!,"Oh come on Ive seen reviews praddle on but geez! lets sum it up..a) you like the Eaglesb) you dont own any Eaglesc) you own the original release cds which sound like like a pair of 70s realistic speakers are playin' em with a sweatshirt drapped over the top of em.d) you have 30-35 bucks you just dont know what to spend it on.If you fall into any of these catagories hey WTF, buy this set, It sounds really nice ( and I have a really nice sound system ) it has all the Big Hits, It has a Live disc to round it off, It has a good book, and really who cares about the digipak cases, if you are into the Eagles your old enough to take care of your stuff:)"
5,Alternate versions are overrated,"Some of the early reviews for this boxed set complained about the fact that there was not enough alternate versions of songs. Frankly, I think alternate versions are overrated -- there is a reason, after all,why they didn't make the original albums. I found this to be a very well-rounded collection of one of the most important bands from the 1970's. There are enough outtakes to please long time Eagle's fans -- check out the hilarious ""One of These Nights Intro"". And the inclusion of the Millennium Concert is great."
1,What a load of crap!,"This box set pretty much puts the cap on the career of the Eagles, one of the money grabbingest bands ever to come out of the MEMEMEME 70's. Not one of these discs is filled close to capacity. Nothing like a final rip off. When might I buy somethig else by the Eagles? WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER!!!"
3,Old Pete,"Old PeteSanitized, soapy, sweet. ""The Winning Team"" is saved from being awful by the immense likeability of its stars and its fascinating subject, but it could have been a lot better. It completely ignores some of Alexander's significant struggles, like epilepsy, while indulging in overwrought melodrama. Nevertheless, it can serve as an introduction to Grover Cleveland Alexander's (Old Pete) life and that life is full of human interest. Also, it seems impossible to not enjoy the company of Doris Day and Ronald Reagan. My favorite scenes are ""The chicken got tired of waiting...""; ""Show me a curve""; and when we hear Doris Day sing."
1,Winning Team,"I have never received this product. It was supposedly shipped on Feb. 4th, but I have never gotten it."
3,"Sugar and Spice, Everything Nice","The Winning Team is a biography about pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander (Ronald Reagan), a baseball player afflicted by an early injury. He was considered to be one of the greatest pitchers of all time, but a long absence from the sport was blamed on his addiction to drink, when really he had fainting spells and double vision. His triumphant return won the Cardinals the World Series during the Depression.The happy ending is not entirely factual, but in the 50s, audiences wanted sugar-coated movies. And that is what they got. The formula causes The Winning Team to be a bit predictable, but enjoyable. This is one of Doris Day's early films, but it is really Reagan's film. He plays the part with realism, toggling between the exuberance of winning and the depths of alcoholism."
4,Nostalgia and baseball..good mix,"I'd seen this pic several times over the years, prior to getting this CD. I've always enjoyed baseball bios, even though we know all of them have been embellished. And, being a Reagan fan from way back (especially in 'Kings Row') I had to get this one. Sure, the acting is standard fare but..well..it's baseball! Seeing William Bendix, Gary Cooper, Jimmy Stewart, etc. play all the old ballplayers from before my time gave me a sense of the timelessness of baseball. I think Ronnie did a good job, he sold me on wanting to know more about Grover Alexander and, hundreds of other players as well. We need more bios, all sports!"
5,Amazing Great,"A great book. I bout it cause yogi rules. Now so does the colorado river. It is great. I loves it. It is so very interesting. Buy it. Great book, about the colorado river. Peace out, Yogi rules all bears. Picinic basket."
1,Chael Sonnen,The same Chael Sonnen who everyone seemed to praise for his performance here was popped for performance enhancing drugs after the results of his pre fight drug test for this event came back.He also plead guilty to federal money laundering charges earlier this year by the Government after a dirty real estate deal from 2006 was investigated.Bottom line he's a cheat and a criminal. His performance here should be neither applauded or commended. He's a disgrace.
3,Cute if they would last,"Love the patriotic statement, and use them for holiday pizzazz....only problem, one set stopped working exactly 2 days after being plugged in. Did return and had no problems with that end of it, but it was just an Inconvenience that was not welcome during the holidays. Perhaps better QC is in order from the company who manufactures them."
4,Best little cheat book....,"This is a great little ""cheat"" book. It helps the young artist see a bit easier. It helps you notice things when painting that you might not otherwise see at first. It is kinda old, but somethings never go out of style. I hope you enjoy this little artist help book."
1,This is No Protein Powder,"This is no protein powder. Don't let the cartoon of a muscle-bound smoothie maker fool you. Even though the product description showed no nutrition facts, I took a chance and ordered this thinking it would have a decent amount of protein. Rather, this is what I got:Serving size: 29gServings per container: 313PROTEIN: 2g---Yes. 2 measly grams!Calories: 128Fat: 4gCarbs: 22gEven cheap ""Weight Gainers"" have more protein than this 20 lb pound box of sugar and creamer. Save your money and buy something else.No stars, but one star given because it's the least I can give this product."
3,Relative Information but not up to date,"The A+ Certification & PC Repair Handbook (Networking Series)As a former electronic tech and PC repair tech, I had been retired for about seven years and needed to update my information in order to get A+ Certified.This book was very accurate and informative with much in depth and realtive information critical to obtaining the A+ Cert.However it does not cover the most recent operating systems ie VISTA."
3,Ankle brace,"Received item quickly. It is actually a little tight for my husband's ankle. The one he was replacing was not all elastic, so was more adjustable."
5,my ankle will live more,"This product is perfect for people wich have wounded ankle, I use it for BMX and it's really comfortable and safe !not written on the description, this is sell buy 2 (not like 661)"
1,One person's tour of Indian mythology,"Calasso has written an interesting tour of Indian mythology; for this he deserves praise. But he lacks the grammar behind the myths; so he has depended on the 19th century indologists to guide him. The trouble is that they lacked this grammar too, and so the stories are not effectively joined together. The book also repeats a lot of 19th century views about early India, views that have been disproven by archaeologists and historians of science. Indian mythology is ultimately an expounding of ``trayi vidya''; Calasso would have benefited by consulting Aurobindo or one of the present, living masters of the Vedas."
1,"Collection of confused, jumbled tales","It is a book by an amateur who has applied the thread of Ka, ``who'', to bring together tales that belong to different contexts. Overall, a complete failure. Calasso forgets that myths need to be contextualized for them to have any meaning."
4,A good choice,"Looking for a compact but fairly comprehensive dictionary as an aid in translation, I chose this one mainly on the basis of reviews, as well as a process of elimination of those I knew to be inadequate. It is up-to-date and generally the words we look for are included. I still prefer a comprehensive dictionary on my desk, but this is definitely a good solution when traveling or on a low budget."
2,English<-->Hebrew Dictionary,"I returned this dictionary because it did not provide the gender of nouns, nor how to pluralize exceptional nouns such as the Hebrew word for chair, ""kise"". For verbs it lists the past tense, third person, masculine, rather than the infinitive. In summary it was not as good as my Lingvosoft dictionary for my Palm PDA which takes up much lase space. My Prolog hard-cover dictionary is much better though a little physically bigger."
5,Spice Girls FOREVER? You bet!,"Ignore what those mean, lowzy critics say..this new album by the girls is amazing! It's so much different from what they've done before as in the sense that this shows they can sing! I think the attitude is still there but with a modern sound. I don't care what anyone says but the girls are back and I'm sure they'll be here for a pretty long time."
3,Spice Girls Return -- definitely improved.,"First off, this is my daughter's CD, but I've listened to it at least 5 times and strongly believe it is the Spice Girls best effort. Their other music was too pop for me. I like more of an R&B edge to the music. I believe there are two problems going on with the girl singers/girl groups today. TO ME, they are all starting to sound the same. Is it because I'm older? I don't think so. Several of my daughter's friends (13-16) say the same thing! What happened to COMPLETE originality? Do these groups only use 3 or 4 popular producers and writers today so they have THAT SOUND? Another thing. Did the Spice Girls wait too long for a followup? Hasn't it been about three years since their last studio CD? I'm not too sure, but I'd venture to guess that the train has left the station. Otherwise, if you're NOT into WHO'S HOT and WHO'S NOT and you want a GOOD, SOLID R&B/POP CD, then purchase this one."
5,"SPICE GIRLS ARE ""FOREVER""","I got the album on november 7th and once I put it in my cd player I instantly felt the beats and grooves the spice girls had to offer. They have certainly done a great job on their third effort and first without geri halliwell{ginger). This album is packed with great songs like of course ""Holler"", also one of my favorites like track 9 ""If You Wanna Have Some Fun"" and others like ""Right Back At Ya"" & another favorite ""Time Goes By"". Overall the Spice Girls have proven people wrong. They can survive without geri and in a way sound better. This is a must have for spice fans and for those who are curious to know how their style has changed and how mature they are now. They will certainly last for many years to come. Because they are ""Forever"""
2,Don't Bother With This One,"I was the biggest Spice Girls fan until this came out. I don't know if it was because I grew out of the whole ""Girl Power"" fiasco or because this is just one disappointing album. Or maybe the magic was just lost without Geri. Whatever it was, this album is a disappointment compared to the girls' first two albums - all the songs sound the same (almost all of them having been produced by Dark Child) and it just gets boring after the third track when the album just gets nowhere. You will be more entertained watching the grass grow instead. Yawn."
5,Beautiful,"The Spice Girls are still amazing. You can tell there's that one missing ingredient, but The Spice Girls aren't over yet. Holler and Oxygen are to die for."
3,Used to be Unique,"Too bad. I was terribly looking forward to this offering, but alas.... Many of the songs are identical and/or derivative. In their heyday not too long ago, the Spice Girls really hit ""white girl hip-hop (no offense to Mel B/G)"" in both their dance hits and their ballads. Mel Chisholm has a voice that cuts to my soul, and it amazes me that she can't find a vehicle for it that would really showcase it, but that's a different review. Die-hard Spice Girls fans will just enjoy hearing the voices again, but if you are just trying them out, don't. You'll wonder what the big deal was about."
3,Obsession,"I am one of the million people who were obsessed with the SPICE GIRLS. Trust me, I was majorly bummed when I heard Geri left, motly because I heard the whole group broke up. Then I heard this come out, and I was dissapointed whn it was r%b/soul. Pop is thier gig. Some of these songs are cool, but it really isn't the same without Geri. Good Luck to them."
3,"It's alright, but a definite departure from their first two albums","This cd does contain a handful of great tracks. And none of these songs are altogether terrible. But it certainly lacks the spunk and excitement which made their earlier albums pop gems. This one, sadly, sounds for the most part like a very American produced pop album. It isn't a bad album. Just don't expect to have your world rocked. Most of this release feels rather like bland club music. ""Goodbye"" really is the standout track. But most fans will find reason to listen to the majority of these tracks, even if they aren't at the same level as the ones found on the albums which came before this one."
4,Quality Music,"'Forever' is a really good cd. Almost every song is great. The only songs I don't care for are Get Down With Me and Wasting My Time as they sound exactly alike, to me anyway. The lyrics are all deep and touch a place deep inside that so many other acts try to copy but just can't. It is sad that Geri isn't on this album as she really added something magical to the group. But with or without Geri this is a great album that any pop fan should have. P.S. Oxygen is my personal fave, followed closely by Right Back At Ya, which is like their version of 'Survivor'."
4,got it together for 2000,"Ok. It's a departure from the Spice Girls sound of the past but now it's up to date and has a funkier, pop sound thanks to their new producers. It still has that Spice Girl ""girl power"" attitude but is backed up with stronger beats and rhythmns. Much less bubble gum than their previous records, Forever puts the Spice Girls in the current mix of what popular dance fans want to hear. The fast songs like ""Holler"" and ""If You Want to Have Some Fun"" make you want to dance and the slow ones like ""Oxygen"" and ""Tell Me Why"" make you want to sing along and reflect on the words. If the Spice Girls continue along this path, they should only get better."
4,Forever- Spice Fan Review,"This is not your typical Spice Girl CD. It isn't as poppy and upbeat as Spice and Spiceworld. It is mature, deep and heart felt (just listen to ""Let Love Lead The Way""). I like their new sound, new group and new style. They tackle more grown up issues and show you that they aren't just British bimbos that have nothing to say. I think the real fans will follow in their new direction. I sure am."
5,Spice girls really add a lot spice to your life!!!,"HI: The spice girls came out ten years ago as the pop sensation of the 90's. They are a talented bunch of musicians and singers!!!Songs are catchy and easy to sing along to. I really like them. It's not too rockish, and not something you'd fall asleep to. Forever has a great deal of nice songs. I especially like : Let love lead the way, and Time goes By.> Great job by the Spice Girls!!"
1,"It's the spice girls, go figure.","This is terrible! I heard some of this album against my wishes and I think it killed some braincells. Speaking of braincells, if George W Bush does get in, the spice girls will be the only people who aren't smarter than the president."
3,"Bye, Bye!","Geri left Spice Girls after making two successful albums with Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Mel C, and Mel B. They were the girl power group that made pop music shine again. This album is much more peaceful one than the other two ones...there's only four songs that could have been included in other two albums...""Holler"", ""Goodbye"", ""Let Love Lead the Way"", and ""If You Wanna Have Some Fun""...and mostly they are ballads...although there were five ballads in the first two studio albums...The other songs are quite peaceful although there's taste that they have tried the same ""Right Back at Ya"" for example...but this fails.Stars: Goodbye, Let Love Lead the Way, Holler"
3,Is it Forever?,"Since ""Spiceworld"", spice girl's career has changed a lot. All the girls developed their own successful solo albums, especially Mel C, who has done a great job during the group vacation. Anyway, I have the feeling spice girls will not last forever. This album is different from everything they did. It's pop music again, but with R&B beat in almost all the tracks. ""Holler"" is fine, and the video has improved the song! ""Let love lead the way"" will surely become an instant hit, as soon as it starts playing on the radios around the world. I also love ""Goodbye"", in spite of the fact that this track was released as a single long before this album came out. ""Oxygen"" and ""right back to ya"" are good tracks as well. Is it true that frindship never ends? Let's see..."
5,Good to see them back,"I'm not sure why [others have] gave them such a bad rating on the album. I find the album very refreshing and enjoyable. Its good to hear more from Victoria (since in the last two album, she does majority of the backups)- Holler is a great song, got a great beat and an awesome video. Let love lead the way is a wonderful ballad- very catchy and gentle. Other tracks are also equally as great. Time goes By, Oxygen are really nice- showcases the improvement in the girls' voice. The chords are really good- Tell Me Why, Right back at Ya are two great dance beat songs that I enjoy listening to. This album deserves a 5 in my book. It may not be the pop-songs that some might expect from them, but change is good, and this time, the change is totally rocking my world."
3,"Not sparkly, just different","I bought the US version of this album and listened to it once and got the opinion that all the songs sounded more or less the same and drifted into each other. Sometimes I couldn't tell if it was still the same song or not. The sparkle has gone out of their songs and instead of remaining unique and original, they are starting to sound like All Saints and other bands around. This will not appeal to their younger fans at all. However, this CD was enhanced with two videos from the album and the videos were quite good. Their experiment with a different sound was brave, but ""come back the old spice girls, we miss you""!"
5,This album is off da HOOK!,"To be honest at 1st listen I did not like the album, but then I gave it another listen and now I can't keep it out of my player! Gone are the days of the bubblegum platform wearing girlpower group. Now is a new mature sound (r&bish type pop) & image of mature WOMEN. Yes I do miss the 'girlpower' days, but with this new fun album I don't have nothing to complain about. The only songs I don't like are like about one now that I think about it lol! Give this album a chance, it won't hurt to get Spice fever!"
1,THIS DESERVES NO STARS!,"This is a tacky collection of tired, pathetic tunes. ""Holler"" sounds like the cliche cats screeching in an alley. There is not one single good thing on this atrocious mess. I hate the Spice Girls and feel they can't even sing in the rain, let alone in anyone's hearing range. They are really bad. Save your money and buy something good, like a Mariah Carey or a Jewel CD instead."
5,THE SPICE GIRLS REUNITE!!!,THE SPICE GIRLS ARE BACK TOGETHER EVERBODY!!!http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=5615
2,Disappointing...,"This Cd was very disappointing to buy. I thought that it was a waste of money because most of the songs have the packaged britney spears' feel. I was a huge Spice Girl fan, and I think that the group really needs that '5th voice' which was ginger spice, a.k.a. geri halliwell. I was disappointed because some of the songs were rather suggestive of sex, and I was embarrassed to play the songs in front of my parents. Good Cd's people aren't embarrased to play in front of their parents. IF you are looking for a major dissapointment to a somewhat dissappointment, don't buy this cd. Former Spice Girl fans: this is a 'no'."
4,This is Great!!!!!,"I bought this cd not too long ago and really enjoyed it! The Spice Girls have really changed their style over the past few years and it's deffinately for the better. Instead of the real pop sound,they now have converted to a more r and b type style. I liked the smooth vocals and the good beats. My favorite song would probably have to be ""Let Love Lead the Way"".I deffinately reccomend this cd for anyone even if you're not a Spice Girls fan."
4,Great Comeback!,"Well, this CD is definately different than their previous material. But, people change. And music certainly does. I think that the Spice Girls have had a MAJOR awakening since Geri left. I mean, you dont see other groups sticking together when one has departed, or when two members have children, and almost all of them have done some solo work. People change, and the Spice Girls have shown the other side of them. Instead of being ga-ga girls they went to mature women. I think this CD is great, but I am not an avid fan of many slow songs. It's worth the buy for the music and a collectors item. Hopefully, they will release a fourth album that will recap all their memories. I will definately miss them."
1,They Lost It Without Geri,"I used to be the biggest Spice Girls Fan ever. Then when Geri split the group i hardly listened to the songs w/o her (Goodbye, Christmas Wrapping, We are family) and Ginger was one of my least favorites but now that shes gone the CD stinks. They've grown up too much too fast. I now admire Geri because she dosent let anything get in her way, she still kept the Spice, Spunk, and Courage that she had since the Spice Girls started, the other girls (even Emma the youngest) have lost it. I dont want this to become as long as a book so im just gonna leave off in saying that if you want to buy this CD you can, but if u have a choice like Geri Halliwell's CD or this CD pick Geri's cuz it'll keep you feeling like your life is a big party. This CD will make you miss her."
3,Good CD but something's missing,"This CD is a pleasure to listen to. The outstanding tracks are ""Holler"", ""Let Love lead The Way"" (which is a lovely song), ""Tell Me Why"", ""Right Back At Ya"" and of course ""Goodbye"". But I can't help but think something's still missing - namely Geri. To me she was the ""spice"" and the ""heart"" and the ""soul"" of the group."
3,It's ok,"I myself am not a ""big"" spice girl fan. Some of there material is ok. The only songs of Forever that I do enjoy are Holler, Let Our Love Lead the Way, and Goodbye. Otherwise I think the album is *really bad*. They just don't have it all compleatly together like they used to. The vocals are terrible and barly fit with the beat of the song. I think Geri was smart to leave, and what she made was 5 times as good as Forever!"
5,Great Album by one of my fave bands!!,"this album i found today, i saw them on tv today, i just wish i had more stuff of them, cause there like my fave band ever (Besides The Veronicas) and i LOVE IT, Holler is one of the best songs ever!!Let Love Lead The Way is a beautiful ballad!!Love,Katy"
3,Farewell to SG!!!,I can't believe I used to like them!!!! But who didn't? They were the UK girl group that were everywhere!!! Including my wall and in my cd player!!! I may be from the US but these girls will probably forever be the best girl group in history whether they are so over or not. I'm just glad I did grow out of them though. They will be missed!!!!
2,not right!,the spicegiels were horrible. i didnt like it they didnt evensound as happy as usual. it might have sounded better if itwas with geri aka ginger spice!
4,good song,"I actually haven't heard the whole album yet, and I'm not a huge fan, but I have to admit I really like the first single ""Holler"". I find it catchy , slick, and kind of soothing in a way. Great beat too. I think its one of their best songs overall, so it's wierd to see all this bad press about how they are over and have lost their touch."
3,Spice Girls loose the &#65533;Ziga-zig-ah&#65533;?,"I was so disappointed in their third album. It seemed like without Geri their zest was gone. ALL of the songs are more mellow, something unexpected from the Spice Girls. The songs were more R&B soul, or something on those lines. The lyrics are well written, but I wish that the girls wrote them. It gives them originality, and it also got them to #1. I've been told that they didn't write many of the songs on this album. I was a little happier to hear more of Victoria on this album, but the songs sounded... ""empty"" or ""weird"" without #5. If you're a Spice Girl Forever (excuse the pun) then this album is perfect for the collection. If you once were a Spice Girl, and didn't really shed tears when Ginge left, don't waist your hard earned cash."
2,Alienating,"No wonder Victoria said in a recent interview that it wouldn't matter if they didn't go to number 1 in the UK because Westlife release theirs on tha same day: becasue they aim at gaining even more success in the US, this album is totally R&B, and in my opinion this is a stab at the old fans. They totally abandoned the formula that got them this far. So what if they recorded the tracks all over the world? They all sound the same and for R&B tracks there's much better out there, even for a R&B hater like myself. Don't know how other fans will take this in Europe, I'm sure it will do good in the US, but I don't like it one bit. Goodbye is totally out of place (I like it)."
1,Possibly the worst album in the history of mankind......,"As Sporty spice says in ""Right Back at Ya,"" ""you thought we wouldn't make it this far...."" They didn't! This is one of the worst albums I've heard in a loooonnngggg while. I have both ""Spice Girls"" and ""Spice World,"" and both of them are a 100 times better than this lame attempt at music. Now that Geri's gone, they've changed from perky, Girl Power type girls to a failed try to be the girls equivilant of N*SYNC. My advice? Don't go anywhere near this CD if you don't have to."
1,Strike three!,"Can't the shi-e girls do anything right? Their first two albums were personifications of what is wrong with modern music. This travesty is a contender for worst album of the year!A lot of people (naive optimists?) thought that the girls had decided to leave us alone after ginger split. It's too bad they didn't: music is already suffering enough under the likes of limp bizkit, britney spears/christina aguilera, kid rock, blink-182, boy bands, girl groups, and so-on.To the girls: if you want to be taken seriously, you are going to have to do more than just dress differently. The fact is, your songwriting is awful and none of you can sing. To justify the new image you are trying to create, these two core problems must be resolved.Otherwise, I suggest you stay in the UK and leave the rest of us alone. Despite the image change you are still very annoying, and like I said earlier, we've got enough problems of our own."
2,Disastrous,"I was astonished to read the reviews of Forever when it was initially released, but having bought it and listened to it I can see they were wholly justified. When Geri Halliwell left, she took whatever personality, charm, fun and dare I say spice with her. There is no denying that these girls have talent, but it is pretty short in supply on this bland, generic wannabe album. The only decent tracks are Holler, Goodbye and Oxygen, the latter two the only ones that deserve to be called singles ! Come back Geri all is forgiven...."
1,Disappointment,"I have to admit to a guilty pleasure: I really like the Spice Girls -- or I used to, anyway. ""Wannabe"" was great fun and I regard ""Who Do You Think You Are"" as one of the best tunes ever for dancing Latin Hustle. They'd already lost some steam with the ""Spice World"" album, but it was still a pretty fair offering.Today I got ""Forever"" off the shelf, blew off the dust, and tried the ""enhanced CD"" stuff for the first time. Downloading the RealNetworks player for OS X was a real pain in the butt and I felt betrayed in having to surrender so much personal information and having to submit to many things in a ""terms of use"" agreement I found objectionable -- just to access data I had already paid for on this CD. With ""Forever"", Virgin has made the worst ECD I've bought."
4,Nice music,"The cassette has nice music, good harmony and a good beat. I bought this for my daughter as she is a Spice Girls fan. I've heard the cassette several times and have enjoyed listening to it myself. It's not something I would've bought for myself but it's still got good music."
4,Better Than You Think!!! Honest,"Okay 4 million sales is little by Spice Gurl standards, however this album yielded some of the Spicers' best work. Low interest owing to one single (Holler/Let Love Lead The Way), however there are some real cracking dance songs & trax which really display their talent. If You Wanna Have Some Fun is a total blast. There's also a few nice slowies, the best of which is the achingly gorgeous Goodbye. Their star may have waned & unfirtunately public interest slackened alongsaide, but one look at the producer credits alone indicate the talent on this cd. Go on, give it a chance, you may just eat your words. I'm still nibbling @ mine. An admirable addition to your cd collection should you like pop/dance/soul/r#n#b/ Just avoid the pictures Emma B looks like Pauline Fowler from EastEnders & Mel C had a fight with her hairdresser the morning of the shoot. Great songs tho!!"
4,Groovy,"I have all 3 Spice Girls CD's and enjoy listening to all 3. (...)This 3rd album, in my opinion, is still a pretty good Pop/R&B; album but with a more ""mature"" theme than their previous 2 CD'sWith songs like ""Weekend Love"" and ""Wasting My Time"", they've turned from ""Girls"" to ""Women who don't want to be scorned for having fun"". Yes, withough ""Ginger/Geri"" Spice, they're playfulness in their songs is lacking, yet it is stil the Spice Girls dance/pop/R&B; groove. It's still catchy melodies, and you can still sing along with their lyrics. I must disagree with the negative reviewers, I am not sorry I own this CD."
1,I USED to be a fan!,"I used to really like the Spice Girls, but I have not remained a faithful fan to them. For a while there it seemed like they were over and done with, then they finally came out with a new album, which took way too long for what it is. I listened to my friend's copy, and they've taken a turn for the worse. Without Ginger, they're no good anymore. When she left, they fell apart. And this is what you get when you try to keep it going after something like that happens. Not very good."
1,Poor Quality,"I was happy with these sheets when I first received them,that was until I washed them. Once they were washed the color bleaded and the sheets now look like they have large stains on them and they are now multi color instead of the mocha color they once were. They were also a bit rough for being 800 thread count,I expected much better quality then received,I would not reccommend and I would not purchase these sheets ever again."
3,Good deal on a cheap hole saw,"So it's a little limited.. what do you expect for the price? Locks well and is a little tough to get going the first time, but for an 'adjustable' hole saw, it works just fine, sawed some holes that I needed sawed and it'll find its way to my toolbox without being replaced. I did have a few issues with the threads on the locking nut binding up, but after a few tries it worked its way back to normal just fine. If you're not a hard-core hole saw user, this is certainly not a bad option."
3,Good for light duty limited use.,"I needed to drill a hole in a particle bord desktop. The desktop was about an inch thick. Half way through the bit was clogged and stopped cutting. After removing the bit and cleaning it out and going back in the hole a couple of times I was finally through. For the money I cant complain, lots of bang for the buck if you lively hood does not depend on sawing holes.Pros:Cheap, works, installs easilyCons:Cheap, might take a while to cut through hard woods."
4,For the price it is a good value,Cheap set but it does the job. I'm an occasional user so it is just what I was looking for.
3,You get what you pay for,"You looked for the cheapest hole saw kit. This is about what you're looking for. This is perfect for when you will probably only use it once, or maybe up to a dozen times for light duty drilling. It's just steel. Of course you won't get carbide tipped blades for this price. Buy this if you truly just need something in a pinch. It won't last long, but it's good for the price."
5,Road Ready!,"My son is an avid motorcycle rider- he rides tracks, trails, anywhere he can; but I have been unable to take him because I didn't want to pull a trailer. This carrier is the perfect solution on my Honda Pilot. He can load his bike, I can drive him anywhere, it's easy to unload- it came in the mail, was easy to assemble. It fits the back of my car and doesn't stick out anywhere- we can throw his gear bag on the back if needed with a gas container, as well. Price was fair- definitely better price than going to motorcycle shop that wanted over $200. Way cool!"
5,Awesom Bike Hauler,"I love this hitch hauler, and get a ton of compliments from other dirt bike owners. It's a lot easier than towing a trailer and compact. I can still go through a drive through when on long trips, no problem. The quality is great and it looks cool on the back of my Liberty Renegade. I would recommend this to anyone. Just be sure to get some really good tie downs and you are set."
4,Good product but one issue...,Item is easy to put together but the anti-sway brackets needed to be modified - bolt hole filled and re-drilled 1/2 off. Maybe this is an odd thing for my hitch or maybe it's not.
2,Light Ramp that works,"Well, I've had this ramp for about 7 months now and it broke. Hauled the dirt bike (270lbs full fuel) about 8 times and it has bent/twisted itself on the left side. Haven't contacted the manufacturer yet to see if they will warranty it, but its useless now. I was driving down a dirt rode and it twisted forward on the front tire side. Very strange way to bend. Bent towards the truck.Dissappointed that its already broken."
3,Bolts are made of monkey-metal.,"The unit is made/manufactured in CHINA. For the cost-reduction benefit of having a Chinese national TIG-weld the rack, the maker should be able to throw in AT LEAST GRADE 5 bolts to hold (at least) the anti-sway device in place. They know that it costs you more to send everything back than to go to the hardware store and buy MADE IN THE USA grade 5 (or better yet, grade 8) bolts. The bolts they supply with the unit are grade 4, which are a waste of time/investment for all parties involved. If you love your bike like any moto-crosser should, don't trust the inferior grade bolts (read: monkey metal) they slip into the box. Realize this before you trust the unit and have it bend or break w/ your precious ride strapped to it, unless you're looking to get insurance $$$ for the mishap."
5,Great carrier for the money.,I have had this carrier for two months and used it about 10 times. As of now I could not be more pleased with the stability and ease of operation. I have a CR250 that I carry on the back of a Ford Escape and would feel very comfortable driving long distances. I have not tried one of the more expensive designs but for someone on a budget I would recommend it highly.
3,It works,"This items is very lightweight. It does fit our Suzuki 250, length wise, but the ramp is very short and I nearly had a heart attack when we put the bike up there - the tires are a little wider than the ramp would prefer and the aluminum rack bent under the 310 pounds. It held and it's an easy, inexpesive rix for hauling our bike but hard to get the bike up there."
5,Sturdy. I can tie a dirt bike by myself. It Works flawlessly.,"I use it to carry a 150cc dirt bike every weekend on a 60 mile trip that includes 5 miles of open roads. It works very nice. I believe is not intended for open roads so I don't push it there. I'm an average 40 years old man and I can push my bike into the ramp and tie it without help. Once it's up the ramp, I lean the bike against the truck while I tie it up. It doesn't include straps or a pin for the trailer. When I'm done using it I can carry it on my shoulder and store it in a garage. The bolts to secure the bike broke when tighten to much but I could replace them very easily for shorter ones that resist better the torque. Colombia, South America."
2,Decent Rack. Poor Ramp,"Have had this rack for a little over a year. Not bad. Rage rates the rack/ramp at 400 lbs., but don't believe it. While loading a wrecked 325 lb. bike, (which probably weighed closer to 300 lbs due to missing parts) the ramp taco'd like aluminum foil. I've tried contacting Rage 3 times about this and cannot get a response. I guess I'll just have to buy a ramp from someone else and modify it for use with this rack...and I will never buy another product from them ever again."
3,Good for Newbies,"If you've just 'come out', this book is a good guide for learning about yourself and other women. Issues like casual sex versus monogamy, singlhood versus coupledness, disability and std's are covered - Loulan works hard to address the ways in which the dominant society impacts on self-image, while making it clear that lesbian culture has its own norms/mandates that sometimes confine individuality.If you aren't new to the lesbian world, you won't find much here that you didn't already know. Loulan tries to cover every imaginable topic and, in so doing, forsakes depth for breadth."
4,Great story,"The two other stories in this book are ok, but A River Runs Through it is wonderful! The scenery is staggering and the story is beautiful. This book really made me think of my late little brother, he reminded me a lot of Paul.I think that we all view our siblings in some sort of low key hero-worship kind of way because we share some of the same genes. You view them as what you could be (or could have been)even if you are smarter and more successful. I have not seen the movie, but I really want to now. Great story!"
3,An upgrade from 2004,"I bought Pyro5 to address some issues I have with Pyro 2004, only to find that some trouble spots came over with the newer program. Pyro5 will not recognize titles on a CD I want to rip from. I had trouble getting this burn a CD and it took a couple of emails from cakewalk tech support to get this to work.I have to give the tech department good reviews, however."
1,GARBAGE SOFTWARE,"GOING IN CIRCLES TRYING TO INSTALL THIS CRAP ON WINDOWS 7. WILL NOT INSTALL, WILL NOT ACCEPT SERIAL NUMBER. ASKED MANUFACTURER FOR HELP, THEIR SOLUTION TO RIGHT CLICK ON LAUNCH ICON DOES NOTHING, SOOOOOOO, DO NOT GET THIS SOFTWARE, IT'S FLAWED BIG TIME WITH NO SUPPORT FROM THE COMPANY. AND, I BOUGHT THE TURNTABLE FOR NOTHING BECAUSE W/O THE SOFTWARE I CANNOT BURN VINYL TO DISC OR DOWNLOAD INTO COMPUTER. SHAME ON AUDIO-TECHNICA FOR INCLUDING THIS JUNK SOFTWARE WITH A QUALITY TURNTABLE."
5,Nice for that price,"Nice, comfortable, leather collar. Good quality. I ordered 2 of these and they were shipped in single package at my request (which seems to be a problem to most companies). I'm planning to order bigger versions once my Fila grows (guess I'll be ordering weekly, since she doubles in size every other day)."
4,Had its day...,"Bought this sound card as it one of the few at the time to support 192khz, while not costing me an arm and leg.Forgot why i needed it and what I was developing at the time..."
4,Serious sound for your computer.,The original driver for this card was somewhat buggy in terms of multi-channel playback. FINALLY there is a new and improved version with great ASIO function which is also Vista compatible. The RCA digital output will support 192 kHz as well as Dolby and DTS pass-through. Sadly the card is now out of production.
5,Really Nice Walking Shoes,I am very happy with these shoes. I work on concrete floors and these give great support but don't look like typical walking shoes. I chose the gray suede and couldn't be happier with this purchase.
2,May not be comfortable,"Unfortunately, I do not feel comfortable NB926 this model looks too big, black is not very attractive."
3,Disappointed!,I have another Manhasset stand and it's fine. I wanted one that could break down and go in the Voyager bag. The bolt that holds the feet onto the pole can only be tightened part way because there is no way to keep the part it screws into from turning when you turn the bolt. Since I don't dare remove the feet from the pole the stand doesn't fit all the bag so it's very difficult to carry.
3,Great Grands and their Dad Loved this one!,"I chose this rating as I live more than 800 miles away from my grandson and his children. I played chess with the 9 year old and the 6 year old when I visited in the early fall. Though I beat them, I was impressed with what they already knew. They and their father, my daughter's only child, told me they liked the book, were studying it, and were hoping to beat me the next time!!!!"
2,Once over lightly,"For a complete beginner, this book is OK, otherwise I think people are going to find it light on the details. Of course, it's the details that are hard to discover and get right.Also, space was devoted to topics that are not really germane, like CVS, Emacs and vi. Of course one has to edit DocBook files, but devoting 3 chapters (out of 12 total) seems like padding."
1,Fluff and Errors,"Save your money and spend your time on the Linux Documentation Project web site.This book does not contain a single useful detail on how to install and configure the software used to render documents, so make sure you're using a distribution of Linux which includes the tools. Windows users are out of luck.None of the Chapter 5 example links work on the CD-ROM. The examples in the book and on the CD-ROM are not very complete or useful. The book and CD seem slapped together without organization or quality control. I'm sorry I bought it."
5,Just about my favorite children's book,"This may very well be my favorite children's book, and I own hundreds. It is exquisitely illustrated and amazingly fun to read. All three of my boys have loved it, and after reading it many times I am not tired of it (perhaps a more telling recommendation!). Over in the Meadow ranks right up there with Make Way for Ducklings, Ox Cart Man and Peter Rabbit. A must own."
5,Cute Book!,"This is a cute book which was recommended to me by a speech therapist. At the time, I bought this for an 18 month toddler. Not only does the author use rhymes in his storytelling but the author uses numbers to depict the animals in the meadow. Your toddler will be able to count the different animals in the meadow. This is a good book that you and your toddler will enjoy."
5,Works well on my good knives,The sharpening system works very well on my good knives and even made my mediocre knives much better. It is expensive but good quality.
3,"Nice Idea, but Still Based on a Flawed Premise","This product is supposed to take the guesswork out of knife-sharpening by properly controlling the sharpening angle. Unlike the standard-issue sharpening rod included with most knife sets, this gadget is designed to guide the knife perfectly at the correct angle to ensure a uniform, precision edge every time.While the concept is a real winner, its creators chose to ignore one prominent flaw - the user is still required to freehand the knife across the spring-loaded sharpeners. This leaves the knife wide open to variances in travel angle, pitch, arc, etc., leading to a less-than-perfect edge. There is literally nothing to guide the knife accurately across the sharpening fingers, defeating the chief purpose of the $100 contraption.After realizing mediocre results, I promptly returned my unit. Do yourself a favor; save your money until Furi gets it right."
5,Does the Job,Sharpens very well and extremely easy to use. I keep it on counter to use every time I use a knife.
4,Knife sharpening,My wife used to complain about her dull knives. I would sharpen them and a few days later she would complain again. Now she can touch them up herself whenever she feels the need.
1,"nice gimmick, but not a nice sharpener","The hype and sales pitch sounds great, but this is far from great. I tried it out on a couple of my cheaper knifes to test it first. I had a dull knife and brought back a decent edge, then I used the diamond fingers and ended up with a blunt edge. Hmmmm.... lets try the honing fingers. nothing.... I tried to hone another knife... nothing... pulled out my steel and achieved a nice sharp edge. The Furi is junk! A pro knife sharpening system. I don't know on professional cook who uses this peice of crap... don't waste your time or money."
5,Best Sharpener ever!,"I've tried almost every sharpener made, from manual to electric, and none come close to the TechEdge Pro. As soon as I received it, I sharpened all of my straight edged knifes, and the edges came out far superior than when new. As I do the majority of the cooking, all knifes are used on a daily basis, and I have yet to have to even run one through the honer. Great product, and I definitely recommend it to everyone who has ""kitchen duty!""Cort Boyd"
2,It's just OK,"I thought this would be a good easy way to keep my Henckel knives sharp. It does an OK job, but I don't think the material on the sharpener is hard enough to do a decent job on a good quality knife.Bottom line, not a lot of bang for the buck. Sorry Rachael, but you should have your people do a little more testing before you put your name on it."
5,Best Sharpener Ever,I received this Sharpener after seeing the video demonstration that was included with my Furi knives. I pulled out my dullest knife and it sharpened it just like new in a matter of minutes. I was able to sharpen my entire block in no time.It is set up where you get the correct angle to sharpen your knife and you do not have to try to work with a stone for hours. You get your moneys worth the 1st day when all your knives just like brand new.
4,Great for small dogs!,"Don't be fooled by the fact this bed is considered large. It is not very large, but it is perfect for dogs up to 20lbs. I have already washed it once, and it held up great. I would recommend this bed to anyone who has a small dog or a puppy."
3,WHERE'S THE CUSHION?,I ORDERED 2 BEDS FOR MY LHASA APSO AND MY COCKER SPANIEL FOR XMAS. IT HAS BEEN ONLY 2 WEEKS AND THE BED CUSHIONS ARE FLAT. THEY GO SLEEP WITH MY BLACK LAB IN HIS BED THAT I BOUGHT IN TARGET. THE PICTURE LOOKED BETTER. OH WELL...
4,Cute and comfy,My beagles love the large size. The sides and padding get kind of flattened and packed down but it fluffs up well.
5,Fantastic Dog Bed,"This bed is great! I have a 2 year old Miniture Aussie that is a new addition to our home. He had never really slept in a ""bed"" before but took to this soft pet bed straight away. He sleeps on his back, wraps around and stays in it all night.He loves it!The quality seems to be super. It cleans up nice and fluffs back up every morning.I would buy another in a minute."
5,Wonderful Book for anyone interested in Mules!,Read it all the way through and then gave two copies to friends! Well researched and really interesting!!
4,A Mule Owners darn Good Read!,"John Hauer is a hero of mine and this book is one of the best ideas (and as I understand this man history) one of hundreds that really works well. It is a collection of anecdotes, historical facts and wonderful photographs and prints. It's also a monument to the great American Mule Culture that mule owners around the world have come to admire and respect. My only criticism is that the brief to each of those contributing could have been specific, and then their contribution proof read to weasel out the repetition about mule reproduction etc. But all in all a nodal piece of modern mule related literature."
1,Westminster Abbey - The lesser side,"Unorganized, somewhat choppy and no overall theme. This will appeal to the diehard Abbey fan (admittedly few in the US like me) but as an example of what the Abbey can aspire to, this is a disappointment.I have e-mailed the Abbey directly and asked for re-masterings of the great occasions and they have no plans....so we wait for the real thing that makes them soar....."
4,Before the Legendary Journeys...,"Considering they used pretty much the same production team as they did with H:TLJ, it was okay. No it wasn't the same, but it was close. This is before Hercules had his legendary journeys. It shows young Herc trying to impress his father and forging an unlikely friendship with Ioalus to help their new friend Jason, heir to the throne of Corinth. With the same crew that brought us ""HTLJ"" & ""XWP"" it's perfect.Kevin Smith as Ares, Michael Hurst as a jeweler, & Meighan Desmond as Discord make appearances."
2,Dont do it,"I was an original fan of the series Hercules but this movie is pretty cheesy, and definitely b or even c level production. I would not watch it again."
4,Great gift for a beginner to a pro gardener,I initially saw this book in the bookstore and was going to buy it for my boyfriend's mom & grandmother. I was hesitant about buying this for them so I ordered this book for his mom and another gardening organizer for his grandma. When I received this book I was quite happy with it.The spiral bound is great because it will hold up through wear & tear. The journal is sectioned by season so it doesn't matter if the gardener is a beginner or a master. Each section is divided by a seed envelope which I really liked.Overall I think this was a great gift.
4,Excellent - straight to the point.,Excellent book and an easy read. Just received it yesterday afternoon and already finished it. It is straight and to the point and not filled with a lot of extra fluff. Looking forward to putting the information into practice.
4,I have a question,"Have you ever seen or met satan? If you have then where is he? I've never even seen a picture of him except in cartoon drawings and as a matter of course I've never seen a real picture of god either, so they're just cartoon drawings and neither one of them really exists. They're invisabke therefore I get the whole genre thing and it's made up in order to get you to buy products.They are an excellent band though, and love the way they play even if they do just throw it together."
2,not well made,I dropped it once and the clasp broke that keeps the CD cover closed so it no longer works unless i use scotch tape to keep it closed. Not very practical. Not worth the effort to ship back and get it fixed.
5,Psychic Medium Karyn Reece's perspective on Body Electric,This is a fascinating book that explains the relationship between the human body and the body's electrical system. I highly recommend this book for those in the healing arts and for those who are simply interested in understanding the correlations between good health and the body's electrical system.
2,The Body Electric,"The information was not what I expected in regard to a misleading title. Anyone in the acupuncture field, as I am, should not be persuaded to buy this book. It basically deals with reptilian experiments done 50 or more years ago. It is a biology book, in a sense. I wish I had not purchased it!"
5,Compulsory read for any science geek,"This is an amazing book well ahead of its time, and extremely important to anyone who is interested in healing, both the planet and ourselves."
1,A review of the reviews,"With the exception of a few, the overwhelming majority of reviews of this book seem to just echo the book itself. There is a tone of confirmation bias in all of these reviews. It would appear that the majority of people who read this book were ready to believe in some far-reaching, institutional conspiracy and this book just feeds that need."
5,Got a body? You need this book!,This contains the secret of life - exactly how your body works so you can look after your trillion little cells. Suitable for anyone with even the most rudimentary grasp of highschool science. After you read it also watch the HHMI Christmas lectures on stemcells and check out the TED talks lecture by Dr. Steven Badylack
4,Great book with lots of valuable information,"This is a really good book if you are serious about audio power amplifier construction. It contains a lot of background information that is essential when you want to learn this particular field of wizardry. It does not contain any diy projects but instead gives you some of the fundament that is needed to start creating your own designs. When you have read the book it still remains useful as a reference. I find myself coming back to it time after time, a great book."
2,It was never that insightful...,"It was poorly written, obvious, and uninteresting back in the olden days of the last millennium. It hasn't gotten more interesting with age.Obvious and dull."
2,Nothing new...,"Well, I agree pretty much with the only negative review I saw here...Linux and FreeBSD have been around for a while now, they're only recently getting popular and moving in the mainstream and everybody is jumping on the bandwagon. Microsoft bashing isn't new either, but somehow it's become the cool thing to do. Some of the essays are well written but as with the other reviewer I don't see why the author is as popular as he is in the community. The book is a good primer for the latecomers who want to join the hype and the circus."
1,Lazy journalism,"The author proposes some interesting ideas. However it's difficult to evaluate them, because he simply makes claims and doesn't bother to back up his ideas with research and evidence. Most first-year college students can write better than this."
1,Important but misguided book,"The Open Source movement had done for Computer Science what Creationism tried to to to the field of Biology. A political mass movement that has turned many in the field against the computer industry. For academics, this dogmatic illogical movement is nevertheless appealing, because it offers an opportunity to situate intellectuals and ""hackers"" into a false position of importance in the history and evolution of the computer industry."
3,OSS Business Model,"The major problem with this book is that ER NEVER reallydiscusses the ""business model"" used by the ""software"" industrywhich is more of a form racketeering and money launderingthan any legitimate model. Since he does not do this anddoes not offer a viable alternative business model - hedoomed open source to a quick death. Had he taken thisissue more seriously,Enron,WorldCom,Auther Andersen and Perigrinedebacles might have been avoided."
4,Great Book !,"Raymond does a very good job of explaining the pros of the open source model. His work is a little weak in explaining the other side. In the essay ""The Magic Cauldron"" He asks what are the payoffs ? He does only a moderate job of portraying the strengths of the closed source approach.Having read ""The hiistory of the Internet"" several times I thought that the chapter ""A breif History of Hackerdo"" would be a yawn fest but it was very interesting. I would still disagree with many of the conclusions Raymond draws, especially about the economics and business case of open source but I found his analyisis of the motivations of hackers very interesting. In all I liked the work very much.The work is very well written and well thought out. It gives the strengths of the open source approach very well. It also gives a lot of insights into ""Hackerdom"" and ""Hackers""If you are interested in a book on Open SOurce This is a very good read."
5,Absolute Gold. A Book All Should Read,"The methods for development detailed within this book extend far beyond software development. Dealing strictly with software development, though, this book does an excellent job discussing open source and closed source software, as well as motivations for open source projects and tidbits on hackerdom. Having met Eric Raymond myself, I know his works are genuine and powerful. The material in this book is what caused Netscape to open source their Web browser. Anybody who questions the ideals and motives of open source and wishes to learn more about this increasingly popular software production model should read this book. That being said, buy it!"
5,Essential book for anyone interested in Free / Open-Source,"Simply put, this should be required reading for anyone interested in Free / Open-Source Software. In fact, I'd go on to say that it should be required reading by the second year of any Computer Science curriculum. Even if you have no intentions of developing (i.e. you're a development manager) or of diverging from the corporate cathedral way of making software, you should at least undertand alterative approaches so that you can identify the benefits and limitations of each.On the other hand, if you're interested in not only understanding Free/OSS but also in participating in it, read this, then ""The Unix Philosophy"" and then ""Open Source Development with CVS"". C'mon in and join the fun!"
3,Good book but definitely not a classic,I felt the book had some good points and then other times I was struggling to get myself to pick it back up. Overall worth the read but not in my top 5 list by any means.
4,"More analysis than manifesto, and better for it","The cult-like status of this book and its Web antecedents in the Linux community isn't surprising. But even for those of us who aren't staunch open-source partisans, it's a surprisingly well-argued (if a bit scattered) and concise collection.Taken as a whole, the book makes a series of good business cases for when opening the source code to software is appropriate and potentially profitable -- as well as maximally efficient. I was pleased that Raymond acknowledges that open source is _not_ always the best way to go, even while noting that it will probably be more prevalent over time.Raymond's fervour about open source shows through, particularly late in the book, but it doesn't detract from the largely objective analyses he makes -- so his arguments carry force.Worth reading for anyone who's a programmer, a hacker, or interested in the politics of the software business. Or anyone else, for that matter."
5,Dynamite!,"Eric Raymond is not only a brilliant thinker, he's also a damn fine writer -- and one of the more interesting human beings I've had the good fortune to encounter. This is his core stuff. Not to be missed by anyone with an interest in the future of the computer industry."
3,Good Book for basic understanding,This book was very reader friendly and would be great for someone that doesnt know alot about cats. Its short and basic. There is a chapter on why cats hiss and the authur advised that cats hissed because they were trying to sounds like a snake since most animals fear snakes. Thats alittle hard to belive... thats like saying dogs growl because theyre trying to sounds like a bear or something. Dont buy that to much but the rest of the book was good.
4,Great book!,This is a great book for English majors and writers. I love Peter Elbow's style and his ideas about writing.
2,Terribly Disappointed,"Been a long time waiting for the opportunity to get this zoom lens based on reviews. It's my first L series lens and once received was horribly disappointed in the results. Based on the number of others who have shared they had excellent sharp results (even hand-held), I must have received a poor quality lens. The build date was Aug 2011 according to the stamp on the lens. Testing from 100m to 400m on and off a tripod, all results were soft or out of focus. My Canon D60 kit lens (18-135mm) produces much sharper images than this professional L series lens. I am returning for refund as I'm a bit leery now of trying for a replacement. I sure hope this isn't the quality of all newer builds with this particular lens."
2,I keep my 70-200 F/4,"This lens is anything from being sharp at 400mm and auto focus is not very precise. I bought this lens for a trip to Costa Rica and many photos turned out unusable, and few are OK. To get this lens somewhat OK at 400mm range, you need to shoot at F8 or F11, because F5.6 is just too soft. I have done test with my Canon 70-400 F/4 L lens compared to 100-400mm lens, both shot at far end of zoom, and 70-200f/4 resulted in better sharpness at F4 at the same crop size! I don't need couple stops of stabilization, auto focus works properly, bokeh looks the same, I have flexibility with crop and I saved myself $1200 and my shoulders for carrying heavier lens. Sold my 100-400mm lens on eBay few days ago. I use 5D Mark II, but I believe crop sensor will have similar results. Hope this was helpful. I only wish I would do the same test before I left to Costa Rica. Darn it. ....and just to mention, I did compared this lens to my friends, just to make sure it wasn't a lemon from eBay."
5,5 stars for what it was made to do,"Soft wide-open, but better than any non-L lens (any mfr; tried a bunch) in this zoom range. Sharpens up very well; jury is out, because it stays in the bag only if with a 1.4x Extender it can deliver something sharp for outdoor sports and wildlife in good light. Don't expect a miracle; if you must shoot stop-action indoors/difficult light and cannot tolerate the noise of using high ISO, save your euros for a prime.Ah, but HUGE plus: You can handhold this lens, and you get used to the push/pull zoom.Note: If you're not SURE you need to get to 400mm, take a long, hard look at owning only a 70-200 f/2.8 IS + 1.4x Extender.Read all of the reviews in here -- Kudos to Amazon because these reviews are among the best I've seen, even from the dedicated vid/camera sites."
4,"now that's SHARP, but be carefull","I love this lens, I think its fairly priced for the amazing image quality. I use a canon 60D. The resolution of this lens easily outpaces the body. But resolution isn't everything, the color is also great and the image stabilization is very effective. Down side is that its heavy. Now, I did have some major trouble with it, something went wrong with it and the images were soft, so I had to send it back to canon. $600 later I was back in business, they said it was something to do with the autofocus (even though the problem persisted in manual). It was a problem that developed over time instead of in one instant. On a side note, do all that you can to avoid Canon service, it's horrible and I've had nothing but problems with simple things like body cleanings."
3,Great Lens but a dust Eater,"I am not a pro, and i have been having alot of Fun with this lens that's why i gave it the 3 stars... but the problem with it is that it just eats alot of dust when you zoom around, and even small pieces of glass if you are not careful... if i was a pro photographer i would have give it a 1 star because a pro should not be having this type of problems with dust in his pictures... i would buy it again for half the price... but i would never recommend it to any one."
2,Not so pro lens,"I am not impressed with this lens. The 100-400 is just as sharp as the cheaper Canon 75-300 lens. The other thing that bugs me is when using the 1.4x with the 100-400 is...you have no auto focus. Yet, if I put a cheap close up tube on the 100-400 I have auto focus. Go figure. For the money that one pays for this lens and 1.4x you should get auto focus and a shaper image. I've used Canon for years starting with the Canon FTb and F-1. The cameras and glass, in my opinion, were superior then. It makes me want to switch to Nikon or Pentex."
3,"Excellent lens quality, but heavy and increases maintenance","This is an excellent lens. We bought it because my husband enjoys action photography and I enjoy wildlife photography. The lens quality is excellent and the zoom is very handy, however there are some disadvantages. This lens is very large and requires a sturdy tripod, hence the tripod mount built into the lens. The bellows function that allows the zoom tends to blow dust into the sensor, increasing the maintenance required on any camera used with this lens. When used with a doubler, this lens can only be focused manually. Also, this is an f4.5-5.6 lens, which is adequate for bright light, but frustrating in many situations when you're used to f2.8 or better."
4,Sharp! But don't like push-pull,"Got this lens last week and just came back from a shoot with it in Salton Sea and Joshua Tree Park areas. Results are superb!Only negative (besides obvious weight -- will build your muscles!) is the push-pull focus. Maybe I am just not used to it, but I really prefer the ring focus of every other lens I have. That is the only reason for a loss of a star here."
4,Very nice lens,I do like this lens but it is at times tough to get 'great' pictures out of it. Under the right conditions and good light (fast enough shutter speed) it will take some very nice pictures. I use it on my 5D Mark II and I am pretty happy with it. Part of the reason is because the 5D II is so good at higher ISO! I originally used this on an XSi and in good light it would take good pics but was tough in lower light. It offers great reach and with the 5D II I can use higher ISO's to keep the shutter speeds up. I am happy with the size of this lens for reach that it offers but it sure will get some attention when it is extended out to 400mm with a hood on it! IS works good and so does the focus tracking.Some examples taken with this lens and a 5D II including some birds in flight while focus tracking. Click on 'all sizes' above pic to view large:[...]
5,Dohn git mutch bettor!!!!!!!! Best lens I've ever used...bar none!,"I've stayed away from bird photography for many, many years because my lenses hadn't had the reach this 100-400 does. But besides that, the quality of my lenses didn't match that of this baby. It truly stands by itself as a wildlife lens. There are longer ones, priced close to a king's ransom, but for portability and razor sharp exposures, it stands alone. It focuses fast and sure. Coupled with my 20D -- my friend has one on his 30D -- it is a surefire combo."
2,Disappointing Canon Product,"This was the first Canon product (camera,lens,extender, etc.) that I was truly disappointed in having. First of all, the ""sliding"" design of the zoom is a minus. The one I received, when angled down at all, caused it to zoom,(but it slid smoothly!). The quality wasn't there for me, compared to the Sigma 120-400 at $600 less. I tried both lenses at the same time, and ended up sending the Canon back."
4,Almost great,"Very happy with the sots, but it got mold inside just a few days after I arrived in a trip to centralamerica cause the humidity."
4,"heavy $$$ lens, but not that great","I'm glad that I order this lens through Amazon as I can return it without any trouble.The lens is very heavy for my family member, for me it's is ok as I put it on monopod. The lens was smooth and easier to handle than my Sigma 170-500 ( I compared at 400mm focal lens for both lenses). I like Sigma designed the ring that I can easily remove when sigma lens was attached to camera. Canon ring (include) can not be removed while lens attached to camera.Images: this lens gave much better image than my sigma 170-500mm (may be because of IS?); however, there is not much different between Canon this pro canon lens vs my 70-300 canon IS lens, or atleast with my eyes. The 100-400mm does have the feeling that it was build for the tank rolls over it (feel like metal lens).I sent it back to Amazon as the images were not much different from Canon 70-300 IS II lens. Try it before at local camera shop before you buy. I gave it **** as it not the best value lens for the money."
2,"Images nice, but way too soft, no fine detail","I purchased, and have since returned this lens. It is built well, and seemed to work well also. I found the images too soft, with little to no fine detail. Such as for birds or trees. The leaves would seem to just be a leaf, but without detail. I was unhappy with the softness with nature photos also. I had some doves in the backyard, and shot many photos, only to see they were o.k. images, but way too soft, especially for the close distance. I tried many aperatures, and focal lengths. Sure, at 400mm zoom, it gets worse. I personally think this was a bad lens, and will try another. Amazon should pack a little better, as this len's box was inside a bigger box with hardly anything to keep it from being knocked around during shipment. Come on amazon, too cheap to pack better than that?"
4,A versatile lens with one drawback,"This lens is great! I took it backpacking in the wilderness and to Yellowstone for the classic bear, bison, teton pictures. The images are better than any I have taken previously. I am excited to blow some of these up!The drawback: obviously you only have about 2 true f-stops to start with. Shooting in the dark is possible, but takes a little more finesse considering the lack of f-stops.Seriously, otherwise this lens is worth the money and a must-have for all true wildlife photographers. I am hoping to take it to Africa next year. I can't wait to see what it can do there!"
5,Very good lens,"Got great pics with this lens. Took it out for a one week safari earlier this month and the pics were the best I have ever taken. One minor complaint -- wish it has a lock, as it so big and heavy, that without a lens lock, it sometimes can slide out unexpectedly."
4,"Expensive, but great photos","Having gone through the Canon 75-300mm and 70-300 IS lenses, I decided to finally bite the bullet and pick up the 100-400mm to replace the others. I have not been disappointed in the quality of the lens and resulting photos. The push-pull takes a little getting used to, and I still don't particularly like the way the locking ring works, but those are minor annoyances to achieve the results this lens has delivered."
5,Now this is a lens,This lens with a 2X matching extender is what I have always wanted.It is a little heavy but worth every ounce. If my arms get tired I use a monopod.
2,Not for everyone,This lens is great for cropped sensor cameras but is useless on the full frame 5DMark II based on the out of focus results. Sending back to canon did nothing to resolve this problem. I've spoken to other photographers while taking pictures at Bristkecone Pine Forest and they also had the exact same results as I including attempts to have canon fix this problemOn the 50D camera body I'm extremely pleased with the results.
4,"Very, very heavy! No kidding.","I was surprised how heavy it was when I received the package from UPS. I wanted a long zoom lens, and this one is over 3 lbs - Heavy and Bulky. I have a monopod, but this lens is killing both of my wrists and my shoulders. I used it for couple times, then packed it away...However, absolutely amazing photos."
5,Very good in bright light!,"I've only had this lens for a few days and I will say it has impressed me. It does have drawbacks, needs lots of light and is somewhat heavy. I would not like to carry all day,but for my need it isn't a problem.I have a couple of photos on display taken the first day I purchased the lens . It was a very overcast day and I think they turned out reasonable for the weather. My test at home when the sun popped out were outstanding. As for the push and pull adjustment I see no problem with it.I think with a little more experience it will be a very good purchase for my budget. I know there are higher quality lens but price becomes an issue,when you are a amature hobbiest like I am.I would recommend for any one who likes to take wildlife photos. The 5 star rating is for the money and quality it is a very good lens!"
4,Great lens but its heavy,Its been a great experience and I am carrying it around since I bought it. But its heavy and is a really bulky carry on package.
1,Do not buy!!!,"I just called Semprae to cancel a membership that I never requested. Just called the company for a sample 2 weeks ago and now I am being charged $49.95 for a box of oil that I do not want. I can only hope that I will get the refund I have been promised. I have tried the product and had a horrible burning sensation that would not cease. Had to literally keep cold water on the area to get some relief. DO NOT BUY,DO NOT ORDER A SAMPLE, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!! And the customer service rep I talked to today about cancelling this crap was rude!"
1,Bad Billing Practices and it doesnt even work,"I ordered this product and was sent the trial 3-pack. Then, as others have stated, I shortly received a large box of them, and charged $50 for the product that I didnt authorize. I never did get a refund.As far as product performance goes, this was a HUGE let down. Whereas others have stated they felt only a ""warming"" sensation, I felt a BURNING sensation. This did NOT subside even after a thorough showering, and cleansing of the area with soap and water. I threw the product out."
1,Description is a Lie,"The product description includes the box dimensions and 10.4 ounces.The 10.4 ounces is NOT shipping weight, since the shipping weight is separately listed as 1 pound.What came is three flat packets with a trace of oil in each; there definitely was NOT 10.4 ounces of product.The box with the three foil packets was not more than an ounce of cardboard and advertising.Definite fraud!!!!"
1,awful!!!,"I have never posted a review before, but just couldn't help myself on this one...such a waste and the smell of the product reminds me of latex gloves...this hardly provides a sensual sense of being...disgusting, those commercials are bogus. I called Zestra and the attitude was, ""well, it works on 7 out of 10 women""."
1,Better stuff out there...,"I was excited to try this... almost cried from the disappointment. First of all, it smells horrible. Like.. rotten pork mixed with plastic. And as if the smell wasn't off putting enough, after application I felt like I had fire crotch! Sex is normally enjoyable but I was looking for that ""wow"" factor, and this just made it complete misery. I never opened the second sample packet. So, imagine my SHOCK when I recieved a whole box of it in the mail, then a $50 charge on my credit card. I waited too long to return it so I wasn't able to get my money back, but BEWARE that you're enrolled in a progam if you ask for samples. As for my box of Zestra.... it went straight into the garbage. Personal opinion... KY Intense works better and doesn't burn like heck."
2,Duh!,"Zestra's instructions say to massage the oils onto the female genitalia at least 5 minutes before. Um....... sorry but I'm thinking that 5 minutes of ""massaging"" is what is really working along with the mindset of having an orgasm. All the oil does is provide a bit of heat.Seriously underwhelmed."
3,"Works, then burns","This product does work, but expect a burning sensation after a little while. I had to run to the shower to wash it off!"
1,ZESTRA - TRIED AND FAILED,"My wife stated it was like rubbing kerosene on herself and lighting it.In addition we were enrolled, without our knowledge, to order a $49.95 package.When we saw the charge on our checking statement we had to threaten legal action before they would issue a ""Return Material Authorization"".(RMA)"
1,Disgusting smell!,"I am not sure how anyone can get past the awful smell of this product. It literally smells like a fast food restaurant. To top it off, it didn't have the WOW factor I was hoping for. Total disappointment."
1,Unethical billing practices,"If you order a sample, for which you supposedly only pay $4.95 for shipping, you are automatically enrolled in receiving a monthly order made without your awareness for $49.95. It will take numerous phone calls and email messages to get Semprae to stop billing you. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau."
1,Adverse reaction,"ZEStra-I ordered this based on my Oncologists recommendation.It burned severely, inside after using.I need to return it, but don't know where to send it.I am so dissapointed I spent 70 dollars on it!Please advise.L C"
2,shorter than specified,"This ladder is only 4 1/2 ft. as a step ladder(A-frame) and it's 6 1/2 ft. high as an extension ladder. It claims to be a 6 1/2 ft. A-frame and 10 ft. extension ladder but it is not.Bringing it down is difficult because lowering each side independently is not functionally easy for a few reasons.I sent it back and ordered an extend & climb for less money, extends a foot higher, has a clip-onhand-tote/carrier and is easier to bring up and down."
2,Looks good but stains immediately,"Has nice texture and good looks, heavy duty and good size for my small oven. HOwever, I baked cinnamon rolls on it tonight, spraying olive oil on the surface, baking the rolls at 425 for 10 minutes. Rolls came out fine, but the cookie sheet was stained by the cinnamon on the rolls combined with the olive oil on the sheet. I soaked it and rubbed it with a Dawn-soaked sponge and the stains are there to stay. A big disappointment! I bought this to replace another teflon cookie sheet that worked fine but looked bad and now this one is on its way to looking equally horrible. Don't buy it if you care about its looks."
5,does the job,"This cookie sheet is great. Fits a normal cookie recipe, so easy to clean and I don't have to grease the pan when baking cookies. Just the right heaviness. Thinking of ordering more!"
5,good price and fast delivery.,A good sturdy pan and is easy to clean. Good value and a good price. Easy to remove the cookies.
5,Don't miss it,"The title of this book doesn't even begin to cover the full range of the story. It's rare that a book really transports me, this one did. Page by page I fell deeper in love with the characters and their joys and triumphs brought tears to my eyes. An excellent read."
3,Heart of a Knight,Recommend. Three stars because four are for you don't want the story to end and five are for the ones you read over and over.
4,Love the time period,I enjoyed this book and thought the author did a good job. It was a sweet love story with just enough spice. Well written.
5,Wonderful Historical Romance,Barbara Samuel draws in the reader with both vivid characters and just the right flavoring to bring the history to life. I particularly liked that even those characters who are not the most admirable turned out to be just people trying to do the best they could for themselves and not cardboard cutouts. A fabulous gift read.
4,Good read,"Started out a little iffy, but turned out to be wonderful! I truly enjoyed the characters and although the ending was predictable it was still exciting."
5,"Well done, Ms. Samuel!","This is the second book I've read by Ms. Samuel (the first was Bed of Spices, also fantastic) and it didn't disappoint!I don't like to re-write the back cover description, because I'd rather you read the book! I really like the formula she seems to follow for the historical reads, e.g. a few ups and downs, light suspense, then heavier suspense etc. but what I really enjoy is the romance factor. The love scenes are really well done, and the book doesn't rely on the scenes to carry it through. The characters and story have a strong enough background that the sex scenes are just a bonus! (Which speaks highly of a 'romance' novel.) I can't decide if I love or hate the amount of time it takes for the protagonists to act on their desires, I suppose it makes the story that much more exciting. Highly recommend!"
3,Displeased,"I was looking forward to this book after reading another one of Ms. Samuels amazing books. In the beginning the story was fine but as it progressed, I must admit that I lost interest. :("
1,Too detailed,"I bought this book on a whim. And although the author is a good writer, I was very turned off by the intimate details that she gives. I feel like they were way more than needs to be expressed. I was disappointed by that."
3,High Tension Book,"With a little editing, this book would easily be a five. First of all, the tension often held so long and came so closely on top of the last, I had to get up and walk away from it to give myself a break. Next, the love scenes were much too explicit. I would have been happier with less of the juicy details, because they left me feeling almost dirty. However, the story-line was enthralling, and the characters were rich and believable. Despite the fact it was hard to put down for long, if I had it to do over, I would not read it."
1,IT SHOULD BE FREE,Very thin pamphlet type book. Way too general in its information. Should be given away for free instead of having to pay for it..... Use the money you would have spent on buying this book/pamphlet and apply it to getting a good book on raising game birds.........
3,Raising game birds,The book was knowledgeable but simple. It could have been more thorough in details but all considered it was of average information and very general.
5,Beautiful,"I was so glad to find it arrived 2 or 3 days earlier than it said it would. As for the necklace itself, I love it. It adjusts nicely, and the design is just like it is in the picture. I would love it twice as much if the design had continued to the back of the pendant, but regardless, it's an awesome necklace, especially for the price. I don't regret wasting what little money I had to buy it. :P"
4,4 starred dragon,"I love this! It is quite the conversational piece. People are curious about it and where I brought it from. Looks better in person than on the computer screen. A good gift for those interested in dragons, the God Thor or even children of the Orisha Chango."
2,Dissapointing,"I just expected more from this product,it has no distinguishing feature, in my opinion.Unfortunately, this type of productcannot be returned, my fault forbuying something without testing it in person."
5,Saving in every way,"I love this product!I first purchased it on a cruise ship tax free.A year later, when looking for more, some stores weren't carrying it.I work in Chicago and Hugo Boss has its own store... but every where I looked, it was top price, plus tax.Searching online Amazon was sooooo much cheaper... no tax (I believe) and free shipping. Even the shipping which said it may not be shipped for more than a week and then the days it would take enroute... The bottle was in my hands in 3 days when I got home from work.Way to go Amazon!"
4,smells classy and not common,The smell is just great but wish it lasted little longer. Though it would linger for almost 4-5 hours. And not overpowering at all. I just hate colognes which are awfully strong.
5,I love it,I love it.It has a great fragrance.This was a preferred cologne but it seemed to be taken off the market for a while.Good stuff.
5,Truly a Great book.,"This a truly excellent book. If you like the Animorph Books, the Replica books, then you will definately find this a great Sci-Fi book. A definate keeper"
5,Buenisima!!,"Cuando la vi, estaba feliz porque me di cuenta que no habia perdido mi dinero, es de muy buena calidad y lo representa."
2,Archaic,This is not a book that will interest you if you are at all interested in what Zoroaster and the Parsi religion is all about. The script is archaic and leaves one rather bemused as to what the author was trying to convey.
3,Best for Typists,"As an admitted non-expert in the field of finding mates through handwriting analysis, I purchased this book expecting it would help me find my perfect match. Although it does contain some very helpful information re neuro-linguistic programming, I must have missed the bit on how to convince a woman to submit a writing sample to a handwriting expert."
2,A single book,"Although this book has only 64 pages, I thought that this book had more information about many exotic animals. However,this book is very single with a short information (Because it has big letters , it has less information that I expected) and I think It should cost less.It has color photos,some of them good, but however the information and photos are few."
2,A very single book,"Although this book has only 64 pages, I thought that this book had more information about many exotic animals. However,this book is very single with a short information (Because it has big letters , it has less information that I expected) and I think It should cost much less.It has color photos,some of them good, but I insist, the information and photos are few."
2,A very single book and expensive I think,"Although this book has only 64 pages, I thought that this book had more information about many exotic animals. But not!, this book is very single with a short information (wroten with big words.Therefore, it has less information that I expected) and I think it is expensive. It should cost less....It has color photos,some of them good, but I insist, the information and photos are few."
4,Wild Women in the White House,"I am about 3/4 through the book, but so far it has been very interesting. A suject hardly ever touched on, it give you insight to the history of the White House."
5,What's old is new again.,"Reading Autumn Stephens' Wild Women in the White House reminded me that what's old is new again. These wild tales of First Ladies and other women who've made their own impact (sometimes notorious impact) on the White House just goes to show anything coming out of our nation's head household is nothing to be shocked about. A great read. Lots of attention to detail, history, and mindful entertainment."
1,Very sleepy,"I enjoy the boost from motivational recordings and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a winner, but this book is neither. It is so sleepy that I could barely make it through the first tape. He does not tell of real life experiences, but continues with a barrage of ""remember this"" or ""try that"". He deals with depression, anxiety, worry, and guilt in only one half of one tape. The only good that can come from this recording is if you suffer from insomnia."
3,"offers a basic understanding, at least...","Not living up to its title ""The History of Religion"", this book is not much more than a very basic overview of the religions of the world. With each religion confined to two to ten or twelve pages, only the most basic fundamentals are really touched on, sections which certainly aren't extensive or comprehensive enough to really qualify the book as an actual history.Not living up to its claim as a history, though, doesn't change that this book does offer at least a (very) basic understanding of the various faiths and would work as a kind of introduction to the various religions. It just doesn't offer the depth that can be found in other texts on the subject of the world's religions, so I would definitely use it as only an introduction or supplementary kind of reference, with the intention of seeking a deeper understanding through those books which offer one...."
1,Coffe table book not for reading...,"The book has as much to offer on religion as the dictionary. The author's discussions and conclusions are little more than pop culture pap. Her very short discussion of Zoroastrianism (a religion?) is a discussion of the death arrangements of Freddie Mercury, the deceased singer of the pop band Queen.Similar conclusions could be drawn from future excavations of Barbie dolls as from her new age discussion of Mother Goddess. This book is a load of nothing."
1,Not Much,"This book is low on facts and high on opinions. It reads more like a High School assingnment paper than a book. I have not read any other books by this auhor and will not do so due to my disappointment after reading this one.In addition to being boring and not well written it seems the author has a problem with white Christians. I suspect the author is a product of the dead, white, male hating legion produced by so many American collegiate liberal arts programs.If you are a hairly legged, rally attending, man hating feminist, this book is for you. If not, you may want to skip it.It saddens me there isn't a no star option on this review form."
3,The Please disease,I liked this book especially since when my husband read into it he actually realized the truth in it. He is usually very opinionated and quite harsh when others do not agree with him. This book actually made him think!! That is good.
4,Quite helpful if you are like me,Feeling disempowered in relationships? You are not alone. This book has given me some of the tools and techniques to help me see where I can improve my life and how to do it. I was surprised at how acurately the author presents her case.
5,REMARKABLE,"Words can not explain the impact this book has had on my life. Nikki Rashan has captured the true feelings of thousands of people that are on this roller coaster called life. Decision making and life changing actions is pretty much what makes us human beings. Kyla's decision to make herself happy was phenomenal. This book made me laugh out loud, cry and even grip hold to my seat in anticipation of what was to happen next. I enjoyed this book so much that I can not wait until Kyla's next adventure called LIFE. This book surpasses 5 satrs."
1,Double Bad Double Worst,This Is the worst book i read so far. it just wasn't good to me & I really Just Couldn't get into it. Hope the Author Next Book WaY!!!! Better
2,Could of offered more,"The book was ok, but I so wanted more to happen. It was predictable. I read both parts and still was not impressed.Blahh to sum it up"
3,It was too slow......,"I decided to buy this book after reading several positive reviews but was slightly disappointed in Double Pleasure Double Pain! This read was entirely too slow and very predictable! The few love scenes that were told, were far from erotic! On to the sequel........."
2,"Ehh... you will make your money back from this book, but nothing great","Not much to review on this book. It really isn't AMAZING, but it has one or two points of good information, including the levels of play and such. It would be better to just get a different book, in my opinion. There were a few tells that I disagreed with, as well as some questions that they pose with no real answers. Long story short, this book won't hurt your game, but it won't take you to that next level, to be honest. I would not recommend this book for intermediate players. Beginner players should not be looking to tells before learning how to play effectively as a player first."
4,Good stuff,"This book isn't about strategy at all. It's about playing the players, and all the funky stuff they do. I haven't seen anything else like it (and I've read alot of poker books). It made me smile with recognition, as all the stuff I knew about how players act was on the page. A quick read and miles from the usual odds and outs!"
2,"5 STARS tracks, 2 STAR CD...buyer beware: this is a CD-R!!??","While it's very nice to have long-lost 80s disco/dance/electro tracks by TINA B., CHERI, PHYLLIS NELSON, WEEKS & CO and more on CD format, this collection is tained by the fact that when I finally received it and opened it...I discovered to my horror and disappointment this is a CD-R rather than an authentic SILVER CD!! Where does the label get off charging people full retail price for a CD-R?! C'mon, do the fans & collectors a favor and re-master this and put it out on a REAL CD!! Very misleading; but I'll still keep my copy, as these tracks are quite hard to find and strictly OOP!"
2,"ATTENTION , not CD, a CD-R","the collection is good but these is a recordable cd that is sold , with original booklet !!???."
1,too small,i ordered a x-large top and it MIGHT fit a 10 year old.fails to tell you they are slim fit.
4,Start of a Whole New Fad!!,"I think this CD really made Intocable popular. The cumbias are great, and the ballads will make you want to call up that special someone. It's a CD to have in the car with you! The songs are romantic & have great beats to them. I loved this CD! It's for true Intocable fans! You'll get hooked, if you're not already one. =)"
5,"Great sound, good price, and cute to boot","I got these to replace the Sonys that I was using with my IPod Shuffle - they were the type that curl around your ear & are suppsedly more stable for active use, but they didn't fit and eventually drove me crazy. The JVC Marshmallow caught my attention right away for 2 reasons: the soft memory foam ear piece and the color, which was a perfect match for my Shuffle. They were also $10-15 cheaper than the Sony in-ear headphones that I was considering. Since the reviews here were good, I thought I'd give them a go & wound up buying another pair in pink for my pink IPod Mini. The sound is great, good separation & dimension, and the design is wonderful for my little shell-like ears since the memory foam actually conforms to the shape of your ear canal, and it has the added benefit of sealing out most of the ambient noise. Now if JVC would only offer the replacement ear pieces in the same cute colors, it would be perfect..."
5,Great headphones!,"This is not going to be an overly helpful review, I just wanted to say that I love my pink marshmallows. They sound great and match my pink iPod Mini. I love that they block out the annoyingly loud music at the gym when I am trying to listen to my own tunes! Every earbud that I have every tried to use has hurt my ears (you know the little flaps of cartilage that are supposed to hold them in?)...because they are small or something, but these ones do not, no matter how long I have them in. My husband also just recently got himself a black pair because he liked mine so much."
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought these because I have small ear canals and all other earbuds either don't fit at all or hurt when I wear them. These are comfortable and I was impressed with the sound quality. My only complaint is that if you turn your head, jog, any movement really, the cord makes a thumping sound in the headphones that drowns out the music. If you're just sitting around listening to music or an audio book then they're great but anything active and that thumping will drive ya crazy! :( Still.. for [...] bucks.. not too bad at all."
1,Stopped working shortly after purchase,"First one earbud went out after about 3 weeks, then by 6 weeks they were both dead."
2,this is when techno started going downhill...,"The summer of 1992 couldn't last forever...and this type of techno was the result of it ending. After the techno scene became oversaturated, technoheads tried to make the music progress, and it quickly lost that unique sound as they edged towards harder, faster beats, and skimped on originality--and good riffs! speed hardcore techno just had no personality, and sounded like a bunch of noise. And that's pretty much what you get in this final volume of the x-static series. Perhaps they should have stopped at volume 6, before techno had lost it's appeal."
2,should've paid attention to the other reviews,The rose gold finish didn't even last a day. The stone is pretty. Maybe I should've gotten a plain silver setting.
4,cool colored earrings,"these earrings have such a vibrant wine color and can go with any other earrings i have on. only reason i give it four stars is that it really irritated my ears after a couple of days, so people with sensitive ears beware."
1,Ten and Amen killed AP name,"Astral Projection - djs who have pulled off the tunes no one in the world could repeat. Mind blowing album - 1999 Another World, then next to it - Dancing Galaxy. The sound so heavenly and so correct, it is amazing. However this cannot be said about anything that came out after the year 2000, hence ""Ten"" and ""Amen"". AP has decided to partner with incapable djs Fleming and other commercial barf-masters who could never even come close to the state of art goa trance AP was releasing prior to 2000. So my honest opinion , and the opinion of many goa djs with inclined taste in Goa is, 97 and 99 is perhaps the last we have seen of AP that is truly awesome and very much worth listening to. I still hope they recover from this rapid and harsh fall, but by looking at their track record in the new millennium things aren't in their favor."
3,"Good, but uninspired psychedelic trance","The opening of this album sounds promising, but it turns out to be fairly uninspired psychedelic trance in the style of early Juno Reactor or X-Dream all the way through. As I generally love that style of techno, I like the album, but find all tracks rather anonymous. Usually, with an album, at least one or two tracks stand out to a degree that I at least stop and think ""Hey, that's kind of cool"". Unfortunately, not so with this album.Based on the above, it sounds like this is really a terrible album, but its not so bad. Although I find it a bit bland, it's still nice overall. It's smooth and cool, and one reason why no track stands out may also be because it's so consistent. As a background track for whatever I'm doing, it works well.It's just not very original."
1,Amen and Ten in the wrong direction,"I have to agree with Yuriy Bouzelez's post that AP tanked with Amen and Ten. Amen and Ten are still good (perhaps 3 stars) in the psy trance genre as a whole, but for AP it is a decline, and that is why I am giving this one star. Amen and Ten pale in comparison to their earlier stuff. In fact, I learned of AP in 2005 after hearing UFOs, and then instantly bought all their CDs, not knowing which came first date-wise. Initially, I actually thought Amen and Ten were from their earlier years. Then I dug a little deeper and was shocked to learn Dancing Galaxy and Another World (which I would say constitute AP's peak and are 10 stars in the genre of pst trance) were actually earlier than Amen and Ten. I hope they can regain what they had before Amen and Ten."
3,Limited resources,"This book, printed in Hanoi, is the only English Language resource I have yet found. The paper, printing, and diagrams are very poor. It is however a resource for those interested in VN traditional medicine. I do volunteer work in small clinics in VN, all of which provide care by traditional doctors as well as allopathy. Each clinic has it's own herb garden, so this book was very helpful in learning the essential herbs of VN medicine."
4,Works fine,"This is not a ""mattress"" like your child's bed mattress, it has like foam and stuff in it I would guess. However, for a baby, it works just fine. Our 6 night vacation was a success."
4,Great for pack and play,"My daughter really enjoys sleeping in her pack and play, but the mattress is not very good to sleep in every day so I bought this mattress to put on top of the regular pack and play mattress. It doesn't fit perfectly, so sometimes her pacifiers fall in the crack between the net and the mattress but not a big deal at all. (this is why I gave it four stars instead of five.)The mattress is covered in plastic so whenever she vomits (she was sick a couple weeks ago) or whatever, its super easy to clean. I use the same sheets as I did with the pack and play mattress."
4,Great mini mattress for the price!,"I purchased this mattress for Baby Mod's mini rocking crib. It's a teeny bit short lengthwise but fits snugly and securely width-wise. My babe sleeps soundly so I guess it's comfy! I read other reviews prior to purchasing and I didn't run into the same construction defects as others. Also, the depth really is 3 inches so if you think it's thicker, it's not. Overall- great price, insanely fast shipping, and, most importantly, baby sleeps soundly all night. I'm happy and recommend this product!"
2,very poor quality,I purchased two of these mattresses and they both were ripped at the plastic seams exposing the foam inside the mattress. Not a good choice.
2,"L.A. Baby 3"" Compact Crib MAttress","This item was about 1 1/2"" too short for the PlaYard Crib. I tried to return it but I could not. I could not even return it to the store that it was delivered from."
3,Can't find sheets anywhere that fit that size mattress,"I like the fact that the mattress was here rather quickly, but when I compared the size to my child's crib I realized ""ooops, I got the wrong size"" but it turns out when I got my son a playpen it fit perfectly in there. (yes it's a little small - too small wish it were bigger but that's beside the point) i mean it hasn't ripped, it isn't bad quality that's not the point the only point is I try to get a sheet to stay on b/c my son likes to sleep in there, and by the time he wakes up I can't imagine how he could be comfortable with the sheets all bunched up like they get."
4,A great mattress for the pak'n play,We bought this mattress to put in my baby's Pak'n play that he uses as a crib for now.It's not too soft but it was better than leaving him on the hard board alone.I think my baby is sleeping better on it :)
2,bad mattress,they was wrong about the size. it was ultra small. I bought this thinking it would be good for using with a toddler bed but it was really small.
4,crib mattress,We bought this mattress for a smaller crib that we have at our Mother in Laws for when we visit. It is good for a portable crib but I don't think I would use for an everyday crib.
3,"It's actually 38"" long","I bought this because the listing said it is 24""x36"". When I received it, though, I found that it's actually 38"" long, which is too long for my crib, so I had to return it. Beware!"
3,Ok,"Mattress dimensions are 24""x 38"" not ""36"". Fit my Safety 1st Orion play yard very snug. Perfect fit in width but a little longer than play yard that it makes the mattress buck in the middle. The plastic covering is on both sides of mattress and even with a play yard sheet sounds noisy when baby moves. Its nice to add this to play yard to make it more comfy than the pad the play yard comes with."
3,How About the Season 8 Finale???,"The concept of having the ""best"" episodes on one DVD is a good idea, but I think that such a recap of this great series should have been delayed just long enough to include the two-part finale of Season 8 (not unlike the wrap up of ""The Fugitive"" from the '60s, which brings to a conclusion the protagonist's long and difficult search for the guilty one-armed murderer). So... how about an updated version of the ""Best of Monk"" which includes this dramatic and heartrending two-part climax?"
5,Monk's best,"I didn't see every single Monk episode, but theseare billed as the best one from each season. I wasn'tdisappointed. The famous medication-taking episode isincluded where he completely changes personality withno more crime solving ability. I would recommend thisDVD to Monk followers who want a taste of the best withoutspending too much money."
3,Okay for a Used Book,"The book looks okay for a used book. It came with a small amount of writing, highlighting, and a few bends."
2,Poor comfort,"I have a normal sized head, (7.0) and I think these things are REALLY uncomfortable. They do not sit on my ears well, hence the phones themselves are not well placed for good sound quality. I am sending these back."
2,Just okay.,"These headphones have pretty good sound, but as another reviewer mentioned, the fit was really bad. The hard plastic pressed into my temples, holding the actual HEADPHONES away from my ears. And I have a pretty large head, so I don't think that's the problem--I think they're just badly designed."
1,VHS,"when reading the information on this item, no where did it state that it was VHS...can't use it. Who uses VHS anymore? Threw it away."
5,Another good Jane Fonda tape,I have liked Jane Fonda's tapes since the first one. I can't do as much of her other tapes anymore (getting too old)so I thought I would try her Yoga tape. It is very good. Takes you nice and slow. Some other yoga tapes I have are just too difficult to do. They require more balance than I used to have. I can do this one and feel good when I am done. It has short segments to it so that you can just do it in a few minutes instead of feeling guilty if you don't finish a 40-60 minute tape.
4,Its not intimidating at all...:) Great for beginners.,i've just bought it but i already find it to be 'useful'. she's very gentle without being too lax. the perfect video for beginners. i hope to build flexibility and strength. wish me luck! p.s the relaxation section is GREAT!!
1,To slow and boring,"This video is very slow and repetitive, so I give this 1 point. I think to hold any attention for long it has to be better. At least for me this was a bad experience. Try real yoga of those who know how to teach it for beginners. Try ""Back Care Yoga for Beginners""...."
2,It is okay,It's a fair video as Jane tends to move the poses faster than I am used to. Okay for beginners.
2,so slow.......,"I do not have anything against Ms. Fonda but this tape, even with the use of sun salutations, is slow slow slow. If you like Power Yoga, by all means stay away from this one as it is slow and you will not enjoy it. If slow is what you are looking for, you may want to give this one a try but then again the basic Living Arts tapes are still much much better than this."
1,Only for beginners -- and not the best for that,"This video may be very good for someone who has never done yoga before but after working with yoga even a little while I found that this video didn't hold my interest. And I only used it a few times before shelving it for good. I didn't get the challenge or the feeling of serenity that I get from other tapes, especially the Living Arts tapes. If you're looking for a beginning video try Yoga Practice for Beginners."
3,India Ink is not for fountain pens!,"I did not understand that this ink is designed for pen sketching, or calligraphy! Therefore I incorrectly ordered it thinking it would be appropriate for my Waterman fountain pen. It does not FLOW through a nib, and therefore I goofed in selecting this product."
4,Good for the money.....,"I bought this unit a few months ago......With HD sat. service it looks great!! The one let down being that this model does not have HDMI input, but other that that Video games in 1080I look amazing.....great buy"
1,Overcooks on low,"I purchased this model with great expectations only to be disappointed. It boils and burns food on the low setting as well on high! There is no point in using the programmable timer. The outside becomes too hot to touch, a possible fire hazard. Called Rival to see if it is a recall item like other models they have. The answer is NO. Have to return it to store of purchase."
5,Product great...shipping horrible!,"We really enjoy being able to buy the refills because most stores stopped carrying them. The only problem that we had was that the box came and inside there was soap everwhere. All the bottles are covered. Most leaked and it was a mess to clean. Overall, the product is great, but something needs to be down about the shipping process."
3,how not to think,"This book is a faithful documentation of what it is like for a loving father, who happens to be an economist, raises his daughter. He talks about instilling a sense of justice in a child, while implanting his own biases in a new generation. The oversimplification of grand issues makes it easy to nit-pick his statements, but I find myself captivated by the progress of his thougths anyhow. Written in the tone of his much beloved lunch conversations, I feel like I have eaten lunch with Landsberg each day for a month. His has a wonderful writing style and I would recomend this book to any economist who either teaches or has children -- it will help translate ideas to the laity."
2,Overrated,I probably would have liked this book better had the author not adopted such a smug attitude of moral and intellectual superiority. I also feel sorry for his daughter if he truly interacts with her as he claims.
3,an unbalanced seesaw,"An interesting, thought-provoking book. In that he is trying to make the process of formation of economic thought easily accesible by all, it is a success. However, he too often oversimplifies, using circutous metaphors and radical leaps in logic to support his point. His extreme is as unworkable as any other. The world is inherently unfair. To attempt to change gov. on such a premise is like trying to balance two boxes perfectly evenly on a tilted seesaw. Like these boxes, Landsburg's argument has a tendency to fall."
4,Genealogy of the West and associated families,"I have read through this book. It is an extensive history of the West family with many stories, pictures, copies of documents, etc. I have found many of my own family here. This book was written many years ago, and I did find a few errors, but in my opinion, they were not terribly significant. This work was done many years before the Internet was available, so the material was gathered through many hours of research in court houses, libraries and through the mail. It is a well written work, and if you find some of your own family here, it will be well worth the effort to read it."
4,good winter home sweater,"It is quite a good and comfy home sweatshirt, great to put on when you come home from work, very comfortable and warm."
1,Poor quality,I have repeatedly bought Russell sweat shirts over the years and have always liked them. I will never buy another after seeing how poorly they are now made. There is no elastic in the waist band and the bottom of the sweat shirt will not stay up like it shows in the picture. Don't waste your time ordering this product!
1,less quality,I HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT RUSSELL SWEATSHIRTS FOR THE GOOD QUALITY AND FIT.THESE SHIRTS HAVE A VERY POOR NECKLINE AND WAISTLINE.POOR QUALITY!!!
3,sweat shirt,"The sweatshirts are not made like they use to be several years ago. The fit is off. They are short-waisted and are over oversized at the waist, as well. My husband has always worn this brand in an XL but these fit too large and short. The transaction with the vendor was fine."
2,Ain't what they used to be....,"Title (from an earlier review) says it all. Light, flimsy, see-through weight fabric is not what I expect from a Russell Athletic product."
2,Runs larger than size indicates,Nice sweatshirt but it had to be returned as the XL was more like a XXL or XXXL.
4,Beautiful Sleeper CD,"Don't let the obscurity of this CD fool you. This is classic Willie. Smooth, heartfelt, and supported by a cast of very talented musicians including Paul Buskirk on mandolin and Gary Weldon on harmonica and flugel horn.This CD contains some classics, like ""Stardust"" and ""Corina, Corina"", but its defining characteristic is that mellow, relaxing, beautiful ambiance of Willie's unpretentious sincere artistic expression. It contains a lot of what has made Willie a household word: simple, unadorned beauty combined with a style that makes him seem like someone you'd enjoy having as a friend.Great artists do not have to be distant gods on Olympus. Willie again proves that in spades here."
5,historical,if jou know a little about the deep knowledge of tai chi en p-h. then jou feel the diamont inside this book.a excelent book en meny credit for the writer en the translator olson.
3,A Good First Effort.,"While a mostly useful Osprey reference book, this volume shows its age in the fact that it covers too great a time period - over 40 years in the standard 64 page Elite format. Newer Osprey volumes tend to cover less than 10 years and have far greater detail packed into such slim books.This book is OK for now but hopefully Osprey will redo this subject in their newer, tighter focus format."
4,British Paratroopers,"It hard to find detailed information on the subject of the British paratroopers. This book gives you an introduction on the subject. It explaines how the units were raised. which operation they were involved in and what they are doing now. The absolute best thing about the book are the drawings from the author. In high detail they show the uniforms, the badges and weapons used by the British Paratroopers. All together the book gives you a nice prespective of the history of the British Airborne forces from the date of raising until now."
4,Organisze Your Office ..In No Time,"A Wise Investment. The most Organized person can learn from this book! Many of us can drive a car - but can we organize! Basic, easy to follow with examples, from your computer, to office desk to custom filing - great learning tool for all ages, occupations and careers. Should be taught in schools! Enjoy!"
3,useful,"Not the best holder, but it works with my mp3 player. Hoping to find a better one in the store though."
3,nice book but...,this is a nice little book. but i don't think the fairy faces are very pretty. it gives you good ideas for the poses. but you'll have to have some knowledge of how you like pretty fairy faces to look cause the artists depictions are not that pretty.you could draw inspiration in some of the scenes and poses though. also when you do the -search inside this books pages option- the pics they show are the best pictures in the book. theres probably a more visually stimulating fairy book out there but this book does give some good instruction and i do not regret purchasing it as a gift for my niece.
5,Classic,"I would call this book a classic for anyone wanting to draw fairies. It is a good place to start, gives good advice and practice and can get anyone going in the right direction."
2,Lacks modesty for younger children,"I was looking for a drawing guide for my daughter's 11th birthday and was hoping this book would be the key. We flipped through it at the craft store and it looked like a great instructional guide. The only hesitation I have and reason I did not purchase the book is the last few pages. There are some ill-clad fairies exposing more than I want my daughter to be drawing or her younger brothers to be seeing. I know it is common to have fairies naked even, so I was grateful there was only a few pages of what I would consider suggestive fairies. But, I wanted to share this review for other ""carefully modest"" parents who would rather not expose their children."
4,Not Quite,An excellent book--it will make you chuckle and will put your kids to sleep. But it doesn't quite measure up to the good old original Eloise book.
1,horrible,"the book was destroyed when I received it. Ripped pages, chocolate marks on multiple pages, and missing pages. I was very dissappointed!"
1,john deere american junk,"had problems crashing. followed all the suggestions on their website still does the exact same thing over and over and over. i have just thrown the cd in the garbage can and will never buy any bold software games ever. if your thinking about this game. don't. run away,run away. i gave it 1 star because the rating system does not go below that. again do not purchase this game. it will end up like mine, in the garbage"
1,Doesnt work,"I received the game and gave it as an early Christmas present. Good thing, because the game doesnt work. It should work on my computer, but none of the letters show up, so you cant read it and dont know what to do. Its a complete rip off!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,Thank you John Deere,"We had considered buying a farm. We know better now. Thank you John Deere for helping us avoid what would have been one of the biggest mistakes in our life. If your considering getting into agriculture, you really should play this simulation first..."
3,It's okay but I don't recommend it.,"Like others have said, the game does have a lot of bugs. My computer is new and high quality so I'm pretty sure it's the game and not my computer acting up. The game will freeze occassionally, other times i won't be able to preform some actions such as repairing the barn. And so it'll end up in such bad shape that my animals get loose. Sometimes my staff (when on auto) will leave to repair invisible items that I don't own, which wastes a lot of time. Prices to sell/buy animals will freeze, which, as you can imagine, makes making a profit on them very difficult. I have to restart the game every time something like this happens.Also the game moves kind of slowly, even when the speed is set to ""fast."" Watching animals mature or vegetables grow can get boring lol.I like the concept of the game though. If they create a 2nd version it may be worth buying."
3,I'M A FARMER. IT ISN'T ANY EASY LIFE.,"Farming can be pretty hard and most people think the opposite. This game doesn't demonstrate that. Most people think that farming is an easy life. As ""S.Kochel"" said in her review "" the average farm family makes a lot of money "" and "" teachers are low paid so I don't want my cousin to be that"". I disagree.You would likely have a better life teaching.There are also quite a few virises. Those could use some work. When I'm in the middle of the game it will shut down. There should also be more time in the year for the farmer to work. I think that you should be aloud to rent land if you couldn't afford to buy more land.I'm offended by the characters. Not one person should have to listen to them and there rude talking."
4,Lots of fun!,"There are quite a few things in this game that aren't exactly realistic. However, if they were to make everything realistic according to the real world of farming, it would make for a pretty complex game. Even though it is lacking some aspects, this game is a lot of fun to play, and can be pretty addicting.I would definitely recommend to purchase the Deluxe version. It includes many features left out of the regular version, such as putting cattle to pasture, purchasing horses, setting workers to auto-task certain buildings, and putting up hay. You can purchase these games from places like Walmart or Scholastic Book club for around $12. I couldn't find the Deluxe version on Amazon."
3,what a farm boy thinks,This game is a lot of fun to play. The things it lacks is that the farm season only last nine months instead of twelve so you dont get an actual account for the year. if you raise livestock lets say you have 100 cows how is it that only 5-10 of them have calves. the last thing is it does make the farm life seem like it is easy and farmers make a lot of money but what they dont realize is that farming isnt a 9-5 job its a 24- 7 job with lots of stress and problems. but enough of that the game is fun and im going to get the second version and recommend this one toany one looking for a game for the family
4,Not bad but could be better,"Not a bad game overall but compared to other sim games very much behind the power curve. I havent had many problems with it other than it just shut down once but I save often now. An auto save feature would be nice. Also, it would be nice to be able to assign the workers a specific task, such as milk cows and such. Another nice thing would be more animals as well as equipment offerings. I realize that it will be all john deere items but more of them would be cool. The graphics could be better but overall they are not bad. I hope that Bold does some more work and makes this the game it could really be."
1,Game is a disgrace and disappointment shame on John Deere,"As a farmer I am offended by this game, it made farmers look like bafoons with the dullard characters and the simpleton sounds they made.The game is very disappointing and did not live up to what it advertised on the cover. There were only two tractors to choose from and only three implements. You only had a choice of 4 crops. This paucity of choices was further frustrated by a game that simply did not work, the bugs are unbearable. Did anyone in development ever play the game?SHAME ON JOHN DEERE for endorsing this game. They insulted there buying market, if this is what John Deere thinks of its customers I will not buy anymore farming implements from them."
2,May not be for you. Be sure to be able to return,"I bought this for my wife who takes lots of pills at least 4 different times a day every day of the the week.I found an alternative, the Med Sun, that consists of separated independent boxes, each containing four sections which works for her. Each day is a separate container, so you can just take that day's medicines. It is very easy to open, load and close, as opposed to the Mediset, which is stiff and not very co0-0perative. She didn't like it and it sat up a shelf in laundry room till now when I can use it. If I go anywhere, I would have to take the entire box or decant that day's medicines."
1,not for beginners,"I bought the book first, because it used the conversational method, and thought it was great -- all it needed was the cassette tape to go with it. So I bought the tape, and it's a big disappointment. It has one fatal flaw: the spoken phrases and conversations begin at rapid-fire rate from the very beginning. There's no pause between sentences, no pause between speakers, no time to listen. There's no way a complete beginner can listen to something like this on a cassette player without constantly pausing, pausing, pausing, desperately trying to hear what these people are saying. It defeats the whole purpose of a language tape. I notice that the two reviewers who liked this tape both have previous Spanish language experience. If you don't know a word of Spanish, find something else."
4,Wise Little Tips for Smart Gardeners,"An easy book to read with helpful wise tips for smart gardeners who don't want to spend a lot of time working harder than necessary. It's a nice little reference book that to go back to for info from time to time. The tips are on a wide variety of topics: Master Plan, Time Saving Routines, Square Ft Gardening, Raised Beds, EZ Landscaping, EZ Flower Gardens, Herbs, Bldg the Soil, Composting, Soil Chemistry, Tools, Storage, Staking, Tomatoes, Vining Crop Supports/Polls/Trellises, Planting, Seeds, Transplants, Companion Planting, Pampering Peppers, Beating Weeds, Mulch, Pests, Harvesting, Food Storage, Frosts, Winter Protection (just to name a few)."
3,"Good, but short","I would have given this book 4 stars, but it is more of a short story and should have been published as such. Other than the length, I thought the book was very good overall. Great little story and even though I may have made other choices if I were in the main character's shoes, I respected and appreciated his actions anyway. The auther did a good job in swaying me to see things from the character's point of view. If you are trying to decide if it is worth reading, it is. Just don't pay full retail for it."
1,Not since L E Moddessit jr.,"God help me, but I cannot comprehend how someone can stand this author.It is now three novels I have attempted to care about by Silverberg, and I have failed utterly."
4,Cute dvd,"The cartoons are cute on this DVD, but buyer beware - if you enjoy mickey's clubhouse, some of the ones on this dvd are the same as other dvds."
2,standard commercial fare,"The main song is ""Te Daria Mi Vida"", which is a euro romp. Very energetic, very dancy. The rest of the album is very commercial pop a la Cristian or Enrique Iglesias. I like only a few tracks and the rest are just standard fare; for me if it not something rare than it is crap! But many will like this one."
4,Very complete and well documented.,"Great as a reference with good lay language. Not exactly something you'd take to the beach with you but with such a huge percentage of the population on psychotropics, pretty informative. Definitely worth buying whether you are a patient, a relative or friend of a patient, a non-psychiatric clinician, a mental health worker or, I daresay, even a psychiatrist!"
4,useful but outdated,The information is useful and common but quite outdated. The more updated information can be searched from the internet.
3,Not bad,One glaring omission is that he fails to mention that SSRIs can cause permanent sexual side effects even after discontinuance. Long overlooked by the medical community. Do google search for details.
1,By someone who knows Jack Gorman,Jack Gorman is slick. He is Glib. He is dishonest. So is his so called book. He has been in trouble for being a state employee and being on drug companies' payroll. It is only fitting that now he has lost his medical license. This guy was having sex with at least one if not many patient and then tried to commit suicide when it came to light. I will give him zero stars.
1,A very basic introduction,I purchased this book to help me do some analysis of human rights abuses (and also crimes) in Zimbabwe where I work. I was extremely disappointed by the book - I have no degree in geography or any field like criminal justice that might be related to this kind of work yet the contents of this book are so basic that anybody with a grain of sense could have worked it all out for themselves.The only useful idea I got from the book was that in doing any kind of temporal analysis of criminal activity one should be careful of aggregating data by month as different months 1) are different lengths and 2) have differing numbers of eg Sundays in them. Perhaps I should have worked that out by myself as well!!!Don't buy this book unless you are of below average intelligence or under the age of 17.
2,"No ""repeat play"" ??...lame","I have quite a few of the older Baby Einstein DVD's that my baby loves. I got all excited when I saw the commercial for this series with the Beatles song and the baby riding the dolphin. Well, that was pretty misleading. It's not bad per se, but it is just the same old footage of animals, puppets, etc. nothing new or innovative. Also, there is no ""repeat play"" feature anywhere on this DVD. Anyone who has these, knows its annoying to have baby happily watching only to get her all upset when it stops in 20 some minutes. Babies like repetition!! How do they not know that?? They can leave off every other viewing option because that is the only one I ever use. Also, its annoying that you can't buy just the DVD. Its a nice little racket Disney has going here. Way to nickel and dime for a sub par product."
5,Great video,"My 22 mo old LOVES Baby Einstein!! This isn't her favorite, but it's up there! We tend to spend the day singing, dancing, and banging on things after we watch this video. I love that. :) Get it!!"
5,Gift for nephew,"Bought this as a gift for my 2 year old nephew for Christmas and he loved it! He needs to be distracted in order to eat and this by far was an enjoyable distraction! Theres so much movement, it includes videos of animals, toys, and other babies"
2,Not much of a kit.,"The DVD is what you expect from Baby Einstein which if that's all you hope to get out of it, you'll be pleased. The board book is useless and contains pages of words that your baby could care less about. Where's the graphics? And I don't know how many babies really want to tune into a CD but maybe yours will. Overall we will get use out of the DVD, but that's it. Would have appreciated being able to buy these things separately and maybe save a couple bucks."
1,disappointed again,"I would not recommend this product. It does not capture the ""world of rhythm."" While the opening is quite nice, it follows the Baby Einstein formula of filmed toys. Money would be better spent on an actual instrument."
2,Not really that good the production is good,She is not the wackest rapper atleast she tries I hate her but atleast she tries well the production is as usuall is good but her rapping is some what premature like alwaysLyrics 2/10 Production 8/10 Overall 5/10
5,The Best of the Best,"The Polynesian Dance Directory by Karen Marks is full of helpful information, especially if you want to learn Polynesian dancing and have entertainers at your functions. I attended one of her Dance Workshops for the weekend and it was GREAT!!"
5,Excellent book for both enthusiasts and serious travellers,"It is a surprise to me that this wonderful book is out of print. Although somewhat dated (a new edition is sorely needed), this volume provides a wealth of information on air travel, airplanes, airlines and airports. It is extensively illustrated with informative drawings and photographs and makes for very enjoyable browsing for the enthusiast. It also functions well as a reference book for all air travellers and those connected with the air industry in any way. The subjects covered are too numerous to list in full, but include such areas as plane identification, airport operations, takeoff, inflight and landing descriptions, and airline insignia, to name just a few. The only possible criticism of this delightful book is that it lacks an index. I hope an updated edition is in the works!"
4,Lifted Up by the Cross,"Pastoral care is difficult, demanding, draining, and sometimes dangerous. Yet it also touches Christians one-on-one in a way that no therapy or counseling can match. Rather than exhaust oneself in programs that may not work or in legalistic snares, Eyer invites the pastor to live under the cross as a redeemed sinner, to point to the cross as the source of life and bringer of sense in a senseless and dead world, and to trust in the cross rather than leaning on human wisdom.Eyer knows the difference between a clergyman and a counselor and he keeps the reader/pastor from straying into unfamiliar territory where lawsuits may be the most minor risks.If you desire to be a Gospel-centered pastor and seelsorger, ~Pastoral Care Under the Cross~ belongs on your bookshelf and in your hands."
4,You can't look away!,"Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are not good role models. That is a given. They behave in a selfish and obnoxious way.But once you start watching their antics, it's almost impossible to look away. It's enthralling, watching them show up to ""work"" in insanely inappropriate outfits. Making a dog food sausage and giving it to someone they dislike. Letting their dogs poop in the field during a baseball game. Living in a trailer park!You just have to watch to see what's going to happen next, no matter how appalling it might be.There are also some sweet moments, where you might actually find yourself liking the girls, a least a little bit. This is especially true in the episode in which they make a 13-year-old girl over for her first date and keep a watchful eye on the awkward pair. They seem genuinely interested in helping the girl.Even if you sneer in digust at this spoiled pair, it's hard not to be entertained."
1,Poor entertainment,"Paris Hilton is not a bad person, she simply has nothing of value to add.This video set shows that.If you like Paris Hilton, you really must have a shallow and empty life. Not a simple one."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"I caught a few random episodes and remained vaguely disinterested, but I've grown to love the show on dvd. The point where I realised the show had more going for it than just rich girls being high maintenance was the part where Nicole's making fun of the baseball players' stretching, ""Can you guys do it at the same time ... and touch each other while you do it"", and then trying to convince the opposing team's coach to cheer for her team, all the while Paris is just standing around trying to look pretty. Maybe Paris would actually be cool if she wasn't doing the fake cutesy voice and persona all the time, who knows, but anyone who finds the world at large to be an oppressively formal place will find comfort in Nicole's irreverent vulgarity."
2,Damaged,I Love the simple life and ordered numbers 3 and 4 also. However in the second last episode of series 2 the CD skips and jumps and then just stops so that is a bit dissapointing. I was going to return it or exchange it but I didn't keep my receipt.Chelsea
1,"I'm rating the item, not The Simple Life","I Just recieved the second season dvd and just watched the first 5 episodes... but theres at least 9 episodes in season 2, not just 5. What the heck is going on...-There is only one disc (as it even says on this product description)???? Anyone else have this issue?"
4,Reality Check 2,"After sitting through all of season 1 I got this in the mail the very next day. It has several more episodes (3) than the first season, and it's general design and organization in the DVD is alot higher quality than the first DVD.My friends and I LOVE to sit around the tele and watch Paris and Nicole laugh their butts off. They are such a fun couple of girls, they spread laughter and joy around whenever we watch them.Season 2 is just as funny as the first, though it does seem a bit more ""scripted"" versus the first season. The story isn't as fun to follow up on, but you get to see so many different kinds of people that its well worth it. This Seasons lacks the strings that held it together so well in the first, but all is repaired in season 3.I love to watch this DVD and these young women make fools of themselves and everyone! Truly makes you wanna be a blonde! ;)*warning* after watching, you will being to say ""that's hott""... may become annoying."
2,"Needs too much work, not worth.","Bought this plane from Sears while it was on sale. I find this plane needs a lot of work to get it into a usable state.The shoe is not flat, after use about more than 10 pieces of 80/120 grit sand paper and many hours of time, it is still not flat, not even the area around the mouth.The blade needs good amount of work flatten to back and sharpened. but that could be normal at this price.Blade chatters, the frog needs to be flattened too.The sides are not true either.So tired to deal with this plane, really regret this purchase.Then I bought the WoodRiver V3 jack plane, which is much better a deal - it just works."
1,Don't recommend for complex machines,"I'm running XP SP3. I'm also running BOINC (a distributed computing app) and LCDC (which drives a front panel information display). GhostSurf broke both somehow - it may have been caused by GhostSurf's installation of .NET 1.1. Whatever it was, XP's System Restore failed to repair the situation, and my machine is running very slowly. I have no choice now but to reimage my whole hard drive from a (fortunately) recent backup.If you're running any unusual or complex apps on your machine, or depend upon the .NET framework for any apps, I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT YOU INSTALL THIS PRODUCT."
4,works great on xp pro with norton 2008,"I think it great these are the first bad reviews I have read and was surprised! the 2, HI reviews a day apartare the same guy with a chip on his shoulder.just go into Norton security's APP permission setting if there a problem. the only draw back is setting a lot of programs Internet setting to proxy setting. as for the spycatcher works very well! A+. you can get the spycatcher express for free. I had the trial was impressed and ordered it. if one of your forums will not let you log on just lower the settings for that site or permit cookies."
4,Great AP English Resource,"I scored a ""4"" on the AP English Literature exam and this book was the only prep-book that helped me out. A teacher of mine recommended it to me and by using it as a supplement to my class, I was exempt from taking English courses at college, so I think that spending the money on this book is much better than coughing up hundreds of dollars for a college course. It was worth it."
4,Living faith everyday is what this book is about.,"I started this book on a plane trip across country. It drew me in and I just could not put it down. I don't know what compelled me to buy it, but it is a wonderful memoir of one person's faith journey and the faith journey of people around her. It touches on the good, the bad, and the ugly of church institution, but left me with the conviction that Christian faith is hollow, if we don't truly practice what is taught by Christ, in everyday life."
2,not as good as Practicing Resurrection,"I readPracticing Resurrection: A Memoir of Work, Doubt, Discernment, and Moments of Graceshortly before I read this book, and I like _Practicing Resurrection_ much better.Neither has a strong narrative arc, but _Practicing Resurrection_ is full of beautiful heartbreaking moments, so the lack of a strong cohesive arc isn't felt as strongly, while _Things Seen and Unseen_ feels much more stumbling. There are still plenty of bits I like, but I am both much less engaged and much less moved. (It's also somewhat ironic reading stories of her being so un-pastoral, knowing that in her next book she will discuss discerning a vocation to the priesthood.)"
3,A Bit Disjointed,"While I appreciated the book as an Episcopalian who is very involved with my own parish, and one who is someone new to faith, I did find fault with her book. I felt it neeeded more structure.She tended to jump from person to person and from situtation to situation too quickly, leaving me with a long, dizzy list of people who mattered to her, but it seemed like I didn't really know too much about any of them. It would have have been better if she focused on a just a few people in the church and expanded more on her experiences with them. Still it is worth a read and an honest peak into what being involved in a church is all about."
1,I'm sorry I bought this book,"I will not even pass this book on to my friends to read. I would be embarrassed to say that I even read it. This book is so superficial that it is like gravy that is so thin, it slides off the meat of the meal and offers no sustenance at all. To tell you the truth, it is more like reading a blog than a book. From the other reviews, I thought that this book would be insightful and inspirational in an uplifting way, but it wasn't. It has everything to do with acting spiritual, but nothing to do with being a Christian. Just because you perform good works does not make you Christian, any one can do that. I longed to hear how Jesus Christ transformed the author and the characters surrounding her, but all I read was how they as a group transformed and supported one another. 2 Timothy 4:3"
5,Ice Maker...,Installation was a snap. Machine works as advertised. It was receivedearlier than predicted and ordering was a breeze. An exact replacementof the old unit as well as the valve.
5,We now have ice!!,"This kit fit our fridge perfectly and was making ice within an hour. I didn't need the extra ice holder since we had one from the old one but it was complete.I went behind the unit and replaced the filler tube, line, and solenoid valve so it is all new. I bled the water line so it would take less time to get water to the icemaker and within an hour I heard the familiar klunk of ice hitting the bottom of the tray. By morning, it had filled the tray full and stopped.What a bargain!"
3,Ok for hand tools and that's about it,"Like others have said, this does not come with mounting screws. Most people have them laying around, but if not, you'll be making an extra trip to Lowes and that's annoying. How much would it cost them to include 8 screws? The hanger hooks only extend out about 3 inches at most. This doesn't allow me to hang my weed eater, unless I affix a strap or rope to it first. I put my golf bag, full of clubs, on the last 2 hooks at the end of the hanging system and it caused the metal to bend. Even if it's not going to come out of the wall, it's still unsettling to see. Bottom line is for the price I think it is great for hanging shovels and rakes and things with straps on them, but wouldn't try anything with actual weight to it."
3,Cannot hold every tool.,Was only able to put light tools on this rack as the metal is very light weight. Was not as strong as I expected it to be but was still able to use it to the best of my ability.
4,"Simple, cheap, and efficient","These simple tool hangers, made from die cut sheet metal, are strong enough to hang heavy tools such as shovels (provided that the mounting screws are installed into studs), and install in a snap with the pre-drilled holes."
4,TH96 Wall Rack for garden tools,"This is the cheapest one I could find; After having used it for a month, I can say this unit is completely sturdy. I was contemplating buying the Holey Rail, but that was $40. For almost 1/4 the price, I got this thing, which works quite well.When you open it, don't be discouraged. The thing feels like a piece of foil. But it holds 6 garden tools of mine (including shovel, hoe, and a heavy weed trimmer).I dinged it one star because it doesn't contain the screws. Not a huge deal, but something like this should include screws."
5,classic cartoon,"The Littles was a great show because it was like being in a crazy world where everything is way bigger than you. Thats something that is lacking in alot of cartoons - imagination. This one had a lot and is a classic cartoon by now. And, oh yeah, this is real fun too because it is funny too and then I laughed, but then Jimmy threw a book at my head and then I cried and got mad then I hit him in the mouth too. But then we just made up friends again and then watched this again and it was still funny so much!!!!!!!!!"
3,"entertaining, but there's a problem","I used to watch The Littles as a kid, so I let my three year twins watch the video. They watched it many times often wanting it for both their daily videos. Then one called the other a dummy and when I told her that wasn't nice she changed it to stupid. I wondered where she heard that. Since The Littles was their most recent obsession I suspected it and paid more attention when they were watching. Granpa Little regularly calls Dinky ""Stupid"" ""Dummy,"" and even ""Fool."" I don't want my children to pick up these words and I hope to somehow edit them out."
4,A Nostalgia Rush,"I still remember reading ""The Flash"" on a hot summer day under the shade of the plum tree in my yard. This book gave me quite a nostalgia rush!! This is a quality production with archive quality paper and accurate vibrant colors. I gave this four stars instead of five because DC should have included the letters to the editor for each issue. Other than that missing element this is a fantastic book to enjoy the early issues of the silver age Flash."
4,Comfortable and they stay on,"The cable is nice and light (no stupid in-line volume control to weigh them down). They fit my ears great, and they sound OK for earbuds (a little muddy). The clips are a nice soft plastic that actually feels good over your ears. The buds themselves have foam on them. Foam inside your ears feels a bit scratchy, but not bad. I guess you could remove the foam if you don't like it."
4,Excellent for the price,I am very pleased with the overall quality and experience with these headphones. I was pleasantly surprised and recommend them.
4,Helpful How-To Guide,"I found this book to be well-written and very well-organized. I plan on using many of the structures and frameworks presented because they make good intuitive sense AND provide trainers with clues on what to look for to ensure trainings are working as planned. The ONLY disappointment with the book is that the lessons/examples/exercises it offers feel very old-school. My supervisors are younger, hipper and more sophisticated than the authors realize. I think their ideas, goals and structures make sense - I think they need to match those strengths with current, fun and relevant activites and lectures."
4,Reasonable Suspicion Training is very hard to find good info,"I was searching all over the net, and only found 2 reputable sources of DOT information on Reasonable Suspicion Training - one was this book here, and the other was by Dan Feerst - his DOT Reasonable Suspicion Training documentation on CD / DVD here @ [...] are all absolutely fabulous! I included a link to his DOT reasonable suspicion training info because it's the best on I saw!"
2,Not as good as the vinyl 33,"Like many classics reissued on CD, you can hear the difference between LP and CD - or rather, you do NOT hear much of the richness and depth of the LP. In addition, some of the tracks in the beginning play a fraction faster than the original LP. I keep trying these reissued CDs, but not many of them are worth the money."
4,Old Spanky Classics,"I was always a fan of this group since I grew up during this era. Even though they weren't around very long as a group, they left us with several classic songs that still sound good today. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I think the old recordings as they are presented on this CD don't come out as clear on my sound system as I would have liked. Maybe I'm just used to listening to remastered recordings and in this case nothing more could have been done to improve the clarity of the sound. It's still a great CD for any ""Spanky"" fan to have in their collection."
1,Disappointing - Don't Buy,"This CD lacks many of the well known songs that Spanky was known for. Four or five of the songs included were not even recognized and the so called ""remastering"" was not any better than the originals that are available on older CDs.Do not get this album unless you need to add some of the unknown tracks to your collection."
4,Spanky & our Gang - best of:,"I like the cd! I remember 3 of the songs on the album (Sunday will never be the Same, Lazy Day, Like to get to know You). ""Sunday will never be the Same"" is a fantastic song! what a beautiful melody! ""Lazy Day"" is almost as good.hearing them brings back memories of my childhood.ah, wonderful!"
5,Great Gift,"Gift for my husband...he is reading it now. I have already read the book years ago. He showed interest in the subject, so i ordered it for him for Christmas."
4,Some very interesting points,"The beginning of this book is interesting but somewhat repititious. Granted, the author is quoting from different sources but it became rather slow to plod through. It became much more interesting about 35 pages or so into the book and was very worth reading. I would definitely recommend it and am giving 3 as gifts."
5,The Barchester Chronicles DVD,"The Barchester ChroniclesI love BBC movies and watch them often. Barchester Chronicles is quite good. Might be a bit slow moving for some. Alan Rickman is at his haughtiest, 19th century church politics play important role in this one, as well as a period romance."
3,Don't expect production quality seen in recent BBC drama,"I purchased The Barchester Chronicles as part of The Anthony Trollop Collection. I almost wish I had seen this movie before owning nearly every other BBC mini series produced over the past 10-15 years. It felt like I was watching a home video. The transitions between scenes were extremely awkward and it lacked a soundtrack of any kind. I love BBC drama and wish I could enjoy this movie more since the acting and costumes are superb. It was released in 1982 so I understand that the budget and film capabilities have changed greatly since then, but it is very difficult to watch if you are used to more recent BBC productions such as Daniel Deronda, Wives and Daughters, etc. I do appreciate the adaptation although not one of my favorites with regards to production."
3,Not as engaging as I'd hoped,"The story is good, but the pace is slow. Alan Rickman's performance is up to his usual excellence, but some of the others are a bit disappointing. It was something worth watching once, but not a ""keeper"", in my opinion."
2,Mr. Harding's plight,"I thought that the point of this movie was a little obscured. I guess it was not entirely a waste of time, but I did not see a huge amount of value in the movie. Still, it was interesting."
1,The Barchester Chronicles,I was only recently able to view this movie and so it had remained un-opened since I received it. I was thoroughly enjoying it but the latter part of the first DVD would not play properly and there was no second disc. Very disappointing.
1,Think twice before buying,"Don't buy this set unless you can't or won't spend more than its price, want these pots for some purpose other than cooking, or don't mind that they may not last. The tiny near-useless handles and one good-sized one appear only lightly tacked on. The metal, although stainless, is thin and quickly develops pits inside where it appears the finish has worn off. These pots heat up with woklike speed, burn delicate ingredients, and give you a chance to live the old joke about making a meal just like mother used to make it. You'd have to spend about twice this price on the web or on sale to get pots you wouldn't regret buying."
1,Caveat Emptor,I have 4 of these....If you want a small kind of noisy fan in the room with you buy it. It does a mediocre at best job of removing pet odor or cigar smoke. I'd buy a larger air cleaner. Please dont repeat my mistake.You get what you pay for. The unit plugs into the wall and operates with the same noise as any 4 inch fan. It doesnt pull enough air through the filter to be effective.I have a big kenmore that really works well. Its all about moving air through the filter; this one just doesnt seem to pull much through.Thanks and good luck
4,This one IS better than the movie,"Dennis Etchison, once again writing under the pseudonym of ""Jack Martin"", does a fine job novelizing the illogical but fun, Michael Myerless Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Unlike his more pedestrian work on the Halloween II novelization, Etchison, as he did with The Fog, expands upon the narrative, digs deeper in the main character's personal problems (his drinking and failed marriage) and attempts to fix some of the film's countless story problems (i.e. with time zones, conspiracy etc). He piles on the creepy, shadow drenched atmosphere as well. The novelization also contains a few in-joke references to The Fog as well as the unrelated Halloween films. Carpenter and Etchison fans will find plenty to like in this overlooked oddity. Recommended."
4,Good novelization,"If you think this is an above average novelization,the fact that ""Jack Martin"" is actually horror writer Dennis Etchison has a lot to do with it. Etchison even adds a few scenes either never in the film or that were cut out. Great movie,great book!"
4,The Taylor Boys,"Livingston Taylor has a PHD and teaches music in an Eastern College. When he is not doing that he is writing music, recording, and does some concerts (both for private companies and open concerts) and doing very well. He just came out with a new CD and it is excellent as well. Livingston is James Taylor's brother and they sound a lot alike...they look alike....and you can tell they are family. Good music if you like the James Taylor style...no doubt. I really enjoy Livingston and hope to see a concert some day. He also has a DVD on how to play the guitar if you are interested. Enjoy the music....it is worth the buy."
4,An Excellent Easy Reader -- Funny and Exciting,"I believe that Edward Marshall was a pen name that James Marshall used for many of his early books. I don't know why, or why he dropped it later on.This funny story should definitely be returned to print. It's a bit wordier than some of Marshall's later books, and it doesn't have any sequels, but it is charming, amusing, and memorable. It's also a good early-reader that features a quick-thinking little-girl heroine. A great book for all kids, and especially for girls."
2,Introduction to Java Programming with JBuilder 3,"If you know some Java, and you want a third party description of JBuilder -- Watch out, JBuilder 3.5 is what Borland ships today and this book is full of assumptions about JBuilder 3.0. Few of the dialogs match, which makes the early tutorials almost useless. The book was published in February 2000 and I bought it in May, and it is already outdated. I couldn't recommend this book."
1,Obtuse++,"I suppose if you've had extensive experience with OOP and C++ you'll be able to deal with this book. Otherwise, you're in deep trouble. The book introduces terms and topics long before they're adequately explained, blows through complicated topics without much illustration, and insists on using example programs that are obtuse. I spent more time trying to understand the example programs than learning the construct the program supposedly demonstrated. This was the assigned textbook for a class on Java I was taking, and after 5 chapters, I gave up on it. After searching amazon, I found the truly excellent book by Walter Savitch, Java: An Introduction to Computer Science and Programming. I've completed all my assignments using the Savitch book."
5,As good as it gets,"I saw these guys opening for Ben Kweller at the Fillmoore in San Fran, thought they were pretty good, and dished out a couple bucks to buy their EP. Now, six months later, I have actually listened to it, and realized how truly amazing it is. They have good vocals, good instrumental, catchy tunes, and it isnt like all the other trash thats coming out these days, pretty damn good live too.....I met the bassist...."
2,Ernie Ball,"Heads up! Comes with ""warnings"" that make you not want to use.Went ahead anyways. Had eye protection on while using polish...eye are not right at the moment. Smell is not pleasant...looked and looked for directions.(site and on product..NOTHING!)Cloth seems nice on guitar. Sorry Ernie...not pleased."
1,a waste of time,"these are not luxurious oceanfront homes. they are ALL uglyplain homes that give no decorating ideas (maybe to my grandma)if you are looking for spectacular,check out Florida Design magazine."
4,I Cried Buckets,"This story was moving and inspiring, keep tissues handy at all times. I liked that the book provided an unusual opportunity to experience the thought processes and emotions that accompany a sudden and imminent death sentence. I greatly admire the author for his ability to remain so focused, driven, thoughful, and clear headed despite his tragic situation. Mr. O'Kelly's story taught me alot about life and death, and how to manage both in a meaningful and productive manner."
3,Planning your end of life,"When i read the intro to this book, i assumed it was going to be a tear-jerker for sure and very illuminating. Well the latter was mostly true, the former wasnt it. No tears at the end. I think Gene's intentions were true, but his method of achieving them, may have been too organizational...like his life.One has to be impressed (amazed really) with his determination to do this regardless if it was an essay on his career rather than reflections of life in general.Most people these days write books to make money, gain fame on things not worthy of knowing. I think in this case, Mr O'Kelley helped us understand something about death..of which we all are facing someday."
5,Live your life,"After living his life for his future, Gene O'Kelly went to the doctor one day to find out after never being sick that he had less than five months to live. That was it, nothing could be done to save him. Cancer. No pain, no warning, nothing. The only thing I can say to anyone, including myself after reading this book, is to live your life for today, this moment, right now. Don't live in the past, and do not live for the future. The past is gone, and the future might never come.To write a book as eloquent as this during his last four months of life could not have been easy, but Mr. O'Kelly left everyone who reads this a tremendous lesson on what is important in life. Slow down. Enjoy what is important and treausre your family. Balance between work and family life is vital."
5,Too late to enjoy life!,"This is a very powerful book. It is an inspirational one. It puts everything in perspective. In the last three months of his life, he realized what is important. However, it was too late!"
5,Extraordinary...,"I was so overtaken by the story of Gene and his ""ordeal"" of dying. Not many would be able to take the next step of the ending journey and actually preapare themselves for the next journey, if one believes in that. He shows us step by step as he is trying to close the chapters he once opened in his life. He wants to bring some sense into what's happening. This is his ending and he wants in on his terms, as he faced the reality and accepted it, but yet he wishes to make this an easy experience on those that he must leave behind. I love the courage that he had to do that. An interest in making everything perfect. The story is finished after his death, by his wife. I can actually say that I feel the sorrow and sadness in my heart for those he left behind and wish them all the best......."
5,How to have a good death,"The CEO of a Fortune 500 company learns he has inoperable brain cancer and sets out to make the very best use of his remaining weeks. With the same energy and vigor he ran his company, he now learns how to let go and value the moments which remain to him.Well written. Inspiring. Not saccharine sweet."
3,Perhaps too much of a business approach to a life event,"Well, first of all, I enjoyed the book. I have all the respect in the world for anyone who is put in the situation that Gene O'Kelly finds himself in and has the time and the desire to write about it. My thoughts to his family. I just find his approach to his imminent death too business like. Death is the great equalizer and at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter how many customers bought whatever it was you were selling or that you were working 100 hours a week, (unless out of necessity), what matters most is what you did with the hours you were given. Mr. O'Kelly even comments about the very few times he had lunch with his wife during the week, or attended a play or recital that his daughter was in. What would you do if you knew your life would end in 5 months? Something to think about."
2,An interesting journey....but missing something,It always seems that when people come face to face with their own mortality they want to reflect. The problem I had with the book was it seemed more like a self-published obituary than a look at life. It seems like the time writing the book would have been better served on the ones he loved and not on a public forum.
2,Too obvious,"This book proposes to provide some great insight into death, thereby giving some understanding about how to live. While written by a man of obvious talents under the worst of circumstances, one finds litte of interest. Mr. O'Kelly's advice can be boiled down to the obtuse admonition ""live purposefully."" Indeed, the entire book is cliched. Enjoy each moment. Make every day the best. Tell everyone that you love them.Joan Didion's ""The Year of Magical Thinking"" is a much better read on the losing, leaving and letting go which hallmarks both our life and our death."
3,Inspirational,I found this book to be inspirational. I also found it to be painful to read. The author faces his own iminent death and does so with great dignity. There are great lessons to be learned but it is nonetheless a difficult topic and a difficult read.
1,MISLEADING,"This book promised from the exerpts to be an interesting book about a man's awakening, but it turned out to be a christian book which was more preaching than journeying. A real dissapointment."
3,Chasing Daylight,"Interesting, but not too much.I can't understand how he managed to write a book if he had a brain cancer."
4,Touching Memior,"I am half way through this book and could not put it down! I thought it would be more about the man and how he rose to the top of his field but it's instead a book about facing terminal illness and dying.The author was so brave and his thoughts are captured very well.It's a very sad book though because this man was at the top of his field, loved his life -- appeared to have it all -- and then is diagnosed with terminal brain cancer for which there is no cure. Really sad.It's a reflective read and the message is live in the moment because that's all we really have. I will remember this more as a sad account of someone bravely facing their own death. Reminded me of my father who at age 57 was diagnosed with terminal cancer and died five months later.Overall, good book and inspiring man but the story is too sad for me. I guess I want to live in the moment too and not think on death too much before I have to!"
1,chasing daylight,"I was hoping this would be one of those ""all inspiring books""> It turned out to be depressing. It made me realize life is indeed to short ! We all are going to die sooner then later !"
2,Not believable,"My general impression of this book is that it is not believable because it seemed to me to be written from the perspective of a man who is ALREADY DEAD, as if he were the omniscient narrator of his own story, writing about his death from beyond the grave, from a place he has carefully crafted in his imagination; perhaps the heaven he hoped awaited him.However, I'm a believer in the importance of saying goodbye and I found the sections where O'Kelly wrote about his internal experiences to be the most interesting, useful, and profound. Like others, I wondered why he wasn't taking that trip to Prague with his wife and young daughter!There were also a few instances of my thinking that the effects of his illness had to be too debilitating for him to actually BE the author, but I was never interested enough in combing through the text for hints, constructing a timeline, etc."
3,Accountants Take Notice,"As a KPMG alumnus who tends to work way too many hours, this book serves as a wakeup call to all of us as we struggle to balance family and career. The author spent many of his limited last days writing a manuscript. Ironic but thought provoking."
3,Tragic story but short on learnings ...,"Not what I had hoped for or even expected. I feel for his family, especially his 14 year old daughter, who he only talked about a relationship to the end. It is well documented and I believe authentic and sad to me. Even when facing death he had to be the CEO telling people what they should feel and deciding on his 'three' eulogies and who should give them and in one case even writing part of it. Sad for his family who he admits he was always traveling for his beloved company. If there is a message in here it is that he may be the first guy to say 'if I just had one more day at the office.' The entire book to me is centered on the fact that he talked of his love for his daughter all the while saying his good byes for three weeks to business associates and in the end never took the trip he promised her before he died. I guess there are some learnings but not what he intended to write. Disappointed for sure."
3,Chasing Daylight,This is one of the most profound and inspirational books I have ever read. I came away feeling that this was a very positive book in that it helped to remind me what is really important in this earthly journey; which is something we all lose sight of from time to time. An incredible story of hope and victory!
2,"A Good Start, but....","This book had an amazing amount of potential, but was less than satisfying in the end. The history, while very interesting, was disjointed and unorganized. The layout could also have used some reworking. Descriptions of art works, outfits or accessories would appear several pages after the photos themselves. I got the impression that some photos never made it to the final book, although the text still made reference to them.This book is also frustrating for the historical costumer. Ms. Yang often used the phrase, ""This style was popular during the Shilla period."" Unfortunately, the Shilla period spanned almost 1000 years! Some more definitive dates would have been highly useful.Ms. Yang's book is a nice introduction for the style and overall look of the hanbok. Hopefully Ms. Yang or someone who shares her passion will publish a more scholarly work geared for historians and costumers."
2,Low Quality Reproduction,"This reproduction of the English Hexapla has all the appearance of having been made by someone in a public library with a roll of quarters in their pocket and a line of impatient patrons waiting for this individual to hurry up and finish using the photocopier. As the previous reviewer mentioned the type is very small - in fact I would need a magnifier. There is a black smear running through the center of the pages where adjacent pages of the original photocopied Hexapla come together. The editors of this edition didn't even bother to remove these ugly stains with some ""white-out"". Some of the pages were photocopied straight and others came out crooked ... On top of that the binding is generic. The publishers glue a paper strip along the spine with typed words reading ""The English Hexapla ..."" ..."
4,"Ditto -- Speakers awesome, but Sub is lacking","These speakers are great! I'm running them on a Pioneer Elite 81TXV. The speakers are absolutely amazing, as is the receiver. Now I just need to pick up two more satelites for full 7.1 surround.As mentioned in previous reviews the sub is lacking. I have the sub connected via the LFE input from the preout on the receiver. The recommended set up in the directios was too confusing and required too much speaker wire.I intend to replace the sub at some point in the future.I hope that my short review helps!"
2,Main character a big whiner.,"I tried reading Dante's Inferno but I hate reading poetry and old stuff, so I decided to give this guy a chance. While i'm grateful for having the details of Dante's Inferno brought to life, I did not appreciate the whiny main character complaining about everything and asking a million questions. A better alternative than this book is Edward Lee's Lucifer's Lottery, Infernal Angel, and the other one wrote by him. Those books I have read twice, that should tell you how fascinating they are."
3,Not as good as other novells by these two,"As one of my favorit (living) authers Niven which often has a great idea in each novell, takes again a somewhat new twist to an old consept.But this book is just bearly OK to read.Luky that its page count is small (if you compare it to todays sagas in fantasy novell series...)."
4,This book helped me write my book about Hell!,"I read this book somewhere in the 80's. I was a devout fan of Dante's Inferno, and when I discovered this book set in the author's version of Dante's Inferno, I immediately latched on. Since then I have gone on to write my own books, The AngelFall Series, also available here on Amazon.com. Although I created a completely different version than the authors, they were somewhat inspirational and allowed my foray into Hell.Hopefully, I will also excite readers. My thanks to Pournelle and Niven!AngelFall Book I - A Novel of Hell (The AngelFall Series)AngelFall Book II - A Novel of Hell (The AngelFall Series)Also available in paperback!"
5,Surprised,"This book surprised me. I expected a farcical romp through Dante's Inferno, and instead got an insightful read on the lies we tell ourselves about the evil we do. It was a compelling and worthwhile story that kept my attention all the way through. In the notes at the end the authors comment that they intended in this book to bring together Dante's geography of hell and C.S. Lewis' theology (as found in The Great Divorce). In my opinion, they pulled it off well. And then some."
5,Hellishly Fabulous,"My copy of this excellent work is tattered and duck-taped together, but I still loan it out to many eager readers. Niven and Pournelle are a great team, and have not let me down with this horribly wonderful novel about a science fiction writer who falls from a high window and finds himself confronted with waking up dead. In Hell. Loosley based around Dantes classic, The Divine Comedy, this book oozes competence and sharp wit from the very start and doesnt let you go till the last page is read. I wish it was still in print. If you see it, grab it...It's a dandy.---C. Smay END"
4,Retelling of Dante's Inferno updated & modernized,"This is an absorbing retelling of the Inferno with the main character not a tourist but a deceased SF writer, Carpentier, who is hoping that there is indeed a way out of Hell.Carpentier is soon persuaded that there is no way out going up and starts on a journey through the circles down and in, meeting assorted modern American sinners on the way down. His travelling companion, an Italian, points out that he tended to notice sinners of his own kind and so does Carpentier.The ending is thought-provoking and I found the book worth rereading. Recommended."
3,Disappointed,"After reading a previous book; Lucifer's Hammer by the same authors, which I enjoyed, I was extremely disappointed in this book. If I hadn't paid so much for the book, I would have stopped reading it. For the most part, I found it dull and boring with the last 1/3 mildly interesting as Allen Carpentier walked through hell. Of course this is my opinion that is not shared with the other reviewers. But, since I depend on reviews, I felt I had to add my own opinion!"
5,Inferno is a must read for any Niven/Pournelle fan.,"Inferno is a master work by two of today's leading science fiction authors. The story is straight forward, the characters are well defined, the theology is consistant and the format is quick. Niven and Pournelle describe the impossible in terms that make you believe in the fantasy universe they are creating. The word pictures are so graphic that you can actually visualize the levels of hell."
4,It really is a cakewalk through Hell,"If the Divine Comedy had actually been funny, it probably would have been something closer to this tribute, Inferno. As it is, the cast of characters Niven and Pournelle assembled, real and fictional, are as nuanced and complex as a reader could ask for and the point of the story is subtle if inescapable. A book for both SF and non-SF readers, Inferno transcends its genre"
5,"One of my favorite ""SF"" books ever","I long ago lost my original copy of this book (loaned it to my former Latin/classics teacher). The original was just by Niven, if I remember.This is a great book on it's own, and even better if you've read Dante's Inferno. Because the main character is a part of the action, and not just a passive observer like in the original Inferno, it makes a more personal tale, and adds dramatic tension, while the original was much more of a pure contrivance for exposing the sins and hypocrisy of various groups of Dante's time.Lots of groups get (rightly or at time wrongly, depending on your views) skewered along the way. I can't comment on the updates yet, but I'm going to try hard to find the time to read the re-issue (and sequel). Hopefully, it will focus on the Inferno again, since in Dante's trilogy, Inferno was by far the most interesting - which is no surprise."
4,"Fast read, bit of humor too","I enjoyed this book - found it a fast read, some funny exchanges between the characters. There were some gory descriptions, but this is about Hell afterall. I will probably go ahead and read the sequel as well."
5,I saw satan laughing in the night!,Whenever Niven and Pournell team up you know it's gonna be good! And this one doesn't disappoint. By far one of my favorite books of all time. This modernized version of Dante's classic is a literal walk through hell and back. A must for your bookshelf.
5,Inferno - one of Niven's best,"It has always seemed rather strange to me that when people mention Niven, it is almost always in connection with his Known Space books or the Smoke Ring. The ""Inferno"" is kind of forgotten, although it is one of his best books. [this comment applies to the original version of ""Inferno""; I haven't read this revised edition yet]"
4,A New Twist on a Classic Piece,"The authors have cleverly reconstructed, and constructed the rings of Hell in this latter-day retelling of Dante's Inferno. I think anyone familiar with it (Dante's) will appreciate how the story re-envisions and springboards off into some new directions in this tale.For those of you who may devour Niven & Pournelle's book and seek to read the follow-up to it, beware: its writing and inspiration falls short of what you will find in Inferno.For fun, read the English translation of Dante's original Inferno.Dante's Inferno (The Divine Comedy, Volume 1, Hell)"
1,$10 for 35-year old paperback?,"This book, like nearly everything Larry Niven touches, is gold. However, the book was written in 1976; I read it when I was 10. They want $10 for a book you can get at any yard sale for 50 cents. Not on my watch."
5,A wonderful book,"I read this book many years ago, and have been looking for another copy of it for years. I would love to read it again now that I am older. I sincerely hope it is republished. A movie about it would be really nice, then they would have to reprint the book."
4,Serialization,I read this back when it was originally published as a serialization in a Sci Fi mag. I enjoyed it and I am looking forward to the sequel which I understand is in process. I was intrigued enough to find a copy of Dante's inferno to compare.
5,Someone could make some money by getting this re-released,I first read this great book back in the 70s and have been looking for another copy of it every since. It is a fantasic book and I have recommended it to numerous friends without knowing it was out of print.
5,The finest I have ever seen,"It is heavy! Have a couple of friends with you to help move the box containing the top. I also purchased the cabinet that mounts under the bench. This is assembled first, it is quick and easy and it turned out absolutely square. The trestle is next. The cabinet is enclosed in the trestle as it is assembled. The top is HEAVY, did I mention that? Have a couple of friends help you with it.What I found very satisfying was that every piece fit perfectly, every dowel, every pre-drilled hole every screw, nut and bolt was a perfect fit. The box contains a small continer of glue for the knobs on the vice handles and a container of oil for touch up I guess, the entire bench and cabinet was very well finished and oiled. When the vices are closed the jaws meet perfectly. If you are looking for a HEAVY workbench to last you the rest of your life and then pass on to your son this is the one. You won't regret it for a minute."
5,"Compelling, captivating, spellbinding -- and true!","This is (IMHO) one of the finest books ever written about arctic exploration (and I've read dozens). Berton is a superb writer, an unmatched storyteller, and a gifted chronicler of much-too-neglected aspect of recent history. The men and women of arctic exploration come alive under the author's perceptive pen, and before you know it you caught up in the world of Parry, Ross, Franklin, Back, Simpson, Amundsen, Cook, Peary, and host of lesser-known but intriguing characters. If you have a heart for history and the people that influenced it, you won't be able to put this book down! An added bonus is the respect with which the author treats the arctic native peoples, without whose help and support every kabloona (white man) who ever set foot into the arctic would have died tragically. I've read this book three times, and am looking forward to my fourth journey into the world of ""The Arctic Grail."""
5,Moose,"Mr. Marble likes having a moose for a friend. Sam, the moose, is always happy & cheerful. He likes to jog & ride his bike. Most of all, Sam loves to sing.Sam sings at the top of his big moose lungs. The only problem is that when Sam sings, dogs howl, windows break, people can't sleep, and neighbors complain.But Sam has a good heart. Once he understands the problem, he gets to work on a solution that will make everyone smile.This book has 3 fun filled adventures: Mr. Marble's Moose makes a Joyful Noise, The Moose is Loose, & The Moose & the Worm.Written in a simple, inaginative style & sparked with bright, funny illustrations, Sam the Moose's adventures are fun for beginning readers or perfect for ""read aloud."""
4,"Great, versitile lens","I was a bit concerned at first with the fixed focal length, but it has proven to be very versatile. It takes very sharp pictures, even when fully opened in low light. I have not noticed any of the vignetting that other users have mentioned.Bottom line: great wide angle lens for the price. Useful for landscapes and tight space, low light situations."
2,Not recommended,"The lens is okay on a 1.6 crop factor digital camera, but it isn't particularly wide-angle then (32mm field of view). I hear that it is okay on a film camera, but I have no experience. On a full-frame digital camera, it stinks....Digital cameras can be affected by the angle a lens causes light to hit the sensor, and it seems to make a difference here. The lens produces smudged, blurry images on my full-frame camera. It is okay on my Rebel XTi, but not wide enough to be impressive. It stinks on my 1Ds.Build quality is okay, but nothing special. If you buy this despite my recommendation, spend a bit of money to get the lens hood (which doesn't come with the lens). It will help keep glare off the front element.If you can afford it, buy one of the wide-angle L zooms instead of this lens. If you can't afford those, get a Sigma zoom (preferably the 12-24, but alternately the 15-30) instead of this lens."
2,Overpriced and underperformed,"I wanted a 20mm prime to use for night shooting, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I chose poorly. Returned it the same day. Still on the hunt for a good prime night long exposure performer.This lens was really soft around the edges (even on my 40D with a 1.6x FOVCF). Although I don't need a fast focusing lens for night use, this lens still focused slowly during its day use.It's grossly overpriced. Should be only $299 at most."
4,Lens,"Always happy with Canon Lenses.. I am more a detailed photographer, I purchased this mainly for my husband. He enjoys taking more landscape photography. Overall, very happy!"
4,Excellent lens,"I hella enjoy using this lens, its always hooked on my Canon 40d. One of Canons cheap wide lens. Excellent made, perfect."
3,Techno,"Direct Drive Vol. 2: Techno is pretty good. The songs vary from track to track, because of some interesting experimentation. Overall, I'd say that I've heard better stuff, but Direct Drive is right up there. Check it out for yourself!"
3,Hmmmmmmmmmm,"I've only used it once and found that it was a waste of money. Don't get me wrong...it is cooling and made my feet feel OK, but it's no different from the other peppermint foot lotions and sprays that I have. Just go on over to The Body Shop or Bath and Body Works and pick up something there."
5,Cool!,"Ive been using this spray for about 2 years. I keep it in my car actually and I will spray my feet after working all day (take off my socks and spray my feet) its a great way to calm the stress in your feet and refresh them on the way home. I also use it before and after yoga (practice bare foot) and its amazing.My mom saw it in my car and sprayed it and was amazed at how great it makes your feet smell and feel. When wearing sandals I just spray it right on my feet, you dont even have to take your sandals off.Plus, its anti-germ properties (the tea tree oil) reduce germs on your feet that cause odor and things like fungus.You have to try it!Ive seen it at my local grocery store, target, walmart and even ulta! its pretty easy to get some locally."
3,Briefly helps,"The spay has a nice minty smell, but it lasted only a few hours. Basically, it masked unpleasant smell but does not do anything to treat the cause of the smell. I purchased some medicated powder from CVS instead (great results) and use this spray for my shoes in storage."
5,Even works on stinky teen feet,"I have been using this faithfully for years ... I loved the companion foot wash, but they don't make it anymore ...I have hyperhidrosis (sweaty feet) and this keeps my feet feeling cooler, and never smell ... even with manmade shoes."
3,Spray nozzle inconsistent but product refreshing,Unfortunately the spray nozzle doesn't work consistently.Folks when you are spraying your tired feet with this product after a toughday at work & the product doesn't spray well it's a little frustrating. The productdoes contain organic ingredients including tea tree oil & it is somewhat refreshing.
5,TRULY PROFOUND BOOK,"I reviewed this book two years ago. What I found moving about this book were the laws enacted to prevent African Americans from moving forward and in contrast, the achievements reflected in the book from science to art to technology to inventions in spite of the laws. The book showed the true spirit of African American people."
5,OEM Replacement Part,Bought this to replace the inverter cooling fan in my 1997 Prevost. Worked as advertised and the price was reasonable.
5,This book has saved me many pointless hours,"I used to wander aimlessly through the aisles of my video store without much of a clue as to what to rent for quality and nudity. Now I keep Mr. Skin's Skincyclopedia in my car for quick reference before i brave the video store shelves. Now I even know where to find Julie Andrews naked. My childhood memories of Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music are forever altered. And as I work my way through the rest of the book, I continue to come across many other hidden jems that I had no idea existed before I found this invaluable resource."
2,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!,"Not sure where to start and I don't want to write to see how i write. Mr. Skin must be getting commissions on the orders readers make per his recos. He and his group don't see ""naked"" with the same criteria. Some descriptions are understated, most are overstated."
1,Misleading and Worthless,"I read all the hype about this book and even read the reviews. I was sure that this was the book of all books regarding celebrity ""exposure"". My girlfriend bought me this book for Valentine's Day.We were both EXTREMELY disappointed!! This book has absolutely no worthwhile pictures in it! It is all in black and white! Plus all the information in the book is readily available on the internet for free!! What a scam...you buy this book only for it to tell you what movies to rent or buy to see the celebrities in. Good Job Mr. Skin...way to dupe the public and take their $25 too."
5,A fantastic resource.,This is a fabulous resource if you ever have wondered about your favorite actress and whether she has ever been in a nude scene before. I found several actresses mentioned that totally surprised me. A must have for any guys out there that enjoy their actresses and would like to see more. Thank you Mr. Skin.
3,"Good ginger, but not the pure, strong Ginger I was looking for","This is just for my taste, it may be perfect for you since it is not as strong as pure ginger itself.If you think pure ginger is too strong, then go for this product, otherwise this is too light."
1,wonder electronics is a wonder!,"To Wonder Electronics , I WONDER how wide the label tape is ? Duh , How am I suppose to buy it if Wonder electronics doesnt even tell the most important specification of the product. WHAT IS THE WIDTH OF THE TAPE ?"
2,That's it?,"Almost a year has passed since Jay Farrar put out ""Sebastopol"" and now here is an ep with only 4 new songs. I thought the point of being a musician was making music?"
1,decline continues,Sebastapool was junk and this is worse. Farrars lost it. Why he released this is beyond explanation.
3,Worth what you pay,"It's not a $200. plane but it's better than what Stanley sells at twice the price. It took over thirty hours of work to tune it to the exceedingly high standards of my college hand tools class, but when done it was as good as the $200. planes. Yes, I wish the mouth was adjustable and the other adjustments were smoother. It is worth what you pay and can be great if you invest some sweat equity."
2,Footprint Smooth Plane,Footprint used to make high quality tools in England. This tool was made in India. The external appearance was very good. The internal finish was terrible. There was a big bur under the frog that kept it from making good contact with the sole. The bottom of the lugs of the lugs that contact the sole were uneven. The bottom of the sole was far from flat. About 10 hours of my time were required to correct these problems which should have been corrected at the factory. What I got was a kit that I could make into a useable plane.
2,Another Disappointment from CHINA,"I agree with the other reviewer that this product is a coarse but fixable tool. And it is of similar quality to other planes in this price range. BUT, I bought this plane specifically because I did not want to buy yet another product that was outsourced to CHINA. The box the plane comes in was printed in the UK but has a sticker on it saying made in China and and the UPC code was masked out. It makes me wonder if this is some kind of special order dumped on the US market. The product is OK but I dont like buying a product from a place where workers are in poverty, children slave in factories, citizens have no rights, and there are no pollution controls. I really wish that AMAZON would be more clear on the country of origin of the prouducts they sell."
1,Cracking the Branding Code,"Am I the only one who has recognized the cover similarities between this book and another about codes? I'm certain that these two very proficient marketers didn't randomly select the title or cover layout. Maybe Dan Brown, the author of the most successful adult fiction of all time, should have his publisher look into this ""coincidence"". And by the way, I'm not a DaVinci Code fan. Like all other entrepreneur and self-help book authors, Hansen and Allen figured out years ago that all you have to do is repackage the same ideas. They were more clever than most by branding with Brown's blockbuster. Glad I saved $2,000 and three days of my life on their seminar."
1,No substance,"I've read many of Robert Allen's books. This one was so poor I actually got angry reading it. It was a very thick book of meandering stories. A big chunk is about relying on a Higher Power, but not presented in any actionable way. I completely believe in the guidance of a Higher Power, a much better book on that topic is the 11th Element by by Bob Scheinfeld."
3,New title but same old stuff.,"Nothing really new here. The codes to ""enlightenment"" are simply frustrating. And the use of ""Higher Power"" is really silly. I understand that the authors wanted to use a spiritual term that was generic enough for their diverse readers, but ""Higher Power"" is just weak. I think over 80% of their readers wouldn't object to the term ""God.""Trying to reach the least common denominator usually takes us to the weakest point."
2,A Let Down,"As a reader, if this is your first look into enlightened wealth creation and the world of MV Hansen, then this is not a bad book to start with. However even as a first book it is incredibly light reading, and I would certainly recommend ""One Minute Millionaire"" over this book.In a nutshell the book lacks flow, trys to employ too many ""clever"" techniques in writing and really only covers most of the ground covered in other books by the same authors.Truly and unfortunate dissapointment"
2,too much fluff and recycling from other Allen works,"Too long. Too clever for its own good. The only saving grace are the handful of case studies. They provide great stories to share (as inspiration) with my marketing clients and workshop attendees. Much of the work has been outlined in other books by Robert Allen (ie Multiple Income Streams)Both authors are talented and successful as info marketers. They did a good job pitching the book on Christian media outlets.Copy their niching strategy to sell your products and services. But as far as the book is concerned, wait for the deep discounts to begin."
2,"Poorly written, overwhelmed with puzzles and garbage","I bought this book after reading the back cover, I did not flip through the pages first. It was a big disappointment. I think the core message is interesting and worthwhile but the book is full of so much garbage that it's hard to get to the message. If I want to solve word puzzles (some of them maximally inane-like the one where the words are simply printed upside down) I would buy a puzzle book. I think they had a great idea and it just got bogged down with so much clutter and nonsense that the message got lost. I definitely wish I had not purchased it."
2,Inspiring But Impractical,"This is an inspiring book which is a relatively good read for both dreamers and people who are on their path to making millions. There are many interesting anecdotes and in spite of the somewhat awkward layout, the flow of ideas is not interrupted. The concept of ""enlightened wealth"" may not be entirely new, but it's somewhat refreshing.But for the real millionaire wannabe who is ready for some action, it offers little practical advice. How much are your connections worth? How much is your life history worth? Alas, we are not Bill Clinton and even if we analyse our worth and our opportunities in the way that is taught in the book, that merely offers consolation and not real money-making tips or advice. Buy or read it for leisure only."
1,"Not all it's ""cracked"" up to be","Fortunately, I didn't buy the book, I checked it out of the library. After reading Allen's ""Multiple Streams of Income"", I thought it would be worth a look. ""Cracking the codes"" feature was also intriguing. Unfortunately, I've already found a couple of the codes actually have ""typos"" in them. On code #13, I just assumed it was a ""typo"" and entered it on the website as it was supposed to be. I got the full number of ""points"" for it. Big deal. It was dissapointing to discover the editing was so poor that the actual ""codes"" themselves wouldn't be correct. Bottom line: the ""codes"" are just a gimmick to sell a book with little useful content. While I don't usually leave a book unfinished, I'm already returning this one to the library."
1,Save your money !! Borrow it from your local library !!,"OK..Here's the deal.. the book is a novelty item, with nifty mind puzzles and some interesting anecdotes about people who made millions out of adversity. Production values are high (different ink colors, graphics to make it an MTV-generation read). It tries its best to conflate greed for money with the need for spiritual fulfillment, and it may actually succeed in helping some people get there. But after reading this book (ok, 2/3 of this book, before I couldn't take any more) I was left without any concrete steps to get there. Save the $6.00 (that should tell you something right there -- $23 book down to $6.. it's one step from the remainder bin) and borrow it from your local library if you're curious still to see what's inside.."
5,This is amazing,"This book is their finest work to date. Enjoy cracking the codes within the book - they are the greatest puzzles I have been challenged with. Anyone intelligent enough to take this book and put it into practice WILL become financially free. JUST DO IT! I have been a student of Bob and Mark for years. I did it and I am one of their many success stories. If I can do it, you can to. Get the book and follow the instructions. Thanks Bob and Mark - you truly changed my life."
1,Waste of time,"Its a complete waste of time ,,they Just state if you want something ask God..thats the end.."
1,Disappointed,"While the book did provide a basic guide to starting or expanding a business, the details are left to the suckers that enroll in the follow on seminars that just keep adding up ($1500 for the introduction; more cash for each area of concentration). Each step of the process requires more cash.I was disappointed, this book is simply a front for their own perpetual money making seminars. It should be retitled ""Empty Promises of the Get Rich Quick Scheme - How to Make the Authors More Money""."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I expected better from these authors. They, however, left me very disappointed. I thought I'd get some basic and practical advice. What I got was stroking and dreams topped off with a push for philanthropy from the earnings they don't tell you how to make. I resent that Hansen and Allen made a dime off me for purchasing this book. I should have read the reviews BEFORE I purchased. I would have saved myself time and money. Anyone what a free used copy? Never mind. It's not worth the postage."
5,Practical Eye opener,"The book is great, nice to read but what is most valuable are all the excercises, steps to follow and the [...]great website it has[...], This alone is worth 10 times the price of the book. The Audio version is also great because it is narrated by Robert and Mark. I purchased both and I read along while I hear the narration. (plain reading makes me sleepy)"
1,The worst book I have read in my life,Don't waste your money or time on this piece of trash. What they are doing is trying to cash in on the Da Vinci code with something that has nothing to do with the subject. This is so poorly written I can't believe it was published. DON'T PURCHASE this unless you want to revel at how bad it is.
2,Too many codes to crack,"The title is very catchy, but once you start reading it has a lot of landmines and hoops you have to jump to get through it. Very gimmicky with ""codes"" and puzzles you have to go their website to ""crack"". This is supposed to lead you to enlightened wealth; code words for pray for money."
1,Complete Waste of Time and Money,"This book is a joke. TONS OF FLUFF! They go on and on and on about theories and stories of others who made money. The only substance it has, which is very little, is nothing new. In the first chapter of the book they tell you to go out and talk to friends and family to get them on your ""team"". They say to talk to 100 people if need be, and oh yeah, TELL THEM ALL TO BUY THE BOOK. If you want to learn about obtaining wealth, buy a business book. It's obvious these guys are just out to make money and waste people's time. Truly sad."
2,"PU, this is a stinker!","Don't buy it, I'll sum it up for you...give 10% of your earnings to God or in doing God's work and then watch the bucks roll in."
2,Too Much Clutter,"While the book certainly has some great information, it has too much clutter to make for easy reading. I love quotations, but the quotations around the edge of certain pages are cumbersome to read. And the different fonts, the bold and italicized letters within words are very distracting. The broken text to hide a ""code"" to break, actually break the thought process.I think the book would be much better without all the distractions. Too me it is like an over-decorated Christmas tree. Less would be better. They (MVH and RA) have often talked about keeping things simple. They should do that with the layout of the book.I certainly endorse their idea of higher power - although it is not new - they simply put more emphasis on it than most.It is certainly worth reading. But if you are bothered by all the clutter, read the One Minute Millionaire instead."
1,Pathetic attempt,"I got this book because I found the title intriguing, but gave up reading it after slogging through the first couple of chapters of poorly-written filler. Shame on the two authors for trying to make money off of such a useless piece of junk. Usually, I can find at least one valuable piece of information in a book, but this one was the exception. Save your money/time and get a real book for entrepreneurs, not this one."
2,Not too functional,"This is definitely a cute little pouch which matches my pink RAZR very well.Unfortunately, you can only slip it into your pocket or wear it around your wrist as there is absolutely no clip on the back.Personally I like to have some versatility in my cell phone holder. Sometimes I'll want to slip it into my pocket or purse, other times I like clipping it to the outside of my purse or *gasp*, even my jeans! This case looks good but there's not a lot going on behind the scenes.If you just want a cute accessory for certain occasions..this is a good choice. If you're looking for something with a bit more functionality, this is not it."
4,That 70's Show-Seaon 1,I thought that this was a good dvd I mean I got it for a good price and I really enjoy the show so I would have to say that I'm really happy with the product.
5,Thanks,This came in a very timely fashion and it is a good quality. I would definitely purchase from this person again.
3,My favorite tv show of all time.,I will just link anyone who wants details on the product to a critical review so it can be explained better than I ever could.[...]
4,70s Humor for all Ages,"Alothough I was too young to get into That 70s Shows when it first aired, I got hooked immediately. All the insane situations the gang gets into will make your side rip open. Even those of us born after the 70s can understand the historical comedy in each episode. Though I find the third and fourth seasons to be the best, season one has its good points and lets you get to know the characters. I am so glad they finally released the DVD and hope the other seasons are soon to come."
4,great show,"this is a great series 100% funness!btw, might i recommend getting ""Dorm Daze"" and ""Boy Meets World Season-1"" out August 2004?"
2,Poor Product,"The box case to the season was torn and roughly bent on every edge. The disks were scratched. Overall, I was very displeased with the product."
2,Disc won't play,"One of the discs were actually scratched and will not play.It's the second in the set, and you can only play the first episode on the disc."
5,No Title,"I must say that That 70's show is easily the best show I've ever seen. I've seen some other good shows out there: Raymond, Friends, etc., but That 70's Show is the only show that I could watch 50 times everyday without getting tired of it. Literally, I think this show should be on more often, but I'm glad that it is finally coming out on DVD. I've been waiting since it first came out, and I'm sure that I won't be the only pleased person."
3,"Selena has a great voice + music, Graciela has a great voice","When I heard this album , which starts off with Selena, I thought it was great! The smooth Tejano/Pop sounds with Selena's great voice are really a great thing to be coming out of your CD player. When the first Selena song ended, I thought,""Well, No Graciela is coming, she'll probably sound good to""She did have a beautiful voice, but the music was bad. Harsh trombone and acordian sounds are scattered thru out all of her songs. And then came a Selena song which was smooth and sounded great! So it alternates from good/bad everytime, and that made me not enjoy the album that much. Id go buy a Selena album where she is the single artist cause Selena and Graciela are from two different music worlds, so you might not like one of the two artists."
3,Not bad,"This is an interesting book and is a good insight into the workings of the Cleveland mob. However, this story is tame compared to the New York families and their treachery.Worth reading though if nothing else than the insanity of the main character."
1,Kill the book,"I hate to throw any book away. But this was the proverbial exception to the rule. I literally threw it away before I finished it. It was actually laborious to read. The narrative jumped all over time and space - it was almost impossible to follow. And it reached the point where I just didn't care anymore. On top of that the editing was dismal at best. For example: The Irishman ""excepted (accepted) the deal..."" and, in describing a man who was often alone; ""He was a loaner..."" I'm sorry. I just couldn't take it any longer. I have a life...I'm not a loaner and I just couldn't except that lazy, careless riting."
1,Get me Rewrite,"The story of Danny Greene is an interesting one, but this book is terrible. Poorly written, lacking any kind of story-telling ability. There are great books in the true-crime mobster genre (""The Westies"" by T.J. English; ""Wiseguy"" by Nicholas Pileggi; ""Donnie Brasco"" by Joe Pistone) but this is defintiely not one of them. Unless you're from Cleveland and have a vested interest in the subject, ""forget about it."""
5,Comfortable from Day One,"Good stability. True fit. I go between a 9.5 and a 10. The 9.5 fits me well. The laces are meant to wrap the cleat, which I could do without. Great buy for the price. The cleats themselves a bit sticky on the ball."
3,Ouch!!!,"The second time I used this boot, I experienced an ACL tear.My last two boots (US: cleats) over the last 5 years were Nike. Average use: >1 a week (snowy winter considered). Compared to the Nike (Tempos) that I had, this boot has larger width, extremely longer laces, and deeper (non-rounded) studs. Those who have wide foot (my Nike boots had narrow front) don't have to get this one with .5 size larger."
4,nice cleats,A little long but fit well overall. Width is fine for me (I'm a little wider than normal/medium usually).Check around for price - I got these off amazon for around $30.
1,Wrong samples,"I wnted to listen to some samples and the samples are not the barrio boyzz music in some banda... whatever the heck that is, is not barrio boyzz!! fix it people!!"
3,Cute,"This is a cute exercise video made in the 80's. Barbie's large 3D rendered form was advanced back in the day. The only issue with this video is how quickly the exercises become. One moment barbie is raising her leg, next she is bending down to touch her toes then suddenly bending to the side. With the generation of the DanceDanceRevolution movement, this shouldn't be a problem. However to anyone who doesn't frequently work-out the pace is tiresome to keep up with.This is a cute video to collect."
1,terrible! Don't waste your money!,"My daugher could not keep up with this video. The instructor goes so fast, doesn't allow time for sufficient instruction-just goes right in. Of course, the girls in the video have had ample time to practive prior to the shooting of this video! Not fair! In addition, these girls look like they were injected with some kind of stimulant!"
2,bad,"I hate the girls in this video. They are ultra-skinny (looks like their parents keep on denying them food), have smiles too big to be true, and they are unnaturally pretty. Barbie never seems to get tired, if she was a REAL human she would tire out halfway though this junk. Everybody seems to have been taking a TON of stimulants. (Like the other reviewer said) Why do they have to make Barbie totally perfect? My eight year old cousin watched this and she hates it too.Hope I did some help,KP"
1,Fast is an understatement,"I bought this video for my 5 and 8 year old girls, who love Barbie and dancing. I don't think most adult exercise videos move this fast! New moves, none of which are particularly easy for a relatively inexperienced dancer, are introduced with minimal (if any) instruction. The instructor and dancers then do the move a few times, then incorporate it into the routine, then go on to introduce the next move. The first three moves are introduced within about 90 seconds (I timed it). After 5 minutes, my 5 year old just gave up and sat and watched the rest of the video. I'm glad I used a gift certificate to buy it, rather than purchasing it outright."
2,unrealistic,"This video is typical ""Barbie"" overly perky and filled with good looking and thin girls(they appear to be perfect -unattainable and discouraging to anyone who isn't). They all know the routine perfectly and it is very fast and complex. My 8 year old who takes dance could not get the steps down and was so frustrated that she will not even try it anymore. I would challenge adults to get the steps down.There is no instruction on the steps and even the warm up is fast paced and complex. I would not recommend this video to anyone."
2,Keep it simple....,"I'm still waiting for someone to write a book on 3-D modeling that is not cryptic, does not attempt to assume you know the direction the author takes in their instruction and just starts out with the simplest of routines. Guess I'll have to wait a little longer."
3,Decent for the Price,Its a nice looking book but feels flimsy. Also the plastic sleeves are pretty low quality and tear easily.
5,Just like everyone saying,"This is an unbelievable lens. This is the WOW factor when you see your image on PC, even in low light situation the image is just so freaking good. My 60D with 1.6x crop sensor turn this lens into 136mm and its take very good portrait photos and the bokeh is unbeliveable. The focus ring is super smooth and over all well built. This lens will stay with me forever."
5,Super,Super! I very like the lens. It so great for portraits and perfect price! The Amazon sent to me my lens very fast. Thank you very much!
5,I love it!,"Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 is my most favorite lens, I own the Canon EF 85mm f/1.2L series but I rarely use it, I am used to this lens better, it's affordable and great for portraits! I use it for all of my works. A MUST BUY LENS!"
5,Such a prime lens.,Has problems with chromatic aberration :[ (Purple hues on edges in bright light)Other than that I love it!
5,"Excellent, dont hesitant on buying","I purchased this lens a few years ago, it has amazing image quality on ""L"" level. best lens for the money bar none. do not hesitant on purchasing this lens... it even has a lot of advantages over the 1.2 L thats 2000."
4,Almost perfect,"This is a great lens. The image quality is very very good! I am having a little difficulty with the autofocus, but at this point it may just be my camera, so I don't want to fault the lens just yet. The focus speed is great.The only problem I have with this lens is purple and green fringing on areas of high contrast. Stopping down the lens helps, but even at F4, I am still getting some of this. With photo's this can be fixed, but with video there is no easy way to get rid of it. It is worse than any of my other lenses. If not for this, I would give this lens 5 stars. In every other way the image quality is really great."
5,Great lens,"I am a hobby photographer, taking mainly action photos of dogs and other nature things. I have found that I am happiest using prime lenses over zoom since the photos come out clearer and sharper in all ranges, and it's certainly easy enough to switch out a lens.This lens is GREAT! It is just the right focal length for an area I frequent with the dogs and my photos are coming out fantastic.Overall, this lens is one of the most versatile lenses I own. The f/1.8 is great for pretty much any lighting conditions I run into, and stops even the fastest jumping or running dog. I have some great snow shots taken with this lens...you almost feel like reaching out and brushing the snow off the dogs faces. Photos almost look three dimensional and there is a sparkle in each dogs eyes!Buy this lens, you won't regret it!!!"
4,Great Portrait Lens,"I bought this for Mother's Day for my wife and Amazon shipped it to me within 1 day, in time for Mother's Day, eventhough the estimated delivery date was a full week later. Awesome! Although we seemed to have some initial problems getting the lens to consistently focus, the problems cleared up the next day, probably a camera setting problem, and the lens has worked great ever since. My wife has taken some beautiful pictures with it and it is probably her favorite for portraits."
5,85mm Fixed Lense,Love this 85mm fixed lense. It has a fast focus and takes exceptionally clear pictures.
5,GREAT LENS!!,"I just got this lens and have only used it for a short time, but already I can tell it will be a favorite. The details when you print pictures taken with this lens are awesome! Very sweet lens for the price. I was a little skeptical of the fixed focus at 85mm, but so far it's not been a problem. Low light shooting is a snap with this lens! I would recommend it to anyone shooting indoors, or in low light. It's great!"
1,COLOR FRINGE!,"This lens has the most color fringe of any lens I have...purples and greens... I really cant use this lens at anything below 2.8 if you can afford it go for the L. I have read a couple other reviews of focus issues with this lens also, I agree... The copy I have misses focus quite a bit. I calibrated this lens to the auto focus drive on my 7D and it still comes out off focus more often than not. I will be returning this lens and not replacing it with another copy, even if the auto focus problem was fixed. The color fringe is just too bad. If you don't mind your well lit areas being outlined with purple then this lens will be good for you, otherwise whats the point of buying 1.8 aperture lenses if you cant use them at the widest aperture? My $100.00 1.8 50mm takes better pics than this lens. Seriously if you want the 85mm just save for the 1.2 L."
5,Great Lens!,"I bought this lens especially to take live action shots at high speed, fast action basketball games. I am still learning all of the functions of the lens and getting used to how it works, but so far I have had some amazing pictures. For the things I'm doing with it and the price you pay, it is SOO worth it! They shipped it right on time and I have been able to enjoy all the benefits of its f 1.8. its a great lens that i highly recommend !"
5,Beautiful,This is an awesome prime lens. I do both prfessional photography and film with this lens. Its my favorite lens. The colors are awesome and the lens speed is very nice! I would definitely recommend this lens
3,"Blur, Blur and Blur",This lense needs to be mounted on a tripod to obtain sharp (Non Blurry) images! Canon needs to add IS to this lense!
3,Very Confused,I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. I got this lens having read the many amazing reviews and now the photos seem blurry. Am I doing something wrong? I have a rebel t3i. Please help!
3,came defective,"i couldn't wait for it to arive, but when it did - there was a problem. it was defective - the autofocus was way off. i'm retrning or replacing it. i know may of you would think ""probably he's doing something wrong"" - i'm not. i tried with many diferent settings, and the focus was always way off the desired spot.oh, and do NOT select the ""Free Shipping"" option - it won't ship for 2 weeks."
1,Going against the trend on this lens,"I tried this lens on a Canon Digital Rebel XT. I'm amazed at all of the positive reviews. My results were very disappointing. Maybe I had a defective lens, but I don't think so. Great Bokeh. Fast Lens. However, this lens had a VERY DIFFICULT time focusing on a subject. Auto focus was way off. Even in manual mode, getting a sharp focus was a real challenge at F1.8 or 2.8. I switched my Canon Digital XT camera to spot center focusing and still had a difficult time getting a sharp image after taking many pictures. I would recommend testing this lens out before purchasing."
5,Wonderful!,"I am currently using this lens on a Canon T3i, and it is MARVELOUS! It rarely leaves my camera. HIGHLY recommend it!"
5,sharp and beautiful color,"One of the sharpest lens among L and non-L, color is beautiful. Price is reasonable. Build quality is solid, I have been using it for 6 years and it still looks like new."
5,Best Canon lens for the money.,"Probably the best lens for the money from Canon. Good build quality, very fast and quiet AF thanks to ring USM, good bokeh (background blurring), good color and contrast. Sure it is not as good as 135/2L or 200/1.8L, but at this price range you cannot find a 2nd lens come close in picture quality and overall performance. I have several Canon lenses and this one provide the best price/performance ratio. This should be on top of your lens list if you are considering EOS system.Pros:Sharp even at f/1.8, very sharp @f/2.8Very fast (f/1.8) for the money.Very fast and quiet AF thanks to Ring USM.Good build quality.Good picture quality.Cons:No bag come with lens.No lens hood.135/2L is still a better choice for portrait if you have the space for it.Canon should have put a red ring, L aka, on it to let let us feel even better."
5,This lens makes me look good,"I just bought two high quality lenses for my Digital Rebel and what a difference this makes over the kit lens which I wish I hadn't bought. I bought this one mostly for indoor and outdoor portraits of my kids and dogs. It is just amazing! I was surprised by how much difference a good lens can make. I've been playing around and I took tons of shots of my kids today and the portraits are amazingly clear with GREAT background blur -- I feel like a pro. If you use the aperature priority setting and play around, you'll see that you too can make professional level background blur even if you barely know what you are doing (this would be me). In short, invest in a good lens. Don't forget to multiply the focal length by 1.6 if you have a digital canon camera -- 85 mm is really 135mm or so, really a telephoto type lens. Great for portraits!"
4,Best Portrait lens for the money,"Simply put, you cannot beat the 85mm f/1.8 without some very deep pockets. Wide open the lens performs as well as many L zooms with apertures 1-2 stops slower. And at all comparable apertures, it beats my 24-105mm f/4.0L hands down."
5,Tack-sharp images,"I am a photo enthusiast and use an old Digital Rebel XT. I first upgraded from the 18-55mm kit lens to a 55-250mm zoom lens; but was ready to go for a prime. I wanted the sharpness/clarity of a prime and a faster lens to deal with lower light situations. I have had this lens for about a month and I am very excited with the images this lens was able to capture. In my favorites,the focal point is tack-sharp against a beautiful background blur. Because I had always used a zoom lens, I had to get used to moving myself rather than the lens to get closer or farther away, but the results are definitely worth it. With this faster lens, I can photograph in lower light and still keep my shutter speed at a reasonable point to capture and freeze motion. I love this lens."
5,Amazing lens,"I don't know where to start. It's sharp, fast, silent, beautiful. It takes amazing pictures especially in the dark. this was one of my favorite lenses and I really wish I could have kept It but I needed a 70-200 f4L. Highly recommended this lens, on a crop sensor it's equivalent to a 135mm and is great for shows, and such where it tends to be dark. Amazing for portraits as well."
5,My go-to portrait lens!,"Really nice sharp tight crop lens that compresses and blurs the background nicely. I can't say enough about it, it makes everyone I shoot look amazing!. =)"
5,great all around lens,bought this for my daughters karate tournements and i am very pleased with the quality of pictures i have gotten. this baby never comes off my xt
2,no instructions,Yarns were very cute but this product does not have any instructions on how to crochet. My step daughter just use this for making bracelets which was not what it was intended for.
1,HORRIBLE!,"My case is horrible... Already shows fading, cracked already from taking case off the phone. Never dropped the phone etc. Don't waste money on this case. Emailed the seller but they did not respond."
1,Only holds one card and fits poorly.,It's definitely a clearance item that the manufacturer is trying to get rid of. You're better off buying something else.
1,Stay away.,"The case took almost a week to arrive. You buy a cheap case, you're going to get cheap case quality. Stay away. The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all. Will scratch your phone. Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt. Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case. Thank God it didn't scratch the aluminium on the case. A credit card didn't even slide all the way down into the case. Good luck trying to fit two in there. Spend your money else where."
1,Worthless,"The phone does not fit into this junky case properly. Completely worthless and just a money grab by the seller. It was cheap with the coupon code because it doesn't fit! I tossed this case is in the trash where it belongs. I realize purchasing a cheap case is a gamble, but I never expected it be so bad that it doesn't even fit the phone. Completely useless."
2,did not fit properly and cheaply made,barely covered the side and didn't have a lip to protect front. also the plastic was very thin and was hard to take on and off
3,Ok item. Not that effective,"I bought this product on sale. I have always wanted a case that can hold my id and CC for certain occasions. This thing cam barely fit the iphone 5 and it leaves the front silver bezel open for scratches. The case also seems to small to it my iphone 5... Made too small. Also, it is impossible to insert two cards without separating the case from the phone. Ok product for the price"
2,iPhone 5,"The case does not fit perfectly on the iPhone5, hangs off the side a little where it touches the volume control button. Can only fit 2 cards in holder and the light blue case gets dirty easily."
2,Waste of money,"It doesn't cover my iphone entirely.The case is no longer white, I never have this kind of problems with other cases"
4,Nice,I was satisfied by this item.Cover looks very nice with the white iphone 5. Happy with my purchase. Worth for the price.
5,Will buy again,"Sturdy, good design, easy to install. I'm using it with a 22"" monitor and it holds it very well in place. Has swivel feature so it's always well leveled in the horizontal position. The color is solid black. I also mounted it on a concrete wall. I used the enclosed concrete screws. I was going to built my own using a satilite dish mount, but for under $100 I'm really glad I bought this. The quality is very good. I have it mounted on the west wall. I face the south wall. I extend it out all the way and the center of my monitor is 17.5"" away from the west wall."
4,Love with the live-in nanny!,"The Secret - Every time Adam Fortune gazed at his children, he knew they desperately needed motherly love. So, he hired pretty Laura Beaumont as their live-in nanny and thought his prayers were answered. But Adam soon sensed that something was troubling the young woman, because in her eyes he saw secret fears....and unanswered questions. And he knew that no matter how ddpely she cherished the children - or loved him - they would have to overcome the past so they could someday be a happy family."
2,Not Jones-Stephens,"This was suppose to be a Jones-Stephens product, but turned out to be Sioux Chief Brand. I could have bought it cheaper at any home improvement store. I was looking specifically for something to replace a Jones MFG drain product made in 1992 so the difference in brand was not appreciated."
1,You Idiot!,"The war ended over 100 years ago, fool. The North won, and no amount of your revisionist claptrap will change it. One star is too generous by far."
4,Good,This works and I really just got it to get some information of my palm. It has kinda become obslete because I use my phone for everything that the palm can do and more.
5,A great way to start collecting old gear,"I've been reading the author's website for a few months and bought this book as soon as I heard about it. I like that instead of it being a history book he gives hints about where to get the stuff he mentions. I wish there were more large pictures and they were all in color, but there's so much here that it's hard to complain too much."
5,A 'Must Have' book for every Civil War library,"What an valuable tome, Surley one of the most impressive collections of Civil War images ever collected. The introductions to the twenty-one sections are very helpful for appreciating the 400+ haunting Brady photos. I especially enjoyed the Federal Navy section, with photos I had never seen before, although I've read and edited several publications about the Civil War. Included also is a very practical guide to acquiring copies of the photos. In has been ten years since the prolific George Sullivan presented his biography of Mathew Brady. It was worth the wait as we have here an award-winning work that should be in teh history section of every private and public library. Not one of the 450 pages is disappointing."
4,Civil War Buff,"This is a great book of the U.S. Civil War! The pictures are crisp and clear. It is like stepping back in time, and seeing how the fighting men lived and died during our Nation's Civil War."
5,A snapshot of time,"Only slightly aware of the Brady collection, but a fond Civil War reader, it was a dual experience for me. One was the first person issue of the subjects in the photos... Flesh on the stories of previous books. The other was the snapshot of the times. Historically capturing the pathos of the labors and the ""technology"" of the day. A glimpse into the work and labors of the times, the pride of the workmanship, and the people that were in the portraits. Not simply a book for the coffee table, it is worth the story it tells. Show your friends, children and yourself the honest accounting of the war. Not gore and not glamor, just reality. Step forward into the history."
1,Libraries beware: DVD received was defective and the publisher wanted additional money to replace it,"We purchased this DVD directly from Amazon and the DVD copy we received was defective - it never played successfully. Patrons did not make us aware of the problem immediately, and by the time we tried to replace it Amazon's automatic replacement window had closed. So, we attempted to return it directly to the publisher. The publisher informed us that since we are a public library, we shouldn't have purchased the "" private use license"" (meaning the actual DVD) for $20 from Amazon, but a ""library license"" (still the same single DVD) directly from their website for $75. They offered to replace the defective DVD if the Library would pay an additional $55.I have no idea if the documentary is any good, as we were never able to get it to work on any DVD player, but I can bet it's not worth the Library paying out $75 to circulate."
4,Lots of Variety,"This is a great raw food book. Simple recipes without a huge, long list of hard to find ingredients. Lots of variety, too. Try the Roasted Bell Pepper Cheese and Mushroom Risotto."
1,Disgusting,"I am very disappointed with these pills. A small part of the problem was my fault - I thought when it said ""chewable"" it meant ""gummy"", and I wanted gummy pills. However, I definitely would've kept and continued using the pills if the flavor weren't absolutely disgusting! The pill is chalky and sticks to your teeth when you eat them and it's this awful medicine-lemon taste. I have to hold my nose closed while I eat one and follow it with strong food or drink. There's no way I could eat one plain. I was looking forward to trying them because people had commented on the taste being good, but I have to unfortunately very strongly disagree."
4,OS-Cal 500+D chewable tablets,My wife was very pleased with the chewable OS-Cal 500+D tabets. Thelightly flavored citrus taste and the comfortable size made taking them a pleasant rather than an onerous task. She has also been pleased with the doctor's test results for bone density and for the apparent effectiveness of the D vitamin in enhancing the absorption of the calcium.An Amazon verified purchase
3,They need more info,"This is calcium carbonate and not calcium citrate. This is not clear in the description. Maybe Amazon will add this. Some of us need citrate and don't absorb the calcium carbonate very well. However, that aside, the taste is pretty good. A little chalky but not bad. Just make sure your doctor says you can take calcium carbonate. There is a difference."
5,Healthy & Delicious,"The light lemon flavor tastes like a treat,but in fact, I am getting 500mg calcium &600iu vit D3..3/day & I feel my bones are strong !!"
3,Typical short FL Plossl EP,I got this a while back. Used it for about a year and sold it. It was an Okay EP but really any plossl below about 10mm will have tight eye relief (how close you need to put your eye to the eye-lens) and a tiny eye-lens to look through. Did it work? Yes. However I would say save your money for something slightly better.
4,Cute,"It was a nice product, although it was a lot smaller than I have imagined. Otherwise it was in good condition and the shipment got to my place on time."
3,"Quality is Hardly ""DeLuxe""","Way overrated as five star. Mass of uncut threads. Shapes from squares to trapezoids. Should be described by Amazon as ""seconds"", instead of ""Deluxe"". Rated generously at first as three star only because of low price. After using the washcloths, I lower my rating to one star. They are very rough, thin, turn grey in one wash, and wear quickly. If could have returned for refund including shipping and cost to return, would have done so. Gave rest of stack away for use as rags. Worst purchase made from Amazon. Either reviewers rating these highly got washcloths far superior to mine, or their reviews are fraudulent."
1,Save your money,These don't even make good polishing rags. They are coarse and not very absorbant so I just threw them in the garage in the rag bin and used them to wipe off grease etc from my bikes.
5,Williams Textbook of Endocrinology,"Excellent publication, very useful. Very recommended for those who require a broad vision of Endocrinology!"
4,Modern Cigar Culture,"I own a growing collection of books about cigars and this one is certainly one of the better ones. This book avoids being simply a history lesson about a pastime that was popular 150 years ago, and dives in to the here and now. It contains a lot of original and interesting contemporary cigar culture material that is quite fresh, and would be hard to find elsewhere. The text traces the journey of the author(s) as they move around the world interacting with cigar smokers and the culture that surrounds them. It also reviews 50 popular modern cigars from various locations. I&#65533;m deducting 1 star because I think the book tries to be a bit too sexy, a cardinal sin amongst true cigar smokers, who don&#65533;t smoke to impress and often have to try hard to throw off the pretentiousness tag. However, make no mistake, this is a really enjoyable book that is nice to look at, quite modern in content and also rather unique."
2,No Eye Relief,I should have listened to the reviews here! There is no Eye Relief on this. It is almost impossible to get the whole field of view. This 4mm was worse than the extremely cheap 4mm that came with my FirstScope (I don't know how that is possible)! I only used this on terrestrial views and decided it was not a good purchase. I also bought the 9mm Omni which is much much better. Look for that review when skies clear so I can use it for non-terrestrial viewing.I am returning this item. It sucks I have to eat 25% of the cost on this EP but I found it almost totally useless. I will report back on how the return goes with the seller (Adorama).Update:Adorama accepted the return and the refund was quick!
2,4mm eyepiece,"Very tight eye relief. You almost have to place your eye against the lenses to see. Have a hard time focusing this lens with my scope. Should have tried a 6mm or a longer eye relief lens. I use my 10mm more, as I can see and focus easier."
3,It does what it's supposed to do.,"It does what it is designed to do. It is a 4mm eyepiece of pretty good quality. I bought it for my 4.5"" reflector telescope. My scope has a 1000mm focal length, so I was hoping for an awesome 250x magnification. Well I got the 250x magnification, but the image was not very awesome. Yea, I know, I exceeded the recommended magnification for my size scope, but I had to find out for myself. The image through my Celestron 10mm eyepiece that came with the scope is much better, and the Celestron 20mm eyepiece it came with better yet. This eyepiece may be better suited for a larger mirrored scope.My main issue with this eyepiece is that it is uncomfortable to use. The eye relief is VERY short. I almost have to have my eyeball touching the lens to see the full field of view, and my eye so close that my eyelashes constantly press against the lens and get in the way. Not enjoyable."
3,It's OK.,"I bought this item for my celestron astromaster 76 eq. It is made up of metal and well built. However,it cannot see venus on it's own (For my telescope that is) and it is too powerful to get a good focus on the moon."
4,does the trick but not perfectly,"i got this the other day. it was easy to install, it's got a simple and stylish design, and it seems like it's top notch quality so far. it's fully adjustable (horizontal and vertical) and clamps down hard enough. HOWEVER, when installing, use a level on the part that attaches to the tv, not the part that attaches to the wall. the tv side was not perfectly perpendicular to the wall side, so when i mounted it after only using a level on the wall side, my tv was not level. this may sound nonsensical now, but what i mean will be apparent once you actually set it up. otherwise, i'd recommend it."
3,Not sturdy...,"This is made of flimsy plastic. It does not slide onto the music stand firmly; the littl flap supposed to secure it to the lip of the music stand was wayyy tooo tight and can not push it without scratching the stand or break it... nah...waste of $$.I went to the music store and found the metal String Swing brand that handtight and easy to remove, very sturdy, and I love it. Great for use to place the violin/viola and bow on when needed to take a break from practice, but just want to mention that it make turning pages very difficult because the small bulky metal box for screw on is in the way."
3,Not very secure,"This violin holder is okay, but one should not depend that their violin will not fall off this holder. The plastic clamp-like device that secures the holder to the music stand is not very secure and can be dislodged from the music stand. It would have been better if Manhasset improves on this design (shortcoming). The holding system for the violin and bow also works around gravity and tapping the violin may dislodge the violin off the violin holder. For adults, I think this holder may benefit, but for children (with a dog in the house) this holder is questionable for home use/practice."
2,Brass Walls / LIES,I know first hand this book is filled with alot of untruths.I was personally affected by the lies in this book. It would have been a good book if sold as non fiction. He should of left the names of people out of the book if he wasnt sure if he was printing the truth. I hope next time he writes a book he gets his facts straight before printing someones name and a bunch of lies.
5,Highly recommend this book!,I have enjoyed reading this book and applying the different techniques on various Video Productions. I highly recommend buying this book!http://www.selahproductions.com/
1,EXPERIMENTAL??!!?? IT THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A PS PLUG-IN,"When i mean experimental typography and working with computer type, i except studies about ways to use computer and bitmap fonts - not experimental in the definition of ""vary you type case and your experimental"" or ""punk and bloat for experimental.""unfortunately i should have known that ANYTHING labeled experimental typography should be avoided. just study the classics and break it down yourself.vrdvyieort.com"
4,A REALLY GOOD BOOK,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. I HAPPENED TO READ THE SHORT STORY OF HOW BRANWYN WAS BORN AND WAS REALLY INTRIGUED WITH THE STORY. AT TIMES, THE STORY WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING (THAT'S JUST ME, NOT THE STORY) BUT IN THE END, IT WAS WONDERFUL. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF MEDIEVAL SCOTTISH ROMANCE, THIS IS A GREAT ONE TO PICK UP."
2,Average,"This is Who You Are is a letdown after Light a Match. The lyrics are sappy, the riffs less engaging, and the songs as a whole are lacking something. Where Light a Match showed a blatant disregard for pop sensibilities (and it worked) by switching from soaring melodies to brutal breakdowns, this record tries too hard to be accessible. As a result, there is no vitality. Where Light a Match depicted a band performing dark, grandoise emo tunes, This is Who You Are is a sappy performance of indie rock."
3,Hope for the future.,"I thought this album was pretty good. ""This is who you are"" is a beautiful song. I love its message of determination and perseverance. ""The seperation"" and ""Cold hands"" were also great tracks but I found the rest of the album kind of bland. ""Wide eyed and wasted"" showed promise but never got off the ground. Even though this album is lacking, the talent of the band is undeniable. I'm sure fans of Dredg will enjoy this album but I think the best is still to come form Beautiful Mistake. The band just needs to devlope their sound more and they will be a force to be reconed with."
2,so disappointing,"Let me start by saying that Light a Match... is in my top 5 cds of all time. I was pumped to go get this cd, but I regret it. There are like 2 good songs on this cd. And i don't mind in the slightest that there isn't the same amount of screaming here, its just annoying music. if it was well-written and interesting emo, i would've loved it. But this is just stupid. Yes, they changed directions and have a different sound, but that's not an excuse to suck. Funeral for a friend has done it very well. I hope next time is better."
2,Thoroughly Disappointed,"This album is such a disappointment after Light a Match. They have lost nearly all their intensity and aggression. There are almost no screams whatsoever on this album. The lyrics are so preachy, sappy, and cliche. I really loved this band and thought their last album was amazing. This album sounds like it should have been released on Drive Thru. The vocal performance is good but the lyrics are bad and the intensity is gone. The musical performance is actually really good, but unfortunately the songs aren't and the album is a step back artistically from their last work. This is what happens when hardcore stops being hardcore and starts being pop."
2,Disappointed,"I just got the album and none of the songs really caught my attention. I love The Beautiful Mistake. Light A Match For I Deserve To Burn was simply amazing, I loved their album and I thought this would just be an improvement on it. However, this album seems really different to me. It seems like they conformed a little bit to other punk/rock groups. They are missing what seemed to set them apart and make them more unique.I know some people say that no two albums should be alike, otherwise it isn't really an improvement. However, this just doesn't really seem like the band I loved.Maybe I just need to let the CD soak in first before I really enjoy it. I didn't like their other CD right away and had to listen to it a lot and then fell in love with it. Maybe this is the same."
1,The Ugly Mistake,"I personally believe they have taken the wrong path. I have seen The Beautiful Mistake live before and thoroughly enjoyed their style, but after seeing the video, ""this is who you are"" as well as listening to their other songs, I was disappointed. If anyone knew their music before this you would know they have definitely taken the ""mainstream"" route. Why? Could it be all the problems they have had, new members or input from their ""Star"" producers. The point is people cant take the screaming, I think that is what made their band. Maybe they all started going to church or they all have wives and children now.....the point is this new CD sucks and you can get this type of music anywhere. I want the old Beautiful Mistake."
2,title of review,"This band is incredibly conventional. It sounds like they've taken what Mineral, Jimmy Eat World, and The Get Up Kids were doing in the 90s, and drained it all vitality. Smoothed off the edges and made it into something that would fit perfectly on mainstream radio between Creed and Linkin Park. The songwriting isn't bad, but they should step outside the box a bit more, exercise some creativity, not be so formulaic."
5,Great eyepiece for the money!!,"The eyepiece works great. The price was also a lot cheaper than anywhere else I looked, and I looked for a few days. If you buy this eyepiece I hope that you have a equatorial mount as well. This eyepiece gets you so close to the objects your looking at that they are not in view for very long. It also helps to use another eyepiece such as a 10mm or higher to find the object and then swap it with this one. I have not been able to look at Saturn or Jupiter yet as they are not out. But looking forward to it."
1,Never Received,"I never received my book when I ordered it. I contacted the seller several times to see when the book would be shipped and he only responded once,, but never shipped my book. I ordered my book at the at the beginning of February. I WOULD NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN!!!!!!"
3,Not quite pure dynamite,"Tom Billington, the Dynamite Kid, tells his story. It is the story of struggling, winning, enduring and surviving. Unfortunately, it is also a story of bitterness. Billington speaks out on many aspects (good and bad) of his career and wrestling in general. As a book independent from any current wrestling organization, this had the chance to be an in-depth look at everything. While Billington does give great details at times, he also comes across as too bitter at times. He does seem to have valid reasons for bitterness, but the book would have been much better if he would have concentrated less on this part of his great career."
4,very good book about bitter wrestler,"This book was very good, as it lets you in on alot of the goings on inside the business. Dynamite comes across as being very bitter, which I guess he has the right after seeing how he is in a wheelchair in his early forties. It brings to light that probably a majority of professional wrestlers are true jerks with huge egos in real life outside the ring. Dynamite is no exception. I'm sure the British Bulldog has his faults, but Dynamite portrays him as being totally useless and seems to blame him for much of his current plight. I would highly recommend this book to wrestling fans as it is very entertaining and informative."
4,pure dynamite,I found the book to be informative and insightful. It tells stories I'd heard many times with an alternate prespective and includes stories I'd never heard before. Tom Billington's book is well written and an easy read but I did find it a bit self serving in what it lacks and very honest in what it contains. I'd recommend it to pro wrestling fans and those who read autobiographies.
4,Applaud the flawed,"This is a book about a guy who became a man at age 12. At 12 years old, Tom began training in professional wrestling and shoot fighting at a neighborhood gym under one of the greats. As time goes on he learns that the business ie where the money is going to be, is the BIG MAN business. He starts taking things to get bigger. When he makes it in Canada, he brings in his cousin Davey Boy Smith, which he would later regret. But Dynamite Kid is flawed in the fact that when he gets to a point of a disagreement, he says RIGHT and 1 of 2 things will happen. He'll break someones nose or he'll never work for a promoter again. It's a tough world out there, and an entertaining read."
4,A Unique Look at Wrestling By One of the All Time Greats,"Pure Dynamite is a unique book, written by one of wrestling's most gifted wrestlers, the Dynamite Kid. Many wrestlers have written books way too early in their careers, before they've accomplished enough. Dynamite, however, is now retired and his book covers his entire extensive career. Dynamite pulls no punches with his opinions on other wrestlers as well as the business as a whole. Being a huge fan of the British Bulldogs, I was very entertained by this book. It was interesting to learn of some of the antics that go on backstage in the world of wrestling. Dynamite has an interesting sense of humor, but the highlight of this book is his pure honesty. A must read 1980's wrestling fans."
1,"Not a Foley status book, and I don't mean Mick...","This book was portrayed to be about the ""darker side"" as opposed to the lighter side, as in Mick Foley's ""Have A Nice Day"", but it really ends up being Dynamite Kid's bitter feelings towards the sport and people around him. I don't pretend to know the problems between him and Davey Boy Smith, but he makes Smith out to have childlike intelligence and can't do anything without him. The book is also particularly self serving (He's the greatest thing in the f'n world) and rarely breaks kayfabe. Whereas the Foley was open and honest, this book is one long drawn out self appreciation story. If you want to read about mid 80's wrestling in the WWF and Japan, give it a shot. If your looking for a book like Foley's, tap out now..."
4,Lol Creme then & NOW!,"Strawberry Bubblegum SHOULD be followed up with a 2nd CD titled ""Strawberry Soundtrax!"" The 10cc boys were always great. Single & solo!Eric Stewart has a solo CD out & is working on a NEW recording. Graham Gouldman & Kevin Godley have recorded about 10 new tunes together for download. I hope they put their songs out on CDNow Lol Creme ,Trevor Horn, Steve Lipson, Chris Bairde & Ash Sloan are in a NEW band called ""The PRODUCERS""So finding Strawberry Bubblegum was soo cool to hear. Ther is enough song that Hotlegs recorded & session from Strawberry studios to put out 2 more CD'sSo folks if you love 10cc then buy this cd it's fun & maybe we'll get to buy the rest of their tunes not heard in ages on CD. These boys were & still are Powerhouse rockers! They are like wine they get better with age!"
1,Item might be good but not 47th Street Photo,"Item might be good but if you decide to buy it get it from someone else and not 47th Street Photo. I ordered this and four other similar items two days ago and I just got an e-mail stating that they are ""out of stock"". However, I just checked the item again and found out that they are still offering it."
4,great book!,This book has wonderful allegory that compels one to be noble and pure. It is a page turner (especially the last half)that is in ways comparable to Tolkien's works. It has extensive characters which come to life and plot that is quite enjoyable.
5,Take a close look.,"I've just finished reading The Crown of Eden, the first book in the Seven Kingdoms Chronicles, by Thomas Williams, and am very interested to learn more about this author and his writing. I've found little to no information about him on the internet. The most I know is that Word Publishing (Thomas Nelson) is the Publisher of this book.The parallels to the gospel, and Christianity, that are woven into this magical tale of a Medieval world are amazing. And the way in which they are woven is nothing short of genius. I love the book, already love the author, and am desperate to learn more of him, and when the next books in the Chronicles are coming. I highly recommend this book, and encourage the reader to look closely to find for themselves what the writer is really writing about. Keep your Bibles handy!"
1,Not as pictured,"This is not about the book The Phantom of the Opera. I love the story! This review is for this particular copy. The picture shown is of a copy which was illustrated (beautifully) by Greg Hildebrandt. I used to own it and lost it, and have been searching for a replacement. What I received was a regular unillustrated copy of the book I already have. I imagine the sellers just looked for the coolest picture to sell the item, but this particular image belongs to a particular copy. So heads up!! If you're looking for the one with Hildebrandts illustrations...look on. This isn't it."
4,ITS NEVER TOO LATE,"ITS AUGUST OF 1999 AND IT'S ALMOST 2 YEARS SINCE THE RELEASE OF THIS ALBUM. THE SONG TITLED ""DEJENME QUERER"" IS AT THE TOP OF THE CHART ON ROMANCE RADIO STATIONS AND IN DEMAND IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, IT APPEARS IT HAS A NEW LIFE - THE LYRICS APPEAR TO BE TIMELESS, SINCE MAY / DECEMBER ROMANCE IS HERE TO STAY AND SO ARE ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT FRIENDS SAY ARE NOT FOR YOU. THIS 2 YEAR OLD SONG IS PLAYING AND SELLING OUT IN EVERY RECORD STORE IN TOWN AND SO HERE I AM AT AMAZON."
1,LOS TUCANES DE TIJUANA,"LES CONTARE LA HISTORIA DE UNA FAMOSA PERSONA, TODOS LA CONOCEN CON EL APODO DE CHONA, TODOS LA CONOCEN CON EL APODO DE CHONA, SU MARIDO DICE YA NOSE QUE HACER CON ELLA SIEMPRE VA A LOS BAILES Y SE TOMA UNA BOTELLASE ARRANCA LA BANDA CON LA PRIMERA CANCION Y LA CHONA LUEGO, LUEGO BUSCA BAILADOR"
5,"A ""must have"" for anyone orgazinizing a group event!","This book includes various types of ""group related"" games suitable for kids and adults. The types of games described in this book range from icebreaders, sit-down games, active games, relay games, parachute games, and group participation games (i.e. a story is read while the group provides the ""sound effects"" -- promted by a particular word or phrase in the story). This is the ONLY book you'll ever need if you're ever called upon to organize games for a group event."
4,Colorful musical western.,"This one's a musical western with Deanna Durbin trailing her man out west via wagon train, her father (Ray Collins) in pursuit. Not much plot: along the way she falls for another (Robert Paige). But it's colorful (technicolor, in fact) and scenic with plenty of decent Jerome Kern music and some good comedy, primarily by a couple of foreign-type scoundrels (Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey) that reminded me of the Duke and Dauphin of Huckleberry Finn. The supporting cast includes Ray Collins, who went on to play Lt. Tragg on Perry Mason, June Vincent (That's The Spirit) and George Cleveland (Gramps on Lassie). Not outstanding, but if you love old musicals, you won't be disappointed."
5,very well done,my mom melane asked for this movie because she liked deanna durbin.good movie about life in western frontier.I really liked it too
5,"Cheerful, Wonderful Settings, Great Music","Deanna takes a trip to the west and takes along a large trunk that is taken off the train. She finds 2 men who she asks her to carry it for her. They start doing this but they take it in another direction more than once. The highlight of the movie is the title song done with the gifted voice of Deanna Durbin. At the end of the movie all of the many friends of hers get together to sing and dance. This movie will make your heart sing, it is that good. I recommend this movie for musical fans, but also for those who enjoy a good movie. It is a musical comedy that is thrilling to watch."
5,Great database book,"Good work Thomsen, this is a very good database book for use with VS.NET. I really like the detailed explanations of the many classes in ADO.NET and especially the handling of row changes. I must add that I actually like (unlike all other reviewers it seems) the property and method tables in the chapters as it makes it easy to use the book as reference when coding. I think typed datasets needs better explaining but that's the only things missing."
4,Great book,"This is definitely one of the better books I've read recently. The details in this book is simply great and I'm sure the author has put a lot of effort into the book.I liked the SQLXML coverage, but the best bit was by far the Exchange server subject. Although it was one of the smaller topics in the book, it was really good. This is the only Exchange server sample code I've seen working, really cool.Had it not been for the tables, 5 stars would have been my rating."
5,Good database book,"Great book with all the details needed to get up to speed on not just ADO.NET but also MSMQ, Active Directory, and SQLXMLThere are a few things that can be imporved, such as moving the many tables out to an appendix as suggested by other reviewers,or just to end of a chapter? I still think the book is well worth a 5 star rating because of the many tips and detailedinformation. I like chapter 8 the most but chapter 6 with its Oracle coverage is also worth a lot to me."
1,Very poor book,"After reading this book I found that ADO.NET didn't add anything new and/or interesting compared to ADO. Everything in this book is bad: The content covered is plainly missing the point of databases in .NET, the samples are pretty bad and way to many pages are used to reprocedure the help file contents. Even the website where we should be able to download the sample code is not workingLuckily for me I borrowed another book that told a different story: Databases in .NET and ADO.NET rocks!!Don't buy this book!"
1,"Not a good book, not for profesionals",This book does not have in-depth concepts also transactions a big fault. I could not find anything on DataGrid. Do you think this is a Database programming book covering ADO.NET? I prefer not!
1,Waste material,"If you care about your $$, look for something else. Addison wesley's ADO.net is a good one or go for MS Press."
5,Rock solid,"A bit of an ""old"" book but still rock solid information presented in an easy to read fashion. I did find a few minor inconsistencies but not enough to deviate from the 5 star rating."
1,Poorly organized,I wanted to give it a 1. It has less database programming and other miscellenous topics are every where.
2,I don't get it,"Ok, I don't get it. I bought this book based on last reviewers feedback and I'm disappointed. In brief, this is what I found:1. No in-depth ADO.NET concepts2. Author spends too much time on MSDN tables (classes, methods and properties). Doesn't make sense.3. Using Author's custom databse ""UserMan"" is confusing. If you don't understand the database schema, you'll certainly get lost.4. Didn't find nothing on DataGrid and other data-bound controls.5. I'm still looking for transactions and a concrete sample on concurrency.Good luck."
2,Decide before write,I found this book unstructured and out of flow. How about author first decide before write. Putting things here and there don't make a book. Book has more unrelated topics than real database programming. I found how book discusses basic DB concepts and targets advanced readers. Look at ADO.NET Essentials.
1,A very Useless C# text Book,"The book is useless, and I am a teacher, so I know what I am talking about. No wonder I was able to get a used copy for that cheap. Every body who buy it is trying to get rid of it. I looked through it once and never took it up again.This cannot help anybody. It like reading something in a newspaper. No way to apply it."
4,cd purchase,this is very good. I bought this for my wife and she likes it very mouch. SHE saw the musical in new york city.
3,"The music is fun, but the voices...",What can I say. I guess you don't have to have a great voice to sing on Broadway. A lot of my vocal students love this CD. I can't get past some of the unhealthy singing. But it is fun and I know it is very likable. To me it is one that I think would be much better to watch as a show then to listen to as a CD.
2,Overrated.,"Fun musical, indeed -- a great and uplifting show to watch. Not deserving of all the hype nor awards, however. There were many musicals not even nominated during the 2002-03 season that had stories with real substance and whose cast members were way better. The fun also doesn't cross over to the CD. The show is better seen than heard."
2,"Shrill, squeaky, and actually annoying.","I missed the previews on Broadway last year, which started a week after I had left, but I was terribly excited to hear the cast recording. Except for ""Without Love,"" ""I Know Where I've Been,"" ""(It's) Hairspray,"" and ""You Can't Stop the Beat,"" I was actually quite annoyed with the shrill and squeaky voices all around. If all that is supposed to bring one back to the early 60's, I'm real' glad I was too young to know any better. This is definitely not an easy listen, and actually staggeringly traumatic on the ears and senses."
2,Un-deserving of Tony or Grammy awards!,"A generally entertaining show. Not theater awards-caliber, however, and definitely far from The Producers. The quality of recording also leaves much to be desired; it's made worse by the squeeking made by the actors throughout this musical.Overrated. Use your amazon.com purchase on another item."
2,Two stars is being nice...,"This has got to be one of the first musicals I didn't like. With the exception of a few songs (there are about seven that are enjoyable, but still, that's less than half!), the rest were simply awful. I cringe every time I hear Harvey Fierstein sing, especially in Timeless To Me! Trust me, skip Hairspray. Instead, check out Wicked with Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. Now there's an amazing show!"
2,Okay,"Very funny. But there's really nothing beyond that. After seeing it win so many awards and now after having seen it myself, I agree with those who say that it IS indeed overrated. I've seen better shows and heard better albums. While this one is memorable, it certainly isn't of Tony (or Grammy) caliber. The judges were definitely swayed by the hype."
3,"Fun, but a pain to the ears!","The beat of the songs is great, and the musical, fluff as it is, is actually fun to watch. The voices and the delivery of the songs are very annoying, however. The voices, as many, many peope have pointed out, are squeaky, and the general sound of the entire musical is just too shrill for comfort.It's certainly not a waste of money to watch (it is a waste of money, however, to buy the CD without watching it first), but don't expect anything that qualifies for a Tony award so you won't be disappointed."
1,Buy another (any other) cast recording.,Be sure to have earplugs when listening to this awful musical. I saw the show. Absolutely dreadful. The nasally Monica Lewinsky look-alike in the lead will cause one to wretch. I like camp. Not all camp is good. This camp [stin]ks. Save your money. See another show. Buy another (any other) cast recording.
3,Overrated!,"I like Marissa very much and had fun watching this. Compared with the major productions that graced Broadway last season, however, this pales substance-wise and form-wise. You can't even call the ""singing"" in this musical real singing. It's all squeaking, like, as some people have pointed out, what newly-crowned WB Supestar & Queen of Ghoul Fantasia Barrino does in all her numbers on American Idol.Enjoyable to see, but not fun to listen to (unless you've seen the musical), and definitely not deserving of any of the awards it received."
1,"Not Sondheim, but fun for the masses...","Definitely not Sondheim, but this score will delight mass audiences. Though it lacks any intellectual depth whatsoever, 'Hairspray' is a mildly comic account of a fat young woman with an unusually small brain - but a big heart! Mindlessly escapist and often pathetically blatant, this ""boozical"" touches on the racism of American society and resonates with ""classic"" 60's structures. Marissa Jaret Winokur (Tracy) has an appallingly poor voice but manages to capture moments of sheer personal pain in her shrill and often childlike whine. 'Hairspray' doesn't bank on any particular story line, but tries to hang on to Winokur's painful drone."
1,Overrated!,"Fum musical, but as many, many others have pointed out, non-deserving of any of the awards it received. Story is fluff, voices are squeaky. No real singing going on here. And this is a musical?"
1,Overrated!,"Nothing impressive at all about this whole production, except for its upbeat music. The voices are horrible and there's nothing to the story at all. Customers are right: it stole the Tony awards from other, more deserving productions."
1,Squeaky Idol Fantasia Barrino should do well here,"This would be a good musical for Fantasia Barrino. She could put her squeaking muscles to excellent use, competing with the squeaky voices of the overrated cast in this overrated show. One star through and through."
4,"music is fine , shipping was a pain","love the music , is great hearing the original interpretation , dont get me wrong loved the movie, really impressed with travolta's ""Edna"" but the show stopper ""You can't stop the beat"" should not have been re-arranged , is very pale compared too the OBC , as well as the missing songs from the show"
5,"""Hairspray"" is divine!!","The best musical comedy in years. I looked around the audience and found everyone with a smile on their face from beginning to end! The cast superb! This is just what New York City and Broadway needed! Long live 'Hairspray""!!"
3,The music is fun but the voices...,What can I say. I guess you don't have to have a great voice to sing on Broadway. A lot of my vocal students love this CD. I can't get past some of the unhealthy singing. But it is fun and I know it is very likable. To me it is one that I think would be much better to watch as a show then to listen to as a CD.
2,Candy Fluff,"Hairspray is yet another musical adapted from a film which to begin with was not very good. The first thing that set off this CD was Winokur shrill, popish voice. In the show admittedly she does have more acting than singing, but if you are just hearing the CD it is really painful. The show on stage is entertaining with colorful designs by Long and Rockwell, however there isn't much actually substance to the show. Who came up with the idea to deal with the reasons for ending segregation with ""Run and Tell That!""? This upbeat number with repeatedly states ""the darker the berry the sweeter the juice"" really does deal with the weight of the matter. Overall, I guess it is entertaining, but if you are looking for any kind of meaningful plot, emotion, or vocals, buy a different CD."
1,I never got the cd,"the vendor never returned phone calls, or responded to emails. I never received the cd. I had to download it, which is probably what I should have done in the first place. I had never had issues in the past. I was very disappointed in this vendor."
1,"Yes, overrated","I was expecting to be ""blown away' by this supposedly award-winning musical. I came out disillusioned and with a bloody ear to boot from all the squeaking done in this recording. The actors can't sing! As someone else has pointed out, they all sound like AI winner Fantasia ""Donald Duck"" (per Simon Cowell) Barrino imitating cats in heat! Plus there isn't much to the story. The only appealing elements are the costumes and choreography -- and they're not on the CD.Don't waste your money on this CD."
1,Overrated musical!,"For a musical that supposedly won the Tonys and the Grammy, one would expect a much, much better product than this one. The story sucks, the actors suck, the singing sucks, the music sucks, the whole production sucks. Don't waste your money on this overrated excuse for a musical."
1,I'm sorry but I don't like this edition,"I received this a a gift. I've never seen the broadway play with this cast, So judging their acting, I can not do. I love the2007 movie musicaland the1988 original movie. So when I got it, I gave it a try. The 2007 movie cast has much better vocals. Marissa Jaret Winkour (Tracy Turnblad) sounds so babyish, it's something I can not give a second chance. Her voice is a lot better onMama, I'm A Big Girl Now : The 2007 movie edition. Harvey Fierstein (Edna) sounds like a Heavy cigarette smokingT-Pain. The only decent voice is Mary Bond Davis (Motormouth Maybelle Stubbs). She sounds good. But the other cast members do not. Given the fact that I've never seen the play and that the cast of the 2007 movie have better singing voices, I think I'll Stick with2007 movie musical soundtrack. The singing voices by this cast are just plain horrible"
1,An overly-hyped talentless show!,"One would think that after receiving so many praises, that its lead actors would at least take singing lessons to justify the accolades they don't deserve. Yet, when Marissa sang at the Tony Awards, she was still off-key (nothing remarkable about the voice to begin with, but that's tolerable for a so-so musical; the inability to hit notes correctly is intolerable, however, for someone who is supposed to be ""the"" best MUSICAL actress of the year). And Harvey F? The man is adorable is talented, but he CAN'T sing!The awards speak more of the caliber of the Tony judges (zero credibility) than the quality of this overrated musical."
1,Horrible!,"Whoever said that this was an excellent musical must either be deaf or hasn't seen ANY show at all, that listening to the squeeky voices singing cheesy songs in this poorly-crafted production provides lots of pleasure to his/her senses.This is one show that's way, way out of The Producers' league -- it doesn't even compare to the some of the shows that opened on Broadway this season (A Year with Frog and Toad, Gypsy, The Look of Love, Urban Cowboy) in either form or substance. The show does provide a few laughs -- for those with poor comic tastes.Watching this show is a waste of money, but getting the CD and just listening to it (without having seen the show that's bad to begin with) is pure torture."
3,Okay,"I saw this musical on Broadway. I found the music to be fun and the '60s feel 'groovy' (although appreciating it would depend on whether you like '60s atmosphere or not). The casting was interesting, with the ugly voices and everything (although I think Marissa and Harvey played their roles well). Overall: a wonderful musical.The weakness is in the fact that one needs to see the production itself to appreciate the recording. Since it's shrieky and shrill, those not used to ""non-quality singing"" and who haven't seen the show prior to buying the CD would hate it, which is why I'm not surprised that it's been getting such flak. Also, while it's a show that one would certainly enjoy watching -- it's pure entertainment -- that's exactly what it is: it is not your intensely moving musical that goes above mere entertainment. In this sense, I agree that it is overrated in terms of awards.My advice: Buy the recording AFTER you've seen the show. (You'll enjoy it.)"
2,Slickly Botched,"The disclaimer is that this is a review of the cd, not the score, which is wonderful. The problem with the recording is that it was produced by the composer, Marc Shaiman, who has mostly worked with incidental film music. This score needed a producer familiar with theatrical sound because the score is easily the best thing about seeing the show live. What we get in this recording in a slickly produced (overproduced) pop record that favors the lead vocals while treating the accompanying music and vocals as background (in the truest sense of the word). The urgency and fun of the music is lost here, and this recording lands with a hefty thud when it should have sparkled to life. Oh, and the percussion is really loud, too, perhaps to try to give the recording a Wall of Sound-like quality. It just ends up being distracting and overwhelming. Hopefully, the show will be recorded live, or it will eventually be remastered. For now it's a lame souvenir of a theatrically vibrant score."
2,Not Impressed.,"For all the praise and awards that this show has garnered, I was expecting something-ANYTHING better than this! Over-produced, and under-talented, I found this as the biggest waste of my money and it went straight to a used CD store!I understand it's supposed to be the anti-musical musical, but there is something to be said for occasionally hitting the right notes-maybe not all the time, but at least once a song-is that asking too much for a Broadway smash?Bottom Line:The story's a shmaltzy feel-good parading around like a serious matter, and that's not too bad-but the music-your money would be better spent buying ANYTHING else!"
2,Mediocre faux 60's schmaltz,"OK, OK, I get it! She's trying to sound like the Ronnettes, right? Yikes, is that ""Oh, Oh, Oh,"" nasality annoying! The show is no Bat Boy or even Lint! The Musical for that matter. On the first listen, you'll know where each song is going because it's a total ripoff (not an homage) to a song from the 60's. So much potential, so little return."
2,Okay,"Not bad -- in fact, very entertaining. But awards-wise, NOT deserving of the Grammy and certainly not the Tony. There are other musicals out there that should receive these awards.If you just want to have fun, though, this CD is worth checking out."
3,Fun!,"But I must agree with many reviewers: it IS overrated (very overrated, I must say). I enjoyed watching it, but I couldn't believe it won over the many excellent musicals the 2002-03 Broadway season offered.But do get the album or see the show if you get the chance. You'll be on your feet dancing in no time!"
4,"Infectious, but not breath-taking","My school show choir did Hairspray and so I listened to the music to become familar with the show. Sure, it doesn't take my breath away but ""You Can't Stop the Beat"" and ""Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now"" always make me smile. And honestly, my favorite songs are all the ones that were in the medley we did at school; ""Welcome to the 60's"", ""(It's) Hairspray"", ""Good Morning Baltimore"", ""It Takes Two"", ""Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now"", ""I Know Where I've Been"" and ""You Can't Stop the Beat"". I will admit, Melissa Jaret Winokur's voice can get a tad irritating but I have to give her credit for being able to SQUEAK through an entire show! Thats a unique talent! I love Penny in ""You Can't Stop the Beat"" and Harvey Fierstein in just about every song (Again, not a stop in your tracks voice, but infectious all the same). I love to jam out to Hairspray when I'm alone and belt out some of the parts. So yes, while it's not the most amazing singing ever, it's likeable and really cute!"
1,Save your money and skip the ironic re-re-hash,"The buzz is just fizzzzz. Another sung-through stage play with music. Everyone's been comparing it to The Producers (because it's a new stage version of a movie, with music), but this does not compare in any way to the craft of The Producers: a musical-comedy. The camp and quality of John Waters' 14-year-old movie was minimal and does not even come through in this production. Sadly, this emperor has no clothes."
5,Can't stop the beat!,"I absolutely love this one. It's been ages since I last heard a CD on which I've become hooked! The whole score is fun, fresh, sassy, emotional... and irresistibly funny. In my modest opinion, I think this is the stuff musical theatre should always be full of... I didn't really know Marc Shaiman's work until now... but this is amazing. The tunes are catchy and witty, and the cast does a great job in bringing them alive on this CD. I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested at all in musical theatre."
1,Bad! Bad! Bad!,"I can't believe I rearranged my schedule and flew to New York to see this show. It is sooooo OVERRATED! It's fluff and the songs and actors don't make things any better: the songs are cheesy and the squeeky voices are so annoying I couldn't wait to get out of the theater!I wouldn't even think of purchasing the CD, nor wait for it to win the Tony Awards. This shouldn't even be nominated!"
1,"Fun and good, but yes, OVERRATED!","There's no question that a show can be both entertaining and excellent, but this lightweight musical, with its lighweight theme and poor quality singing, is certainly NOT in that category. Amour, Take Me Out, Nine, Movin Out, Flower Drum Song, Urban Cowboy, and MANY other musicals that do not necessarily make you laugh and sing, but make you think and touch your heart, are more deserving of recognition. Indeed, someone hasn't seen any good shows lately. If Hairspray is your benchmark for a top-quality musical, that raises questions about your taste and theatrical aptitude."
5,Fantastic Show,The music was really fun. The costumes were bright and awsome looking. The acting was also fantastic. The sets were awsomely decorated. I loved this show. I would go see it again in a heartbeat!!!!!!!!
5,Great wild fun!,I thoroughly enjoyed Hairspray. The music is fun and exhilerating. I just saw this in Los Angeles. What great energy. The lead woman actually sounds even better live then on the cd.Other CDs I recommend:Avenue QPassion (Sondheim)AssassinsProducersSweeney Todd- my Favorite- Get the DVD and watch it!HairsprayLittle Shop of Horrors- the movie still rocksLa Traviata- the best operaThe Boy from OZandVoice Lessons To Go (both volumes)- So you can learn how to sing with all of the performers!
4,Worth The Hype,I have seen the reviewers butcher this CD. I however enjoyed it a great deal. The numbers are fun and upbeat. They don't take themselves seriously either which could be a terrible thing for a show like this. Some numbers however are not as good but I just skip over those. The show is fantastic and the CD is excellent as well.
5,This was absolutely great,"I am by no means a musical genius but I do know what I like and I certainly love this to death. This is surprisingly upbeat and could be construed as somewhat sappy in some parts but there are a few self-confidence songs (Big, Blonde and Beautiful speaks to me.. at least in 2/3 of these choices.)As to the voices of the actors & actresses that are in here, I do agree they're not exactly not Oberlin Conservatory calibur but I do think that their voices fit here in since I vividly remember seeing the original movie and if the Turnblatts(sp??) were allowed to sing in that movie, I'd think they'd sound like the way it sounds on this soundtrack."
1,Overrated!,"I love Marissa and think this musical is fun. I would not classify this show (and the annoyingly screechy-sounding voices on the CD) as theater-award-worthy, however, and I think it was grossly unfair to all the great musicals that were on Broadway last season that they didn't get the recognition THEY deserved because this show STOLE all the attention."
1,Robbed OTHER musicals of awards THEY deserved!,"The music might be fun, the songs delightful to sing to, but the musical has absolutely no wit, no soul, and worse, no talent! Squeeky-voiced Marissa winning the best MUSICAL actress trophy? How about don't-know-how-to-sing Harvey winning the best MUSICAL actor trophy? This show is grossly OVERRATED and, while ""entertaining"" -- as some people who want to be polite have described it -- should not have even been nominated.Feel free to see the show, but spare your ears the pain of listening to the horrible CD!"
1,Overrated!,"The critics are right: the music is so-so, the story is fluff, and Marissa and Harvey CAN'T sing. No wonder the Tonys have lost all credibility.The voices are very annoying to listen to. Skip this CD; you're better off listening to the shows that have already closed this season."
3,Enjoyable!,"Songs have a nice beat. This is a fun musical that's not to be taken seriously.Yes, it's overrated (doesn't deserve any of the awards it won), but it's worth watching. Very entertaining!"
4,Good Collection But...,"This is a awesome dvd with some great moments from WCW Nitro history, but it also has some questionable ones. Events like Bischoff and Russo taking away all the belts and the title match with Russo. The first dvd is all great, classic WCW moments from the first appearance of Hall and Nash to the reformation of the 4 Horsemen. The second dvd seems to mostly focus on the decline years of Nitro. I wish there would have been interviews with people from the Attitude Era to give their thoughts on Nitro, but i guess its been done to death in the Monday Night Wars dvd and The Rise and Decline of WCW. All in all though, a good dvd for any 90s wrestling fan."
3,"Not the best, but not the worst..","The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro7/10..Have gone through two discs so far of the Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro and am somewhat satisfied with what I've watched so far. I think WWE could have made a more in-depth documentary style presentation, but they already presented that on The Rise and Fall of WCW and in my opinion the best DVD WWE made, The Monday Night Wars. Lots of good matches I've seen, some I've forgotten about. Definitely a DVD they just pieced together. Good addition to WCW fan library."
3,it's good,"The video good some great matchesthe WWE did a rush job, you could tell the by way DDP was selling the DVDand you are already watching the video ?"
4,Good DVD,This was a good DVD with alot of the glory days of Nitro. I only hope there is a volume 2. Good for old fans to relive those days and for new fans to see what they missed.
1,are you serious?,I still dont see how it's the best of Monday Nitro without Chris Beniot The man was apart of the 4 horsemen let alone the great matches he had with Dean Malenko(had to give it a 1 to publish it doesnt deserve a 1 dont buy)
3,Needed a few more matches,"This is a really good set and I don't think any WCW fan will be disappointed, but I would have like to have seen a few more matches. That is not to say there is a shortage, but sometimes they focus to much on the NWO invasion and not enough on the matches at the begining. Listen I know the NWO is what put them over the top, but throw an entire match in while you build up to that. With all that being said it is still a great disk and if you are a WCW fan you will really want to get this and enjoy. Lord knows this maybe all we get from Vince and the WWE."
5,An enchanting story that is of legendary proportions,"This book is definitely one of my favorite books. It is an amazing story of a girl named Ilena and her astounding courage in facing her fate that awaits her at Dun Alyn. It is full of puzzles and twists that keep the reader on edge throughout the book. Just when you think you have figured out the puzzle another twist appears to make you hunger for more.The way the book is written also helps to make this book wonderful. It is told from the view of Ilena as the action is happening, making it personal as well as exciting for the reader. Ilena is easy to relate to and to sympathise with which also contributes to the meaning of the story. Patricia Malone also does an excellent job of exploring the social and political problems of the time while still making the characters easy to relate to and keeping the plot clear. This book will continue to haunt you long after it is read, it is definitely a legend in itself."
4,Great Story and very enjoyable,"Thsi book is great and many people have never seen nor heard of it before. It's not a popular book though it should be. It has a great plot and interesting characters. The reason it's 4 stars is because of the tense the book was written in. Every book, except this one has been in the past tense, but this one is in the present tense. It's VERY annoying at first, but you eventually get used to it. BUY THIS BOOK! VERY VERY VERY VERY Good book, aside from the tense it's written in."
3,A bit predictible,"I have to admit I found this book a bit predictible. Of COURSE the main character will turn out to be heir to a throne. Of COURSE they will win the battle. As an adult reader, I saw that coming from the beginning. The only twist I did enjoy was the way she was discovered to be the heir (don't worry, I won't ruin it for you).Also, the first person point of view was hard to read. It lacked the emphasis and suspense that a different point of view would have offered. Even in battle scenes, I didn't quite feel the energy the author was trying to portray.Overall, the book was not bad. Recommend it to older readers who already have an interest in Arthurian legends and British tales."
5,Great Cable!,Huge improvement over the El Cheapo cables I had. Movies on my PS3 now look sharp and the colors are so vivid. The build quality on these cables are exceptional. Monster tends to overprice their cables but it is well worth the investment.
2,Note the huge price drop,"Monster has been peddling overpriced HDMI cables for years. And for years, lots of people have been saying that there's no reason to pay that much. Now, Monster cables that used to be $100 or more are a fifth of that price. Still overpriced, but that should tell you something. The market has spoken and people have finally become wise to the hype. I feel bad for those who bought them a while back and paid top dollar. Caveat emptor."
4,informative,"this text although I did not use for more than 5 days a quick preview indicates helpful techniques, qualified information easy to understand to the point and quite detailed, I would recommend text for any nursing student"
2,Nursing book,"This book was a required text for my nursing course and the book itself was very helpful for skills lab. Compared to the bookstore at school, this was a very good deal. However, I wasn't too happy about the condition of the book. I purchased a brand new one and paid extra to have it shipped overnight. The book arrived to me in a very bad condition with the first chapter all torn off and sloppily glued back in. The books condition wasn't worth my money."
4,Fun for an older Belle lover,"Worth the money if you have a Belle fan. Better for children five and up as some of the activities(setting the table, Cogsworth's library) are tough for a preschooler. Visually beautiful and up to Disney standards! It runs well on our laptop."
4,"Interesting, funny, entertaining read.","All of Tara Harper's work is well-written with sympathetic characters and just the right amount of conflict. This one in particular is unusual from her other work in that it is strictly hard science fiction. But Tara really entertains in this little novel. A quick read, but wonderful and seamless in her storytelling. I thoroughly recommend it for one of those days you just want to get lost in a good story."
2,I did not like this book,"I was very disapointed in this book. As a person who consider themselves a ""Traditional Catholic"", I would never recommend this book to anyone. It was very biased to the Novus Ordo Mass and would not be a useful tool for anyone who holds fast to the Latin Mass and understands the serious crisis in the Church today. The book tries to compare the Novus Ordo Liturgy with Christ's first Mass. That is not possible in my opionion and I could not buy it. I bought this book to give to a Protestant Friend who does not understand the history of the Mass. Needless to say, I will not be passing it on. I will stick with, ""How Christ said the First Mass.""On a positive note, it was well researched. I will give the author credit for that."
4,Absolutely incredible....,"I would give this game 5 stars, but it does crash every now and then...save often! Basically, this game is so addictive, I have trouble thinking about anything else. Grrrrr! Hah, maybe I should dock it another star for that. This game is a bit slow paced sometimes, but that is not really a draw back in my opinion. I like taking the time to walk around and explore things and not feel rushed. I like FPS's as much as the next gamer, but a good RPG should me a more immersive experience. This is one of the best you can get for your Mac."
5,You can't miss it,"BG is one of the most exciting games that I've ever tried (and I've tried hundreds). Wonderful graphic, astonishing sound-design, catching story, many side-quests and total freedom of movement.Unfortunately, it has some technical problems and it crashes often. Thanks to Graph Sim which did this bad conversion for our beloved Mac."
1,Can't get the right software...,"I haven't had the chance to play this game yet. It shipped originally with the software for the expasion pack: tales of the sword coast. Tales is a supplement to Baldur's Gate, located on cd 6 (along with the installer for Baldur's Gate). This game is shipping with only the first five cds so I can't even install it. I have returned it twice and have finally asked for a refund."
1,No installer included,"This is a complete rip-off! If you buy this game you will not be able to install it unless you buy ""Tales of the Sword Coast."" But they don't tell you this on the box or on this web-site. Don't buy this game!"
3,Too unstable to be truly enjoyable,"In between marveling at the glories of the AD&D I remember playing in my youth tranformed into a very complex and deep computer game, I get to sit through endless reboots of my system. I play this on a 256M RAM, 600 MHz iMac running MacOS 9.2.1 and goosed the game RAM assignment by 10,000K --still it is horribly, disappointingly unstable.If you take the plunge, save frequently!"
2,STUPID GAME,"I found this game frustriating in the extreme. In play it was hard to go anywhere in the game, but I'll never truly know because it continually crashed my computer until I was so fed up I uninstalled it. The little play I did accomplish wasn't enough to get me hooked, so I haven't bothered to reinstall... such is life."
1,Won't run on 64mb,"Hi,I have been waiting for this game for 8months. I received it the other day and quickly found out that even thought the box says 64mb required, which I have, it will not run for long without crashing, taking the mac with it. I run a 350mhz iMac with ati128rage, and 64mb ram , tons of disk space. So I am very disappointed with this product. When it works it's great, but that is not often. Maybe I will send it back and get Diablo II!"
2,"Sorry, it's a little late!","While Baldur's Gate is an exceptional game, it is to little to late. This game cannot compete with Diablo II. If you are going to spend you're hard earned money on a game, buy Diablo II. It has beter graphics, plot, and is by far the better game. Graphic Simulations took so much time that when they finally released the game, they had to deal with Blizzard's epic game. All I can say is, ""Sorry, Graphic Simulations... you should have kept your deadlines... it would have made you more sales in the end."""
1,Don't believe it until you see it!,"This mythical game has been ""due any day now"" for a whole year! If you want to order it, be prepared to sit, wait, and be disappointed!"
1,There Will be no Installer,"There is no installer included!!! If you buy this you will be forced to buy Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, just to be able to install it. If you are looking to buy this game, then buy the BG/Tales combo pack. Please listen to my words and do not be as dissapointed as i was."
2,disappointed by the poor quality of this product,"- The silver part has a cheap looking. Both poles have rough surface and I could hardly pull the stopper (sorry don't know if this is the correct name; the removable part that you put behind your ear) off the pole.- The tortoise part looks like plastic and has a dim cheap looking. I'm still not sure whether it's real tortoise or not. It doesn't have that nice smoothness and luster that good tortoise has.Also, this product is way bigger than I thought, but that's mistake on my part. I didn't pay much attention to the size.All in all, I would rather pay double the price to get a nicer product, because I don't feel like wearing these at all. I'm going to return them."
5,Boat is ship shape now,"We have a fiberglass sailboat and found that it stained terribly. I tried cleaning the orange stains with Magic Sponge but wasn't successful.A dockside friend (who has a boat cleaning business,) told us about this product and then demonstrated how easy it worked on stains. After having tried other products and scrubbing to no avail, this product removed the stubborn stains with very little work involved.I am so sold on this cleaning product that I went online to find out where I could buy it as it wasn't easy to find locally. I plan to try it on my shower basin which didn't come clean with Magic Sponge or scrubbing either."
2,"you would think, why 2 stars for m&ms?",they tasted great but the price was rediculous for the volume. If I wasn't over a barrel for a particular recipe I would not have purchased them.
3,A bit on the DRY side,I was rather disappointed with these titles.the fight scenes where simple and unimaginativethe characters are somewhat shallowthe ending is unclearbut as an elvish epic story it was best then mosttzah
3,In Search Of Manna: Your Guide to Glyconutrients and Mer8idians,"I was displeased that there are some of the top corners of some of the pages in this book torn, or not machine cut properly. Pat Hess"
1,Great resource for someone who has never used a camera,"I am not sure who the intended audience is for this book. The Editorial Review, which includes statements like ""Written in a clear, detailed, and fairly thorough manner, this book will be of great value to amateurs with limited experience"", indicates that this is an introductory text.Although it clearly it was intended to provide an introduction to the subject, sections like ""Film Loading"" ... ""Check to see if there is any film already loaded in the camera ..."" seem far too elementary for just about any reader.Unfortunately the book never progresses far from an extremely simplistic overview and provides little value to anyone with any experience, however limited, in the field."
4,Photography- explained,"This book explaines the different techniques of photography and how to use a darkroom, it is really interesting and helpful for the begining photographer."
3,Not What I Expected,"I did not read the print carefully enough. I wanted the Calcet Calcium Chews and ordered this product in error. I'm sure that it is a totally reputable product, but it is not what I wanted. My error."
1,This is an honest waste of money,"I need a case for my Zire 31...so ive been looking around and recently came upon this little gem...ok, not really a gem. actually, a piece of cheap, cheap plastic that has a piece of velcro inside. Who wants to stick a piece of velcro to their pda? Not me! Can you imagine how uncomfortable that would end up being, holding your pda and feeling the velcro on your palm (excuse the pun) all of the time? Honestly.Dont buy this...dont even think about it. I moved on after seeing it with my own two eyes...dont take your chances.It is way too expensive for what you get...i mean, although it is called ""hard case"" there is nothing hard about the plastic. It seems really flimsy."
3,THIS CASE IS HARD PLASTIC,"That was the only thing that surprised me when it showed up. it looks like it could be something else from the picture. Maybe that was just me, I have seen palm cases that look like some type of metal but now that I have gotten used to it I am glad it is plastic. It protects my Zire, it fits perfectly and has the coordinating colors if thats what you are into. Its pretty affordable I have seen it as low as $10 and you would want to spend at least that to protect your palm. Not crazy about the velcro attachment but at least it is detachable."
2,PAINTED hard plastic!?,"Ick! I've had this case for only a couple of months and I've noticed the silver paint on the outside of the case has been flaking off in my purse! Not only are all of my purse items, lipstick, wallet, etc covered in tiny specks of silver paint, but the case looks awful! The protection it gives is otherwise satisfactory, but who wants to whip out a speckled case that looks like I fished it out of a garbage can during a business meeting?!? It's not pretty! I got the PDA to look more sophisticated and organized (I'm a grad student), and now it looks I can't take care of my own stuff!! Needless to say, I'm on the hunt for a new case. Alas, it was a gift to me, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. A classmate showed up with the same one this week, and I'll be discreetly checking it out to see if it does the same thing!!"
5,"Great product and yes hard means anything hard..it does not say aluminum, etc..","yes it flakes if u use it alot, but hey at lease it protects the pda very well. It is not too bulky for me. I even bought another one off ebay.com when the original one broke and yes things break, everything can and will most likely go out and or break after awhile. The velcro doesn't feel that bad on my palm and would recommend this pda case to any pda user out there that just wants basic protection and doesn't want to spend alot of money. ^_^I love this case and currently use it for my zire 31."
5,Worthy to become a Christian Classic!,"Senkbeil has blessed the body of Christ by penning for us in his own tight, creative style, what should become a basic, classic work for Christians. The problem and solution are quickly laid out for the reader, then all the other elements of a believer's life are revolved around this center. Explains concerns that many pastors have with the ""hot tub"" christianity that so permeates our times. His sections on sacramental focus and liturgical shape are brilliant!"
3,additional adaptor may be needed,I haven't put this up yet. But it is sturdy and seems good.Warning though if your TV isn't vesa standard(mounting hole patterns in the back of tv) then you will need an additional bracket adaptor. it costs $80 and they don't tell you that until you have ordered this one. With both combined it will be cheaper than the stores mounts but I would liked to have known ahead of time and ordered both together.
5,Great articulating arm mount,"Product is very strong, but requires an underlying wall stud. Placement is limited by the location of the Stud. Easy one touch manipulation of the arm and great flexibility in positioning the TV."
5,Solid build for the price,"If you are looking for a solid, articulating, wall mount at a great price..this is it. I was a little concerned about using it for a 40"" LCD but felt better once I opened the box.Suggested improvement: you may need some washers to prevent the accompanying mounting plate screws from ""digging"" into the back of your t.v.; may not apply to you depending on your make/model. My particular make is the Samsung Model: LN-T4066F"
5,"nice unit, but.......","unit works well with my tv situation, but i had to buy an adapter bracket to fit it to my 32"" lcd tv. the adapter bracket was as expensive as the articulating wall arm unit, thus doubling the cost. i think the adapter bracket should come with it!! very pleased with final result. ps my tv is about 31 pounds."
3,Sleek look ruined by required add-on adapter plate,"I loved the look of this, until I tried to fit it to my Sharp Aquos 32"" TV which has a VESA 300x300 mount pattern. You need an additional ""adaptor plate"", and it costs over $100! It's a piece of metal with holes, for heaven's sake! So I bought it, and now I am disappointed - the combo cost over $200, and it's ugly. The adaptor plate sticks out and it's just gross. And the plate also prevents the TV from going back flush against the wall as it might have done with just the basic articulating arm mount.How difficult would it have been for Peerless to have simply put in a few extra pieces of metal to reach the 300x300 mounting holes? It's a Sharp 32"" TV - not like some obscure brand."
3,"Beware, piece of the puzzle is missing","I'm giving it three because it wasn't clear just what I needed and I'm hoping the thing doesn't fall off the wall.I bought this because at the top of the screen it says ""Peerless Articulating Mount for 22""- 40"" Flatscreen TV's"" and I had purchased a 40"" tv. Well, two weeks later, when someone is helping me hook it up we realize it doesn't fit. WTF??? Scouring Sony's website is no use. It doesn't give mounting information. Another look at the product specs on this page reveals ""Product Description: The Articulating LCD Wall Arm supports 22"" to 37"" LCD screens."" Once again, WTF??? Did I buy the right one or not? The Peerless website said it is compatible with this (Bravia kdl 40v2500)TV, right???? Nope, oh wait a second!!! It seems that there's an ADAPTER PLATE that I also need, in addition to this mount. No big deal, another $70. However, had I known this I would have bought it by now. Thanks so much for making it clear."
4,"Easy to install, but may need expensive adapter","I bought this wall mount for my 32"" Sharp Aquos LCD tv. I figured the 100 dollar price was good for a mount that would allow the tv to swing out, tilt, and rotate. Unfortunately, once I got it I realized that neither the mount nor the adapter bracket included would fit my tv. That meant I needed to buy a separate adapter plate, which was another $100.00. Being unwilling to spend the money, I came up with my own solution (drilled holes in two flat metal bars from local home improvement store, total cost of $8.00) and made it work. The rest of the installation was quite easy (with two people), and the mount is solid and works as advertised. I recommend visiting the website for Peerless to see if the mount will work with your tv, or if you need an adapter plate."
5,Just Perfect!,"It's perfect - easy to install, well finished and sturdy. Does what it's suppose to do at the right price.An earlier reviewer mentioned needing an additional adapter, but this was not the case for me. The kit comes complete with the proper mounting plates and adapters for VESA 75/100/200x100/200x200 mounting patterns - I didn't need anything else to hang my 32"" Sony LCD XBR4. Everything was included in the box.I am extremely pleased with this product."
4,"Sturdy product, but not universal","Great, sturdy product and allows a good range of viewing options. Unfortunately, this is not a universal bracket and the final cost with extra parts ends up a little expensive. I have a 37"" Polaroid LCD TV and it required an additional part for $80:""Plasma Adapter Plate for Viewsonic N3250W"". Wish this would have been obvious from the start and maybe I would have purchased something else. Check the Peerless website for compatibility before purchasing."
5,Peerless LCD Wall Mount review,"The Peerless SA740P Articulating LCD Wall Mount is an excellent product in ALL respects. It is one of a few products I have purchased, in the past year, that lived up to all the the marketing information I studied before buying. It was very easy to install and the instructions and variety of installation hardware were perfect. I would strongly recommend this unit to all of my business associates and friends."
5,"Great Wall Mount, Easy to Install and Affordable","Got this mount for my 37"" Toshiba LCD. After I received it I was concerned that it wouldn't hold the T.V. because it is fastened to the wall with only two medium sized screws. But, it seems to be holding up fine - I believe it is rated for up to 80 lbs and my T.V. is only 50 lbs.. Has a great range of motion and the price is great. It was also very easy to install."
2,I need another adaptor?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"I bought a Sharp Aquos 37"" LCD. Amazon advertised this on the page with the tv so I figured it ""must"" fit right along with it since they have them together. I get it only to find that I have to spend ANOTHER $100+ on an adaptor for it to fit the tv!!!!!!! That's some poor sales techniques by Amazon and I am NOT happy. Assuming you have a tv that it fits, it does look like a sturdy mount."
4,"Very Sturdy. Be Careful with the ""Better Together""","I bought this wall arm and it seemed perfect. However, you need another plate to mount it to a 32"" TV. The holes in the included mounting plates will not connect to the screen. After I received this and figured out that I need another plate, I went to the ""Better Together"" link and ordered a product Amazon had paired with this item called a ""Universal Plate."" The description on that item had no screen dimensions. When I received it, the manual stated it was for screens 32""-60"" so it looked too large for my screen, as this wall arm is created for 22""-40"" screens. I returned the Universal Plate, but that ends up being a hassle. This is a great product though."
1,good to a point,"Had this one for 1 1/2 year slight sag with 37"". that lcd fried. got new 46"" that is 50.2 lbs only 2 1/2 lbs more than the 37"", a super thin model. peerless will not sell me a adapter or the newer non-vesa brackets that come with the newest model mounts. after all it is rated for 80 LBS. they have no kits available or plan on it. maybe I should start a new ebay business making light weight adapters for this mount. I'm sure they sold thousands of them.I guess what I'm saying is there is no support.just buy the same new model at $235 with the bracket assembly."
2,an arm without a wall,"This rig certainly works fine in ideal conditions, that is to say with the right wall, the right stud in the right spot.Otherwise, as good as it is, it goes straight in the attic under ""useless stuff"".No need to say that, even if I could install it, the cabling would still be a nasty snake nest crawling up the wall."
3,NIce but additional part needed,"I must admit I bought the wall bracket before buying a TV. Silly me thought brackets were universal . I bought a 32 inch Viewsonic and of course it did not fit to the bracket. Called both Viewsonic ( waste of time) and Peerless who were helpful, to tell me I needed part # PLP-VIEW32 which is another 75dollars. SO you need to be careful that the TV will fit the bracket. I think I will be pleased with it when it is finally hanging up the TV. I only gave 3 stars as I think it should have included for the price a generic universal adapter."
5,Nice Mount,"Just put my 40 inch Westinghouse LTV-40W1HDC LCD up in my living room this weekend, using this mount. Like most other reviewers have said, it is rock solid! I let my GF hang on this to test it before I mounted our TV. It didn't budge. I am fully confident in this mount's construction. The adjustability cannot be beat, if you want to watch TV from nearly any angle, this mount is for you. I did a lot of research prior to buying this mount, and the price, the quality, and simplicity of this product are unbeatable. Highly recommended! :-)"
5,Works well.,"I purchased this mount for use with my 32"" Samsung LCD. It works perfectly and provides full range of motion."
4,Easy installation,I used this to mount a 26 inch Sharp LCD HD TV. I needed it to fully extend and rotate so that the display was perpendicular to the wall with the center of the TV nearly 24 inches from the wall. I didn't want the display to sag and it stays in this extended position at all times.Mission accomplished ! The mount was easy to install and adjust. It is very sturdy and holds this extended position very well. The mount even has nice cable raceways to hide cords. Sturdy. Well made. Easy install.
4,"Great Item, Frustrating Installation","This product is very efficient, I use it with my 32"" Toshiba Regza and it turns any which way and supports my TV very well.The installation though, was a little frustrating. In the instruction manual, each different nut, screw, bolt, tool, etc. is labeled a letter A-M. There are also small bags with these tools, each bag marked with a big letter A-M. Very handy for installation, right? Wrong. The letters in the book and on the bags didn't match, leading to a lot of confusion.All in all though, I'm not marking the arm any lower than 4 because of the integrity of the product."
5,good quality,"good quality product, hardware could be better. I used my own for wall installation (tap cons). Installed in 30 mins. Very happy would highly recommend this mount. Mounted product; 32in lcd tv monitor."
5,Awesome,"This is not the run of the mill wall mount. Very well made, sturdy, good looking and does the trick. Also, ordering, shipping and delivery were efficient and uneventful, on time and arrived in excellent condition. Thank you Amazon...you saved us a ton of money!"
4,works great on my 32 inch TV,"I bought this wall mount for my Samsung LN32A450 32 inch TV. I actually put the wall mount up a week before my TV even arrived, which made it so much easier for when the TV actually did come. I mounted it to a wood stud. My only suggestion would be to have an extra long drill bit for the 2 screws OR go extremely slow when screwing in in order to not strip the screws. Great product!"
4,quality and then some,"The product is of high quality metal. No crappy plastic parts to break. And, this is a big arm in that it extends out more than I need. I have noticed as well, that when it is fully out, the screen appears to be tilted. Though, not the case when it is pressed back against the wall. I might just be hallucinating, hard to say. And it could also just be a minor adjustment, more likely. Overall, it is a quality arm - does what it says it will do. I know that if you spend another couple hundred dollars you do get better articulating functions, a bit smoother in and out motion. Yet, if you are not going to be constantly moving the screen in and out and about, this arm does the trick. If you will be moving the screen a lot, and a couple hundred dollars doesn't break the piggy bank - then I'd probably go with the next level up in quality. With something like this, I like the product when I don't notice it and is just that. No big fireworks, but no big downers either."
5,Easy instalation,"Peerless PA740 Articulating Wall Mount for 22-Inch to 40-Inch Flat Panel Displays (Gloss Black)This product was easy to install. I have a 32"" LCD that needed to be mounted on a sidewall and this product was what I needed."
3,Capacity over rated,"I bought this mount for a Toshiba 40RF35OU. It works, but sags quite a bit. I wouldn't recommend it for anything larger than a 26"". It may be strong enough for its rated capacity, but the stiffness is inadequate."
5,Great prduct at a reasonable price,This was one of the better priced mounts I looked at and I was very pleased with the quality of construction and finish when I received it. It is more than sturdy enough to handle the job it was designed for.
2,Do your homework very carefully,"""Fits 22""-40"" LCD screens"" led me to believe that the SA740P was a universal mount. Not so. "" VESA 75/100/200 x 100/200 x 200 compatible"" led me to believe this would accommodate my 32"" Samsung 200 x 200, which required M8 screws. The pdf provided by Peerless (as of 12-13-11) listed M8 screws. The kit I received did not contain M8's, and the instructions did not list M8's in the hardware provided. The mounting plate was 100 x 100. I called Peerless to obtain an adaptor plate (free of charge), 200 x 200, and M8's. All this after first ordering a PP740 model, which also ""fits 22-40"" LCD screens"", but does not accept M8's. If your tv accepts M6's, these are great mounts. If you have M8's, get ready for a hassle."
1,Debbie Malone Album,"American Soul, not my cup of tea at all. Sorry I cannot rate this very high as it is not my taste in music."
2,Not easy to use,My mom and I were going to get a handprint of my 3 month old daughter. The directions say to mix to toothpaste consistency. I poured the mix in while my mom stirred. We thought it was ready and went to press her hand in and it was like cement. It was rock solid and we didn't get an impression at all. It was disappointing. My husband and I have one of my son's hand and it didn't seem as hard to create.
1,Totally useless,Will not recommend to anyone to buy this piece of junk! Followed the instructions carefully and the mixture was either too soft or too firm. It is really hard to leave a handprint even with an adult's hand.
1,From Mush to Mold,"It was difficult to obtain the ideal consistency; to soft, then too hard. When I finally had it somewhat acceptable, a sloppy print was taken. Several months later, I opened to to find it had grown mold! I let it set for two (2) weeks - open - , live in a dry climate, and haven't had mold issues with any other print kit, except this one."
3,Cute but be FAST,"This is a great keepsake, but since the baby wants to grab the plaster, you find yourself redoing it once or twice, when I got a good print out of both babies, it was drying so fast that I got an outline and ended up painting in pastel pink around the handprint which worked out just fine..."
5,tie rod end,"Item was a better price than anywhere else I checked. Arrived on time and fit like it should. The good thing is it has a grease fitting, so it will last a lot longer than the factory tie rod ends!"
1,An Introduction to Pro/SHEETMETAL (Release 20/2000i),Rafdinal Sjofjan Triftstr.67/50415 13353 Berlin
2,Fair Information - Poorly Presented - Questionable Practices,"This book provides moderate-quality information in that it does not generally provide best practices for completing models. The goal seems to be to create features for the sake of creating them, not to create the best possible model. Some of the modeling techniques employed are questionable at best. The lamp project is neither a good design nor easily manufacturable. Actually, I can't see any company ever trying to produce this product. Better examples could have been used to teach the techniques shown in this example. The book also did not take enough time to explain the ""why's"" about what was being done or why alternate methods weren't employed. Overall, the book provides a fair description of how to make some sheetmetal features but it isn't a good teaching guide.The Kinko's packaging job, photocopied text cheaply bound with cardstock and tape, is inexcusable for a book in this price range."
1,not worth the $$. online research is much more useful,"dont waste your money. this book is not up to date. your better off doing online research. i am looking to get into vet or vet tech school or some kind of equine rehab or medical research and this book is so far from helpful. it has a lot of trade schools and community schools, not what i expected."
2,Did not hold my interest,"I started reading this a few days ago, and picked it up again today to read on the way home. I had been considering purchasing it, but I'm glad I checked it out from my library first. The Wedding Gown really didn't hold my interest. A few chapters in, I could see where it was going and what would eventually happen, so I started skimming through until I got to the back. I prefer intriguing stories when I read romance books, and this one didn't fit the bill."
1,Intelligent??,"That anyone can read this book and conclude that it is an intelligent presentation is, well, not very analytical. This book is about as deep as a thimble flattened by a steam roller. Save your money, don't throw it away. I wish that more evangelical Christians were using their education to write thoroughly researched books without borrowing from others like C.S. Lewis (who was not an evangelical). Giles is not original, but then neither is Rick Warren in his ""Purpose Driven Life"" (he just borrows from tried and true psychology and mixes Bible verses in with it). So I wonder, ""Who is reading this stuff?"" Maybe some of the kids (the ones who are doing any reading at all), or some who put Harry Pothead down for a minute to read something else?? The church has gone a long way in my lifetime and it looks like it's just about to jump off the intellectual cliff!"
3,Still needs work,"The comprehensive system continues to be reviewed and modified, but Exner still isn't all the way there yet. The text has an overload of information, combining interpretation and research together in a way that is difficult to read. In addition, there are many questions about scoring that are not answered in the book."
5,A must read!,"I would like to recommend this book to any person from the age of 18 and up. Not only is it a ""guide"" for building a successful career, but it also should be applied to ones daily activities.Prior to finding this practical, no-nonsense book, I was doing very well at my current job as an Outside Sales Representative. But now, armed with this added knowledge from Mr. Gould's personal in depth experiences in the sales ""trenches"" I find myself shining and making a bigger impact. My customers see it, my co-workers see it, and my family/friends see it. This terrific book truly shows the potential within us all to excel in any field and in our lives in general. Thank You Mr.Gould!"
5,would recommend,"I am a medical sales rep in New Zealand, and would definately recommend this book to all sales reps. It is written in an easy-to-understand manner, in short chapters. I leave this book in the glove-box of my car, and it is a great read when I have a few minutes to spare.The content is motivational, acurate, and is universal for sales in all industries."
4,Thanks Deanna for all those films...,"Lots of reviewers did not like some of last films stating lack of material andnot as good scripts...but to me there all good. Watching those films is like belonging to one big Hollywood family of actors and actresses. You get used to them,their charm, and in the end when all is done...we kinda miss them . Cant get enoughof Deanna Durbin, and after watching all her films, i feel sad that there are nomore. She made around 20 and then left hollywood.Deanna ...thanks for that lovely voice you have shared with us...For the love of Mary is as good as others and Deanna continues her escapade, this time near the White House.Enjoy."
3,Roger Raglin,You get to see a lot of good bucks but the quality isn't great and he acts like a nut pretty often.
3,not worth reading,"AS A PERSON WHO HAS READ MOST BOOKS ON ALCATRAZ, I WANTED TO ADD THIS ONE TO MY COLLECTION, TO PICK UP ANY INSIGHTS THAT THE OTHERS MISSED...WELL, KEEP YOUR MONEY...JOLENE, NEVER MAKES A CASE FOR ANYTHING NEW, DESCRIBES MOSTLY SECOND HAND KNOWLEDGE, AND READILY ADMITS, THAT THE ONLY THING SHE REALLY REMEMBERS IS PLAYING ON THE CEMENT COURT YARD AS A LITTLE GIRL!!THERE ARE BETTER BOOKS THERE...MOVE ON..."
2,Keep Looking,"I purchased this book on ""The Rock"" and met Jolene the same day. I was surprised to hear that she had no significant encounters with the inmates. Her life on ""The Rock"" was very sheltered from the inmates. If you're hoping to read about her personal encounters you will be disapointed. This book is simply a compilation of mundane stories from others who lived on Alcatraz."
1,terrible quality control,I received this item with a broken switch. You would think that there would be miminal quality control before send such an item to customers
1,very cheaply made!,"The cable easily pulled through the supplied plastic retainer that's attached to the throttle pedal, leaving me stranded at the starting line, the day after installation.It was installed properly, with only the return spring pulling back on it, it was still able to pull the cable from the thin plastic retainer. IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Mehhh,"Barely lets sugar out, have to press the manual button several times and it comes out kinda clumpy. Still better than getting the box of powdered sugar out every time."
2,Not What I hoped ...,"I wanted these to place next to my coffee pot, one dry creamer & one sugar. I was not holding them in the cup when I dispensed, but the creamer kept clogging from the moisture from the steam coming from my coffee pot. The sugar works well, but not for us coffee drinkers ... doesn't hold enough to last a day; I am keeping one to put on the dining room table for cereal bowl sugar :) gotta add a lil sweetness to those cheerios."
1,Anything BUT Tranquil,"This CD leaves me anything but ""tranquil"". I was so irritated that I spent money on this CD -- and not a bargain either! It sounds like someone who hadn't finished their lessons yet, has no talent, but was anxious to make some money, so he slapped this together on a rainy afternoon, and gave it some catchy titles. If you enjoy random strumming and plucking, with an annoying and repetitive bass beat, then this is definitely your CD. If you love music, and are passionate about the harp, keep looking! ""Improvisations"" is an exalted way of saying ""I have no talent, and can't play real music, so I'm just going to pretend I know what I'm doing, and sell it for lots of money to any sucker I can snare"". I'm the sucker. I'm writing this review so the same thing doesn't happen to you. I will NEVER buy another Paul Baker CD!! And there is not a low enough rating for this one."
5,Out of THIS world!,"Out standing! Every home. school, hospital, church, vehicle and office ""should"" have one in their collection. I experience a deep sense of peace every time I listen. This music creates a very calm,safe and sacred space. I HIGHLY recommend this CD!"
4,Liked this!,Found what I was looking for...tranquil music for meditation! Would defnitely recommend this to others for evening examen and other times.
4,In LOS With Los Temerarios!,"I bought this cd because one of my favorite songs were on it ""eres un angel."" I enjoy all music by Los Temerarios! They have a beautiful angel voice that I could hear forever. You will never be disapointed when you buy any of their cd's!"
4,"Panel good, shipping not","The panels we ordered looked very nice but there was minor shipping damage to two panels. The company said the replacement parts for two panels would be $20. I notified UPS of the $20 worth of damage and they said they'd send someone out to check. The person picked up the panels and left. They returned them to Amazon as ""undeliverable"" so now we had no panels. We wound up buying 8 panels from another vendor."
3,Great product,"I bought this product a couple weeks ago and it is wonderful. I wish I had bout some more. The waist band feels great.But there is only one problem-- the pouch is rather small. Although the problem can be fixed with a little stretching, its not comfortable for the first couple of uses by men who are over 8"""
5,danner boots,"I purchased these boots for a friend and he said that I must submit this review. Per him, ""These boots were comfortable right out of the box. I worked 8 hours in the rain and was soaking wet and cold, but my feet were warm and dry. I highly recommend these boots."""
4,Brings history to life,I downloaded this on my way to Tripoli to cover the Revolutiom. What a thrill to read about the first US invasion while starimg at the harbor where it happened.
2,Fascinating story marred by amateurish writing,"While the history of a young America's naval adventures in the Mediterranean is clearly a fascinating one (and largely unknown, at least to me) it is done a terrible disservice by author Joshua E. London.As much respect as I have for what appears to be his painstaking research in pulling together the events and happenings of those days, and placing them in the proper historical context, the telling of the tale suffers from his pedestrian, high-school text book writing style of the sort in which ""this happened, then this happened, then this happened.""You need look no further for an example of the decline of the once-valued craft of book editing."
1,An Islamophobic twister,"As title implies this book is both Islamophobic and it's twisting history. Why does piracy shown as ""terrorism"" i am having hard time understanding this. Then why, for example ""Francis Drake"" is not called a terrorist. Or why not call Napoleon as terrorist? It's disgusting to see how hypocrite some people are when some violent attacks committed by Muslim they call it ""terrorism"" (i doubt if they even know the description of terrorism) but when same thing done by a European it's called ""heroism"". Either author is an Islamophobic or he takes advantage of the fact that there's a lot of hateful and stupid Christians who thinks Muslims are going to bomb their home and take over their lands."
5,"Wonderful book with a gripping, timely story...a great read.","I just finished reading this excellent volume of history...wow! The book has plenty of timely overtones and nuances to it, yet is totally free of explicit contemporary political views or commentary. The material seems totally fresh and genuinely informative, even though it is dealing with events that took place over two hundred years ago.The book is really well written, with all sorts of fascinating facets and characters. I thought I knew more about America's first encounter with the Arabs than I actually did, and I learned a great deal more about the North African pirates than I otherwise knew...and I know a heck of a lot about pirates. I mean PIRATES! ARRRRGH!""Victory in Tripoli"" is well worth picking up, and will prove hard to put down. :)"
5,An excellent drill,"This drill has everything going for it. The fit and finish are excellent. It has very little runout, and Campbell Hausfeld didn't scrimp on the chuck; it's a Jacobs. I love the compact size and contoured grip; this drill feels like an extension of my hand. It's very good for drilling in tight places.Here's a couple of tips...Like most air drills, this one doesn't have variable speed, so you need to be ready when you hit the trigger.For continuous or heavy use, It's a good idea to use an in-line or stationary oiler. And flood the drill with oil before you use it for the first time. I poured a teaspoon into the inlet as Campbell Hausfeld recommends."
4,Deal,Good quality look and work perfect. No way you could beat the price either. I recommend this product to anyone needing RCA's
4,"ok, but im getting tired of red ; my first review","i bought this item with Razer Diamondback salamander red mouse (which i don't recommend, get the copperhead) but, otherwise, its the best keyboard ive ever typed on, the wrist rest got kindove annoying. im giving this to one of my relatives and buying the Saitek eclipse II, or the G11 keyboard(which my friend has and i would reccomend that also)"
3,Needs Improvement,Pros:- Quiet and well balanced keys- Controlable Backlighting (Off + 2 levels)- Does not slide easily- StylishCons:- Special characters cannot be distinguished in the dark with backlighting on (have to lean over and close in to see them)- Num Lock and Caps Lock lights are way too bright relative to rest of keys(very annoying if you use Num Lock all the time)- Sound controls are not backlit- No media controls
1,"Shoddy product, utterly incompetent customer service","I bought one of these and was initially pleased. It was quiet and looked cool, although it's large size makes it impossible to fit in an ordinary keyboard tray. Unfortunately, after a few months of normal use, individual keys started dying. I've never had that happen with any keyboard before, in 24 years of computing. I opened a ticket on the Saitek/MadCatz customer support page. Absolutely no response for 3 weeks. That's right, three weeks. When they finally did respond, they did nothing except ask me for information plainly visible on the support ticket. That is the opposite of customer support. Use these products at your peril."
5,Great Keyboard,"Great keyboard, i bought this keyboard for gaming (i know its not usually gamers first pick) but im satisfied completely with it.I love the palm rest , the illuminated keys and the keyboards shape is pretty cool too."
5,Great addition to gaming rig!,"I bought this keyboard nearing on a year ago, and I still love it. I was going for a black silver and red motif for my new computer, and this fit in absolutely perfectly.The keys are smooth and quiet, and the red backlight however useless since I type by touch, gives the aesthetic appeal that I wanted! I also hate the average modern keyboards having piles of useless specialized buttons that I'll never use, so I'm a bit of a minimalist--but this keyboard is just perfect; the volume buttons in the top right corner are relatively useful, and are out of the way, so I don't mind them too much.The only gripe I have with this keyboard, is that the silver paint on the keys is starting to flake off a little bit. Otherwise, I am extremely pleased with this purchase!"
4,Almost perfect,"It looks really good in dim light. If you like your computer space brightly lit, you probably don't need this. I bought the one with blue lighting and it is hard to read some of the keys. Maybe I should have gotten red?"
5,Awesome gaming keyboard,"The Saitek Eclipse Backlit keyboard is awesome. Most of my gaming is done at night in a darkened room. I am not a touch typist, so having the keys light up is fantastic. I play Call of Duty 4 and my scores have doubled since I got the keyboard. The keys are soft and work well on none gaming functions as well. I've seen the blue-lit keyboard in action, and the red-lit keys are definitely the way to go."
3,Dont buy it!,"Im actually surprised this keyboard has gotten the reviews it has. Initially I thought ""wow this looks pretty cool."" and since Im a gamer and play in the dark from time to time I thought a lighted keyboard would be a nice change. WRONG!! The picture makes it look brighter than it actually is. Its barely illuminated at all.Additionally, Ive owned it for about 3 months now and the buttons are already fading. By fading I mean.... the silver paint they painted over the buttons with WEARS OFF!!!The wrist rest is okay, but really cheap and if you move your keyboard or adjust your station it falls off and is generally just a PoS.I would never recommend this keyboard to anyone."
2,"What a disaster, could have been so nice!","The idea of a backlit keyboard intrigued me. This one initially was great. It has a smooth touch. It is great to use in the dark. However, and this is a BIGGIE, the paint has totally worn off most of the keys and the backlight has gone out. The keys started wearing out after several weeks of use. Now a few months later, the paint is almost totally worn away on 27 of the keys, making them totally illegible. Good thing I am a touch typer. Today the light went out which prompted me to finally write a review. The keyboard now looks like junk. It still has a smooth touch but for the money, there should have been more testing done. The manufacturer and the store where I bought this were totally unresponsive to my complaints. I can't believe the good reviews this keyboard got. I am extremely disappointed."
3,Looks Great but not Perfect,"The keyboard looks as good as advertised - the red backlighting is great. Unfortunately the keys are mushy. I like to have a nice, smooth, defintive click when I press down. In this the keyboard falls short. The little feet in back that push the keyboard up at an angle are too short as well and I ended up using the wrist guard to help prop it up at a little steeper angle."
2,"Great keyboard, until it stops working.","The keyboard stopped working after a year of use. My friend also owned this keyboard and it broke after 6 months of use. When it breaks, the keys become unresponsive and/or the keyboard starts spamming a random key.The keyboard itself is wonderful when it works, but if it isn't going to work for long, why bother?"
4,"Not super bright, but a solid keyboard with some lighting","I have to agree with other reviews that state this keyboard is not very bright. It ain't, and if you need glasses in dim light the letters absolutely will not stand out. Still, it gives SOME lighting and I got it at a good discount price, so I ain't complaining too much. Better illuminated keyboards cost quite a bit more. Now, I'm mostly using it for business and typing, and it's got good touch feel to it (the downside is that there is clicking that folks can hear on the phone, so don't expect to pull one over on your girlfriends when talking with them and letting them think you're not on the computer!). The size is right, it has a full layout, it tilts fine. I don't use the included wrist rest, so I can't comment on that. Overall if you're OK with a somewhat lit keyboard, this is fine and I'd recommend it."
3,Had it for a year.,"I bought this keyboard because of the back lit keys. It was really a godsend being that I most often play games at night. But alas, it wasn't too long before I had to replace it.After about 6 months the (space bar key) started sticking in a depressed position. Yes, very sad indeed. It also got dirty easy being that there is a big gap between each key.I almost replaced it with the latest Cyborg V.7 but thought better of it and decided to give the Razor Lycosa a chance, and I am glad i did, but that is another review for another day.The Saitek Eclipse was a nice keyboard for its time, :b a long time ago. Its NOT a keyboard for gaming but that is what I used it for anyways."
2,Nice Backlight,"The backlight is good but as a keyboard and the design is really lacking so the comfort is not there, so probally not a good idea as a primary device, but just for gaming."
4,Good Keyboard,"Don't love it, don't hate it. It's a good keyboard, nothing I haven't experienced before with other boards. The manual is a joke, no real info. It's a good solid keyboard, not much more to say about it. Oh, the light up part. I guess some would like it...I can't type in the dark anyway."
3,Keyboard review,"This product is ok, but not what i was expecting. It lights the keyboard but the keys are not clear and crisp to see as i had hoped. I still need proper lighting to see the keyboard."
4,nice keyboard at a good price,"This keyboard is great and I'd give it the last star if it had a variable color keyboard led. I knew it didn't have that when I ordered it, so no blame to anyone else."
5,Love It!,"This keyboard is GREAT. Everything (and more) that I'd hoped it would be. The lighting in my office isn't the greatest so it's the answer to my problem. The price was fantastic and after my $25 reward certificate, I ended up paying $9.99 for it (no shipping charge). Can't beat that with a stick!"
3,lights up but still hard to see,red led works but glare from the silver keys still makes charicters difficult to see. would be a lot better if the paint was black instead of that lead color.
5,Sweet keyboard,The keyboard was delayed in shipping but goes with my black and red computer awesomely. I really haven't fully used it in the dark for hours or anything but on the first night test it was very helpful to have it lit up for the minor work. I really wish I could make it even BRIGHTER because it looks SO COOL.Not to sound too much like a kid in the candy store or from the 90's but it is awesome. Definitely buy it if you are thinking of it.
2,Bad spacebar,"You have to hit the spacebar dead in the center or it will not work. The keys are mushy and you have to be exactly on top of them for the light to show through the entire letter. I am returning this keyboard, only it doesn't show up on the items I can return. Emailed customer service on that. I have a Saitek Eclipse II and that keyboard has none of the problems listed above."
5,"great keyboard, but has 1 flaw","i just got this keyboard and i love it. its a great keyboard but i have one problem with it. the problem is the lighting. if you are looking at the keys from an angle, you may only see half of the key lit up. this can make it difficult to tell what the key is, due to only half of it being lighted. you wont have this problem though if you are looking at it directly top down, only when looking at the keys on an angle. its not a major problem though, as you can still make out most of the keys. the only time it is a big problem is with the numpad and keys that have more than one letter on them, like say the insert key. you probably wont use those keys a lot anyway so its not that big a deal.all and all, its a great keyboard if you can get past that one flaw."
3,WARNING: SAME book as Aha! Aha! Insight,"The 3 stars is NOT about the content of the book - it's because of the following:The following two books are 100% IDENTICAL:""Aha! Insight by Gardner, Martin"". ISBN: 071671017X&""Aha! Aha! Insight by Gardner, Martin"". ISBN: 0894540017Don't be fooled by the different ISBN's - the covers are identical and flipping through both books, the pages are identical.As for the book itself, I haven't had a chance yet to read it - I'm still trying to straighten out all the duplicates I have."
4,This is a good ''Math book'' by:Allen,"This a very good book !! I can't explain why but it is just to wonderful. This book dose not only tell us about math . it also tell us about launange , logic , and many many other thing . You can read it when your bored or on the trip to vacation or , you can ask your friend the question in the book , and see if they can answer it wright? However , this book is program for some one who like math , launange , logic . So if you like these object you might like to read this great great book!!!!"
3,Celestron Omni series 1-1/4 12MM Eyepiece.,"I feel that this eyepiece is quite functional, but I feel that it doesn't have as good of viewing quality as an orthoscopic eyepiece that I have with the same focal length."
2,Lack of detail,"Looking to obtain more depth in this subject, I purchased this book only to find that it lacks sufficient detail and at times fabricates details (i.e. Esther is portrayed as rather weak and timid verses the courageous women we know her to have been). It is easy to read but lacks depth to capture interest."
4,Planet Drum - the heartbeat of our world,"A celebration of Percussion & Rhythm. Origin Stories & original paintings of drummers, singers, dancers, clappers & all manner of rhythmic instruments from the four corners of the world & distant times, illuminate this passionate, enchanting tour. There is a tape that accompanies the reading of this lovely book."
4,Hilarious Bill Pollack Stories,"This is a delightful and rollicking tale of the cars and people that enlivened Southern California's sports-car-racing scene in the 1950s. Bill Pollack was clearly a very capable driver in his day, although he tends to downplay this in the telling. His personality profiles and anecdotes are a pleasure page after page.I'd have given this book five stars if it didn't have so many typos amd misspellings of the names of well-known people and cars. A knowledgeable editor would have been useful.Well done, Bill, and thanks for your recollections and stories. Some of them may even be true!"
3,Mitnick Rules!,"Indeed, this book is a must read for all students of Mill and Hart. When USA , the so-called defenders of libertarianism, mercilessly stalked a brilliant, if immature computer genius and ruthlessly plotted his downfall...all the world was a mute spectator. In effect, Mitnick was but a scapegoat who was used to write off the lax security on US Govt databases...."
1,"This guy is the devil, and I am scared of him;","Don't spend your money on junk, goto 2600.com and buy ""freedom downtime"", if you want to have any idea what your talking when it comes to mitnick or anything about our facist goverments wrecklessness. peace"
3,"tedious, self-indulgent subplots,","Tedious, self-indulgent subplots. I dont care about Julia. No one cares about Julia. No one cares about where you eat or where you rent a car. These subplots REALLY screw-up the read. But the computer stuff is interesting enough. But somebody, please, toss Julia overboard."
1,This was horrible literature,"I don't know why they bothered publishing this book. Tsutomu is obviously a self-absorbed, i think i'm better than everyone, snub nosed jerkoff. He's got a lot of nerve acting the way he did to everyone...He ought to find a hole and stick with what he knows...himself."
1,This books is pure unadulterated garbage!,"Kevin Mtnick was not as bad as this guy Tsutomu Shimomura makes him out to be. Tsutomu Shimomura wants everyone to think Mitnick is so bad and dangerous just so he can feel like a hero. My guess all the stuff in this book are over exaggerated to benefitShimomura. I do not recommend this book, but if you are interested in researching this story there are alot of more unbiased books out there just do a google or amazon search you'll find plenty."
1,waste of money,This is the worst book I ever read. A two year old WOULD have done a better job writing it. The author has no idea what he is talking about. What a waste. I would have a better time reading the side of an easy cheese can.
5,Great book!,I am sorry that I almost missed this out of print book (I finally managed to buy it from Amazon marketplace) because I took in regard the opinion of some reviewers.Christos Karayiannis
1,A pile of monkeycrap,"There are many lies told about computer hackers, and the ones told in this book are among the worst. The reason? There is money and reputations to be made; it is as simple as that. Don't even bother picking this thing up, because you are feeding the exploitation of poor Mr. Mitnick.Buy Fugitive Game instead, and free Kevin."
2,an interesting story--may I never have to meet the author,"An interesting story of how Mitnick was tracked down. Too bad it's encumbered by Shimomura's self-admiration. I suppose that they wanted to include something about the author's life, a la Clifford Stoll's __The Cuckoo's Egg__--but Stoll is a person with whom one can sympathize, totally unlike Shimomura."
2,Annoying ....,"This book could have been condensed into 100 pages. All of the references to his girlfriend Julia were extremely annoying and could have easily been left out. The food references reminded me of ""The Cuckoo's Egg"". To all the people that helped Tsutomu catch Kevin, you should feel insulted by what he writes. Apparently, he believes that you are a bunch of idiots.To balance this perspective, the book does describe some of the intrusions in detail. The IP spoofing section was especially interesting (if you geek off of technical details.)To summarize, just look through the index and pick out the topics that interest you. The rest is just fluff."
1,I can't beleive this was classified as Non-Fiction,"This book is pure crap, plain and simple. I've read the screenplay for the movie and it's even worse. Please, for the love of God, do not read anything by these two losers."
1,"My God, What a load of....","This book was painful to read. It is poorly written drivel. If you are truly interested in the topic, there are much better books written on Mitnick, Hacking/Phreaking, and/or computer security issues. With every paragraph that Shimomura writes about his love life (and there are plenty of them,) the book, (although calling it that is insulting to other books) continues on a long downward spiral into the absolute load of poop that it is. I feel sorry that paper was wasted to create this mess. I cannot believe I wasted several hours of my life reading this."
1,reply to Jamie Andrews,"I'm astonished that you can conclude that negative reviews of this book must be from pro-cracking, 2600 reading adolescents. Whether or not one is a cracker does not mean that the story isn't sidetracked by Shimomura's immense ego. I don't believe Markoff exaggerated to make the story more interesting; after all, he is essentially reporting the facts as relayed to him by Shimomura. Reading the book ""Cyberpunk"", which was 1/3 devoted to Kevin Mitnick, makes me realize that Markoff (and his co-writer in that endeavor) is capable of telling a story without the excesses found in ""Takedown."""
3,"Whats for dinner tonight, Tsutomu?","The story is interesting and intriguing for the most part. Shimomura/Markoff do a very good job at explaining the technical actions taking place and they are easily understandable for the non-techie. But... some advice: as soon as you read about what they are eating or the name ""Julia"" comes up, go ahead and skip three or four pages and save yourself some time. These topics have no bearing in the story whatsoever and they only distract you from the plot."
1,Quite poor,"I can't blame Tsutomo Shimomura for writing page after page of uninteresting and unrelated narrative in this ""thriller,"" but I can blame the publishers for leaving it in. Most of the book proceeds in a plodding, second-by-second account of Shimomura's life during his pursuit of Mitnick. This might have been a good formula if either (a) - Shimomura's life were interesting (it isn't), or (b) - he was skilled enough to make it seem interesting (he isn't).The book actually manages to build some excitement as authorities begin to close in, but the conclusion of Mitnick's take-down is a let-down.By the way, did John Markoff read this book before he allowed his name to be included as co-author? It doesn't even seem like anyone edited it."
1,"Please, Amazon, consider a zero star rating!","Every couple of pages I had to open the book to the back cover and whack the picture of Shimomura with my fingernail. This man's ego is so immense that it taints every facet of the story. He wants the reader to think he is incredibly cool by sharing pointless and unintersting details about his personal life. Is he smart? You would think so, considering his track record. But the reality is that he is quite stupid to think that writing an homage to himself wouldn't be received with contempt by most open-minded readers. This book is simple to describe: Shimomura is a genius with an enviable lifestyle, and everyone else is so stupid they might as well give up and stay the hell out of his way. Tsutomu, a Samurai? May I suggest you fall on your sword?"
1,No autobiography pending...,"The tracking and capture of Kevin Mitnick could have been summarized in one, maybe two chapters. Instead, Shimomura wrote a very disorganized autobiography with an occasional paragraph about the tracking/capture of Kevin Mitnick. I'm guessing the editors knew this, but opted for a novel, instead of a magazine article.Don't let the title fool you - the author was simply a self-involved victim that became part of the group that captured Mitnick, this time. Mitnick has been caught a few times before, without the author's help.Tsutomo - I don't doubt that you are a highly skilled programmer, but there are undoubtedly better ones in the world. Keep that in mind when you deal with your friends and coworkers. If you truly have the attitude you show in your novel, I can't imagine why you still have any friends."
1,Smells like fiction,"Had this book been fictional, it would have been enjoyable, if a little simpleminded and predictable. But to see this book portrayed as nonfiction, as the true story of a motley group of rough-around-the-edges but idealistic white-hat computer experts, seems like wishful thinking. The consistent idiot portrayals of FBI and other law enforcement personnel, coupled with the consistent genius of the authors, left me rolling my eyes.It's very distracting to the reader that the entire story reads like propaganda in favor of the principal authors, whipping up an exciting chase more to stir up emotions (and perhaps a movie deal). Maybe in future years there will be a little more skepticism on the part of the public and we'll all realize that the good guys aren't all that spotless, and the bad guys were never really as bad as they were made out to be."
2,"Read ""Fugitive Game"" first.","I read ""Fugitive Game"" first and I think it is a better look at Kevin Mitnick and the things he did. Tsutomu Shimomura spent way too much time his personal life and far too little on the real technical insight he could have provided. I was pretty disappointed.There are some interesting tidbits, so if you are really looking to dig deep for a couple of nuggets, they are in there. But the writing style makes this book seem really long."
2,"Some Good technical details, poorly written.","This title is not as bad as most people would have you believe. The story is engaging enough, and I am a sucker for any Mitnick material, but it what it lacks is humility. Both The Fugitive Game and The Samuri and The Super Hacker are better books on the same subject, so read those if you want an unbiased account. Tsutomo tries to be ""Cliff Stole"", but lacks something very important...humility. Too much of the book is wasted on his boring love life and his off-hand remarks about how much better or smarter than everyone else he is. That very well may be true, but it makes for some very tedious page turning. On the bright side, the book contains the best layman's description of IP spoofing I have read. All in all, it is an ok read if you can't get your hands on any of the other books on the subject, or have read everything and want the final, biased account."
1,If it was true then it would be great,"The book has too many exagerations, as well as fallacies. Sure, he tracked Kevin down. But he gives himself too much credit. Not to mention the fact that Kevin has been in jail for more than three years without a trial.. wheres the Justice .. If you want to here an UNBIASED basis of the story read 'The Fugitive Game' by Jonathan Littman. That tells the story as is.. not a one-sided FBI story.."
1,13 pages in and i already don't care about this guy,"got from library, not sure i can go oni'm agnostic on mitnick, thought it might be an interesting storybut already i can see this guy shimomura is an egomaniac; how did markoff let this go out under his name? well then again he writes for the ny slimesskiing, what he eats, his girlfriend, his cabin, his outfit, comparing himself to Feynman, irrelevant asides about the Donner party, and like i said that's just 13 pages in! yucki came to this section to see what is being said, reviews confirm my takecompared to Katie Hafner's Wizards (admittedly a different topic, but nonetheless a book about computer world) which i just finished, this is horrible"
2,good story overshadowed by author's irritating ego,i read this book because i was interested in the topic of internet security. the story is interesting and suspenseful. worth the read. i was displeased by the very egocentric narration by the the author. his opinions and comments on non-internet security related matters are found to be obnoxious at best.
2,"An interesting, but laughable, read.","The book was interesting (from a technical perspective), and was hard to put down in spots (hence, the better than one star rating). Nonetheless, Shimomura is so full of himself (to wit, if you believe the book, he *never* makes a mistake, while those around him bungle things up constantly) that the book is laughable. I haven't read the other books that other reviews cite, but I can't imagine they'd be any worse than this one."
2,"Buy ""The Fugitive Game : Online With Kevin Mitnick"" instead",This book had potential but so much of it is about Tsutomu's dysfunctional personal life that it wrecks whatever interesting technical material there is. I have the distinct impression that Tsutomu and Mitnick have A LOT more in common than Tsutomu would like us to believe.
4,A good book on catching a hacker,"Arrogant people contribute to our knowledge, too. Tsutomu's book shows how a person's inability to sympathize with others who don't have a particular technical background will cause missed opportunities. The bad guy is caught in the end, and Tsutomu is largely responcible, but how much faster could the hacker have been caught? A diary would be a failure if it only recorded the good and ignored the bad; if it only recorded the positive sides of the author and covered up the unsightly sides of everyone involved. Tsutomu's book should be on everyone's list to read!"
1,"Horrible, horrible book","Finally I read this book. I'm a fan of John Markoff's reporting, but this book is a really huge disappointment. I don't know if it's Markoff's or Shimomura's fault. Let's assume it's Shimomura's, since he, indeed, has a real big bad ego, which wouldn't have been egregious had he not put down everybody in the book, including Kevin Mitnik as well as Shimomura's hardworking grad student Andrew Gross.Most of the account in the book is devoted to his relationship with this white woman as well as where he and his friends (whom he almost always despises) would eat. A lot of confusing digressions make the book difficult to follow at times. And there are numerious technical inaccuracies; e.g., ""The Usenet...predates the Internet by a few years."" Hello!?"
1,It sucked.,"This book was written by two losers who took a good, but not dangerous, hacker down. Markoff was in it because his ego is as inflated as a balloon in the Macy's Parade. Shimomura had reasons, but who knows what they were. He is no doubt some type of government goon, no matter how smart he is. Furthermore, he is probably a more dangerous hacker than Mitnick, namely because he has government approval to do whatever he wants. Markoff and Shimomura can shove it."
2,A 20th Century Penny Dreadful,"Hacking is an industry, not just for security experts of various kinds, but for the media as well. Hackers are the modern-day equivalent of the gunslingers of the American frontier, exploited by the media and misunderstood by a public fascinated by them. The picture of Mitnick presented by Shimomura and Markoff is no better then an account of Billy the Kid in a 19th century penny dreadful.Don't purchase this book without picking up Jonathan Littman's excellent Fugitive Game. There are two stories to every side, and the Kevin Mitnick saga is no exception. Littman presents a much more complex and problematic account of Mitnick's exploits and the media circus that has surrounded him."
1,Warning; egomaniac who exaggerates.,"I've read every book and most articles about Kevin Mitnick. I think this book is grossly exaggerated, but not only that; I felt the authors are so into feeding their own ego that they forgot to worry about writing a good book that people might actually enjoy. One star. borrring. self obsessed. Can't believe I suffered through the pages."
1,Wrong Story to read.,"This book contains wrong information of the great Kevin Mitnick. I heard that there is a movie coming out. If you wish to read a good and true book about him, read The Fugitive Game."
1,Markoff and Shimomura tell a tale,This book if pure fiction and its only purpose is to promote Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff..if you want a non-fiction book..look elseware.
1,Self-Aggrandizing Authors Spoil a Good Story,"This book is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff have everything to gain by making Kevin Mitnick appear to be the embodiment of all known evil on the Internet. Markov sells more books and Shimomura vastly improves his consulting rates.The authors do *not* make a convincing case that Mitnick has performed heinous crimes. Meanwhile, we (the readers) have to wade through pointless chapters on Shimomura's hot tub and skiing excursions. A fair warning...Chapter 4 can cause internal hemorrhaging...this guy has an *ego*!On a happier note, Jonathan Littman's book: ""The Fugitive Game"" is a much more balanced treatment and leaves you wondering...""Now, why is Mitnick rotting in jail?"""
1,Guaranteed to make you sleep.,"The pursuit and capture of Kevin Mitnick is fascinating, however, Mr. Shimomura is not a skilled writer and makes this exciting story, a slow and painful read. The first couple of chapters barely even discuss Mr. Mitnick. Instead, Mr. Shimomura describes in full detail his ski trips and nights in the hottub with Julia Menapace, his friend's girlfriend.Also, it's not pleasant to follow the ins and outs of a man who constantly finds fault with everyone. He seems to view everyone as incompetent -- the FBI, the phone company, his assistant, Kevin Mitnick. Apparently, he only sees himself as one worthy of any kind of praise in this book."
3,Basically a computer crowd beach book.,"An arrogant, snotty, spoiled, egotistical college kid tells how he spent his winter break trying to find out who broke into his computer and thus missed a ski trip in Tahoe. There's some irrevalant episodes of adolesenct puppy love thrown in for some reason. It's basically a beach book for the computer crowd. Read it over a three day weekend and then toss it."
4,Chase For Hacker Or Food?,"To be versed in the Mitnick saga, you must read Shimomura's book as well as Littman's ""The Fugitive Game."" You come away with the feeling that Shimomura must carry pictures of himself in his wallet because he loves himself so much. And why the endless prattle about food and where they would eat next? Was it a stakeout or a trip to the Mickey D drive thru? Make no mistake, ""Takedown"" has the point of view of the hunter, but its inside view of the hunt for Mitnick is fascinating and hard to put down once you get past the self-loving chapters."
2,Waste of Time,"This book is a hardcore waste of time to read. I bought this book with the intentions of reading an edge-of-your-seat hacker thriller (mostly because Kevin Mitnick was and still is a genius, and his story is phenominal). This book disappointed me so much. If you want a good hacker thriller read The Hacker Crackdown, or even Hackers: Heroes of the Online Revolution. Those are excellent books about the real life and times of some of the most nefarious hackers of our day."
2,PLEASE Read The Fugitive Game after you read this book!,This book is pretty boring. The pages and pages of details about Tsumoto's life really get to you after awhile. His arrogance is only matched by his determination that we the reader not think of him as a computer nerd. If you have the stamina read this book then read The Fugitive Game for a more accurate story and so much more interesting.
2,Egotistical Hero: Blech!,"Nothing worse that a egotistical hero telling his side of the story. At times, the chase is exciting, but for the non-technical readers, it contains too many geeky references to keep their attention"
1,How a guy like this one could ever have a girlfriend?,"Shimomura is so obnoxius that the most impressive fact along the entire book is: how a woman can tolerate a guy like him? Take my guess, buy The Fugitive Game, and don't take the risk to get your brain in a lethargic state... permanently."
1,Terrible,"Agreed. This book was the worst one written. To get to the story, you have to read through the authors autobiography, which is extremely boring in itself. Do not buy this book."
5,Hope in the midst of tragedy!,"Gregory Clapper was an Air National Guard chaplain in Iowa when United Airlines flight 232 crashed. Over one-hundred people. Clapper ministered to the families of the victims, those who survived, and even members of the various National Guard and governmental agencies involved in sifting the wreckage.His book is not a thrill-seeking story. It is a thoughtful spiritual reflection on the crash. Clapper examines small interactions and relationships . In these reflections Clapper offers six resources for living with tragedy, something which we cannot escape. His resources range from embracing the essential mystery of life to releasing the tears to living with hope. This evocative book brings forth tears and joy and a sense of God's reign in the midst of imperfection.Considering the numbers of tragic events (e.g., ethnic cleansing, high school and grade school shootings, natural disasters), this engrossing book is a must read."
4,Beautiful but coy,"Elegantly photographed, these obviously staged photographs are a big tease: yes, the publisher and team make clear that one shouldn't expect much by way of explicit images, and nothing that is more than R-rated. But the constant play with the homoerotic is cloying after a while: macho camaraderie is one thing, for an athlete. What appear to be poses struck for the sake of a presumed gay readership is somehow condescending after a while. Even so, the photographs are beautifully lit and framed, the men are beautiful and just real enough (though ""unstaged""? please. in the video we see the makeup being applied!), and the production standards are superlative."
3,"Gorgeous, but disapoints","An absolutely beautiful production, this book is physically larger than expected, featuring excellent high quality printing and heavy coated stock. The varnished dust jacket is outstanding. BUT, I question the statement ""candid"", all shots are obviously staged. What little text there is refers to the men being unshaved, and not ""prettified- but believe me, there are plenty of shaved men in here! Be aware there are over twenty pages of ""filler shots"", yes the 15 plus head shots are great, but the title of the book is not ""Locker Room Head Shots""...I also question the empty room shots (especially on double truck spread) a major waste of space. Still all in all, though a book still worth buying- be sure yours has that dust jacket! I am eager to see and compare the French original edition."
5,Charming and beautifully done,"A great slice of Americana, this book is wonderful for parents and grandparents alike. The songs are easily arranged for singing and/or playing and the watercolor illustrations are sweet. And for those of us who can only remember the first verse or chorus of old favorites, this book prints all the verses! Enjoy!"
5,Great.,"I thought it was a great book. It was my first ever read of Maya Angelou. I think the book has made me a fan of her. Her style of writing was mellifluous, sincere, and truthful.I am not a very emotional person, but the part that made my eyes water was when Maya went to the market in Kato, as the book ended. She met Ewe women who instantly confused her for an Ewe. They were sure Maya was an Ewe decendant because of her features and tone of voice. Once, she was mistaken for a Bambara, and an Ahanta as well. It was beautiful. I admire Maya for her having fortitude and being curious and passionate. She loves her people and was more than willing to come back home to America to help them by working for Malcolm X, promoting civil rights, et al. I have great respect for her. She also learnt how to speak the Fanti language, which I would guess was not easy.It was a great autobiography. I wonder what would have happened if she had married the Malian Fulfulde man."
4,Maya Angelou's All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes,"With great detail, Maya Angelou describes the journeys of her life with her son. She shares her emotions with such strong words you feel like you are right there with her as she is telling her tale. From sorrow, to pity, to happiness, and all the way back through again, Maya Angelou tells a story of hope and dignity...how she survived life with a little faith in god and in family.I recommend this to book to anyone who is in need of a little hope or needs to get in touch with their inner self. This book is touching and uplifting. Give it a try, I know you'll love it as much as me, if not more!"
3,More for Children,"I am a big fan of Diana Wynne Jones books, I enjoy reading them even as an adult. Witch's Business however, is more for young readers than older ones. It's about two young siblings trying to make money and instead end up in trouble all over the place. They run around trying to help everyone do odd jobs finding lost items and getting into trouble with a nasty old witch. If you have a young child, read it to them otherwise you might want to skip this one."
3,stiff,"Compared to similar cord, this product is stiffer and takes knots less well.It is plenty strong and resists cuts as expected.The price is higher than it should be."
5,So Much Better!,"I love rope. Camping, rappelling, canoeing; I use it all the time. Sure, I've got expensive 10mm rope and the usual hardware store varieties. But what do you use for an important job that requires smaller diameter rope? I purchased the 5mm cord for a canoe tie down project. I opened the promptly delivered package and immediately realized that this was far superior to what you'd find on your local shopping aisle. The kernmantle braid is beautiful with no discernible flex. Very static. It is fairly stiff but typical of high quality kernmantle. With my canoe tie downs, I trust it 100%. Using it to rappel in a pinch.....probably 99%. Very pleased."
4,Solid cordelette,"I've been using this for rock climbing anchors for several months. It's a little less flexible than other cord, but solid and durable."
5,Excellent product.,"This purchase was made so I could make a gift of a purcell prusik for my son, went well and had enough left to make another prusik for his harness. We use them when working on a tower and find them very useful. Excellent shipping, escepially since we were in the backcountry of New Mexico."
2,Color not what was expected,In the picture the embroidery looks pink and blue; it turned out to be orange and turquoise. This is not what I wanted so I returned it.
5,for all the ones who buy in the future,"The item does not have a full ring to it, so it is adjustable. The item comes built so tight that the prices barely move. This is ok. Let me reassure you, the prices can be coaxed to move if you slowly flex them. This is done so the wearer can adjust the ring to the desired flexibility. The ring part that is supposed to mold around the fingertip is also adjustable and can be adjusted by hand. First rate and you should know, very heavy."
2,Disappointing,"Ordered this one along with another, and this was the more sturdy of the two. The other broke withing 10 minutes of opening the package. This one is still fine, but I'm shelving both. This one is very uncomfortable, and does not bend easily."
2,Failure and disappointment,"I decided that I wanted something that would go well with my personality, so I decided I would buy one of these and try it out. When I received it, I was amazed. The craftsmanship and overall design were beautiful, and I thought that this would be it. The one thing to bring my chaotic nature to the forefront. With about two months, either the hinges or the hinge holes had broken completely leaving only the base and finger piece intake to a usable point. Then to make matters worse, the base has a slowly evolving crack in it, making adjustment to size impossible with out completely breaking it to pieces. and the fingertip is also beginning to develop a crack in it.Overall, while being initially impressed by the craftsmanship and design, this was an overall fail. I am sorely disappointed in this product and will not be buying and of Dan's Jewelers other products. This is a disappointment and, to be honest, an embarrassment."
1,crap,"this was complete and total crap. i've never been so disappointed in a purchase in my life. i would've rather recieved flaming dung than this. it was bad quality, would only fit on the finger of a fat giant, and didn't even bend properly. if u buy it, you're a complete fool."
1,Baraka: A Visual Journal,A rather disappointing book with poor quality photos. If you like the movie stay away from this book!
4,its alright.,"i would understand why a number of people would find this DVD dull,its not extremely entertaining and on occasion in the format of an average documentary.however after following the cky crew my whole life i did still enjoy the simple antics of Dunn, Vito, and Dico.i would recommend the original CKY videos to start off with to those whom are not current followers of the crew, and build up to have enough familiarity to enjoy this just for the sheer following.i did enjoy this video."
1,poor editing and copywriting,"This book is a good story. It is innovative. But it contains far too many errors in research to be enjoyable (poor editing) and the typos and word substitutions make it difficult to read (poor copywriting). I would not buy it unless I knew nothing about history, geography, physics, grammar, etc. or if I just didn't care about all that reality stuff and only wanted a good story."
2,Disjointed,"A not very seamless adventure novel, each paragraph felt like I was reading another somewhat related short story."
4,An Original Adventure,"Damsel in the Rough was one of the most original adventure books I've read in a long time. Tasha, the heroine, seems like a normal Brooklyn college student at the beginning. But soon she is having encounters with gods and goddesses--and is in ancient Greece, herself! As the book winds along, Tasha rises to meet challenge after challenge; and she meets various friends and foes along the way as she has one breath-taking adventure after another. The only complaint I had was that once it was over, I felt the story cried out for an immediate sequel!"
5,Great Fun!,"I am a homeschooling mother of two and is constantly looking for educational material. This is a great book, the illustrations are funny and kids love the humorous bits and pieces. The information is presented in a very effective manner. I started my children very early on with music theory and can honestly say that all the books in the series serves as a great introduction to this field especially for younger children (age 4 onward)"
5,Buy this CD above their others......,"It is way better than ART DAMAGE.It does take time to get use to, however, this is a gem. If your the kind of person who feels the music sooo much that you scream a long to the music....this is one of those CDs. NOT THAT this is a sing a long CD necessarily. Lisen. Enjoy."
5,"Loud, Fast, Entertaining.","This band is energetic, fun, and in your face. It doesn't beat around the bush much at all. They have the signature play-on-word song titles, but their songs are hard and emotional. Songs have a lot more variation than sometimes they're credited for, and they have a very original, complex, and thought - provoking sound. If it's their harsh screaming, intensely technical guitars, pounding drums, or driving bass, FBTMOF never ceases to let up. I can't really compare this band to many others... but buy it if you like Norma Jean, older Underoath..."
3,Just alright,"I had never heard these guys before but I had heard good things from friends and internet reviews. I have to say I was a little disappointed, now thats not saying it was bad just not what i wanted from it. It won't be frequenting my cd player."
2,ok...,"Word to the people, don't buy stuff from word of mouth. Download a song or two first.Annoying vocals and stupid guitars, what more could i ask for! 2 stars because they have lots of energy live and they played with the ""Red Chord"" for some strange reason..."
5,recipient very happy,"I ordered these fruit bowls as a thank you gift from our yellow lab dog, Harry, for our friends who babysat him for 11 days while we went on a cruise. My friend had 8 bowls already and mentioned that she wished she had bought 12 because she has a big family. They were hard to find. Macy's did not have them or any way to order them. So I went online and found them through Amazon. My friend is very happy to get them and says they are in perfect condition. Needless to say, Harry is invited back any time!"
1,Don't buy this,"The valve looked good and installation was easy. But it wouldn't turn the water completely off. After checking my installation a couple of times, I compared the new valve to the old one. The stem length was 2mm off.Mixet is an obsolete system and the after market parts aren't reliable. The only sure fix for worn out Mixet valves is to replace them with standard valves. A solution which may be beyond a DIY project form many homeowners."
3,Nice material but has design issues,"The case is made of nice material, but I was disappointed with the way that the handheld binds to the case and how the case closes. The mechanism to bind the handheld to the case is a piece of Velcro that permanently sticks to the back of the handheld; the Tungsten C (and other models) has a nice rail mechanism designed to insert/remove covers, so I was disappointed this ""executive"" case did not use the rail (as the Tungsten C Slim Leather Case does). The case also stays closed by the use of a magnet sewn inside the cover that is positioned directly above the handheld. I suppose that magnets don't bother modern electronics or credit cards that the case is also designed to store?? In any case (no pun intended) this just bothered me."
3,Farberware 3 qt saucepan,"The concept of this pan is nice - a basic stainless pan for all around cooking. The nice features are the spout and drain holes in the lid which enable you to drain off liquids, without dirtying another colander, or risking losing your contents down the sink. Perfect for making mashed potatoes, and cooking vegetables. It's also nice to find a pan without a glass lid, which seems to be the standard nowadays; and the lid handle doesn't get hot like on so many brands. On the negative side, the pan seems a little light and thin compared to the stainless that I've been using for 40 years. Seems like it would dent easily. The worst part is that the lid does not fit perfectly and is something I will constantly have to fiddle with. I'm considering sending it back."
3,A Hobbled classic,"Having eaten all the teflon off the bottom of my main saucepan I was excited to get this classic pot with a nice, stainless material. Every time I look at it I think of my grandmother's house. However, I've run into 2 problems with it:1- the lid doesn't fit on perfectly. I believe the pan isn't perfectly round. I exchanged it when i realized this and the second had the same problem.2- It doesn't form a seal, so if you are cooking something like rice where liquid levels are very sensitive it might not work out for you.That said if it reminds you of your grandmother's house or you just want a decent quality classic pot I say go for it."
5,The Classic 3 qt. Straining Saucepan.,"Not much I can say about a ""classic"". It heats quickly, handle is comfortable to grip when its full and performs its basic intention flawlessly. If you've ever struggled draining macaroni from a regular saucepan or simply don't want to use a big clumsy colander then this is the solution. I've been using mine for two years now and highly recommend it as a cooking necessity."
2,Farberward Classic 3 Quart Covered Straining Saucepan,The lid on this pot does not fit tightly and it would let steam out of the vented holes while cooking.
3,Farberware,I was disappointed in the quality of this product. The pot is very light and flimsy. All of my other Farberware stainless steel pots are sturdy. I am waiting to see whether this one is durable.
1,v710 alone provides better call quality than HF600,"You're probably better off with just a car adapter to power the phone and a technique to attach the phone to the dash so that it doesn't roll around on something like a car seat. The v710 provides best speakerphone quality to both ends if used alone.I also tried to control the speaker volume from the phone (there's nothing on the speaker unit to do that), and wasn't satisfied."
3,"Bands are fine, clip is a problem","I bought this kit because I liked the idea of the clip for adjusting length. Unfortunately, the clip does not work on the thickest band and is difficult on the medium band. The lightweight band clamps with no problem. The bands are versatile though, and once I gave up on the clip I was happy enough with my purchase."
2,Interesting but a physically painful Journey to 7th Dan.,"Stan's journey to 7th Dan Ranking of the JKA is indeed a commendable feat considering the amount of time and effort he put in. However throughout his journey and his encounters with the 'Masters', he never seemed at peace with himself. Had he incorporated a daily and disciplined routine of meditation with his gruelling physical training, I am sure his journey would be a true experience of meditation in motion. Nevertheless I am certainly inspired and motivated by his sharing. The style of writing though could have been much more graceful, flowing and transcending with better use of the English Language."
3,"A good idea/thought, but already been done better","There have been a great many books written about martial arts. Some are technical manuals, a growing number are ""philosophical dribble"". Thankfully, Stan Schmidts work is neither of these. Auto-biography, is an intriguing peek, a voyeristic insight into the life of its author. Yet in this work, the life's story presented seems disjointed in critical junctures. These presentation are a bad distraction from the basic message, whatever it was intended to be. Half its size, this book would be as honed as it's authors renowned physical techniques.... Maybe next time round."
5,Definitely worth the wait!,"I've been waiting months for this CD to be released, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait! I discovered Adam on www.myspace.com a few month ago and loved the songs he had posted. Adam Richman's ""Patience & Science"" falls into the power pop/punk genre except there's a lot more to it than that. The songs are well written, every song on the record could be heard on the radio, the hooks are amazing, and the production is great. When I read that Adam produced and mixed the record himself I was amazed that a 22 year-old could produce a major label sounding release!So, do youself a favor and buy this record!"
5,pun... i mean power pop's not dead.,"it seems like a lot of people are calling adam richman a punk because of his hair. well whatever, this isn't very punk to my ears. instead what you get is a great power pop record on par with the later output of punk pioneers like husker du and the replacements. and isn't it great when the punks slow down and write some great songs? they all have an edge to them, so i guess that's pretty punk. LOL. oh well, this guy rocks and he has a great voice to carry out those lyrics he's wearing on his sleeve. i hope ""maryanne"" gets on the radio, it's such a good summer shout-along and who doesn't want one of those for trips to the beach?!"
5,POP ROCKS,"every song on this album is catchy but more importantly - the tracks flow so naturally into one another that the entire album will have played and i am left wanting more! elements of rock, pop, quick-tempo & slow songs are all included - each connected with the thread of candid lyrics & contagious hooks. adam richman initially won me over with Mary-Anne & Baby, I've Changed .. but now I LOVE LOVE LOVE what can make you mine .. those are just my highlights.. a great album indeed - AR is HOT"
4,Los mejores,"Well, my dad is the one that listens most to los temerarios, but I got to say que la cancion de ""Ya Me Voy Para Siempre"" es la mejor que pudieron haber hecho."
1,non working cd player,"After reading the positive reviews, we purchased the Sony CMTBX1 system the last week of March. However, much to our disappointment, less than a month later the CD player stopped working. After inserting a CD, the system makes a clicking noise, the display indicates that it is trying to read the CD, and then a minute or so later the display reads No Disc. The CDs all play fine in other CD players. Cannot in good faith recommend this system"
4,"Nice styling, easy to use, Decent sound","I choose this unit to replace an existing compact audio system for my living room. I liked the styling and the ability to virtually hide it amoungst a set of books on the shelf. The controls on top of the unit are a little hard to read and caused me to move the shelf down a little. As expected at this price point the speakers were sacrificed. I connected my existing speakers from my former system and the sound improved. If you are looking for an audiophile system I do not recommend this, but if it is a stylish, easy to use and simply ok sounding system for background music, give this a look. The price is right."
1,"This is garbage, CD player quit working","The CD player quit working after maybe 20 hours of use. According to the Sony customer service center I'll need to ship it to the Sony repair center in Laredo TX to have it fixed under warranty. I had expected better quality from Sony, but apparently they're now producing the same disposable crap as the cheaper brands."
2,Very poor sound quality,"Product works as advertised...plays cd's, am/fm radio works ok, but it sounds terrible. Has a hollow, lifeless sound that can't be fixed using the very limited EQ. It's ok for listening to talk radio, but if you want to listen to music with any life, bass/treble, depth, etc. then this thing should fall right off your short list. I know I can't expect a lot for $100.00, but this is bad."
1,Stay away!,"What a great way to ruin Christmas! I purchased this for my mom to use as a bookshelf system. I hooked it up, plugged it in and...nothing. It turned on, then turned right back off. Nothing could make it work. I went to Best Buy the next day and bought another (non-Sony) system. To Amazon's credit, their return was painless and they refunded my money quickly, but sadly, that didn't return what should have been a good Christmas present. Poor quality, Sony."
2,Ugly but it sounds okay.,"This stereo has lot's of power but lacks the ability to deliver details of the original music. It's loud but not really Hi Fi. The negative is it is really ugly! It would be good for a kid but not an adults home. Once again, Sony no longer cares about quality. They are too busy making video games. Try another brand."
1,Not a good sound,This stereo reads better than it sounds. I was disappointed when I played my CDs. The sound was not very good and it was missing power. The speakers are too small. Not a good product.
5,Great sound for a mini system,"Bought this think for a little music in my bedroom, for romantic times mainly. The sound is crystal clear! I have a suped-up hundreds-of-watts-per-speaker system in the living room, and the sound on this little system actually comes close (and that is NOT an attack on the expensive stereo, just how good this thing is).It also plays MP3-CDs, so you can rip a lot of music onto a CD.The biggest plus for me is the input - you can hook up different things, like an iPod. I have an XM satellite radio plugged into this and works seamlessly!The girls in my life like it too - all those little extras in addition to personality stack up nicely."
2,Trouble shooting Equalizer: Not too happy,I have followed the directions in the minimal insert enclosed but the Bass and Treble are non existent as far as I am concerned. Right now I feel like I should have bought a $20.00 CD player at a drug store. I have tried everything to increase the Bass and Treble to no avail. Any advice?
1,CD player quit working,I purchased this unit to play CD's in my office and the CD player quit within 12 months. I am very disappointed in Sony quality.
2,"Fine for three years, then kaput","I bought this compact shelf stereo system in July 2008. It worked fine until last month (July, 2011), and then crapped out completely. Having Sony fix it is too expensive to be practical. Even by the standards of 2011, that's not much of a ""shelf life."""
3,No RCA jack,"this stereo is well priced, and looks nice. However, I gave it a three star review for one component that was missing.It has a good design, and fits well in a home. It is not flashy and does not attract attention. To me, that is a strong point. The sound is good, and it plays MP3's. That is a major plus. The LCD screen is small, and easy to read. Sometimes, stereo units have flashy screens. This one does not. Nice and small, readable, and well designed.Cons-no RCA jack. you can plug an ipod in, but you cannot plug your TV in with out a special adapter."
4,Small Package Big Performance,We purchased the Sony CMTBX1 to use for church services we do in a nursing home. We wanted something small enough to carry with us but able to deliver a better sound than a portable unit. The CMTBX1 has delivered big time. On homemade CD's it delivers sound and quality far beyond our expectations.
3,Sony cmtbx1 micro,"These component system have a very good sound and features for the price.Very convenient size and portability,also plays cd and mp3's."
1,Lasted Two Years,"Purchased this unit for my mother-in-law who got exactly two years of relatively light use before the CD player started stuttering and finally stopped working. Based on the experience of the other one-star reviewers, I guess she should feel lucky. Very disappointed in Sony quality and durability of components."
1,Don't buy this Sony system,"I bought this Sony system in August of 2008. It has now broken (10/09). The disc 'drawer' says it doesn't have a disc in it when it does. I am beyond the one year warranty period, so shipping this off for repair is not worth the price. I realize this was an inexpensive ($99 when I bought it) system, but I expected it to last for much longer than a year."
3,Not so good,"I am a little dissapointed, the sound is not as good as i spected to be, just good sound, no Hi fi sound. Its just OK for the price and fits anywhere."
3,ok,This item is over priced and took way to long ...the first one i had to refuse because of the damage and now the one i got today is damaged to...hope they take care of this faster then it took to get it .
3,Better Than Expected,"I've been curious about this show for years. One of those 60s musicals that had a good run, but wasnt considered great by any means at the time and probably wont ever be revived. It was conceived for Steve and Eydie and in that form it succeeds. One allmost feels like you're at one of their Vegas shows from days gone by. The songs for the most part are pretty good. Some nice ballads here and Steve and Eydie put them over as you'd expect. I dont know how good the show was on stage (and adaption of the movie a Hole In The Head) but if you're a collector of Broadway shows, it's not a waste of money by any means. Plus there's Steve singing I Gotta Be Me! Ths show's breakout hit.........."
3,Great Steve and Eydie music.,"This was the first broadway show I saw, and I was dazzled at the time. Actually, it's not a bad show at all, has a pretty good score, with a couple of bona fide hits in He Needs Me Now and of course, I've Gotta Be Me. The rest is fine as well, with For Once In Your Life a very catchy ensemble number. It was glossy, colorful and fun. Good CD."
2,What?,"Maybe I just don't get these guys, but they strike me as an unbelievably irritating band. Her voice is absolutely atrocious. Maybe they're just one of those young kid bands that you won't understand if you're over 25, but I'll go ahead and give it 2 stars for track 4. His voice is pretty darn good. It's a shame that they've decided to go with her for the majority of their music. Yuck."
4,Really Good For Basics,"This book is absolutely great for describing the basics of Archery. It walks the reader thought all of the begining steps to enjoying the sport. Additionally, it encourages people not to rush out and buy equipment. Taking your time in purchasing archery equipment is critical to making sure that you get stuff that you like and stuff that fits you. The book could be a little better when describing how to aim. It doesn't talk about reference points or point of aim. Otherwise, the book is great."
3,"OK, not absolutely necessary ...","Well, I got this little guide mainly to fill out my archery library. It's OK, but there are quite a few better overall, more up-to-date guides out there."
1,"wonderful material, shoddily manufactured","Got this today in the post. Neither disc won't play correctly in either of my machines. These are DVD-Rs and are not described as such in info, nor is this set ""2:30:00"" long. There's 22 7 min or less cartoons, that equals about 150 min. Most are 6 min. Anyway, I'm gonna ask for a refund. One disc simply won't play, the other plays to a point then suddenly skips to the next cartoon. The discs are scuffed, shoddy, with a glued-on label. If the thing actually played I wouldn't care so much about the rotten video interlacing and terrible menu authoring. The shame is many of these cartoons are only available here. But if they won't play, what's the point?I'll be contacting Amazon in a minute."
1,caveat emptor,"Be very careful when ordering this DVD. Like many 'all region"" DVDs there may be problems in playing it on Amercan systems. it will not play on mine, and that's why I am retirning it."
2,Beware! Not an official release! Not a superior collection!,"This is not an official release. For whatever reasons the 8-volumeBetty Boop - The Definitive Collection [VHS] released 11 years ago on VHS & Laserdisc formats, the (so far) ultimate and remastered collection, remains unreleased by the copyright holder, Republic Pictures Home Video. People are reporting problems with these discs, hardly suprising, since they're buying them from pirates, and not the copyright holder.Do yourself a favor-- buy the video box set, and if you really *must* have them on DVD transfer them to DVD yourself, most new computers with a DVD burner can do this with a minimum of fuss and effort."
2,Betty Bloopers for Betty Boopers,"Overall, if you are a Betty Boop fan some of the selections here are worth looking at. This particular collection is not of the best quality. The videos have been copied from sources equal to what you can see free on U Tube. The particular collection I paid $25 for when opened had two dvds pop out of the case and landing on the floor. The case cannot hold the dvds. These were obviously used and numerous scratches were on the disc already. Sound quality is low and faint. 1/3 of the selections were unable to play completely. Hopefully there will be a better edition out there somewhere. For now get your Betty on U Tube."
2,Not very good,"Really a disappointment. The characters are both unlikeable and boring, the storyline is weak and just kind of rambles around. Just not very good at all. I bought it because of the positive recommendations here and I don't know what the other reviewers were thinking. Maybe they saw something I did not but overall this was a boring mess."
2,B grade film. Not a complete waste of time,Wanted to see what the Germans had to offer. I missed the point. x-Boyfriend trapped at x girlfriends house. hoping for some salvation in the face of armagedon. survive survive...no resolution succumbs to hoard. Hugs a zombie instead. Huh?
3,rammbock Interesting low budget film,"Okay first of all I am a big zombie film,and book fan.Unfortunately the market has become ""infected"" hee hee with so many films it is hard to chose.Rammbock while entertaining is short and really does not break any new ground except near the end of the film how they fight off the living dead.If your a huge zombie fan give it a try.Rammbock: Berlin Undead"
4,Pleasant Surprise,"This is an effective and efficient German zombie romp with affecting characters and suspenseful plotting.To be honest, I wasn't expecting much but found myself attracted to the interesting personalities and fairly sophisticated themes. The Berlin location adds a nice European gloss too."
4,Rammbock: Worth the wait?,"I heard about this movie months ago and waited with eager anticipation for its US release. Rammbock is the story of a group of survivors making due in Berlin during a ""Viral"" outbreak. The virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines (like zombies) that prey upon uninfected humans. Never once did the movie state that the infected were ""undead"" which was disappointing given the title of the movie. There was a palatable lack of gore and the zombie smashing/bashing I've become accustomed to in recent genre films. This movie lacked intensity, which was building during each scene and then lost at the moment of truth each time. Except for the lack of violence this was a decent Romero-esque zombie film laden with characters you could both identify and empathize with. I would like to have seen a longer movie but hey....budgetary restraints. I was thinking of adding this movie to my zombie collection and I still might but I doubt if I'll watch it with great enthusiasm."
1,Not the best Zombie movie I have seen,I found this German made Zombie movie pretty boring. Not much up close action. Honestly not much of anything to really enjoy about this stinker. I hope they don't even think about making a sequel to this bomb.
2,poor characters,You never get a chance to know and like these characters...so it is very hard to like this movie when it is more them and less zombies. Do like the sedative idea though...
2,Subtitled,"Amazon really needs to put it in the description when a movie is subtitled. Not only was it not in the description of this movie but the trailer, as far as I noticed, didn't show subtitles or anyone speaking anything other than English. Yes there are good movies with subtitles but sometimes I'm just too tired to spend an hour reading them and it detracts from my enjoyment. When there's disclosure of subtitles that's one thing. When there isn't I end up feeling like I've been taken. Amazon I keep asking you to include in the description when a movie isn't in the language of the target country and/or is subtitled. Please do it."
1,Low quality,"1st thought, this film should be good. But after I watched this film, I think I chose a long zombie film.Coz this film has no clear end."
4,Well Done!,Not the best outbreak film I've seen (28 days later still holds that title) but this movie was well thought out and put together in an interesting fashion. I can appreciate a well written script. There was no super savior in this movie. All the characters were quite flawed and very much scared as should be expected. The characters were true to life which gauges an audience to relate to them. In fact the one guy you think would be a hero had to be the biggest coward of them all. Overall I enjoyed the movie and felt it was well thought out. The title should not have undead in it. These guys were infected not zombies. That part was not thought out.
4,Short movie but really good..,I won't explain too much about the movie; you just need to know that is about zombies in germany and people try to run away from these zombies! The movie is in german but you have your english subtitles option. The movie is an hour long so is really short. Does not matter that the movie was too short still the plot was really good.. You should watch it if you like movies about zombies or any virus of that kind. THANKA!!
3,15 Exitos,"If you like the old traditional songs, you certainly will want this CD, or one of the others by Carlos y Jose, in your collection. If you buy more than one CD by this duo, you must exercise caution, however. You will find some of the same songs on each CD. For example, two years after this CD came out, they issued ""12 Exitos Originales, Vol. 3,"" which has seven of the same songs that are on this album. Whatever album you buy, be sure to get one with ""Las Tres Tumbas."" This songwill break your heart. It is the story of three brothers who go to a dance and are shot to death. Between this song and ""Rosita Alvirez"" I am getting the message that a young person is better off staying at home on the ranch. Oh, maybe you can go into town to buy a sack of seeds, but whatever you do, don't go to a dance!"
2,This video is what you are lookin for if....,"you just want to see clips around Oregon... not enough clips of Portland. It is made by the Hotel chain called ""Shilo Inn"" and would be something you expect to watch promoting vacation destinations. The music is NOT stunning, and there is no narrative on this film at all. Sub-par, really."
2,"PalmOne Excutive Case, Glad it Did Not Cost Me Much","Not knowing that my Palm Zire 72s already came with a case, I decided on this for half the price. The magnet used to close the case is pretty cool, but the functionality is not really there. For one, there is no way I am sticking a glue-like substance on my brand new Palm and two, it's way to small for the case. I think Palm needs to rethink the design, no wonder they offer it for half the price when you buy a Palm."
5,Loveable Learning,"I teach K-2 special education students and they can't get enough of this series! My students sometimes need a little break between challenging lessons but I hate putting them in front of a TV to watch something with no educational value. Busytown became an instant favorite for both me and the kids. The episodes all teach a lesson (crossing the street safely, stay away from fire, never try to cook alone in the kitchen) which are life lessons my special education students desperately need. I also like that each 30 minute episode has 3-4 little stories so I can put on just 1 or 2 if we have an extra 10 minutes at the end of the day."
5,Revisiting My Childhood,"I wasn't but 4 when I start watching The Busy World of Richard Scarry. And I love it. It was one of my all-time favorite animated series from the 1990s. I was extremely surprised when I ran in to this 3 Disc DVD set right here on Amazon and I had manage purchased it last year. This has only 30 episodes. That's half of the show I got for my collection. There's another DVD set going to be release on July 19, 2011. The DVD title is called ""Fun in Busytown"". It contains 35 episodes. That's the other half of the series. I recently find it right here on Amazon earilier this week. To be perfectly honest, I been praying for this DVD set to be released. And now it's finally answered. I'm really looking forward in getting it. And the only thing that I want to say about Cookie Jar and Mill Creek Enterainment is I'm extremely grateful for bringing this series to DVD and memories back."
3,LIMITED PROJECTS,"I BOUGHT THIS, THINKING IT WAS LIKE THE OTHER DISNEY PRINT CREATIONS SOFTWARE, IT IS AN OLDER ONE, SO IT WAS LIMITED ON IMAGES AND PROJECTS. I WOULDN'T BUY IT AGAIN."
3,Think before you buy this program,"Though this has a similar title to the excellent game Scooby Doo Phantom of the Knight, this program is very different in style. The gang compete against each other to get the phantom (which doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about the show), and it gets so tiresome after awhile because it is played almost like a board game. You have to either play with a friend, or against the computer and end up doing a lot of waiting for others to take their turns. Fun for a little bit, but very tedious after awhile. The point is, this program is not terrible, but it is not what you would expect with the Scooby Doo name. It is a competitive game, whereas the Scooby Doo Phantom of the Knight is an adventure with the whole gang working together to solve a mystery together."
3,Wish I could give more,"I've been a Scooby Fan forever, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this interactive game, the demo of which I had seen impressing me. Sadly though, despite a pretty accurate graphic detail the game is just too easy, and quickly loses it's appeal. The turn taking becomes frustrating rather quickly, and despite it's claimed multiple ending possibilities, this game won't come out of the box often. Good if you have younger children, but little for teens or older. Sorry Scooby, but this game could have and should have been better."
5,ergo-rapid diamond file,"Ideal sized tool for anything requiring rapid removel of material. Diamond technology outlast usual file/sandpaper modalities. Great for sharpening shears,axes,knives,or related implements. can be cleaned easily-used over and over. Suggest various 'grits' from Amazon to compliment types of applications needed. Highly recommended,used these products for years!"
3,Pretty Picture Book,"Ferguson's book titled ""Empire"" sets out to discuss the rise and fall of the British Empire in less than 400 pages, a large percentage of which are pictures. As you can guess from that sentence, he doesn't do a very good job in my opinion convincing me of anything. I will admit that the illustrations that were picked are excellent, and he generally hits all the major points along the empire trajectory, producing some interesting quotes from the various eras. Unfortunately, this is too much of a coffee table book to produce serious discussion. His central thesis, that the empire was superior to the alternatives at the time, is an interesting one, but unfortunately I cannot say that he backed it up that well. This is worth a library checkout, to read through and examine the pictures."
4,"Read, then judge for yourself","As a product of standard American-taught history, many of the ideas in this book were new to me. ""Imperial"" is so often used synonimously with ""evil"" that a justification of an empire is at least worth a look. Was India better of having been a colony? Perhaps. Read Marks' 'Origins of the Modern World' for an opposing view. This, I believe, is the real lesson of 'Empire:' take everything with a grain of salt, reach your own conclusions, and you can never learn too much about a given topic. Keep reading."
1,Wicked,If you would like to feel better about the abhorrent racism and murder that the U.K. has been responsible for then this is the book for you!
3,Organised robbery,"The chapter on India was enlightening. The extent of British ivolvement in the slave trade surprised me. British bad behavior in Ireland is barely mentioned. Would the Brits behave in an English area they way they did in Ulster, which is supposidly an integral part of the not so united U.K.? Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book."
5,Just too Good,"Amazing Book. Its a must for anybody who has interest in Foreign Policy. Britian is the reason behind most of the worlds changes today and this book tells us how, when, where and why."
3,Entertaining yet Limited,"This is a well-written and lively account of the British Empire from its earliest beginnings to its bitter end. There is much humour, sarcasm, and wit therein. Many interesting tales are told and much fact is unburdened in an unassuming way. The book is, however, superficial, perhaps as a result of being lay in orientation and so wide in scope, and there is a curious anachronistic form of moral assessment throughout that is questionable. Many points made by Ferguson are surely tenuous. The political aim of the author is to alert readers to the reality of a supposed present-day American empire and to make them more amenable to its existence as a potential boon to the world in the same way as the British empire had once been. One is left wondering whether Ferguson the Scot is offering good advice or misconstruing the ethos of America and its people."
4,Accurate never.,"Niall Ferguson's book Empire has it's good points and it's terrible points. The gentleman is out to prove hisConservative credentials. This means abuses of the oppressed are glossed over, and only the British system isglorified. In my view, this comprehensive history will not last more than 10 years as a source of knowledge.For this I give three reasons:1. There is too much smug satisfaction in being British.2. Much of this book is plagiarized from Kissinger's very skimpy notes, which Ferguson has access to, consideringthat ostensibly he is supposed to be busy writing a biography of Kissinger.3. This gentleman does not teach at Harvard."
2,Bad Score; Bad Show; Awful Price???,"I cannot believe that someone is charging $34.98 for this mediocre recording of a lousy show. Who's got the rights--Steve Lawrence? There's only a few original cast albums I'd pay that much for and they are ""Donnybrook!"" and ""Anya."" Why aren't they on CD?"
4,Perfect replacement for usb cable for Antec laptop cooler,I broke the USB cable that powers up my Antec laptop cooler. I really did not want to buy another laptop cooler and this product saved me from having to do that. You will lose the by-pass usb feature that came with the original Antec USB power cable but you'll gain the the retractable feature that comes with this product. I am very happy that I found this and bought it.
1,Don't bother.,I bought this to replace the cord on my lapcool 2 and it worked well for about a week then it quit working. Way too fragile for daily use.
2,Wrong plug,"It's advertised as a 3.5 mm plug, however the one they sent me did not fit my Antec Notebook Cooler (which requires a 3.5 mm cable)."
2,Plug size wrong. Either picture is wrong or description is wrong,"The picture here shows a 2.1mm output plug while the description states it's 3.5mm. I believe that is why so many are saying it will not fit their device. They are ordering it thinking it is a 3.5mm plug as described but if they are getting what's pictured, it looks like they'd receive a 2.1mm plug on the end instead. Someone should clarify this and correct this listing so more people don't order the wrong one. I almost did myself."
5,classic ENGLISH INTERIORS,"Well titled.This too was gifted,The receiver was quite pleased.Although this referred to a way of life no longer enjoyed by the masses, the ideas contained are very adaptable to the times we live in & the last chapter [s] of 'how to's are very helpful to the new homemaker.A very good book as well as 'coffee table' material."
3,Wrong MaxLife 369!,"I have the tripod version, and it's great. Picked it off this website to give my son for Christmas- and screwed up by not taking enough time to drill down the descriptions. Got the non-tripod version, for tripod version price. OK flashlight. Not what I had planned as a gift. Mildly pissed off. Don't pay over $19!"
3,Oops! This is not the tripod version.,"I mistakenly bought this thinking it was the version with the tripd legs and the tilt head, but it's not. The fact that it's priced only about 10-15% lower than the tripod fooled me.That being said, it's a good flashlight, but not a great flashlight. There are comaprable conventional hand lights for less money."
2,369 flashlight obsolete,"I bought this light because I had purchased several of them a couple of years ago for Christmas presents and they were the best light at that time. I needed a gift for a friend so I ordered this one. I have discovered since that there are much brighter,much lighter flash lights out there. I will be upgrading.Michael J. Blaisdell"
2,Worked great until it didn't,I bought this flashlight about a year ago and was reasonably happy with it. Then two of the led lights stopped working and the four-position toggle switch started working erratically. Whenever I buy a quality flashlight I expect it to last pretty much forever. The Stanley let me down bigtime. A much better flashlight (although more expensive) is the Smith & Wesson Galaxy 13 LED Flashlight or probably any other in the Smith & Wesson line.
5,Invites debates and consideration of all sides,"This collection of arguments on compelling problems of America provides a range of viewpoints, invites debates and consideration of all sides, and surveys issues important to humanitarian causes. From assessments of American global domination and imperialist purposes in the world to its quest for security and expanded world influence, this provides an essential source of particular recommendation to high school and college-level courses on social issues."
3,Gilligan in the Old West,"Essentially a western version of ""Gilligan's Island,"" Dusty's Trail is a TV series about a wagonful of homesteaders lost on the untamed American frontier after being separated from their wagon train. This volume contains the following four episodes:""Brookhaven U.S.A.""The group stumbles on a deserted town and decides to stay there, not realizing that the army plans to blow up the place as a test.""Here Come the Grooms""Dusty and Callahan are kidnapped by two hillbillies looking for husbands for their homely sisters.""Horse of Another Color""Dusty accidentally ropes an apparently wild horse and decides to keep it, until he gets arrested as a horse thief.""Phony Express""A wounded soldier says that Dusty must take over his job as courier and get an important pouch the rest of the way to a nearby fort."
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"I had the privilege of being a part of ""unseenamerica New York State"". As part of our class project, our instructor gave us this book to read. As I was reading the many short stories, I couldn't help thinking about the people in them. They're all steelworkers. Many of them retired or unemployed from the devastating steel mill closings and bankruptcies. Their stories made me laugh and they made me cry. I can only imagine the life they lived. The stories give their industry a face. It also gives the industry a sense of shame as well. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. And it's given me creativity in my writings. Read it!!"
1,it sucks!,the sound is horrible and the font size it too small does not let you adjust it too pricey for what you it sorry i wasted my money on it......
4,MUY BUENO,EL DICCIONARIO ES MUY BUENO Y CREO QUE LO MEJOR EN SU CLASE. SOLO CREO QUE HAY QUE MODIFICARLE EL SOSTEN DE LA CUBIERTA PORQUE SE CAE MUCHO CON EL SISTEMA ACTUAL. MAS ADELANTE SE SUGIERE QUE SE MEJORE LA PANTALLA Y SUS EFECTOS VISUALES PARA OFRECER OTRO PRODUCTO DIFERENTE PARA CLIENTES MAS EXIGENTES. GRACIAS
2,Not for people over forty,While the device worked as advertised the small screen size makes playing word games difficult. The font size can be adjusted for dictonary uses but not for word games such as hangman and anagrams. This makes for difficult viewing in low light or without magnification.
4,One of Good Dictionaries,"Using not long enough to give out precise review about the product. But in short time of use, I can say it is one of the goods. It's compact, has good features, small button of course, fast respond, dull voice with some words..."
4,show really tapers off. special features save this dvd.,I watched the first two episodes at a friends house and immediately fell in love. It was up there with some of the best sketch comedy ever. I quickly ordered the dvd but when I watched all the episodes the quality went downhill fast. The episodes in the second half of season one were not even close to the quality of the first few episodes.The special features really save this dvd set. There's too many to list. I wish more dvd sets would go all out on special features like this one does.
2,meh.,"The State > Human Giant.... I guess anyone under 25 wouldn't know about that.Can't discredit HG completely, they are funny. I do find some of the sketches hysterical, some lukewarm, some unfunny. My dissonance lies in the writing aspect - I tend to hold writers in high regard, especially when those writers are the performers/creators. I guess it irks me since 'The State' was my favorite show from the 90's but doesn't get the respect it deserves *ahm ahm effing MTV release the dvd*angry and apparently elitist this afternoon."
5,Fetzer-Proof!,"If there was any doubt that sketch comedy shows could work in the new millennium, Human Giant disproves it. I can only assume MTV was skeptical when these three hilarious young comedians came to them with their mission statement to make a comedy program accessible to everyone except Amazon.com's own Bret Fetzer, but their investment paid off and the results are top-notch.Buy this DVD and prepare yourself for hours of entertainment."
4,awesome,hilarious. i loved it. any plans to release season two?! i wish MTV still made sketch comedy shows. really funny
5,Helped me achieve steady lose!,"I just came to Amazon to purchase more of this Herbalife product, as I realized my slow but steady weight lose of 1-2 pounds a week stopped since I ran out. I was taking 2 tablets 3 times a day...especially when I made poor choices in my diet. It seems quite effective to me...and I also found it improved my overall digestive health. I wasn't sure if it contained enough fiber to make a difference in ""regularity,"" but it did and what ever it is, I am a fan!"
2,Don't waste your money,I would not recommend this product to anyone. I did not have any results from taking it and by watching the video about what the product was suppose to do to the fat that you take in was misleading because nothing was changed with me. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!!
1,Defective MP3s,BEWARE! The last four tracks of this record are full of static and completely unlistenable. DO NOT BUY!
3,"Nice Writing, But...","The stories went right over my head. I knew that there was supposed to be some sort of meaning to them, but they were pretty bizarre. They are like portraits of ordinary life with a twist of weirdness. I figured these stories were supposed to have some kind of moral, but it escaped me.And the characters all seemed ruthlessly unhappy, so much so that I became depressed myself. They didn't need to be recklessly happy, but their lives were so messed up and in the end, their problems were unsolved, and that's why it was so depressing.This is a collection of stories that need to be read and re-read so that one can understand the meanong of them. Because I certainly don't."
2,Meh...,"In short, speaking as a reasonably advanced user, I found Stomp to be big and clunky and not nearly as easy to use as it should be. And the price? Yikes! When I finaly let go of the fact that I had blown a bunch of bucks on it I dumped it and went to a great little freeware app called SyncBack."
2,Paul In Madison,"The software will not recognize my backup device. My Dell Inspiron 5150 laptop (XP Home) is hooked to a Seagate External 160gb hard drive via a USB cable. Yes, everything is working, plugged in and rebooted. BackUpMyPC still only sees the computer's CD and Stomp's web site tech support recommends installing the set-up drivers that came with the external drive which I have done. So, I'm disappointed and can not recommend."
5,A Message For The Heart,"This story is one that leads the reader through many of life's trials and tribulations and then brings us to a conclusion of hope. I first learned of the book when celebrity Connie Stevens held it up on her segment on Home Shopping Network. She commented on how inspirational ""Silent Rain"" was and encouraged everyone interested in a true, encouraging story to purchase it if possible. That intrigued me, I read it, and can attest to this....message for the heart!"
4,A Book that Touches the Heart,"Silent Rain is a rewarding journey as the lovely main character stumbles, struggles, overcomes tragedies and heartaches with the grace of God. Her deep moments of despair are dissolved by her faith in the Divine Power that eventually rescues her from near death. Keep in mind that this is a true story based on the life of the author, Nancy V.If you believe in the love of the Lord, Silent Rain will touch your heart"
5,The best game ever,"Settlers3 is a very exciting game. You have to get everything alright. One foul can mean a stop to all the produces. Settlers3 is a replica of the real roman, egyptian en asians kingdoms. If you want some more information visite the website..."
2,Could have been so much more,"As much as I LOVE King of the Hill, I hoped the game would be even partially as entertaining.No such luck.This game is boring, monotonous, way too simple, and predictable.It might be good for a child.I'd rather watch the shows. Too bad, though. A video or computer game would have been SO much fun!"
4,simple and effective,"This book helped me completely change my attitude towards food and eating. I've been taking some ayurvedic threatment for digestion for a long time now, but none of the things I took helped me feel the difference as much as when I started listening to my recorded affirmations I made while reading this book. There is no indigestion now and whats amazing no GUILT when eating delicious ""bad"" food. :D"
5,This book is excellent,"Yes, some of the stuff in the book is a bit far out. But it has some of the best positive affirmations I have ever seen for getting oneself into the mental groove that is critical for successful weight loss! Highly recommended. The rest of Ms. Ray's books were a bit disappointing, but this one is worth it."
4,stories within stories...,"...fantasy within fiction, eroticism within contempt for societal `norms'....this compelling book is an erotic lace-work of the extremely hedonistic yet solitary don rigoberto's mind of absurd surreal life as insurance drone to his idealistic romance with his wife lucretia. interrupted by devil-child.the themes within themes of this book are highly complex, including an intriguing introduction to egon schieles' artistry. the surprises are endless, as are his essays from life-as-defined-by leisure to the erotic affects of urination.it is hard to summarise this novel. it covers so many issues that it is a wonder it is only contained within 259 pages. i was craving so much more at the end. mario vargas llosa is a genius once again."
4,Wonderful!,Loved it. Hilarious and quite titillating. (I'd say more but I read the book almost twenty years ago - this comment is provoked by the news that Mario Vargas Llosa has won the Nobel Prize for literature - and quite deservedly so.)
5,"Move over, Restif de la Bretonne","A book that is intelligent, educated and humorous. Surely what one expects from Vargas Llosa, although in previous books he did not always deliver. I like the fact that, as a reader, one has to do some thinking instead of just turning pages. Fonchito's past indelicacy with his stepmother reminds me of Thomas Mann's ""The Buddenbrocks"" and the aunt who did this ""terrible thing"" that is never explained.This is a wonderful book but, maybe, not for the faint of heart."
3,In praise of hedonism,"After his separation from Lucrecia, Don Rigoberto lives from fantasy. His notebooks are full of erotic dreams, memories from the past, and letters never meant to be sent. Don Rigoberto seeks to explain and to live life through art and erotic love, rejecting anything referent to the ""man-herd"", the collective. He gets progressively involved with his dreams, to the point of threatening his sanity. His son Fonchito tries to help reconcile his father and stepmother, not without submitting them to his intriguing games."
5,Forcing Form/Forming Force,"This book addresses a universal question in regards to understanding and, more importantly, presenting an abstract, yet more comprehensible reference between architecture and other contextual elements. Stan Allen proposes that they are all fractions of a common system, the most complex order of `the city' in this case. He has eloquently woven various aspects of these manifold connections through his writings, and validated them in extremely stimulating diagrams. The results are projects that are filters for seeing figures of architecture in exchange with the background of the city. Architecture is complicated; not by itself, but because it is a component in a complicated network. This condition in the city can be manipulated by (and through) architecture--in the form (and force) of a point, other times of a line, but most of the time both."
