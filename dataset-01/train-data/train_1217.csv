3,not as great as I had hoped,"These are very nice quality and they came quickly. but my dogs still pull with them. I have very tough dogs and have put time in training them but they still pull. I have used training collars, head haltis and pinch collers. I have been to several training classes also. I put a C.D on my Bouvier and I was in a dog club for several years so I really do know what I am doing.They work great foe some dogs but not mine."
3,Depends On The Pup,"I really like this harness, it works well with deterring pulling. My only issue with this is that after a few weeks (it might have even been a few days) the front loosens up. Then it loosens with every walk. This is no good for a dog who can escape or for an aggressive dog. And if you have one that is both, then you need a better harness. A martingale collar/harness combo might be better for you."
2,Easy Walk Harness,"It is just ok. It doesn't fit my 11 lb yorkie very well. As she is walking, the adjustable straps loosen and she has stepped out of it a couple of times. I do think if it fit properly, it would effectively keep her from pulling her leash. It is also difficult to put on her."
3,Loosens easily and can be eaten by the dog if he's allowed to wear it without supervision,"Loosens easily and can be eaten by the dog if he's allowed to wear it without supervision. When on and tightened properly it makes for a more disciplined dog walk. Unfortunately, this was not meant for a Jack Russell terrier!"
4,Premier Easy Walk dog harness,"This doesn't work as well as teh gentle leader for long walks. But, it works better and is more secure for my Houdini dog than a regular harness you could buy at the store. So, I think it is good to have more than one system for your dog. This paired with the gentle leader for longer walks is a great combination system for my puggle puppy who is very hyperactive."
4,No more pulling from my Husky Pup,"I got this for my Siberian Husky puppy when he was about 3.5 months old, he was 22 pounds at the time. It is a bit hard to adjust, and it becomes un-adjusted/loose pretty quickly, but even when the fit isn't perfect, it does it's job. I was a little worried, because before I got this, he was pulling quite hard on his traditional collar when on his leash. So hard that he seemed to be choking himself and was making that terrible huffing/panting/you-are-choking-yourself sound. (Why the heck do dogs do that?) Once I got this harness on him, he tried once again to pull, but he ended up pulling himself around to face me. He caught on pretty quick that he could not pull if he wanted to look ahead, and now he walks really well. I'm going to have to purchase the size medium as he gets older, but as of now at 5 months and 30 pounds, it still fits him well, as he is pretty tall and skinny."
4,"Stops dog from pulling, but a few problems","Bought this harness a few months ago for our Lab puppy who is now 7 months old. She loves to pull while on walks, but with this harness it reduces the pulling by 90-95%. It is amazing in regards to that. The only bad thing about it is it chafes her armpits and is causing her to lose her hair and get a pretty nasty rash/scab on the one armpit where the buckle is. We have it fitted correctly, but we can't use it everyday or her one armpit start bleeding."
2,Works Great but...,"This product worked just as advertised but it is of very poor quality. I have a 70 pound dog. She pulled twice at the start of the walk and I stopped and gave the leash a tug per instructions. The dog still pulled for a bit but not much. However, I stopped to adjust the harness and noticed the strap was almost completely torn through next to where the hook for the leash was. This was my firt walk with the product. I didn't pull that hard. We hadn't even gone 200 yards from the house."
4,A few suggestions to improve a great product,"I found the Easy Walk harness truly effective from the start. Just to be sure, after a few walks with Gentle Leader. I tried the standard collar and leash again. The difference is like night and day. Our 7 month old puppy has a different brand of harness also designed to stop pulling. I is barely better than a collar alone.Premier Gentle Leader It is definitely the best harneaa I have found.My suggestions would include one more stabilizing strap (on the back) running from neck to the belly strap to minimize shifting. And turdier connectors. Our English Bull Terrier puppy grabbed the harness purchased for his bigger buddy, a gentle but strong Boxer Shepard mix, with a strong chase instinct. In the time it took to get it away from the puppy, (less than a minute) he had cracked the plastic clasp for the neck strap. Hoping super glues can put it back together.If that doesn't hold I will buy another Easy Leader."
2,Okay but mine broke,"I have gone through two of these harnesses simply because they keep breaking. I have a 7 month old golden mix who would constantly tug while walking. This harness was recommended and while it help significantly, the two I used broke. I tried it for a second time because I had positive results. But the second time was enough. I switched to another brand and thus far I have no problems."
4,easy harness,"Good product, easy to put on, I have a bloodhound mix which is very hard to walk. This harness help on the walk but is not the cure."
4,This helped!,"She's only 21 lbs but our dog was pulling like mad with a traditional harness. Although it didn't solve the problem completely, I will say the Easy Walk harness improved her pulling about 80%. She still pulls a bit but not as forceful and not nearly as constant. Not a complete miracle, but it's a great help and definitely worth a try for you dog!"
3,Harness,We bought this harness for our 60lb lab mix. It stopped her pulling on the first try. We do find it gets loose and we have to re-adjust it quite often. We measured her and found we could either buy the large or the tween size. Maybe we should have bought the smaller size. We also put some padding around the chest strap as she was getting bald spots from the rubbing. (She has very short hair)I am happy we bought it. She is much easier to walk. I just wish it did not loosen up so fast.
1,CAUTION: NOT FOR DOGS WITH SHORT LEGS!,"This harness does improve one's control over the dog and minimises that pulling reflex that occurs in most dogs when they feel lead resistance from behind.My huge complaint is that it dosen't work, and is actualy dangerous, for dogs with short legs such as my Corgi, Dachshunts and the likes. I was walking my Cordi near heavy traffic and he slipped through the harness. Thank God he stayed near me! I tried making the harness tighter but that restricted his movements.There difinately should be a caution on the box about this issue."
1,Warning - NOT A PRODUCT FOR DOGS LOW TO THE GROUND.,"I had to return 2 of these harnesses (and got dinged a 20% restocking fee from this seller - on top of the cost of shipping both ways). This harness does not work with short dogs. Both my dogs fit the ""girth measurement"" but the loop where the leash attaches drags on the ground. My two dogs were able to walk out of the thing and kept getting their front legs tangled up. Also there is one dimension where the harness can't be adjusted so you might find, as I did, that the girth measurement is correct, but it still is too big for your dog. The description should have warned the owners of ""short"" dogs that this would not be a good choice."
2,Didn't work for us,"We had this on our dog 2 times. I was using it primarily to tether him in the back of the car (otherwise he jumps all over). On the 2nd time, he bit through it! Could just be my dog, he's quite over the edge. But, something for you to consider."
2,Harness Doesn't Stay Put!,"I bought this for my Boston Terrier as she is a big puller. The first few times I took her out with it, she seemed a bit confused by the leash in the front and she did pull less. But after she got used to it, the pulling quickly returned. Since the leash attaches in the front and she is walking in front, the leash gets easily tangled. The harness also slips around on her a lot to where it's practically sideways. Adjusting for a tighter fit does not seem to solve the problem, in part because when I adjust the straps they don't stay, but work themselves loose so I will have to stop and readjust on a walk. If the harness stayed put and had a fixed ring for the leash (instead of one that moves a few inches side to side on a loop) it might work. But I would advise against buying this version."
3,Good for Smaller-Medium dogs,"I bought this harness for my great dane mix under the supervision of a trainer at Petsmart. It was a great harness until she was about 60+ pounds. The large that I got for her is not doing it's job of keeping her with me. Instead she keeps pulling on it. I've now changed to the gentle leader to continue her training for walking on a leash.Also, don't leave this on your pet unsupervised, it's very easily chewed through."
2,Not For A High Drive Dog,"While im sure this harness works well with some dogs...i found that it had NO effect on our 5 month old GSD , he is 65lb of pulling power whos drive i is VERY strong...if he wants something, he will do what he can to get it. The minute i put this on i regretted it, he pulled more on this harness than on a regular one! It works almost like a agitation collar for bite work...the harder he pulls...the more excited he would get. We resorted to a Prong Collar as i DO NOT like chock chains. He now heels nicely ."
2,Awkward sizing,"I have two dogs. A 20 lb skinny Boston Terrier and a 25 lb Frenchie/Boston mix. I bought the small for the Boston and it was a little too snuggled for him, but was usable. I decided to get the Medium for my Frenchbo and it was HUGE. I adjusted all the straps but it was still really loose on him.I bet this would work better for bigger dogs but not for medium-sized dogs."
2,Amazon Prime is great!,"This harness starting to create a wound underneath our dogs front arms!! We had to stop using it. It's very hard to keep it firmly fit on a large dog. So, keep an eye on your dog to make sure he's NOT injured."
1,Fits poorly,"The upper two straps fit, however the chest strap does not adjust short enough. In addition the adjustment clips on the chest piece do not hold, therefore everytime you pull on the leash the chest strap lengthens more making it fit even more poorly."
1,Curbed Pulling But Bruised My Pit,"This was recommended to me for my rambunctious pitbull who pulls me more than I pull him. It did make waking him much easier but in turn it rubbed his skin raw and he has bruises. I changed him to his old harness. Still looking for something that does make it easier to walk him without hurting him in the process. If it hadn't hurt him, I would have rated it 5 stars."
3,Toby,"We bought this for our dog, he is a small breed. I just don't think it works as well for smaller dogs. I know I had the fit right, and it got caught underneath his legs several times. If your dog is small I would go for a puppia superior harness, it is great."
2,Dog loved too much,"The ad says dogs love it! I put it on him (he's an 8 yr old Aussie), adjusted it to fit, went to get his leash and when I got back he had already chewed right through it!"
2,A seller issue and a product issue,"Received this item and it appeared used. It came in a plastic baggie with no instructions or packaging, mailed inside a bubble mailer envelope. I decided to overlook what appeared to be a second hand item and try it on my dog, it did not fit. The listing only said ""Small"" so I looked up the product on Google and a small should have been the right size for my daschund/jack russell mix, but it was several inches shy of fitting around his chest. Was sold and shipped by NorAm International Partners, Inc., they do not take returns but Amazon customer service is taking the return. (Thanks, Amazon!)"
1,easy walk pet harness,The leash gets tangled in her legs with any amount of slack. It is good for the city but I can't recommend it for the country or suburbs.
2,Not a Win-Win situation,"I bought this for my German Shepherd who practically drags me in the beginning of our walks. While I agree that this product reduces pulling, it also gave her rashes underneath her armpits. Not sure if large was the right size for her either because it seemed like the strap that crosses her legs and chest kept coming loose even after I asked a Petco employee to make sure the adjustments were correct."
1,Non-Starter,"I struggled with the clasps on this harness, but once closed, I could not open them, and was afraid that even if I succeeded,I might not get it off when it was on the little dog. So it was a failed purchase, and I still have it here, unused."
4,works good,"The harness is sturdy and easy to put together, a lot better than collars that go around the neck. No complaints over here."
4,Measure carefully if dog has a narrow breast,"This is a good harness for sighthounds, but beware the sizing. My borzoi has a 30"" barrel, so I got her the large. But the chest strap will not shorten up enough. I can alter it myself, but if you have a narrow-breasted dog, go for the smallest size that will fit around the barrel. FWIW - the breeder loaned us one that fits right (probably the correct size - I messed up when ordering) and it works like a dream. Even when the dog tried to take off after a feral cat."
3,Cloth on harness began to shred after 45 days of twice-daily use,"This is our second Easy Walk Harness, bought 45 days ago. Our wheaten chewed up the first one - our ""fault,"" I guess, as we'd left it on a counter where she got it, and she'd already chewed up two cloth-and-plastic collars. We should've known! The second one we ""hid"" from her behind a TV in the kitchen each time we took it off her (she cannot reach it there), but even so the nylon strap near the front metal attachment has begun to shred! I'm going to reinforce it with carpet thread stitching, but still - shouldn't the material have lasted a little longer? P.S. I wrote to the company and they are replacing it. I'll have to pay postage, however!"
2,Not for running!,"I bought this harness for my 75 pound psycho-dog after a prong collar and gentle leader failed to stop the pulling. It seems to work okay if she's not too hyper and if we're just walking, but don't use it for running with your dog unless your dog will run beside you! (And in that case, why use a harness at all?) My dog goes nuts when we run and she pulls me so hard I was hoping this harness would make it so she couldn't pull me and we could just go for a nice easy run. Instead she pulled as hard as she usually would and this harness rubbed holes in her legs! She was screaming and barking (moreso than she usually does from the excitement of running) and I thought it was just from frustration of not being able to pull me but when we came inside I noticed the front of her legs were rubbed raw! I won't be using this harness for running anymore. Unfortunately I don't know what else to try. Also it's really hard to fit this thing to your dog properly. Good luck!"
5,Surprisingly effective,We bought this for our border collie who we rescued two years ago. She has always pulled when being walked on a leash and neck collar. With this harness she no longer pulls and walking her is now a pleasure. I highly recommend this product.
5,Amazing stuff that blows away mainstream garbage.,"If you look up the word ""talent"" in the dictionary, you will see a picture of this band right next to it. This album is as perfect as a metal record can be. Not a single mediocre track, nothing to be skipped, you can play this one over and over again, soon finding yourself to sing along to most songs.Want symphonic-style choruses? Want hard riffs? Want great creative drumming? Want amazing guitar solos? This one's got it all.Some people say ""Theater of Salvation"" is better than this album, but I strongly disagree. ""Vain Glory Opera"" is perfection at its finest."
5,One of the best metal albums I ever bought...,"...definitely is Edguy's Vain Glory Opera. Power Metal from the beginning to the end - awesome. Tobias Sammets voice is stunning, bringing up the variety from ballads to fast and heavy tracks.A MUST!Joe"
3,Audience?,"The book is good. It got my blood pressure up, though, when they spent the first 164 pages telling me how to install, migrate from other office suites, etc. Then finally we got to the OOo instructional material. I think most readers are not getting their very first exposure to OOo with this book. As a free application, most will have poked around in an installation of the free OOo and then decided to buy a book. For that reason, I feel they didn't spend much time thinking about their audience. Ok to start with kudos to the application, but then get to the meat of OOo. Don't waste my time plowing through a bunch of stuff I have already handled with the help fiies of the free download! Notwithstanding the books good content, I feel the authors and publishers deserve a slap to wake them up for the next edition."
5,Finally on CD!,"Thank you for having the good taste to put this relic on cd! Want to hear some classic rock? Then turn off them classic rock stations that pollute the air with the Eagles, Eric Clapton, and the rest of that sorry lot, and listen to some genuine rock 'n' roll. If there's a better song than ""Pay the Price,"" then I haven't heard it. ""Hard Luck Story,"" ""Be a Woman,"" and ""Free Ride"" are as good as ever. Even the cornball acoustic stuff is bearable. Stop listening to ""artists"" and check out some actual musicians. If you already listen to Kid Rock, it's probably too late, so exercise caution."
4,"""Getting"" a darn good read","Getting Near the End is an Orwellian type glimpse of a future time (2023) when the world is in chaos and big brother style governments and institutions are running amok. This apocalyptic vision, graphically and convincingly realistic, is complemented by an array of strong, compelling characters many of whom are uniquely gifted and tragically flawed. A manned space flight to Mars provides the metaphor; escaping from a desperate reality by diverting attention to an enticing possibility. Martha Nova and her followers introduce the premise and the promise of a Messiah who can create a better place. A wonderful and intelligently crafted yarn."
5,A deftly presented human drama,"Getting Near The End is both an apocalyptic science fiction story and a deftly presented human drama about the very last days. On New Year's Eve, the world is consumed with terror at the brink of its end, yet there is time for one last celebration, featuring a megastar singer whose music seemingly has the power to predict the future. Getting Near The End is an enthralling and highly recommended science fiction saga that matches the length of a song to the remaining time of the world, and is a true ""page-turner"" of interpersonal problems dramatically heightened by a sense of panic that keeps the reader absorbed until the fiery end."
5,sweet read,"Carroll provides a thoughtful and incisive meditation on race, history and culture--a collage of perspectives that elaborates and enriches the discourse on race."
3,The Tempation Sheriff,"This is a fairly good ""I don't have time to look for a wife but I need one"" romance. It's a fast, smooth read with enough sizzle to make it interesting. The sheriff of Temptation, Texas is more than a little busy because the town is expanding and therefore not quite the sleepy little town it once was. His two best friends have recently succumbed to the idea of marriage and are blissfully happy - so much so that Sheriff Cody decides that there must be something to this idea of a wife. But without the time to search out the available ladies, he mentions that maybe advertising would work. His friends get the ball rolling, and the race is on...."
4,Lots of fun songs.,Not mixed but good songs. Well work the buck as you get 4 cds and there were songs I never heard that were good.
3,Decent Enough,"Some pleasant orchestral numbers, with some Indian and Oriental-type music thrown in, and one track with the almost-mandatory ""Sakamoto-heavy-drum"" sound. Pleasant to throw on while reading, but no big whoop."
4,a matter of support,"Tom Direnzo has captured Portland Maine in a unique and realistic manner. His characters are delightful, eccentric yet realistic. Frank Mangino takes us into the inner workings of the Maine Child Support Enforcement Office through his own eyes and experiences. Whether it's the tart tongued clerk Madeline or Wild Bill, the renagade enforcement agent, the characters are charming if a little rough around the edges. I hope to see Frank Mangino as the central character in a series of books!A quick read, I read it in a day!"
1,dull blades not worth the money,barber injector blades not worth the money. TOO DULL AFTER ONE USE. SHICK BLADES WERE GOOD FOR SEVERALSHAVES.
4,Old School,These razor blades are the best because you can wash out the hair that gets in the razor those new type with all the blades you can not get in between the blades.
4,Sturdy and Spacious!,"We got this for my two year old daughter. It comes assembly required, but it is very easy to put together (phillips head screwdriver required). It is a very attractive piece and very sturdy. It holds a large quantity of toys, and my daughter loves it. It did have a slightly chemical smell when it first arrived, so we let it air out for a day before putting toys in it, and now it is just fine!"
1,What a rip off!,"It came as a very ""used"" product. When I tried to contact the company, they ignored all attempts. Not a good company to work with."
1,Zilch!,"I've been taking these pills every night for the past six weeks. There has been absolutely no difference whatsoever. No change in breast size and no reduction in acne. I bought it after reading all the raving reviews but unfortunately, I guess it just doesn't work for everyone. I'll keep taking the pills until my supply runs out but I have lost faith that it will work."
1,Nothing!,I'm afraid that as much as we all wish products like this would work they really don't so save your money. I have been taking these for over 2 months now and there has been ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE to my breasts whatsoever.
3,"Insight Guide Indonesia, Fifth edition","The picture on the front page of the guide I received does not match the one presented. I was disappointed to see that on the page 292 is a picture of the bird that does not live in any part of Indonesia, and above picture is written ""Tanjung Puting has rich birdlife"". I hope that it is the only incorrect information in the book. Otherwise the guide is ok, a lot of information, maps, pictures..."
3,Must watch intro video first,"In response to the above review: From what I understand, you have to watch the introductory video ""Bring Back the Romance of Dance: Instruction Series Overview"" to learn the basic steps. Then you watch these videos to go into more detail on particular dances."
4,Unmitigated Listening Pleasure,"Quoting from the liner notes: ""Gamelan Pacifica is a professional ensemble in residence at the Cornish College of Arts in Seattle. Inspired by the gong/chime orchestras of Java and Bali (collectively known as gamelan), the ensemble performs new and innovative music in an international style ..."" To my western ears, traditional gamelan music is enjoyable, but a little goes a long way. Trance Gong contains music that has more stylistic and sonic variety than traditional gamelan, however, and the net result is an hour of unmitigated pleasure for the listener."
4,Where are the reviews for this year?,"Look at the reviews and you'll find that those who gave this product a poor rating have never used the most recent addition. I really don't care what someone may think about an old product because it has nothing to do with THIS product. One reviewer ever calls it ""KTC""... sorry but they have not used the name Kiplinger's since the 2000 version.Get a clue.THIS product does as good a job as any, is easy to follow, imports Quicken data just fine (if you have it set up correctly to begin with), has the features that mean the most and does it as a cost far less than TurboTax."
2,Another disappointment,"This is the second time I've tried KTC and the second time I've been disappointed. I'm a loyal Turbo Tax user who believed the box of this product when it said ""seamless transfer from last year's Turbo Tax."" Didn't happen like that.Did not transfer as advertised; the screens look like they're out of an old DOS program; the navigator is much better in Turbo Tax; there is no bar on the videos to tell you how much longer you have to endure it; and it wouldn't recognize Dept of Defense as an employer for W-2 download.These are just a few of the reasons I'm taking advantage of the 60 day money back guarantee. I guess that's what i get for trying to save a buck.Better luck next year Kiplinger's Tax Cut."
3,"Fed Ok, States Not","The Federal program worked ok for me, though the interface is a bit clunky. However, the MD state program has some minor glitches, and the WV state program doesn't handle part-year residents, which of course I didn't know until I fired it up at the last minute..."
2,Tax Cut Premium,"I have used this product frequently. This is the first time (and the last time because we will not order it again) WE HAVE USED PREMIUM.For a simple return it is great!This product is TAX CUT PREMIUM!It has all the bells and whistles according to the desriptions- Right ! If you have a more complicated return.....:1. The software may not directly support input with their tax information. The info is canned and pasteurised for Mr. Joe or Jolene average. But you have assistance !2. The $9.95 help claims that anything not on their interveiw is ""TAX ADVICE""!.. KACHING... GO TO TAX ADVISOR FOR TWENTY FIVE BUCKS.!!YOU HAVE A COUPON TO BOOT.3. Tax Advisor?? Spend half a day awaiting a callback on three occasions and receive the same answer three times ; ""unable to contact client. Try again.OK H&R; block is in the tax prep business...now do you get the picture?"
2,"A great movie, a not so great soundtrack.","This is one of those soundtracks that doesn't capture the feeling of the movie. The music is quite non-descript and annoying at times. Except for a few tracks, I was quite disappointed. Watch and movie and enjoy, but leave it at that. You'll be glad you saved your money."
2,Lacks power - too fast,"While this performance is brilliantly sung and played, the Bach Mass In B Minor demands more than that. Various choruses (e.g. the Gloria, the Sanctus, etc.) require more shear vocal heft than this one voice per part recording can muster. As a result the sense of grandeur that is so glorious in this great work is unfortunately missing. The other choruses seem to work quite well though.Another problem is that often conductors and singers think that faster is often better and that happens in this recording as well. The Gloria and the Cum Sancto Spiritu are sung so fast that the beauty is lost and rather than hearing a spirited and bouncy chorus that absolutely swings, you hear a race to the finish in an attempt (I suppose) to show how expert the singers are in being able to sing it so fast.I find I prefer a recording with larger forces. Consider the Fasolis which only uses about 25 voices but captures the Mass in all its grandeur."
3,Great price but...,"The collection is pretty good. But for me the only one that really value is the Prime 9. Exciting downcount for the best moments of baseball. 9 different countdowns with best hitting seasons, best pitching seasons, the -never-be-broken- records among others. The All century team is good but not superb video, the best 30 players in the 20th century and all of those players with 1 or 2 minutes of them history. But the really bust is the bloopers one. Chat, chat, chat, its like behind the scenes of baseball. how the players have fun, or something like that but the really good bloopers like fielders crash, or the colorful managers are out of the video. In one point the video is so boring."
5,Perfect tool for making scones,"I've used two knives to cut butter into scones and other batters using hard fats for years, but now wonder how I ever did without this wonderful tool. It cuts through even the coldest butter with ease, cleans like a dream, and feels solid and comfortable in my hand. The Oxo product pales in comparison. What a shame this has been discontinued. Was just about to order one each for my sisters. Fine product. If you can find it elsewhere, grab it."
5,My daughter's most used toy,"I got these for my daughter when she was about 4. She's 7 1/2 now, and these blocks have been almost continuously used since we bought them. They are well-made and versatile...and admittedly fun for adults to play with too!They are ""architectures blocks""...I guess meaning they are balanced and weighted well. You can make some very finely balanced and creative structures with these. (As well as elaborate mansions for My Little Ponies!)Definitely worth the money.I wish Kapla would come out with some add-on kits though!"
5,Amazing blocks,"These blocks were recommended by a friend and said they were perfect for all ages. As simple as these blocks are, they are amazing. The types of structures you can build are incredible. Because the blocks are so thin, you can make bridges and towers that seem to defy gravity. Fun for kids and adults alike."
5,Hours of imaginative play,"Got these for my kids because they played with them at a museum recently and couldn't get enough. Blocks couldn't be simpler, but the kids love them, and something about how they're made seems to make them less likely to tip over than other building blocks."
2,Why all the hype?,"Honestly, I'll say it...these are not the funnest blocks in the world. I personally find them frustrating, unforgiving and rather limiting. I don't find that they help to spur the imagination much. Give me and my kids plain old blocks any day, or a nice construction toy like K'nex to play with. These are an okay block if you don't mind precision fidgeting and constructions that fall down like dominoes, I suppose, but neither me or my kids enjoy that."
3,Intimacy with God: An Introduction to Centering Prayer,"Although the concept of Centering Prayer has been around for quite some time, it is new to me. It has given me pause to think about my relationship with God."
4,Stories about the Pacific War.,"A fairly interesting book. O'Donnell lists the campaigns of the elite troops of this theater of command, details the plan of battle, and then gives the oral histories of those who served in those campaigns. Most of the veterans are at the end of their lives, so these oral histories present a heartfelt tribute to the difficulties these soldiers endured during combat. What surprised me most was how these soldiers/veterans got choked up recounting the battles they went through, and the friends they lost. Freedom isn't cheap, and these soldiers are living proof of how America was affected by the battle.This is a good read. Oral histories are good at describing the personal experiences of soldiers, but they don't put perspective on the actual battle campaigns. If one wants to know more about the War in the Pacific, one needs to read a general history, before reading this book."
4,Great stories by world war 2 Pacific veterans,Excellent book on accounts told by veterans who fought in the Pacific during world war 2. They described the reality and horrors of the battles they fought.
3,"Like others, but better.","Like others, O'Donnell feels obliged to synopsize major battles at the beginning of each interview. No need. Anyone who'd read a book like this knows the history. If he'd left out his summarizing, there'd have been more room for the interviews. These are the heart of the book, and why the book is worth reading. And more than most, this book gets closest to what those in combat thought and felt about battle and its aftermath. It was brutal, random, terrifying and left memories and scars that were indelible. Lest we forget,..."
1,Empty Case,"I purchased Little Buddha about a month ago. I just recently opened the DVD case and it was empty. Obviously, this is quite unfortunate. I did not want to purchase Little Buddha because I like the case."
2,"clearly, not for me: Uses exoticism as a crutch","An anti-climactic and empty narrative. Plot, plot, plot, but no character development. I know the story of lord Buddha...what is the point of this movie!? Completely absurd. I truly *wanted* to like this movie, but it gave me no reason to.There ARE some adorable moments, and a well-directed and crafty depiction of one family in India. But these moments are few and far between, and they certainly don't save this movie. Rather one-sided and depends too much on the exoticism of Zen Budhism. Almost fetishistic. Unfortunate, becasue this concept had some potential."
3,"disjointed, but has some beautiful scenes","i cant imagine why Bertolucci made the parents so excrutiatingly difficult to watch-chris isaak's acting was unbearable. the modern day scenes are bad, the other buddha scenes and story i really enjoyed. i could not get past keanu reeves with that wig being siddhartha, just could not, even though he did a fine job. i'd call it an interesting movie, with some enjoyable scenes of enlightenment, but sure seemed very uneven overall."
4,Beautifully documented and filmed,"I loved this movie the first time I watched it many years ago. I learned things about Buddha I didn't know before. I think it is a respectfully filmed story about Siddartha and his transformation into Buddha.Thank you,J. Christensen"
4,Beautiful Contrast of Cultures,"Little Buddha is really two stories that are intertwined. The main part of the story is about a little boy named Jesse who lives in Seattle with his parents. Buddhist monks believe that he may be the reincarnation of their late teacher. They came to his house and present him with a book about Prince Siddharta.As the movie progresses, there are flashbacks as the book is read to Jesse. It tells the story movie of Prince Siddharta and his journey to enlightenment. Siddharta is played by Keanu Reeves. Try as I might, I had a hard time recognizing Keanu. He was lost in his role -- only to be recognized by his eyes. In this role, he shines.Most of Jesse's story takes place overseas in Bhutan, where he meets the other two children that also may be reincarnations of Llam Dorje. Prince Siddharta's story continues to be intertwined with Jesse's story.""Little Buddha"" will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, and also help you to appreciate the Buddhist religion."
1,Wrong Format!,"I placed an order for the widescreen (2.35:1) vesrion, but the shop sent me a letterbox version. It is a total waste of time including returning the item."
4,Beautiful and enlightening,"""Little Buddha"" is two movies in one. The modern day part is well done and is a good primer for anyone interested in learning about Buddhism, but the ancient legend of Buddha is the part worth watching repeatedly. Filmed in mostly golden hues, the cinematography is breathtaking, and the part of Siddhartha/Buddha is played to perfection by Keanu Reeves, who imbues the role with a radiant mixture of wisdom and innocence. I'll be able to view the historical part of this film until the end of my days and not tire of it."
5,Little Buddha Art House DVD,Great visual experience and Keanu Reeves a joy in the role. A true art house movie with out the pretentiousness. An excellent story well told and based on true life experiences.
4,GOOD LITTLE INTRO ABOUT BUDHHA,WHILE REINCARNATION THING WAS NOT SO ATTRACTING KEANU REEV AS BUDHHA HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB. BEST OF ALL SCENES IN THE MOVIE WAS WHEN BUDHHA GETS ENLIGHTENMENT AND BECOMES A NEW AGAIN. I THINK RICHARD BACH HAS EXPLAINED SAME IN HIS BOOK JOHNATHAN LIVINGSTONE...WHEN THE THE SEAGUL BECOMES NEW AGAIN AFTER SO MANY HARDSHIPS.
1,Cheap for a reason,"This set is cheap for a reason - it is made cheaply. Just got it today and assembled it, only to find pieces constantly fall off, it doesn't snap shut for carrying and storage, etc. I know it's inexpensive, but don't bother. I'm returning it without even giving it to my daughters."
3,my niece's gift,"My 5 yr old niece loved it, even though she had one before...According to her you have to be careful with the smaller pieces, because they easily get lost."
4,cute castle,"Cute castle but better suited for polly pocket type princess's, comes with a cute tub etc lights up. my 7yr old loved it. Ive had no problems with anything falling a part works fine. Its small doesnt take up a lot of space bonus."
1,This is just terrible!,"I find this single the worst one Delta released. The Duett Almost Here with the obviously untalented Ex Westlifer is just terrible, lame without inspiration, totally depressing, far from Deltas so beautiful Work, just pathetic. Hollow No More is nearly the same, bit different text etc, but again so terrible, underlining the obvious untalented singing of Brian, wrecking everything as soon as he starts. And that only Delta Solo Turn You away, is just an average Delta song to me, nothing more - Lastly mentioning the video of almost here, its black/white and as inspirationless as almost here is, so sad that Delta let herself down into such terrible songs. Very Sad!"
5,You know what they are.,"I've used plenty of headphones for drumming and blew these off for a while. They do a really fantastic job. I can listen to music, comfortably, and really lay into my kit. I'm very pleased."
4,good for the price,"They cancel out sound just like they say they do and are comfortable. I have to take my glasses off when I use them, but other than that exactly what I thought they'd be when I ordered them."
4,Awsome headphones,These things are awsome! They kill the drums sound down to a low volume and really save your ears from the beating they take without ear plugs. They will enable you to play for hours without making your ears tired and being able to put music thru them is awsome. I used to have to play music ridiclusly loud through my main speaker system. Now i just plug these in to my computer and hear the music clearly and still hear my drums. Definetly a must buy for any drummer.
2,Good Isolation but right ear is blown.,I have had these for 5 months using them regularly in the studio recording drum parts. Isolation is great but durability is crap.
1,Surprisingly bad,"Before buying Vic Virth I was using a combination of shooting range muffs with in-ear phones. If you think it was rather uncomfortable setup you would be right, so I thought any other isolating phones would be better than that. Vic Virth proved me wrong. Not only noise isolation in their phones is nowhere as good, but I'm getting headaches after just 10 minutes of use, while I could easily wear muffs for couple of hours with no particular discomfort. They should have put health hazard warning on them. Another thing, I don't know what materials they used, but your ears feel pretty hot pretty quickly, much more so than in any ear muffs I used before. And finally, though I didn't expect the phones to reproduce the sound on the level of other similar priced ordinary phones, but I must mention that this set sounds similar to one dollar phones you get on a plane."
4,Great deal,Great deal and product! No problems in negociation. The product is realy good and has good price. Fast ship. The head phone realy has good isolation!
1,Terrible,"For the amount they charge they could give you a wire that doesn't short out so easily. I take care of ALL my wires and instrument cables. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for these had I known this...The sound is awesome, but without a functioning wire there nothing more than glorified ear covers."
4,"Work well, but pinch","I got these for noise reduction, barking dogs, loud trucks etc. They work well for that. The only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head. After a time the pinch is bit much. I have a small (7-1/4) hat size too. However, the price was great, and the sound is good. I'm no audiophile, but do play guitar, mando and dulcimer, and for me these phones deliver a good, well rounded sound.One other thing, these headphones are made for the studio, not for outdoor use.So, if you can deal with the pinch, I highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality."
1,Lasted 2 months...,"I bought these to use with an electronic kit. I started using them around the last week of 12/2012. Since then, I have only taken the headphones from where they hang on my kit's stand and placed them on my head for 1-2 hours on a daily basis. There is no stress on any wires, or any part of the headphones for that matter. I put them on today and after about 10 minutes of use, the sound in one of the speakers started breaking up when I played the kick. The volume on the kit has rarely gone above 70%. On all my other headphones, the kit's sound is fine and does not overpower the speakers even at full volume. The Vic Firth headphones however are now busted in one earphone.The other reviews that complain that the headphones do not last are correct. I am bummed because otherwise, they seem like great isolation headphones. I am hoping there is a warranty."
4,Great for live secuences...,"I'm going to be honest... These are great Headphones... Specially for drummers, cause we always have the problem of cannot listen clarity the tracks we're playing...But the sound is not that good. I will not recommend these for Studio Editing...I recommend to use it in studio, as a drummer, for record drums, or play drums live with secuences cause for sure, you will listen the metronome click clear and secure.Otherwise... In professional Studio, in the case of mixing and Edition of HD tracks... This will not help, because sound is flat... designed to take care of your ears.Was a great inversion, but I will use this specially for secuences, and click/drum recording situations."
5,The best so far...,I had a pair of Koss isolation headphones that worked well but the sound quality was rather poor. These headphones are a little too good. I just listened to a lecture and could hear the spit and swallowing of the lecturer. They are also much more comfortable than but still tight on the head.
3,Vintage vibe on these cans...,"These headphones do the job of isolating the external sound. As a drummer they allow my to hear the tunes while playing along with new tunes. However, the framework is difficult to adjust. The wires that adjust for size are very thin and the head pad in top is not very padded. They feel like 1970's stereo headphones. Still a decent product that I would recomend for any ony wanting to play along to music while drumming."
4,Excellent,These headphones are perfect for drum set. They allow you to listen to music while playing. You won't need to turn the music up to a really high decibel level. The only thing that could make them better is to have the quality of music being listened to better. A metronome works great with these headphones. They are a must have for every drum set player.
5,Excellent! Great headphonesphones for great value!,"If you're reading these reviews, you may get the impression that the Vic Firth Headphones are of good quality but may have some issues. So let me tell you my situation. I have a low budget recording operation in the most acoustically hostile environment (a church with no insulation, and concrete floors... AND LOTS AND LOTS OF ECHO!!!). The echo creates circumstances that render conventional headphones useless. In many ways, it amplifies the sound. The Vic Firth headphones cuts out 85% of outside noise. This allows me to make effective and accurate mixes in this facility. This is all you need to know. Buy the headphones!"
5,headphones,I don't think you can go wrong with anything Vic Firth has his name on.You can adjust the position so as to hear more of what your playing. very well made.
2,Is it possible to get a defective product twice in a row?,"This is my second purchase of this product and both failed me after less than 6 months of use. The problem is with the sudden issue with the sound which appear to be due to the wiring just going in to the headphone. Both headphones started having sound issues where the right or left side would start to suddenly be static, sound coming in and out. If I were to hold play with the cable going in to the headphone would relieve the issue but when I let it go. It comes back. Like I said this is the second one I bought, same issue. I don't know if there is a way to open up the headphones to see if there are loose wires, but I don't know how to open without breaking. But I guess since I am throwing these out anyway, I may as well see. Vic Firth is still a good noise cancelling headphone. Its stereo version however, failed for me."
4,pretty good,"These headphones help block out the sound and protect your ears. However, keep in mind that they lessen the sound quality and create pressure in your ears. If these two factors don't bother you, then this is definately a good deal for you."
1,crap,"these things suck, they broke after the third time I used themI don't even have a big head, but these are not flexible AT ALL"
4,Nice toy for little ones,"We got this toy for my 9 mo old daughter. She loves Dora, but all the other Dora dolls have real hair, or at least strands of hair. At 9 mo old, she loves to chew on things, and the hair with this doll is perfect because it's part of the doll and not strands of hair. Excellent for small children. Her eyes light up when you use it as a puppet also."
2,A disappointing debut novel,"After fighting my way through Martin Sketchley's first novel, I can't say I'll be racing to read any of his later offerings. The story definitely showed promise and there were some interesting characters, props and settings but these parts were not woven together into a cohesive whole. The writer spent too long on irrelevant details but then glossed over important material directly relating to the main character's progress and motivations. The reader was expected to simply accept too many key elements that were presented in ways that just didn't make sense. We were told that the protagonist was an elite soldier but very few of his thoughts or actions supported this characterisation and any forward progress he did make seemed more the result of random chance.My advice - don't waste your time"
2,Use with sedentary activity only!,"I bought this product hoping for an alternative to the aluminum based ones normally used. It worked fine for wintertime when I only had desk work to do. However, with any amount of activity I found myself needing a deodorant. I ended up throwing the stone away in search of something different."
5,Excellent product,I haven't been impressed with natural deodorants until I found the Thai Deodorant Stick. It's safe to use and it works!
3,Not amazing,"It worked for the first two to three weeks. Then it stopped. Aruptly. I did the whole ""generous"" spiel, wetting it repeatedly and rubbing it under my arms ALL over, and for some reason it stopped working a week or so ago. I'm pretty upset because I thought this was ""the answer"" and it was going so well, too... it helped me out, but now I'm not sure what to do with it. Does it run out? I did forget to put the top back on a few times, but would that make a difference in ""freshness"" or ""longevity""?Anyway, I'll keep using it, but it won't do any good."
1,I was excited,"This crystal did not work at all for me. I think it might work for someone who is primarily sedentary, but its surely not an athlete friendly product. I am disappointed to say this as I was very excited after seeing all these positive reviews. But hey, maybe I'm just a really smelly guy.Anyway, I'm back to axe!"
4,Great!!,Very good product. I've been using it for a long time and it works great. No white marks. Safe for sensitive skin. I will suggest to improve the package. It may works better with a twist to push up and down.
2,Does Nothing For Me,"This is like using nothing, I feel like I abused my armpits but it does nothing for me.Great idea, and maybe it's made for a woman and the hair stops it from being effective.Maybe it's made for people who just don't ever smell.This crystal did not work at all for me. I think it might work for someone who is primarily sedentary, but its surely not an athlete friendly product. I am disappointed to say this as I was very excited after seeing all these positive reviews. But hey, maybe I'm just a really smelly guy."
5,The Best Ever,"I have been using this product for about 10 years now and will use no other. It works, and contains no chemicals. Even my sweaty, stinky brother uses it when he does yard work and he doesn't smell afterward. Now that is proof that it works. The stone lasts for years (if you don't drop and break it). I love it."
5,Everything it claims and more...,"Unbelievable product. Worth every penny!No dangerous chemicals, animal fats, carcinogens etc. Vegan/Vegetarian Safe. Lasts FOREVER. I stay completely scent free for days from one application even after showers. Works equally well for women and men! No strong artificial scent, only pure natural (aluminum free!) you.Love it."
2,"Overpriced, by a long shot","These crystals do work, but you may notice a bit of a smell at the end of a long day. Not obnoxious, but the way to combat that as some readers have suggested is to do a large area of the underarm repeatedly.The price went up by over $6, shipping is hefty, so at a total of $14 for this item, I am classifying this as a huge rip-off.Walgreens and CVS sell the same deodorant crystals for $5 to $6, so save yourself some money if you are just testing. I bought ""Naturally Fresh"" with Aloe Vera and have been using it successfully for almost a year.Don't be fooled by the Thai or any other label. Mineral crystals are all relatively the same thing."
4,It's nice to know chemicals aren't under my arms.,"This product is a decent product. I don't stink after 2 hours like the other natural deoderants in the stores. You do have to put a little water on the stone whenever you use it though because without water it doesn't work as well to put on. The lifespan on this deoderant is about 2-3 months (I haven't finished mine yet and I bought it in late august). It works, however i'm sure if you look hard enough you will find a similar product that isn't as expensive when you apply shipping."
5,"WORKS GREAT, I CAN WEAR THE SAME SHIRT TWICE!","This product works great!! I had been using Tom's Natural deodorant for years and it suddenly stopped working. The lady at the health food store recommended this and I really like it! I can wear the same shirt twice and there's still no odor in the armpit or the shirt. To apply, I put the ball under water for a couple of seconds, rub the ball under my arm, rinse the ball again, do the other arm, rinse again, put the cap on and set it in the medicine cabinet on a paper towel. No need to rub half way down the arm or scrub the armpit, etc. And seemingly this one container will last a long, long time."
5,I love this stuff!!!,"This deodorant will NOT stop wetness. It will, however, stop odor, and it won't stain your clothes like the sticks and gels and sprays do. It lasts a long long time - my first stone lasted almost 2 years, even though I dropped it and part of it broke off. If that happens to you, and it's too sharp to use, just file down the jagged edges with sandpaper or a nail file. The stone works best if you use it twice a day, morning and night. I recommend this stone to all my friends."
2,WAS NOT EFFECTIVE,"I Purchased the Thai Deodorant Stick for my daughter and it truly did not hold her,her underarms were very smelly and wet"
3,It works okay,"I've tried a number of salt deodorants over the years and I'd have to say this one is about average. It does the trick for about the first half of the day, but then you have to re-apply. Some of the better brands last all day."
1,This made me smell worse than I already do!,"I have used a crystal deoderant stick for the last several years. (That's how long one stick lasted!) I'm now down to a few little pieces of the original, and don't remember which brand I bought.I assumed they were all alike, and bought the 'Thai Crystal' stick, which was definitely not the one I bought previously.The Thai product actually makes me smell worse! (Actually, 'stink' would not be too big a stretch.)It sounds like others have been very happy with this product, so it may be something odd about me. And because I so loved my prior crystal, I'm going to try another brand..."
1,So sad!,"The crystal deodorant worked amazingly for a week or two, but then I started to get stinky very quickly.*sigh* I was so hopeful that a natural deodorant would work for me, but my quest still continues."
1,"Waste of Money , did not work for me",This did not work for me at all . I am disappointed and was excited to try after seeing all the positive reviews. baking soda and coconut oil worked better for me than this .
1,Not What It Seems,"I used to use this product because I thought that it was safe. Well, I did some research into it and found that this is aluminum in it's truest form. I was quite surprised to learn that this product is aluminum under a different name. This is bauxite and bauxite is the raw state of aluminum. Since that is so, we are still using aluminum. I emailed the company almost a month ago and have not heard a thing from them. I wish I had known sooner.Update:Dr. Mercola had this review 2-16-2010. [...]And I still have not heard from the company about this issue."
5,Thai Stick Deoderant,"When I first opened I noticed it didn't look like the image provided which worried me a bit, but after trying it out that isn't a big deal anymore. It truly meets all it's advertised promises: Unscented, no greasy feeling, does not stain clothes, and though it did not mention this, I do notice that I sweat less during my daily activities. I have not tried any rigorous exersize with it though. One thing to remember: apply liberally."
1,Absolutely ineffective,"So far, I've been very disappointed by this deodorant stone. For me, it completely fails to perform its advertised task. It doesn't matter how much time I spend slathering it around in my nether-regions; I smell horrible. I had just run out of my conventional deodorant, and put my entire faith in this magical Thai crystal as I endured one stinking week waiting for it to arrive. Oh well, maybe I can find some other uses for it. Definitely gonna have to 1-star this one. What a shame."
2,"good, but be careful","So far I'm satisfied about the way that protect me against bad smell. What I don't like about this product is that on ingredients states 'mineral salt'. That's it. So, you don't know what ingredients are included. Are you sure that all 'mineral salt' are good for your body? I'm sorry, but I can not recommended."
1,got ripped off paid for 2 got 1,"BE CARFULL WHEN BUYING,I PAID FOR A 2 PACK AND ONLY RECIEVED 1.I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT THEM TO GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO FIX IT BUT SINCE THEY ALREADY GOT THEIR MONEY THEY DON'T CARE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.SO BE CAREFULL WHEN BUYING YOU MAY NOT GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR.YOUR'S TRULEY RIPPED OFF AGAIN."
4,Odd-ball Erudite Grab-bag,"Imagine a Victorian Robert Graves who, akin to the method used in Goodbye to All of That, decided to write an eccentric autobiography stuffed to the brim with crumbling family manses, ghosts, family eccentrics (the biggest being the author) and upper-crust cocktail chatter--that's Hare. He's the seedy gentleman bachelor who is definitely from the same cast as Oscar Wilde (minus the wife and two children). Apparently, Hare was originally known for his travel writings but now all that's left of him is just this one (extremely entertaining) autobiography. If one enjoyed the structure of Goodbye to All of That, this book will definitely be a treat."
2,Just an Overview,"This book is simply an overview of the sport of falconry. It is meant only to introduce the reader to the sport and prepare him for the amount of dedication owning a falcon will require. I also believe the book is designed to dissuade the person with only casual interest from entering the sport.There is very little practical ""How-To"" information in this book.No training specifics. No care specifics.Save yourself 20 dollars... A magazine or Website on falconry would be a better place to find the kind of information this book offers."
1,falconry for beginners is useless.,"It doesn't talk about falconry at all. It only says how falconry is not for you and shows you a couple of pictures of the equipment use in falconry. It was a very boring book with nothing interesting or helpful. It doesn't mention training, manning, trapping or anything which could possibly be usefull. I recommend falconry and hawking which was very good, but this book was horrible"
3,Basic Book,"As the title says, it is a basic book about Boilers.For beginners in this field the book is recommended."
1,Look elsewhere for marketing expertise,"If you are looking for a detailed marketing book, look elsewhere. Many of the topics are given a superficial view and when the author attempts to provide any depth, he just creates confusion with buzzwords and jargon. Many topics have little substance to support the authors position. The templates are poorly structured as well and there are too many tables with irrelevant data. On top of all this, the book is out of date. I wish I could my $39 back in addition to the hours wasted reading through this ""textbook""."
1,Poorly written,"I can't believe I paid money for this! It reads narratively, like a personal diary rather than the textbook style I expected. This book has loads of tables and is poorly laid out on the pages. No offense to Dr. Sirsi on getting his thesis listed on Amazon for sale, but this is not a handy manual or a detailed desk reference guide. Save your money, and buy something new that Al Ries has published!"
5,Excellent Service,The service was excellent. I received the book extremely fast. The book was as it was described.No surprises. I was very pleased with my first experience on Amazon.
2,Only interested in 3 cards,"This is not one of my favorite Titania products - I love her Oracle and the Fortune Cards. But with this product I only found 3 cards that are (1) practical for me, (2) ingredients are easy to get; and (3) spells I might be inclined to use. However, it is beautifully packaged."
3,There are simple idioms missing!,"This dictionary is very good, especialy because it also includes phrasal verbs, which Longman American Idioms Dictionary doesn't have, but it could have more examples for every idiom, but what it is most urgent in an eventual up-to-date version is to SIMPLE idioms such as listen up, blow up = explode, my bad = my fault, etc. to be included."
4,Love it!!,"I own all the DDR games for xbox and this one's probably my 3rd fav. Im my opinion there needs to be more j-pop cuz i love japanese music. xD And more songs with some bass. But the songs r okay, theyre better on the other games. But the packaging was great. It was used but like new as said."
3,never could even play it,"DOESN'T WORK ON XBOX360...WHICH IT DID NOT STATE WHEN WE BOUGHT IT =( WE REALLY WANTED TO TRY THIS OUT BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE A LOT OF FUN, VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY XBOX360."
3,Ok game,I like the game but some of the songs i don't like. I got tired of it pretty quick but thats probably just me.
2,Seasoned DDR Vet,"I have been playing DDR for a couple of yearsw now, I can pass pretty much all songs on Maniac (heavy mode) With the exception of Max(period) I'm not going to go into ""ohhhh lol lol this game is so much fun rofl and it's a good workout lmao."" I don't care. The song selection sucks. YOu have to pay like 5 bucks to download all the good songs, like Sakura, Heaven is a 57' Metallic Grey, .59 remix, ect.... It dosen't have the classics I've been yearning for. A good thing, It does have a MAX 300 remix that's a 10 footer. Another flaw, It's missing Oni Mode. The lack of PSMO makes it very under par."
3,"Nice idea, but...","I thought this was a great idea and bought with high hopes. I think the product might work well with little babes, but my 18-month-old just takes whatever I've chosen to use as a bib and pulls it out of the clips. They're surprisingly weak. Thus, if you have a cooperative, uninquisitive toddler, they might be OK, but for my girl, they're just not going to work. I still think they'd have been OK for her when she was first starting, though."
2,"Good idea, bad design","I really liked the idea of being able to turn an ordinary napkin or towel into a bib. However, the ""strings"" that go around the neck are a stiff rubber like material and it will not lay flat around the neck and down the back. Therefore, whenever my son leans back in his high-chair the ""strings"" poke the seat or his head. It bothers him so much that he pulls it off. And since the clips are not very strong, the towel or cloth comes right off. I sent this product back."
4,Good Idea,"I love that i have this product with me at all times. A bib is better, but I hated finding dirty ones in the bottom of my diaper bag. My daughter seems uncomfortable in it, but it gets the job done and her shirt stays clean."
5,I love Kipiis!,"These Bib Clips are such a wonderful idea. I give them to every expectant mother I know - great way to round out a shower gift. Keep one in your diaper bag, glove box, kitchen drawer - you'll use them all the time."
2,"Cute, but.......","They look cute. But. String are very stiff. They are sticking out behind the neck and does bother my 20 months old daughter and distract her while she is supposed to eat her meal.Clips.... very hard to use, too shallow maybe, don't grip much. My daughter enjoy pulling off napkin.Very disappointed."
2,Great Idea But Needs Rework,"I love the concept but the implementation does not work well. It is uncomfortable for the kids, so they tend to take it off. I bought these for our European trip: One for my 6-months-old baby and the other for my 5-year-old son. However, I found the strings/wires to be rather inflexible and the two yellow clips not being able to take a strong grip of the napkins. Thus, I was disappointed with the purchase. I tried but did not use it with my baby. My older son used it a couple of times, because I insisted. I would like to see the strings to be made of material like shoe laces and the clips to be able to hold onto more area of a napkin."
3,seems like a good idea but it doesn't really work - and expensive!,"yes the clips hold onto the napkin, but what napkin? if its a paper napkin all the moisture go right through to your child's clothes, not to mention that the paper napkin will probably be shredded within seconds of being clipped onto your toddler child -even if you have an older child with a cloth napkin, the moisture still goes through, as does some of the tomato sauce color, which ruins white clothes.this product is ok for the older child, but then the older child can probably just eat with a napkin in his/her lap."
3,Great idea but baby has other plans,This product is great in theory. My 10 month old is a bib ripper though. We attached the kipiis to a paper napkin at a restaurant and it was off in 2 seconds flat. We actually started laughing as did most of the tables around us as once my little guy figured out he could rip it off he did so with great delight. We ended up rummaging through the diaper bag for a regular bib after going through a few paper napkins.I've since bought some plain white washcloths to keep in the diaper bag to use with the kipiis. Until our little guy is old enough to understand he can't rip his bib off this won't serve it's true purpose for us.
2,good in theory but not in practice,my 14 month old could easily remove the bib from the clip within seconds. I had to return it.
5,Brilliant and insightful,"I read the first few paragraphs of this book to my husband and he said ""Bingo"". Mr. Gatto eloquently expresses that which we have unconciously known about public compulsory schooling but were unwilling or unable to admit. He weaves his opinions through a series of essays with different angles on the subject from the history of our school system to the cost of schooling. He points out the ugly truth that no amount of money is going to fix a system that is beyond repair, something the politically motivated NEA can't seem to accept. We are all addicted to compulsory schooling and the cure will be very painful."
3,An axe to grind,"At first glance, Gatto's book gives the reader a sense that we should pack up our children and remove them from public schools, but when one truely reads the book, you tend to feel that Gatto has an axe to grind with public school education. Some of his suggestions are interesting, but I found most of his comments, thoughts, and suggestions were not supported in the book. I feel his general tone of the book suggests that we as teachers and parents should instill a sense of defiance in our children. I am curious as to why he stayed in the public school education system for over thirty years if he disliked it so much."
2,Cause and effect?,"John Gatto has many significant and true things to say about education, but he confuses cause and effect. The cause of many of the problems he mentions often is not the school or the teacher, but society and its demands. The movement to destroy the public school system is part of the attempt to create a stratified society, because the more uneducated people you have out there, the less the wealth will be evenly distributed."
5,Every parent must read this book,"Gatto's writings are not an easy read. His style is intellectual and his vocabulary and phraseology will cause some to put this book down before finishing. Stay the course! Here is the one man I know of who has paid the price to speak to modern-day parents about sending their children to school so a stranger can raise them to become shallow and vulnerable human beings whose wills have been turned over to the marketers of the world. After homeschooling my own sons, I now substitute teach in the very grades Gatto once taught and I know, firsthand, the truths of which he speaks. After reading this work, turn to John's latest, and most profound offer: ""Weapons of Mass Instruction""."
4,Fun Combat Flight Sim,"Expanding on their successful F-14 combat simulator, Majesco moves you into the seat of the F/A-18F Super Hornet. If you have played F-14, than you will be at home with this 2nd offering. This is not an arcade style action game, it is a basic combat flight simulator similar in concept to what you would find at a Naval Air Station to train combat pilots. Flying from a carrier in the NAG and land bases near Iraq, you are a tasked with enforcing UN Resolutions to drive Saddam from power. While the storyline is now somewhat dated, and in hindsight historically inaccurate...the game play itself is a good way to fill a few empty minutes. I keep a copy of this, and F-14 in my flight bag to fill occasional downtime."
2,Don't Buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is very boring and poorly created. They could have made the game a little better by setting it up different. There are also bad graphics. Don't bye!...I repeat....DON""T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,I'd like to know,"I've seen The Wallace Collection in my country in the 70's. A great band. The drumer was the lead vocals and the song ""Daydream"" is one the most beautiful song I've ever heard.We don't have this CD in Brazil and I'd like to know if this song ""Daydream"" is in this CD. Thanks. Raul."
1,Bad copies,"The copies I received for The Little Drummer Boy were very bad quality. Very disappointed, but may that is why they were so cheap."
5,A Christmas Classic,"This is such a wonderful Christmas video for the family. While it may seem that the little drummer boy hates everyone, it's not true. He's just upset that his parents were killed and he's an orphan. But he learns in the end that not everyone is bad, and learns to love people. It's a great movie with great morals.This is a must have video especially for Christmas."
5,One Of My Favorite Rankin and Bass Christmas Specials!,This is one of my favorite Rankin and Bass Claymation Christmas specials! I first watched The Little Drummer Boy when I was little and I love it and think it's a very inspirational story!
3,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled, this is the original unremastered version. My daughter loves that version so it's great, but I could have bought it from Wal-Mart for half this price."
5,When are we going to get a decent print of this?!,"When I heard that the Little Drummer Boy was once again going to be re-released on DVD I was ecstatic since I thought we'd finally get a trluy restored version to replace my old DVD which had the picture quality of a worn out VHS tape. But, once again, we're given a sub-par print with dark, grainy imagery and scratches. This is nothing more than the same repackaged junk that already existed! I understand it's quite possible that no better prints exist, but if that's the case then the state of affairs on this terribly neglected classic is even grimmer than imagined. Own it if you've no other choice but this is a shame. I give it a 5 for content and less than zero for quality."
2,Little Drummer Boy,I found this video to be of poor quality. Very hazy. For the price it is a nice addition to the video library.
4,One the classics that's missing from these claymation original Christmas Set,"This story apparently can't make it past the politically correct sensors of today, where free speech isn't so free. It doesn't exactly pass judgement on any religions or races, but it does make clear distinctions of various peoples who most certainly lived in the time and place of this story.Reality and Diversity are being sacrificed for PC."
4,very sweet movie,"The movie is as good as I remember from my childhood but unfortunately the quality of the reproduction is very poor. My mother-in-law happens to have a copy of it on VHS that must have been made before the producers lost the 35mm original, because her VHS reproduction is much clearer than what's on my DVD. It's a real pity the 35mm was lost because it makes a big difference to watch it with the original quality. I imagine if someone redid the story from scratch it would be saccharine and puerile just like all the christmas movies made these days.Anyway, as far as I can tell from searching for this item on other sites, this DVD is as good a copy as anyone is going to be able to find."
1,Disturbing,"I can honestly say that this is my least favorite holiday movie. As a child I remember being very upset by the images of Aaron losing his parents, being kidnapped and almost losing his sheep BaaBaa. The best part of this movie is Aaron playing for baby Jesus and regaining his trust in people again otherwise, make sure you have a box of tissues when viewing this movie."
1,Don't even think about letting kids see this,"It horrified me as a kid. I still can't listen to the song, to this day, some 30 years later. There are several scenes that are just too much for children. There is a scene where the boy actually watches his parents BURN to death in the house, and another where a lamb is run over by a charriot. What a nightmare. I'm just grateful they don't play it on tv anymore."
4,SDK purchse of Little Drummer Boy,Product was delivered as promised in new condition and via courier I could track the shipment to ensure it would arrive before Christmas.
5,Little Drummer Boy,Great DVD. One that I remember from my childhood and now I can share it with other kids in this day and age.
1,Nothing but problems,"I've had around 10 computers, and this is the worst by far. Out of the box, networking didn't work until Customer Support applied some weird BIOS patch. The video card's gone out... TWICE. HP's customer support application got into such a broken state that it can't even be uninstalled. The eject button sticks -- I have to press *really* hard, in exactly the right spot. I really, really wish I had gotten something, anything else."
1,Remote control,"It ""worked"" for the first three days with our Christmas miniature outdoor lights before it faild completely. Sometimes we would have to get the remote to withen three feet of the receiver before it would work."
4,Wireless Remote Power Outlet,"Works as it suggests, pretty useful remotely controlled power outlet. I use for an attic based wifi router that occasionally needs to be re-started, this works great for just that."
4,Works great through wall and door!!,"I was skeptical at first because i didn't see any reviews concerning obstructions such as walls and doors. This device works well through walls and doors. From the bottom floor i am able to turn on/off my internet equipment upstairs, with door closed.NOTE: sometimes the remote came with the cover screw twisted too tight, causing the remote not to work. just loosen the screw a little and it will work just fine. I want to say that because someone complains about remote didn't work. Overall, IT'S GREAT."
1,Poor product,I bought this remote to turn on a waterfall about 20ft away. It worked for about 3 months until the temp was below 50 degrees F. I ended up buying another unit to see if it would work and this one does'nt even work until you are 3 ft in front of it and that is at 70 degree F. I would not recomend this item to anyone.Northern California
1,Don't waste your money,"I had high hopes for this product since I was using it in close range (less than 10 feet). The product was unreliable, only worked about 25% of the time for a week and then stopped working all together. Tried swapping batteries, nothing."
1,Doesn't work,"It DOESN'T work - PERIOD.Terrible - I bought 3. Returning them all. Totally useless.One light wouldn't turn on AT ALL. The other only if less then a foot away, and still only rarely.Recommend:Skylink WS-100 Wireless Remote Control (CH A or B)"
2,If I knew then what I know now,"I purchased two of these.First one never worked so, thought the best cure was to buy another.Second one worked momentarily and then stopped. Wrote to the company and after a good deal of time (and some trickery), was able to get them both repaired and returned. Only use it on simple stuff (low wattage). Wanted to use it in my woodworking shop (namely my vacuum system). Afraid to. Currently use one inside (on a radio) and one outside (on a heating pad in the cat's box) with no problem but I don't think they are worth the money nor the effort especially since they are so prone to breakage."
5,Wireless Remote Control Outdoor Power Outlet,I recently purchased the Wireless Remote Control WRC101 on Amazon to operate my outdoor fountain from inside my house. It was easy to install and works perfectly! I'm a satisfied customer! Toni
2,Worked Fine...for a few months!,"I purchased this unit for inside use. Construction appears fine; unit worked fine - for 5 months. Now the remote control does not send signal with use of ON button, only OFF. Trying a different brand."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I AM UNABLE TO CONTROL THE UNIT THROUGH THE WALL AS STATED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT, ONLY THE WINDOW. I HAVE TO TAPE THE REMOTE CONTROL BATTERY COMPARTMENT DOOR ONTO THE REMOTE CONTROL, THE CLIP WILL NOT HOLD IT CLOSED."
2,Bought 2 SVAT WRC101's but 1 was defective,I bought 2 but one was defective and returned for credit. Both remotes triggered the good unit so I assume both are the same frequency.
4,Cheap and works well !,"Looks and feels like it's made China (which it is), but functions well. I have been using the remote switch everyday and it works ... turning on a 1000 watt space heater and light from the comfort of my bed .. good value for the money ! Can't get to excited about a switch !"
2,No Good,Bought this item to use out doors as it said it was for out doors and it would not work in he cold but would work in the house. So could not use it on our Christmas lights outside as we intended on doing. Won't buy another one.
3,Remote Stopped Working After a Week- Batteries?,Had it on the Xmas tree as it was hard to get to the plug. It stopped working with the remote. It is probably the battery but it was only hooked up a week- not good.
3,"Works good, however","The remote switch works just as advertised. Very handy item.However the battery door on the remote will not stay on.Poorly made. I just taped it, no big deal. That is why I gave ita 3 rating. Delivery was very prompt. Thanks, Billy."
4,Wireless Remote Outlet Control Works Great,"When I recently purchased an outdoor fountain, I wanted a way to turn it on and off without making a trip out to our garage. I did a search on the interent for wireless remote outlet controls and found this product. It works great. It has a range of at least 25 feet - and works through glass and wall board. During the winter, when the fountain was no longer operable, I brought the remote inside to operate our Christmas tree lights! I love it, and my wife loves it too!"
2,unreliable,the off switch works well enough but to switch it on takes several attempts. still trying to understand how to hold it or how to direct the remote to get a good signal to switch on.
1,Only work indoor,This product is claimed to work outdoor. But it didn't work well outdoor during the Christmas season.
2,So So,I use this to turn on and off a garbage disposal.Turns on the disposal every single time from upto 20' away. Does a very poor job at tuning it off. I have to press the off button several time before it responds. I can live with the inconvenience.
5,So far so good,I have been using this product everyday since I got it from Amazon. It's been working great. I am using it indoors not outdoors. The only thing I think other people might want to know is that the power outlet is pretty big. It is not a problem for me because I hide it so I can't see it.
1,Did not work properly,Tried to use it for my outside lights. It would not turn on or off from inside the house. I had to go about two feet away to make it work. Stay away from this product. I bought a timer switch at walmart works great. less money.
5,Excellent product,The WRC101 exterior remote and it works like a charm. It is connected to my pond outdoor light and it can easily be turned on and off from inside my home with the remote. I adjusted the angle of the receiver (hung on a tree by the pond) so that the transmitter transmission would be received and the light would go on and off from inside my home.
1,Stopped working for no reason,"This product worked great for about 1 month and then just stopped working for no clear reason. Apparently, the return window is only 30 days which is a bunch of crap. I wouldn't buy this product or any other product made by this company."
2,Good for about 6 months,They claim for use outdoors. What they didn't tell you is it's not very water proof.
2,GOOD IDEA LIMITED RANGE,The product is a good concept but lacks the range and needs a clear line of sight from the transmitter to the receiver.
1,bad product,"the first one i installed would only wor from about 10 ft, with new batteries. the second one did not work at all, so i returned items for a full refund thanks to amazon."
2,Worked fine .. for about three months.,"This product worked as described (for a few months), but began to be ""intermittent"", then fully quit working. I tried new batteries, etc. Do not recall, but suppose it was out of warranty, so ... I'm here to buy another brand! :-"
5,it works great,I was impressed it works great. i use it to control equipment about 100 feet away from inside my home. So for me a great buy.
3,Wireless Remote Power Outlet - just O.K.,"This kinda works O.K. ... not as responsive as I expected. If you don't mind a little bit of fiddling with it to get it to work, it is O.K.."
3,Lack's Distance,I tried 2 of these units outside and the range of both units was a maximum of 50'. I find that an override switch on plug unit to turn the plug on & off at the plug would really be a plus. I bought 5 for presents and all worked except the one I kept for myself.
3,Not for cold outdoors,I bought this for a light in my unheated garage. The temps are at 32 degrees and it won't work but when I bring it into the house it works fine. Nice product if your plans are to use it in warmer temps.
1,Didn't work outdoors for more than a week,"The front of the unit states ""OUTDOOR"" but the back of the unit states that it is not for use where directly exposed to water. Well I don't know about the rest of you, but it rains in my outdoors.The unit only worked for about a week outside, then it died and I can't get it to work anymore.Not recommended."
1,DOA,This products was DOA for me. Hopefully other people had better luck. I never did get around to returning it. Shipping is probably half the cost of the product so not really worth my time.
5,Works as advertised!,"So far this item has been great for me. Used it to set up my outside Christmas lights. The power outlet is in a very inconvenient place that I would not want to have to crawl under my patio to get to just to turn the Christmas lights on and off. This item is working excellently, even through my walls and windows. Couldn't be happier!"
3,"Item is fine, Idoits that package it are idiots",They come with two channels for the remote control A and B. I ordered two and they sent me two B's. A little common sense here please....
5,JET - Rare Tracks,"Let's face it, if you're on this page then you're a big fan of JET. So far, I personally have been more impressed with their early efforts (Shaka Rock is good but it departs from the sound JET started out with...).Rare Tracks, as has already been brought out, is an excellent middle piece between Get Born and Shine On. Even though the songs are demo versions, they still sound excellent. The songs that are new on this album really show JET can rock without losing the meaning to their music. JET had a great start, and an equally excellent sophomore release. Personally, I'm hoping their next release will be more like how they started. Heck, if they had something as good as Rare Tracks, I'd be happy. This is definitely a good addition to anyone's JET collection. I'd recommend it to everyone who loves rockin' out to the loud guitars and screaming vocals of JET!"
4,Decent Rare Tracks,"I'm not much of an indepth reviewer but I will say that this collection is worth going after if you are a Jet completist. Disc earned a 4 star rating due to the videos included, otherwise it would have been a 3."
1,Too small,"This puzzle was to be used by a person who has had a hemorrhagic stroke. The puzzle is too small; the pieces are too small. This puzzle or something similar could be purchased at our local dollar store. However, the subject of the puzzle was nostalgic and with great beauty; reminiscent of Vermont/Massachusetts."
2,An expensive reprint,"This (text)book is difficult to understand -not just because of many typos and grammatical errors. The content summarises the concepts introduced in Goldratt's novels. Half the book looks like a reprint of The Goal -and yet Goldratt recommends on more than one occasions to re-read the novel.... I enjoyed the novels, but this book looks more like a marketing gag for Goldratt's seminars or the journal he writes, publishes and sells."
2,How much repetition and advertisement do we need to pay for?,"After reading this book I felt that I paid some good money for repetition, advertisement and teaching of how to get your company to send you to do some course work. This is not what I was looking for."
5,I LOVE IT!!,"OMG! I bought this song off iTunes and almost all of the other My Chemical Romance songs ever and they all rock! I love MCR! You should definitely buy this song. I also recommend Panic at the Disco, Fall Out Boy, Simple Plan, the Used, Switchfoot, Foo Fighters, the Veronicas, and Greeen Day 'cause they all rock!"
1,LOLZ THIZ CD DOESNT MAKE ME WANNA RIP OUT MY EARS AT ALL!!!!!! LOLZ!!!!!,LOL I LOVE THIS CD LOL I LISTEN TO IT IN MY JETTA WHILE DRIVING TO THE MALL LOL I LOL LOVE LOL MCR LOL
5,Her Most Brilliant Album,"This Is Reba's Masterpiece, every song is brilliant and you never get tired of listening to the album."
5,Reba did it again!,"What a Great album. I am a Reba fan and have been for several years. I own ALL of her albums, yes all of them, even those hard to find Mercury Records on Vinyl. ANd this one is my favorite. There are so many different emotions, and Reba's delightful voice will take you on an incredible journey: If you don't already own it, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I AGREE WITH THE NAYSAYERS....,"Well, I didn't let the negative reviews stop me from ordering this CD because I really like Reba McEntire. However, I should have paid attention to the negative reviews. Reba may be a good singer and she is. But the material on this CD has got to be some of the worst I have ever heard. The first song nearly made me want to croak and it hardly got better from that point. Even a good singer like Reba cannot make bad material sound good. Reba's voice is good. Her choice of material (especially on this CD) is not! I'm sorry I bought this."
1,"SHE'S DONE WORSE, BUT THEN SHE'S DONE BETTER TOO!","When a CD has three or four songs on it that stand out but the rest just take up the space, its just not worth it. Such is the sad case here. This one has to rank at the bottom of the pile of Reba product. I wouldn't say it was her worst (IF YOU SEE HIM is the worst of REBA IMO) but its definitely not her best. If you want the best of Reba try ""For My Broken Heart"" or ""So Good Together"". Those are excellent. Or anything before 1988."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TALENT,"From the mid nineties on, Reba channeled her musical energy into a more contemporary sound. This is just noise as far as I'm concerned. A couple of the cuts are o.k. I like ""Till You Love Me"" and ""Read My Mind"". ""She Thinks His Name was John"" is a fine testament and a good story song. But the rest is just more of her contemporary pop styling with loud noises and that terrible habit she has of extending her phrases into multi-syllables. Someone should tell her that it is annoying to hear her sing like that. She doesn't over-do that on her early stuff."
5,GO REBA!,This CD won the BEST COUNTRY ALBUM award at the American Music Awards and it's NO WONDER! The CD also helped Reba win Entertainer of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards! You couldn't ask for a better country album! It's perfect from start to finish! It's gone on to sell over 3 million copies and has become one of the best country records produced in the '90s!
1,REBA IS NOT COUNTRY ON THIS CD!!,Reba is not country anymore period!! This CD will prove that. Just listen to the first track which I think is horrible. As a matter of fact I think the whole CD is horrible. Not deserving of Reba's talent.
1,"BORING, BORING, BONG!!!","Let's gong this one folks. It is one of the worst collections of songs I've ever heard. Most of them need to go into the recycle bin. The arrangements are loud and left my ears going ""Bong""...especially the first song!! The ballads are dull except for ""Till You Love Me"". You can forget this one!"
1,"LOUD, LOUD, LOUD!!","If you want loud...this is the album for you. ""Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" is a good example of overproduction in vocals and arrangements. There is one good song on here and that is ""Till You Love Me"". ""She THinks HIs Name Was John"" means well, it is well intended and all but it still lacks something...can't put my finger on....but it is something. Only for die-hard McEntire fans."
1,ONE OF REBA'S LEAST PALATABLE ALBUMS,"As are most of the albums she recorded in the 1990s, this one is subpar, at least by my standards. Such mediocrity is indeed rewarded though by people who like their country music laced with over instrumentation, loud background vocals and gimmickry galore. The songs, well, lets just say that you won't find anything on here which compares to ""Somebody Should Leave"" from Reba's ""My Kind of Country"" or ""Have I Got a Deal for You"" the title track from her 1995 LP. This one went directly to the Used CD place for a trade in on a Patty Loveless CD. There is real country!!"
1,CONTEMPORARY STYLINGS ARE NOT REBA,"I do like ""Till You Love Me"" but it is mediocre when you look at it against the standard she set on her traditional stuff. This album in a whole is a contemporary output for Miss McEntire and this clearly, as this album indicates is NOT her forte!!"
1,I DIDN'T LIKE THIS ONE AT ALL..............,"Recorded at a time when Reba wanted to expand her horizons with contemporary material, she compromises what makes her so appealing...her down home country earthiness. She ventures into controversial territory here with ""She THinks His Name Was John"", her anthem to Aids Awareness. The song is o.k. but it hardly compares to the singles she recorded and released before her ""contemporary"" phase. The rest of the CD is lackluster and fails to make an impression on me."
1,Maybe She Let Her Big Hair Get in the Way,"Maybe Reba let her big head (eh, hair) get in the way of her perspective for picking out good material because there is only one good song in the bunch here and that is ""Til You Love Me"". You can have the rest!"
1,Ye Gads!!!!,"Suppose one wants to be the best that they can be in whatever arena of life one happens to be in?? If this is the case for Reba, and if I know that redhead, she desires ONLY the best. Which is why I can't figure out why she recorded such mediocre songs on this project. I sense a downward trend in her music with this release. If she wants to transcend all types of music she's going about it the wrong way. There is absolutely Nothing here to justify my giving it a higher than a one-star review. Didn't like this at all!!"
5,Reba-Music,CD arrived in good condition and in a reasonable lenght of time. Would buy from this seller again.
5,Wonderful,"This really is a wonderful album. When one considers that Reba has been around since the mid seventies (albeit initially unsuccesfully) this is a searing indictment to her ability to constantly adapt her talents. This album delivers a great compilation of soul, warm and tender ballads, and upbeat dance tunes - whilst remaining throughout unmistakingly Reba. The only reason I gave this album 5 stars is that I couldn't give it 6!. Do yourself a favour - BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY"
1,"ANOTHER ""MISS"".................","What attracts me to a song? The melody!! The arrangements here for poor material are even worse! Sadly, most of Reba's 90s material is lackluster because she compromised herself so badly! This was another ""miss"" in a long line of ""misses"". The only good song on here was ""Till You Love Me""...but One good song a good CD does not make. This one misses the mark on all counts!"
1,TREMENDOUSLY OVERRATED,"Reba McEntire is so overrated it is ridiculous. Only ""She Thinks His Name Was John"" and ""Till You Love Me"" are worth it here. The rest of this CD is just filler! Buy her traditional stuff of the 1980s instead or the brilliant ""For My Broken Heart"", but forget this mess!!"
5,IN A WORD . . . WOW!,"I have been honored twice. First by taking Darlene's classes. And second, by reading her books. Not only is she incredibly dynamic in a room full of knowledge hungry people, she has also found a way to transfer that excitement to the written word. For anyone in the investment community, this is a must read. I can't wait to take her next class and read her next book. Darlene, keep them coming!"
5,Good book on playing stock splits,"Most people are ware of stock splits, but how many people know how to play them properly?This book picks up where Wade Cook leaves off in WSMM#1 and WSMM#2-Stock market Miracles.I like the fact that the Nelson's explain NOT to play all stocks just because they are going to exercise a stock split. Rather, they explain how to find the best stocks and trade them successfully.I made and continue to make continous cash flow just by playing splits and rolling stocks.Other books I recommend are WSMM#1 and WSMM#2-Stock MArket Miracles and WSMM #4 and Rolling Stocks.Ignore the naysayer. Obviously he hasn't read ot tried the advice. His loss!"
5,More than stock Splitz,"This book covers far more than stock splits. It teaches you how to take advantage of defined events to earn profits. It is a well written, funny, easy to read book. Get one for you and a second for your broker, plus this book makes a great gift."
2,Repetitive,I have to agree with the reviews that found this book to have a LOT of repetition. I agree that everything in the book could have been covered in 25 pages. A large portion of the book is not even spent on stock splits. Although there was some good information it was not specfic to the title. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Hype,"The book might have been worth it if its authors had concentrated the text on the title: stock splits. It contains so much on options that someone not interested in speculating could be put off. Another point that could put an aspiring investor off is the declaration of the authors that they had made money in multi-level marketing. What is the relevance here? They could have been silent on this. Had their entire wealth been founded on investing, then this would have been a good story to tell."
2,Threaded adapter replacement,"after about 10 cuts on 1 1/2"" sch.40 aluminum pipe the threaded adapter broke into the hole saw and I had to purcgase an after market replacement threaded adapter because I didn't have time to wait for an replacment part to be shipped to me. The job had to go on as scheduled"
2,"Nice idea, but ...","This is a SF novel with a feminist touch. I like the idea very much: though it' is not really orginal to separae genders and let each go their own way. But the author did not manage to write the story good enough to be intrigued. Even more, I did not fid out, what the story is. What t s aimed at? It has no real ending, i.e. no solution of the plot.It takes a very long start - the author overdoes the world building at the beginning. The middle part is rather good, and then she screws up the end: a very long aftermath. I think, that's because she tried to find a way to put a happy end, though it's a tragedy. The story beter end with Tritch going mad.That would have been logical."
2,Tritcheon Hash,"I normally love sci-fi stuff, but something about this story just didn't click with me. I struggled through the early chapters, because I just didn't care about Tritcheon as a character. It wasn't until her recon trip to earth, that I stopped having to force myself to finish the chapters, but I still wasn't truly invested in the story. Most books of this length, I will knock out in 1 or 2 days, yet it took me 2 weeks to finish this one. It wasn't awful enough to abandon without finishing, but I won't be re-reading it, ever."
5,Hilarious Sci-Fi Comedy,"This book is a blast. Its a hilarious, definitely feminine perspective on how things could go in a future society about 1000 years in the future when women get tired of us annoying men that dont learn how to behave. The take on how men and women go from the point of women saying ""we're done"" is hilarious. The jokes and humor in the story are awesome, the setting is great, even the names of some of the items are funny. Although as a male, I dont think I'd want to be on either planet, I know of course which planet I'd have to choose to live on, just that I would be kicked out.It would be interesting to see a sequel covering what was alluded to in the last half of the book as well as to see how well we men do. We can behave! Promise!For the record, I do not condone tortue by Ted Nugent..."
5,Tritcheon Hash--CAPTIVATING SCI-FI WIT,"Tritcheon Hash is an enjoyable, satirical romp through a Sci-Fi universe. With a keen and humorous eye for the foibles of Sci-Fi, Sue milks a number of sacred, interplanetary cows while simultaneouly treating us to her very own universe born of a superior imagination and richly developed characters whose fate ensnares us.Whether you're a Sci-Fi fan or not, I think you'll enjoy this novel simply because it quite well conceived and quite well written."
5,DO NOT SPEND $30 OR MORE ON THIS TITLE! AVAILABLE NEW FOR $20!,There are some unscrupulous sellers who are trying to get away with murder by selling this title here for $30-60!!! You can order this title brand new via Sandra Bernhard's own website (sandrabernhard dot com) for less than $20!!!! DONT BE RIPPED OFF!!!!!
4,Catchy Songs and Lots of Fun for Our Son!,"My husband brought this toy home for our five-month-old son, and he loves it! The only hard part is that the various continent names are hard to press ... but then again, our son is only five months old right now. Older children would be able to press the buttons easily, I'm sure. I often find him hugging the globe and rolling it around to hear the songs! I plan to buy this as a shower gift for a friend of mine. It's cute! :)"
5,"My twins like this ""ball"" for different reasons!",I got this as one of the boys' Christmas gifts. They're 16 months old. One loves rolling it around on the floor and laughs each time he does it.The other cried the 1st couple of times he held it and it started singing. Now he loves it. He carries this globe around with a big smile on his face.They haven't gotten to the point of pressing any of the different buttons for the continents just yet.The tune is catchy but can get a little annoying when you hear it for the 100th time in a day. At least I know it's getting used.
5,Only three songs,"There are only three songs on this EP. At first, I was slightly disappointed by that, because the price looked like it would be a full-length album. However, I love this little EP. If you love Stance Punks (as all right-thinking people do) then you will love this EP. Well worth it."
2,Never judge a book by its title!,"The book was alright, although lacking the excitement and in depth explanation of other kung fu books. The work did not contain any ""secrets"" of Shaolin Temple as the title implies, simply the basic facts and techniques that anyone with any knowledge of Chinese martial arts would know. Not necessarily the greatest book for your martial arts collection, but a semi-interesting read nontheless."
2,Not so good,"I bought this book thinking it will help me in my research on the myths of the Shaolin temple's involvement with MA. This is a edited version of a book that was published in China in c.a. 1918 and it is one of the sources of the myths about CMA. Smith's book has to little, to called it a ""definite"" guide is misleading."
3,A good basic guide to the Chinese form of self-defense.,"Even though I am a certified Tai Chi teacher, my personal expertise has been the Japanese martial arts. Nevertheless, this book by Robert W. Smith, is a good guide to the basic principles, theories and philosophy of the Chinese form of boxing,or kung fu as it is called most of the time today. There are no so called ""secrets"" revealed and this is not a text that one can easily learn from without the direct guidance of a teacher. However, the book is well written and provides a good introduction into some of the Chinese methods of boxing.Rating: 3 stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: A poetic tribute to warriors)."
2,Typical Robert Smith mush,"This book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today. The YI Jin Jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever. Neither is the Shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions. I don't care what the history of the manuscripts are, this book offers no definitive information. It is very vague and elementary, a lot like Smith's other books. The fighting methods shown are a poor representation of Shaolin skills. The true essence of Shaolin is beyond any manuscript, let alone a hoax manuscrpit from Taiwan, which is the inspiration for this book."
5,Very Comfortable Boxers,"I bought these because I absolutely hate boxers with the polyester or elastic linings at the waist because they're uncomfortable or itch all the time. These pair have a full cotton covered lining and are very lightweight, making them pretty comfortable to wear all day.If you find your self irritated by those boxers with elastic and other linings, try checking these out because I would consider them just about as comfortable as any expensive ""exclusive"" brand of boxer such as CK or Polo.I highly enjoy them and would order them again."
2,Mini 8's Have Mini Quality,"I made the assumption these would be of a higher quality than the lower cost units, wrong. They seem to work OK for a short while but start loosing their bulbs one at a time. Looking inside you will see a low cost product with a higher cost looking outside."
1,Lasts two days...,"I was using this as a demo for my elementary science students and it lasted maybe two days. The UFO ball is great, but very cheap and it sounds like others are experiencing the same problem. I contacted the company for a replacement and they offered a free pack of rubber bands instead...great customer service!"
3,Not bad,"This is a cool little item, but mine didn't work very well. And since I was using it as a demonstration to a class of 7th graders, it kind of wrecked what I was using it for. But for $5, I'm not going to complain much about that."
1,I THOUGHT I'D FOUND ANOTHER PIPPI BOOI,but this is just a short excerpt from the original pippi--which you can buy in its entirety for a dollar less!
3,nice!,I found these to be very comfortable. I don't remember if they needed breaking in but I don't think so. Also very cute on. Only problem was they fell apart after one season. So I ordered them again since they're pretty cheap anyway!
2,"Too much English, too few Italian dialogues","This tape does a good job in thoroughly explaining some of the basic grammatical rules about Italian nouns and adjectives (how the endings must conform and the rest of it). But almost 80% of the time you see and an English speaker explaining the rules in English. There are just two short dialogues between two native Italians in the tape with poor voice quality. Most of the example Italian sentences are read by English speakers, sometimes with noticeable American accent. In short I think you don't learn much by watching the entire tape, one can summerize the vocabulary and the grammatical rules explained in this tape in just 3 or 4 pages."
4,Feel great!,"These insoles work perfectly and help tremendously with my plantar faciitis. The only problem I have is that they still take up a lot of room in my shoes. I have had to resort to wearing shoes that lace up or were a little big to begin with. They are much better than the regular orthotic 3/4 insoles, however."
4,Thinsole orthotic,"I use these arch supports in all shoes and boots. They are compact and don't alter the fit of the shoe too much. If you have a narrow or low volume foot, they will improve the fit of the shoe. They are not rigid and I will sometimes glue a small block of felt under the arch to give it more lift, if needed. A cost effective alternative to expensive custom made orthotics."
5,Spenco orthotics saved my life,"I was suffering bad with heal spirs, having trouble standing up in the morning from the stabbing pains. Walking hurt a lot.A friend recommended these to me, and from the first day i had them in my shoes my feet felt better. I keep them in my shoes atall times."
5,"Well made, durable.","I started having heel pain (planar fasciitis) and bought 3 or 4 inserts to try. I like these. They're durable and I like the fabric/rubber sole molded into the plastic frame. I also like how they can be reshaped by heating in hot water and bending them. I haven't tried that, but that could be useful if it really works.For me, I like Dr. Scholl's PRO (pain relief orthotics for arch support). They're a little more comfortable. But, I think these Spencos would last longer. I think it might be beneficial to switch between them to get different support."
5,Ellen had a mass on her right hip bone.,"Ellen had a mass on her right hip bone. It was bone cancer. Her father David and sister Jana had come to confert her. She went to the hospital and got a new doctor, Dr. Alton. She wrote letters to friends and family there. Her sisters boyfriend, Dennis, had got a new store and Ellen went to visit it. She had lost her freedom of movement. She had to finish the school year in crutches. She had surgry done. It gave her no pain. She died on October, 1972."
5,Melissa's Finest Hour,"I really love this. Hey Ricky offers variety. Every track blows, especially the dance pop hit You Should Hear How She Talks About You which will get me struttin' round like a crazy person.Race To The End gets the perfect vocal treatment derived from Vangelis' electronic instrumental piece and Wish We Were Heroes is such a beautiful wistful country ballad.Elsewhere, Your Place Or Mine is deeply sensual. Come In From The Rain really highlights Manchester's vocal prowess.I'm glad Hey Ricky's being reissued but how is it that there are no bonus/extras?"
1,NOT waterproofed,We had gotten this for our daughter last year to Christmas. The watch didn't even last 3 month. She jumped in the pool and the watch was dead. Of course at this point no exchange or refund. We bought her a second Timex different color same thing. It clearly states they are water resistance up to 99 Feet my daughter never got close to that number. We are very disappointed in this Timex product.
3,Scratchy,"This is a nice watch- great idea for teaching time! My daughter LOVES the indiglo feature! The colors are pretty. BUT it is pretty itchy, even for a regular Jane- but my daughter is an unfortunate soul with super sensitive skin. She cannot wear it for any length of time. I tried wearing it one day, and agree, it's not comfortable. I wish the exact face, size and features were available with a regular leather strap. :-("
1,Doesn't work!!!,"This is an edited review. I had previously given the watch 5 stars. However, that was within a few days of getting the watch. Over the next week, the watch steadily lost time. So I took it and had the batteries changed. It worked fine for a day or two and then again, steadily started to lose time. I thought maybe my daughter was messing around with the setting button and had been pulling it out (which stops the watch until it's pushed back in). So I reset the watch and put it out of reach for a few days. When I checked back again, the watch had again lost time. I had bought the watch locally, and unfortunately, had thrown out all the packaging or else I'd be taking the watch back to the store."
3,Small face,"This watch is ok for the price and the little one that will wear it, but I for one think it is a little small faced for the arm of the child. It is good for a first watch and that is about all."
4,good service,"tracfone is a great company for anyone looking to get a contract free cellphone. because you can buy the minute cards anwhere this service is good even for kids. i would highly recommend their service to anyone especially if you have kids. with their new digital service you get free caller id an voicemail, which many of the other wireless service dont have. (...) I hope that you find this review helpful"
2,Phone Number Inactivated Without Notice,"I've used my TracFone for 3 years and never had any problems. I currently have over 722.5 minutes and a contract date which allows me to have the number until 10/28/09. I was so happy with my TracFone prepaid service and suddenly, my phone number was no longer in service. I had done nothing but buy over $135.00 worth airtime in May '07 and suddenly, my phone number was no longer active. After spending over 3 hours on the phone with TracFone, they claimed there was nothing they could do for me. I considered this a breach of contract and was out of cell phone service and money."
5,Get free 100 minutes!,"Tracfone has served me well. I have no problem talking in a basement. Always works anywhere I carry. If you are planning to purchase a Tracfone or already purchased it but did not activate yet, you are qualified for a free 100 minutes. Simply send me your email address so that I can refer you to Tracfone company. In less than a day or so, you will get an email from Tracfone saying I am referring you to the company. Then follow the steps suggested in that email and put my information you can find from that mail. In 1 - 2 days you will get a confirmation email regarding the availability of your free 100 minutes. Follow the steps in that email, then your phone will have extra 100 minutes!Email me at: yxc168 at yahoo dot com"
5,Cell phone,"I've had my Tracfone for about 3 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.comthank you."
3,TracFone Wireless,We travel appx. 200 miles every month or so and need the protection of a cell phone while on the road. My TracFone works well in all but a few undeveloped areas which are more than likely unavailabe for any cell phone because there are no towers to accommodate them. The rates are becoming more and more competative each month. We have had service with TracFone for two years now and for emergency usage or quick calls it works well and saves not having to pay a monthly service plan of other companies.
2,"TO, TO CONFUSING!!","Hate to be a wet blanket but this one is totally confusing to me. This is the 25th MaBain book I have read. I think I have given all of them a five star except two. This is about 24 hours in the life of the 87th Precinct. There are several cases and several policeman all involved at one time. You read about one case for a page or two, then another one for a page or two, until you go through all of them then you start over again. I like the detectives and I like the 87th Precinct, I did just not like this format. I guess my brain is not large enough to maintain it all and keep it straight. Will continue to read them as not likeing only two out of twenty five is pretty good."
2,poorly wrapped,The DVD got here and all I heard was a rattling inside the casing. The DVD was not properly attached to the case and got scratched from being in that state throughout being delivered (all of that while still being wrapped in the original plastic).Also the case does not close properly. I kept it anyway because the scratches are not severe enough to impact the stored data but expect more from amazon.com.
1,Not the soundtrack of the movie.,"I always thought that a soundtrack of a motion picture would include all the music played during that motion picture. Apparently this is not the case. I was really looking forward to hearing ""Carol of the Bells"", and ""White Christmas"" by the Drifters, but they are not on this CD, nor are any of the other songs. I guess the secret is to look for the words ""various artists"" to ensure getting the soundtrack. This CD contains only the music written especially for the movie. So you better watch out, you better not cry...."
4,Good album,"Due to limited supply, the sellers of this CD can ask for whatever they want in price. Best to buy this off season I found as the price dropped by $30-40 dollars. Pricey purchase, but we enjoy the album every year."
1,Not the original soundtrack,"This is NOT the original soundtrack. It seems to be an orchestral version of some kind. You will NOT find ""Oh Christmas Tree"" or ""Carol Of The Bells"" or ""White Christmas"" or ""Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town"" or ""Jingle Bell Ride"" or ""Gimme All Your Lovin"" by ZZ Top or ""Jingle Bells."" If you wanted any of those, they are not on this CD. If you enjoy elevator-type back-ground music however ..."
2,"Fast Shipping, Poor Quality","When I originally saw the ad for this guitar online the price was advertised as a reglular price of 129.00. (On sale for 40.00) After I recieved the guitar I was shocked at the cheap quality. Don't let the nice picture in the advertisement fool you. This thing can barely be tuned properly. I was very disapointed in the guitar itself but the customer service and the shipping was fast and great. I would buy from this seller again assuming a better product. However, I think the regular price should have been advertised as 40.00 and the sale price 5.00. Great customer service. Fast shipping. Poor quality merchandise."
3,Good starter guitar for the price,Not the highest quality but works well enough to get someone started before investing lots of money into a very expensive instrument.
1,Horrible,"My friends, DO NOT BUY PLEASE. From far away it looks really nice, but you look at it up close and it is just spray painted, the wood is super horrible quality. As soon as you place your hands it it, scratches will show and the guitar will get easily dented. You won't even be able to tune the guitar. Also, the bridge of the guitar is not even centered. Horrible!!! It is better to wait and spend money on a kit from Yamaha or Fender for double the money. Probably will turn out better that way. It is a toy guitar. You'll know what I mean if you decide to get it. Wood with stickers is all this is. Sad but true."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.,"I bought this product because it was exceptionally cheap.However, I realized why it was so cheap when I opened the package.I bought this guitar as ""NEW"".However, the guitar had many visible scratches and dents.There were even marks of super glue between the neck and the body of this guitar (apparently not something that was there when it was made in the factory).There was a huge scratch (about 1.5 inch) on the head of the guitar and the seller colored it with a red pen, hoping that it would not show.This was the single worst product I have ever gotten from an Amazon seller.It is very possible that other product of this seller (if there is any) are ridiculously low quality as this guitar was.Please, do not buy from this seller."
2,Didn't get cover art on my Kindle,"I enjoyed reading the book, but I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the cover art when I purchased this book for my Kindle. It was light buying the new book at a book store, but before the cashier gave me my book had ripped off the cover, yet charged me full price for the damaged book. It's like the publisher didn't bother to include the cover image and didn't care whether readers wanted the cover image or not, since it's a digitatl copy of the book. Not having the cover reduced my enjoyment of the book."
2,Uh....I am not sure what happened.,"I don't mind the fact that Terry chose to give us another perspective and a break from Richard and Kahlan. What I abhor are nonsensical conclusions. This book had potential to be great and fell flat on its face as the coincidences and repetitive descriptors (seriously, if I ever read the words ""raptor gaze"" when describing Richard's eyes again it will be too soon) that make me wonder about Terry's ability to mature as he builds experience. At the end of the final conflict, I just felt...cheated."
2,some things i thought about pillars of creation,"The book itself wasn't that badly written. I feel, however, that it was to far from the story of Kahlan and Richard. The story line itself was choppy; I thought it rushed ahead and then slowed down when it didn't need to. These are just things that i thought when i read the book. What disappointed me the most was that the other books were so good and offerred interesting parallels... this one didn't.The two characters were very good. but that doesn't matter because they had little relation to the other stories. The most intersting of characters aren't even in the story; they just come in at the end to save the day. Oh well; i will still pay my [money] on the next book which comes out. as will everyone else who loved the first books in the series."
2,Like X-files without Sculley or Mulder,"I listened to the audio tape and found myself wishing that the book would end. I did not find Jennsen Rahl particularly interesting and kept hoping that the main characters-Richard and Kahlan would put in an appearance. Needless to say, they did not appear until the book had just about concluded.It would have been more interesting if this book took up where the last one ended (I remember there being some question about Kahlan possibly giving birth to a son who would have a major impact on D'Hara). Oh well,I felt compelled to listen to the entire book because I have read all the others."
2,Um....what happened to the story?,"This is one of my favorite fantasy series but I found this book and the last one to be dissapointing. The last one ""Faith of the Fallen"" seemed to be only half a story and left a lot unfinished. I was hoping that this one would at least complete all the loose ends from the last book but it did not. It almost seemed like a veerrryyyy long short story. Richard and Kahlan did not come in until the very end and while the storyline with Jennsen and her different view of Richard and the order was somewhat interesting, it seems to me like it could have been condensed so that we could get back to the main story and tie up some of the loose ends from the last book. Personally, I am ready for a conclusion and happy ending in the next book."
2,Where are the main characters ?,"Goodkind is a good writer, but this series has been based on the main characters that have been developed in the first 6 books. Those main characters are absent in this book !Richard and Kahlan were hardly in the book at all. None of the themes from the other books were carried over. In fact, there seems to be no continuity. This book is not really part of the series, it should be a standalone book that takes place in another universe."
4,It Came Up Short,"As a reader I came to this series late. I discovered it in January of this year and read all the books by May. I was eargerly awaiting this latest volume since that time. Although it is a good book, I believe that people like me who have read all the previous volumes will be disappointed in this one. The bottom line is that there is simply not enough of the charecters that we have become so involved with. Richard abd Kahlan do not appear for more than 4/5ths of the book. you just can't have enough of them. Barely any of Zedd and Cara. None of Verna and Ann. While I will be egerly awaiting his next book and will purchase immediatly upon publication, I hope to see more of my old friends at that time."
4,Good book gets bad review,"Despite all the bad reviews from other readers, I tried this book and really enjoyed it. It had all the action, suspense and page turning thrills as all the others in this series. Goodkind is an excellent writer and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the previous books."
2,This Was HORRIBLE!,"This book really disapointed me. While the book does give the reader a different perspective, the whole time I was waiting for Richard and Kahlan to come and be the focus. Besides the fact that Goodkind forgot about all the important charachters, nothing in the series plot really changes. Emperor is still trying to takeover the midlands, nothing chamges with Richard, no new developments are made. I hope that the next book returns to the original format, or many of his fans will be extremely disappointed."
4,An Interesting Book,"Something that would have helped me to know I give to you. Richard Rahl will not appear in this book till the last couple of chapters. I kept waiting for the main characters to take over but they never did. Half way through the book when I finally realized Richard wasn't coming things went better.This book doesn't really advance the main storyline at all. It revolves around Richard's evil half brother and sweet and innocent half sister. I personally enjoyed the departure from the main storyline, but I can see how many people would be annoyed by this. The story was interesting enough though that I enjoyed it."
3,Pillars of Creation,"good read, refreshing perspective--although by the end you are just dying to hear *something* about good old Richard and co."
3,please change,I really enjoyed this book but it seemed to get to far from the previos story lines. I wanted to read a book about the sword of truth but got a long story about a distant relative of Richards.
1,Disappointing....,"Disappointing to say the least. I read Faith of The Fallen and was extemely impressed. This is the first book I read in the Sword of Truth series. I was so pleased, I read it 3-4 times. It was that good. I didn't even give a second thought of buying Pillar of Creations, I wish I did. The first few chapters, I thought i was readin another book. The story had a bland taste to it since it focused more on dragging out details to the extent of boredom. I mean, I skipped about 10 pages in the swamp chapter(Althea). It usually takes me about 4-5hours to finish a book this size. The whole storyline of love was also empty and non realistic. it can't even be called a cliche since it was so poorly done. i hope Goodkind can refocus his efforts on dealin out some better literature. i kno i'm being a bit cruel but payin for somethin so boring is aggravating."
4,I wonder..........,"As for this book, I felt the best analogy to describe it is a foundation. If the next book(s) are really good, then they will have been built upon this foundation, but if they aren't, then all we have is a lot of rubble. I have faith in Terry to build upon this foundation into a mansion.Also there are many characters I have been wondering what has happened to-Chase (What is the most dangerous ungifted man in the New World doing now that the boundary has fallen?)-Shota (Shota is always up to something, always)-Prelate Annalina - (what exactly was her encounter with the Healers of Redcliffe?)-Nathan (What is he up to at the People's Palace, and what did he do before he went there?)-Sister Ulicia (Disappeared after swearing loyalty to Richard. I doubt the leader of the Sisters of the Dark has been sitting on her hands all this time)-Nicci (would like to see what she's been up to since her ""conversion"")-Gratch (what is that gar up to?)"
1,This entire book is filler.,"The first thing I have to say is that I'm not the biggest sword of truth fan.. I like wheel of time a lot better. But, after the sixth sword of truth book, I had almost switched--the sixth book was amazing. However, Pillars of Creation is terrible. It completlely excludes the all of the main characters and the characters were what made the series. I wouldn't recommend this book unless your really a diehard fan."
1,We can't believe that they went ahead and published it.,"WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:If you're a Goodkind fan-boy, then don't let us distract you. Go out and spend your $10-$20 on this book. If you're empty-headed enough to like it, why, go ahead and buy the eighth book as well. You certainly don't need our permission. But we warn you: this book is badly written, badly edited, and feebly concludes. Even for fans, it's a crushing departure from the--I guess we have to call it this--story arc of previous books and it couldn't possibly stand on its own as a worthwhile novel absent those predecessors that it chooses to ignore.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:We gave it a 1. It's our worst rating. We reserve 1's for books that make us temporarily regret ever learning to read. If the reader would rather avoid such painful regrets, then trust our review and avoid this book at all costs.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"
1,Awful,"Goodkind has let us down in this last book. There is little or no plot -- certainly no plot developements with regard to Richard, Kahlan or the Order.As you read the book you'll find yourself encountering the same sentences over and over (sometimes just a few pages back). The metaphors are always the same ('He was invicible.' 'She was invicible.' 'I am tired of running.' 'It felt like lightning.'). The characters are very, very naive and one-dimensional. His two new characters, Jensen and Oba contradict themselves constantly thru their actions. It is not a refreshing, entertaining or enjoyable read.Owning this book feels like a ripoff -- first time Ive had this feeling and I've ready many many books. If you must read it, get it at the library."
2,worst Goodkind book,This is the only book in the series I read for a long time. It was so boring I couldn't read it more than 10 minutes! And once I read it for the time 8s book arrived I couldn't remember the story of Pillars of Creation. So I had to read it once more. This is my unfavourite book in Goodkind's series!
2,What have you done TERRY,"Terry, you destroyed my waiting of a year for THIS. This is the worst book yet. It totally squashes all the giddy feelin I had when I got it and started reading like a starving man. I loved Terry's work in SOT series and I think that this series is one of the best I have read in my life...BUT please Terry, don't kill it with books like this las t one.......don't start out like Robert Jordan."
1,This book is a hole in the series,"Do not buy this book in hardback!!!!I have read everything he has written and have enjoyed every word and have waited year after year for each edition, and when I read this book it was nothing more than a let down. The characters are not likable or intersting, the plot is weak, and it was only my respect for his past writings that I kept on turning the page. Our beloved characters and reoccuring themes (Wizard Rule #7) are written in a flat and baffoonish manner, they are a punchline, making this book a 500+ page joke. The ending was similar to an ending out of Threes Company or some other cheap comedy in which a lame joke is told, the cheap music starts, and the credits roll."
1,For sale.....,an almost new Pillars of Creation book. Just skimmed once. Have to sell it because of the extreme boredom it radiates. Contact me if you're interested.
4,Good book if you give it a chance,"I was under the impression that this book wasn't good because of all the reviews here. I'm glad I went ahead and read it anyway, because the story is significantly advanced in Pillars of Creation, even though Richard is absent. If there are problems with the story, then I just overlook them. Why am I reading fantasy to begin with? Not to analyze it, but to enjoy it. I suspend my disbelief, but at the same time want events to be plausible. In PoC everything is plausible, so why would I object?"
2,Oh where has my Richard gone?,"I don't like Jennsen. Richard doesn't even show up in the book as a character until page 500. This book is basically Wizards First Rule rewritten with Richard being Jennsen. It's a good book, just redundant. I think this book was just written as a preview of what the next one will be like. I was disappointed in it. I hope R & K are in the next book. It's more interesting with them."
3,It is not what I have come to expect but I liked it.,I thought this book was great. It was so different. At times I felt like I was reading the first book again; here was a new character discovering this wonderful world from a new perspective. Well done Mr. Goodkind. I look forward to the next book.
4,Different but Good,"This book got away from the main characters, which I thought was a great change of pace. I recommend that you read all the comments posted before you start this book so you understand completely what you should expect. This book has very little to do with the main characters, but because I knew that going in, I read it with a different expectation and really enjoyed it."
1,Will this series ever end.....,"If you're buying this book cuz you love richard, kahlan, zorander, adie, nathan, and cara, save your money until the next one. They're barely in it, I could count, but my guess is they appear on maybe 10 pages.If you want to1)see a young innocent girl deceived by the bad guys in boring detail for 557 pages, 2). be preached at with the same (not new, the same) tiresome dialogue that's begun to drag down the other books, and 3). see Mr. Goodkind explore the torture and maiming of innocents in a manner that would make a method actor proud, then this is your book.It would also be nice if Mr. Goodkind would stop reading Robert Jordan....of course both refuse to end the story cuz they are making too much money. Shame on them!"
1,Big Mistake,"First, I believe the book could have been written in under 200 pages. That being said, I found the book to be repititious and very uninteresting. I believe that the Sword of Truth series is losing its momentum like many series do. I also failed to see much continuity between this book and the last. If you must read it, get it at the library. Even better, read George R. R. Martin's Song of Fire and Ice series.P.S. I at times thought that a child wrote this book. I know Mr. Goodkind can do better."
3,Predictable!!!,"I anxiously awaited this addition to the Sword of Truth series which I think is definitely one of the best out there. Unfortunately I found this story to be VERY predictable. I was disappointed that Richard, Khalan, Zed, the Mord-Sith barely appeared in this plot. Emperor Jagang hardly even comes across as the evil that he is. After all that wait we're presented with a book that doesn't move the main storyline along one bit. So we have to wait once again. Dear Mr. Goodkind, it's o.k. to draw a series to conclusion, to wrap up a story and move on; you don't have to leave us hanging with each installment, we'll continue to buy your books. The book was worth the read and hard to put down, just not quite up to par for the series. I really wanted to give it four stars because I love the previous books, but I have to be honest and give it a solid three."
4,Just as I suspected...,"Once again logic succeeds in predicting human behavior as foolish people get angry because something isn't exactly what they thought it would be. Terry Goodkind has been brave enough to give us a truly remarkable book with a story line that (despite other reviewers opinions) ties in well with the rest of the series. Although I was dissapointed that some of the major players in the previous books played lesser roles in this one, that shouldn't be allowed to ruin your reading experience. Instead, you should focus on the fact that you have in your hands a very well thought out, entertaining book.The one thing that I truly hope is that the unwarranted negative reaction to this book won't cut short this wonderful journey which I have enjoyed since the moment I took my first steps. Please don't pay any attention to the words of the bitterly dissapointed children who didn't get exactly what they wanted from the book, and decide for yourself with an open mind"
1,Piss poor writing....!,"I started reading this book whit great joy, and expected this book to give me the conclusion from Faith of the fallen.But Mr Goodkind should be ashamed of himself. This is not up to his standard, considering the other 6 Sword of the truth series.I was extremely disappointed with this book. A disapointed formely fan................................."
1,Where's Ulic and Egan?,"That's what I want to know. Those guys are so awesome, I have no idea why Mr. Goodkind would purposely want to leave them out of the book. Jennesen is soooo pyscho, she doesn't even understand what is happening around her. She is so brainwashed it makes me sick to read. Oba is a sadistic little welp that should get a soldiers' pike upside the head, that'll open his eyes to what he really is. This book is missing key ingredients: ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS FROM THE PREVIOUS SERIES. Mr. Goodkind, give the people what they want. Not some thought up on a whim stupidity that you've written."
2,Filler,"Although not a bad book, it didn't really have a whole lot to do with the main story line in the series. After about 100 pages, I found myself flipping forward to try and see when Goodkind would get on with it. Unfortunately, he didn't until the last couple of chapters, and then it was a bit of a forced tie-in.This is more of a side story instead of a continuation of a series, which is disappointing as the description of it makes it sound like the main story line will be continued in this one. If he's going to write a side story, he should at least be honest about it.After the last book, Faith of the Fallen, which I felt was an incredible book, this was a real let down. There were a lot of threads left open at the end of that one which were just ignored and now we have to wait another year to find out what happens."
2,Not so good....,Just try to pretend the series ended with book six. You're really not missing anything.
2,Not relavent to the plot line,This goes on some big sidetangent not related to the story. Really not that worthwhile to read.
1,If you have to...,"Now now now...Despite what MANY other people have said, I've enjoyed this series. Well, except for this book. The characters are predictible, annoying, and naive. The characters displayed in this book should be of the age of 13 instead of being in their 20s. Some of it was alright, however. I guess I give it a 1 and a half. However, like Jordan, Terry seems to be making books now as filler between important events. Oh, well. He should just finish it, sheesh."
2,read the older books for satisfaction,"If you're like me and have read all books in the series up till now, I would recommend re-reading Wizards First Rule, and Stone of Tears. No possible way can you read in order WFR, SoT, and then Pillars of Creation. Comparing the best to the worst. But over the last few books the quality has seeped out, almost to where the Pillars of Creation is acceptable. Almost.For all of you(300) that say to us(300,000) ""get over it, he's introducing new elements. This series used to be beyond greatness. It had wonderfull characters impossible to forget. Chase. Chandalen. Denna. Now Richard, Kahlan, and we the readers need to dust ourselves off from the past few books and remember what it once was. I've never been able to commit myself to a series of books before this. Don't let it wind down like this Terry."
2,Where did everyone go?,"The book it's self was decent enough. As a part of the series it was not only disappointing, it was treason to the original storyline. There were more than enough problems in the world that needed answers but instead he completely drops all the main characters for a new set and only at the VERY end do you get to see the original cast, and only briefly. SO, if you have not read the other books in the series, this is a good book, full of adventure. If you are a fan of the series, you may as well pour salt in your eyes instead of wasting the time to read this. This is a sad day, the seeker is dead!"
2,Total sidestep,"I have read the whole series og Goodkind, and loving it. But in the last book, Pillars of creation, we read almost nothing about the characters we have gotten to know and love. 90% of the book is about two characters who are ultra-stereotypes of good and evil, and the last 100 pages or so is like we have learned to love Goodkind. Sure, the plot crawls forward, but in my view, the characters he has made are so important in this epic saga that one cannot leave them out and still satisfy devoted readers. And the plot itself moves so little that you van actually skip this book and miss little."
3,"Not great, but not too bad also","This book is not about Richard or Kahlan. It took me a while to digest that, and I'm sure several fans can't deal with it at all.After I got over it, though, I found that the book indeed is very enjoyable. In my opinion the only major flaw of the book is a character named Oba - he's really not too interesting a character. At times I felt tempted to skip all parts that dealt with him.My guess is that Terry Goodkind knows what he is doing when he dedicates an entire book to a new character in the series. This book may be an important stepping stone for following works, sort of like ""Blood of the Fold"" was for ""Temple of the Winds"" and ""Soul of the Fire"" was for ""Faith of the Fallen"". I can very well imagine that the eigth book will be a real doozy again."
1,I couldn't even finish it,"It took me months of reading bits of it, until I gave up in defeat of ever finish reading this book. It is truly bad. Only one book that I have read is worse than this out of thousands of books. I would rate all of his previous books either a 4 or 5. And it has nothing to do with having Richard there or not. It was simply boring with characters I couldn't give rat's ... for.His next book will be out in a few months, and instead of pre-ordering his hardback books like I have before. I will wait until it is released, so I can read a few pages first. I have simply lost my faith that what he writes will be any good."
1,the worst book i have ever tried to read.,i love the sword of truth series but this book was awfull i couldn't even finish it. i have owned this book for 2 years and i can't get even half way through it. it is boring and i cannot believe Terry Goodkind even wrote it. i suggest that you should buy some other book and not waste your money on this one.
2,"Started off okay, but.........","Very predictable stuff, here. Yawn.... Very contrived betrayals and the way all the separate characters finally come together in the end is too coincidental.I don't even want to get in to the disappoint of the ending, it's just too sad.I didn't give it one star because I have read books worse than this."
3,not as good as some of his other works,"he contunes to write wonderfully but he brings u through the whole book with out you know whats the point of it other then to see oba walk through and kill, mangle and distroy every thing jenn comes in contact with then hits you with the ""o by the way its a good thing richard did this this and this other wise the world would have ended "" some thing that would have been better off if explained 1/2 way though the book"
1,This is just ridiculous.,"Woa... Let me say that I liked the first 4 books of this series, but now Goodkind turned into total [...].This book is the absolute worst book I've seen him write. Unfortuantely, it seems he is just trying to get our money now... This piece of work is turning the entire series into a [...] fight between Communists (Jagang the Just) and Democrats (Richard Rahl). Not only the writer made it look like that, for some unknown reasons he also made Commies much more stupid than D'Harans... [...]? I didnt buy this book to read about political situation 50 years ago... Totally worthless, honestly, look somehwere else."
2,First reviewer,This book is very good if you enjoy childish fantasy novels that lack character depth. The plot is amusingly simple. I think its time for Goodkind to give his novels a rest. I for one am tired of the good samaritan-like characters.
1,End this series - please,"The series was extremely strong at the beginning, but has grown weaker with less and less happening of interest as the series continued. Save your money and request Terry Goodkind start another series, even if set in the same world, but totally unrelated to the Rahl's, etc."
4,This is one of the few times that I've taken on science fiction.,"The way that the Goodkind tells a story is absolutely amazing. I have read very few if any science fiction books but if they all are as engrossing as this book was I might soon find myself hooked. It would have got 5 stars but do to my lack of experience with the genre I only felt comfortable giving out 4 stars. Do not hesitate to read if you have the time, its well worth it."
2,Looked for more,"This is the only fantasy book I own in which the story does not follow the main characters. As I was reading it, I kept on thinking ""ok, next chapter they'll get to Richard and Kahlan."" They don't until almost the very end of the book. This is Goodkind's worst book of the series, in my opinion."
3,Enjoyable but not satisfying.,"Pillars of Creation is an okay book. It really is. There is nothing terribly bad about it. But, it is not terribly good either. It is not a tough read, but for me it dragged because I am heavily emotionally invested in the other characters who do not show up very much in this book. Approach it with caution and resignation. If you love Richard, Kahlan, Cara, Zedd, etc. ...realize that this book really has barely anything to do with them. I think if I had known how little it would be about them before reading the book it would have been easier for me to get through. So, if you are reading these books and got through Soul of Fire... just get through this one and go on to Naked Empire which gets really amazing. And it's not entirely without merit... just Pillars of Creation was not the most enjoyable read in my opinion."
3,Strange thing,"I noticed watching an old Friday the 13th movie that there is an obscure actress named Jensen Daggett. That's such an odd name in general that I have to wonder if Terry Goodkind ripped it off from her for the character. The question is: why would anyone do that?As to the book, it was fine."
2,Not his best work,I am a big fan of the Sword of Truth series. This book however was not one of my favorites. Instead of following the old characters you have grown to love he creates totally new ones. Don't get me wrong I like new characters but you can't spend a whole book following them. I bought this book with the hope of reading more about the Sword of Truth and Richards exploits. I was very disapointed to find that this book doesn't follow Richard at all. If I was not loyal to Goodkinds books I would not have even bothered to read the whole book. Yes I thought it was that boring.
4,where's Richard?,"Great book, but it seems a little late in the series to indroduce a new major character. I kept waiting for Richard to show up. This book just made me crave the next book in the series even more."
1,What a Disappointment!,"Until now, Terry Goodkind could be counted on to create an interesting story. This latest addition, however, is frankly unreadable. The plot is plodding and the characters of no interest. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to complete this book. I can't recall the last time I failed to read a book cover to cover (OK I can...Moby Dick when in high school!). This effort is totally wasted and I hope the author regains his previously demonstrated ability to create. Two thumbs way down."
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"This book just drags on and on, repeating the same stuff over and over again throughout the entire book. It seemed as though he was trying to turn two or three ideas into an entire book. It became an effort to keep from just putting it down."
1,What Happened?,"I looked forward to each installment of this series with great anticipation and was never disappointed. After finishing this book, I am worried that the well has run dry. It is very disturbing when the main characters from the earlier books, COLLECTIVELY, appear in less than 10 percent of the book. Yikes!I am hoping that this book was a necessary interlude to set up the future of the series. If not, it will be the disappointing end of what has been a very good fantasy saga."
1,Too Little Richard and Kahlin,"This Book was very disappointing almost from the start. I was wanting the continuation of the last 6 books (which were fabulous). Instead I was forced to endure all about two someone's new, whom I could care less about and never did grow to like. It was the next to the last tape before out hero or his wife show up. All in all, just a big let down."
1,ACK!!!! The last 30 pages were good atleast.....,"Well if you wanna book about the main characters in the ""Sword of truth series"" you can just skip this one. I don't think you'd miss much if you just went to the next book, when it comes out. I found myself skipping entire pages becase I already knew what was happening, Goodkind was just stretching it out. (Really, really streching it out.) Not to knock Goodkind, i love the rest of his books but this one is my least favorite, I'll even go on to say that it was a bad book. Just my opinion...."
2,The Pillars of Creation,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Definitely not up to Goodkind's normal standard. A whole book devoted to developing 2 new characters, but left you wondering when the last book was going to be picked up and when the main characters were going to enter the picture."
1,Is he short on cash???,"This has got to be the worst one of the series. All of them up to this one have been very good. He spends almost 400 pages on what amounts to nothing and then the last 150 on characters that the fans care about. Just jump to page 404, chapter 44 and you can get what you want out of the book. You can skip the life histories of Jennsen and Oba which take up the majority of this mind numbing waste of trees."
1,A disappointing continuation of an excellent series,"I started out reading The Pillars of Creation with high expectations, but after the first five chapters, I was deeply troubled by what was occuring. Not only was there little of any literary value in this book, I found it boring, long winded and generally poorly incorporated. A similar task was undertaken in the fifth book (Soul of the Fire) but it was done much better than this one. I must say that I hope Mr. Goodkind returns swiftly to the handful of characters anybody will ever care about in this series and leave extra garbage like this on editing room floor. I sorely wish I could rate this book better based on it's predecessors, but sadly I cannot. It is a sad day indeed......."
3,stunted ending,"The majority of the story was decent and worth the read, although it doesn't compare to the rest of the series. Toward the end, it almost seems that Goodkind realized he had written enough and decided to throw on an ending. While there was great potential for a climax and an ending, that potential seemed to be abandoned for a quick finish to the novel."
1,Very disappointed,"This is a book that should have been condensed to a few chapters and included in another book, or better yet, left out of the series entirely. It adds no value whatsoever to the series. All I've gotten from this book is a headache from being relentlessly hammered with Goodkind's philosophy. The characters you fell in love with, well they are gone. They are replaced with emotionless shells that parrot the same objectivist line over and over and over again. A simple conversation turns into a sermon. Reading this series leaves me feeling like a revolutionary sent to a political re-education camp. Goodkind has completely defaced a story and characters I had come to love. My disappointment in Goodkind is beyond words."
1,Worst one in the series (so far),"Nothing happens in this book! I plodded through the first 3/4 of it hoping it was all going to come together at the end like it does in Soul of the Fire... and then it ends in about 2 pages that make no sense at all. This one actually made me long for the sanctimonious political stuff from faith of the fallen, because at least that was somewhat thought-provoking."
1,Skip this one,"Agreed. SOT is a great series, but save yourself time and grief and just read the summary on wikipedia and move on with the rest of the books. You won't miss out on anything and still enjoy the series, I promise. It's not even good in and of itself, and it certainly doesn't add to the series."
1,Awful book to be included in the otherwise great series,"This it not Terry Goodkind's best work, to put it kindly. I know there is a reason for him setting up the background on the characters, but it could have been done in a chapter. It's awful. For those that thought Soul of the Fire was awful, it was about 10 steps above this one."
2,Not my favorite book,A little background:I have become totally engrossed in this series since watching the first episode on tv last year. So far each book has been exciting and so much more in depth and interesting than the tv program and I couldn't wait to turn the page. Except for Pillars of Creation.I tried so hard to like this book but there were times that I would literally scan the pages for anything that may be important to the story later on because it was so uninteresting to me. I just couldn't relate to the characters and I'm not really sure why. The end was a let down and I sure hope that this book will somehow be referenced later in the book series to justify the time I spent reading it.
2,Book 7 Disapointment,"I admit this is unfair since I am only half way through. But I may not make it through! I had the same reaction to book seven of the ""Wheel of Time"" series. I gave up on the series after book seven.Anyway, I find the story line silly and the characters uninteresting. But since it is a cold and rainy day in South Florida I guess I have nothing better to do but to continue reading, even if it is a stuggle."
3,A nice change,"Enjoyed that this chapter in the ongoing saga was not focused totally on Richard and Kahlan. In fact, they were not present until very late in the book. This is one of the more interesting and bizarre books and not for the faint of heart. Recommend this one."
3,Richard & Kaylan are not in this story very much but the story still holds,New characters introduced and not as riviting as earlier books. Still good read.Has a few 'holes' in the story line.
1,Aweful,"I have faithfully read all the Sword of Truth novels and eagerly anticipated new novels by Terry Goodkind. Overall, I enjoy the series even thought it falters at times. However, this book was aweful and painfully predictable. There were no interesting twists, it was completely flat and poorly developed. Although the entire series relies heavily on violence and gore, this one took it to boring extremes. The book could have been interesting but it fails totally."
1,It sucketh,"Goodkind once said in an interview that he kept the story in his head for the Sword of Truth series, not needing an outline to keep track of it. He really ought to rethink that strategy.This book has nothing whatsoever to do with the story started a few years back in Wizard's First Rule. It is a thin, bpring side tale of yet another ... brother of Richard's, who acts just like Drefan did. Gee, I guess Richard was the only child that turned out ok. Duh.What a colossal waste of trees. Save your money so that's not another colossal waste. I will NEVER waste my time on another Terry Goodkind book. The rest of you, who are so disappointed and keep hoping the next one is better--GET HELP!"
2,"No longer so good, and maybe not kind","I was disappointed in this new book by Terry Goodkind. I missed the old characters, the humor, the caring between different characters, the magic, and the nobility, or search therefore, in characters. But most of all, I found the sadistic Oba ruined the book for me. I read to be entertained, not to be sickened over and over again by a character who must kill and maim. Yes, there has to be an evil element for good to fight against, but this went beyond what was necessary. And although I kept reading to find out why he had to be that way to help the story, I never found the reason. Next time, I won't instantly buy a new Goodkind book, I will wait and read some reviews. If this is the direction he is taking, I will go another."
4,Pillars of Creation,"Knowing that this book was a side story, and had little of Richard and Kahlan, enabled me to enjoy it fully!"
1,worthless dribble.,"After having read over 1/2 of this book, I have decided I will no longer read books in the SOT series. Nothing in this book moves the story plot along. With entirely new and seemingly unimportant characters being the focus of an entire book it begs the question, ""Is he just out for money? Because clearly this book has nothing to do with the story."" You could summarize the first 1/2 of the book into 4 chapters and move on to the real part of the story.I would recomment skipping it entirely read a summary on wikipedia and move on to the next book that actually has to do with the story and plot.I will now be looking for someone else to read as clearly Goodkind does not cut the butter any longer.on a side note. Can I give this book 0 stars?"
1,Do not buy this book in hardcover!,"It had to happen sooner or later. Goodkind finally followed Rober Jordan's example and started writing books that serve only to lengthen his series. Faith of the Fallen was immensely entertaining, but didn't accomplish much in the way of plot development. This book is absolutely stagnant. The series' two main characters only appear in the last seventy pages. In a 500+ page book, only one chapter met the standard for action and entertainment Goodind's previous works have set. Next time, I'll save my (money) and wait for the paperback. Maybe if all of his fans do the same, Goodkind's friends at Tor will make him trim the pointless filler."
1,Boo! Hiss!,"What IS this? IF Goodkind is going to abandon the story he was telling and throw a couple of chapters of Richard and Kahlan in to officially make it a SOT book, how can anyone think this is a continuing series? What a ripoff!These books have really been losing steam since STONE OF TEARS which was the apex of the series at book 2. THe worst was probably Soul of the Fire, until now. The last one, FAITH OF THE FALLEN, had some signs of redemption, though it was a lot of political ranting and raving based on Ayn Rand. I can't believe I preordered this book, and I will never do it again."
1,I can not believe how bad this book is!,"I am so utterly depressed about this book. After waiting so long to find out about Richard and Khalan, and how they will deal with the impending war, the out come of the rebellion, and the rest of the lose threads....we get this! This is a lame book about a lame character. I have been a devout reader of this series, but this has got to be the worst disappointment I have had since I have started reading. Richard and Khalan are only after thoughts in this book and only come into play the last few chapters. This has to be joke, this can't be the real book right? I can't say enough about how badly this book s!@#s, so I have to stop before I get really upset!"
2,Seriously Disappointing,"First of all, I'd like to say that I really enjoy The Sword of Truth Series. It gives me everything in a fantasy novel that I could ask for. At times, Goodkind makes me drop Jordan to number 2 on my fav list.This book, however, puts Jordan back to number 1. The only reason I got any joy out of it was when I made the ultimate reader crime and started skipping ahead. I'd read a page here, a page there, and then, suddenly - thankfully! - I reached the story where Richard and Kahlan come into play. After that I read it straight through and really enjoyed it. That's the only reason.It seems to me that Goodkind is stretching his story out a little too thin. He needs to focus on the parts of the story that made it so successful in the past - Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd. When he does that, I might be able to keep him from falling further on the list. As it is, he's already crawling behind Jordan, George R.R. Martin, and Tad Williams."
3,dissappointment,"a fan of terry goodkind, i was dissappointed at this book's change of perspective to highlight the minor character's adventures instead of focusing on the main character Richard.I have been reading the whole book, hoping that the next chapter would be about Richard, Kathlan or at least any of the usual characters within the circle like Zedd. Much to my dismay, i read from cover to cover with so much as reading their names only a few times.it may be a fresh breath of air for some, but for me, it was a total dissappointment."
1,The best review I can give for this book...,"... and the whole trainwreck of a series:The popularity of these awfully written books can only be taken as the best proof that Goodkind's First Rule is painfully true - ""People are stupid"". Goodkind clearly writes with this in mind, and is therefore enjoying massive commercial success. He must be laughing all the way to the bank, especially when he considers that he even had the temerity to TELL his readers they're stupid and they still gobble up all the offal he sends their way like filet mignon.I suppose the author can at least be praised for so thoroughly and amusingly verifying his own unflattering view of humanity's average intelligence."
2,Major disappointment,"After getting totally hooked on the main characters and the usual fast pace of Book 6 and most of the previous books, this book was extremely slow going and down right boring. I hated Oba from the beginning and thought his presence was a total waste of time. I did like the new character Jennsen but really wished it would have stayed with Richard and Kahlan and introduced her in some other less time consuming manner. Waiting until the last 50 pages for your favorite characters is a real drag. I should have waited for the paperback."
2,Oh what might've been...,"Yep, I'd have to agree with most of the other reviews on here.. I didn't truly care about this character and I was constantly waiting for Richard to appear in at least some form, but, nope.. He's in about 1/20 of the book and even then he doesn't have much to say/do..The ending seems to come out of nowhere, the whole first half of the book is a small journey across D'Hara with few interesting developments and yet the journey to the Old World which should be 5-10 times as far is not even given one page to describe..The ending also had a bunch of holes and didn't really flow with past descriptions of events.. But obviously jennsen was introduced to be a part of the series from now on.. However, she could've been introduced and fully flessed out in less than 500 PAGES!...I read sword of truth to hear about richard and the sword of truth, this book contained very little plot moving events other than jennsen appearing..It's too bad.."
2,"An ok read, But Richard and kahlan fans beware!","In Terry Goodkind's latest novel we follow the new character of Jensen on her journey of self discovery. Jensen is Richard's half sister and she believes Richard is out to kill her like their murderous father attempted to. Terry Goodkind is an incredible author and while I applaude him for using fantasy as a genre to present his political philosophies at times he climbs a little to high on his soap box. Another major drawback to this book is that Richard and Kahlan, the series main characters occupy less than twenty pages. For true Terry fans the novel can be enjoyable if you are forewarned of the lack of main characters. I still can only give this book two stars because I was not warned of the lack of the original characters and therefore looked forward for over a year to reading about them only to be disappointed."
3,Disappointed,"Like Craig I loved the first 6 books in the SOT series. I have anxiously awaited Pillars of Creation. I went straight to the bookstore, grabbed it off the shelf, and was reading it as I walked out the door of the bookstore. Five chapters later there was still nothing on Kahlan, Richard, Cara, and Zedd. So I furiously scanned the book for their names and was disappointed to find them darn near the end of the book. I love the guys work, I just wish he could have woven what they were up to throughout the story of the offspring he was weaving. He had done that well in the past."
1,Blech!,"I've read a lot of fantasy/sci-fi, and I know that it's asking a lot to expect everyone to be an Asimov or Le Guin or Gaiman; but this was a waste of time and money. Goodkind's droning prose takes what could have been an interesting and even exiting plot in a 350-400 page book and turns it into a 700+ page ordeal. I frequently skipped 4-5 pages at a time and NEVER MISSED A BEAT IN THE PLOT. Disregarding the fact that, without having read any of the previous books, I immediately figured out that Sebastian was a villian; the characters constantly re-hash the same saccharin moral dilemnas page after page after page after.... you get the point. If you really want to read this book, get it from the library: you don't need to own it.And don't even start me on the goat. Geez!"
2,Ok as fantasy books go but not spectacular,"I have read all books previous to this one and I was put off by the change in characters. I can understand the reasoning to do so, to give the reader a different point of view of how people perceive Richard and his army but I've found since the 4th book that there is a lot of ""philosophy"" and ""rambling"".If you liked the previous books this will probably be slightly disappointing.From the reviews I've read about the next in the series, I now realize I am going to put this series to rest.Thanks for the ride but this is my stop."
2,Terry Goodkind is turning out like Robert Jordan,"When I first picked up this series, I couldn't put it down. I would ride the train home from work and almost miss my stop. Now I have to force myself to get through it. I keep buying the books hoping that it will pick up, but I am beginning to doubt it will happen. I fear that Goodkind has taken the same path as Jordan and this series will never come to a satisfying conclusion."
2,the pillars of creation,"He did it again, instead of focusing on the main characters Terry Goodkind, has made me waste 20 dollars on what could and should be a seperate series. This was not a book in the series of the sword of truth, but a side story which could have been handled in a much smaller role."
1,A real let-down,"I was surprised at how bad this book was. I like Goodkind and I loved the rest of the series, especially Faith of the Fallen. It was a real shock to me, therefore, how disappointing this was. Some of the other reviewers have already mentioned some of the points that the book lacked. Richard and Kahlan were not to be seen until the end, the plot had huge, gaping holes, the book did nothing to carry on the general plot line Goodkind has established in the previous books. Much as I do at the end of a bad movie, I just wanted to get the time I wasted on the book back."
3,"Decent Book, not what I was expecting","Simply put, if I had read this book without reading the prior 3 or 4, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. Great authors in the genre(put your own favorites here) have a distinct knack for being able to make us care about characters OTHER than the main protagonist. Goodkind did that here. I even ended up liking Sebastian by the end of the book. The only problem was that I did spend the first 500 pages wondering when Richard and Kahlan were going to show up, and not as much paying attention to the story. I am figuring that most of you did the same. So what I would say is reread the book, firmly believing that Richard and Kahlan won't show up until the very end, and the story has nothing to do with them directly. Because the story isnt' about the Seeker, it's about the Pillars of Creation...."
2,"Episodic, repetitive and, at times, bad","I will not preface my review with caveats regarding how much I've enjoyed this series. If I'm reviewing book 7, that should be enough to know that I'm a fan. And since I know most of you who are reading this are already ""in the series"" I won't say not to buy it, because even if you believed me that the book is pretty awful, you would probably still go out and get it, if only to find out what happens to the characters you've been reading about.Well, you don't really find out anything and this series is looking more like a season of Three's Company: episodic, bad writing, and plots that revolve around miscommunication. Terry has lost me as a reader and, to be honest, he should lose you too. He shouldn't profit from such obvious profiteering. Which is way too bad because the series started out about as strong as one that I can remember."
1,Monolog,"There was no development of the characters beyond a couple of people. I would have liked to have seen and heard from the characters from the first set of stories before page 600. Only a few key characters were mentioned at all.This is one of those stories you can skip 10 or 50 pages at a time and you have not missed much. The author stayed with basically a one-person story line the entire book, which was not entertaining. It was mostly monolog (he thought this, she thought that and so on and so on), not much dialog or real action."
3,Overlong and frustrating,"While I am a fan of Terry Goodkind's series started with Wizards First Rule, I was disappointed with this installment in what is otherwise a fantastic series. Perhaps it was due to the long delay since I read Faith of the Fallen, but many of the references were obscure. Further, the adventures of Jennsen, while action packed, frustrated due to the obvious end of her plight. The story could have been half the length of this novel, told the same story, and been better for the thinning. Few new revelations appear in this novel, little interaction with old friends, and seemingly little impact on the overall plot arc. Perhaps the main character will play a greater role in future installments, we can only hope. As it stands this novel is a long, nearly dull aside that I worked to finish."
1,GARBAGE,"I love the Sword of Truth series but this has NOTHING to do with Richard and Kahlan! Its about some girl Jensson (Richards long lost sister of course)and is 700 pages about HER. I would not have minded if they hadnt charged the same price as the other sword of truth books. This book is a waste of time, skip it and buy the next one and just pretend that Jensson was always around and you will be fine.... I am so mad at Terry Goodkind. He gets one more chance, if ""The Naked Empire"" is not as good as Wizards First Rule or Faith if the Fallen, I will NEVER buy anything from him again!Skip this one, go read some G.R.R. Martin, he knows how to continue a series!!Relic113"
3,Interesting book,"Just like everyone else, I'm a Goodkind fan. I pre-ordered PoC and then I read some of the reviews. The book was ok, but the dustjacket summary is a bunch of BS. This book is not about Richard and Kahlan. It's about 2 new characters, and they aren't very interesting or even memorable characters. The only reason I'm not returning it is because I like to keep intact books of a series.I hope the next book is much better."
2,"Terry, I love you, but...","I am an avid fan of this series, and have read all of these books as they have come out. My enthusiasm is waning with the successive books. The impact of this book on the story line will not be known for a while, however this was a lot of time and effort devoted to only moderately interesting side characters. With a whopping pattern of two, Terry seems to be taking a side trip every other book, and it's somewhat frustrating. I loved book six, and I will continue to look into the series, but I am not inclined to spend my money on 400+ pages of moderately irrelevant side characters. To Terry: I'm sure you have publishers on you for quantity, but don't feel like you have to copy or compete with R. Jordan's endless repetitive detail. Write your own story, keep it tight and moving then finish it. Move on to other characters in other stories. 600 pages is too much for a side trip. Another book like this, and I may move to newer pastures."
2,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN CONNECTICUT,"I LOVED THE FIRST SIX BOOKS - RICHARD,KAHLAN,ZED AND THE GANG PROVIDED A NICE RELEIF FROM THE DAILY STRESS OF WORK - BOOK SEVEN SEEMS TO ABANDON THESE CHARACTERS - LEAVES ME WAITING AND HOPING FOR BOOK EIGHT"
2,Some good moments floating in a sea of mediocrity,"Glaring typographic errors, repeated phrases, huge plot discontinuities ...Man, but this book needed some serious editing. I don't know how many times Goodkind repeated the same basic thoughts in this book. Over and over, we read how Jennsen plans to ""plunge her sword into Richard Rahl's chest."" This exact phrase, or something quite similar, must appear ten times in the last part of the book. The book comes off as superficial and amateurish. If JRR Tolkien or Gene Wolfe is a 10 in terms of fantasy prose, then Goodkind is about a 2. On the other hand, there were some compelling moments, and I found the whole People's Palace sequence gripping."
2,Save some time,For those of you that have not read this book yet save yourself some money and just read the last 50 pages. This book had no business being apart of the Sword of Truth series. It should have come out as a stand alone like the Debt of Bones book. Or at least finish the series then write about the new characters. So this book has about 150 pages of good reading and the rest stinks. Terry you can do better than that and you should.
3,Pretty good.......but not quite up to his usual standard,"I'd first like to start by saying that the Sword of Truth series is best if you start at the beginning.....The latest book in the Sword of Truth series is quite suspenseful. However, unlike the other books in the series, it centers on the Richard's half-sister named Jennnsen. I don't like to take anything away from it, but I think it spends too much time on Jennsen's struggles. You really don't see much of the mighty duo of Richard and Kahlan until the last 64 pages, and most of the good stuff is there. A nice addition to the book was another of Richard's many half-brothers, named Oba, but this character makes the book seemingly overviolent (and over graphic). I suppose Mr. Goodkind is trying to portray the evilness of Darken Rahl's offspring, but then how are only Richard and Jennsen untouched?All in all, I felt this was much better than the ghastly Faith of the Fallen. I also recommend the Wheel of Time series for avid fantasy readers."
2,Worst book of the series,"This book .... Richard and Kahlan are barely in it. The story was predictable, absurd, and above all boring. I thought the last book a step in the wrong direction, but this is a pitch of a cliff. If the next book is not good within the frist 100 pages, I am quiting the series."
1,Dissapointed!,"I was very dissapointed with The Pillars of Creation. The book falls far short in the intricate relationships set in the Sword of Truth saga. The entire book was set, with few exeptions, in a world that could exist completely outside Richard and Kahlan's realm. Richard and Kahlan are vaguely mentioned and Zed has an extremely small part. The series did not progress at all, and I feel cheated. A minor saving grace is that we get a more in-depth look at Jagang.Overall, I felt the book did very little in regards to the Sword of Truth. I only hope that the next book will get the series back on track."
2,Dissappointed,"I think it was innovative to write the book from the perspective of new characters, but I read these books because of Richard and Kahland and with the hope that they will dipose the Imperial Order.From that perspective, this story fell flat on its face. Mr. Goodkind's story-telling is still exceptional and it was an interesting story. However, this book should not have been touted as part of the Sword of Truth series (even though there were a couple of chapters dedicated to Richard and Kahland).There we several plot flaws that can't be discussed without revealing spoilers. But they mostly happened near the end, like he was rushing to get it done, and forgot some of the pieces that had gone before. Even so, I did like the over-all ending."
2,A Total Disappointment,"Ugh. Please don't tell me that Terry Goodkind is losing his way like Robert Jordan. This book might as well have nothing to do with the rest of the series. It is bland and preachy. Once again, I say Ugh."
2,"Good read, but disapointing","the pillars of creation is a great read, and ive read ALL of TG's books, but this one was to centered on jensen. the whole book had less than a chapter with kahlan and richard, i was really disapointed. ... All in all this was a great read, and if you are a sword of truth fan you need to read it. but dont get your hopes up. ..."
3,A bit dry...,"Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is beginning to dwindle. In this book, The Pillars of Creation, Goodkind tells the story of Jennsen Rahl and Oba Rahl, Richard's brother and sister. Only at the end of the story do familiar characters come into the story.While it was somewhat refreshing to view the world of the Sword of Truth through different eyes, in the end, this book just didn't compare with the previous books in the series. Of its own right, the story was compelling and unfolded nicely, so I gave it three stars instead of two, but it is barely visible in the shadow of the books that came before it.Recommended for die-hard fans. Moderate or casual fans who don't particularly want to spend the time to read a 500+ page book could probably skip this one and not miss anything."
5,"I have enjoyed reading all of the ""sword of truth"" books.","I love Terry Goodkind. And I have been reading these books on my Amazon app on my phone, makes reading something I can do whenever I have even a few minutes."
2,Not Terrible.... But a long way from good.,"Meh. Poor world building. Idiotic villains, Unsympathetic and poorly written lead character... but readable.unfortunately suffers from one of the worst 3rd acts i've read in a while, and terrible, terrible, terrible dialog."
4,Simpel Review,"I enjoyed this book, but if you are new to Terry Goodkind and the Sword of Truth series make sure you reed the books that precede this one. Also these books are more than a simple sword or magic fight there are a lot of complex themes about society and these books will make you think and not know the ending until you read it."
2,least favorite so far,"Here's what I said about the previous book in the series -- it still holds true:""I picked up the first of the series from an Amazon suggestion. Each book in the series makes me want to read the next a little less. The writing itself seems more like what I had to read in Juvenile Literature while getting my teaching certificate, yet the events being described have too much sex and violence (combined into one at times) to be aimed at teenagers.""This latest preaches to the reader too much, but not by actually making the point about the dangers of communism or whatever he's trying to say."
4,The Pillars of Creation (Sword of Truth),"To date, I have only gotten just past half way, but it is not quite as good as the first 6 books. Hoping it will tie in with the original characters more soon. I'm sure it will. Love the series. Working my way through it. I believe there are 11 books in all."
2,Really took a detour on this one...,"Lauren comes up from out of nowhere in this book, and isn't a particularly entertaining character. I don't know if maybe Goodkind was trying something different, or thinking about taking the story in a different direction, or just drunk, but this was really not at all what I was hoping or expecting to read after reading all the previous books.I haven't read beyond this book as when I put it down, it was the newest book. There have been 3 or 4 more released since then, so I'm picking up the next one. If it continues this story line, I won't be likely to finish it, and certainly not likely to purchase the next one after that."
1,Disappointing,I found this to be a truly disappointing end to a pretty interesting series. It seemed as if Goodkind became bored with the whole story line and published something just to get it over with. I read all the other books in the series and was anxiously awaiting a grand finale. What a shame.
2,Filler,"While you get a tidbit or two of backstory out of this novel, you can pretty much skip it and not lose anything much. The main character of this book gets pretty much discarded in the next (or the one after?) one.The main characters only make cameo appearances and it may interest you (it was a boring read for me), it has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the series.This was merely a filler for book 8, and nothing more. The writing wasn't so hot either. It was almost as if it was another author. Don't let this book dissuade you from reading the ones after."
2,Too long-winded,"I could've skipped a few chapters of the book and not missed anything. In fact, you could, if you want to get through with this book quickly, read the first and last few chapters and it would just be as good a read as the whole book."
2,Not like the rest of the series,"Although I thought the story in this book was very good I thought that the deviation of using Richard and Kahlan as main characters really ruined the story for me. Since the rest of the books in the Sword of Truth series have Richard and Kahlan as the focus, not focusing on them in this book really left me with the sensation that the book was really missing something. Overall I was pretty disappointed with the book. I hope that Goodkind returns to Richard and Kahlan's story in the next book."
2,You can skip this one.,"All this book is good for is introducing Jenssen, Richards new sister, who ends up being nearly identical to him in charictor. Obe is so simeraler to Richard's other brother it's scary. You hardly get any of Richard fighting the order, you hardly see any of Richard at all. Instead of developing old charitors, Goodkind gives us new ones that I could care less for."
2,What was the motivation for this book?,"I must say I was pretty disappointed when I heard that Terry Goodkind was to release 7th installment for ""The Sword of Truth"" series. ""Faith of the Fallen"" had a perfect, non-Hollywood, ending, where it gave hope to a new beginning. Unfortunately, it seems that the writer could not just end it there, but instead started a completely new story that somehow lamely ties into the existing one. Seems to me like greed was the motivation for the book, not a new brilliant idea. And new plot is not what really bothers me. It is the quality of writing. It is repetitive, silly and obnoxious, and it read as fast as a bad romance novel. I do hope he will go back to the writing style which made the previous books in the series such good reads."
4,Very Good Book,"I think this book was very good. I am tired of hearing reviews that say they did not like it because it was not the sequel to Faith of the Fallen. Nowhere was it written that it WAS the sequel, so they should stop their whining. I think it is a very good book, but I wish Zedd, Richard and Chase were in it more. The characters the last couple books talked about are not in this until the few chapters so be warned"
2,Terrible book,"I have grown to love Terry and his writing with books 1-6. This one, however, makes me want to push fast forward on the audiobook. Its just terrible. I hate the new characters. I find myself wanted to bash their faces in. They are inhuman, and just plain, NOT INTERESTING. Why did he do this? If he wanted to spin off some lame books, then do it. This really does not tie into the main story arc at all. I'm not even sure I want to continue reading this book (or the series), as it is THAT PAINFUL to get through. Its almost as bad as Book 10 of WOT. What were you thinking Terry?"
2,"Save yourself some time, skip it","As many others have said, this book is a long and boring sidetrack from the main story. The entire purpose of the novel is to introduce Richard's half-sister, but I found myself completely unable to like her. I haven't read the next book yet, but if it's anything like this one, I may pretend that the series stopped at book 6."
2,Change doens't come easy.,Okay so what happened here. This is my 3rd real sci-fi/fantasy series I've read(the other two were the LOR saga and the DUNE saga(stillcomingout)(I was a fan of both before the movies were even in creating))and I really enjoy Goodkind's writing. But what happened here? Some like the change in style and the idea of holes in the world was intriguing(spelling?) and all but what did it have to do with the story? I wanted to hear more about Richard and Kahlans adventures instead of a bunch of strage offspring. I hope the next novels doesn't venture off to left field just to come up empty handed. I suppose it's a good idea to read this one but it leaves the ready with little energy and a sense of boredom.
2,disappointment,"The first third is fine, but then goes downhill....to the totally stupid ending. Trite bad guy ruins the basic story line and the ""hero"" does not ring true. Lots of repetition.On the good side; a nice story concept, the descriptions of animals are nicely done.Don't bother to spend the money."
3,"Not bad, not great","By the time you reach this book in the series, you have already grew attached to the main characters such as Richard, Zedd, Etc.. Sad to say these characters are MIA for 90% percent of the book. Once you get over that you are put in the story of 2 strangers that grow to find out who they really are through life changing experiences. I did find myself pretty interested though i always was waiting for the story to switch back to Richard and Co., which didn't happen till near the end of the book. Overall, it is a weaker Goodkind book but it still keeps you wrapped in, so i cant complain too much. A must read for any Sword of truth fan."
2,Disapponting,"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers who sounded disappointed with this book. I read the publisher's blurbs and read the book jacket beofre reading the book. After the first hundred pages or so, i went back to the jacket thinking I had missed something. Wasn't this supposed to be about Richard and Kahlan being pursued, etc? Maybe I wouldn't be so disappointed if I didn't feel like the readers were misled. Why not come out and say that this is a story focusing on characters other than Richard and Kahlan? Maybe the publisher realized if the truth about the focus of this book were identified up front, people would hesitate to spend the money on the hardback. Bottom line for me is that this was one more disappointment in this series that started out so well. I think buying used in the future is what's in order."
2,What the...?,"We wait all this time to find out what happens to Zedd and Richard and Kahlan and Cara, one of my personal favorites, and what do we get? A completely new story with all of our favorite heroes as afterthoughts! I was looking forward to this book with vigor; after all, ""Faith of the Fallen"" was a beautiful and stunning work written by a true writer. I cared deeply about Richard and Kahlan and Nicci, and wondered what would happen to them. And what do we get? A completely off-kelter story about people I don't even care about and undoubtedly never will! They would be great as a sub-plot, but really! You can't write 6 books about characters that your readers learn to care deeply about and then write a book about some other chick and her problems and sell it in the same series! Frankly, I don't really care to know about Jennsen and Oba and Sebastian and the sorceress dames. I eagerly await Terry Goodkind's next book, and hope its a hell of a lot better than this one."
3,"Good, but not great","This book was tough for me. I love Goodkind and this series. I came into it late, so i flew through books 1-10 in about 3 weeks. Up to this point, i became more and more enthralled with each book i read. It was not the case with this book. The book on its own is not a bad book by any means, but it doesn't really do anything to move the story along. The worst thing about this book isn't actually the book itself, but how hard it is to get back into the story when you start to read the next one. My dad read the books after I did, and actually skipped this one all together, and didn't feel like he missed anything. For the true Goodkind fans, all of his books are a must-read, but for everyone else, if you want to skip one, this is the one to do it on."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"When I first inserted the first tape into my player, I questioned whether or not it was the same series.Not till I got home and comfirmed it on the internet did I believe it.3/4 of this book is dedicated to two new character who could have been described in two chapters.I was very disappointed with this book.Mr Goodkind takes an entire book to identify two characters which he could have done in two or three chapters.The last 100 pages are appropriate and very interesting.The rest of the book existed just to make money.Shame on you Terry."
3,"Good, but no Great","Although I have been a long time fan of Terry Goodkind I found this book to have taken a very large side track to the main storyline of the Sword of Truth series. I found it frustrating reading each chapter hoping that the story would get on track. Each chapter I read made me more frustrated, not knowing what was going on in the main story line.I am not saying this book was bad, but it felt like it had no conection to the main story. I was hoping for some continuation of the the war with the Old World.I love the the Sword of Truth Series and I hope that the next book will continue with the war. In truth, this book could be bypassed while reading the series. I do not think that this book will have a tremendous amount of impact on books to come.I ecncourage everyone to read The Sword of Truth series, but I did not feel this book was worth the time and frustration that I endured."
1,NOT Sword of Truth,"I love the series, but I loathed this book. Putting aside the fact that the book doesn't include any of the 'main' characters from the SoT series, I found it largely boring. The only parts I found worth reading were the ones dealing with Jagang, and the last 50ish pages of the book. Goodkind sold out, and instead of actually continuing his already long story, he's added this book just to make some extra bucks. It is extremely frustrating to have waited for a book to complete/continue the SoT story, and instead be given this piece of....If this were the first book in the SoT series, I would NOT have purchased the second."
2,Big printing but less words.,"The thing that irritated me the most about this book wasthat the type and word spacing were so much larger thanall the previous books. Did the publisher think that wewere so dumb that we couldn't figure out that if you uselarger type and more spaces between the lines and the wordsthat you may end up with the similar amount of pages as theprevious books but you actually get a lot less words.The story was shorter than all the other books and it bugsme that they tried to cover it up by using larger type usuallyreserved for kiddie books. This book was a sell out by boththe author and the publisher. If it takes more time to do itright, then take more time !"
2,"zzz...huh?...zzz...oh, it's over!","There is a common theme in all these books...repetition...as if the author spends half the book discussing the previous books. I find myself waiting for those moments so I can skip ahead. After reading the series as released, I went back and read to read it again one after another...I just can't do it. If anyone gets a chance to read the Dark Tower series, at least the scenery changes."
1,Same review as for Naked Empire,"See my review of Naked Empire. In particular, do not buy any books in this series if you are from Canada."
1,Marks the end of the Goodkind era,"This is probably the worst book I have ever read.I've loved the first 6, and from this book onwards - and especially with this book - I find Goodkind's work to be totally empty and denuded of interest.I can't begin to understand why, as one of the other reviewers wrote ""did he even write this book"" ?. I personnaly believe that success made Goodkind fall head over heels into self-admiration and lust to sell more, to the detriment of his books' quality. The plot is staightforward, the characters unsurprising and simple, the ""philosophical"" (I would rather quote this term in this context) statements simplistic, boringly long, and frankly laughable.I read the two following 'Pillars of Creation' : 'Naked Empire' and 'Chainfire', which are a little better. To tell the truth, I felt that I was taken hostage and forced to read these books because I so much liked the previous ones that I bought all three at once.These will definetely be the last Goodkind I read"
4,Interesting but confusing,The book was confusing but it put in a lot of information on Richards goals of magic and what he wants to do for his kingdom. It also shows some more facts on Darken Rahl which is interesting because it shows what Richard is still trying to fight against. It does not mention a lot about Richard and Kahlan but it is still interesting and it has a lot of connection with past books. It definitly kept me in suspense for the upcoming books.
1,Wait for the paperback edition,"Faith of the Fallen read like Atlas Shrugged if Ayn Rand had been a romance author with little writing ability. Unfortunately Pillars of Creation is no better. Perhaps I could see past the bland writing if the story and characters were compeling. However the character development is superficial as the characters tend to be bland and predictable. I've read nutrition panels on cereal boxes with a more intriguing plot than this book! If you must read the Sword of Truth series, then I definitely suggest you wait for the paper copy. I wish I could get my 27 dollars back."
4,too short,"I love the Sword of Truth series... as always, I end up craving for more! Once I got started, I can't bring myself to put it down. I do feel that a lot of the interesting stuff got crammed into the last few chapters and that too much of the story centered on Jennsen. Other than that, I think this book is an excellent addition to the series."
1,goodkind= clown of the year,"Goodkind really should of stayed with ripping off ideas from Jordan, but i guess sense jordan is on the decline he had to actuelly do some work. well Faith of the fallen had me convinced goodkind was going to make a series out of this soarly lacking Plot progression, However this new instalment is not even worth the read.Goodkind talks about his books being about these ""charecters"" but yet prolly the main reason anyone reads this series is to see richard and kahlan, well this isnt a spoiler, its a warning not to buy the hard cover because None of the main charecters are in the majority of the book.I am hoping my last regrett of 2001 is buying the hard cover version of this book, I hope you dont make a simliliar regrett in buying even the paper back come next year.I for one wont pick up the next books by him..."
4,Very Good - Terry Goodkind is the best current author,"I compare this book to the section in the Lord of the Rings where Frodo visits Tom Bombadil: it is a good part and it is enjoyable, but I am always anxious to get on with the main story.Goodkind has very good stories that are extremely enjoyable. He gets tedious when he keeps hammering Jennsen's hatred of Richard Rahl. I find his books quite uplifting, which has become unusual lately in fantasy.I definitely think Goodkind is the best epic fantasy writer out there right now. Robert Jordan is getting nauseating; the only reason I can continue the WOT books is a faint hope he might return to good writing.I highly recommend this book to fans of Goodkind."
2,Not the best of the series.,"I must say after reading this bookk the first thing that comes to mind is good try. I, like many, am a advid follower of the Sword of Truth Series, however I did not enjoy this installment. I liked the idea of introducting a character at odds with the fundemental virtues that the main characters strive to uphold. However, Jenssen, nor Oba were the characters to do it. I found Jenssen's gullible nature a little to convient in allowing her to be so easily lead by someone who is, in essence, a complete stanger to her despite the warnings and training of her mother. I find Oba to be a weak willed brute with little to offer in the way of true opposition to the struggles of the series main characters. I think Mr. Goodkind had a good idea to base this chapter of the series on, but fell short of developing the idea fully."
2,Very disappointing,"Having just finished The Pillars of Creation, I'm left wondering, ""Is this the same story that's summarized on the dust cover?"" It was excellent until the last 75 pages, where it all falls apart. It's as if Mr. Goodkind got tired of writing. I kept looking to see if I had missed entire chapters of Richard and Kalhan's adventures, which are only hinted at. A very disappointing ending to what had the potential of being on of the series best."
1,This is not a Sword of the Truth series book.,"I feel like some other writer has decided to write a book. After the first 50 pages with nary a mention of Richard or the Mother Confessor. I wasn't worried though because Goodkind has done that to us in the past. However, 500 some pages into the book and still nothing?? What is Goodkind thinking? People read the book for the characters that they love, not strangers with whom we do not empathize with or care about. Goodkind had better come out with a book as good as Faith of the Fallen next time or his readership will suffer tremendously."
2,Enough meandering,Terry Goodkind really broke away from his story line on this one. For the first 200 pages I kept waiting for his main characters to appear and the story to start but it didn't happen until the last 20 pages. Disapointing. It felt as if he lost interest in the Sword of Truth line and decided to try something new. It didn't work.
1,Disappointing,"I love his books, they usually are very complex. This book was a short story with a very shallow plot. Did he have to get a book out for Christmas?"
1,Terribly Disappointing,"I ""was"" a huge fan of the series but this book is a disappointing entry into the Sword of Truth series. The book does little to advance the storyline/plot that the Sword of Truth series advances. The review of the plot makes it appear Richard is a major player in this series when in fact he is only around for the last 50 pages and that is less than a tenth of the book. Clearly some money hungry person be it the author or the publisher thought this book deserved to be a part of the series. The tricks of Robert Jordan are clearly evident here which makes sense as tehy share the same publisher, Tor Books. I think authors should not allow themselves to be duped into this thought process. I for one never by the Jordan books, I just get them from my library... in paperback and would recommend you do the same for this book or borrow a friends and save your money."
2,Food for thought but wait for the paperback,"I too was very disappointed because I love the main characters so much and was looking forward to spending time with them. However, the one thing Goodkind does well is kinda give you moral food for thought and the message in this book is: what happens if you base your life on assumptions/beliefs that are entirely false? Made me kinda want to examine mine and I also felt it also might have an implications in understanding how 9/11 happened. Just my opinion."
3,Slow going - average at best,I really like the series but this book did little for me. It filled in a few blanks but is mostly a 760 page tangent that rejoins the mainline story in the final chapters. It does introduce some interesting new characters and an interesting new capability but I still found it slow going.
2,It's ok,"This was a ok book. It personally disappointed me. Cause the entire time its about these 2 other people and I kept expecting Richard or Nathan or SOMEBODY different than these two. Richard and Kahlan finally step in at the VERY end of the book. Now don't get me wrong I would still have read the book if I knew all of this before hand. Cause, you do learn a few good things and also the set-up for the next book. So I recommend you read it, but just don't be expecting that much excitement. I often had to force myself to read it."
2,Don't Bother,"I love the Sword of Truth series (except the chicken one, I still don't know what that was all about.) Then I read Faith of the Fallen and I was hooked again desperate to read the sequel. When I picked up Pillars of Creation I thought that's what I had. Boy was I wrong! I don't mind reading about a new character, but she shouldn't have more than a few chapters dedicated to her. In a Sword of Truth book, of approximately 550 pages, neither Richard or Kahlan appear until the last 50, and they don't play that big a role in those pages either. This wasn't a sequel, it was a cash grab. I'm just glad I read a library copy and didn't buy it. Terry Goodkind must be running out of ideas if Pillars of Creation is all he can give us. I'd rather have waited another year or two for him to come up with something worthwhile. Am I willing to risk wasting my time again and read the next book? Sadly yes, because I'm still looking forward to the sequel to Faith of the Fallen. Hope I get it next time."
3,"Good, but not his best","It seems like Terry is running out of steam. Although his dialogue is certainly getting much better, his ideas and characters have been losing their depth. Although I normally whole-heartedly recommend his books, I can't recommend this one.Spoiling the story, just a bit -- Richard isn't the main character in this one. He shows up at the end, with a bit of deus ex machina used to wrap up the story. There wasn't really a story arc, or any actual character development. Most of what was going to happen wasn't well foreshadowed -- it wasn't a surprise, but that's because of heavy-handedness, not foreshadowing.In brief -- worth reading if you've read the rest, but wait for the paperback unless you NEED to complete that hardcover collection."
1,Hooray for libraries,"This stinkbomb series is great. It really reminds me that if you're in doubt about the book, you can check it out at the library instead of buying it. Support your local library!Lucky for Richard his enemies are dumb and cartoonish, too bad for us I guess."
3,What happened Terry?,"What happened Terry? After waiting for this book to come out for a year, anticipating more action from Richard and Kahlan, we get some story about a person we know nothing about. I was expecting richard and kahlan to have a kid, nathan to play a major role, and Zedd to begin teaching Richard how to be a wizard. I was extremely disappointed, and hope that this book some how plays a key role in the future books in the series, otherwise it was a total waste!"
2,What happened?,"Terry Goodkind is one of my favorite authors. As so many other fans, I eagerly awaited his new book. But after reading 300 pages, I couldn't believe the main characters hadn't been indoctrinated into the story! What happened? Those characters have been the focus and magic of the whole series. To leave them out of the book until the last 75 or so pages, was a disgrace! This is a definite ""wait for paperback"" novel."
1,"Don't Bother. I liked Wizard's First Rule too, but the series just gets horrible","This book is really lousy. As I said in other reviews, the first book in the series was excellent.The next 3 ranged from almost good to decent. But they just kept getting progressively worse until you hit this piece of garbage. The story has become so convoluted that its just not worth reading anymore.This one has NOTHING to do with Richard and Kahlan in case you are wondering. Just some random side story the author decided to throw in. Seriously, quite horrible..."
1,Also disappointed...,"While I understand the value of looking at this world from a completely different perspective, this story is flat. Seeing others struggle through the world that Richard, Kahlan, Zedd and the others are stuggling to uplift lends a new angle, but I agree with many others that Jennsen and Oba are flat, one dimensional characters, and the pace of the story has peaks and valleys like a bunny hill. Still, I do look forward to the following books in the series. This installment, however, can be summed up in one word: FLAT."
1,What series did this story come from?,"I was very disappointed with the plot of this book. When you see that a book is the next volume of a SERIES...you expect that it would continue with the original plot. This book however goes off on a completely different tangent with only a ""cameo"" apperance of the original characters.I can only hope that the next one does continue the original story, but I will be sure to skim through it BEFORE I buy it."
4,A good read,"I disagree with the other reviewers - I think this was one of the best books in the series. The story had a depth to it of Jennsens' metaphorical death and rebirth that I found wonderfully written. Yes, Kahlan and Richard are only there are the end, but it was refreshing to see D'Hara through the eyes of another character, and Jennsen's growth as a charcter is well written. Cara, Richard and Kahlan border on charicatures sometimes, and it was nice to get away from them for a bit. Goodkind's preaching about individual rights does get tiresome, but it is limited in this novel."
3,Not really a Sword of Truth novel,"I was actually disapointed with this book, I always look forward to the next installment in the Sword of Truth series. Terry Goodkind is one of my most favorite authors, his style makes you love the characters and even feel for them. This book is well written, but the introduction of and focus on the new characters is a sad departure from the series. I suppose the next book in the series will show what Mr. Goodkind was attempting to set up with this book. In short, it is well written but if you are looking for the characters you know and love, check in the last couple of chapters and skip the whole first part of the book."
2,Did Goodkind write this unsatisfying book himself?,"Another reviewer summed this book up: ""It began in a long drawn out fashion and ended in a whirlwind of events that made little sense. Shame on you Terry Goodkind.""That Kahlan and Richard are barely in the book is fine, although it's better to know that before reading it.What is not fine is that the first 400 pages are filler while the last part of the book needed 200 more pages to make any sense at all. The overall plot and narrative are embarrassingly weak. Bottom line: The quality of this effort is an insult to faithful readers.Will I read him again? Yes, but I'm in no hurry."
3,More torture?,"Terry Goodkind continues to tortured the fans of the Sword of Truth Series with another ""good"" book that does very little to move the plot of the series forward. He introduces a few new characters and almost doesn't mention the main characters of the series (Richard and Kahlan). I enjoyed the last few chapters of the book but it was a long read to get there.Based on the previous books in this series, I have high expectations for this author and he failed to meet those expectations with this book."
4,Good but needs more,"Well it wasn't what I expected, but it was good. The one thing I didn't like was how it dragged on for most of the book and then the last 50 pages have all of the great action, with exception to the order battle against Adie and Zed. Those last 50 pages should have been told in more detail and used at least 200 pages. Another thing, I want to know what Richard and Kahlan were doing the whole time. Hopefully the next book will fill us in. The way I see it, the next book should be the last with the order trying to take the people's palace. If Goodkind tries to drag it out any longer than that, I will be very disappointed. I will be anxiously waiting for the last brilliant novel to bring it all together and then conclude it."
4,"This Book is Great, Brings out more from the series!!!!!","When I first started reading this book, I was just like everyone else, wondering what had ahppened to Richard and Kahlan. But, I have to say this book is well worth the money and time. A new and worthy character has been added to the community, we learn more about Terry's world and learn more about his world's precarious balance with magic and life.Yet, I gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars for the reason of lacking much about what has happened to Kahlan and Richard throughout this time, these are the focus of the other books and that needs to be kept."
1,Very disappointed!,"I can't understand what Goodkind was doing in this book. Why write #7 in a series and then leave out the main characters from the previous novels for 90% of the book. Goodkind is perhaps my favorite author, but this book makes no sense. Everyone I have talked to about this book feels the same. What was he AND his editor thinking? Read the last 50 pages, and cross your fingers for book #8. Maybe it will actually have some characters that we want to read about."
1,BARELY STARTED IT AND I WANTED TO SET IT ON FIRE!,"im not done with the book yet im about in the middle but every page i read is a struggle that tries to put me to sleep. Richard nd kahlan are barely even mentioned let alone brought into the story, its not a sword of truth book in my opinion its a book about this girl jennsen that just happens to take place in the world of the sword of truth DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK"
4,wolf-garten cultivator,This is strong and well made. I used it some in areas where the soil isn't packed and it works great. I wouldn't recommend it if your soil is packed or clay.
5,Wolf garten,These are the ultimate in garden tools! This cultivator is especially wonderful. They were given to me as a gift from my son-in-law and I have lots of the handles and attachments. You will not regret purchasing this product.
4,Terrific Pictures & Poetry,"I love the novels of John Updike and was curious to read one of his children's books. As always, Updike has produced a book of high quality. Each month is represented in a four- or five-stanza poem and has two illustrations. What I like about Updike is his obvious love of language, and he doesn't disappoint here. My favorite line is for July, ""And Tabby dozes/in a pool/ of fur she sheds/ to keep her cool."" What a beautiful summation of July!Originally written in 1965, the book was re-released in 1999 with new illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman. The pictures are stunning and capture the elements of each month. Readers of Updike know that he lives in Massachusetts, and the poems and illustrations have a decidely northeastern feel. Most highly recommended for young readers (ages 4-8 years) as well as their parents who enjoy evocative poetry!"
4,Lovely,"A lovely introduction to the seasons in New England, for children and adults alike. The clean and graceful watercolors perfectly complement the crisp text."
5,"""A Child's Calendar""","I'd recommend John Updike's ""A Child's Calendar"". Many readers associate Updike with his award-winning ""Rabbit"" series, which is not about cute little bunnies. Nevertheless, Updike scores big with this lovely collection of poems for children. Each month has a beautiful illustration and a timely poem.Author of ""Hobo Finds A Home"", Editor,""Of A Predatory Heart"""
1,"Hate the poems, hate the illustrations","I don't know why this won a caldecott honor medal. The pictures are depressing. The children and adults depicted are never shown smiling, they always look unhappy! The poetry is not much better, it is not enjoyable to read and most of the rhyme seems forced. I wish I would have looked more closely at this item before purchasing."
5,channeling Ayn Rand,"Move over, John Ross and Vin Suprynowicz! There's a new libertarian author in town. Steve Taylor's novel of a hopelessly deluded and corrupt Federal administration aiding the invasion by a newly totalitarianized Russia, and the self-organized resistance which fought them, is a must-read. If Ayn Rand had written Red Dawn - and were (thankfully) more terse doing it - this would be the result."
5,A Love Affair with Small Waters,"Those who love Gene Logsdon's work will definitely want to add this book to their library. Along with his usual contrary take on proper pond building methods, he conveys the beauty, diversity, and endless joy generated by a small pond of water. If you've not read Mr. Logsdon, then this is a wonderful introduction to his work. Anyone who has enjoyed dangling their toes off a dock, frog hunting in the cattails, or fishing on a sunny spring day will appreciate this book."
4,Street Smart!!!,"This is a pretty bumpin album...Tight for the most part...Not enough Tommy Wright III on it but if you like Memphis Rap you should swoop it...If your new to Tommy Wright III/Street Smart Records I'd Recomend Manson Family,Genisis,Feel Me Before They Kill Me and On The Run before you baught this album..."
5,"Never had Gooseberry, but IT IS good!",A pleasant surprise because I had no idea what Gooseberries were going to taste like. We all actually wound up eating it from a bowl with ice cream! So much for Gooseberry pie! Next time!
1,Second Coming,"The dialog, graphics and acting are about as poor as one can find. This is one of those films which is promoted so well andsucceeds in only leaving the viewer with one question - Why did I waste my money buying this? In my opinion, no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
3,Worth watching. Way too many similarities to politics today,"This movie is not great but it is worth watching.Everytime I hear the President use the use the term ""the citizenry . . .,"" or ""the citizens"", I think about this movie. He sounds way to much like the religious right president in this movie.No, we are no where close to the premise coming true but there are enough similarities with current events to make this movie worth watching.The movie is strongly left-wing. So the irony of critizing the religious right while embracing an equally totalatarian alternative is a big detraction.But once you get past the left wing politics of the script, there is a part of this movie that works and thus makes worth your time.As other reviewers suggested, there is no sex to speak of in this movie (which based on the cover you might expect there to be). Watch this if you want a short but provactive movie that will at least make you think."
4,Meh... basic pass,"To a film that totally sucked more in its time than a prostitute her entire life, I have to say, the soundtrack is ok... though must of the music can be found IN OTHER ALBUMS/CD'S!Oh, and can someone tell me why on earth the songs, ""The Girls and Boys"" by the Head Boys, and ""Green Mind"" by Dink were excluded - well, rather replaced with other music NOT from the film?!I think the only songs I am ok with would be songs like Crystal Taliefero's ""Love Will Shine on Me,"" and I guess I do find the Farm's 1991 single, ""All Together Now,"" pretty cool... yet they used a DIFFERENT variant in the film than that of the CD.Also, prior to - if you could call it this - the songs from the film, I also find Jay Ferguson's score to be ok as well, seeing how I am a fan of electric works.All together... I do not want to be too cruel, so I give this CD a 4/5-Albert"
1,be afraid....be very afraid,"On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I give this book a ""2"". One point for actually being published and one point for the possibility that it may help or illuminate even one person. Key word here is ""possibility"".To me and mine, the information in Klemp's book is for the novice, the beginner, and the 3rd grader who just had their 1st dream and asks...""duh, what's this?"" It's also for those folks who have read very little, or nothing, about organized religions, spiritual groups, cults and philosophical teachings, much less dreaming in and of itself. His book provides generic, albeit silly, vignettes about his group, Eckankar. So buyer beware, or in the least pickup a few other books to balance out what you read in this Eck epistle."
5,great love for God,"the book showed that dream is a real life.we never know it is a dream until we wake up.writing dreams down or recording them will help increase your dream experience.A theoritical physicist once said that 'the word REALITY makes me nervous"". he implied that many things we think are not real, are more real than the things we think are real.great spiritual book by the author SRI HAROLD KLEMP.The book showed that anybody can visit heaven temporarily in dream. WHY WAIT."
2,Spiritual Dreaming,"This is more of a beginners introduction to using dream interpretation for healing and spiritual insights than an extended reference book. It was an easy read although I became irritated by the continual references to whether a person was or was not a student or member of ECK. The references distracted from the message of using dreams to expand your awareness and began to preach the benefits of belonging to the religion.My main problem is the religion's practise of allowing the Dream Master, the ECK's spiritual leader, access to your dream world - to guide and protect the novice dreamer. I prefer a different method."
1,so deceiving!,"DON'T BUY this book if you are serious about dreams. If you are looking for a brain wash, go ahead and buy it!It has nothing to do with lucid dreams, but with the sect he leads.This book is disappointing and deceiving."
1,I would not recommend this,Does not cut as advertised. It might look easy on the video but you would have to apply lot pressure to cut the wood..I would give seller 5 rating..For the product i would give 1
2,"doesn't cut well, dull blade","should have known at such a great price, this cutter is just not up to par. the blade is not sharp at all. gave it two stars because i was able to remove the guide and use it on a good pair that the guide had broken on."
4,nice tool,"I bought this tool to cut popsicle sticks for a craft project. It works well, but does require some force to cut the sticks. I would buy it again."
3,"Long enough, but can the video equipment support it?","I wanted this cable to connect my computer's ATI 3800 to my Visio television. The cable was reasonably priced and long enough to reach across the living room. Unfortunately, it is so long that the video card and the TV didn't recognize that there was a device at the other end of the cable. I think that this cable might be too long to use without using some sort of amplifier/repeater."
1,Light Impressions,"Placed an order in January showed it was in stock, company immediately charged my credit card. Was told later that items were not in stock and may take 8 to 10 weeks. Canceled order 1/31 told it would take 7 to 10 days to receive a credit to my card. It is now 32 days later and still no refund. As it appears to me right now Light Impressions has taken my money and will not return it."
5,Perfect,Books received in record time and in excellent condition. Perfect to add to our great grandson's library - books his mama had when she four years old.
4,"A nice reunion, but not perfect","Reunion movies tend to have their faults. This one is no exception, although I would think it was better than average. Yes, they go with the silly 'the kids are taking over Dad's job, and Dad sneaks around to make sure they don't screw up' plot. However, this really shines in the same place the original series did -- the interaction and dialogue between Cosby and Culp. After all this time, they were still being those characters! Yes, while the scene where they are tied up naked might have been a little more fun if they had been a bit younger *cough*, it led to a wonderful scene. The young stars are pleasant enough, and do their best with what they're given."
3,"Ok return attempt, would have liked to see more","It was ok for a return series, it would have been great if the made more. I prefered the original series,and also would have like more of that series."
3,A painfully obvious TV series pilot...,"Yes, as someone who loved the original series, it was nice to see these two actors again; Culp and Cosby had real chemistry on the screen. But what spoiled the movie for me most was that this was so obviously an attempt to spin off a new TV series based on the new Kelly/Robinson characters. If you're an ""I Spy"" fan and haven't seen this movie, then you will certainly want to have a look. But you'll probably only watch it once, so get it as cheap as you can. Better yet, see if your local library can get it for you through interlibrary loan."
4,"This dvd is the same show as ""Live at Ronnie Scott's""","Although, this is one of my favorite DVD performances by Nina Simone I just felt it was necessary to inform any other potential buyer/collectors that if you already own the ""Live at Ronnie Scott's"" DVD than you already own the identical material found on this DVD. This is just the (all region) import version of the same performance with a different cover and was released by a different distributor. I am a big Nina Simone fan so I am trying to collect as much material as possible. If you don't own either version you can go with either one they are the same quality (a little grainy). The quality doesn't matter the minute she starts singing. It is absolutely amazing!"
3,Great! (but where's the track I really want?),"In the movie (within the first 15 minutes), Gere's character, Martin, meets a client in a billiard club. There's a wonderful (Italian?) song playing in the background. Martin comments on how beautiful it is and the mobster gives him a copy of the CD. Why is THAT track not included on this album?! Where can I locate a copy?"
3,Cano do Mar - The song to listen.....,"The surprise of this movie soundtrack is without a doubt ""Cano do Mar"" performed by Dulce Pontes. This portuguese song is ""FADO"" in a new modernized version. Dulce manage to grasp the spirit of an entire country in an almost hypnotic way. This track is a must......"
2,Dulce Pontes,Actually that song Cancao do mar is on the sound track. The song that is being played in the billiard hall is not on the soundtrack and I don't know anything about it. Does anyone know anything about it?
2,"Great seat, inexcusable base","The Pearl base is cheaply made despite it appearing to be heavy-duty, is the opposite of road worthy. When I first got it, I was impressed with the qiuck release height adjustment and bought one for a club I play at regularly. Granted, this club presents 2 bands a night 7 days a week, but the Pearl base was destroyed within a couple of weeks. Not just the tightening hardware, but the base itself was completely falling apart. The seat is still in great shape and is still being used at the club with a generic brand simple design heavy-duty throne base..."
1,Poor life & service,"I bought 2 of these batteries and they both died within a few months of light use. I have Power2000 batteries for my T2i and it works great, I think these are a knock-off or they got swapped by the supplier. It was too cheap to fight over so I just threw them out."
5,Always carry an extra battery,"When I go to visit new places, or friends, I'm glad I have an extra battery. You never know when your going to need a spare battery, so you don't miss that shot, you want. Sometimes your friends do strange things, candid shots are the best, and funnest."
3,Only equivalent in shape and color,"Battery is rated at 900mah as opposed to OEM Canon NB-4L (760mah). You should theoretically be able to operate the camera for longer periods. However with the same camera (Canon SD300) settings and flash operation, the OEM Canon lasts considerably longer for a given full charge. Good emergency battery for the price, (you can't use AA's in an Elph) but stick with the OEM for performance."
1,I DON'T recommend this book as it is very lacking!,"I bought this book hoping that I could learn a lot. The full color pictures and the catagorizing of the pictures by each line was very inticing. However the book left me very disappointed. For example, I wanted to read my life line, however I could not find a picture that matched mine. You were left picking what KINDA looked like it. Say though you found something that matched. You turn to the number that is indicated and read what your line means. You get about two lines of information before the reading starts turning toward information about that particular hand that is pictured. It was very irritating!!!I recommend you get something like Runic Palmistry!!! That was a wonderful book."
2,"Bland, Middling Folk-A3","She's an attractive woman and I know she's big in Ireland but here in the US, her appeal escapes me beyond her looks - I suppose the British might feel the same way about the US artist Jewel. She sounds vaguely like Nancy Griffith but she her voice is mostly, at best pleasant but the bigger problem that she sings EVERY track in one montone voice without any emotion or even a key change (unlike Nancy Griffith) ... then you compound weak lyrics and weak melodies - and you pretty much have nothing very distinctive. It's not horrible, it's just bland, slight and at best - pleasant. So, fine if you're seeing her live at a coffee shop but just listening to her on a CD? Not much to recommend on a disc that purports to be her ""greatest hits."""
2,Disappointment with this production,"JDF is the saving grace in this production as far as I am concerned. I found myself frustrated at the complete lack of movement for one thing - singers constantly rooted to the spot individually or in lines. The lighting was also dreadfully dull. In short, there was little visually appealing in this production. Its not one I will put on again too often - as one earlier reviewer advised ... go back to the CD collection and enjoy some fine singing without the frustrating and uninspiring visual impact."
3,Florez triumphs!,"Florez and D'Arcangelo are great! Machaidze is good, but I can't get Netrebko's Metropolitan Opera performance out of my mind as being the more definitive portrayal of Elvira."
5,Love these,These are so cute. I use the sugar bowl every morning for my grapefruit. I wish Pfaltzgraff would bring the Circle of Kindness pattern back.
1,Pass it by,"I suppose I was taken in by ""AMISH"" on the label. The bags of popcorn I received were of a rather low quality. Excessive hulls and 'teeth breakers'. Bought this to replace the Archer's white popcorn no longer available anywhere it seems, but there's no comparison. Going back to the Jolly Time yellow which is not bad at all."
5,Very happy,The item was just as expected. Very easy to install and set up.It works perfectly - the light goes on everytime the door is opened and off when closed.Just bear in mind that your supply outlet needs to be close to the closet door - the cord doesn't go very far.We had to use an extension cord for our setup.So glad I made this purchase.
5,Great Idea!,"This works great! You need to have an outlet nearby. Finally, I can ""see the light"" inside my pantry! Easy to install too."
5,Automatic Closet Light,"This low tech item is an exercise in brilliance: simple, effective, long-lasting. I couldn't find one at the big box, or small box, stores anywhere, and had to order it on line. The shipping was almost as much as the item. But it works great, Mom loves it in her pantry. I've had one in a linnen closet for 25 years. Great buy."
4,DVD PURCHASE,"This is a fine movie, but still not the one I saw in 1974. I love the movie, but I will still be looking. A great Purchase."
4,Nice Bag,"I had a pouch strapped to the handle bars (above the ignition) which works well for loose stuff I might need access to. However, Because I can't see THROUGH the pouch I have left the key in the ignition SEVERAL times and run my battery flat! Yes, I am a bonehead!This tank bag will replace the pouch and (hopefully) help remind me to remove the dang key!The bag is small. Wallet+phone+mp3 player. Maybe add a small pill bottle. You could swap out one of those items for a pack of smokes if you're so inclined.It's small enough to toss in a saddlebag. You could even stash it in your helmet if you leave that on your bike. It wouldn't be seen and hopefully not attract attention. Anything that looks like it will store something is a target."
2,Bizarre Film in Flynn's Later Career,"ISTANBUL is a bizarre piece of work, starring a clearly overweight and raddled Errol Flynn as a romantic hero caught up in a web of intrigue in 1950s Istanbul. He sleepwalks through the film, a pale shadow of his former self. The locations are of interest to anyone either unacquainted with the city of Istanbul, or to those who would like to know what it looked like before the developers changed its vista forever. John Bentley, a stalwart British B-Movie actor of the mid-50s, looks uncomfortable playing a Turkish police inspector, as he should be. For aficionadoes only."
1,Not even a hint of the old Flynn charm in this dud,I really felt sorry for Errol watching this movie. He looks so uncomfortable and doesn't seem to know what to do with his hands. Count how many times a double is used for Flynn in even the most routine shots-like walking into a building. They hired a unit to shoot some location stuff but didn't bother to send the cast. I'm starting to yawn just thinking about this deadly dull waste of time. Nat King Cole is great for 5 minutes in Technicolor but the rest of the picture stinks.
2,When I Fall Asleep,"Possibly in an attempt to give this sad little epic a ""Casablanca"" flavor, Nat Cole sings ""When I Fall in Love"" about sixteen times, while bleary-eyed Errol Flynn tries to get a bead on lost-yet-not-quite-lost love, gorgeous Cornell Borchers (what's with that name? sounds like a Russian sneezing). There's also something about a fire and some lost diamonds, or pearls, or gold... I wasn't really paying attention. If you're looking for Flynn at the end of his tether, try to find a bootleg of the glorious ""Big Boodle"" or the truly awesome ""Cuban Rebel Girls,"" both filmed in pre-Castro Cuba and both highly enjoyable provided you have enough rum handy."
5,Nothing short of amazing,"My elderly mother has very thin skin that tears easily, and she is somewhat accident-prone. A few months ago she had a 2 sq.in. scrape that tore away the top layer of skin. I was afraid it was going to take a very long time to heal so I put a Duoderm patch on it and arranged for a nurse to come check it out. The wound had already started healing before the nurse arrived a couple of days later! It only took about a month to be completely healed over. Recently, she had another minor accident that left a gash on her leg. I didn't have any patches so I dressed it with Telfa pads for a few days, without seeing a whole lot of improvement. I switched to the Duoderm patches when they arrived, and within 48 hours the wound had nearly closed -- remarkably faster healing than when I was using the regular dressing. Needless to say, I learned my lesson. I will never run out of these again!"
4,Great Product,"These dressings are great, letting wounds heal while protecting them from hazards and from getting wet. My order for a box of 5 was shipped without the box or informational inserts that are normally included."
5,Excellent,"I love Cornelia's Thief Lord, and Inkheart. This is just another excellent read in her writing career. I have an ARC, so I am not going to give the story away as it hasn't come out yet, but I am sure you will enjoy this as much as I .."
1,Abysmal,"I was born into a family of avid fantasy lovers, and naturally I became one too. This book, compared to any other notable literary work of the fantasy genre, is horrendous. The dialogue is just... heinous. It is so clichè, it makes me cringe. You'd expect Little Foot and his other Land Before Time buddies to be conversing, instead of the main characters of this particular book. The plot is acceptable, the character development is satisfactory, but the dialogue is appalling. To anyone older than 9 - do not bother."
1,Impersination...,"Everyone Who is suspicious about Dragon Rider being an impersination is well, I'm leaning towards right. Christopher Paolini started to write Eragon when he was 15. He published it in 2002. Corniela Funke published Dragon Rider in 2001 so Christopher might have passed his work on to other writers and, Funke might have written down some thoughts.I have seen this book, and from the size of Eragon compared To Dragon Rider I think Eragon has a lot more work into it. Many have written that It is too cute, and fuzzy.Eragon is graphic and better.Overall,Get Eragon,Not Dragon Rider"
1,Eragon Ripoff!,"I am a steadfast eragon lover, and when I saw this ""story"" in the store I gawked. I did not and will not pick this book up because it is a complete rip off to Eragon, Anne Mcaffrey and many more people I will not say. But all I can say is that I am going to judge this book by its cover and im not goiung to read a word in it.If you want a real book try reading Eragon!"
5,Read this book.....,"Dragon Rider is an awesome tale of valiant creatures and horrendous villains. Ben, the main character is an orphan boy who clings to a spectacular silver dragon named Firedrake, along with Sorrel who is a ferocious cat like creature. Nettlebrand, a towering gold contraption, is hunting down all the silver dragons. Terrified the gang sets out for the Rim of Heaven, where the dragons lived long ago. Along with pixies, sandman and even sea serpents, this work of art is filled with adventure, bravery and big words. Cornelia Funke is such a creative author. She just keeps building off one idea and will keep you in suspense. There is so much character development throughout the entire novel. Read this book and see how a orphan boy becomes a courageous Dragon Rider."
3,"Good and creative, but lacks character","Dragon Rider was a fine book over all. I'd rate it three stars because most of the characters are boring. A few have that spark that makes them more believeable, but the majority do not. The plot is creative and exciting. It makes for a good, if light read."
4,"True Fantasy, yet foolish for people older than 9","Everybody loves a book with Dragons and Brownies Rats and many other fantastic fantasy. Yet the story is extremely childish. Yes I know it was a children's book, but that's not what I mean, I mean anyone over nine years of age will find this an extremely boring book.The story is well written and has many plot lines, but everyone wants to help the Dragon and Dragon Rider, when in real life no one wants to pet a huge dragon.I say it's horrible for people over nine years old, but if you aren't read it because you will live it!"
2,Ehh,Not so good as I thought but her other ones are better. Try Inkheart or Kingdoms and the Elves instead.
5,Dragon Rider,"Dragon Rider tells of a young boy and an eight legged cat who rides on the back of a dragon.They are on a journey to find a new land,somewhere in the depths of the mountains.The characters will have to make it to the mountain before hunters do.They must embark on a terrifying mission that will change their lives forever.Dragon Rider is an exciting,an adventerous,and a thrilling book.It will leave you turning the pages,unwilling to stop reading.It left me sad when I was done.I was eager to read it again.As you read this book,you will soon beleive thatit's a great book too!"
5,Dragons Rock,"Dragon Rider is a great book, the characters are really good, I reallyenjoyed it greatly. -Likes To Read A LOT"
4,Dragons Rock!,"Dragon Rider was a very good book. I have the special edition at home with the fold-out map inside. If you like fantacy books like Eragon, Artaems Fowl, Chronicals of Narnia, all that good stuff, I really reccomend this book for you."
4,Good,A great fantasy book a real thrill of events. A dragon and a boy and brownie set out to find a paradise for the fellow dragons of the world. on the way they meat tons of mysterious characters life dwarfs and a wicked dragon who is also searching for the paradise. I thought the book was kind of dull at some points could have about 50-100 pages shorter. Funke did a great job of describing the characters and terraine. It was good I would recomend it for young aldults.
4,A Fun Wordwide Adventure,This book is great for family storytime nights! It is very descriptive and characters are quite unique. There is a good share of suspence and it is sure to leave you wondering about how it will all end.
4,Enchanting Adventure,"This book is a wonderful read for any age. Cornelia Funke entrances the reader with witty humor, magical phenomenon, and excellent writing. I have enjoyed this story over and over again. It is a wonderful choice for middle school ages especially."
5,Dragon Rider,"I began reading dragon rider in second grade amd i loved it. ever since i have read it twice every year all the way to ninth grade. an amazing story with lots of fantasy that pulls you into the story right away. complete with tiny humans, baskilisks, mountain gnomes, dragons, humans, brownies, and rats, this book is a great tale with a stupendous plot that follows you all the way to the rim of heaven."
5,You've Got to Love Talking Dragons,"This is one of Cornelia Funke's better books. It is easy to seperate the good guys from the bad guys and the good guys win in the end. It is a long book, but in this case that is a good thing."
2,"Slow pacing, ponderous, rude characters...","Not very entertaining. Slow-paced, stereotyped female characters, a purely-evil antagonist with no reason to exist, unevolving personalities, irrelevant plot digressions, endless nasty and pointless dialog.Frau Funke's German-to-English translator evidently missed the distinction between Elves and Fairies - quite clear in the British tradition, but lost here because the German ""Elfen"" can refer to either. She simply takes whatever magical creature she's heard of and assigns to them whatever attributes strikes her fancy.A good editor would have cut this huge volume down by 30-50%. During storytime I cut out the dross just to hasten making an end. Dreary and tiresome by the end."
3,good for the young,it was a good book enjoyable but for the younger of readers. i must say Inkheart is beautiful this is not as much so. but having read sevral of Cornelia's other books i picked up this one it is almost not by the same auther comepare to thief lord and inkheart but as said by others young readers will be most pleased.
5,One of the Best Books in the World,"It has very good literature and is very funny. From brownies that love fungi to rats in flying airplanes, this book has a lot of different species. In all, this is a very good book."
2,An odd theme in a book for children.,First I have to preface my comment with the admission that I did not finish this book all the way though. I bought it with the intention of reading it to my 4 year-old as a bedtime story. He seemed interested in dragons so I thought that this would be a good book for him. We really only got a few chapters in when I got tired of all of the human bashing that goes on. I want my child growing up learning about the ways humans make things better not how awful we are. If there is a thematic change in this book that I do not know about then I apologize. But I could not continue reading this to my son. I just thought that a counter to the glowing praises should be written for those like me who are picky about the messages that are underlying the stories our children hear.
3,Yawn...,"From reading the book Inkheart, I fell iin love with Cornelia Funke's writing. I thought I would read this one because I love fantasy creatures, especially dragons. This book was okay, but it was confusing and kind of silly. I eventually had to put it down. Depending on how old you are, I think the younger kids would like this book better. I give it a B- because it didn't hold my attention."
3,A Little Disappointed,I thought it was kind of boring compared to all her other books. I personally thought the names were kind of dorky. I thought the (fold out) map was cool. I don't think it is a very well developed plot. I thought the characters were OK. Try her other books.
2,Lame Narration -- Read It Instead!,"Note: This review applies to the audio version only.Brendan Fraser does a decent job with the character's voices, but that's about the only good thing to say about his reading of this delightful story. The narrative parts are spoken in a near whisper while the conversations are given at normal volume, which makes it hard to adjust the speaker volume. Words are unreliably enunciated, phrases are often broken at odd places, the wrong words get emphasized, and the narrator speeds up and slows down unpredictably. All in all, an annoying reading. Get the print edition!"
2,Good book/Bad Narrator,Don't waste your money on the audio version of this book. It has nearly ruined the story for me. Frasier almost whispers much of the text and then yells the dialogue. I was constantly playing with the volume while I listened. A few of the character voices were decent but Frasier's Scottish accent is just cruel.
1,Quality of book incorrect,Very excited to receive this book. My daughter loves it. The listing stated that it is Used - Very good. That is incorrect. The binding on the book was all but falling apart. There were just a few of the binding threads holding the pages in. Also there is darkly hi-lighted pages with writing making it nearly impossible to read. Very unhappy with this purchase.
4,11 year old son is really enjoying this book,"My son does not like to read. Never has and probably never will. It takes an engaging story to keep him from complaiing about having to do his nightly 20 minutes of reading. He has not complained once since picking up this book. Don't get me wrong. He would not read this or any other book unless told he had to do so. But, he is really enjoying this book as he not only is reading it without complaint, he eagerly fills me in on what he has just read when he finishes his nightly reading time.Thus, I highly recommend this book for student who enjoy fantasy adventure stories."
5,Well... What should I say?...IT ROCKS!!!,"Do like mystery? Do like magical creatures, and books were you couldn't stop reading? Well you have found the right book.Dragon Rider, written by Cornelia Funke, is a fun book for all ages to read.Can a boy, a rat, and dragon save magical creatures? You find out in this great book. And are the best friends really helping or is their ""help"" working against them?Cornelia Funke is a great author for children's books. She has even written this book ""Inkheart"". She has a wild imagination that pulls you in a different worldH.M."
4,One of my Favs,"Dragon Rider by Cornelia Funke is one of the best books I've read this month, it tells the story of an orphaned boy that meets a team made up of a dragon and brownie, together they try and find a place called the rim of heaven, because the valley of dragons will soon be flooded. While doing this they meet a Homunculus which is a spy of the fearsome beast Nettlebrand who follows them steathly to the Rim of Heaven to attack and eventually eat all silver dragons. The homunculus(Twigleg) soon confesses his espionage but they forgive him and in so doing he becomes a mole.Giving false info to Nettlebrand and really working for the good guys.The book was long (about 530 pgs) but definately worth the reading, she has a creative style of writing and the abiltity to portray fantasic creatures like never before."
4,Classic Fantasy.,"This book, first of all, is great.The whole idea of the novel is well-done, with no big troubles with prose and such.However, there is one small, almost nitpicky thing that nags me every single time I read, and also what prevented this from getting a full five stars. It is the fact that the main point of the story, the dragon (although some may argue on that point) is more like a tranportatiion device than a character. Most of the story's plot is based on Firedrake and his quest for the Rim of Heaven, but most of the conversation is taking place between other characters."
5,LOVED IT!,"DRAGON RIDER is the best fantasy I have ever read! It is exciting, and makes you wish for a sequel. I think it is Funke's best novel."
3,Aguirre100@aol.com,"Proffessor of NT theology at Princeton, Donald Juel gives us a basic introduction to the Markan gospel and its issues. His style is clear and verbose. And it is a real shame that the work is so small and not a verse by verse commentary. The format is topical and the tone is popular.I found myself in agreement with most of his conclusions. You might be better off purchasing this work in the used section.Rick E Aguirre.Reader in New Testament Studies Southern California."
3,Nice sign to put on a young Yankee fan's bedroom door,"This was a hit! We have a young, enthusiastic Yankee fan living among us Chicago Cubs and White Sox fans. His room is already destined to be condemned for dirty clothes in the closet, under the bed, over furniture, etc, so putting up the Yankee sign along with his ""STAY OUT"" poster made sense. It's nicely made, heavyweight and the colors are great."
4,Great gift,This was the perfect gift for my grandson (die hard Yankees fan). He is displaying proudly on his bedroom door. Nice price too!!!
4,Why marriage?,"A great little book on the biblical foundation of marriage and why God is so concerned about it. Not an institution to be entered into lightly, marriage is not only a picture of God's unfailing love, but it is a life-long commitment of the highest and most sacred degree.I recommend this book for couples who are engaged, married, struggling or considering divorce. Also a must for pastors, lay leaders and biblical counselors. Great study for singles groups, couples and newlyweds."
4,Beautiful,Very nice necklace but little expensive and delicate! But its is very good condition after nearly 2 years of purchase.
5,A sociologist looks at homeschooling and sees the future,"Meighan does not waste a lot of words about whether or why homeschooling is good - he presents research data that shows homeshcoolers do better both academically and socially. He then moves on to examine how come all these parents, with no degrees in education and no government guidance, can do better than schools. He suggests that in order to improve, schools should adopt the same methods that homeschoolers use."
3,"Cute pictures, some good ideas, shaky theological foundation","This book has a good idea: that God loves us at least as the person who loves us most.However, looking at the second part of the book (Q&A;), I'm a bit concerned when I see things like the following:- The authors justify their ideas based on the work of controversial theologians (Rahner and Barth).- They seem to not believe in traditional Catholic ideas such as mortal sin and hell.Just my two cents."
1,"""Damnable Heresy""","Humanistic, feel-good cartoon book that could be part of the Oprah Winfrey show very easily. (May have been, in fact.)Rejects the Gospel, god's justice, and the concept of sin in favor of ""outgrowing"" former religion.First-century heresy, molded to tickle the ears of 20th-century sinners. Guilt-driven legalists will love it; brings God down to the level of a compromised Western catholic in a religious coma."
4,What is your image of God?,"My first thought was that this was a children's book, however upon reading it, I discovered that it was indeed an adult's book with a message for the child we once were. It addresses the subconscious beliefs we carry around about who God is. If your feelings toward God are filled with ambiguity; if your relationship with God could be described as a love/hate or love/fear relationship; if the phrase ""fear of the Lord"" fills you with a sense of dread, then you will definitely want to read this book. If you're like me, your image of God will be transformed"
5,All Season Candies,"Really nice collection of candy recipes. Ideas and suggestions for different candies to make all year long; Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn. Then there's also a section for Children's candies along with recommendations for making larger batches. Well written with clear guidelines."
3,A Brief Candy Primer,"This is a rather slender and brief book. However, the recipes are well chosen and reasonably correct. It is a decent, but not great candy book.My main objection to this book is that it is not suitable for beginners. There is no information on techinque, ingredients, or tools. Those who already know their way around the kitchen should have no trouble with the recipes. Also, some of the recipes are a little short on needed instructions, viz melting fondant, tempering chocolate, and pralines.On the other hand, it has most of the basic candy types you will want to do: fondant, marzipan, truffles, nougat, fudge, praline, jelly, brittles, dried fruits, caramel, taffy."
3,"Not the greatest ""Apostles""","I wish I could be as enthusiastic as Roger Oakley about this recording, since I too have been wishing for a modern recording of this work. The performance is pretty good, but not on the level of Boult. The soloists are fine, especially Anna Leese, although I miss Clifford Grant's menacing bass in the Judas role. And the sound is strangely restricted and edgy, like a bad A/D transfer. Plus the organ is largely inaudible. I'm afraid this won't be my new favorite Apostles."
1,Sweet & Low pancake mix,"this was not my favorite, kinda tough and size is very small. I would like to have known the size."
1,BETTER THAN THIS,"THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO TRACE THE HISTORY OF THE GOTHIC TRIBES FROM THEIR ORIGINS TO THE TIME OF THEIR DESTRUCTION. THE BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I HAD THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. IT GAVE LITTLE OR NO INFORMATION ON THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF GOTHIC LIFE: LINGUISTICS, WEAPONS, WARFARE, RELIGION AND THEIR CULTURE IN GENERAL. IT SEEMED MORE INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING THE AUTHORS ANTHROPOLOGICAL VIEW ON THIS PEOPLE THAN ACTUALLY DESCRIBING THEM. THE NARRATIVE VIEWS ON SEVERAL BATTLES WERE SHORT AND BLANDLY WRITTEN. THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER BOOK ON THE SUBJECT THAN THIS. CHECK OUT HERWIG WOLFRAM FOR A BETTER HISTORY THAN THIS ONE"
4,"Past their prime, but still good stuff.","It's from the post-John Williams days, with Kevin Peek, Herbie Flowers, Steve Gray, Tristan Fry, and Paul Hart (Violin, Keys, Mandolin), so is past the group's peak, and is the 51 minute edit, rather than the full show, sadly, but it's good stuff nevertheless. It just could've been better.[...](I await the Westminster Abbey show!)"
4,The Ballplayers,"This is a great book for anyone interested in baseball history. Whereas the Baseball Encyclopedia can become overwhelming with nothing but statistics, this book shines. With a story for each individual player, you learn who they were, not just what they hit in 1967. Whether for casual reading or baseball research this is a must for baseball fans."
3,Snuffy,Should have read the dimensions more carefully. It was a disappointment on how small it was. Purchased Big Bird with this.
3,Snuffy,Soft stuffed replica of video and TV Sesame character. 16 month old grandson relates this toy with video and is learning the association when the character appears. Although he is not talkiing yet he is attempting to say the name.
2,Smaller than you think,"I was a bit suprized when i opened the package and saw how small the stuffed Animal was. I'm thinkg 17"" plush toy is going to be a good size... Nope its not as big as you would think."
3,Snuffy?,"My 2 year old daughter loves Sesame Street. I thought this was a good representation of Snuffy, however it looks more like an elephant. Wrong color, no long lazy elashes & he's not very shaggy. I, at the time, wasn't able to find any good Snuffy dolls though."
4,Snuffleupagus Review,"I got this for my fiance's baby cousin, and I was generally happy with it except for the shedding. It doesn't shed too bad, but some of the hairs do come off."
4,"Sesame Street Snuffleupagus 12"" Plush Doll","The Sesame Street Snuffleupagus 12"" Plush Doll was a nice addition to my Niece's Sesame Street collection of character dolls. Very durable and cute! Makes a great gift."

2,Missing Units,"I have had a tracfone for a few years. I have not had problems with reception or making calls. The customer service is a nightmare. You really can not transfer your phone number. I tried from one tracfone to another. What a mess and hours talking to people who barely speak English. Last time I purchased minutes I got 800. I used 400 in about 4-5 months. I rarely use my phone which is why I have a tracfone. The surprise came in the last two weeks when suddenly 350 minutes of my last 400 were gone. I did not increase my time on the phone. What happened to the minutes??? My father in law has had the same problems. He never uses his phone, but his minutes have disappeared. With this recent issue I would suggest looking for some other plan. I am not sure it will save me any money."

4,"heavy, sturdy, strong sound","The pitch is lower than others, which I enjoy (others sound a little high and lack the richness of a heavier or thicker metal). They are a bit heavy, though that's not been a problem for me. Also, the elastic comes stapled, so you have to adjust them; you should do this anyhow, since everyone has slightly different sized fingers. While these are not ornate like others, they work well. One problem: Because there is only one hole, they tend to move out of place while dancing, which means you have to stop and fix them, or keep playing them the wrong way. I have had to tighten mine way too much to try and stop this problem, which is not ideal if you like your figners to look...less blue... Timely shipping, good product."
3,"Very heavy, but has a nice sound","These are too heavy for me, and the elastic fingers need to be made smaller... they are different sizes, but mostly fit only my thumbs. They do have a very nice sound, but not sure how I could make it through a performance with how heavy they are. Guess it depends on your personal style as to whether they will suit your needs. I have never had a set before, and bought them for a class. I ended up buying a lighter-weight, more-expensive set after receiving these."
5,My Biased Opinion,"I purchased this project when it was originally released around 1982 & was blown away by it.And this was the CASSETTE version!Since I gave away the worn-out tape,I have been looking for the CD version for the last 10 ten years.This one is a no-brainer gimme.Get it while it's back & the follow up album(I'm Walkin)before they disappear"
5,Super cool....I'm a big fan.,"I'm A smooth jazz lover and this has to be some of the smoothest, sexiest, music I've ever heard. The arrangements are enjoyable to listen to. Also there are some fun tunes as well that keep your feet tapping. I saw this young man on CBS' The Early Show featuring Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson. He actually wrote the theme music to the show and Gumbel was admiring his work and promoting this cd ""Chris Bowman, First Love"". I would suggest this product to anyone who loves good smooth jazz. It's a must for your collection. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"nice music, bad sound","i liked the movie a lot, and i like the songs in this cd, but i think the sound quality is really poor.the instrumental songs are ok, but the ones with voice not so. the balance betwen instruments and voice is not very good."
3,Adequately entertaining tale,"""Double Vision"" reads somewhat like a cross between mystery/romance/science fiction story. The characters Keryn, Rachel, and Dillon are pretty well developed. The dialogue is okay. The pace is okay. The plot is marginal.The plot basically is about a high tech company whose employees are developing a ""super computer"" which can do decryption and encryption. They make a breakthrough, and what are the consequences to that? The antagonist/s are not well developed, nor well explained, and the ending of the book was a disappointment for me.Not nearly as good as ""Oxygen"" but ""Double Vision"" is an adequately entertaining read."
1,Very Disappointed,"I'm not sure who wrote this book. I have read Mr. Ingermanson's others books (Oxygen, The Fifth Man, and the time-travel series) and those were good books, tightly written and with some good character depth.This book, on the other hand, is very frivolous, shallow and silly. Maybe there was so much potential that it needed a more thorough treatment in an expanded series but, as another reviewer noted, it's all wrapped up in a nice neat package (with a thousand loose ends that don't seem thought through) so I'm glad to note we won't be seeing this band of goofballs in print again.I'll check out more novels by this author if he continues to write, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. :("
4,"Great Product, PlaysForSure functionality not there","I bought this product after doing alot of research, and have been very pleased with the performance. It actually works as a Napster to Go compatible product, so transfer of playlists, etc is very easy. I've found that the easiest way to copy movies is to use my DVD player, and that works well. I've got about 100 songs, 250 photos (at 5mp resolution), and 7 full-length movies and still have 70GB of memory available. Battery life has been okay, the included earphones need improvement, it's a good idea to buy the extra power/charging cord for travel. I travel to Hong Kong regularly, and the movies on the airlines are unsatisfactory, so I'm looking forward to enjoying this on my 14 hour flight!!"
1,Frustrated and disappointed,Just returned my second AV500. First one would not charge / turn on. Technical support told me to exchange it.Second AV500 seemed to work but had to use TV pod to get A/V in (awkward). Then after recording a video file I was not able to transfer it to my computer. Small files will transfer but not the larger one. Technical support was not able to explain the error message shown. Tested on multiple computers.... lost important video footage. Gave up.
3,Works good but the battery exploded,"I really enjoyed this product but one morning it wasn't working and I noticed the battery had puffed out about 20% and the back could not close. I had it for about one year when this happened. The other problem is some formats are not compatible so you have to convert them, which is a real pain in the B."
3,Get a Pocket Dish! For the inner geek in you!,"This is very feature rich product but also very buggy. It is not as easy as an iPod to use, but I still like it better. If you use Dish Network, then I would recommend going for a pocket-dish version of Archos AV500 (30GB). Check it out at pocketdish.com. You can easily move the programs from the DVR to device. I prefer this because it gives easy access to good quality content. I have to re-start my Dish Network before connecting my device; I found that to be a pain."
5,Soul Mates,"This was a captivating story. The love story between Damion and Attica was tender and passionate. It was refreshing to read a romance novel where the basis of the story was not revolving around sex. I believe the book was so much more enjoyable because you were thoroughly involved in the story line. Candace Proctor wrote a beautiful story that allowed me to feel the joys and sorrows of this tale. I have read ""Night in Eden"" also by Candace Proctor but must say ""The Last Knight"" was by far a better read. This love story is one of the reasons I enjoy reading historical romances. If you have not read this book I strongly recommend it. I don't think you'll be sorry."
3,Cute.,"Bo Vine, <strong>How to Be a Cow</strong> (Price Stern Sloan, 2002)Quick, funny board book by ""Bo Vine"" (actually, Shelly Meredith of <em>Whose Nose is This?</em>/<em>Whose Tail is This?</em> fame) that covers some of the basics of cowdom, though there's more than enough anthropomorphism mixed in that you don't want to use this as baby's first primer on cattle husbandry. The illustrations are too cure for words, and as long as Meredith's brand of broad humor works for you, this is one you won't mind reading to the kiddies the first hundred or so times. ***"
5,Mooooooo!,"My son (now age 11 mo.) LOVES this book. It is, by far, his favorite book and he wants to hear it over and over and over...I've actually got it memorized. The pictures are bright and colorful and the rhyming is sweet. All children will love learning about how to be a cow."
5,Truth is more shocking than fiction,"I received this book as a gift yesterday and stayed up all night reading it and finished it. Luckily, I did not have any nightmares about animals being treated in the way in which Sue Coe describes and paints in this revealing book. I recommend this book to the world; everyone should be aware of the way we treat animals, from pumping them with chemicals and slaughtering them with a knife as they hang from a back foot, to eating them on our dinner tables. The people of the world need to have this information so that they can consciously make a decision about how they can change their contibution regarding these crimes which occur on a daily, hourly, minute by minute basis in every part of the world."
5,Wonderful and educational! Excellent book!,This book converted me to veganism.Sue Coe has a way of descibing everything that she sees and you almost feel like you are right there. This book is a definte must for anyone that is wondering about the hidden side to meat.Coe tells us about the things you would never think would happen but these things happen. They do...everyday and it is so sad.The meat industry is exactly like a Holocaust. Sue Coe just helps us to realize that.
4,Stupendous!,"I must admit, this is an incredible composition,BUT, though certain tracks are INCREDIBLY MINDBOGGLINLY great, others are mediocre and sound like a soundtrack. Don't het me wrong, those certain tracks are definatey worth the pice of the album but don't expect to not hit the 'skip' button when listening."
2,If you'll wear it once then by it!,I liked it when I first bought it and wore it but after I washed it once all the elastic started shredding from it...couldnt wear it again. For look and feel I gave it 4 stars but for usage I give it none.
3,Good,"The product is really cute. The shipping is a little ridiculous. It cost me $8 to ship something that weighed maybe 1lb, and took almost 2 weeks to get to me."
4,Great starter gate for puppy,"I purchased this gate to keep my new yorkie puppy out of certain areas of the house. It is easy to set up; after several clumsy tries. This gate works well for small dogs or puppies It may not keep a medium or bigger sized dog from jumping over, as the gate only reaches about knee level (on a human). Other than that the gate is great for the value. The gate looks nice, although the wood is kind of flimsy. It your dog likes to chew, this item may not be the best product. The swing out door is a nice touch, although it took my puppy several tries to figure out he can actually walk thru the gate door when its open."
4,"Nice looking, nice height, easy to use!","This is a great gate for a small puppy or dog. Pressure mounts are easy to use and don't damage walls. Length is easily adjustable, even for fairly wide doorways. It's short enough to step over and for our cats to jump over, but keeps puppy contained. Also, price is reasonable for a well-made wooden gate."
2,could be much better,Gate is a great height for small dogs and is easy for children to safely step over. Design could be greatly improved if the four rubber side feet were adjustable with a screw like many gates on the market. The rubber feet just slide in so as to not allow for the best and tightest fit to the walls. Good enough for a temporary solution. We used felt chair pads to make up the extra space between the side feet and the wall.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I should have remembered the old adage you get what you pay for. I admittedly was looking for an inexpensive gate and this one seemed like a bargain.The bumpers are supposed to be adjustable but they do not actually screw into the unit. They just sit in the holes so they are NOT adjustable.I finally got the item to fit into my stairwell opening (the adjustable size claim is not 100% accurate. Your space must be a size to fit one of the sets of predrilled holes the knobs fit into) and after opening and shutting the door twice to make sure it swung over the carpet, it SNAPPED RIGHT OFF! Perhaps I merely received a defective one but I can assure you that I am taking it back to my local PetCo today.Save yourself the aggravation and spend a little more to get a better product.It did arrive very quickly and was in one piece."
2,Lasted for a week,Too low that even my 10 week shih tzu was able to jump over it. The construction is good. This size is sturdier than the wider version.
2,Great idea but broken,This product is the right size and the door in it is a great option. This is easy enough to step over but hard enough for our dogs that they haven't tried. The only problem with it is that it showed up broken from the box on the door support so I had to glue it back together which was going to be cheaper then paying for shipping back and then waiting for the new one while my puppy urinates all over the house.
1,Terrible!!!! Do Not Buy!!,"Do not buy. This Gate is awful! Zero Stars! It did not come as pictured. The pressure fit knobs shown in the photo are instead flat plastic (which is useless) and the 'nuts' that would presumably keep the knobs in place are enormous. The problem? Once assembled, the doggie door does not close and the gate does not pressure fit in doorway. Completely useless."
2,Ok for what I needed,"The gate was purchased to keep a small dog in a laundry room to prevent accidents while potty training the dog. Worked well for that purpose except the side knobs are not very well constructed as the screws seem to strip in all four places, not allowing for a tight fit int he doorway. So we added shims to hold the gate tight enough that the dog can't know it over. If you can deal with it wearing out very very fast and not working right for the fit, get it. The gate itself is ok, it's the side knobs that don't work properly"
2,Gate lasted 2 weeks,"Let me start by saying that we have an extremely stubborn miniature Dachsund. Within a couple of days of receiving the gate, Rusty had chewed through the wood, making the gate ineffective. We added a screen to it, which fixed that problem, but soon enough he had figured out how to jump over the gate. He's a small dog, but the gate wasn't quite tall enough to prevent him jumping over it. We raised it, but it still was short enough for him to maneuver over at the right angle.This gate might work well for a well behaved small dog, but isn't quite tall/durable enough for a stubborn dog like ours."
4,Needs more instructions,"I received this gate a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of the puppy I was getting for Christmas. I finally took it out of the box to inspect before the puppy arrived and there are holes for the bumpers but I couldn't figure out how to tighten it to the door frame. Finally, after looking at it and at the pictures I realized that you have to tighten the bumpers by turning them. this means that the gate is more or less a permanent fixture. you can't quickly remove it. You can open the gate to let the pets roam free but if you want to remove the gate, you have to release the bumpers. I will see well this works when the puppy arrives. I was only hoping to use this for a few months untill I housebroke the puppy. Then he can have full rein of the house. If company arrives and I want to keep him in the kitchen, it will take some time to secure the gate to the door frame, so I may not use it."
4,Keeps the pups out,"It's tall enough to keep my Dachshunds out of the carpeted areas, while letting the cats have the run of the house. It's also short enough for me (I'm 5'2) to step easily over. I didn't have the difficulty some other reviewers had during the assembly process.I do wish it was available in different finishes; a cherry would've complemented my floors and furniture perfectly."
1,Poor quality don't waste your money,This is a terrible gate my 4 month old yorkie can climb over it and the gate broke after just one month
1,flimsy,Gate weak and falls apart with minimal use. very weak construction. my dog loved it though...he found he could get right through it
4,Easy to Use. Very good for Small Dogs,"The four pressure knob/bumper (or whatever you call it) have independent adjustment, that makes this gate easy to use and install. The height of the gate is enough for our mini doxie; you could also raise the gate a little bit (enough not to let your dog go under the gate) to get some height. however, i think if you utilize the max width of 44"" the gate would be a little flimsy; but for the price it's very good and just what we needed.The height of the gate and the no-drill easy-to-install feature i think are the selling point for me."
3,Nice affordable gate,"This is a nice affordable gate however, I've only had it a month now and I can't get it to stay up. It's a perfect size for my puppy."
4,Four Paws Walk Over pet gate,Four Paws Walk Over Wooden Gate for Small PetsThe pet gate is perfect for us. We have a small pom and it keeps her in the kitchen while it is easy for us to step over. I'm going to buy 2 more for other rooms in the house.
3,"Walk over wood gate - 30""-44""X18""","This would be a great little gate if it would fit tightly in my doorway. I am not sure if the little rubber screw knobs are defective or the holes in which they screw into are defective. They do not tighten up against the door jam enough for the gate to stay firmly in place. It is loose and gets knocked over. I have not contacted the seller about it however. Luckily, I have a little ""chicken"" dog who hasn't dared to jump up on it and knock it over. But sometimes people walking over don't lift their foot high enough and it falls down. Otherwise, it would be absolutely perfect for a small house dog to be contained in a room."
1,Horrible,"So far, this is the only unsatisfactory purchase I've had from Amazon. This is the crappiest thing I've bought here. It is beyond flimsy. The screws are too small to actually hold the gate in place and all the wood pieces are falling out of their respective holes. I might as well have thrown 30 bucks out the window. Seriously, this is junk. They had to try hard to produce something This bad."
1,Not as described...,"I purchased this item, but when I went to install it, the pieces shown in the instructions and in the pictures were not the same as the pieces included in the box. I tried to make them work, but it was impossible. I returned it thinking that it must have been a mistake, but the second gate I received had the same issue."
1,WRONG HARDWARE (Twice!),"I gate itself is great (good height, sturdy), but it came with the wrong hardware making the gate completely unusable. I called the company and received absolutely no help. They acted as if they didn't understand how that could happen. THEN I read other reviews with the same complaint about the wrong hardware, so I know the company had to have been aware of the problem. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and asked Amazon to send a replacement. I just received the new gate today and, what do ya know, the exact same WRONG hardware. Will be returning for a refund."
3,"Nice concept, but issues",I was looking for a lower gate that could expand to keep my small dogs contained in an area in my new home. I liked the height of this gate and the fact that it was wooden and seemed sturdy. The issue is with how it tightens against the wall. It has four knobs that screw out from the sides so you can adjust it for the space. One of the knobs seems to have a stripped inside and does not tighten. I'm frustrated that I probably will need to return this product.
2,Poorly constructed,"I read other reviews, so maybe I was just unlucky. This appeared to be just what I needed to keep one small dog out and allow our 2 cats in. When I opened it, parts fell off of the gate itself. When I tried to put them back on, they didn't fit well. This caused the gate to be uneven, and it wouldn't fit securely in the doorway on one side. I am disappointed, it wasn't worth the cost of the item and shipping."
2,Would not recommend this,This gate did not work! I would adjust one side then I would do the other and the opposite side would loosen. Very frustrating
2,Not great,The mechanics of this gate were fine but the quality of the wood needs some improvement. The wood is extremely soft which allowed my 10lb dachshund to pull it down and eventually eat through it. I had to make repairs and modifications in less than a week of use. I ended up having to replace it in a little over a month.
5,walk over pet gate,This was our second purchase of the small step over gate ... like it because it is easy to install and not too high to step over carrying something and even has a small door to open for pets to go through.Thanks
2,Not very sturdy,"I got this for my mini dachshund puppy and for my very narrow doorway. It looked awesome and worked good at first but I had to keep tightening the bolts and now it's been tightened so much it won't stay up. The doorway is awesome and closes good but it didn't always close tight because its only a handle with a spring that you pull. Sometimes the hole didnt line up exactly and I'd think it was closed but it wasn't. The height was perfect until she learned to climb over it! But when I got it, it was already broken and didnt feel like spending money to return it so I just used gorilla glue which worked but I had to keep re applying every week...Overall I'd say I liked the gate but wish it was better quality!"
5,Wonderful for wee doggies!,"I just bought this today and I am so pleased! The installation was about 2 minutes, including the 'help' of my 3 year old son. Immediately, both dogs walked through the little door without hesitation. It is very secure in the doorway.It is a small doorway so the entire little door opening isn't visible, but still enough room for my chi and chi-mixes to walk through. Noticing that one is already eyeing the height, I know that I can put it another 2-3 inches higher without ricking the dogs going under, giving it more like 21 inches in height.Love this, recommend it."
5,Perfect fit for smal dogs,I Wasn't sure if this would be tall enough for my Yorkshire Terrier. We were tired of always hopping over the normal size dog gates. This gate is perfect height for small dogs and is easy for adults and kids to walk over. The small door is great for your dog to go through while leaving it up for convience! I plan on purchasing another one for a different room!
5,Four Paws Walk Over Wooden Gate for Small Pets,I couldn't be happier with the gate! It was easy to install and it performs its job.
4,Works fine for the price,"I bought three of these to use as barriers. I have a beagle and llasa apso that like to get into the litter box and will eat anything. Out of the box, I thought I would have to return them but after installation they didn't seem to be quite as flimsy as I feared. They have held up well despite my knocking into them many times before getting used to them. Overall, they are a good alternative to the more expensive versions.My cats are able to jump over the barriers without any problem which was what I wanted.The little doors are cute, but I don't really use them."
1,No credibility,"This book is not very Catholic. Every child receives the Sacrament of Confession before receiving Eucharist in our Archdiocese. The most disappointing error is the Our Father. They printed the Protestant version, which includes the doxology. Catholics don't say that.What a shame the title of the book doesn't match the content."
1,Awful!,"Full of mistakes! Try ""Catholicism for Dummies"" instead, or read the Catechism! As a reviewer below pointed out, it doesn't even have the imprimatur, and no wonder."
3,Woodshop Dust Control,"Woodshop Dust Control is an OK reference.It is dated as far as information on design is concerned.As the only was to deal with dust, in My opinion is start at the source, collector selection and ductwork design should have had more of an emphasis.Specific designs for collection at tools without existing dust collection ports or as is more often the case poorly designed ports would have been helpfull.If construction of an central collector is in your future talk to Oneida and Air Handeling Systems. If you've never seen a shop vac before this book is a good starting point."
3,OK,"The first book was pretty good, but I got really tired of reading the little quotes from bartimaeus on every page...."
5,Great sound- adds to any Christmas program!,I've been using these bells all season andhave enjoyed them. It seems to be sensitiveto different style needs and definitely puts outthe volume!
3,"Its pretty good, but not perfect","I wanted this instrument for a Christmas party to use while singing carols. It is hard to use and doesn't sound quite right. It continues to make a low ""jingly"" sound for about 10 seconds after you stop moving it so it is not a clean sound. Heavy and good quality though."
4,not bad at all,"This garment was actually pretty good for off the rack!The small pieces of leather in the front where it laces are a little uncomforable, the material is harder. Unlined, but otherwise luscious, soft, supple, form fitting leather!"
5,The Best Laptop Mouse I used,"I have used several kinds of mice, some kinds of Microsoft and some kinds of IBM, but this one, Logitech VX revolution, is the best one I like. It's light, smart, portable and have a long lift time of A AA battery."
3,Underwhelmed,"I have a history of being hard on mice. I click a LOT and forcefully, because most mice only last for a year or so for me. This one only lasted about 6 months. If you're a light clicker, maybe it'll be fine, but I was disappointed."
5,AWSOME!!! BEAUTIFULL!!,"this is not only an eyecandy , is the best mouse of the world, you can feel the good speed in any surface, the only thing i dont like is the mini reciver.. its so small and looks so fragile.. im sacred that it can brake easly..."
2,Not for a Mac,This is a great mouse for a PC. The ergonomics are the best I have ever experienced and the precision is very impressive. The Mac drivers do not enable horizontal scrolling. That functionality only works on a PC. Logitech's claim of being Mac compatible is very misleading.
5,Small and ergonomic at the same time,"Great mouse...very portable and fits well in your palm. Battery life is great too, but if you aren't using it make sure to remove the single battery for improved battery life. Highly recommended"
4,Logitech mouse,Logitech makes a very good product. This has great features altho I have trouble accidently pressing the rightclick pad occationaly. Possibly the switch might be made a little stronger? Anyway I would still buy it again. Good product.
5,Logitech VX usage for 4 weeks!,First of all I am now convinced what you pay for in a mouse is what you get. I previously owned $30 MS mouses and they have all since died. This laptop mouse is fabulous! I don't think i can ever go back to a non-spinning scroll again. In my job i get loads of emails and being able to quickly scan them has allowed me to be more efficient. So far the VX has been solid performer. The battery strength meter is great. Cross my fingers this thing will last a few years!
4,A great stuff,"The cordless mouse is very convenient for me, and the performance is good. I do recommend that."
4,great mouse,"I am happy with this wireless mouse. It is my second wireless mouse. First was a generic brand product, and I had a lot of trouble, and switched to a wired one. The logitech VX was recommended by my friends. It turned to be a good buy. It is very smooth to use. The forward and backward function keys are very useful. The usb receiver can be put into the mouse and automatically shuts off mouse. It is also convenient for carry.Cons: sometimes, it is too sensitive on rolling up and down. I don't know how to use zoom function as well as microgear at the back. i wish the company can give a more detailed manu."
5,Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks,This is my third notebook mouse and by the best. Everything about it works great.
4,Excellent Notebook Companion,"The saying ""The best comes in a small package"" best describes this product. It's a light and compact mouse packs with more features than most of the full-size mice. The ""Search"" button is proven to be very useful for someone like me who constantly do research on the Internet. The ""tilting"" feature of the scroll wheel scrolls wide pages horizontally, which helps me a lot working on a 12"" notebook screen when I am traveling. I also like the ""clip-in"" wireless USB adapter. The battery life is excellent. It is also a good-looking mouse.A couple of issues I experienced:1. The scroll wheel works in different speeds in different applications. It does not scroll fast enough in Internet Explorer but too fast in OneNote.2. The ""Forward"" and ""Back"" buttons work in Internet Explorer but not other applications like those Microsoft mice do. So far I haven't found a way to program the mouse within the software came with it."
1,Works on virtually any surface!,".... Except a mouse pad. I use my notebook as a primary computer, and being a large handed guy I wanted a larger notebook mouse. Ergonomically this mouse is absolutely phenomenal, I can use it for hours. Ive never written a review on something but Logitech support is literally non-existent if you contact them. No one answers their emails from support. This isnt a one sided banter either. Look on the internet or through reviews, logitech support doesnt answer emails plain and simple.But to my original point. The mouse is jumpy. I dont know if its the wireless reception, or my wooden desk that Im using it on, but its VERY noticeable. I thought it might be the desk, so I bought a mouse pad, it actually got WORSE! After trying out a second mouse pad with a different material I got the same terrible results. As a graphics student I say STEER CLEAR OF THIS MOUSE if you want precision, because all your going to get is an over-priced over-hyped headache."
1,Poor construction overshadows good design,"This mouse comes with great software. Highly customizable for your programs.The radio reception is great even across the room.However, the mouse buttons are poorly designed. It makes the mouse so frustrating to use I would caution anyone against buying it."
4,Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse,Love this mouse. Functions well and smooth movement. USB receiver hides in the mouse when not in use which also turns off/on the mouse automatically. Great feature.-1 star because the buttons (left/right click) are somewhat (minor) stiff to click.
3,Not what I thought,"This mouse is too small for someone with big hands. I don't like the scroll wheel--ratcheted position is too slow, free-wheeling position is too fast plus, often, it didn't respond at all to the wheel."
4,Its Pretty Good,I have used this mouse for 3 years and also used it as my gaming mouse. It has handled up pretty well. Recently I bought another one because the left mouse button started doing double clicks on its own. I liked enough to buy another. At first it feels pretty small but you eventually get used to it and find the thumb position and the feel of the mouse is pretty nice. Didn't feel trying to like another when I have this one that has been great over the years. It has a little compartment to store the USB receiver to help with portability.
4,GREAT Mouse for Inventor,"I'm a Autodesk Inventor user and was looking for a wireless mouse with programable functions. After some simple programming of the mouse's buttons I now have common functions set on the mouse (ESC, F4, etc).The wheel is great although I do change the setting (under the mouse) back and forth depending on the application I'm using.I highly recommend it. Next purchase is a 3D Connexion Navigator!!"
1,"Brough it back, not for CAD",Everything is nice with mouse except of the force that you need to apply to press a middle button (the wheel). With CAD (Pro/Engineer) you work with MMB most of the time. Logitech's mouse is not designed to allow frequent work with middle button. Too bad.
3,Loved it for the 1st 6 months.. Then the receiver stopped working,"I used this mouse almost every day for about 6 months, then the USB receiver started to fizzle out on me. At first, it would be kind of temperamental and I would just have to wiggle it a little bit. But now, I have to plug the receiver in and then pull it out about 1/8th of an inch to get it to work. And it's getting worse as time goes on.Aside from that, the mouse is great. Very responsive and fits great in a laptop bag and fits my hand well. If the receiver problem never occurred, I would easily give this mouse 5 stars."
4,Best mouse I've used.,"It's simply a full function mouse that fits very ergonomically in my hand. The dongle is small, not the smallest made, but stores nicely in the mouse which also turns the mouse on and off. The two speed mouse wheel isn't that important to me since I work on a small laptop screen, but the free spin option could be used for long scrolling documents. The zoom in, zoom out, and search button are nice offers. The software that comes with it will allow you to change the scrolling speed for each application. It's awesome. I don't give it 5 stars cause I don't ever give things full score. Buy one and like it."
4,"Scroll-wheel too light, middle-button too hard, perfect otherwise","Perfect except(i) that scroll-wheel is too light - the wheel has almost no friction and will happily roll on past intuitive stopping point, so, one has to conciously control it, becoming annoying and ardous after hours of heavy use.(ii) The middle button, underneath the wheel requires significant pressure, so much that one cannot help but unwittingly move the wheel before the press is registered but now in the wrong position.Otherwise, very precise and sensitive. I can move the cursor (mouse pointer) around the screen with slight finger movement, allowing the wrist to stay almost stationary."
2,Connectivity Freezes Up,"I got this for Christmas, works great, has a real nice smooth and precise feel to it. About using it for 1.5 weeks the connectivity would get lost. I would move the mouse and click and nothing would happen for about 10 secs then it would start working again. Over time this got more and more frequent. I thought maybe the USB receiver was too far away (on the back of my notebook) so I moved it to the USB port on the right side, 1 or 2 inches away from the mouse. Still, same problem. So then I thought maybe the battery was low, I had the Duracell that came with it in there. So I put in a newly charged battery, still same problem. It freezes up more and more frequently now, it's very annoying. I'm going to contact customer support on this one."
3,"do NOT use this mouse for FPS games, otherwise Excellent mouse!","this mouse is an excellent mouse for general use ie. web browsing, chatting, everyday programs on the desktop. But once you go into a game ie. CS, is where it goes downhill. If you use a low sensitivity, like me, moving the mouse side to side quickly will cause the mouse to skip frames, and the mouse wont full move in the direction you want it to. It will lag, and be jaggy and not fully go through the motion you put it through. It is virtually impossible to move from one enemy to another across the screen in a natural smooth flowing motion, and it usually ends up with me getting killed. So if you want to use a mouse for CS, pick up a cheap mx510 or 518 (you can find them for really cheap now), this mouse is good for the laptop user who doesn't play FPS games too much. Besides the FPS gaming bit, this mouse is excellent for everyday uses."
1,THEY SENT A USED ONE!!!!!,What I received was USED!!! The retail packaging was in awful shape and was CLEARLY opened by someone else previously and then returned.
2,It Works,"It works fine but I continue to have problems adjusting the speed of the mouse to meet my desires. Quite frankly, I hate this item."
3,problem in KDE,"This mouse is of good ergonomics, feeling comfortable to be used as a desktop mouse. However, there's some serious issue when used with KDE/Fedora. I did some cross testing. Other mice do not show the symptom, while this mouse works find on other platforms (GNORM and Windows). It's a particular issue as KDE is the main OS I use every day. Confused and frustrated."
5,Best Notebook Mouse that I have used,"I have used quite a few notebook mice over the years(microsoft and other logitech) and he VX Revolution is by far the best. I currently have 3 of these mice and use them with an IBM laptop (using the logitech setpoint software) and 2 Apple laptops (powerbook G4 and macbook). I don't utilize the logitech software on the Apple machines as I have had problems with it, I utilize Steermouse and it works great (costs @ $20).The main thing that I like about this mouse is the size/shape and the placement of the buttons. With the software I can configure the button actions for the way that I work.I can't recommend this mouse higher."
1,Works Intermittently When Selecting,"As other reviewers posted, must be the receiver dongle. When selecting an area or text, it almost always takes at least 5 times to select properly. It just loses connection and either doesn't select or selects a section of what you are trying to select. A very frustrating mouse..."
4,Great mouse but may have messed up computer,This is a great mouse but I am using it with an lenovo and after an update of the logitec software some of the features on my touch pad do not work any more so buyers watch out.
3,BEWARE: VX Revolution CLM4N is NOT DURABLE,"I really like this mouse, it's an excellent device on so many levels, but it is NOT DURABLE as a portable device ought to be.On separate occasions, I have had two of these mice experience a SINGLE, minor drop (3') onto carpet, and they each no longer work.So, if you're a professional who has to carry your mouse around meeting to meeting on campus and you have any potential of dropping it, be prepared for it to be a resident of the gadget graveyard.11.Jul.2007 Update: THREE IS A CHARM. I've now had three of these mice crap out due to very minor drops. I give up and will be moving on to another product."
4,Best notebook mouse yet,"I really like this mouse. After using it for a couple of weeks, I'm still not using all of its capability.. but getting closer. I find that I don't use the Zoom function and for me the side scrolling capability of the scroll wheel is a bit awkward, so I don't use that much either. Yet. I do like the free-wheeling feature of the scroll wheel - can't beat it for long docs. The battery monitor thinks the battery is still good for another 94 days... can't beat that. It's smaller than the MX700 I use with my desktop machine, and I think switching back and forth has slowed my bonding with the VX Revolution. Overall, definitely recommended."
3,Pretty good but watch out for the software.,"My impression of Logitech is that they are a PC company and don't put much emphasis on Macs. Nothing about this product changed my opinion but if you're a PC user the following may not apply to you.The ergonomics of this mouse are great as is the rolling wheel. To my great surprise the wireless seems to work fine, too.With the software installed, things went downhill in a hurry. It managed to bring down the gray curtain of death in OS X (nearly impossible to do) twice, in two days.But even without software you still get two buttons and a zippy wheel and it beats the Mighty Mouse, hands down."
4,nice to see the price drop,Best notebook mouse that I have owned but the original price was a bit steep.
3,Beware Logitech Rebates,"I purchased this item at the beginning of January. It had a rebate of $20 to be sent in 6-12 wks. I just got a postcard near the end of April stating that the item was not bought during the specified time period-it was, & I was not getting my $20. So silly me thinking that they would correct the problem AND send me my $20 in a timely manner, called Logitech. Well. they SAID it was now corrected but I would have to wait another 6-12wks! What wonderful service! They even had the gall to imply it was my fault that it was taking so long because I didn't call to verify there was a problem. Apparently I can't rely on them to do there own jobs. Since when did I become a Logitech employee? I guess they must need that $20 really bad. They will if they keep up the crappy service...."
3,Good mouse if you intend to use it for less than a year,"This is a fantastic mouse in terms of comfort and functionality. Real pleasure to work with! However, Logitech's build quality and quality control have worsened so much in the last few years, to the point where even top-of the line, expensive mice like this one, last a year before becoming unusable. I would expect a $70 mouse to last 3 years or more. To top it off, their support must be the worst in the industry -- no toll-free support, long hold times on paid long-distance calls, no ability to even email them without creating an account on their support site. To summarize, if you don't mind paying $70 every year for a good mouse, this one is for you. There are some alternatives: Microsoft's mice are quickly catching up in quality, or you can get imitations from Asus, Gigabyte, HP, etc., which are not so good, but they cost $10 -- you can buy a mouse every two months and still be ahead."
3,Good but the MX is better,I lost this and couldn't have been happier :)Bought the MX instead with the unifying receiver and it's a far better mouse and is on sale now for $39.99The MX comes with a nice pouch which you can use to carry it around in your bag and not scratch it.Plus the hyper scrolling option is built into the wheelThe forward/back buttons are also much more comfortable than the VX
3,A serviceable mouse on the go,"I first bought the Revolution because I wanted a mouse to play WoW on my MacBookPro. I chose a cordless mouse to maximize my mobility. The Revolution connects to the computer with a small dongle that sticks out about an inch. Most of the time this wasn't a problem, but one one occasion Indy ran by and knocked over my laptop. The computer was fine (thank you MagSafe adapter!), but the USB dongle snapped clean off and I had to replace the mouse.The Revolution has a nice form factor. I have small hands, and the Revolution is a smaller mouse. It is ergonomically designed and I never have any wrist pain when using it, even after hours and hours of scrolling and clicking. It is reasonably accurate without noticeable lag. the ""Hyper-scroll"" feature is great for heavy surfing and certain games. The battery life is reasonable - I have to change the two AAs about once every 3-4 months."
4,Works well,"This is a great little travel mouse. Very accurate and easy to setup. I use it for CAD work when travelling, and the customization of the buttons is a real bonus."
3,Great Mouse but my Scroll doesn't work some of the time,I love this mouse but for some reason even after installing the Mac Drivers (which weren't included on the CD :( It just doesn't seem to be reading the scroll wheel movements consistently. Sometimes it works sometimes I scroll in ratchet mode and nothing happens. Works 75% of the time. I'm really hoping it's just this specific mouse. I'm going to try returning it and see if another one has same problems. I'd be interested in hearing if another Mac uses has seen or not seen this problem.I'd really give it one star but am hoping it's just this specific mouse. If it worked 5
2,"Great shape, bad performance.","Ive had this mouse for about 3 months now and I must say it is terrible. The roller semi works and the laser often lags quite badly. What I really like about this mouse is the shape, it fits in my hand perfectly. The zoom button thing is very useful, the forward and back button are convenient, and the search button is awesome. But if the laser and roller dont work well, whats it worth? 2 stars is the answer."
4,Logitech VX Revolution Cordless mouse,This is an awsome mouse and my favorite of all the mice I have purchased or used over the years. It is listed as a notebook mouse but I use it on my desktop. It fits the hand well and is plenty big enough. The price is the only drawback at $55 but I am still glad I bought it.
3,Cordless mouse is handy w/ laptop computer,"This allows mouse use w/ your laptop and bypasses the mouse-pad.The need to use a USB port to activate the wireless part is somewhat of a drawback.However, I also got a DynaDock ( docking-station), directly from Toshiba, which provided me w/ plenty USB ports."
2,Great quality construction - 1.5yr lifespan on left click,"This mouse feels extremely quality on the construction side. There is one notable issue, I've had 2 of these purchased at roughly the same time. Both lasted approx 1.5 yrs. The left click has started to go on both. At first I thought it was my imagination but, then a buddy started using one of these (I gave it to him due to the potential clicking issue..warned him about it as well).Also when I use the mouse for 3-4 hours it started to cramp my pinky a little.The quality feel of this mouse is awesome - I enjoy the build, button location, everything except the lifespan.. 1.5 yrs till left click dies - very sad.EDIT:I suggest the logitech m705 marathon mouse - it feels almost as good quality-wise and the shape is almost exactly the same.I have a few of the m705s now and find them to be a suitable replacement for the vx revolution"
4,Logitech mouse/Mac G4 laptop,"My second logitech wireless mouse. My first lasted 2.5 yearsduring hard use everyday until it just stopped working.This mouse's features are nice and the scroll roller is largerand easier to use. My one gripe is that after a period of inactivityit takes like 30-40 seconds for the mouse to ""reconnect"" and work,whereas my previous model had no such problem.Maybe theres something in the control panel that might fix this."
2,bad software,"I installed and uninstalled the software twice since the software slow down the computer, which is currently a top of the line machine. Left click some times doesn't work and for desktop icon, you need to double click. The wheel will stop working after a while for IE. I have to drag the bar scroll bar and some time even that won't work since left click doesn't work. Before installing and after uninstalling the software, things go back to normal. The second installation is the new version of their software."
1,too much effort needed on index finger,This mouse is overrated. I am right handed and have struggled with tendinitis in my right index finger. Bought this expensive mouse hoping the effort required to press the buttons on the mouse will be very light. However to my dismay it is quite high even more than the cheap corded mouse'. Not worth it for my use. I need something that will be a relief to my stressed out index finger.
1,Not Mac compatable,"This mouse does a lot of tricks but it doesn't scroll on OS 10.4.8.The Indian suport team of Menaka and Vignesvaran wanted me to test my mouse on an ealier version of OS 10. My Mac upgrades automatically and I don't have a computer test lab. I think that is Logitechs job. I demanded my money back, they refused. They offered a new mouse after I returned this one at my expense. I previously had great respect for Logitech products. Their shabby tech support has changed my opinion and my buying habits.Very dissapointing!"
2,Flaky Mouse,Pros:* the mouse fits nicely in my hand* the spinning scroll wheel is great for quick scrollingCons:* the mouse is flakey and only works some of the time with my laptop* no drivers for Windows Vista (maybe next year)Overall I'm pretty unimpressed with this mouse.
2,Poor Quality Nice Design,"I liked the style, look and feel of this mouse so much that I could not wait for online shipping and bought one from local Bestbuy. As it turned out, with all those great features like forward/backward button and all, the wheel was so loose and out of control that I had to return it.Then again I really liked the forward/backward button, so I ordered one from online. This time the wheel was even worse. It's way too hyper. It's so fast that it not only would not stop where I want it to but also made my head dizzy. Also the point is a little shaky, even though the rest of the features are really great."
1,Expensive and unreliable,"I've owned this model for one year and have had problems several times. Finally, a few days ago, it just stopped all together. For a piece of hardware that cost me over $50, I expected a longer life! And, of course, the warranty has expired. Very poor quality control at Logitech, that is for sure."
3,"Great mouse, flawed software (for Mac OS X)","I love the size of the mouse and the shape of it which makes it really comfortable to use. The free spinning wheel is great for scrolling through documents although it makes middle clicking a little difficult. The zoom button is almost useless though, as you have to push/pull really hard for it to respond. Similarly the search button isn't positioned well which makes me forget it's even there most of the time. The back and forward buttons are great though and I've come to rely on them heavily from my previous MX Duo wireless mouse.Unfortunately though, even with the latest version of Logitech Control Center (2.1.3) on my MacBook Pro, the configuration software hangs/freezes most of the time (System Preferences Plugin). The LCC functions don't work most of the time after taking the MacBook Pro out of sleep mode (forward & backward buttons don't work as programmed). Hopefully they'll address these issues in a future update."
2,Narrow at the base = hand cramping,"This mouse has some great features like option of 'click scrolling' or 'free scrolling' wheel. The narrow base in the back, where the heel of the hand rests, caused discomfort for both myself and my husband. We gave it to friend who has very narrow hands. It fit her perfectly."
2,I will stick with wired mouses.,I could not get this wireless mouse to work very well and changing its functions and sensitivity was too cumbersome.
4,Well worth purchase,"I'm glad I bought this. Wonderful features and I love how you can customize the buttons for different programs - just open up the logitech software, select the program, and select from a set of functions or create your own. Laser is wonderful, mouse is smooth, and scrolling is fantastic. Though the scrolling has issues with pdf documents (it's slow and it sometimes scrolls the opposite direction you intend), it's a feature that will never make me want to go back to traditional scroll wheels."
4,Awesome product!,"This is my first wireless mouse that I have used. I used mainly for a laptop which is great to use. I like all of the extra buttons, it made simple things faster. Such as the side thumb buttons, you can go back or forward on your web browser or back and forth between folders in your computer. The zoom buttons are useful for photoshop.Though the battery life when I used it was around a one month span, depending how often I use it for my laptop. It also seems to lag at certain times because the frequency is the same as wifi. It will only lag for a few seconds or it may also ""jump"" to the other side of the screen.I originally paid close to $50 when this first came out and today, I still think it is one of the best wireless mouses out there. Never failed me once nor broke on me. I take care of the electronics I buy. It feels nice, looks elegant, and convenient to use!"
1,"Terrible support, fragile, fits weird in hand.","At first I loved this mouse because of the features but then the wireless USB adapter bent a little and a resistor came off.I tried to solder the resistor back on but it didn't work all the time so I decided to get help from Logitech. They said I had to buy a replacement part and they didn't attempt to fix it as an warranty item. Their web site had the part to be ordered but their online order form didn't work so I had to call them and order it. I did so, and even after paying a ridiculous amount for shipping such a small part, I still haven't gotten it a month later.Other annoyances are having to change the battery, the battery never fitting right and sometimes coming loose inside while using the mouse, and since it's small, it doesn't fit quite right in my hand even though my hands are small and after using it for 3 months, I never really got used to it."
4,Great Mouse,"As usual, Logitech comes with a great product. That's why I consider it the best mice and keyboard manufacture.I've been using the VX Revolution for almost a month, and I can tell it's very ergonomic, uses low energy from the battery (I think one battery can last for months) and the best of all, it's very precise.Well, it's a great option for laptop users."
1,a very disappointing product,"I've bought this mouse to replace my old, legendryV500 logitech mouse notebook. I did it especiallyto get the laser precision and motion smoothness.The new version fails on the very basics: clicksnot always work and sometimes it misses movements.the result is a very frustrating experience, thatdid not allow me to enjoy the more advanced features.I'm back to the good old v500.."
1,2 Down,"I really like the way this mouse functions, but..After a couple of months, the left button no longer worked consistantly. Logitech replaced it. The second one lasted for an even shorter time. Again, it was the left button, only this time it quit working all together. I'm not sure if I will bother trying to get it replaced. My old Logitech MX400 is still working well."
3,Mouse is good but the scroll wheel sucks after a few months,"Hi everyone, I've been reading many cases of MX/VX Revolution's scroll wheel getting stuck/sticky after a few month's of usage. From what I've read, this is due to the rubber on the wheel getting loose and rubbing against the inside of the mouse - SEEMS LIKE INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THE MOUSE. PLEASE CHECK AT THE LOGITECH FORUMS BEFORE DECIDING ON THIS MOUSE"
3,Driver issues..,"I've got this for my new Vista laptop and found that there's a problem with it.. I installed the driver and I plug in the USB receiver, and it told me that it requires a new driver..? I tried to update the newest from Logitech and the same problem still occur. Anyway, Vista always tell me that I have to install the driver.. and once I check please update online it said it don't have any driver for it. When I click no not remind again, the mouse stopped working.I have found a solution but it's kinda annoying. Everytime I turn on my computer with the receiver, I will have to click ""Remind me next time"" for three times and the mouse will work fine. I really hope Logitech can update their driver more often.. It's really a bad experience for me."
2,Not for OS X - wake up delay is way too annoying!,"So many great features, lots of buttons, easy to configure per app or globally.One HUGE problem - sleeps quickly and takes 20 seconds to wake up... 20, long agonizing seconds to finally wake up. And just to taunt you, the mouse can be controlled, you just can press any buttons. This sleep is independent of the your computer's sleep settings - it's to save battery power on the mouse.DON""T BUY IF YOU OWN A MAC."
5,It's All Good!,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it's changed our lives! We watch all our television programs online, so this was much like having a remote control. The mouse works great and we have had zero problems. I highly recommend this product!"
3,Only worth it if IRON MAIDEN is on it,"It's about time Ozzfest had a dvd. I've been going to Ozzfest since it started back in '96, and this year was very close to being the best, until Sharon ruined it for me. Yeah I was 6th row at the San Bernardino show when it all went down. Sorry Sharon, but Bruce Dickenson spoke the truth, and never put Ozzy down. In fact he bad mouthed the egg throwers as not being true Ozzy fans, and not true metal fans. And yes like Bruce said Reality TV does suck, and yes American radio does suck. People need to know the truth, not Sharon's truth. Spin, spin, Spin. If this DVD doesn't include at least two tracks from Maiden then it's a waste of money, I'll wait for the Death on the Road DVD later this year. If it wasn't for Maiden this year, Ozzfest would have been a complete bust. Which looks like that's where it's headed next year."
1,WATCH OUT FOR EXCLUSION OF IRON MAIDEN,sharon osbourne does not like iron maiden so be careful. make sure that the dvd has plenty of maiden. they were the best band at ozzfest-hands down. maiden had more energy and talent than all the other bands. sharon was jealous of maiden for stealing the show. then she tried to replace them with velvet revoler-what a joke. by the way -the ozzfest website does not thank the fans one time for spending their money and showing up to ozzfest-and now they want to buy the dvd-save your money folks
1,ozzfest 2005 was owned by iron maiden,only buy this dvd if iron maiden commands much of the time. they were the only really good band at ozzfest. iron maiden was the best live band in the ozzfest lineup. sharon osbourne does not know how to pick good bands. she is to interested in ruining a concert for the fans-*(san bernardino august 20th)
2,Sad...,"If this is really supposed to be an Anniversary dvd, than where the hell are all the good bands that have played ozzfest in the past? The two stars i gave this dvd are for black sabbath, and thats it!!! The person who picked out the tracklist for this dvd, is obviously not a metal fan (sharon).But yeah, this dvd sucks... Don't buy it! Don't put anymore money in Sharon's pocket. [...]."
1,Thank God above,Thank God I did not preorder this item - I swear Ozzy is getting sorrier and sorrier.....I would be afraid to see what Ozzfest has in store next year
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This is a travesty for all fans of Ozzfest and metal in general. This DVD is the pinnacle of corperate BS that we have to put up with. Half of the bands on this DVD weren't even on Ozzfest! HIM, Bowling For Soup, etc, Coupled with NO IRON MAIDEN, NO IN FLAMES, NO MASTODON, NO KILLSWITCH ENGAGE, no bands anyone cared about seeing other than Sabbath.This DVD is going to bomb so bad, and I will laugh at every second of it. It deserves to bomb. No one should buy this and contribute to the crap that us real metal fans have to put up with. Maybe next year Sharon will decide to put out something with live videos of every band (specifically the bands that people went for) on a DVD. One can only hope.SHARON PLEASE DO THIS RIGHT!"
1,Refund?,"Hey i pre-ordered this thing and i was wondering if i could get a refund? I mean come on, Bowling For Soup?! My brother listens to that on XM kids radio! Wheres the real music like Maiden, BLS, MASTODON(my new fav band), and all the rest of them? What a waste of money."
2,Two Starts For Black Sabbath & Trivium (That's It),"This set is very dissapointing. Why the hell weren't Iron Maiden, System of a Down and Slipknot not included o.0 Why are crap like H.I.M. & Bowling for Soup added to this set. This set could have been awesome. The only thing good about the set is Black Sabbath & Trivium. Other that that, CRAP. Avoid this."
1,This is not Ozzfest,"I went to Ozzfest this year and it was incredible... however, this DVD is not even a shadow of what Ozzfest really was. A LOT of the bands that made it incredible are missing. First of all, there's no Iron Maiden (but i knew they would leave it out). There's no In Flames, no Shadows Fall, no Arch Enemy. Even though Anthrax and HIM are awesome bands, they were not part of the tour. I love Black Sabbath, but it would've been great if they included other songs instead of the same tired War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man. So many songs to pick from to put these.And please, Bowling For Soup??? The Mad Capsule Markets??? Alter Bridge??? WTF??? What the hell is that??? So many GREAT bands on the tour, to fill this DVD with this crap! No thanx!At least they included The Haunted, Trivium and Soilwork."
2,Let's see.........,"This is how I've estimated the order to be. I really have my doubts if the Mighty Maiden will be on this dvd. That truely is a shame though because the crowd really seemed to blossom during Maiden's set in Camden.UK Ozzfest (Donnington,UK)Black SabbathVelvet RevolverAnthraxUS Ozzfest (Camden,NJ)Rob ZombieMudvayneShadowsfall& some 2nd stage bandsI was at the Camden show front and center in the pit and didn't notice any cameras during Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, BLS and In Flames. Majority of second stage bands got some footage in and so did Muds and SF. If my thoughts are correct this will not be a history dvd. Just contain footage from this year and backstage perspective. Overall I don't expect much, it'll be a nice souvenir, thats all. Sharon knows people will buy it just for the name and that fact that somewhere down the line everyones been to an Ozzfest. If there are any disappointed Maiden fans I recommend their 'Death on the Road' dvd which will out the same date as this one."
1,The Drugs Really Got To Ozzy,"This is NOT a good retrospective on Ozzfest. It even gives it a bad name! If I were to make this DVD, I would:1. add footage from the previous Ozzfests, from the first one in 1996 to 20052. if not that, give it a more appropriate title without the anniversary part in it3. add the WHOLE 2005 lineup to it. this includes Iron Maiden and Black Label Society, Ozzy.4. take out the Bowling For Soup sets. give me a break here! they're a joke and NEVER played OzzfestWhat a joke for a anniversary set. Well, I guess Ozzfest will sink down to its own demise while Sounds of the Underground, Gigantour, and Wacken will make their way up. Shame on you, Ozzy."
3,Grow Up People,"This is a corporate industry. You are buying into the marketing, sales and promotion. That is how it works. This is what Sharon does for a living, like it or not. When you go to a concert or buy music, where to you think the money goes? Think about it.This DVD might not be your favorite but it delivers what it promises. It is what it is and you decided to buy it. Live with it.Do I like most of this DVD?...no, but that's because I like pure metal and not the mainstream crap...but that's me. I give Ozzy 5 stars and the DVD gets 3."
2,Not that great,"The Blu ray quality is not that great, what you would find in a standard dvd,. the footage itself is kinda week,. The interviews were good,. whoever decided to show the concert footage made some bad choice on video, I don't think they actually went to an ozzfest."
1,What is this crap?,"You know, just like everyone else on here, i went to Ozzfest also. The Dallas show was just amazing. So when i heard that they were going to release a DVD/CD combo, I was so stoked that i thought i would die. I mean, Ozzy, KSE, Mudvayne, Zombie, BLS, and all of the other kick ass bands that played on Ozzfest on DVD/CD was just was going to be awesome right? Wrong. When they relased the line up, I laughed and thought that it was a joke. I was hoping that it was a joke and they would state it was, but then a month went by and the line up was still the same. I mean H.I.M., Alterbridge, Bowling for soup? WTF..... I like alterbridge, but not on an Ozzfest show. The others make me sick. It saddens me that they tarnished the Ozzfest name with this crap. Dont waste your money."
1,AWFUL!!,"I read what was on this dvd and decided; I would rather let hell freeze over before buying it. I can't believe it. Zakk Wylde has played with Ozzy, spoken for Ozzy and did nothing but support Ozzy and they didn't even put BLS on this DVD. Also no Maiden! How could you disrespect the GODS of metal. I can't believe that theres nothing to do with Pantera or any former Ozzfest bands either. You would think that w/ Dimebag's (A symbol and martyr of metal)death they wouldn't even put any Pantera or pay any tribute to him. Don't get me wrong; I support Ozzy so much because he's a metal god, but theres only like four good bands on here including, Velvet Revolver, Black Sabbath, Trivium and Rob Zombie. I just can't believe they would do this and put Bowling for Soup on there!"
1,What was Ozzfest 2005 without Iron Maiden? Zilch,"What was Sharon Osbourbe thinking? First, she invites the legendary Iron Maiden for the 10th Ozzfest, then insults them on their last gig in front of a 40000+ strong crowd and then, tries to celebrate this with a DVD? This DVD does not feature the one single band that made this Ozzfest special - Iron Maiden. I went to Ozzfest 2005 only to see Iron Maiden. I didn't care for any other bands out there-screaming and yelling. In fact, Ozzfest 2005 was so damned successful only because of Maiden. There were loads and loads of Maiden fans there who left as soon as Maiden were done with their set.Plus, the worst part about this DVD is that Ozzy's faithful pet dog - Zakk Wylde's band is not featured on this DVD! His performance was tolerable and would have justified 10% of the total cost of this DVD. Now the DVD is worthless. It is a waste of precious American Dollars. Avoid at all cost."
5,Loved it,"The music is beautiful and very relaxing. Good music to meditate with and very spiritual. I like to listen to it when I am relaxing or reading or just thinking,"
5,Talented Litte kids and upbeat energy in this drama,"From Sundance in 2009 to the theaters in 2010, now this film is coming to DVD, and it's a excellent independent film made exceptional by the performances from the child stars and their mother, actress Cindy Cheung, who gives a raw and emotional performance as a woman caught up in the struggle for her family to make ends meet. Even though it deals with intense issues, it's all through the eyes of the children, and it has a lighthearted energy throughout. Don't miss this movie!"
4,Mom is not good with business.,I would try to get a cleaning job. The mother is nonstop going for get rich schemes not justified by her dire straits; she's just plunging deeper and deeper into failure.
1,Huge expectations!,"this movie was on track to be one fo the best movies of my life. So much emotion, such amazing drama... then it just ends. No resolution, no nothing. My empathy in the movie turned to rage. I was so upset that I touted this movie before the release on FB, in person, sending links, posters, etc. I was already plannig on sending this DVD around to my family and friends to pay it forward, but NO! This was a slap in the face for me. My wife and I I'm very dissapointed that they never resolved anything."
5,You should buy it!,"I saw Children of Invention at an Independent Film Festival in Boston in April of 2009. I have been anxiously awaiting it's release on dvd since then.The movie gave me a window into a world I know little about: the struggle for survival of immigrants in the greater Boston area. I laughed and cried, and left the theater curious about what would happen next in the lives of the characters.As a native Bostonian, I loved seeing my city on the big screen, and portrayed accurately. Nice work, Tze!"
3,Okay for what it is,"This is okay for what it is. I really miss the Karaoke from when I lived in Asia, but for what this is, it is acceptable."
5,Excellent escapist fiction....,"I like all the MONGO books, but this was certainly a good ""dark"" one. For my money, Chesbro is a modern ERB, writting thinly ""veiled"" sci-fi, and I thoroughly enjoy his reality streching plot lines and characters."
5,"McMummy was suspenseful,yet humorous.","McMummy is a book you and your family will love to sit down andread on a dark quiet night. The reason I gave this book five stars isbecause it was suspenseful and heartpounding throughout the entire book. In my opinion, Mozie and Batty were very much like me. The story is about the boys careing for a greenhouse while the professor is away. Little did they know what secrets that it held. The boys pushed though the masacre of plants and leaves, suddenly they stopped dead in their tracks, McMummy. So take it from me, either check it out at your local library or buy it online. I hope you will enjoy the book as much as I did."
2,Uninspired,"As much as I enjoy these performers, I have to recommend against this CD. I found that the recording contained a few enjoyable tracks, but that this mostly sounded like ""one-off"" hastily produced recordings done with little thought, effort or (despite the title) passion. John Pizzarelli has recorded other instrumental CDs , and I would recommend Contrasts before this."
4,"Finally, a dose of his own medicine...","Franken overdoes the fat jokes, but otherwise this is a funny read, and a long overdue way to show Limbaugh that turnabout is very fair play. Actually, Limbaugh is only one of the targets in this book, and the funniest bits aren't even about the ""thin-skinned bully,"" as Franken quite accurately calls him; the section that really made me laugh out loud was the chapter of Franken's suggestions for additional amendments to the Constitution in the wake of the flag-burning controversy--i.e., an amendment which would forbid an exotic dancer to pick up a piece of United States currency with anything other than her hands."
3,Rush Limbaugh and Al Franken - - Can you tell them apart?,"Al Franken's politics aren't the problem with the book (although his near hero-worship of the Clintons is). And I'm not fond of Rush Limbaugh, either. What struck me, though, is how much Franken and Limbaugh, whatever the differences of opinion or waistline, resemble each other. They are both clever, snotty little kids, lovers of selective research (use only the statistics that favor your side), and firm holders of the belief that anyone who disagrees with them is so evil and so beyond the pale that any name called, any aspersion cast on character, is justified. Whether Franken has so much contempt for his fans that he would call them ""ditto heads,"" I don't know. But if it is unseemly of much-married conservatives to criticize the distintegration of the family (and it is), then it is also unseemly for someone who shares the talk-radio smartass mentality to criticize it."
3,Only so-so,"I am a moderate democrat, and I like to think I have a good sense of humor, but I didn't like this book as much as I thought I was going to. Some parts were very funny, but the gushing about the Clintons got real old real fast. I wasn't offended by anything in this book, but some of it just wasn't funny. Worth checking out from the library, but not buying."
2,"So easy, yet so hard.","It would seem so easy to attack Rush Limbaugh. The man is an egotistical, self centered, information manipulating boob. But Al Franken, who must have written this book between skits at SNL (which is also about 30% funny), seldom rises above the level of criticisms about Rush's weight. And unlike PJ O'Rourke, who he has been compared to, you get the sense that Al really doesn't feel comfortable criticizing the ""liberals"". It could be that he doesn't want to lose his good friends in power by criticizing them. A true comedian sees the humor in everything. Al Franken does not. Very disappointing."
2,Subpar comedy from a subpar presence,"Satire or no, if Franken can't print an economic graph without an obscene scribble on it, why should I believe it's true? And as for Rush and other conservatives being mean-spirited, I don't know of any who have titled a book so obnoxiously. Which political party believes that Individuals of any race or creed can't succeed on their own, and therefore need govt ""help?"" Hint: It ain't Repubs."
1,"Unless You're a Left-Wing Extremist, Don't Waste Your Time","If you read it thinking maybe this time Franken will be funny, you'll be disappointed. If you read it thinking Franken will give some new political or media insight, you'll be disappointed. If you want to join the bandwagon of angry left-wing mud-slinging, you will not be disappointed. Franken used to perform a boring little segment on SNL in which he spoke to himself in the mirror. He repeatedly self-affirmed his superior self-worth. I think perhaps he is the character and has expanded his philosophy to include the repeated process of tearing all those around him that differ in philosophy. More's the shame for him. We do not truly elevate ourselves by insulting others. There is always room for political differences and even humorous commentary on those differences. But there is never a call for mean-spirited slander. Reader, rise above the hate and do not bother wasting your time on this book."
1,Who's the idiot?,"How about this: Al Frankin is a big fat idiot! You lefties claim to be victims of hate from the Right, but loook at this book's title. Is Frankin so stupid that he can only conjure words like ""big,"" ""fat,"" and ""idoit."" He could've said, ""...is an enormously rotund fool."" But Al, not Rush, is the idiot. I suggest to all you people going ga-ga over this bound scrap paper should try thinking with a standard human intellect."
1,Mentioning Rush Limbaugh in your title WILL boost sales!!!,"Other than that, however, I found little substance in this otherwise unfunny book. My sister-in-law purchased my copy as a gift, knowing I listened regularly to Rush. I thought that maybe Al Franken would have something of interest to say regarding Rush --- instead, he just poked fun at Limbaugh's weight, which is somewhat out-of-date now (Has Franken even SEEN Rush lately?) I never thought Franken was that funny to begin with. He's even less so in print. Note to sister-in-law: Next time I'd prefer a gift-subscription to the LIMBAUGH LETTER!"
1,let's not resort to name calling,"I suppose the way to win an arguement is to attack the opposition personally? So often liberals that can't win arguements resort to this. Stuart Smalley (Al's signiture SNL character) would have writen a better book. Not a single sentence backs his arguements. I'm willing to listen to the opposition if they have an arguement. This book doesn't. Constantly criticizing Rush's weight (which makes little sense now considering Rush is thinner than HE is now!) and spouting vulgarity about his past. Praising homosexuality and CHOICE of immorality....Christians-don't even touch this book. It's even an insult to LIBERALS considering it gives another example of name calling, WHINING (good grief-the whining!), and extreme socialist beliefs."
1,A bitter man rambles on...,"Franken is the only idiot here.His writing style is boring, biased, and not funny.His intense jealousy of Limbaugh shows patheticaly through his writng...."
1,"I agree with Al, and I STILL thought the book was bad!!!","Dear Al Franken,Please stop writing books. You're terrible at it.I agree with all your philosophical presuppositions, but the book is truly a chore to read, and not at all funny. Go back to SNL (if they'd take you), make a movie, get a talk show, SOMETHING... but please stop writing books.You're not good enough; you're not smart enough; and goshdarnit, if you continue this behavior NO ONE will like you."
1,Big Fat Waste of Paper and Ink,"I'm no ditto-head and I've enjoyed Mr. Franken's humor on occasion but this is a sorry attempt at discrediting Rush. It's loaded with inaccuracies and lies of Mr. Franken's own. The cheap shots come across as hateful rather than funny. The arguments given to support his positions are embarrassing. I appreciate someone having a strong political position but those positions should be based on rational thinking, not demagoguery. Mr. Franken should stick to humor and leave politics to those with a little more intellect."
2,Funny but far to leftist,"Al Franken and Rush Limbaugh deserve each other much in the same way Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr deserve each other. Both are idiots in some way. The book is fairly funny, but just too darn liberal in its approach. Franken believes in large government taking care of all problems, big taxes to punish productive people, handouts to those that don't want to work and he would advocate for homosexuality to be portrayed positively in every classroom. Thats great liberal thinking but too liberal for most Americans to swallow. So read the book for the humor but don't get caught up in his nonsensical political point of view. Rush has some faults, but Franken able to match most of those with equal or greater idiocy."
1,Sick and Twisted,"If you enjoy giving your money to someone as sick and twisted as Al Franken, buy this book. If you think drug addiction if funny, buy this book. If you think seeing a cop ""push someones head down into the car"" is funny, buy this book NOW! You won't regret it."
1,Fantabulous!,"Al Franken has always been a favortie of mine. But his writing, and in general his physical appearance is just mind boggling how bad it can be! Franken's first got to get his glasses on and read the facts, and how, if the whole world were ruled by the liberal free ideas he establishes, the Earth would decide to stray from it's orbit with freedom. This little heap of gibberish was the worst purchase I've made in a while, and that includes N'SYNC and Britney Spears albums."
1,Liberal author attempts to discredit Limbaugh,"Okay, first of all it seems that Democrats are getting angrier and angrier that they cannot possibly find a liberal equal to the conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Instead of making observations that have any sane foundation, Al Franken instead resorts to a kindergarden mentality of simply calling names i.e. the book's title ""Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot."" Give it up, this book is simply a stale attempt to descredit a man who has actually earned the right to comment on political events. If you want to read a kindergardener's name calling masterpiece, read this book. If you want to learn and think for yourself, listen to Limbaugh."
1,Franken's freedom....,"to write slop is protected by the blood of American patriots who defend liberty. Liberals enjoy freedom to act like fools, but don't want to pay the enormous cost to keep it. This book is fitting for a good old fashioned book burning."
1,Al Franken is an ugly socialist idiot,"This book is a piece of garbage, just like his new radio show. it's very funny when the leading lineup for Al Franken's 'Air of America,' is an SNL washout and the lead rapper from Public Enemy. When are people gonna put down this crap, much like Mike Moore's CAPITAL LETTERS and figure out these guys are wrong on every issue."
1,Franken is an Idiot,"Once upon a time I thought Rush was an idiot, but then I listened to his show and later read HIS books. He actually knows what he is talking about. Read his book with an open mind instead of this trash."
1,WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"When I read someone described as a Satirist I think of Swift. Franken's book is a blatent, democratic propaganda medium. It is admittedly replete with lies and exaggerations. His last chapter is an unmitigated ""oral"" job on Mr. Clinton. Limbaugh is fair. I listen to him often and he allows the opposite view to be expressed. He rarely shuts callers off."
1,Libs get a life,"I would rather listen to Rush than a Liberal that worships an idolitry that worships homosexuality, communists, and i'm sorry the end of capitalism. Capitalism makes all you liberals! Give thanks to capitalism! God bless capitalism! You got something to say about it? Communist!"
1,"Stick to SNL, Al","A political commentator he ain't.This screed could have been written by that other genius Michael Moore.Borrow it, or as Abby Hoffman said 'Steal this book', but don't line this guy's pockets."
1,Hate,Just another bleeding liberal that does NOT think and lives on the drive by media lies.Received it as a gift and gave it back.Gary Sachs
1,No effect on Rush!,"I heard Rush talking about this book on his masterpiece show awhile back, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately I did, and to my surprise, it really didn't say anything worth talking about. I also noticed that the book was very vulgar and demoralizing. I would not recommend this to anyone who has morals and values."
1,What a joke!,"I read this book for the sole purpose of seeing what someone who even dared to challenge Rush has to say. And as expected, I found very few arguments worth arguing about and a bunch of dumb weight jokes."
5,A hilarious collection of political essays,Let this book stand as evidence that Al Franken is one of the funniest men in America. His incredible wit and political knowledge combine to create one incredible book. Everyone should read this book.
1,Not worth the paper it is written on.,"A good advice from an open minded guy. Don't waste your money buying this book. It is ridiculous, childish name calling, and not much substance overall."
5,"Very Funny Book . . . Angry, Yet to the Point.","RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT And other Observations, by Al Franken is probably the funniest book I had the pleasure to read. Franken, was very accurate and funny as he described the pathetic slob also known as Rush Limbaugh.Franken was also very quick to point out the hypocrisy that which the Republicans seemed to have built their political foundation on.My favorite jokes were: ""Having Al D'Amato lead an ethics investigation is like asking Bob Dornan to head up a mental health task force.""""We are now living in an era where the wall between news and entertainment has been eaten away like the cartilage in David Crosby's septum.""Over-all it's a ridiculously funny book, I even recomend buying the audio version so you can hear Al read it the way it is supossed to be read."
2,Liberals for Lyin' Times,"Past the surface humor, one must ask whether appropriation of another's (more famous) name, coupled with sophomoric slandering, is all worth a few extra sales?Sure says Al, proving he's more of a BFI than the target of his title!"
1,"Lord God, why did you make so many stupid people?","I flipped this book open to a random page in a bookstore and saw a chart of Rush Limbaugh weight over the years, and they say the right is the party of hate mongers?""The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.""- Ecclesiastes 10:2"
1,"I'd burn it, but I wouldn't want to waste the matches.","I picked this book up after seeing how funny Al DFranken was on Saturday Night Live. With his memorable writing and acting, I USED to have alot of respect for the man. Gone. All of it, gone."
1,This is not Literature!,"Al Franken is nothing more than a Hate monger who spews venomous filth under the veil of ""satire"". His book is nothing more than hate and rhetoric which has no place even in Amazon.com! I dont know who should be more ashamed Amazon.com, Al Franken, or those foolish enough to buy this garbage which is supposed to be a book! Of course it is not likely that anyone who would read this ""book"" has any shame! Al Franken has no ideas or provides any reasonable to solutions to problems, but rather just takes up people calling other people names. It is poeple like Al Franken that tarnishes the good reputation of this Great Country. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! We cannot let this hate filled trash continue to fill our streets!"
1,Didn't have a zero star,"A lot of hate in this book. Of course, for individuals that have written good reviews of this book probably hate Mr. Limbaugh too. What Mr. Franken lacks in intelligence, he makes up for with stupidity. What a shame it is to have so many people waste good energy on trying to bring someone else down to make them feel better. I'm glad I just borrowed the book."
5,Al Franken's Great American Novel,This book is so imaginative that I am ashamed that I didn't write it.It made me laugh so hard that milk squirted out of my nose. Now that says a lot for a dead guy.
1,Diatribe as politics,"Liberals will love this one and Conservatives should too because of the cultural revolution it signals. As we have come to expect, liberals like Franken lynch their political foes for being human while ignoring the attrocities of their gauche friends.Conservatives should rejoice that the most important book from the Left this decade was written by a bitter, washed-up comic. Franken's message is shrill and sour."
1,More fun than staring at a brick wall!,"OK, so maybe staring at a brick wall is more fun than reading this catastrophe on paper. If Al hadn't tacked ""fat"" on the title of his book, it probably would have only sold half of the current sales are. Newsflash to Al: you aren't exactly a handsome charmer either. No offense Al, really! ;)"
2,RIGHT WING WILL SMASH!,"Al Franken is a pathetic example of the inherent weakness of scum-sucking liberal scum. Rush Limbaugh will continue to smash the weak with his zinging attacks on Cadillac driving welfare moms. Don't worry, people. We'll all be goose stepping in no time. You're all a bunch of commies, anyway, like my ""friend"" Al ""The Commie Welfare Mom"" Franken."
2,The sound of gunfire you hear...,"...is humorist/ comedian Al Franken shooting himself in the foot. The title of this book is really a description of far too great a percentage of its content--sniping at Rush Limbaugh over his build as if both were still in junior high. There are entire chapters given over to it. Is this the same guy who played ""Saturday Night Live's"" effete Stuart Smalley, who treated his own identity crisis using a mirror? I felt cheated, after buying both of Limbaugh's books so that I'd know what I was talking about when I took issue with his ideas with Conservative acquaintances (they only SAY Liberals are knee-jerk naysayers). Now here comes one of America's most skilled political humorists making like a seventh-grader. There are some valid points in this book. But BOY do you have to dig for them!"
2,mixed bag,"First of all, I will reluctantly admit that Al Franken is fun to read. He definitely has a great potential as a writer. I will also admit that many of his criticisms of conservatives are right on target. However, Franken, just like Limbaugh, often oversimplifies complex issues and indulges in unnecessary Ad Hominem attacks. For example, calling Buchanan ""a Nazi lover,"" even if it was meant as a joke, is hardly appropriate. Most of the serious conclusions in this book are supported more often by wit than common sense."
4,Hilarious and true,"I got a great laugh reading this book. How anyone can believe in Rush Limbaugh is scary and sickening and Franken details the why behind it. This realization alone however would tend to just make you feel mad and bitter, but Franken makes you laugh it off. Great amusement."
4,"Fat or thin, Limbaugh's still an idiot","If ever there was a self-serving, egotistical, pusillanimous bag of wind that deserved skewering it's got to be El Rushbo. What's great about this book is that Franken took pains to do some research (or to have his researcher do some research) to show exactly where Limbaugh's pompous pronouncements veer rather wildly from reality. There have actually been other books devoted to pointing out specific instances of Rush inaccuracies/gross exaggerations/half truths/outright lies, but this one gives you the most yuks for your buck."
2,Good fun,"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot : And Other Observations By Al Franken ...Al Franken is no stranger to good fun and zany humor. In Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot : And Other Observations he pull's no punches when he takes the true story and compares it to Rush's propaganda. It is fun and will give anyone who has ever listened to the big guy a good chuckle. Franken doesn't poke fun at Rush himself, rather at what he says on his popular radio show. After listing to Rush's on going diatribe blaming liberalism for all the problems in heaven and on earth, it is good fun to have a laugh about it. Franken doesn't stop there, he rips up a Congress person or two just for fun. This book offers a bright humorous look at some of the right wing hype we all know is outside any democracy. Franken writes with a fun light hearted look at the tons of political hype we live with everyday. Good Fun. (2.5 Stars.)"
3,"Funny, but still socialist gobbledygook","Let's face it, Al Franken is funny, and he makes a few points. But overall he is a typical late 20th century Democrat, hurling personal epithets at conservatives rather than debating issues at length. I would highly recommend to any conservative who wants to attempt to understand the liberal point of view, or any socialist Democrat seeking vindication.This book simply proves that reason and personal accountability are to people like Franken what kryptonite is to Superman. Maybe he should pick up the Constitution...and discover what federal government is really allowed to do. No, wait, that would require critical thinking and an embracing of capitalism. By the way, what did Al do with the royalties from this book?"
1,laughable,"using admitted half truths and out of context quotes, not to mention 1st grade name calling in the title. Just another example of how the extreme left is on their last leg. its almost fun watching these last ditch efforts."
1,What Ever Happened To Al Frankin?,I have only one word for Al Frankin as a comedian and author:Bronx Cheer aka Raspberry.
1,Absolutely AMAZING!,"It astounds me...that a person could write a book with so few facts! If possible, I would have given this work zero stars. Words to describe the foulness of this vile work do not exist in the English language. This book does not make any political points; as far as I can see, it is one big series of personal attacks, lies, and half truths. Such figures as Bill O'Reilly have proven Franken to be a 'factual contortionist,' to put it euphmistically, a liar, to be blunt.To close, it would be fun (if not appropriate) to make, in jest, an unfounded personal attack on Franken, as he does on so many others, but I find that to be repugnant behavior, suitable only for those who cannot (perhaps will not, which I say just to be fair, unlike the Author) attack on the basis of facts, ideas, and ideals.Now, I really must go and clean up my Franken-induced vomit."
1,franken is a failure,"Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh. All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you. I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al."
1,He's just not funny!,"Al Franken's career, mediocre though it was, peaked quite some time ago, and Al is now relegated to the position of court jester for the Clinton administration. If you are looking for political satire, delivered with wit, you will be sadly disappointed. Al Franken is about as subtle and witty as Beavis and Butthead, and even less interesting, if possible."
1,HORRIBLE READ!!!!,This book is total B.S. Why don't you look at the facts instead of blowing hot air out off your ass at Rush!!
1,The Title Says It All...,"I loved Al Fraken's humor on SNL, and still think ""Stuart Smally"" is the funniest creation ever!!As for this book, political discourse has sunk to a new low in this country. Especially in the past ten years! Are those who disagree with Limbaugh justified in utilizing personal attacks?Why not use humor to deconstruct Conservative thinking, rather than name calling and personal insults?If a liberal icon were called a ""Big, Fat Idiot"" in a book title, lawsuits would be pending... advocacy groups for overweight peoples would be protesting in front of book stores...Oh sure, Conservatives also ""name call."" I still believe that anyone who relies on personal insults weakens their editorial gravitas, be they liberal or conservative.Jeff Messenger, author of the novel ""The Shroud of Torrington."""
1,The Liberal Loser,"Sorry, but this book was full of falsities in its own way. I am a democrat, but I hate to think of Al Franken as a fellow comrade in politics."
2,i wonder,"I wonder how many copies of this book would have been sold WITHOUT the use of ""RUSH"" in the title.Conservative principles are ideal regardless of the lifestyles of its proponents."
1,Funnier as a U.S. senator....,"""I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, doggone it, people like me"". So says Stuart Smalley, doppelganger/alter ego of Al Franken, failed radio host, failed comedic performer from SNL and, for no comprehensible reason, United States Senator. You can add failed author to this stellar resume. While Limbaugh is by no means perfect, the book is packed with jabs similar in juvenilia with the book's title. This book is not even worth a conservative's time."
3,Political Satire,"The title of this book is the funniest thing about it.It kind of downhill after that.That may be partly because I'm not that politically minded a person.Frankly I was not all that familiar with most of the people mentioned in the book.A great deal of the book was not humorous, but just political."
1,"what a nasty, meanspirited, negative book","I am a liberal and I do not like what people like Limbaugh, Gingrich, Reed and republicans the like have to say but this is a very nasty book. I dont think I've ever read a book before by someone who is so full of himself. The book is sometimes funny. Most of the time it's just badly written, cheap, meanspirited and negative. Mr Franken schould think about joining the republican party and the people he writes about. He's no better than they are. The democrats can do without people like Al Franken. Dont buy this book. It's a waste of money."
4,Would've prefered to give it 3 1/2,"I love Al Franken and I have since SNL, and as a fan of him the book did not disappoint. This book is a satiric look at the whole game of politics. I loved the way he mimicked Limbaugh's style; it was priceless. Some of the chapters had me laughing out loud. I did find the book a little long, slow, and inconsistent at times. He took the jokes a bit to far (especially the fat jokes) so they lost their effect. It's a fine line to know how long to keep a joke going, and he missed a few times. Last, the book, in some ways, seemed dated to me, at least as a Canadian who hasn't heard much from Limbaugh in a long time."
2,Franken is no idiot. (He is a subhuman though).,"Reading through a cavalcade of unintelligent Ditto-head musings, I'm convinced that none of them really understand Franken's polemics. More than half of them smacking of the same tactics of mass-denunciation that they claim Franken employs. First of all, I think this opus is one of the most insidious piece of literature put out by the left, tantamount to Shavian-level genius. Second, Franken is intellegent enough to know that if he wrote a book criticizing this person for the Republican party, that his (Limbaugh's) blind followers would by it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the book is full of contridictions and bending over for a cheap laugh along the way, blah, blah, blah. So what? The dumb goys went out and bought it and made the misanthropic Jew even wealthier. Echoing Dorian Grey's thoughts about the Jewish playwrite in Wilde's Dorian Grey ""A most offensive brute."" To me yes. But he dosen't have my money (not that he needs it)."
1,PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING~~~~~~~~,I am a 21 year old who is going through drug addiction which is a desease. I struggle every day to stay sober and change my life. Going through detox and showing up to my meetings every day is hard. I had the same addiction as Rush did and I pray for myself and everyone else with addictions. You DO NOT know an addiction until you have one. For someone as sick as this nut to make fun of Rush and other people in books and not confronting them is childish and sounds like he has a insecurity problem. IF you dont like the man dont lisen to him. You dont have to write a damn book to slander him!!!!!!!! Notice how there has not been a book written slandering Al Franken by the people he has slandered?? Well they are being real men and women and not playing his childish games. Al write a book on something positive for once!!
1,A Bunch of Sissies,"I haven't actually read this book. I'm 14 and a Republican. But what's really annoying is how immature Al Franken and everyone else is. Naming your book 'Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot' is just so immature. For crying out loud, 2nd graders do that kind of thing. So is Mr. Mauro's book: Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron'. How immature can you get? Instead of discussing your problems like a normal mature adult, everyone's writing books about how 'hypocritical' and liars everyone is. Grow up."
1,"Al Franken is a sick, perverted Socialist","This book is so dull and sick, that it probably makes Stuart Saves his Family seem funny (Oh wait, you probably didn't see it either). Franken's humor is aimed at Limbaugh's weight rather than his political ideas. In the process of insulting obese Americans, Franken also manages to slide in sick Mormon, pornographic, abortion, and Christian value jabs. Not only is this dark humor insulting to American traditions and the US Constitution, but there are no humorous aspects. Perhaps if he understood Limbaugh's conservative doctrine he could make a decent argument in this horrid monograph. But unfortunately, Franken's intellectual lapses forces him to resort to ""fat"" jokes and manipulative tactics in gaining conservative resources. Finally, this guys lucky he's had talent like Mike Myers and Adam Sandler on SNL, or he'd be supersizing burgers at McDonalds (Heaven knows he couldn't live off of Stuart Saves His Family)."
1,IS THIS TITLE NECESSARY?,"I realize Al Franken is being humorous in calling Rush Limbaugh a big fat idiot, but the tone of it is telling. I think it speaks for itself. It seems to indicate that where substance is not in his favor, he will substitute it with put-downs. It gets laughs, I guess, but does not inform.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SU[PERMAN""STWRITES@AOL.COM"
1,A satirist tunred character assassin,"I'm an admirer of Rush Limbaugh, but read Mr Franken's book because I enjoyed his satire when he appeared on the old ""Saturday Night Live"" show. I expected Rush Limbaugh and the conservative viewpoint to be satirized. Instead, the book was primarily an attempt to assassinate the character of Mr. Limbaugh and a couple of other prominent conservatives. Disappointing. I guess I should have given closer consideration of the book's title."
1,Merde not worth lining your birdcage with...,"Franken, who evidently left his former SNL buddy ""Davis"" behind for fame and fortune (or whatever Franken is actually known for), is not worthy of wiping Rush's, uh, well, you know, let's just say Rush's ""glorious naked body"".Franken is looking to become a SENATOR (!) from Minnesota, but he would not even consider running for dog catcher in Texas. He KNOWS better!Franken is a short, four-eyed, bushy-haired, lisping, self-aggrandizing, sphincter portraying himself as a quasi-intellectual.Franken shows that he is as nasty, arrogant, and intolerant as most liberals typically are.Hey Franken:Rush just EARNED a contract for $38 million per YEAR. Ha ha ha ha ha!!Can't wait to see your envious liberal screed on that little fact.Here's a philisophical question for you:=========================================If Franken orally brain farted on the rarely heard ""Air America"" liberal talk radio show, did ANYONE hear him???"
1,Don't let Al spread his Socialism!,"I don't understand how liberals like Al don't realize that the government isn't always going to be there to use up our tax dollars and help out people who are too lazy to get a job. Here is an excellent excerpt from Rush's The Way Things Ought To Be:""Wealth distribution does not equalize peoples. It destroys wealth. This ugly part of history does not teach us that capitalism does not work. Quite the contrary: It teaches us the socialism does not work; that liberalism is a failed ideology; and that it's time we invested in the individual rather than in Big Brother to solve our problems.""I didn't see anything in your book arguing this, Al! Was it that you knew you couldn't?"
1,For the sake of your country: don't believe Al Franken!,"Hopefully this book's ideas will eventually be a lost cause, or otherwise we will have ourselves a political crisis. OK, so maybe Al is right saying that Rush is fat. So what? What difference is that going to make in your book besides give a few crude people a laugh? The fact is Al, that your book doesn't do diddly squat to hurt the Republican ideology. So what if you made up a couple funny skits such as ""Operation Chickenhawk""? That doesn't argue anything of Rush's. So what if he is divorced? Millions of people are divorced, so does that mean that you are going to call them f****** idiots like you called Rush in your book? So as a conclusion I would just like to say that your book doesn't really show anything, besides what little matureness you have."
2,Franken is funny; this is not,"Heard an abrdged version of RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT ANDOTHER OBSERVATIONS, written and read by Al Franken . . . thisis one case where I was really glad that I did not have to go through the whole book . . . I just didn't find this funny at all . . . just a lot of name-calling and very politcal, but much of the material involved names that I just didn't know--and I even follow politics somewhat . . . don't get me wrong; I like Franken and enjoyed his second book, WHY NOT ME? (the story of the dramatic rise and dizzying fall of Franken, whowould have become the first Jewish president of the United States) . . . also, I loved LATELINE . . . this was an NBC sitcom about a vain reporter for a fictinal news program . . . unfortunately, it was only on for too short a period of time . . . the same, unfortunately, can't be said for Franken's RUSH LIMBAUGH . . . it went on and on far too long!"
1,Franken is the Big Fat Idiot and is not to be trusted.,"Commmenting on my own listening talents on Mr. Limbaugh's Radio program. Rush is a Paragon of common sense and when he's at his true best is when he parodies Clinton, Gore, the Clinton-Gore administraation, The feminists and the liberal establishment. Coming from a conservative background I find it a joy to listen to the Rush Tri-hours daily as I go along with my entrepreneurial work at the office."
3,It's pretty funny.,"Well, I'll admit, I am probably what most people would refer to as a liberial, but I do think Mr. Franken does concentrate a tad too much on Rush's weight. Although he does prove the inaccuracies that the extreme right likes to put forth and hold onto like a rusty bear trap, i.e. the example of George Bush commenting on the ""improbable harm"" that melting ice caps would cause, that anyone with a 7th grade science education could disprove. And the falicy of some ""leading"" conservatives making a case of Clinton's advoidence of the draft during Vietnam, which becomes quite clear once their service records are reviewed. This book is no more harsh than a typical Rush rant, (its just written a little bit better) which is bit of a dissapointment, since Al was obviously educated better than that. But I believe this could be enjoyed by anyone, if read with an open mind, as all books should be read."
5,Hilarious,"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. IMHO anyone who is proud of the title ""dittohead"" needs to learn to think for themselves. Blindly following someone and parroting what they say during arguments is not a sign of intelligence"
4,Franken attacks Rush for his factual errors and exaggeration,This book is one of the few texts that attacks the right in a humorous and unrestrained manner. Only right wing fanatics won't appreciate it.
2,Childish Franken Strikes again,"Al Franken's book, ""Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot"", tells before even being opened, exactly what to expect. The sometimes admired, often ignored commentator spews forth from his nonsensical head a never ending and childish mess of name calling and whining, held by some non-thinkers as ""fact"" and still more as ""truth"". It is entertaining, make no qualms, but in a ""worlds scariest police cashes"" kind of way. You know who's wrong, but you can't help but route for him a little."
4,Funny and accurate,Al Franken's book is not only funny but suprisingly detailed in its skewering of the republicans. Franken unearths every shred of hipocrosy and contradiction other liberals miss. He mocks the seriousness of political books but also provides better information than most. He shows that the puffed up arrogance of the Right has nothing to do with fact. With the republicans riding high you can't afford to miss this.
3,"Great idea, mediocre execution","I wanted to laugh harder, but, I just don't think that this book was particularly well-written. Al Franken must have read Woody Allen's books. Franken tries to write like Allen, but, misses.The content, however, the facts and ideas behind the observations, are priceless.I have to laugh at the ""reviewers' who hadn't even read the book- and admitted it. DIDIOTS!I have to laugh at the ""reviewers"" who pity poor Rush and his addiction. They condemn Franken for making fun of a poor addict. THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN THE MID 1990s! Learn to read! YOU DIDIOTS!!What scares me is that these people vote. What scares me more is that they vote for people like Bush. What scares me is that they reproduce.I give the book 5 stars for ideas, 1 or 2 stars for writing."
1,Irrelevent,While trying to be amusing Franken concentrates on the minor misstatements by Limbaugh and fails to produce any meaningful criticism of Rush's conservative viewpoint.
3,"I have never read this book, but i have something to say.","For all those who have been saying that Mr. Al Fraken has been resorting to name-calling and that this book is a waste. I highly doubt that you have read this book, mainly because you are against democratic and liberal views. Well, maybe if you read the book (you don't have to agree with it), you may be ""suprised"" to find out that it is much more than ""name calling."" I myself am a democrat, and I see the conflict between republicans and democrats extremely immature and childish. We are America, not 2 seperate parties fighting for power. But it seems that people have let their immature motives get in the way of the real American dream. One of those people being Rush Limbaugh."
1,Pathetic.,"Rush Limbaug is a person that has a lot of enemies. However, he has never called his opponents idiots.It is sad to see any potential discourse opened with insults. The book is poorly writen, has no substance. DON""T BUY THIS BOOK."
1,Al Franken falls short on attempt to cash in on Rush's name,"If this book did not contain ""Rush Limbaugh"" in the title, I doubt that I would have had to cough up the 45 cents for a copy of it.I've been an SNL fan for years, in no small part due to Franken's writing. He should have stopped while he was ahead.This book, while having flashes of humor, is betrayed by it's title and it's author's inability to stray from jokes that my 4 year old woould think are ""too easy.""For the 45 cents it will cost you to get your own copy (compared to $14.00 to get a ""used copy"" of anything Limbaugh has written), you can almost get a whole can of soda pop. I'd keep the cash, look for 20 more pennies, and enjoy a refreshing drink!The only number to shrink faster than Rush's waist size was the price of this book. While Rush is no longer ""Big"" or ""Fat"", and never has been an ""Idiot"", this literary dung pile still languishes in obscurity. Read 2 chapters (If you have the stomach and the time) and you'll see why!"
2,I'm a fan of Rush's,"So obviously I don't like this book - but that doesn't mean I don't think it shouldn't be read.In order to make a decision about anyone, you need to see both sides of the issue. Then, it should be easy to see that issues are black and white, someone is right and someone is wrong.I lean a little on the side of Rush Limbaugh.If you've got a Kindle, check outThe Rush Limbaugh Report. ""I listen to Rush Limbaugh, so you don't have to.""Heh heh. Okay, I just wanted to get in that line, which I think is a clever one. But seriously, before making any judgments about Limbaugh, actually listen to his program for a couple of weeks. Yes, he has some annoying schticks, but overall he makes a lot of sense - if you're the kind of person who dreams of America not as it ever was but as it was supposed to be - the ideal, Americns of all races, creeds and colors, legal immigrants, et al, standing on their own two feet and making this country great."
1,Consider the source,"It appears that Mr.Franken is not capable of rendering any logical rational whatsoever. All that can be said about this book is summerized with the ignorant title. Al has no fact or logic to what he states, it is all subjective blatherings. But then again what can you expect from a low talent comedian, even his career as a jokester has been a complete failure!"
1,"Al Franken is a Big, Fat, Sorry Excuse of a Comedian","This book is just another attempt to revive his lame career in the entertainment business. Al Franken is about as funny as watching grass grow. Anyone see Stuart Saves His Family? What a piece of ... that was. Al Franken was never funny on Saturday Night Live, has never made a funny movie or written a funny book. Give it up Al, you ..., whenever your stupid bit was on SNL, everyone changed the channel. If all you have is your stupid Stuart Smalley character, you are truely pathetic. Your impersonations on SNL ... too."
3,"It's Entertainment, Folks","What people do not understand is that Rush Limbaugh, Al Franken, et al, are first and foremost entertainers. Their job is to entertain, not to have a serious debate about the issues. Both Rush and Al pick and choose which facts to back up their views. Both take things out of context. Both propose simple solutions to complex problems.This book, like Rush's, are for people who want entertainment, not a serious discussion of the issues."
5,Hilarious! yet truthful.,"It's really, really funny. Al Franken unravel Rush Limbaugh's lies and all the republican's hypocricy in the most humorous fashion. This book is just not only funny, but informative as well; Did you know that Newt Gingrich -- who attacks Bill Clinton for destroying the family values in the U.S. -- divorced his wife in the hospital with cancer? AND did not pay the alimony for his OWN kids until he was forced to in court? I really hope that all the Americans could read this book and learn about what's wrong with the U.S. politics today - while you laugh your butt off."
4,Politically charged fun.,"Telling it like it is, Al Franken provides us with wonderful insights into his political wit and all out rants of Rush Limbaugh's weight and political sayings.Al does it all here. From true stories, to visuals, to fake Vietnam chronicles, to jokes, to an imaginary death of his research assistant, he presents his views in a hilarious and gripping manner.It's sometimes smart, sometimes random, rarely vicious, but always funny. Also, it's a great, quick read. The language is fluid and the writing style is conversational. It's like stand-up comedy mixed with CNN Crossfire.... , I still recommend this."
5,THE GREATEST ENTERTAINMENT OF ALL MEDIA!,"This book is not only the best book I've ever read, but the most entertaining thing of any type of media that I ever enjoyed. The biting truth of Franken's cuts at the Republican party is very satisfying to read."
4,Hilarious Critique of Limbaugh & Followers,"This book was a quick and entertaining read. Franken annihilates Limbaugh's claims and exposes him for the publicity hound/hatemonger/hypocrite that he is. Unfortunately, in the process Franken employs a lot of the very tactics he criticizes, such as mocking Limbaugh for his weight problem--that's why I won't give it five full stars."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"Al couldn't have spent more than a week on this, and is obviously coasting on his Saturday Night Live fame. It's unclear if this book (which isn't fat) was supposed to be provocative or humourous, because you can't print a laugh track. I challenge any reader to find two decent jokes, which, even then, would come to $3 per weight reference. So why? Save your six bucks."
1,Not a very convincing arguement.,"Although disguised as a satire, the author tries to convince the reader that conservatism (exemplified by Rush Limbaugh) is a failed political platform. Unfortunately, like all liberals, he doesn't let facts get in the way of his argument. The book is somewhat vulgar, in spite of the fact that Al Franken is a rather funny fellow. This book did, however, reinforce my conservative beliefs."
1,Lies,"Lies, lies and distortions. Al Franken is a BIG FAT LIAR. Try listening to the real deal. You might learn something. In fact I guarantee it. The people in Minnysorta clearly suffer from brain freeze. Don't waste your time or money on this trash."
1,"Dull, unfunny book masquerading as humor","Mr. Franken, it appears, is trying to be the Left's answer to Rush Limbaugh. However, he has failed miserably with this book. His ""humor"" is either not funny or just insulting (at times, both). It is quite likely that the success the book enjoyed was due mainly to people who loved the provactive title (one wonders how well the tome would have done had it only had Franken's name on it. For example, anyone remember ""Late Line"" or ""Stuart Saves His Family""?). Do yourself a favor if you want to laugh at something with an occasional political tinge and read ""Rants"". And Al Franken, do yourself (and everyone else) a favor. Leave the political humor to Dennis Miller, someone who knows what he's doing."
5,Core Power / Innovative / Grounding / Fun!,"Sadie's CorePower DVD is awesome! It has a flow that leaves you feeling not only energized but grounded when you are done. Constant reminders to activate the core have me doing it even as I sit here. It becomes a mantra to keep in mind through all movement. Her waterfall warrior and fists of fire, for example, I haven't seen in any other video or class, and they add so much to the poses they are incorporated into. And my gosh, the workout! It really targets areas that you forgot you owned, if you choose to go to your own edge. She does offer alternatives for the difficult moves so you can choose your own workout level as you go. Thanks for the inspiration! :)Sandy Krzyzanowski"
2,misleading DVD information,"I do enjoy this DVD, but I paid $20 for it and it doesn't have the information it states on the DVD cover. It says there are bonus features and three different 20 minute segments but all mine has is 1 mat section and one wall section. It also doesn't have the triple view features it discovers. I wish amazon could refund my money or send me one with the features I paid for! But I do enjoy Sadie"
5,"Not for beginners, but great for intermediate/advanced","I dont recommend this video for newbies to yoga, but as a long, long time intermediate level yoga, I really like her flow. Its a little unusual, but the instruction is very good, and its a nice change up. Very good for the core."
2,Vinyasa or yoga calisthetics?,"I bought all three of Sadie's core vinyasa dvds. They are not yoga vinyasa as I'd hoped. They are yoga/pilates style calisthetics and maybe that's what other people want but the term ""vinyasa"" threw me. Anyway, if you're looking for yoga vinyasa as in Rodney Yee style you aren't going to find it with these."
3,good workout...not my style,"I am really searching for a new yoga DVD that delivers a thorough practice and results and doesn't make me really hope no one is watching. This one has a lot of advanced elements, which i think is great, and yet is do-able for intermediates and possibly beginners. I know it's vinyasa, but it's a VERY flowy/dancing sort of yoga that I personally cannot embrace. (Think dancers at Burning Man) If you like that, then this is your video. If you are looking for a more traditional practice, look elsewhere. I am glad I experienced it for experiences sake though."
5,"Enjoyable practice, right amount of challenge","I bought this DVD after waching the free videos accessible through Sadies website. I've been practicing yoga from dvd's for just over a year. This dvd gives me everything I want from my practice- poses that are challenging but do-able (still breathing but definitely feeling like your getting a workout), narrators voice is easy to listen to (doesnt become annoying after 10 or more times watching). I used the beginners commentary the first time and found the advice useful. I'll be honest and say that I'm pretty comfortable with the first 40 minutes but I have to work up a little courage for the wall section- but I'm confident I'll get there in the end and Im happy there's something here that pushes the boundaries a bit more! I have been trying to convince my less yoga minded family to give this a go because I think they'd enjoy it without getting bored. Well worth the money- i feel fitter and stronger."
3,Good but felt a little ripped off.,"I decided to buy this DVD because my girlfriend attends her Manhattan studio and raved about her. I thought what she did show was difficult, but could easily be modified for beginners. However, after looking at the format and reviews of her other DVD (total body transformation for weight loss) I feel ripped off. This DVD is only 1 hour of material. I know it is called power hour - but not two many different poses were fit into that hour. If you want a taste of Sadie I don't recommend purchasing this DVD..not much there."
5,A classic!,Waited all season for it! And it did not let me down. I Wish they still made them like this.
5,The Best Christmas Video Ever!,Every Christmas season I look forward to the music and movies and stories! Absolute favorite of all is Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!
4,Great Holiday Video but One Technical Problem,"I think the picture and sound are fine on this DVD. My 3-year old daughter loves the film. I noticed, however, that on two of my DVD players, the DVD is playing the Spanish version even though I have not selected that version. I'm curious if anyone else has had this problem."
3,Theres no better way to celbrate the holidays!,"What a better way to celebrate the holidays. Your holiday is just not complete without this, your whole family will enjoy it. This is a personal favorite of mine. The acting is great and the music is excellent. A must have."
5,A blast from the past...,"Okay, so I'm reliving the past with this classic... And classic it is. If you're a sap over the holidays, and still expect the jolly big dude, to be coming down your chimney on Christmas eve, then this is a video for you.As a matter of fact, three of recent Santa Clause movies that really get me into the spirit are the Tim Allen movies by Disney: The Santa Clause 1, 2, and 3. Great movies (along with this classic) to watch on a cold Winter's night...The Santa Clause"
1,"Visually great, Soundtrack Problems","First of all, let me say that this is my favorite TV special of all time and this DVD is visually excellent and clear, however, there's seems to be something wrong with the music soundtrack. On several songs, it sounds as though someone is messing with the Pitch control for the music, making it sometimes unbearable to listen to. This is especially apparent during ""There's always Tomorrow."" It sounds so off key in spots, you want to cover your ears. I hope Sony realizes this defect and reissues it with a fixed soundtrack. Until then, I guess I still have to watch the VHS version. I was looking so forward to getting this on DVD and was extremely disappointed by it. Guess I should ask for my money back, but it does look great."
1,Still NOT completely remastered,"In the item notes for this DVD it claims it is remastered. Though it is not as poor quality as the 2004 DVD, it still has black dots and white scratches in the picture. Is CBS the only place you can find the completely remastered version? This is NOT worth $14.99, more like $4.99. Remaster the thing or don't supply it. :("
3,"The Sound track is a disgrace, SONY do it over!","I really looked forward to replacing my VHS from Family Home Entertainment with a quality DVD. What a surprise when the SOUNDTRACK warbled and dragged! It is unbelievable that such a classic would be released with so little respect for the beautiful songs and voices, now garbled. It is unlistenable!This is such a classic that it would easily be worth reissueing with an improved soundtrack. Please do it over!(While your at it, get the frosty the snowman series on to DVD too.)"
1,"Classic, Not Classy",I didn't like this movie because I didn't like the pompous Santa and I didn't like the island of unwanted toys. That was sad. I also didn't like the reindeer because they were a snotty little clique. They just pretended to be nice to Rudolf when they thought he'd solve their problem on a foggy night.The only funny part was when the elf wanted to be a dentist and put teeth in the dolls so they could chew.
1,The snow monster doesn't have a toothache?,"In this ""CBS"" version, they pull out all the snow monsters teeth to tame him. Not because he has a tooth ache. Then Yukon makes fun of the fact that the Snow Monster can't do anything mean any more. That is not the way I, or anyone else I have talked to, remember it. Becareful which version you get because there seems to be a bunch of them."
5,Great movie,"Christmas classic! Great condition, love the classics. Movie I grew up on and now my son is too! Great buy"
5,Children Loved It!,"Had no problems with the delivery, and the children were always asking for it during the Christmas season. There are a couple of extra music videos that I don't particularly care for, but how many people acutally go through all the extras on a regular baisis? The actually movie is the original version that has the song ""We're a Couple of Misfits"" instead of ""Fame and Fourtune"", which was added the year after the original was released. I actually perfer this as it guides the theme of the movie toward overcoming obstacles, and being yourself. In my opinion, the ""Fame and Fortune"" song completely changes the moral of the the show. I gave it five stars becuase the things added in the extra features section can never take away from the magic of this movie."
3,Pillsbury Commercial?,"Overall, I'm happy with this disc. But I dropped the rating by two stars because of the Pillsbury commercial at the beginning of the program. C'mon, Sony. Was this really necessary? I thought we saw the last of this kind of thing in the 80's. Does anyone remember the candy bar ads at the beginning of the videos for Moonstruck and Dirty Dancing? Or the early Disney DVDs with the promos that you couldn't skip over? It's not a good idea to annoy your customers."
4,A neglected classic.,"Charming, well-made, and with nary a car chase or half-clad babe anywhere. Burl Ives' voice alone is worth the price."
5,Both Beautiful And Sad At The Same Time- A Review By Mary Sanders,"Every Chritmas Eve, for as long as I can remember I either watched this classic cartoon with my father, or at my Aunt's Christmas Eve party. I have always loved it, and the story. The animation is clever, and charming.Anyway, this story is about a cute little fawn named Rudolph. It starts out with his birth, and unlike haveing a black nose like the other deer, he has a lovely (at least in my opinion) glowing red nose. His parents are embarassed by him, and try to cover it up with mud to make it appear normal. Later, as he gets a little older, he is shunned by the other deer just for being different. Even Santa Claus hates him (yes, in this movie he is a real mean jerk). But Rudolph's crush-Clarice likes him for who he is. I shall say no more, but this movie carries a strong message: It doesn't matter how great-looking you are on the outside- but how beautiful, and kind you are on the inside. Try it."
1,Out-of-sync Soundtrack Ruins Whole Show,"It didn't take more than two minutes for me to notice that the soundtrack on this DVD was a second or two out of sync. As a result the dialogue starts before the characters start to move their mouths and then ends and the mouths continue to move!!! I hoped that at some point the audio would get back on track, but from beginning to end it never improves, making the whole show painful to watch.HOW on earth could so obvious a defect have been overlooked? It is outrageous that this sub-standard product made it past quality control and was passed on to unsuspecting customers. Sadly, this is not the only problem with this version of Rudolph. But since the issue with the audio is so completely egregious there is simply no point in taking the time to comment on anything else."
1,Rudy what have they done!,The DVD transfer is pretty good but the scene with Yukon discovering peppermint has been cut.It seems pretty odd to sell a DVD as a restored classic only to leave out the main thing that was to be restored!
1,Why? Sony. Why?,"For 2 years in a row Sony once again puts that stupid Destiny's Child crap on this Dvd. Why does Sony keep ruining Christmas classics like this and now Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town with a stupid Mariah Carey video. When is this dumb so-called trend going to stop. Leave the Christmas classics(Rudolf,Frosty,Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town)as is.Please, NO MORE EXTRA SONGS & VIDEOS...these are not good extras they are just pure crap!!!"
1,I am the Edit Avenger! 1 star for besmirching a classic!,"Yes, it is I, the Edit Avenger!!Here to protect freedom and original art from plunderous corporations and soulless individuals!!!!If you are considering purchasing a 2004 or later release of 'Rudolph', think twice. It is edited.I just ordered the original 2002 UNEDITED/no Destiny's Child 'Rudolph' DVD from eBay express. I got it sealed for $6.99 + $3 shipping.Do NOT buy edited DVDs when you can avoid it. Let's send the message. If you don't think that you make a difference remember this:Consumer complaints about the edits in 'Beavis and Butthead Mike Judge Collection Vol 1' were 100% of the reason that volumes 2 and 3 were released with absolutely NO edits whatsoever to the material.Good for us!Edits are for losers!I have spoken."
1,Amazon just copied these reviews from the original version,"Watch out! Amazon has just copied these reviews from the original version of this classic which DOES NOT include the Destiny's Child garbage extras. It looks like the original, uncut version is no longer sold by Amazon but is available from other sellers. Be careful and get the original!!!"
1,dvd re-release,"i think the destiny's child video idea is horrible. that puts an urban tag on something which should be timeless & for a wide variety of fans not just urban/hip hop fans, this is not ""the PJ's"" dvd boxed set by will vinton studios. i think that the dvd should have instead included a retrospective look 'celebration' of the television special including commentary by arthur rankin jr & jules bass while showing pages from the making of book by Rick Goldschmidt. other than that the re-instated scenes were a fantastic bonus."
4,A classic kids movie,"Bought this for my parrot as he loves animated movies and cartoons. He likes this one at Christmas time, and it is a childhood classic for us!"
5,prompt,"Daughter ruined her first dvd, she watches it all the time! I ordered and received dvd from the shipper extremely fast!"
3,Missing ONE VERY important item!,"Where the heck is the Rankin/Bass production credit jingle at the end of the show????You know..the white & blue Rankin/Bass logo with that catchy and memorable 60's Rankin/Bass sound clip that is at the end of the cartoon!!Sony Wonder......You goofed BIG TIME here!!Otherwise....Rudolph's great as ever, every Christmas!"
5,Still my favorite.,"This is probably the best animated Christmas story of all and definitely one of the most remembered. Who can forget about Sam the Snowman, Herbie (I want to be a dentist), Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable Snow Monster, and of course, Rudolph. I have watched this every year for at least the last 25 years. But now I don't have to check the TV Guide to find out when it's coming on. I can watch it whenever I want. When I was young, I used to wonder if my toys talked (wonder if this is where Toy Story got their idea). A perfect family movie that will make you laugh, cry, and be a little frightened. Excellent is all I have left to say."
5,thanks,"thanks for making my xmas season bright! I dont have regular television to catch this yearlymovie, so now I can watch it anytime I want!!! I came fast, and the packaging was great!"
4,Why all the Blu Ray reviews?,This is the listing for the 2010 DVD so why is it full of reviews of the Blu Ray release? I would like to see reviews of the actual regular DVD release.
5,Pure Silver AND Gold,I don't know anything about the Destiny's Child controversy a lot of the reviews mention since my old VHS is nothing but the Burl Ives Rudolph I remember from my childhood. This wonderful Christmas special has several classic songs but what I really love about it is the theme of misfits finding their own special place in the world. Definitely worth watching every holiday season.
2,way too complicated for most people,"""Supertraining"" is just too complicated for anyone looking for workout ideas. It has plenty of graphs and charts to prove theories. If you like that kind of thing-have at it. Personally, it does not have enough training advice and workout ideas for me. After really trying to read it for 2 days, I became bored."
2,Looks good but made poorly,"I really loved the way this looked in the photo but when i got in the mail, it didn't look nearly as nice and was impossible to put together. And after all the hard work I put into it, the stupid thing still leaned to the right. So i called my best bud who happens to be a machinist. The guy can fix ANYTHING, and even he wanted to throw the lamp ot of the nearest window!"
4,Good mood music,"This is EXCELLENT mood music for halloween parties, role playing games, ghost story telling etc. Nox mixes little flashes of techno with what is recognizable as classic pulp horror film music to create that creepy mood that you need from time to time. You probably won't pop this in your standard mp3 mix to play on random, but the music does stand on its own (its not just loops like most mood music), so you can actually do that if this is ""your style""."
5,Yet another great album!,"Nox Arcana is truly a original band for the era. The music is never boring and you always find something new when listening to it that you may not have heard before. Vargo is a very gifted artist in all the work he does and I for one am glad he formed his own band. The creative work behind the cd's really comes through not just in the music but in the album designs. Midnight Syndicate lost one of the most creative person's behind their success, but by starting the band Nox Arcana at least none of the fans are suffering. Keep up the great work and I look forward to the next album."
4,An Outstanding Movie That I Can't Get! Help!,"This is an outstanding adaptation of an outstanding play by Craig Lucas, following the surreal adventures of an optimistic housewife once she narrowly escapes death by a hitman hired by her own husband. I can't seem to find a copy of this film in a USA-friendly format, and I'm desperate to do so, because it's really one of my favorites. Highly recommended--- very funny, touching, and completely original. PLEASE, whoever controls the rights to this film--- make it available on DVD for American audiences! In the meanwhile, for those who can view the available format, I strongly recommend it!"
5,Don't have the disc but have all the songs...,"I think Joey did a great job compiling these tracks. It's great to see some of the later lesser known tracks on here that Rock hard and fast! ""Mama's Boy"" from ""Too Tough Too Die"" just shows how the crew grew into deeper stuff. Looking over these tracks, there isn't a bad cut in the lot! Joey has good taste! May he forever rest in peace!"
3,Pretty Good Collection,"This is a pretty good Ramones collection. IT would be a good starting point for someone whos never heard the Ramones before. Its interesting to see Johnny's picking all his favorite Ramones songs.However, I feel that 'Ramones Mania' is the real album to get introduced to the Ramones with. The songs on that album are alot more balanced than Loud fast ramones.I dont really like the way this cd is mixed. The songs are put in chronological order, and I would have prefered them to be mixed up, giving them a better feel.Also, this cd doesnt have enough songs from the Ramones new stuff. Am I the only person in the world who likes the Ramones new stuff? *Sigh*On the plus side, this record contains alot of lesser known songs like Garden of Serenity, Highest trail above, Main Man, and I Wanted Everything.Overall a pretty good greatest hits album, but get Ramones Mania instead."
5,THE original,"THE original punk band.If you like the Ramones,this is THE cd to buy.If you're just starting to get into the Ramones,or don't have any of their cds,this is the one.With some of their most popular hits, ""I wanna be sedated"",""Blitzbkrieg Bop"",""Judy is a punk"" and ""The KKK took my baby away"" this is a must for any lover of punk music."
4,Where's 'Bonzo Goes to Bitburg?,"The Ramones are awesome but 'Bonzo Goes to Bitburg' is one of their 3 best songs in my opinion. I own this compilation, and even though a lot of the songs sound a lot alike, it still is awesome. But if you want a Ramones Greatest Hits album, get one with 'Bonzo' in addition to 'Blitzkrieg Bop' 'I Wanna Be Sedated' and 'Rock and Roll High School.'"
5,Best compilation of this band,"This is by far the best compilation album the Ramones have to offer. This selection of songs reflects the hard punch they delivered for many years. Too bad they're gone. They were the first punk band and influenced many bands to follow. These songs span their career in chronological order starting with songs from the first album, a classic in itself all the way to their stuff in the end. If you were to own only one Ramones CD, buy this one."
2,Only a Slice of the Pie,"If you've only heard the Ramones on the radio, pick up this disc and think of it as a gateway into the world of the Ramones. But that is all it is - a starting point. If you truly want to know what the Ramones were about, buy all their albums through Pleasant Dreams and play them in chronological order. Then play them again in the same order, except remove the last album. Repeat this until you're only playing Ramones. Choose your own ""toughest hits"". Odds are they will be very different from what's on this album.The ""bonus"" disc of some live stuff from 1985 is nice, but it doesn't save this package."
5,RaMoNeS,"There are a lot of neat hits on this album that are classic if you like the Ramones. It's what started punk rock, resulting in the birth of BLINK-182. {I'd just like to know what Elvis Presley would sound like in a band with Buddy Holly}. That's a little different, though. I'm just saying if you like the Ramones, you will probably like this album."
1,first punk band???,"Of course I know this is the first ""punk"" band, but it sounds nothing like true punk... if they have ""hits"" they are NOT punk they are pop-punk. Pop-punk is good to, but this band just sounds horrible. Punk is about having edge and rebeling and not caring about being on the radio. This band sounds like none of those. If you want to hear some true punk. Pick up a NOFX or anti-flag CD not this pop-punk trash."
5,and 5 stars for the doctor as well,"Dr. Copperman was my husband's and my family doctor for about 10 years. Besides trailblazing and saving the world, she also saved the rest of us little people in middle America. It becomes more difficult with each passing decade to find a doctor as caring and competent as she. Read this book - it was written by a true heroine."
2,May not work on your DVD player...,I have a one year old Zenith 5 disc DVD player and it doesn't work for me.
4,"A quick, fun read","The back cover description was correct - you are left wondering which Mike Beau ends up with as you read page after page of witty, honest writing. A fun read that made me feel nostalgic for the good ole days, but also grateful for the life I have with my husband and two sons. Check it out!"
3,Fair,"This Red Dress Ink entry is fairly clever. Our main character is married to Mike, but flashes back to whether she should have married Mike - the other one. Conveniently, the Mike she did not marry appears magically just when she is having doubts about her choice of Mikes.I thought the basic premise of the book was quite clever. Although I am not a fan of the jumping from past to present, it was done well and was obviously needed in order to give us the proper information.As with a lot of chick lit stuff, I got irritated with the main character here. She seems to live ONLY for her children and is entirely focused on pleasing everyone around her - except herself - a fact that is distressingly appearing more and more in chick lit.I also enjoy this author's books and I give this one 3 stars - unfortunately, it was not as witty or fun to read as her ""slightly..."" series.Still, not a bad read and I would recommend it."
2,Entertaining but predictable,"The book was a quick read, but there were subtle hints as to which Mike Beau married. I would have preferred more imagery. As much as I was able to relate to the 80's, I would have liked more descriptions. I enjoy Wendy Markham's books, but I think that this book was not up to par."
1,POOR QUALITY,"UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ITEM, WHEN I UNZIPPED BAG FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE TOP ENTRY ZIPPER BROKE.COMPLAINED TO SELLER,NO RESPONSE--THIS WAS IN 2010.I AM CURRENTLY(MAY 2011)USING THE BAG WITH FASTENER CLIPS I GOT FROM OFFICE SUPPLY STORE.THIS THING WAS MADE IN CHINA."
5,Answers to your Questions About a Course in Miracles,"Although Sandy Crume claims she is and always will be more than a ""student"" in the Course in Miracles, it's obvious that it has been a major life-changing experience for her and for dozens of people who have studied with her. This little book is well worth a read for anyone who has a void in his or her life ... and isn't that most of us? Sandy's take on a Course in Miracles is that it shows us how to reconnect with our spiritual nature ... and, as a result, connect with all the souls around us. It's more than a wonderful idea. It's a wonderful way of life. Miracles do happen, all the time. And this book may be the first step to finding them in your own life."
1,It's Plastic,"When we ordered this we expected the classic, wooden, Thomas at the Airport set. Since their was no picture or detailed description available we were surprised and disappointed to find that this is a plastic-type set. :-("
2,Do not watch this if you are interested in the book,"I am a big fan of Colin Firth, so was excited to see that he was in an adaptation of Dorian Grey. However, the story line of this movie has VERY little to do with the novel. They created a whole big deal about Dorian's grandfather beating him and completely revised the sequencing and occurence of events. If you want a movie with sex, drugs and Victorian rock & roll, watch this movie. If you want a movie version of The Picture of Dorian Grey, avoid this version. So sorry, Colin, but you should have read the book before you consented to the script!"
2,Wake me up when it's over!,"We never finished watching this. But we gave it an hour of our life that we won't get back either. The story line didn't flow very well and scenes would come in and you would wonder if you maybe fell asleep for a minute and missed something. Maybe it would have all come together at the end, but we just couldn't continue watching."
3,3 for acting anyway...,"Doesn't anyone else think that the director of this movie succeeded only in being formulaic, derivative and boring? And while you're at it, shed a few tears for the departure of subtlety in films. I felt like I was watching CSI Wilde . . ."
4,GOOD_,I didn't 'love' it_ but I liked it a lot. Colin Firth was excellent in this movie. Ben Barnes was only good in comparison- It was on the dark and sexually charged side- but it didn't commit fully- it could have been darker and sexier and been a better movie- I guess the best way to explain my opinion of the movie is that I liked it- but I felt it could have been 'more'- so I couldn't help but also be a little disappointed. The special fx for the painting was pretty cool- but even that they didn't show too much of until the very end.You do get to see some of Ben Barnes without clothes on. Mostly torso shots- but there is one scene where you get to see his back side_ he's kinda skinny and pasty- he could have put on some more muscle tone and a bit more bulk. His clothes make you think he's built better than he really is- not that he doesn't look good naked- he does!
3,Dorian Gray,Must say I was a little disappointed in the movie. To much sexual content. I thought it was the scary movie I remembered reading as a kid. Opps!
1,no n o NO NO!!!!!!!,"It`s been years since I read the Great Novel, but it seems to me that this product only uses the frame of the story; great lines and monologues from the Master Wilde is worked over, deleted or simplified....Ben Barnes may be physically right, but his personality is all wrong....Stick to the 1944 MGM version and - I know a lot of people hate it, but I don`t; - and the haunting 2006 up-date with David Gallaghar...."
2,So horribly bad,"From the beginning this film is awful. The writing is horrible, the acting is horrible. I couldn't wait for it to be over. Even Ben Barnes was over the top. Save your money and an hour and 53 minutes of your life and SKIP IT."
1,BIG FAT YUCK!,OMG this was horrible. i couldn't even finish watching it...after all the rave reviews i was really expecting hoping and waiting but after an hour i couldn't take it any more and shut it off.basically hot orphan dude with a history of abuse gets a but load of money and becomes a totally moraless hound dog banging everything that moves and then even stuff that doesn't while a painting of his reflects his dreck-a-tudeYUCK!
4,Gray Matter,"Not bad. It stays fairly true to the book as far as I can recall, though I don't remember the homoerotic elements being so blatant in the book (in spite of what Oscar Wilde's life may have been). Wilde was an incredible writer and poet and this story of sin and the supernatural is still surprisingly powerful today. I thought they did a decent job, though I haven't seen the 1945 version. The book (a short novel) is great though - I'd highly recommend reading that before seeing this. Imagination is still more powerful than CG technology.. and Wilde's wit and wisdom are MUCH better absorbed in the written form. It's not long and it's easy to get into (the book). But for what it's worth, and for those who aren't planning to read it, this film still conjures up the young ghost of a Dorian Gray, a theme that explores the ultimate worth of pleasures (and other crimes) in the face of a fading world."
3,Boring Gray,This latest version of Oscar Wilde's classic novel is nice to look at but rather dull. The characters bisexuality is more explicit than usual but the film never reaches the outrageous kinkiness of the 1970's euro trash edition.
2,Busted Illusions,"I had only half-formed notions about The Picture of Dorian Gray, both the book and the various film adaptations of said book. I've always been somewhat intrigued by the story, by the mystery of it, and the fact that it's not entirely clear in any version (save maybe the book) what, exactly, happens to the main character.My expectations were somewhat shattered when I saw this take on the story.It's definitely more of a horror film, with very specific horror-movie gags and devices. I'm not sure how one would take this film out of context - probably not too well - but even in context, I was not entirely impressed.Big motivating factors for me to see it to begin with was Colin Firth and Ben Barnes' involvement, both of whom do fine (and no one is surprised) but, again, not what I expected. In any sense.I have since picked up the book and found that it is entirely different (and better) in every way."
5,A gem,"I only knew od Dorian Gray from the LoEG...so when I saw this film I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did like the preview so I rented it. It was a fantastic and terrifying movie. I am interested in reading the book. I will watch it a couple of times to peel back the layers...this movie is a fine gem..."
4,Dorian Gray,"The product arrived on time and in the condition promised.Although the movie itself was different from the book I still found it enjoyable. Some of the party scenes are a little over the top, but not enough to make me not want to watch this movie again."
5,"I liked it, not a bad movie.","I def liked the movie, the main character Mr Gray def played his role down to a T. I had hoped it would be longer and more depth into it, but over all i loved it. Great Job on the movie."
2,2 stars because it has Colin Firth,"Really lame movie...Colin Firth is the only bright spot. The rest is over done, over sexed, and over acted. Spend your time and money elsewhere, imho."
5,Great Movie,I was hoping this would be a good version and it was. I recently read the book and was very happy the see this interpretation. The old movie from the 40's with Donna Reed is corny but this one is great. I know it was panned in the American press but they were wrong! It is great. Get it...!
1,A waste of time and expectations.,"I was excited to discover a new film version of Wilde's classic, but I was sorely disappointed with this film. Barnes is miscast and out of his depth here, Firth's man is exaggerated; the daughter is non-existent in the novel, and there are plot additions that were not necessary. (Chaplin is excellent however). For now if you want to see a better version of this story, stick to Hurd Hatfield and George Sanders."
4,Worth watching -,"It's been over 20 years since I read the novel, but have seen two movie versions and one musical stage version of the Dorian Gray tale. This does a better job than most at introducing more of the subtleties that likely would have been most important to Wilde, knowing that one's work gets mercilessly cut when being developed into a screenplay. Colin Firth, as always, gives a first rate performance as does Ben Barnes. Also to the director's credit to not send Mr Barnes to the gym so that he has a 21st century version of the hot male physique; but trusts the actor's good looks and acting to give us a beautiful Dorian whose exterior belies his ugly soul. The sex, violence, and gore that make the movie cross the line into the horror genre are not necessarily gratuitious, but effectively give us a more comprehensive version of the story."
3,Good,"If there had never been a book to compare it to, I think mostly anyone would enjoy this movie. The acting is great and the plot is intriguing. The overall themes line up with Wilde's intent. I have to admit, I found it a little scary in parts and a little drawn out during the drug/sex scenes. All in all a good film."
4,Creepy!,If you are looking for happily ever after this film is not for you. If you are looking for dark and creepy ... this film gets an A+ for thouroghly creeping me out.
4,good but i was looking for the original,"The come on in the room, had a reverend telling a story of a little old sick woman who sang the same song as in the title of this album, but slower with a very pronounced southern twang.if i could find this it would be great, but this was a nice buy as well"
5,Frosty the snowman,"This is dtill one of the best xmas cartoons for children. I love and am giving it to my great niece, shes 4on yrs old. Excellent for the whole family"
3,Frosty / Frosty Returns Values,"Both movies have their place. Most reviews slam Frosty Returns for poor values and examples yet fail to mention that the original encourages bad behaviors as well such as stealing the hat and stowing away on a train when they didn't have the money to pay for the ticket. The original is definately cuter, but shorter."
2,Great set of books -- lousy price!,"TDOT is an excellent set of books that follows major word choices throughout their development in the Hebrew scriptures (e.g., berith ""covenant,"" dabar ""word,"" hokhmah ""wisdom,"" etc.) Certainly, a biblical scholar, clergyman, or theologian would want to have all or part of this set in his or her library. Though some, like James Barr, criticized this type of ""biblical theology,"" it is nonetheless a deeply scholarly work and useful for getting at etymologies, developments in usage, and relationships with surrounding Ancient Near Eastern cultures.What is not tolerable is the price being asked for this set. Over $1,000?! You gotta be kidding me! On Amazon alone, one could buy most, if not all, of TDOT for HALF that price (and, that's even including the ridiculously-high S/H fees people ask for on Amazon).Great set . . . but, PASS on paying so much for it."
3,A Dangerous Cult,"The movie isn't very well done. I've never joined any religion myself. Back in the 1970's I had bought a book thru the mail. It was written by L. Ron Hubbard, I believe it was about Dianetics. Halfway thru the book I found it to be nothing more than rubbish, tossed into the trash. For the next 10 yrs I was continuously subjected to their mailing list. They where always trying to sell more media & suggesting that I visit their Boston location. Many times I called requesting removal. Never got involved & glad I never did. It is NOT a religious movement, nothing more than a cult."
3,"Interesting ""Science"" Lesson","I never understood the intricacies of this strange religion but this documentary certainly filled-in some gaps. No comment on the content, however I will admit that I am amazed that there are so many followers of a very peculiar man and his very unconventional philosophy."
3,Interesting documentary,I enjoyed watching the documentary. I would have liked more information about L. Ron Hubbard as well as info about the Scientology celebrity center.
2,Fails to answer one obvious question,"I feel that this documentary fails to answer one very obvious question. While it places a large focus on the high monetary cost of being a scientologist in good standing (purchasing dianetics), it fails to explain where that money goes. According to the documentary, it doesn't go to the majority of the members, because it makes their minimal pay very apparent. Does it go to helping the destitute? If so, they should be applauded for their efforts. Does it line the pockets of high ranking church officials? If so they should be ashamed. But the documentary never addresses this seemingly obvious issue. Although it allows some frustrated people to feel that they have a voice, which is good, I think it is pretty shallow in its approach and would have been better had it delved into deeper issues."
4,Can't get enough,I bought this CD for my daughters 12th Bday. She listens all the time. She is a big dancer and has a dance made-up to pretty much every song so I get to hear them over and over and over. She loves it. Great music to dance to.
2,what a pity....,".....the US-version of this Rihanna latest outing doesn't have the song ""Cry""(UK exclusive bonus track...WTF? How about her fans in the US and also from around the globe?). Another evil marketing ploy played by the people in the music industry who are milking her success while she's on heavy rotation around the world.""Reloaded"", ""Special Extended Version"", etc. It seems useless buying the first pressed cds. Because after a very SHORT while, the greedy music company will released...ooops, re-released the cd as a spanky new cd with 1 or 2 worthless track. No wonder the music industry is dying. No offence,but i am truly tired of repackaged cd, tour-version cd and all these rubbish. Sighs."
2,A 1 TRICK PONY and nothing ELSE!,"A 1 TRICK PONY!!!!! She realizes her albums only get carried by how addictive & well produced the 1st single is. I can see why she releases a new album every year. 1 song doesn't make a great album and doesn't carry it to multi platinum success. Every commercial artist these days seem to be releasing DUD albums. It's so hard to even find 4 to 5 songs that are good on any new release these days. Beyonce please take note that 10 songs does not make an album. Cassie 9 songs & 2 interludes do not make an album. As for Rihanna, your strength lies in great POP tracks. Please don't try with the ballads. In the song Unfaithful you sound like your whining non stop. Now please stick to what your good at and it's called great POP songs without a trace of R&B because I don't hear the R&B in your voice at all."
2,Music CD,The CD was mailed with a scratch on it so I can only give it 2 stars but the actual songs would definately be give a 4 or 5.
1,"rihanna is a fake,fraud,hack!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",why did this boring album get released it stinks its boring lame and soo dull and weak this is not real music at all this album stinks buy something else instead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i seriously think this album stinks buy something eldse instead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,what?,"this is a joke , right... I mean this really is a joke this person and the rest of it all. Oh my god this really is the end of civilization when someone that sounds like this gets recognized for being, good?!?"
2,She has really gone bad!,"I love me some Rihanna! I truly love her style of music. This album has really not grown on me like I thought that it would. I didn't like her first album but her second album was excellent. I mean I guess you got to grow but her music had went from bad to excellent to horrible!! I mean there are a couple of great songs like Umbrella, Push Up On Me, and Good Girl Gone Bad but the rest of it sucks!I hope she comes out with some new material ASAP!"
5,Rihanna is Hot!,"Only reason Rihanna is being compared to Beyonce is becasue people compare her to Beyonce. Rihanna is in no way shape or form trying be like, imitate, or shadow Beyonce. Rihanna makes completely different music.They are both two very good artists and they both are light-skinned and pretty. Stop comparin the two. THEY HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STYLE...RIHANNA IS MOSTLY DANCEHALL, with pop, and very little R&B; and Hip-Hop.SHE IS WITHOUT A DOUBT DOIN THE DAMN THING...UMBRELLA, SELL ME CANDY, LET ME GET DAT, PUSH UP ON ME, REHAB, and THROWIN DISHES ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST..."
2,Eh...,Rihanna has a few really good songs on here but most of them...I wasn't that crazy for...Shut up and drive is always fun.
5,The Best Album so far!,"If you ask me, Rihanna is the best pop artist out there. But this is probably her best album yet! With hits like Take a Bow, Shut up and Drive, Disturbia, Dont Stop the Music and Umbrella, this album is filled with amazing musical talent! All the different songs sound different, from the softness of Take a Bow to the rockin' out loudness of Shut up and Drive, these songs are catchy and fun, and very easy to learn all the words too. Buy this album!"
4,Bad Girl's gone Good,"OK, the other two reviewers have a bone to pick with Amazon, Pepsi points and other things completely unrelated to Rihanna's music. If you like Rihanna, this is an excellent album. Not many to choose from yet, being a young artist. But, IMHO this is a better album than her first ""Music of the Sun"", which is not an insult of her debut either. I almost gave this 5 stars just to counter the crappy, unrealistic and unrelated reviews provided by the other two people here.... but I resisted. This really is a 4 star album, with solid music, vocals, and production. if you've heard of and like Rihanna, you'll like Good Girl Gone Bad."
2,"Pop, but not that great.","After hearing the NON RAP version of ""Umbrella"", I was impressed so I dwelled into this artist. This album is nothing but sampling gone wrong. This entire collection is nothing but hip/hop fodder and isn't worthy of the chart success it's had. Shut up and drive, just shut up. The nasal vocals are enough to drive one mad."
1,Bad Girl Gone Worst,"Rihanna isn't really a great singer, and you realize this quickly after watching her sing live again and again. I've never been a big fan of her music, but this album really just isn't cutting it. She is Pop/R&B for the moment, until someone else comes along as she came along on Christina Millian, Amerie, Kelly Rowland, & other singers. They all have the same bad break-up songs & happy make-up songs. I don't know what makes Rihanna so different or better than Kelly, Amerie, Christinia Millian or Ashanti."
1,good girls gone bad reloaded,The seller sent me a copy off the cd instead ofthe real thing watch him!!
1,crap,If I hear unbrella one more time.........that is one of the worst songs ever written. Just another auto-tuned no talent hack.
3,No Pepsi Points for this one!,"this Is a great album with the addition of Take a Bow, and Disturbia; but what really sucks is that all these good albums and mp3's you CANNOT buy with Pepsi Points. Which is TOTALLY ridiculous!"
4,Please Don't Stop The Music,"I have to give Rihanna credit. I'm not a big fan of hers in general but the is a fun pop record. Almost every song makes me wanna dance. I'm glad she stepped away from ""trying"" to do ballads because she can't pull them off. But she can definitely put out a club hit."
3,"It's good, but VERY different!","I can't decide if I like this album or her last one better. Her last one had a few great songs, and the rest were so so. On this effort, I'm trying to like all the songs, but they are so NOT Rihanna or R&B like. There's techno, R&B, reggae, and even rock on here, but some songs are over produced and hard to really connect to. I think some songs would be perfect if a few instruments and computer beats were left off or whatever. Her next single is Shut Up and Drive...bad choice!"
4,better than expected,its actually very good upbeat with some slow songs. i like it it's very danceable which is good too.
3,Rihanna Reloaded Gone Bad,"Undoubtably I ordred the wrong CD because this one definately wasn't what I exspected. Im sure I meant to order Rihanna Loud, I didnt particularly care for most of the songs on this CD."
2,Not What I Expected from Rihanna,She Is Beautiful and Talented however this album in my opinion does not showcase her true ability. It almost changed her whole image and sound. I expected more and would think with producers like she has they would have made this more appealing.
1,This album SUCKS...,"I bought this album and sorry threw it into the trash. I will probably get low ratings, but I could care less, its the truth. It has a few catchy tunes, but she is a terrible SINGER!!!If you like catchy tunes, with lack of singing this albums for you, this is the farthest I am willing to go on the review...I will never buy any of her CD's again..to the others who gave her good ratings, I consider you folks die-hards...me my opinion is objective."
4,Good Girl... Real Good Album,"Must admit,I wasn't into Rihanna much until I heard Umbrella.Very slowly the song grew on me. Then Shut Up and Drive came out. It really caught me.Enough to make me buy the album. Figuring there had to be other cool songs on it.Don't Stop The Music,Rehab and Good Girl Gone Bad are the other highlights on this fine pop album.Must also admit,her look is dazzling.I look forward to her next effort .She has a new fan.I give the album solid 4 for crafty pop music. Go out and get it now,if you have been hesitant.It is real good."
4,Strong and commercial,"Rihanna has come up with a really strong set of songs. She has an interesting voice and shows it off pretty well. The strongest songs such as ""Umbrella"", ""Push Up on Me"" and ""Shut Up and Drive"" really shows her voice. Not the gretest voice, but a better then average and a pleasing sound.Well produced and orchastrated. A cd worth getting. Good, solid pop."
3,3.5 Stars,"I'm not really a Rihanna fan. I absolutely hated the songs they played on the radio from her other albums. But ""Umbrella"" is one of my favorite songs out right now so I bought the album. It was pretty much what I expected...There are 3 MAYBE 4 songs I like and the rest I skip over."
5,This good girl is better bad,"I have to say, that at first i wasnt feeling this album, but i was thinking it was going to be more like the 2nd album, but then i opened my ears and let the music sink in. This album is phenomenal. Everytime I play this cd I cant help but get up and dance. Let me get that and give me some sugar are the two big ones that i cant stop listening to. they have this beat that trap you in and the vocals go great with them. The best slow song is Rehab and Question existence, her voice is good and they are very slow and catchy. Overall all the tracks are great, but my least favorite has got to be say it. Otherwise this album is worth every cent if you love the first two albums, because its like both albums are fused into one and then some. Its a great cd."
5,Rock it Rihanna!,"This is a way cool CD. I LOVE ""Take a Bow."" Great song. The whole CD is very enjoyable!"
4,Transitional Masterpiece,"For people who may not know Rihanna is the transitional Queen! Everything Rihanna does prepares you for a drastic switch of concept. ""Music of the Sun"" to ""A Girl Like Me."" ""Good Girl Gone Bad"" to ""Rated R."" She is always ready to switch it up and keep your attention. This cd was developed to push the envelope on what she can do! My favorite song being ""Say It,"" and ""Rehab."" Rihanna has mastered the soft and hardness that every woman has. She switched it up, but still kept her uniqueness about her. The album blends Reggae-ton, rock, dance hall, pop, and R$B in one nice little genre of her own. She is really unique and has her own sound. I would encourage anyone to purchase this album if they are interested in her work. This album is what put her on the map internationally!"
5,This is why it's HOT!!,"This CD is fresh and energeitic all the way through. It's truly made for those who want to dance. R&B artist take note, Rihanna has tapped a flavor of music that's rocking the spot."
5,GO RIHANNA!!!,I THINK THIS IS ONE OF HER BEST ALBUMS. SHE REALLY SHOWS HER VERSITILITY ON THIS ONE. I CAN LISTEN TO ALMOST THE ENTIRE ALBUM AND WHEN YOU CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW ITS WORTH GETTING
2,Pass me the umbrella but keep everything else.,"""Umbrella"" is the only song on the whole album I liked because the rest sounded like utterly forgettable filler junk. What happenned?? ""Umbrella"" is nice pop-rock tune that suited Rihanna's average voice well and made her sound better. It's too bad her whole album wasn't written in mostly the same genre."
1,Another Market Ploy,So they are charging $10 after I already bought the original for $14 which contains 3 songs less. I'm not interested in all the video fluff so basically buying this would mean paying $3.33 per extra song - No thanks. A really helpful review would be to tell us where someone can trade the original CD in for this one and get the $4 + tax back???? Market scams like this doesn't make me very sympathetic to the industry cry of piracy.
4,Fried Eggs--- a short review,"I saw this on the documentary channel and it makes me want to be a father even though it would obviously be a huge headache. The music teacher in this show is my hero. This is right up there with ""To Be And To Have""."
5,Chris Sertzel,"This book is a must have for all groomers. Not only does it go over T-Touch methods, but has tons of info on positive handling behavior for issues that groomers and pet owners alike may see every day."
2,Disappointing,"TTouch may indeed be the best thing since sliced bread, but this book is not a good, ""standalone"" way to learn how to do it. I would have preferred more detail and better pictures of how to DO the touches instead of getting a book full of testimonials and so-called ""case studies."""
4,Helpful Primer.,I previewed this book via the library and then opted to purchase a copy for myself. Learning T-Touch isn't something that I have done quickly but it does seem to be helping me to help my dogs relax.
4,Cute and effective,"I saw this at a pet store when I was buying food for my pair of 3 month old kittens. They didn't know what to do with it at first (maybe it was because they were smaller than the scratcher), but once they realized it was a scratcher, they couldn't stop playing with it. They especially like the rattle tail and the crinkly ears. For some reason, one of the kitten likes chewing on the back of the dog (where the sisal part is located) while scratching it.Since I didn't stand the scratcher up and attach it to a doorknob (too heavy to be just hanging), it's just laying on the floor. I ended up putting some books under the scratcher to elevate it so the kittens can jump up onto it and play with the rattling tail at the same time."
3,Fine and Huge book,I was introduced with campbell book wile studing at University; for a course of Data Comunications.The firt part of the book is really fine; I've never used the second one. As a programmer working ocasionally with RS-232 I've found usefull the concepts explained in the book while working with serial comunications and High Level libreraries like termios under UNIX or Comm Object in VBasic
2,Not a cook book for win32 API serial port problems,"I bought (among others) this book because it is 2nd edition (errors & typos hopefully eliminated) and it had good reviews and in order to solve a serial port programming task for Datamax DMX600 barcode label printer under windows 2000 with C/C++.My book was reprinted 1999, but please note that it is 2nd edition as of October 1993, i.e. at the time of IBMPC. Today, you won't find the files IBMPC.C, UART.h, SIO.h at all in your libraries at all. Furthermore it does not deal with the 16550 UART and more modern UARTs which cause today's real world problems.Apart from that the book constains some good ""general"" language/ programming principles and lots of XMODEM C-code. As a beginner in kernel/device driver programming I missed a use case, WORKING example, and will now put the book back on the shelf and work through the WATCOM sdk ComPort example. Do not trust the ""The definite Book on the subject"" sticker on the cover page!! Rainer"
2,NOT FOR HIGDEFINITION / BLURAY EDITING......VERY POOR QUALITY,Bluray conversion quality is poor & blury and looks nothing like raw HDV footage. At first i thought it was my high definition canon camcorder but after using cyberlinks Power Producer software and LG blueray burner I noticed a hugh diffrence in picture quality and time taken to convert files. Ulead takes approx 6 hrs to convert 1 hr of HDV files to bluray wheras cyberlink's power producer takes approx 15 minutes and the video is crisp and clear.
5,Ulead Video Studio 11,"I have been a user of Video Studio since version 5. It has always been my favorite for editing mpg files. It now has more bells and whistles.We have had a problem using their SmartRender progam. It is an option when saving out a video file. We have had to turn it off to prevent locking up the computer. Other than that I love this stuff. I never had a problem with version 7,8,9 or 10. For the price it is great. The program is intuative making it easy to teach others."
2,Frustrated user,Pros: The interface is alright and it has numerous very good features.Cons:* I could not find a way to have a photo do a rotation effects and it does not seem to have it.* Annoying advertisement but could be turned off--another thing annoying about the advertisement was it's asking me to upgrade to a Ulead VideoStudio 11 plus when I already have it.* The software crashes when you do a DVD import (I'm sure not all systems will do this). I tried 4 different DVDs and all does the same thing - crash. Tech support is no help and not patient.I have not tried burning to a DVD yet...
5,Excellent transaction,I am soooooo happy. I had this software but my puter crashed and the backup I had made of the original didn't work. Glad to have this back again as I love all the features this software offers!! TYTY!
2,Dissappointed,"I bought this product right after it came out. If I had to do it all over again, I would have gone with another product. Its slow, its clunky, its tempermental and it tends to crash on my XP machine (which exceeds all the tech specs for this product).My disappointment started with the lack of support. Nowhere, after several sessions and too many hours, was I able to find out specifically what the trouble was and what the fix was. My troubles started with an update that went wrong and it has never functionned properly since then. The forums for this product are also not very helpful and queries went unanswered - not surprising as the forums are usually pretty quiet for this product, which is not a good sign. Today, it was unloaded from the system and I will not be buying again."
3,Ulead VideoStudio 11+,I bought this software a year or so ago and I still use it. But it is very buggy and unreliable and crash prone. I wish I had bought something else. But the reviews I read about other home video editing software say the same thing about them. I don't have an answer.
3,Ulead,"If you're a new to the home video editing world and you're looking for something fun and easy to use, then get Ulead. It's pretty much drag and drop.Like all software, make sure you check the home website for patches."
1,I keep getting an Unexpected error and support has not responded?,"Almost $100 for software and two hours into creating a video I get an Unexpected error and the project is deleted. I have emailed Corel/Ulead tech support and nothing. Absolutely no response. What a waste of money. I installed the software on two computers and the exact, same issue on both computers."
5,ULEAD STUDIO PLUS,"AMAZING PRODUCT, EXCELLENT BUY . NO CRATCHES, REAL HD, AND BEST OF ALL EASY TO USE."
5,Easy to use software,"Overall this is a very easy software to learn. I was able to install it and work with my files after bumping around a bit without using the manual. The only aspect of this software I did not like is compatiblity with it's Movie Factory counterpart. After editing my video I attempted to import my saved files directly into MF 6.0+ and it could not recognize the file. Other then that VideoStudio 11.0 Plus is a very easy, fairly powerful program. I would recommend it to anyone just starting out or looking to do basic to moderate video editing. For the price you can't go wrong."
3,U-Lead 11,I have an earlier version of U-Lead and somewhat disappointed that 11 wasn't much better. Especially for the price I paid.
2,need help,"currently, i am using a free trial of the software; therefore, i dont get a a help option. however, i am having trouble coverting or saving imported videos to mpeg-4 or avi that is uploadable to youtube. I need help."
5,Great Product,You can do just about anything you want to do to video with this product. I love it. Great for downloding video from any camcorder to your computer and then doing video editing. Simply Great.
2,If you have a problem... good luck. Poor support,"After reading all of the reviews and purchasing a Canon HG10 camcorder I purchased this product to make a college sports highlight film for my son. The computer I am using has Vista Ultimate and 2 gigs ram. After over 100 hours invested, the film was a flop. The high def film imported into this product had pixilation, and when the moment came to cut the DVD the software froze. The product also would not read film clips on an existing DVD.I browsed through all of the online help, but my problem was not mentioned. After working hard to find out how to contact Corel, I finally found buried on their web site a phone number. Corel permits one call, and the result was some emails on how to fix the problem emailed to me. I applied the fixes as directed and nothing helped. To me, support is the most valuable thing a vendor has to offer. Poor support means poor product. End of story."
1,No AVCHD support,Don't buy this product if you plan to create AVCHD disks to play on Blu-Ray players.I bought this product specifically to genereate AVCHD DVD's from my HD camcorder. The AVCHD disks are supposed to play on Blu-Ray disk players. They do not play on my Samsung BD-P1400. Their telephone tech support informed me that there was nothing that could be done to make it work. The AVCHD disks produced by Pannasonic and by Pinnacle play just fine on my player.
2,Ulead is ok if... you can get it loaded,"have spent hours trying to load ulead plus on my computer but because I had a ulead product on my computer prior, I have not been able ot load it. Same old message keeps coming back that I have already loaded it. Ulead people tried to help with a long detailed list of things to do to clean out any remnants of prior ulead but it has not worked. really frustrating. Be careful about buying ulead if you have had a earlier version. i have learned the hard way. Ted in Carolina"
5,An awsome book. Great for Abby Hayes and Madison Finn fans!,This is one of my favorite books! It is extreamly funny and is one of those books you can read over and over! I couldnt help cheering for Lily while I read this book. It should get a newberry medal!
5,AWESOME,this book was really worth the time...at first i was reading it for pleasure...you know one of those little girly books...but then when i read it...i was amazed...and used it for a book report....im pretty sure i will get an Aw/eread the bookand live your life to the fullestpeace outg-macks-nikhita
5,COOL,Lily b. is a normal 13 year old girl and meets the coolest friend when really is not COOL AT ALL. She sued her Family for 1.6 million dollars for something that did not happen behind her back in her Lake House.Read The Book To Find Out...!
1,Great Book if You Don't Mind Your Child Reading Swear Words,I just happened to read this book after purchasing it from our school book fair and was quite disappointed and disgusted to find that the author thinks it is appropriate to use swear words in books geared toward the 9-13 year old set.Since when is that considered age-appropriate content?
5,NIce,"I watched this soft core porn film on Cinemax one night, and it was funny, stupid, but the babes were hot and very busty."
2,to many rules,it didnt teach me that much. it was all about rules not much more..i want to know how to talk with people. basic/every day conconversation
2,May not work in your DVD player...,I have a one year old Zenith 5 disc DVD player and it doesn't work for me.
3,Good read,"Classic novel... which can make a boring read, honestly. After reading through the end, realize it's dang good read :)"
4,Morris on Philosophical Theology,This is a very good book. While Morris is not entirely balanced on all parts of the book--e.g. his chapter on God's relationship to time--this is a wonderful work as an introduction to philosophical theology. It's a shame to me that he is not currently writing more on the subject. dp
5,Refreshing and insightful scholarship,"Skarsuane provides the reader with insights into the Jewish background of early Christianity, even Gentile Christianity. It is not an overstatement to call his work exhaustive, as he covers all the bases in this 455 page work.There are 21 chapters divided into 4 parts.1.judaism and hellensim 2.Politics: jews and the roman empire3. geography: the land of israel and the diaspora 4. jerusalem: teh city of the temple 5.how many ""judaisms""? 6.jesus with judaism 7. the early jerusalem community of Christians 8.mission to the gentiles and the torah etc........Skarsaune is very thorough!I would also highly recommend Jean Danielou's ""Theology of Jewish Christianity"". It is out of print, but possible to find and it is worth the hunt!The price is also very cheap for such a work. You will be hard-pressed to find a book more detailed and readable than this one. Enjoy!"
3,Gooseberry Jam,"Gooseberry Jam is the biggest disappointment of all food-stuffs I grew up with. I have yet to find anything remotely comparable to that ""Granny"" used to make or manufactured by the three main processed food companies back home.This particular brand too - fails to meet up. All the Gooseberry Jams manufactured in the UK too fall far short.Last week I made the terrible mistake of purchasing three jars of Swedish Gooseberry Preserves from ikea ... yugh ... by far the worst.The best available in the US of A is from one of the South African Speciality Food Stores within the US.The search goes on ... sigh ..."
3,tart but it works,"I grew up eating gooseberry jam so i had high expectations and standards when i bought this jam online..It was packaged beautifully and arrived promptly, but i am afraid that while the taste is acceptable its not 5-star quality...I enjoy a sweet fruit spread, but this jam is very tart...I did not get any hint of sweetness at all unfortunately..it is, however, not bad, and has a good gooseberry taste to it...just not what i expected or desired...but, if you like your jam tart and tangy, this may well be a great match for your palate!!"
2,"It's OK, but...","like one of the reviewers said, the instruction of pronunciation is wrong, especially with single vs double consonants. The instances that comes to my mind are r/rr and z/zz. With the r/rr, they pronounce ""caro"" and ""carro"" the same way, with the trilled sound. In reality ""carro"" has the trill whereas ""caro"" does not. The ""r"" in ""caro"" is pronounced more like the ""dd"" in the English word ""ladder"".The other single/double consonants also taught incorrectly are ""z/zz"". A single ""z"" in Italian has a ""d"" sound in front of it, like in ""ad zone"". The ""zz"" is taught to sound the same as the single ""z"" when in reality it has a ""ts"" sounds like in ""hits"" or ""ritz"".Even though I'm from an Italian-American family, I know minimal Italian but enough to know how letters are pronounced. Personally, I wouldn't waste my money with this DVD."
2,Speak Italian like an American,"While watching the first DVD in this set (Italian Basics), I have discovered several inconsistencies (and I haven't even finished it yet). I was hoping to learn Italian in an entertaining way, and to learn to speak it like a native (with correct pronunciation and emphasis). They got it half right. The DVD effectively uses visuals, repetition, and dialogue to make learning some basic Italian easy and memorable. But in the first three lessons I have already found a multitude of words or letters that were pronounced in at least two different ways each, which is sloppy, to say the least. The problem for a new student is knowing which is the CORRECT pronunciation (and, YES, there IS a correct pronunciation). I will have to rely on OTHER sources to teach me which is the correct pronunciation. I wonder how much else they got wrong? Ultimately, there are some valuable tidbits of information on this DVD, but don't expect to sound like anything but an American speaking Italian."
4,Residential Animal Planet,This is the soundtrack of music for Animal Planet created by our eyeball buddies. It's about time commercial programs besides Pee Wee's Playhouse discovers and utilizes the unlimited talent posessed by our mysterious musicians!Listen to this album with your eyes closed and let your mind wander. Discover in your own head scenarios of Hunters-Hunted that the music evokes in you.
2,"Some flaws, not worth buying.","I bought this book because it uses a hands-on approach, plus I was attracted by its colourful pages and neat layout. But I was somewhat disappointed after reading it and trying out the exercises. The chapter on macros and VBA is the worst. One macro on printing slides did not work out as intended. The VBA part was poorly explained, you end up staring at lines of code and wondering the logic behind them. Another glitch is that the clipart used in the exercises may not be available to every Powerpoint 2000 user, so some of us have to take the trouble to download them from Microsoft's Live Clipart Gallery. The course coverage isn't as comprehensive as it meant to be. For instance, it does not teach you how to simulate an object (such as a bird) flying across the slide. I expect more from an advanced level book like this. My first, and probably last, book from the Shelly Cashman series."
3,Don't ever go to Rome with only this guide!,"I just returned from a trip to Europe and spent several days in Rome...So this guide gets great reviews... True, the historical and cultural sections are fine. They didn't include any colour photographs, o. k., might be their style.But to sell a - not even cheap - guide that doesn't even have an underground map?! The maps in general aren't worth the paper they're printed on. You're certain to get lost in the city if you trust this guide.If you want to bother bringing this guide along a ""real"" guide, be my guest, but I, for one, expect more of a city guide."
3,Boring,"This is an encyclopedia of furniture. The information on each subject is limited. It makes a good quick reference, but didn't help me too much.."
3,Does not work on Archos 704,It was not so obvious for me since I bought it - but the AV700 headrest adapter does NOT work with the 704. It is well built and if you have an AV700 I am sure you will be happy with this product.
4,"O.K for ""normal"" shaped headrests","I bought this for a recent vacation to the U.K where we rented a Cayenne for the 2 weeks we were there. The headrests on these SUV's are sculpted and the sling did not fit over it very well but they do on a majority of other headrests. Bottom line I guess is check your headrests first.Other than that, it was well made and did the job fine."
3,Astronomy DVD's,"This was purchased as a gift and the person who received it has enjoyed it. However, you suggested ""History of Astronomy"" which I also purchased only to find out that it was included in my first purchase ""Standard Deviants"". An attempt to return it & receive credit resulted in your sending both of them again, though thankfully not charging me. Further attempts to explain seemed pointless with your present system. I appreciate your allowing this feedback since you can now correct this & prevent someone else from ordering a duplicate DVD & getting very frustrated in their efforts to rectify."
1,Not that good,I was very happy to see a suger free option for cake but disappointed when I tried it. It leaves a bad aftertaste. It is not light and fluffy. It has the texture of cornbread. Will not purchase again.
4,Plain White Ts,"Did some screen printing on these shirts.Came out great. They are soft, somewhat durable and highly affordable. No problems."
3,"Historic, classic, but not the greatest Christmas special.","I like how it explains how all the Christmas traditions came together, but this was not the greatest Christmas special in my childhood. I never thought it was bad, I just did not like the idea of Burgermeister Meisterburger outlawing toys.because of my love for toys, I didn't quite like the idea of it, sort of my same issue with ""Toy Story."" But it is still a good special."
5,Santa Claus movie,Perfect! The classic movie! It was given as a gift to my daughter who LOVES that movie. This movie is such a classic and at a great price!
5,I love this movie!,I have such fond memories of this movie growing up. It is the story of Kris Kringle...and is a classic! A must have for Holiday DVDS!
4,Christmas delight,"This is a vintage children's classic, even the adults can still enjoy. Very creative and well put-together."
3,Hilarious. Should be MST3k'd,"I loved this as a kid. So I figured I'd get it for my kids. And they liked it too, despite the hilariously hokey special effects (hokey to them), so that's why I gave it 3 stars.But for me, for all the christmas specials, this is the worst.I couldn't believe the ""Sit on my lap"" song. Really. Some strange creep comes to town and trades kisses and lap sitting for toys - he should have been arrested for that alone.And then the way they tied everything to the song was really irritating. Plus, why did the young man have an old man's voice? Annoying."
2,"A good story, but a better one was available ...","... the Story of the real Saint Nicholas. If they had started with him as the real Nicholas was, priest and then Bishop of Myra, and told of some of his real miracles, and then added the fantasy elements of his transformation into the Santa Claus of today, it would have been an incredible classic. A perfect bridge between the Rudolph/Snow Miser type specials, and the Nestor/Little Drummer Boy ones. As it is, its a fun show with some good songs and memorable villains. But it could have been so much more."
3,Not The Best of Rankin Bass,I wasn't so thrilled with this show as a kid and I guess I'm still not. It lacks the excitement and warmth of some of the other Rankin Bass shows from the 60s. It's Ok though.
3,Santa Claus is coming to town,"The kids don't know who the characters are, but what the heck...they love it. Maybe, just maybe some kid will want to see some other work of these guys."
4,"Great, if oddly creepy at times","I love all the Rankin-Bass specials, even though they seem to come up with new origins for Santa with each one. Fantastic songs throughout, but am I the only one who finds this couplet unnerving: ""If you sit on my lap today/ a kiss a toy is the price you'll pay""?That aside, it's memorable and Keenan Wynn as the wizard guy is great."
1,Hey Sony/Classic Media! Please re-release these holiday specials properly!,I AM NOT RATING SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN WITH 1 STAR BECAUSE I THINK THIS SPECIAL ALONG WITH RUDOLPH & FROSTY ARE EXCELLENT HOLIDAY SPECIALS WITHOUT A DOUBT!!! I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS WITH 5 STARS IF IT WASN'T FOR THE $UCKY MUSIC VIDEOS THAT SONY/CLASSIC MEDIA KEEPS RELEASING ON THIS AS WELL AS THE RUDOLPH DVD'S. WHOEVER FROM SONY/CLASSIC MEDIA KEEPS COMING WITH THESE STUPID EXTRAS SHOULD BE FIRED! BRING BACK THE DVD RELEASES THAT WERE OFFERED BEFORE THE YEAR 2004 BECAUSE THIS MARIAH CAREY & DESTINY'S CHILD IS PURE CRAP AND I THINK ALOT OF THE DIE-HARD RANKIN-BASS FANS ARE FED UP WITH THESE STUPID-ASS SO-CALLED MUSIC VIDEOS!!! DO US A FAVOR SONY/CLASSIC MEDIA AND RELEASE THESE WITHOUT THE DUMB VIDEOS!
5,The Guarneri Beethoven--A Transcendental Bargain,"It's been many years since I last attempted a journey through the complete Beethoven Quartets. I'm not sure if my musical tastes have matured that much or whether the playing by the Quarneri Quartet on RCA is that good, but they have now convinced me that these Beethoven Quartets are pieces that I will return to regularly for enjoyment. The Shostakovich Quartets still speak to me on a more personal level, and I still struggle to figure out the middle Bartok Quartets. The Beethoven set by the Alban Berg Quartet on EMI 73606 has served as a great complement to the Quarneri performances, and I now I can highly recommend either one (better both) of these unbelievable bargains to those wanting to better appreciate the Beethoven String Quartets."
1,Does Not Work,This product does not work. Lights blink with every turn of the dial. I contacted Behringer but they have not reponsed yet.Too late to return to Amazon. I guess it is now a Fancy Door Stop.

5,captivating exploration of a multi-layered world and mindset,"REVIEWED: The Burden of IndigoWRITTEN BY: Gene O'NeillPUBLISHED: March, 2002This is a strangely beautiful story set in a dystopian society of an outcast's journey of hope and morality. I say "" strangely beautiful,"" because the protagonist is a convicted pedophile, yet the reader is drawn into empathizing and rooting for someone who, under most any other circumstances, would be found appalling and despicable. In this not-too-distant-future, criminals have their skin dyed according to the severity of their crimes and sent to live in the wilds, outside of society's protection. The book follows Gaetan (now known only as an Indigo Man) in his older years as he discovers that the dye on his skin may finally be beginning to fade, and he contemplates the life he once had and what a new future may bring. Powerful, poignant, and demonstrative, this book is a captivating exploration of a multi-layered world and mindset.Five out of Five stars"
4,elmo,"My son is happy to have it to watch but i wish i was paying attention and would have noticed that it was a down load video instead of the actual dvd,cause my son can only watch it in the living room instead of his room"
4,Good puppet shows,"We borrowed this DVD from the library two weeks ago and my 2.5 year old daughter wants to watch it every day. She really enjoys the puppet shows, such as the ""play"" that Sesame street characters put on about the ""first Christmas"" and when Elmo was dancing African dances, and the Jingle Bell song part. She watches it again and again. As an adult, I found these parts to be cute too, but I don't understand why they choose to spend so much time on Kwanzaa. If one tries to be international, what about the Asian holidays which are so obviously left out in this program?"
5,Well worth it!,"I bought this DVD approx. a month before Christmas for my almost 2 year old daughter. She watched the Elmo Happy Holidays DVD EVERY DAY and never got tired or bored of it. The DVD is entertaining, educational and fun to watch. It is a wonderful DVD for any child who loves Elmo and well worth the money."
5,Exceeds expectations,"This blew my mind! The performance from The Raconteurs is most certainly one of the very best I have ever seen. They are more raw, more ""rock n' roll"" than any of the albums even hint at. The performance of Blue Veins is one of the most soulful, emotional moments I have ever seen on a music dvd/blu-ray. And for the price, it may be the best value."
3,"I like the band, but would have preferred a better performance and recording.","My expectations were set by their last album Consolers of the Lonely, which is incredibly well-performed and meticulously recorded. I couldn't wait for a chance to see this group live, and was thrilled to be able to pre-order this DVD. In the studio, The Raconteurs are a mature, developed, cohesive unit... Even in the more chaotic moments, they never feel out of control.This DVD doesn't reflect the qualities I just described. The sound quality isn't terribly good, and the energy level detracts from the songs. I'm not prepared to say they were rushing the tempos, but that's how it felt to me, I can only say it came across as nervous energy to the extreme.I hope they do some more recording, and that we get to see another DVD. Even with these critiques, I would buy their next DVD sight unseen. I know they have incredible shows in them; in my opinion, this just wasn't one of them."
2,Audio Not Up to Par,"You have to love the band, because the production value is pretty low...and audio is highly compressed sounding. Not as good as most Bluray concerts."
5,Brilliant!,"This is such a fine concept book that one must ask why didn't anyone think of Cryptomania before. I learned a lot about my mother tongue, English, including a deeper appreciation of its roots. Illustrations are well conceived and witty. Highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes their child, grandchild (or theirself) to become a more informed user of our language."
5,Delighted to find,"This is an entertaining account of the life of Amariah Chandler, who was my great-great-great grandfather. I read the book because of this connection, and was a little surprised when I enjoyed it just because of the description of the times he lived in and the portrayal of this inspirational old character. The print, as advised by Amazon, was somewhat blurry, like actually reading a book printed in the 1800's, but for me that just added to the ambiance of the story. Annilaurel"
2,3M 1/2 Clear Heat Shrink Tubing 4 ft.,"The picture misleading, yes it says clear but thought I was getting black. The tubing came poorly packed, bent and folded up. When i attempted to use it applying to much heat was melting it. I had purchased black heat shrink and worked perfect. Like I said it says clear, but has a picture of black heat shrink. The material just looks and feels like junk, and being clear? Who wants to see the crappy soldering job you have done?"
4,A new theme with an even newer view point.,"A book about the Indians of the southwest is not a new theme, nor is feminism. Cougar Woman, however, is the surprising blend of the two. A tender yet powerful story of a little girl who showed an extraordinary aptitude for warfare and leadership and was allowed to not only train with the young males of the tribe but to eventually become their leader and an excellent role model. A must read for young girls, feminists, historians and lovers of Indian tales."
3,ok,"The materials are standard size, however the wheels and axels are not the BSA kit and do not qualify if your competition forbids aftermarket wheels and axels."
3,What I expected.,I got what I expected for a good price. good product. Would buy here again if the need arises. Very happy
5,"The Standard Deviants - Pre-Algebra, Part 2","I really disliked math in high school. It was a difficult subject to master. With this video, I can take it step by step. It is broken down for me to understand it. If I don't grasp it? Simple-I press rewind. Having the convenience of rewinding it until I grasp it. This DVD is a MUST for anyone having a hard time with algebra. I am more than pleased with my purchase."
1,Steer Clear of this Seller!,"Will never use Apex supplier again. Seller argumentative, refused refund when I hadn't received product in over a month! I'm now afraid to use any other seller than Amazon directly."
5,This product works great!!!,My child has sensitive skin and because of this product her skin is easy to maintain
1,Bad Acting,This movie was terrible. The acting and cheap sets came straight out of a seventies porn film but there were no sexy bits to distract from the lack of quality. I felt like I was watching a train wreck. At one point a line is edited together one word at a time with the girls head chopping round the screen every half a second.
2,Not what I expected,"Buyer Beware of this product, the stock photo has obviously been ""photoshopped"". Although the look of this mask is almost the same, it has a very dull colored appearance. Expect the horns not to look like that, they are sagging and folded.The muzzle is not that bright at all and the teeth have been exaggerated. None the less, it is still fun.Pros-Detail is alrightCons- Flimsy, trickery with photoshop (shame on them)Final note- the price of this should be $10.00 and no more."
2,"This CD isn't growing on you, that's a fungus.","I have always been a huge Faith Hill fan. I buy everything she releases, and have always been very happy (no, I don't just listen to Country Music). I bought this CD and was very disappointed the first time I listened to it. From reading the other reviews, they say it will grow on you as you listen. I'm willing to give it another shot, in fact I'm going to go dig it out of the trash right now. By the way, I let others listen to it also, and everyone hated it. Good luck Faith, but I guess every CD can't be a winner."
4,Great album!,"Let me start out by saying that I have enjoyed Faith Hill's music for the past few years. That being said, I do not believe that she has betrayed country music at all. In this CD, she has almost totally strayed from it. In fact, the only reason I did not give this CD 5 stars was because there not enough country songs on there. I would have enjoyed a really good country song or two. I do not really focus on the videos because the video is not the song, it's what is in her voice and her heart. I did not initially believe I would like this CD as much as I do, but I like every song on this CD. I recommend this CD to anyone (except those who feel she has ""betrayed"" them, of course). Sorry guys, but country music is not the only style out there."
3,Faith Hill an american idol?,"After only a few listen of the ""Cry"" album, something stroke me. Faith Hill interprets most of the 14 songs as if she was an american idol contender. The songs on that album are mostly ballads and when it rocks, it's the type of danceable pop à la Coyote Ugly which sounds already dated. I enjoyed only a few songs like the opener ""Back To You"" which is amazing and the first and title single ""Cry"". But if you like Celine Dion or all over-singing ""chanteuses"" try this album."
5,"Not for Faith Hill fans, obviously... BUT...","My wife is a big fan of Faith Hill's. I'm not a country fan at all. My wife bought this CD, and when I heard it, I fell in love with it on the FIRST SONG...""Free"".Obviously, Faith Hill fans are country fans, and this is no country CD. But in my mind, it is HOT! I even went back and listened to other Faith Hill CDs, and with just a couple of exceptions, I didn't like them...again, because they are country.The lyrics on ""Free"" are uplifting for anyone. Very positive message that we can accomplish far more than we give ourselves credit for. And ""Cry"" would be a hit on any of her CDs.Her finale on the CD (""You're Still Here"") struck a sentimental chord in my wife and me...we lost our 21-year-old son over four years ago, and, as the song suggests, he is still here. Very touching.Faith doesn't seem to have written any of the selections on this CD, so a big kudo to the songwriters.Great lyrics! Great music! Great artist!Keep CD's like this coming, Faith!!!"
3,"Good, but not as good as ""Faith"" and ""Breathe""","I love Faith, so I went out and bought this new CD on the day it was released. Although this CD is good, it is not as good as Faith Hill can be. ""Faith"" and ""Breathe"" are much better CDs. Nonetheless, her voice is as amazing as ever.If you are looking for country, this is not the CD for you. This is more of a contemporary adult/soft pop CD."
1,What a waste,"I was greatly dissapointed in the lack of any memorable tunes or lyrics. This is more pop than country, and bad pop at that. I really enjoy Faith Hill's voice and talents. Perhaps she needs a new producer."
2,So Dissapointing,"This is Faith's least impressive album. I have been a fan of hers since the beginning but am slowly losing interest. It includes a couple good songs such as ""When The Lights Go Down"" but the rest is empty pop music. This once great country singer is no more. I'm a fan of pop music too but this can't really compete in that arena either. I would not reccomend buying this album."
2,Definitely lacking...,"I believe that Faith Hill is talented; she has a decent voice, but she definitely works it to its fullest potential. Sadly, this album is terribly disappointing to me. I don't care if she crossed over to any and all genres, but these songs are very weak lyrically. In ""Cry,"" she sings about the ""pot of lies you gave to me.."" Hello? This sounds like a sixth-grader writing this song. Musically, it's a nice album; lyrically, it seems to need some serious help.Also, Faith Hill is a happily married, got-life-by-the-tail person; I have a hard time listening to her sing about being abandoned, lonely, and unhappy. It just doesn't fit with the image projected by her. I realize that she's like an actress, projecting her emotions into these sons, but it just doesn't work in this particular album."
5,SUPERB!...,"Fait Hill's ""Cry"" is just that....SUPERB!... She sing with so much soul. This is by far her best album, her voice matures and grows stronger with each passing one. I just love the song ""One"" It is so soulful. She makes you feel like you can relate somehow to her songs. Faith is right where she deserves to be...on top of the Country charts. You go girl!!!!!"
5,Love this CD,"I love this CD so much! I listen to it every morning when I get dressed and every night, its the thing that puts me to sleep. I listen to the first three songs mostly and they are beggining to skip because I listen to them so much!Sincerly,Cailtyn"
3,Terribly disappointing...,"I adore Faith Hill and I don't care if she's singing country or pop, but this CD is terrible to me. I would give it a two but I can't bring myself to do it. I love ""Cry"", and I was hoping that the rest of the CD would be as great, but when AOL previewed it off the welcome page, I couldn't even bring myself to listen to it fully. I think Faith is a very talented woman, but I really think that she should fire her producer for letting her do this album. Definately not her best."
2,what happened???,"...what happened??? okay we were all prepared that this was faith's ""cross-over"" album, but at best this is an average pop record. now that this is hopefully out of her system, let's hope she comes back to the country where she belongs !!!"
4,Changing but still the same...,"I love Faith Hill! This album is more 'pop' than Breathe. It's very soulful. You can feel what Faith was feeling when you listen to the songs. I like that's it's not really country, yet not rock & roll. She is sticking to what she said before...she just sings and tries to be herself. The enhanced portion of the cd is really cool. It lets you go behind the scenes of recording the album, photo shoots, etc. It also has the full length video for Cry. My faves are Cry & Stronger."
1,What is this anyway ?,"This is not a country album. It is not even good song selections. I've tried and tried to like it, being a Faith fan, but it just doesn't happen. This will be her biggest failure. It a mess of an album."
2,Very disappointing if you expect country,If you are looking for country this is not the CD for you. There was maybe one song that remotely sounded country. I was on a road trip and thought this CD would be a safe buy...I was wrong. I listen to most genres and I still wouldn't recommend this.
5,Awesome,"Forget all of those people saying that Faith has turned her back on Country music, this is an album about a woman doing exactly what she enjoys doing. This album showcases her talent and her amazing voice!!! Way to go Faith!"
4,"Not Country Music, but excellent just the same","I have to admit, that I had to listen to this CD several times before I decided that I liked it. After this ""adjustment period,"" I love it. To me, it has a mellow pop sound that is very relaxing. Faith's voice is as strong as ever and the lyrics are rich with meaning. My favorite songs are: Beautiful, If You're Gonna Fly Away, and You're Still Here. I would definitely recommend this CD."
2,Disappointing,"The best word to describe my reaction to this album was surprise. This is not the Faith Hill people are used to hearing. After two months of anticipation, I was excited to buy this, only to be quickly let down when I put it in my CD player. Faith showcases her beautiful voice, but the majority of songs are not typical Faith territory. There's a lot of pop and R&B influence on most of the tracks. Two or three tracks (Cry, and This is Me) actually sound (kind of) like country music. If current Faith fans are hoping the album is similar to her latest single ""Cry"", they will be let down. This CD should not be filed under ""Country"" in any store. If you like Celine Dion or the latest LeAnn Rimes, then you'll like this. Faith may feel like she grew and improved on this album, but she has undoubtedly alienated many of her most dedicated fans by ignoring her country influence. If you're a country fan, spend your money on Dixie Chicks' ""Home,"" not Faith's ""Cry."""
2,Murder on Music Row,"I'll start this by saying that Faith Hill does have in my opinion an incredible voice. That has never been a question. The problem I find with this album is that it is being marketed as counrty music, and I am hearing the singles on COUNTRY radio stations.Faith Hill is no longer country music, and hasn't been for a while. ""Cry"" her first single, was an okay, if cliche song, being thrown around as a country song. It is not, and her latest single, ""When The Lights Go Down"", is a good song, but again, NOT COUNTRY!!!Faith Hill needs to let go of country music, since she is no longer singing it. Let real country singers like Alan Jackson give us the image of what country music needs to be like. Faith is pop now, and she needs to realize it!"
1,I'M SO BORED I COULD CRY,"I'm sorry--this album is the worst. There is not one upbeat song. The emotional angst associated with Breathe was one thing, but Faith can't make a career out of negative emotional turmoil associated with every song.I have tried to like this CD, but in my book, it is a huge thumbs down.Pick up the pace, Faith."
1,Faith Hill and Shinia Twain are just not real country,"I respected Faith Hill when she came out with ""This Kiss"". It was a simple and melodic tune which you just couldn't help but like. At the point, she had a choice to become a respected singer who does tasteful music or to become a superficial so called country diva. She choose the later which is regretable.She had some potential and now she is just going to be another shallow, superficial ""pop-country"" singer. By the way, this is not country music. It is soft rock. That's it!"
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,Not nearly as good as 'Breathe'; this album sounds like she's trying too hard to branch out even further than before.
1,Disappointed,"Faith Hill was much better when she stuck to her roots. I found the album to be boring. ""Cry"" is mediocre at best. I expected something much better."
4,Cry - Go Ahead Faith,"I am buying this album shortly because I like ""Cry"" and the new soulful release ""When the Lights Go Down."" When I first heard ""Cry"" I thought it was Martina McBride b/c I am not used to Faith belting out her tunes like that. ""When The Lights Go Down"" gives a soulful performance and is a storyteller of people being down on their luck and to reflect and see what you are really made of.The Amazon.com editor Alanna Nash is clearly ""off her rocker"" and doesn't understand Faith Hill's career at all. Clearly, the writeup illustrates this and a number of fans will simply laugh at the writeup which exudes igonorance and lack of research. Go back to editing the Star and the Globe tabloids please.Faith's backlash in Nashville should be curtailed. As previously mentioned, Faith Hill has country roots and is simply evolving like any artist does... whether musician, ballet or martial.Way to go Faith and your fans are all behind you!Mario Maverick"
5,Faith - Unbelievable,"This is Faith Hill at her best so far. She rocks to 'Free' and 'One' woos you softly with 'When The Lights Go Down', breaks your heart with 'Cry' and continues to entertain with the rest of the songs on this album. Can she get any better? I don't see how but I'm sure she will. She is a consummate artist with this album."
4,Faith Hill Is BACK!!! Once Again... Not A COUNTRY Album.,"This is a follow up from her previous album BREATHE. This time, she surprize us with balled such as ONE, WHEN THE LIGHT GOES DOWN, BABY YOU BELONG, YOU'RE STILL HERE. Those are my fav from the album and I think she did great.There is a couple of filters as i don't think her rock song sound good such as FREE, THIS IS ME and BACK TO YOU. Though on this album, there's no country song and its pure pop rock music, it is a great album to keep as a collection to your Faith Hill CDs. BUY IT NOW and you won't regret it cuz there's a few more songs worth a listen to.In my opinion, ONE is the best song on the album. Its such a great Faith Hill ballad with her powerful vocal. Excellent!!!"
2,Listen to the original,"In all honesty, I'm not the biggest Faith Hill fan, but she does put out some good stuff. I have heard her version of the song ""Cry"". Unfortunately, I am a big Angie Aparo fan, and let's just say she doesn't quite match up. If you like the song ""Cry"" I HIGHLY recommend you listen to Angie's version of it on his CD ""The American"". You'll find that, like most things, the original is better."
2,"""Cry""? I cried laughing!","I only give Faith's latest c.d 2 stars because...It's pathetic! Don't get me wrong, Faith is an amazing singer and performer, but to be honest it's a little boring, The only good song would have to be ""Cry"" and ""When The Lights go Down."" The rest are so bad I cried my self to sleep laughing!If your truly looking for a good Faith c.d. I suggest you import ""There You'll Be: The Best Of."" Which features amazing songs such as; ""There You'll Be,"" ""Breath,"" "" This Kiss,"" and many other classic #1 hits! I hope this helped you in determining wheather or not to buy her new album, but don't take it from me. ""Cry"" already sold over 2 million albums, so go buy it and see for yourself!"
2,Faith HIll,I believe Faith Hill is a better artists than what is in this album. She has more talent and ability than this album shows. She should try not to be so pop orinated and just stick to singing songs where she can show off her beautiful voice.
