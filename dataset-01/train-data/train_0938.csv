1,do not buy.,"Wonderful poems completely overshadowed by annoying, self-important background music that sucks all joy from these poems. Leaves of Grass -- more like ""sounds like a$$"""
3,Be aware of what you're getting,"If you want a biography of Brecht to find out more about his life, not just his literary output, this is NOT the book for you. I finished it and realized I did not know much more about his life than I could have found out online, though I had been treated to quite a sampling of all of his works and some commentary, including extensive synopses.I consider the above the major flaw in the book. If it had been entitled ""The Writings of Bertolt Brecht"", I would have known what to expect, as that is really what this book is all about. If you want a biography about the man and his doings, you'll have to look elsewhere."
3,BERTOLT BRECHT BY EVEN IN SPANISH,"I am peruvian and I read the book in Spanish, thanks to a friend who bought it in Buenos Aires.I am a Bertolt Brecht's researching friend. This is the way I considered him: like a living one working for the theater.I found the book nearly excellent...but too much condescending at the ""human valorization"" of our beloved friend. Ewen looks throught his appreciations too much ""innocent"" in that respect.And I have a big question. Ewen says that Brecht ""got a Medicin degree"".I do not know if this are translation problems but it is the first time (and I search about living Brecht since 1968)I heard about it...."
5,Great Read For Anyone Getting Into This Great Hobby,I am not going to go into great detail as others have already done. This is a great book for anyone looking to learn more about and enter into setting up their own salt water aquarium. The book gets 5 stars because of its ability to get a beginer up to novice in one short book.
5,"Great book, lots of important information!","Great book, lots of important information! Answered a lot of questions we had about selecting fish for salt tank. Book was in great condition, seller shipped fast. Very happy."
4,An ok starter...,"This book was an ok starter book, but does not delve into great diagnostic detail. I had to purchase another booh for that."
3,First Step,"The title description of this book is way off. Please note - this is not the book you need if you really want to setup and maintain a marine aquarium. It is very basic and is worth looking at if you want to get a general idea about a maine aquarium. With that said, I really do like this little book. It is easy to find stuff in and does have a lot of useful information. Lots of good pictures and lots of good ideas, but really isn't all that you need to get going."
5,A great book for the first-time aquarist,"This book delivers on its promise. Without any experience whatsoever in aquariums, I got two great tanks up and running in three months with thriving fish. The greater up-front expense is more than compensated for by the ease of long-term maintenance as well as the health and well-being of the inhabitants. The only shortcoming in the text in my mind (but not worth a reduction in a star) is too little discussion of lighting given the many options, but you come to learn that lighting is a matter of personal aesthetic preference as well as what is in the tank, and there are online sites where you can compare the same tanks under different lights. The only other book I needed was Marine Fishes by Scott Michael, which allowed me to narrow in on species of interest once I had completed the initial choices outlined by Paletta, and know exactly what to feed them. Great text! Thanks!!"
4,A scuba diver review,"I found this book to be an excellent source for the beginner. It clearly lays out all the steps to properly plan and operate a salt water aquarium. I found it to be a very well written enjoyable to read book. As a diver, who wishes to recreate a reef in my living room, I felt it was a too brief on the selection, care and feeding of invertebrates. Even so,those who are interested in fish will find this to be an invaluable book."
5,Bringing it all together,"I bought this book, along with another, to research and get info on starting a tank. I have to say this is such a great book for anyone who is afraid to get started, like I was, in investing in a saltwater tank. After reading it, I am confident that I will be able to start up and maintain a nice tank in my home. I cant wait to get started! The book is very easy to follow. The pictures are great. Great checklists and tips. So far, it is the best book I have come across, for a beginner like myself. It made me feel, with a little thought and planning, that I could easily start up a nice tank. Thanks for such a great book!"
4,Very good book,"Very good book. We also purchased the ""Complete Idiot's Guide . . . "" which is much more helpful for a tank setup."
5,excellent,"i started a marine aquarium from scratch and with no knowledge. it was very confusing but without this book i don't know what i would have done. it covers all the basics, got me up and running and with no problems."
5,The New Marine Aquarium: Step by Step Setup & Stocking Guide,This is an easy to read and informative book on setting up your first marine aquarium. This is excellent for the beginner and could be used as a refresher or to answer a question for someone who already has a tank set up. Book progresses in a very logical order and explains why certain set ups are more beneficial than others.
4,Great for absolute learners,"It is a GREAT first read. I had been floating around gathering information about starting a reef tank for about two months when I aquired this one. I had learned a fair amount already and a lot of the information was duplicated as it is very ""beginner"" but I'm still glad to have it for reference. I would choose this book over all others to get a basic idea of the ""right"" way of starting your first marine aquarium. Too many of the books out there are outdated with impractial advice. Easy read, good pictures, not too time consuming."
5,Great guide for begginers....,"I'm planning on setting up a saltwater aquarium and with the myriad options in filtration, lighting, tank sizes, heaters etc. I became confused. This book is an excellent step-by-step guide to setting up an aquarium since it explains everything thoroughly with simple terms. I very much like the fact it endorses natural biological filtration (the so called ""Berlin method""). It has nice pictures and drawings.I'd say this should be a start point for anyone who's new in this hobby...although I recommend to buy as well some sort of encyclopedia on marine fish and/or invertebrates in order to get to know in depth the kinds of fish you want to host."
4,"Great book, focus on beginners!","I like the book, great advise. I don't give it 5 stars as it is an edition a couple of years old and is not up to date on the newest advances in filtering methods, but it is a must read for people that don't even have a tank yet and want to get in the hobby."
5,A must have resources for New Marine Aquarist,"This was the second book I've purchased as I was recommended by various hobbyist whom I have lots of respect for. When I started reading this book, first thing I told myself ""Wow, how little I knew"". I would highly recommend anybody who is getting started with Reef Hobby. This book shows step by step on how to setup your first aquarium. Even as little detail as how to setup the Live Rock, how can you create tunnel with PVC pipe, setup equipment chart and so on. I say, this is a must have book"
5,Essential Starter Book for Marine Aquarium,I would recommend this to anyone interested in starting a marine aquarium. The author provides a to the point and practical guide to setting up your first or next tank. You do not need a biology degree to enjoy it.
4,Terrific starter book,The writer did just as intended in this book. It is a starter book for someone starting a marine aquarium and it does that precisely without going into heavy details which would create a sense of doom for the new marine aquarium keeper. I spent years with my successful tank and I owe it largely to Michael who is also a sometimes writer for Marine Depot and other places.
3,out dated,I would have to say that this book is out dated and the info it does offer is very basic. would be ok for someone with just a passing interest in the hobby. But if you plan to set up a full reef I would look else were
1,Not very good at all,"I bought these strings based on other reviews and the endorsements.Once installed, they sounded as dead as the last strings I just removed. I usually buy GHS Boomers that are crisp and bright and ring true for months.I used Rotosounds on my Rickenbacker many years ago when there was little choice...but I'll never purchase these again."
1,Looks good -- poor performance,I found this headset to not measure up to my expectations. It frequently hangs up on calls. There's a huge lag for it to respond to the phone. Sound quality while on a call is mediocre. Support is poor/rude.
1,Does not work with Blackberry 7100g,"It is a great device, unfortunately, I did not work with my husband's 7100g. I tried it with my Treo and saw the same problem - it pairs with the phone, but does not transmit audio. I exchanged for a different unit and had the same problem. What a shame, the headset is extremely light and I can hardly feel it in my ear (I used it without the ear loop)"
1,Back to the drawing board,You cannot turn it off with the phone on-it just redials the last number. The plastic part that wraps to the ear and contains the mike was pathetically flimsy and broke after just a few uses. I super glued it for the so not a huge deal but it is indicative of the poor design for such a pricey piece. Light wieght but not particularly comfy. Overall poor button controls. I am looking for sonething different now. A total waste of money.
1,Dont buy it.,"This headset is over priced and suffers from poor sound quality. It looks good, has a cool charger and it is comfortable but it has very low volume and poor sound quality. If you want just looks, its great. If you want a good headset that you can hear good with in the car, its no good. Its just not loud enough for my taste. I sold mine within a week."
2,Not worth the money. I'm returning it.,"The biggest problem is that the outgoing sound quality is not great. At it's best, the person I'm talking to says I sound a bit muffled. At it's worst, there is static and I am barely comprehensible. Sometimes I hear static myself, even when the phone is a few feet away. And the range is not impressive, certainly not 30 feet.'This headset just isn't worth $100. There are superior wired headsets available for under $30."
3,Better than Moto H500 but just barely,Needs a boom to pick up your voice.People unable to hear you in loud noise environments.2 charging options. One via USB cable and a docking stand.Fits comfortable on ear.Buttons are easier to use than Moto H500.Probably not worth the additional $ for the Jabra
4,Works great iphone,"I have had this Jabra JX 10 for 2+ years. When I got my iphone, I could not hear very well with the handset, the Jabra makes listening much better. People can also hear me well. It has two flaws: the ear piece is fragile and you will need to call and order a few extra (10) at 99 cents each and then you have no problems. The ear piece breaks about once in 6 months. The other flaw is the charger, you must be gentle when connecting and disconnecting. These flaws are minuscule compared to its light weight and good sound quality. My son bought the Jabra JX 10 edition 2 and is not as pleased as the original version."
1,unhappy cusomer,"The first Jabra JX10 came defective and I had to pay over 12.00 to send it back to the Ace Photo. they would not send me a replacement until they received the defective one. Finally after nearly two weeks, a second Jabra JX10 arrived, also defective. Ace Photo refused to send a mailing label and said that I should contact Jabra. I then called Jabra and they said that they would send out another one immediately with my credit card on file along with a mailing label to return the defective one. It has been 4 days and I have not received the replacement. Jabra also informed me that the warranty started when the initial Jabra was sent out, which I think is unfair. It should begin when I receive a product that works. As you can see, I'm rather upset about this whole transaction. It makes me think it would have been better to purchase it at a local electronics store. This is the first time that this has happened, I have been satisfied in the past with other orders through Amazon."
1,painful,"Sharp corners on the back dig into my ear. Extremely painful. Ear hook breaks easily, both inside and at the tip. Wind noise is not controlled very well and the volume must always be adjusted. I suggest a Motorola product instead. They must have actually had someone try their units out before putting them on the market. Jabra was obviously more interested in how the unit looked and not how it performed."
1,Horrible Experience,When I recieved the item it was bad out of box. I called and it was some sort of four day company holliday so I left a message and e-mailed for an RMA with no results. After waiting over a week I called back and was given an RMA number and asked for a new unit to be sent. I was told that I needed to send back the bad unit (at my expense) and then they would send a new unit. Never recieved a new unit as promised but did get a credit. I think I'll buy from a different company next time.
2,It might be good.,Well I never got to use it; both times. it cost me about 30 bucks for returns twice. I didn't get to use it at all. I was disappointed on product. I would next time just buy it from store rather then from online.
3,"Good, but ...","The sound in bound and out bound is spotty; seems to be impacted by ambient noise. While this is my first wireless ear-piece, it was somewhat difficult to ""form"" to my ear [or I have a weird ear?]. I've had it less than two weeks and the ear piece has already broken ... seems a little funny for the price and reputation. Jabra must know this because they offer two replacements FREE on their web-site."
2,Terriable Mic and Range,"I should open this review by stating that I love the form factor, and the design. However, after using this headset for several days, there was one common thread that occured in each and every one of my phone conversations (I use a Moto V3C), no one could understand me, no matter how clearly I tried to talk. At first I thought it was just noisy, or windy, but in a perfectly quiet room with the phone in my pocket, people on the other end of my calls simply reported that I sounded garbled. I should say however that the reciever quality, from what I could tell was excellent and crystal clear, unless the phone was more than about 3 feet from the headset. If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset. My advise, pass on this thing."
1,A piece of junk,"I purchased this to replace an old Jabra that I used and liked. This model though broke within a day of when I purchased it. The ear piece just broke in two (which seems to be common, it broke as I picked it up). They offered replacements for free on their website, so two weeks later when they arrived, I put the replacement ear piece on, and then was disappointed with the range of the JX-10. If you have the JX-10 more then 12 - 15 inches from the phone, your call starts breaking up. I wear my phone on my belt, and in every call I receive static. Save your money and purchase a better headset."
1,Jabra does not have a repair service.,"Guess what? If you buy this product, you have one year to use it. Then when it breaks, throw it out! That's the official word from Jabra. Let me quote:Thank you for contacting Product Support.Jabra does not have a repair service. The only remedy we have for non functioning headsets is replacement, if the headset is within the one year warranty. We do require a copy of the receipt to be sent back with the product.-----Thus, when my headset stopped working and would no longer take a charge 16 months after purchase, my options were to (a) throw it out, or (b) throw it out.Caveat Emptor"
4,Very stylish Headset,"Very small and light headset that looks stylish and won't make you look like a geek. It fits well and is comfortable even after a long time due to it's lightness. Sound quality is good, noise and echo reduction work well."
2,"Sleek Look, Disappointing Performance","My cousin gave me her Jabra JX-10 to try; she knows I'm into gadgets. She wasn't having much luck with her unit and wanted confirmation that it wasn't her. She had challenges pairing it with her Treo 700, it didn't work, and that she was disappointed with the audio when she used it with her old phone.I went to work on it. At times I had trouble hearing the people on the other end and times they came in clear. The one thing that was consistant was that the people on the other end said I sounded garbled. Especially when I was in a noisy environment, such as my truck or the train.It's a cool looking device, but is inconsistant with its delivery."
2,"mediocre, esp given the high price.","so-so sound quality. high price, aaaaaaand it stopped working within 10 days of purchase. May have just been a bad unit, but I was tremendously underwhelmed."
2,Don't buy this Item from Amazon.com,"I bought this item based on all these reviews. Still waiting to see if I get the $30. off as promised from applying for the card. The headset did not work fully. Would not give ring tone, speaker crackled as if punctured, and that just the first 48 hours. Naturally, I went to Amazons return and exchange site.So Sorry, we don't exchange any Items you have purchased~~But Jabra will do it in 3 days; however you must pay to return it.I still believe in the product, just buy it somewhere with a honest defective return policy."
3,complaints about breaking up,"While I think the ergonomics are ok, the people on the other end of the conversation keep complaining that my voice breaks up. Maybe my office is noisy but I thought that would be compensated for in the circuitry."
3,Jabra - Not Bad,"This product has good sound quality. The earhook tends to come loose from the earpiece too easily, while you have to stronghold the earpiece to get it loose from the recharging cradle.The volume adjustments have easy access and I have had very few complaints about sound quailty."
4,Great Headset!,"This is the best of the 4 Bluetooth headsets I have owned (vs. Scala, Plantronics, Motorola). Sound quality, comfort and functionality of this headset are all superior to the others.My only gripe about this headset (and the only reason it does not receive 5 stars from me) is the extreme fragility of the earhook. Apparently it's a very common complaint about this model, because if you go to the Jabra website, owners of this headset can request replacement earhooks. They send 2 replacements free of charge.So if you can get past the price, this is the headset to buy!"
2,Ear Hooks,Don't buy this until they fix it. It works great until the fragile ear hook breaks. Then if just falls off your ear. It's impossible to get replacement hooks. I've traveled to over 20 different Verizon stores and you can't buy them separately. I have called Jabra tech support over 15 times in the last seven months to order new hooks from them and also filled out the form on their web site over 50 times and I have yet to receive one ear hook from them. Hope they start selling them soon.
2,Disappointing,"I actually liked this BT, but those I talk to don't. This thing picks up every bit of back ground noise. Bustling with paperwork comes across louder than my voice and prompts a ""Ahh! what is that!"" response from the person on the other end. Although it's light, it doesn't settle into my ear well. After about 20 minutes, it has to come out due to the sharp corner poking into my ear. I've broken two of the ear loops. Not really usable unless you're in a quite place."
2,Beware of ear-loop breakage,"The JX-10 works okay, looks cool, and is comfortable to wear, but you should expect the ear-loop to break every few weeks or so. It's a bad design with two very, very small pieces of plastic that hold the earloop in place. They are quite fragile and will break from normal use. A replacment loop costs under $10.00 so you might want to buy a few extra.This is a commonly reported complaint about the JX-10 and I would expect they'll have to do a redesign at some point."
4,pleasure and pain,"no doubt, the headset is lightweight and has great sound quality. dsp works reasonably, but not as good as the bt-800. you could forget you have it on if jabra had included eargels in their design. the pain from extended wear can make you cry.what the hell is the top buton for?the talk/end button is ok but the volume +/- buttons are definitely to small.the main thing is connectivity. it sucks that you need a tiny stylus to pair the device. once it is paired, it has great range and answers calls quickly.i have been a jabra fan since i was a telemarketer. now i'm a engineer. i have a black and a silver jx-10. i use bluespoon ax-2 eargels the extend the comfort. just slice the tail off and sand it silky smoothness. enjoy..."
1,Jabra jx-10,Buttons are samll and hard to find during operation and microphone does not pick up voices very well in outside areas.
2,Very Dissapointing,"I bought this item with high hopes after reading many positive reviews. I own a Treo 700w and this was my first bluetooth earpiece. I ended up returning it and purchasing the Plantronics Voyager 510.While the JX10 was comfortable and looked good, the sound quality was terrible. People on the other end could barely hear me, and there was loud static in the earpiece.Perhaps it is just the Treo 700w that the JX10 does not work well with, but for the price I expected better."
1,Get Laid,"I purchased this product with big expectations. The info on the vendor's page shows and offers ""new"" products. When the package delivered i saw a used, broken(earclip) and a non-working product. totally disappointed. i Sent a message to provider. Could not get an answer. I Will never purchase a product again."
2,Other people can't hear me.,I can hear people on it fine but have had nothing but complaints from friends. I can't use it.
2,"Nice unit, but died after 5 months","I purchased the JX-10 for my Palm Treo 680 and everything worked fine for the first 5 months, then one day it died. The was no audio coming through, I would just get a ""ba-lup"" sound when hanging up the line. The Jabra folks sent out 3 JX-10 units in row as replacement and all had the same problem (I even tried the replacements on a Moto Razor phone and got the same no audio problem). Strange thing is a Jabra BT150 unit works just fine. Jabra cannot say why it is happening, just that they've seen it on another case with Treo 680's & Razor's. Their only solution is to send me a new BT8010 unit. I agreed to it, but I think the BT8010 is a similar design as the BT150, which is very poor - it doesn't fit on your ear and constantly falls off. I'll see what happens..."
1,Jabra JX10 Earpiece Hurts Your Ear,Jabra JX10 earpiece hurts your ear:Pros: Lighweight & Sound QualityCons: Un-Comfortable Earpiece DesignI bought this becoz of its looks & light weight butI'm very disappointed as after using for an hour or soit started to hurt ear. The earpiece is veryun-comfortable.In my view its the design of earpiece is to blame. Ifthe earpiece was little smaller & fitted with softgel instead of hard rubbery material it would be justperfect bluetooth headset.I returned it to the store next day.
5,This headset is awesome!,"I wish I could say more about the Motorola headsets, but the truth is that we get a lot of complaints of static, and we have used several different models. Since we switched to the Jabra JX-10, we get NO complaints from customers. I can hear better with this blue tooth than any other I have used. It's a little pricey, but I think you get what you pay for! In our business, well worth the price."
2,"Great, except when there is background noise.","I love the size, form factor, and usability of this headset. Incoming sound is good. Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker. If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice. The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3). I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional. Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic. I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work. I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound."
5,"Love it, disliked the discomfort but Jabra came through","I bought this headset a few weeks ago and I loved it. Until I began to wear it. The lack of an eargel made it extremely uncomfortable to wear even though the sound quality was great. This is where the story takes a turn for the best. I contacted Jabra through the e-mail provided on the website, who send two replacement ear hooks to any owners of the JX-10. In the e-mail that I sent to them I mentioned that the unit was uncomfortable to wear by itself and that I would need eargels, which they sent, in droves. I have enough eargels for a while and I can now wear my headset without the ear hook, which is great since I wear glasses. Love the service I got from Jabra."
3,It was awesome ... until it died.,"I received my JX-10 on May 10th. Today, May 21st, it is dead. No light, no sound, no action. It is a sexy little beast, and I hope the replacement lasts longer than 11 days as it is very comfortable and plenty easy to hear with and actually works very well with the Treo 700P.RIP, little headset.As a follow up, I received a replacement and the replacement didn't die. It was a great headset, but due to my new job involving working in a server room, I needed one that had better noise cancellation.Since I can't update my star rating, I'd give it a 4 star rating now. If you want the ultimate headset, though, get the Jawbone."
1,Way too flimsy,"My wife and I each purchased one, about 2-3 weeks apart. By the time mine had arrived in the mail, hers had already broken and was being returned. Mine faired no better. With hers, the connection where you plug it into the charger pulled out of the earpiece when she disconnected the charger. Mine... first the ear loop broke in 2 pieces. Then, while pushing the button to answer a call, the whole unit crumbled into about 4 pieces in my hand. I wish I could give it back. The sound quality is crummy. The microphone picks up everything in the background much better than your voice. I am thoroughly dissatisfied!"
4,The must-have Bluetooth accessory for 2006,"This impossibly small (1.5-inch, 1/3 ounce) Bluetooth headset is the perfect compliment to slick phones such as the Razr V3. Jabra did a nice job not rushing it to market merely because of its irresistible size. You WILL forget you're wearing it; it's that comfortable. Great with sunglasses, too. It's loud enough for most environments (car windows down...NO). It sounds surprisingly good for both incoming and outgoing calls, although there's a faint hiss at all times that I don't get with the new Logitech Mobile Traveller headset. While sibilants were a bit exaggerated on the Jabra, it sounded clearer to people I called than some other headsets, with less of an ""underwater"" sound. You can charge it with the included stand, or directly from the charger (awesome), or directly via included USB cable from your computer. This Bluetooth 1.2 headset works with virtually any Bluetooth phone in both Handsfree and Headset profiles."
4,nice...,"i bought this one based on the buzz it created in europe before it was readily available here (US) around 1/06.dislikes: inbound calls have mediocre s/n and breakup at higher volume settings - especially needed outdoors. volume buttons hard to manipulate while in use. you have to steady your fingers near the mic (front)while doing this. i lost calls my first few days, by accidentaly hitting the off button.likes: style/looks, size, light weight, fits my ear the best. the mic. filters extraneous sounds (highway traffic, wind noise, etc) very well. it picks up calls quickly and my voice commands were easily understood - even with road noise - by my razr v3. it appears to be well engineered - so the guys behind it gave a lot of thought to trade-offs. it's probably the best currently(whatever that means). test drive before you buy, if you can."
3,Sounds Great - Loose Fit,"I have used several Motorola BT headsets and been pretty pleased with them (until I lost them or they went through the wash!) I decided to try something different this time, and after reading several reviews bought the JX-10. I am not disappointed with the sound but there are a few drawbacks. First, the fit to my ear isn't great. It ends up getting pulled away from my ear pretty easily. The manual isn't much help when it comes to adjusting fit. All it says is ""wear it how you like it.""The other thing is the stand is pretty much a waste. It is really tricky getting the earpiece onto the stand.If I had paid the original $180, I would be pretty disappointed in the headset. At less than $100, it's not so bad."
2,"Excellent device, defective ear hook","The unit is everything it claims-small, nice-looking, easy to pair and use, excellent voice clarity (away from other noise).The problem is the defective ear hook that fell apart (literally) after 2 months of use. I would rate the device as 5-star, but I can't understand why Jabra would enclose an ear hook that a dollar store wouldn't carry. I wouldn't expect much better on a $25 device, but I have higher standards for a $100 one.Jabra customer service was supposed to send two free ear hooks, but after 2 weeks, it hasn't arrived yet - which makes me suspect about their customer service as well.I guess the Danes have softer ears than we have in the USA."
5,Very good,I like this product very much. It's the best of all I have tried so far. It's small form factor is very convinient to wear all the time. It's quality is very good.
1,Reboot city,Did not work with my Treo650. Caused a constant reboot on my phone. No changes with the configuration would help.
2,not much better than cheaper Bluetooth headsets,"Recently bought the JX10 expecting the echo cancelation capabilities and purported superior fidelity would solve the problem of callers on the other end of my calls complaining that ""it sounds like you're calling from a wind tunnel"". However, after using the JX10 for 3 weeks now, I can say that everyone still complains just the same...Note that I am using the JX10 while in my (very quiet) office, not while driving with my windows rolled down or some other difficult environment.Basically, I wouldn't waste the money."
5,A process I can trust to work.,The author knows how to present a spiritual process that most anyone can practice to make life simpler.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK SHOULD BE BURNED. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT IS NOTHING BUT LIES-BUY DELORES KENNEDY'S BOOK ON MR HEIRENS INSTEAD. YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!! THIS BOOK DESERVES NO STARS, BUT I HAD TO GIVE AT LEAST ONE."
1,A typical surgeon: everything but surgery is beneath him.,"This author's bitter portrayal of everything medical save surgery is a bit irritating. As a current 4th year medical student this book reminded me of most people at the end of their clinical rotations: irritated by everything. His rantings are repetitive, tiring, and uncreative."
3,not to good,"I was expecting to receive all the colors shown in the ad. But, for some reason, it came only in one color. It should be told in the description of the product. The draw shows Black, White, Shell,Confetti and Marble colors.Planet Waves 10 WOODSTOCK Guitar Picks Assorted - Medium"
1,"Don't buy these, they let off a stink","The price was great, I bought 3 packs of 100 each for a mere $6.62 each. GREAT PRICE - but they let off a bad plastic smell when you use them. Some plastic smells smell weirdly good, but this is a weirdly bad smell that catches your nose even from a standing playing position and lingers on your fingers. If you buy them, toss them to the audience."
2,I am Picky About Picks,"I use Wegens, Blue Chips, Star Picks and I hoped this pick would be an inexpensive alternative. No so. I have to type at least 18 words for this review to be complete so this completes my review"
1,plastic below parr,This pick's materials just do not work for me. The sound with this pick seemed muted rather than snappy. Not close the comparable 351 pick we all have tried.
4,like it,I don't know what else to say it. I just love it. recommend it to anyone who like good things. Love music
4,Nice..............,Works as you would expect. Just the right amount of flex.Try some they are cheap enough not to break the bank.
3,not as PICK-tured...,"Well I expected 10 Standard in ""multi-color"" to be a mixture of different colored picks, as pictured.However what I got was 10 picks, all the same in the ""multi-color"" format.That's the one that's a mixture of red/white/blue at about the 11:00/12:00 position in the picture.Soooooooo, you won't get a mixture of picks as it is pictured, though the guitar picks themselves work just fine...you'll get 10 of the single ""multi-color"" design.If I had known that, I probably wouldn't have ordered them.But as I said, they work just fine for the guitar..."
1,Handle for Bathroom/Bathtub Exit,"This shower safety grip suction bar is by far the worst product I have ever purchased online. It is particularly horrifying to imagine the consequences of what could later happen when the suction cups repeatedly fell off after attachment to my bathroom walls (usually 12 to 24 hours later). Almost definitely, a person could be seriously hurt when climbing out of the tub. The grip handle did not stay attached to any of my walls, such as marble, glass, plaster or tile. Not only did I waste $24.00, I feel I was falsely misled by the misleading advertising claims of this product. I hope no one finds out the hard way this product is worthless."
2,It does not last long.,The one I bought break at the neck of one of the two connectors after using it for about 15 times.
1,Piece of junk/return policy lies.,"This product does not work. I followed instructions and it only stuck to tile for a few minutes then popped off. When I e-mailed the company and told them I felt this product was defective and wanted my shipping return reimbursed, they said no. They said just because the product won't work does not mean it's defective so I would have to pay for shipping. It also took over a week and 2 e-mails to get a reply. When you e-mail you get an automated e-mail back saying someone will be in touch within 24hrs. I would not advise anyone to purchase this product. I had ideal conditiond, large tile and tried to mount it at every possible angle."
1,Disappointed,"Product is a big disappointment. I purchased 3 of these handles. I have an elderly mother living with me and thought these would be perfect. She does not need the support, just the security that something is there for her. They are not. I put one on the shower wall but the tiles were small and the grout lines did not enable the suction to hold. I put one on the side of a large upright Freezer near a doorway. The suction did not hold after a day or so we found it laying on the floor. The third one fell off by itself from the clean dry glass shower door that no one ever used. I would recommend saving your money or spending it on something else!"
1,What a waste,"I purchased this item for using on my gardentub as I slip a bit. This is more dangerous than having nothing at all. My tub is smooth, so that's not it. It just doesn't stay secure. I went to get up and it was loose so I fell out of the tub. Good thing I didn't get hurt. I've even tried it on the shower wall, same thing, doesn't stay secure. We heard it fall off the wall in the middle of the night. Don't waste your money."
3,Safety Grip,Makes safety in the bathroom more secure. I don't feel so vulnerable getting in and out of the tub and off the toilet. My house is not handicap accessible.
1,Not worth it,"After repeatedly readjusting the suction, I finally left this thing off before someone had an accident. The 17 inch Saf-er product did work as stated so buy it instead."
1,"""Get a grip"" should get a grip!","Trash. I tried it on diffrent surfaces. it wont stay up for more than a few minutes. anyone who uses it for safety purposes is going to end up on a gurney. I am going to try to return it, if I can not I am going to destroy it before putting it in the trash. I dont want anyone getting ahold of it and getting hurt."
3,Good for a temporary solution,This device works on the suction cup principal. So if you don't have a smooth glass like surface to use it against this will not work for you.
5,Works Well,Delivered on time works at advertised. Was easy to attached to the smooth surface of the shower. I purchased two and I am very pleased.
1,Disappointing product!,"I purchased this for use on Fiberglass shower for use after total knee replacement surgery. My shower already is handicap accessible and has a built in seat and support handles built in. However, I wanted an additional support handle at the edge of the door to aid when exiting the shower.I installed this a week prior to surgery and was pleased to see the green/red indicator that shows if it is properly attached. We used our shower normally and every day I checked its status. Every day the top indicator would be red. We would reattach per instructions and have two green indicatorrs. By the next day the top indicator would be red again. I never trusted this item and we eventually threw it out after not being able to depend on it at all."
5,Great,"I bought 3 grip handles for my mother in law. They worked very well. Appears to grip very sturdily. I am keeping them for my husband and I when we need them. thank you,"
4,As advertised...,"The hand grip works very well, but after two years, the blue locking levers broke off. But for the price, two years is not too bad. It works very well for placing and removing sunroom windows as the seasons change."
4,shower safety grip,Very convenient for use in guest bathroom and especially for traveling. Is especially helpful for seniors when using the shower.
4,David White Torpedo Laser Level Kit,"While not top of the line due to price, this product is well worth the money and is solid. The tripod is amazingly sturdy and works great! The self-leveling is also good. Highly recommend for beginners and general use."
4,Simpons Puzzle,"The puzzle is a lot of fun, but very hard. When I saw it I thought it would be easy, but its not at all. The different people make it so difficult to place the pieces where they are supposed to go. I did find it a lot of fun, but it took a long time."
3,A Solid Effort!,"The dust cover claims this book is worth its weight in gold. Its last chapter, which outlines the 20 steps to earning $100,000 a year, could well make it so. If you buy the book, read the final chapter first. D.A. Benton’s 20 steps are clear and easy to follow. Once you know them, the rest of the book provides excellent supporting information. Benton shows examples of how specific individuals (many of them high-profile celebrities and athletes) used each step to achieve success. This book offers no get-rich-quick schemes. The author advocates a logical, methodical approach to making $100,000 per year. She is so confident that she makes a guarantee: If you put maximum effort into all 20 steps, you will become a member of the $100,000 Club. We [...] recommend this book to anyone interested in making a six-figure income."
2,A horrible read,This is a collection of horror stories by Paul Melniczek.UsuallyI love horror stories yet these stories were boring.The only one I liked was called Stick Men.While visiting his Uncle Fred on his farm.Bobby asks him how he gets all the worked done on the big farm .He tells Bobby about the Stick Men and howthey come out at night and do the work he could'nt.The onlything they ask in return is that he keeps them a secret.Yetnow Bobby knows and he can't keep a secret.Now the Stick Menare seeking revenge against Bobby and Uncle Fred. I guess some secrets are best never told... Just ask Bobby.
5,Gift,"I completed the series for my boyfriend for his birthday, he was very very happy. Hopefully we can sit down and watch all of them sometime."
4,Seinfeld gift set,"I purchased this gift set as a Christmas gift for a friend. She was thrilled, and thought the miniature puffy shirt was a hoot!"
5,WOW...,HOLY CRAP. YOU GET A PUFFY SHIRT WITH THE GIFT SET. NOW THAT IS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. WORTH MORE THAN THE $77 THEY'RE ASKING. I CAN'T WAIT...
5,Excellent Italian Cocoa,"Pernigotti Cocoa, is one of the best type of Cocoa for hot Chocolate and or baking. Much better than the chemicals one buys marketed as Cocoa here in the United States."
5,Getting another batch,"Received first batch last year. Smell? We all thought we'd died and gone to heaven. Wow. Definitely our favored cocoa. Now that the first batch is used up, am ordering another. Really, really good stuff."
5,Truly excellent,"The best cocoa I have ever had, bar none. Even paying a premium, you will be impressed as to how good it tastes."
5,OMG My chocolate recipes will never be the same!!!,"I couldn't wait to receive my shipment of Pernigotti Cocoa and it was at my door in no time. My first recipe was chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting. The cupcakes were a much darker brown than when I used my usual cocoa and the flavor was deeper, richer, and more robust (sounds like I'm talking about wine, doesn't it?). But seriously, this chocolate is pretty fantastic. It's the ultimate chocolate for chocolate lovers."
4,Freshness questioned,"Pernigotti Cocoa is certainly heads and above any cocoa product you find on your friendly grocer shelf. I just did not feelthat it was as fresh as the product I had purchased from Williams Sonoma. I am basically using it in baking, and have nocomplaints with the finished product. It did come packed in a very heavy plastic bag, and that might have been part of the problem."
3,NOT for ice cream,"I'm here looking for a Dutch process cocoa because I want it for ice cream. Was considering this one until I saw it was lightly 'dutched'. The problem with regular cocoa and, I assume this as well, is the oils from the cocoa remain in the powder. When you try to make ice cream, the oils cause the cocoa to 'pill' leaving specks of chocolate globules in the ice cream. Tastes OK, just doesn't present well. The search continues."
1,not too good!,this cd sucks! the sound effects are good but the music ruins it! i'd reomd bying chilling thrilling sounds of the haunted house it has better stuff! don't get this cd it's a waste of money whic i found out the hard way!
1,"Not scary, but frighteningly annoying!","The sounds are so bad they're almost funny. Hard to describe even what a lot of the sounds are--some childish laughing that sounds more like an elf than anything evil; the same repetitive cat scream over & over again (as if cats were scary), a little creaking here & there, & the whole thing rather poorly recorded (like maybe with an old microphone--nothing digital, poor editing, etc.). A much better choice (and once we've gone with for years to sync with a light show) is 13 Transylvania Ave."
4,"Great Color, Okay Texture","This is a fantastic color for those looking for a warm-ish neutral polish. I bought it after seeing a latte-colored polish on someone else and not being able to find it anywhere. This is more of a light muddy gray or gray cream than a beige/tan. It looks a little washed out on toes, but it's subtle and chic on fingernails.The only drawback is the texture. This polish is thicker than normal and cracks easily. I have medium length nails and within a couple days, the polish on the tips is cracked and lined from the nails bending. I generally end up re-doing one or two nails a day to correct cracks and chips. That hasn't been a problem with other OPI colors.I'd still recommend this polish because ""just right"" neutrals are so hard to find for some reason. I've worn this one three or four times and I like it a little bit more every time I wear it."
2,not what expected,During my search for (calling all goddesses) the new color (Did you hear about Van Gogh) yielded in the results. I knew the CAG color was likely retired so perhaps this was a new similiar color OPI had released. From the pictures shown one would think this is the case. It appears almost white/pearl. I was very disappointed when I received the polish as it was more of a beige/taupe/mushroom.
5,"these people aren't lying, it really does work!","i've only tried 7 up and coke so far, but it fits perfect. after u snap it in and cover it, u can pump the top to the point where u can squeeze the can and it will actually be more pressured than before it was open. when u actually pop it open, it is so tight u hear a loud pop from all the air being trapped inside."
5,Excellent Collection of Wordsworth Poetry,"In this edition, works of wordsworth are ordered in the chronological order of their composition. The book consists of an introduction to Wordsworth life and poetry, his famous poems, the 1805 version of the prelude, and prefaces to the lyrical ballads and some letters on poetry. Minimal notes are given to help the reading. Overall it is a clear and compact edition which is suitble to admirers of Wordsworth poetry, and to scholars of his works who are interested in his poetic development."
5,great for our 3 year old,"we have been very pleased with this program. As others have stated, it can be repetitive for adults, but my 3 year old will play Phonics Quest for as long as you let her. She thinks that it is hilarious that the ""items"", once collected, fly back out the door again, making her play more. While I am certain that the amount of reading that her father and I have done with her has helped her in learning to read, I honestly feel like Phonics Quest has advanced her reading further than she would have otherwise been. I feel I must address another reviewer's complaint that her 4 year old was able to guess the correct answer based on the first letter and the picture. My child figured this out as well, but the game ""caught on"", and started only supplying her with words that started with the same letter as the picture. All in all, I have been pleased with this game and would recommend it to a friend."
1,I had such high hopes....,"I bought this title yesterday. My 4 year old son loved the graphics and the games, but - as others have said before me - they go on for wayyyy to long. He was answering them correctly, but more questions just kept coming. He lost patience after the 10th question in a row, and moved on to another activity only to find the same thing.As a parent, I was disappointed in the ""phonics"" of the program. I am teaching my son to read at home, and he is sounding out words very well. This program doesn't teach you how to sounds out words, it just asked you to identify the words with the pictures. For example, my son would see the word TABLE and just sounds the first letter and guess that the picture of the table went with the word. Now, he was correct, but this didn't really teach him anything but how to be a good guesser. Even if he liked this program, I would not want him to use it because it doesn't teach him the ""phonics"" building blocks to really be a good reader."
5,Delightful,"The Book of Tolan begins with Murphy Patrick Tolan in 1779 with the potato famine. The stories go between the Irish/Scottish family and the English family. This delightful tale gives you such stories as transporting money in coffins, while the dead decay on top, to keep from being robbed, to brewing the strongest beer in Britain that could kill you and many many more that will keep you reading and laughing out loud. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read and loves to laugh. I won this book from Goodreads and I am proud to say that I also won book 2 Easy Come Easy Go and I can't wait for it to come in so I can start reading. Would be awesome if I can win book 3 also."
5,Had me reading with a brogue!,"What a gift for storytelling he has! With the catchy turn of phrase and wonderfully interesting tales, I felt like I was there peeping in on the goings-on. Lovely."
5,Riveting!,Wow! A Great Read. It kept me glued to each and every page for two days. I can't wait for Vol.2 and I hope to see its debut on the Big Screen sometime very soon! hint!
5,Great book/Great condition,"Started reading this book and couldn't stop! Great ideas for the classroom. I have already used many of the recommended text, as well as, the samples in the back of the book."
5,Great for teaching Writing,This is one of the best books I've seen for helping teach students to be better writers. It gives short minilessons that can give ideas and teach writing techniques with examples. I love it. I wouldn't teach writing without it
3,Lesson ideas are too rigid,"The idea behind this book is fantastic--to divide different aspects of writing based on grade level and specific writing skills, and provide helpful (and they are helpful to some degree) tips on how to teach students about these skills. A plus to the book is the logical progression from one lesson to the next.For me, the downside of this book is its rigidity. Unless you want to incorporate their suggested readings into your classroom as well, I suggest you buy a book describing different writing skills in general. As a Spanish teacher, I read this book with the hope of incorporating their ideas into my own classroom, but I found that the lessons were so closely tied to their own recommended story or poem that there was no way of adapting them."
4,step by step for the nervous teacher,"Although I don't believe writing, or the teaching of writing should be formula this book has proven to be a great resources for new teachers. I do a lot of staff development in writing and the teaching of writing and found this books to be honest in it's goals while using literature as a base for modeled writing. If you are wondering where to start or trying to find another way to teach the same old thing I am sure there will be a grade level appropriate idea here."
5,For all writers everywhere,Ralph Fletcher is my mentor as I teach all aspects of writing to my students. Wonderful mini-lessons and writing strategies are backed up by sound pedagogy and research. A must have book!
5,The water tastes great at all times,"I bought these for Christmas gifts for my loved ones because I don't want their getting harsh chemicals leaching from their plastic water bottles. I couldn't wait to use mine, however. I usually work out and carry water with me all the time. I can fill the bottle with ice and water if I want it immediately cold. I can fill the bottle and lay it in the refrigerator so it's ready to go when I am. I can even leave the bottle with the water inside in the hot car for days and the water's taste never changes. I may get another one to carry my iced tea. I use to freeze my iced tea in plastic bottles for use on the sailboat until I heard that's about the worst thing you can do to your plastic drinking bottles. I just hope my gift recipients like the Kanteen as much as I do."
1,"I want a ""safe"" bottle, not one made in China","With all the recent coverage on how China does not regard our safety in the least, I find it incredible that a product designed to keep us away from plastics and ""safe"" is made in China.I'm getting a SIGG bottle. I will not support a country that could care less if my kids are safe or not!"
5,JUST what I was looking for,"I wanted the clean taste and easy care of stainless steel with the shape and features of a sports water bottle (not a stainless travel mug) ... and THIS product hit the mark. I've had several travel mugs (one stainless) that leaked badly when knocked over, so I was looking for something with a secure lid that was easy to drink from and carried enough volume to not force me to refill it every half hour. I'm totally happy with the Klean Kanteen 27oz with black sports cap ... it's JUST right. And the service from this vendor was very acceptable."
5,Kleen Kanteen with Sports Cap,This is a great Eco-Friendly water bottle alternative. I gave them as gifts and they were well used by all (ages 4-70). I am going to order 2 more for friends who saw them and requested them.
2,KLEAN KANTEEN 27 OZ WITH SPORTS CAP,"I LIKE THIS ITEM, BUT SWEATS WITH COLD WATER, ALSO DOESNT KEEP WATER VERY COLD..BUT IF YOU JUST WANT WATER IN STAINLESS STEEL INSTEAD OF PLASTIC ITS A GREAT OPTION."
4,A good artist to listen to.,"I've listened to this CD before, and I liked this CD. My mother also has listened to this CD too, we both enjoy listening to it Pam Thum is a really talented artist."
3,"Great ideas, poorly written","The authors are good and genuine, highly spiritual people. But they are not writers. This book badly needs a skilled editor."
2,Super Skin Lightener Gel By Oleda,"This gel was not as great as I thought. I recieved 2 bottles of 2oz Oleda super skin lightener gel for over 30 bucks which is not alot of product for the cost. I give the product 2 stars because the shipment was fast and the product is oil free, but it is brown in color, it leaves brown spots on your skin. It is very liquid in substance. Even though the liquid product goes far, the lightening effects were not super in my experience."
1,Didnt work,This product didn't help me at all. It is expensive and is not effective. I purchase two of them and didn't notice any difference at all. The product consistency also is not good. Doesn't look like a gel but water.
1,NOT PLEASED AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"NOT PLEASED AT ALL! THIS PRODUCT IS VERY WATERY, DOES NOT WORK. I AM VERY DISATISFIED AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE IT AGAIN I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. MY DAUGHTER USED THE PRODUCT AND WAS ALSO UNHAPPY. A GOOD PRODUCT TO USE IS XTREME BRITE!"
3,Not the best,"This book is ok, but the stories are way too short, only 2 pages each, and the pictures are kind of cheesy. Nothing wrong with it, but Zondervan's toddler bible story book is better."
2,A sad disappointment,"I was disappointed with this performance and the production. Too often, the camera gives us odd shots of the audience and the pit, which doesn't help draw you into the story. Alagna can certainly act here, but his forced, high notes always go way sharp. His Nedda, Svetla Vassileva, also gives it her best, but keeps sounding squally and strident. The best of the lot is the Tonio of baritone Alberto Mastromarino - both good acting and voice. The sets and staging are befitting a standard college production. Sound and visuals are fine, but I'd stick to the Domingo DVD for a hair-raising show."
1,So dull!,"There are books which are a pleasure to read page-by-page. There are books which sweep me along to an inevitable conclusion: some conclusions are more satisfying than others. Then there are books which I just persevere with because *surely* something interesting will eventually happen.The Alien Years plot synopsis:The Aliens arrive (we don't know why)... and then, some several hundred pages later, they leave (for some equally unknown reason).What a bore! Lifeless stereotypical characters struggling fruitlessly. Maybe it's supposed to be a metaphor for something. I don't care one way or the other.Thank goodness I borrowed this book from the library and so I didn't waste any money--only the many precious hours of my life when I could have been reading something interesting."
3,Invasion story purely from the human point of view.,"I bought this book in the UK. On the plus side, this book contains quite a few realistic characters of the type you meet in real life (if you live in California that is). On the down side, the alien invaders are totally incomprehensible and the motivations of their actions are left completely unknown. This concept leads to an unsatisfying conclusion."
3,Get to the payoff already,"The First Silverburg I have read in years, like all his others it is1. Slow in the beginning2. Great in the middle3. so-so endingThe main characters which basically follows a family of soldiers through alien occupation for 60 years. They all do their best to resist the aliens who seem to care nothing for humans but most of what they do is completely pointless and useless.Still it is a nice little moral tale about the endurance of the human spirit in times of adversity. This is also true of most Silverburg stories."
2,"I'm sorry, but The Alien Years is a big disappointment.","The Alien Years started out with very little energy and ended in similar fashion. The aliens themselves were too cliche and Silverberg poorly supports the aliens' role as the antagonists. He simply writes them off as beings that are too intelligent for us to have any notions of who-what-when-where-why they are. Throughout the book, humans suffer and struggle in the hands of these so called ""Entities"" and never win any battles with them... not ever. The idea of such God-like, highly intelligent, and invincible aliens..well... SUCKS! The Alien Years is NOT action-packed nor is it thought provoking. My experience with this book is analogous to watching television for long hours... in the end I walked away from it with indifference."
3,Ultimately disappointing.,"I read part of this story in David Hartwell's excellent ""Year's Best Sci-Fi 3"" and was anxious to get my hands on the full novel...and for the first 400 or so pages, I was thorougly enjoying the book. First of all, as an alien invasion novel, it's got a sense of scope. Unlike such films as ID4, the alien menance lurks around for years as humanity struggles to overcome it. Secondly, the aliens are just that--alien. At no point does Silverburg try to humanize them or have us understand why they are they way they are.But where the book fails is having an unsatisfying resolution that made me literally want to throw the book across the room in disguist. Silverburg must not have known what to do in order to end the novel and gone to a standard cliche type ending. I won't say what the end is here, for the sake of those who want to be unspoiled. Just prepare for a disappointment..."
1,Can't finish... too boring,"I am up to page 160 and can't motivate myself to finish. I was very surprised that the book is this bad. I read other books by Silverberg which were very good and I had big hopes for this one.Oh well, can't win them all. NEXT!"
3,"Silverberg's knock-off of ""Independence Day""","My impression reading the book is that Silverberg wrote it after after seeing the hit movie Independence Day, and wanted a more substantive alternative. Both begin with takeover's of Earth by extremely powerful alien invasions. However in Silverberg's version the humans aren't able to immediately fight them off. Furthermore the aliens motives remain truely alien and incomprehensible. They neither completely control humanity nor leave it completely alone. And this makes the novel somewhat confusing as to what is the main plot as it meanders along. It sort of loses steam like one of those endless TV scifi series where there is no clear overall resolution- just a bunch of smaller stories."
1,"Please god, let somthing happen !","This book plotted a long arc in my living room before landing in the kitchen. The reason for this was because I reached the end of the novell and ,not suprisingly, there was no real ending. It took a lot of energy to end this one. Generation after generation of boring heros , I lost track of the family line somewhere near the middle. The characters drift from one event to another, never really taking an active part in what happens to them. Stay clear of this title."
2,No payoff for the time spent reading this book,"Many of the reviewers have said it better than I can.Good premise with no payoff. I slogged through pages of character development to get to a anti-climatic ending. It's one of those books that has you flipping back over the last few pages saying ""that's it""?I could understand that type of ending (Although many of the reviewers have revealed the ending I won't do that here) ifthe whole novel hadn't spent most of the time implying that the humans were going to kick the alien's rear.Waste of time."
2,"Not a bad read, but not good Silverberg","I read it straight through anticipating a boffo ending. But I was very disappointed. Characters seem to be pretty standard sci-fi stock types. Like others have mentioned here, I think it is pretty lazy to take two really terrific short stories (""Against Babylon"" and ""The Pardoner's Tale"") and recycle them into a novel. The added text diluted the stories' impact and added nothing. Not bad if you're looking for a beach read, but I expected so much more from Robert Silverberg. I think I'll go reread ""Lord Valentine's Castle."""
1,silverbergs worst,"a bad concept-aliens invade earth cause many hardships and death never communicate with us and then leave 50 years later for no reason-poorly executed. Books like this give sf a bad name inexcusable from one of the masters of genre. Deserving of 0 stars, utter garbage."
1,The worst book I have ever read!!,"I had hoped after reading the jacket that Silverberg would conjure up a compelling story, (after all he did write NIGHTFALL with Asimov)but he left me completely unsatisfied. I can't believe that he's considered a master of storytelling. He certainly pales in comparison to Asimov, Bear, Brin, Clarke, Nivin and Pournelle, the truly great masters of science fiction. I'll never read another Silverberg unless his name is preceeded by one of the afore mentioned masters."
5,Feel Good color!,"What a summer color! This is a happy, feel-good shade that I might rock all July! You want bold, you got it! I bought this one for a friend too, because I loved it so much :)"
5,Favorite Color,I have used this color for my toes for a long time. I ALWAYS get compliments. It is great for both summer or winter. It goes with everything.
3,Cajun Shrimp Opi,"Its a good color. I thought it was going to be more red than it is, it has this orange tint to it. Also should use two coats. But it is still a nice color."
3,Horrible subs,"I really wanted to watch this as I am a fan of Tsumabuki Satoshi and was intrigued by the Japanese/Korean collaboration. I understand Korean but the English subs were so bad and so distracting, it made it unwatchable for me. Maybe if I had figured out a way to turn off the awful subs I could have been more involved in the story. The acting seemed fine though so I gave it an okay rating. Just get rid of the terrible terrible subs so more people can enjoy this."
1,Horrible Translation,It was so bad i had to stop the movie 2/3 through it. I could only guess what was going on...
2,Pretty junky.,"Pros:- Character customization is great. I'm a sucker for job systems.Cons:- The characters are the worst characters out of any creative work ever made. Seriously, they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I was literally cringing during almost every cutscene.- The plot is utter trash. It's just a really dumb and basic story.- The battles are way, way, way too easy.- The achievements attached to the game are ridiculous.I'm glad I got this for an incredibly cheap price, because I would feel very ripped off otherwise."
3,If you like NES RPGs here is a great one for you,"I began Blue Dragon with great hopes. Stunning visuals, 'new game play', lots of fun. The game looks wonderful, however after about disc 2 (there are four I believe, maybe three) you just stop caring. I found the grinding to be a bit on the heavy side (I beat the final boss fight without him going though, so maybe too high.) The characters have been cut from other JRPGS (and if you don't know what the J is for don't play this game, you will want to set it on fire.) Some interesting mini-games in it. THe monster fight mechanic is interesting, however it does get old after a while. The achievements for the 360 are horrid. Read online and the suggestion is to put your controlled down on the ground and allow it to fight the monsters without you there and you will level up. I do not recommend the game, but I look forward to some of their other games as this is a strong start to a good series of games."
2,Blah,This game was touted as a throw back to the old days of RPG's. But basically you just watch a gajillion cut scenes and then fight non stop. Got bored after about an hour and a half and haven't touched it since.
3,disappointed,I loved final fantasyVII. I've been waiting for another game of this type to come along that I liked as much. This wasn't it. I was aggravated several times. Although it was enjoyable for the most part I kept coming to parts where I had difficulty figuring out what to do next. When I got on NeNe's ship and couldn't find my way through even though I wandered around systematically for hours I just quit with it. The fun wasn't worth the frustration. Maybe they were trying to force me to buy a guide book. Not going to happen. There are too many other games around that are just as fun without all the frustration. Tom
2,"Unoriginal, Uncompelling, and Childish","If you are old enough to be thoroughly considering your options in what game to purchase next, then you are likely old enough to start having more mature tastes by now. A choppy framerate, and a shallow and derisive story cannot be saved by the uncommonly good musical score. Try instead ""Lost Odyssey"", which is an extremely solid choice for those who feel a need to scratch that turn-based RPG itch on the Xbox 360, and a much better value for your time and money."
1,Poor RPG,"I am not an active gamer, yet 'Blue Dragon' was way too easy even for my standards. I don't mind playing easy games that are fun. But 'Blue Dragon' has provided me no entertainment value whatsoever. After having started the game, my character did not die once. I understand this game is one of the first turn-based RPGs for XBOX 360. But the team behind making 'Blue Dragon' had the former Final Fantasy creator contributing to its work. So I've had quite the high expectations prior to purchasing this game. Unfortunately, 'Blue Dragon' brought me nothing but boredom that I stopped playing after several hours."
3,above average.,"I'm not an avid gamer anymore, but i do know a good game when i play one. This one in particular is above average, as far as fun factor goes.Graphics are good,( there are some slowdown issues at times, and skipping in some scenes) sound ranges from ok to really good,( if your not under 16 you will find some of the voice work to be really annoying), gameplay is as easy and traditional as a japanese rpg can be. Story is nothing special, same ol good kids versus a terribly evil villain, there are some small twists here and there for good measure. For me the most enjoying part is character upgrades. everything else was above average."
3,A fun video game,"this was a Christmas gift for one of my sons, he is into the XBox 360 games since he got the player on his birthday, I'm not into this kind of stuff but the young kids are these days. Also the price was right at the time I bought it."
3,not too shabby,the game itself isn't quite what i had hoped for but my son loves it so the purchase wasnt a total bust
5,Great Game,"I bought this as a gift for my fiance. He finds it challenging and incredibly fun.I bought it after for searching through games he would likely enjoy based on the games he loves, such as Final Fantasy."
1,Poo monsters - REALLY????,"This game is not only boring, it is horrible. I have been a Toriyama Akira fan since dragonball was on JUMP!, but this is a nightmare. Te characters are not lovable, the graphics are good but all the humans & monsters look stupid, and the slime is replaced by a poo monster. Even in Japanese, its ridiculous. This game might be good for 3rd graders, but I would feel bad giving it to anyone. The game gets worse and worse as you play it. Dragon Quest lovers, beware - this is not dragon quest and unless you are in love with grinding for absolutely no reason stay away. You can't pay me to play this game."
4,Blue dragon is a good rpg for the 360.,"This a great rpg, but not comparable to Final Fantasy. I t may have been created by the guy who help propel FF on PlayStation, but this won't have that effect on 360.It's three disc and has descent cut scenes, the play is like any other rpg, the shadow class is great plus, you can change any of the charters abilities. The achievements are a problem, just like in most of the rpgs that I've played, you need to have more that one file, and its gets boring after a while having to always battle to get you level and SP up to unlock achievements.Blue Dragon great, but If you not into rpgs, I would stay away."
5,Great Game,"I love RPG's and this one is a good mix of old turn-based play and new graphics. I don't know how I feel about the Dragon Ball Z style characters yet, but they do show off the 3D rendering power of the X Box 360. I bought the game along with the 360. My wife and I spent an entire weekend playing and wanted to continue but when you're over 40 life still gets in the way of the important things. We definately expect more good things out of microsoft...a company that large should be able to afford good gaming engineers.P.S. Buy from Amazon.com, you'll always know where and when your stuff is. They even e-mailed me of a shipping problem and they took care of it at no cost to me...good to know a company still cares about service."
4,J-RPG at last,"It's about time that a good RPG comes to the xbox360.The graphics are great.The storyline is tangled with drama.The gameplay is traditional.If you love Japanese style RPG and Dragon Ball, you love this.All RPG fans should check it out at this new lower price."
4,"Fun times, cute animation","I heard good things about Blue Dragon so I picked it up. I found great graphics, an entertaining storyline, fun characters and enemies, and a great tutorial for learning all the ins and outs of all the combat and equipping etc. (RPG fans will relate when I say that sometimes this aspect of an RPG can become cumbersome) but this game is not. However, my character is pretty leveled up for the current stage of the game (its pretty early on) and I keep getting beaten by a giant bear. I am borderline frustrated with it at this point and have placed it back on a shelf for a second try later. I do reccommend you give this one a try though if you are a fan of RPG's and are looking for something new. I was also surprised to open up the case and find 3 discs inside...should be a fairly engrossing experience once i get past that bear..."
4,From somebody who play JRPG since FF Mystic Quest...,"This game is overall a decently fun game to play. The battle system is pretty standard JRPG, however the great mix of combination for all the classes is the reason what kept me playing. The storyline is very linear. However, like any other JRPG, you will be able to roam unexplored areas for treasures and hidden bosses towards end of the game. Blue Dragon is definitly a great game to try/play for any hardcore RPG players as well for those who are new to RPGs."
4,very very LONG!,"Great game for the younger crowd. I would say it is acceptable for all ages and fun for the adults too. It is very long; 3 disks, and to honest, by the end, I wanted it to be over. All in all a good game for a little distraction."
3,Missing,Did not say the puzzle was used and also there was 4 pieces missing from finished product. I am no longer able to mat and frame this piece.
4,Suprised,"While I don't normally read Sci-Fi books, I found myself enjoying Infusion by Clint Smith. I liked that one of the main characters was a stong female who eventually overcame her male counterparts. The environmental aspect of the plot was fascinating, as we are well aware that what happens in one part of our world affects everyone to some degree. While I read for enjoyment and not the technical aspects of a book, I appreciated things like the direction at which the aliens went to earth since we do not currently monitor the North and South poles for ""invasion"". I found myself wrapped up in what was going to happen, who was going to survive, what would happen to earth, and I hope Clint writes a sequel since the end left me with questions I would like to see him answer in a follow up book."
5,Infusion by Clint Smith,"Infusion by Clint Smith is one of the few science fiction I've read. I prefer my Sci Fi on the big or small screens. Having said that, Infusion kept me coming back for more. The book goes to great lengths to provide the technical nuances, which can some times be overlooked. It starts off slow developing plots and personalities. Then like a roller coaster it rockets you toward the finish. Although any the open questions were answered at the end, I found myself wanting to know more about the charters fates. The plot could easily spawn a sequel or two. I would recommend Infusion to everyone."
5,adventure and activism,"Twenty years after writing Tuareg, Alberto Vazquez-Figueroa decides to put his ability to write adventures in strange places into the defense of the Tuareg people.In the middle of the Sahara desert a rally pilot ends the peaceful living of the Sayah family (the family of Tuareg's heroe, Gacel Sayah) by poisoning the well's water (the only means of survival). From now on this family is at war. The next racers that come by are captured and used to trade for the culprit so that their ancient law can be enforced and justice made.In this book you'll have adventure, you'll learn something from one very old culture and you'll be faced with the biz behind a sports event that moves huge quantities of money.Suggestion: read Tuareg first, if you haven't already. The best adventure I've ever read."
4,Interesting Concept,"I thought the book felt not completely resolved, perhaps because PKD meant to revisit some time later for a follow up and never had the opportunity?"
3,Conflicted,"My mission is to read every Hugo and Nebula nominee and winner that has been converted to Kindle format, which led me to this book.This is a very well written story, and I very much like Dick's style and manner of writing. But I am bored by alternate histories; the stuff simply puts me to sleep.So great writing, and if you like alternate histories you should read this. For myself, it was all I could do to persevere and finish it.Only additional comment I would add is that the book is a downer and I didn't much care for the ending."
3,"interesting, but flawed..",Highly acclaimed novel by troubled author Dick which loses its interesting premise somewhere amidst the numerous alternate realities. Recommended for history/poly. sci. buffs but it's definitely not a typical science fiction thriller by any means. Stereotyped (arguably intentionally so) characters flood this novel and calling it open ended is a definite understatement.
1,What is the point?,"This book makes no sense. Granted as everyone says this book is an alternate history of if Germany and Japan won the big war. This book is not organized well, there are quite a few characters and each chapter tells a little bit more of the story. Only a few of the characters actually cross paths. The end makes no sense. This book was neither good nor bad but I can't say that it wasn't a waste of time. I am very disappointed as this is the 1st book by this author I read and I probably won't try another one of his books."
1,Strong Contender for Worst Book of the Century,"A great idea...what if the Axis powers won the war? Feeble execution, really having nothing to do with that premise. If you like bizarre, plotless jibberish, this is the book for you! A few recognizable Third Reich names thrown in are the only connection to the original concept. Otherwise, I have no idea what this book was about. It annoys me to waste my time with a book like this but because it was short, I plodded through to the end. My overall impression was to question the mental well-being of ""Mr. Dick"". As for winning the Hugo Award, that ""credential"" won't influence any of my book selections in the future - in fact, I'll avoid ANYTHING that received that ""commendation""."
1,This book was awful!,"I cannot believe I invested time in this book. It started off great, but then dragged and dragged. When Wegner spilled the beans about the German invasion plans, I thought the book would take off, but it was hardly ever mentioned again. The characters were flat and boring. And the ending, AAAAGGGHHHH!I am a salesman, and read all kinds of books to relate to my clients. If I ever met anyone who liked this book, I would run the other way. One question to whoever liked this book: Do you have a job or do you work at Borders and wear a turtleneck and have 15 piercings and smoke dope?"
3,"Pretty good, but hardly PKD's best","Years ago I was a huge PKD fan, haven't read any for some time and for some reason way-back when, I never read this, which some people claim to be his best. Well, I bought a copy and wasn't blown away, I'll take PKD's short stories, or maybe _Flow My Tears_ anyday (I need to reread that...). It was nice to see PKD break from the 'sci-fi' mold, albeit a few mere mentions of Mars, but if you want a alternate history book I would read Robert Harris' _Fatherland_ (read _Enigma_ too) for a better story."
2,What a waste of time,"If I would have known what I was getting into, I wouldn't have read it. There are some interesting images conjured by this book, and Dick does some good characterizations, but that's it. The plotlines run helter-skelter, and there is no real conclusion, no payoff. Immensely overrated in my opinion."
3,Meh,"It was well written in some respects. However, the attempt at making the Easternized English, while perhaps adding some authenticity, became drudging to move through. Coupled with the all the eastern Yin/Yang I Ching stuff...it's just not my cup of tea. The other plot lines weren't exactly the most interesting either. Characters I didn't particularly care for, and an unfulfilled ending.When the Japanese man, Mr. Tagomi, had his episode....I really wish(and thought prior to reading the book) that was the direction the story would take. You're left with some interesting implications after finishing your read...but unfortunately the read itself was not that interesting."
3,"Interesting, but...","Interesting plot, in a quintessentially Dick-ian way, but the writing is awkward, and for a sci-fi novel that is more about alternate history than it is about a future society shaped by imaginary technology, his depiction of a Sino-Japanese culture is not convincing -- no explanation is given for the Japanese's fascination with the I-Ching, for example."
2,No mas,"This is one of the few books that I got 1/2 way through and gave up. By the time I gave up I felt like I was walking hip deep in mud. The plot was going nowhere and not only did not not identify with the characters I actively disliked them all. And this it actually fine if they are interesting, or the plot is interesting, or SOMEthing is interesting. Reading some of the reviews I see talk of a surprise ending and if I made it through neck deep mud only to reach some ""sooper kool"" ambigous ending I'd probably scream."
3,Whi Is John Gault (The Man.......),"Interesting speculation, but essentially pointless.The ending is obscure and unsatisfactory. It is as if the writer decided that he wanted to finish the book and go have a drink"
2,Where's the story?,"Although the author lays the foundation for a skyscraper, developing the characters and their environment in this ""Japan and Germany won the war"" alternative history, in the end, I was left wondering why the building collapsed halfway through construction. Half a book deserving half a Hugo."
3,Not a plot driven story but powerful nonetheless.,"This is certainly Dick's best novel -- the ending gives you the unique feeling and ""twist"" that only a Philip K. Dick novel can provide. The plotting isn't much but the point is psychological, not dramatic. However, if you want to read Dick at his best buy one of the anthologies that has these two stories -- ""Faith of Our Fathers"" and ""Frozen Journey."" I promise you will never have such a unique and eerie reading experience again."
2,Good for its day,"I feel that this book gets such high ratings due to the fact that it was written in the 60's. Of course this was an important and exciting work back then, but today I think it is rather dull. The author does a great job of developing characters, and telling a story. However, where is the plot and the excitement? Another reviewer mentioned that you need to read this book at least twice to really grasp what is going on. I agree with this and also the fact that it wasn't entertaining enough to justify reading it again. I believe what people want to see today is for the author to go one step further with the alternate timeline(s), and show some action or consequences. This book left you hanging, and wanting a little too much. But that's just my opinion..."
2,Disappointing,"I always heard how great Philip Dick was, so I was interested in finally trying one of his books. Three months later I finally dragged myself to the end of this bizarre tale. The theme was fine, but the details were tedious, and the characters and story were simply not that interesting, plus the stilted use of the English language was annoying. And did I mention the ending wasn't very satisfactory, either? Sorry, fans!"
4,Our world as it might have been ...,"In this nightmarish ""alternate history"" novel, the United States and the Allied Powers were soundly defeated in World War II, and America is now occupied by Nazi Germany east of the Mississippi, and Japan in the West. Erwin Rommel is Military Governor of Nazi Occupied America, in which the Nazi racial purity laws are in full and vigorous effect. In the west, Japan rules with a more humane, but still an iron hand, and in both areas Americans themselves are a downtrodden minority and underclass in their own country, and America is being colonized by the victors.But is this real? Or is this alternate universe a mistake; a kind of kink in time? The reader must judge. Author Dick specializes in stories that test the meaning and substantive nature of reality, and that is part of the theme of this compelling novel.This is one of the great ""alternate history"" novels of Science Fiction, and you do not want to pass it up."
2,"""What if"" this novel had a better ending?","Normally a fan of ""alternate history"" stories, I found ""The Man in the High Castle"" disappointing. Although Dick creates a tangible and believable backdrop, he squanders it in a meandering mess.The promising premise introduced never comes to fruition. These characters go about their daily lives, and we follow them, but aside from displaying unique cirsumstances, this novel has very little plot.I also found Dick's obsession with the occult (particularly foretune-telling) annoying, as well as out of place. At times, I could not be sure if this was a novel or a new age treatise on the I-Ching.Let's not even get into the problems with this version of history that Dick flat out ignores, such as the fact that it would be next to impossible for any occupation force to successfully hold North America.Add to all of that an ending that really isn't an ending at all, and you're left to wonder just how sparse the field was when this work won the Hugo award."
2,Great Literature == Plotless,"Philip K. Dick's ""The Man in the High Castle"" is, I'm sure, great literature. It won a major award. It's got an interesting theme just bursting at the seams. It's filled with a well thought-out alternate history resulting from the Axis winning World War II. It's technically well-written with highly developed characters etc.. The only thing it's missing is that minor detail called a plot. You can only read so much pointless exposition by the characters laying out the alternate history from within the minutia of their trivial lives. After a while, it just wears thin. So, if you love Literature (with a capital ""L""), go ahead and read this. But, if you love a good story, give it a pass. I rate it at a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5."
1,Displeasing at the very least,I found Philip K. Dick to be a racist bigot. I don't care what the context of the book is; his casual use of racist terms is uncalled for and should not have been published.
5,"Another of Dick's great conversations with ""reality""","This is only my third Dick book, but it's my favorite so far. Few other authors have ever given me the feeling that the characters are simultaneously fictitious and real. It's hard to explain if you haven't read it. Dick piles up ideas of weirdness that seem unusual in their normality. And not just his ideas. He uses a language that had me dipping from one character's brain into another. Great writing style."
4,brilliant conception,"Dick has an incredibly inventive mind and is always intellectually stimulating. I've never thought, however, that the quality of his prose matches the quality of his imagination. Still, very much worth reading."
2,Dated Dick,"I had heard that this slim novel, in which Germany and Japan have divided up American, after winning WWII, was one of the best alternate history books ever. Being a moderate counterfactual history fan, I was excited to such a book by someone as respected as Dick. Unfortunately, while the setup is excellent, there's almost no plot to hold the reader's attention. The story, such as it is, hovers around San Francisco and a few people trying to work within this postwar system, where everyone has ""place"" or rank. There are some interesting incidents and characters, but ultimately they get bogged down in meaningless mystic nonsense. I can see how in 1962, when the book first appeared, the combination of alternate history and I Ching-babble must have been revolutionary, but both have been been done so much better since, that this ends up feeling quite dated and inadequate. Most disappointing of all is the obscure non-ending."
4,First Rate Fiction,"Dick is the master of the sleight of hand, defying reality with his novels and short stories. Plus, like all great sci fi, or speculative fiction, he creates a ""real"" world with ""real"" people and yet somehow makes the reader keep turning those pages. A great read, by a great story-teller."
3,Alternate History... Or is it?,"1962: the Allies lost the war and Germany and Japan are the new powers of the world. America is divided between the two, Japan controlling the West and Germany the East. Genocide rages in Africa and Germany is exploring space with a vengeance. The picture is horrifying and brilliantly sketched by Dick. Believable character development. I will have to read it again to determine if I actually enjoyed this book. Of course, if you read it, be prepared for the Dick-ian twist at the end..."
2,"Interesting concept, but no story.","I must confess some disappointment with this book. It had an interesting, if terrifying premise, essentially being that America lost WW II and the Eastern half was occupied by the Germans and the Western half by the Japs. The book started by describing life under these circumstance, but then made only an abortive attempt of telling a story, concluding with a ""and then I woke up"" sort of ending. Disappointing. Also,from a historical point of view, it also gives too much credit to Roosevelt, saying that only he kept the US from rolling over and surrendering, which is an absolute absurdity."
3,"I don't usually feel this dense, but.......","Consider myself to be at least of average intelligence, but what was with that ending? Is he talking about the physical reality or the psychological? I actually read this book first when I was in grade school...didn't get a lot out of it then but remembered for over 20 years the ending and how I didn't uderstand it. Saw the book in the store the other day and said ""I'll try again""....got more of the book's subtext....but you know my feeling on the ending.....still. Gave it three stars because I actually thought it was an interesting read. Good charicterizations and interplay between the seperate (yet joint) story lines. I agree with a previous reviewer that the description of Tagomi's breakdown was incredible."
2,"""What if"" this novel had an ending?","As alternate history goes, ""The Man in the High Castle"" starts off strong, but meanders it's way to a forgetable, unfulfilling conclusion.I had heard such high praise of this work, I could barely believe I was reading the right novel. Dick draws a wonderful picture of his alternate world at the beginning of the novel, but then does very little with it.And for a Science Fiction novel to lend such weight to occult practices (i.e. fortune-telling) is almost an insult to the genre. I thought at times I was reading a New Age treatise on the I-Ching.And all of this doesn't even take into account the lackluster, anti-climactic ending, which leaves the reader in a state of general disinterest."
5,A classic with a point,"This is one of Dick's better books, which of course means it's pretty close to perfect. The idea of 'alternative reality' has been handled many times since, but I think Philip K. was one of the first, and to this day, he must be the only one to get such visions ot of the concept. The book feels strange and dreamy, which is purely functional: after all, it's about a dream. Or a global illusion. Whatever you wish... Dick gives no easy answers. Surely worth reading."
4,Great Read!!,"I liked the dark drama of the story. It is totally ""1984"" surreal. The entire plot reads like a spy movie noir. It's difficult to tell where the science fiction comes in. Given the year in which Philip Dickwrote it, the day in the life approach was perfect. Reccommended read for a diverse group of literature fans. I really enjoyed ""The Man in The High Castle ""."
5,The Man in the High Castle,"One of the most spellbinding books, I've ever read. I don't wish to surmise the book, or give my analysis on what Mr. Dick was trying to say. He makes you genuinely care for the character's. I wish that thier ultimate fates, and the ultimate fate of thier world was written to full conclusion. The monster Heydrich's faction, and his motivation's left me peticulary hungry."
4,"Difficult, But Timeless","This is not an easy book to read. However, the counter-factual approach to history and to the narrative make it interesting throughout and one of his best books. The characters are believable and powerful. Dick's descriptions of places and objects (down all the way to Civil war weaponry) help build a world for a reader that might not the most comfortable, but one that is hard to leave."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Split states spoils of war.This novel is an alternate history, and one of the favorite subjects of such books - World War 2.Here the Allies lose, and the USA is occupied territory, split, naturally enough to be half owned by Japan, and half by Germany (west versus east).Needless to say, this is now not a very nice place, and tensions also exist between the two occupying forces.An author here is working on a book that would result in a severe punishment - an alternate history of his own where the Allies did not lose the war.3.5 out of 5"
2,PKD has written far better...,"PKD's recent literary resurgence has led to a (long overdue) reconsideration of his work. The Man In The High Castle won the Hugo Award, and is often sighted as among his best novels. And while the premise is certainly intriguing, the book is exceedingly poorly written - and not in a pulpy, so-bad-it's-good kind of way. PKD was a great risk taker as a writer and he deserves credit for that; he has written some fantastic, delirious and chaotic books that defy easy categorization (A Scanner Darkly is a great place to start), but this isn't one of them."
2,"Interesting, at best","Philip K. Dick is, in a Douglas Adams sort of way, a man who obviously has a lot of interesting ideas. His novel, ""The Man in the High Castle,"" about America in an alternate reality in which the Allies lost WW2, makes use of these. But while his speculations on politics and foreign relations in general are interesting, his plotline is not.The characters, whose endeavors, of course, seem unrelated at first but come together in the end, aren't compelling, and, while having some interesting thoughts on their world, fail to engage the reader. The story moves slowly, and the philisophical musings aren't enough to justify it.In the end, a moderately interesting read, but not as fascinating as you might think."
1,Where is the Story?,"Granted, Philip K. Dick fans will love this book no matter what. And it's aclaimed by others, but if you are looking for a STORY.... well you are in for a disapointment. It has a resonance, a feel that is dark and impressive, but there is no story. How can this be a classic for some people? Obviously it's 'feel' is so strong, that people love to return to it over and over again. But it lacks true writer's 'craft'. It has no structure, and you will want to throw the book against the wall when you finish. I just love some of Dick's stuff, but if you looking for a story, this isn't it. Atmosphere? Yes. Story? No."
1,Don't even bother reading,"It's about jewlery. Don't even waste your time reading it.This is easily the worst thing i have read from Philip K Dick. His other works were amazing and this one had so much potential but this one lacked all of the things that made his other works superb. No plot, no real conflict literally nothing happens for the entire book. Up until this book PKD was my favorite science fiction writer but this one came as a slap to the face. The more you read the more you hope something will happen but it never does and you are left with the horrible realization that you have wasted a load of time with only a giant middle finger as a reward. Normally a book like this would take me a few hours reading, but i could barely read three or four pages before my attention was lost. If PKD were still alive I would write him asking for my money back."
2,Dick's incredible premise is poorly executed,"The world that Dick has created here, is absolutely brilliant. What would the world be like, what would the United States be like, had America and the Allies lost World War II? It's such an interesting question. Dick does a great job taking the reader inside this strange world. Jewish people live in hiding. The Japanese collect old American trinkets, like Mickey Mouse watches, and showcase them as collectors items. It's so believable.But the plot of this book seems to go nowhere. There are several different plotlines that mostly don't intersect, making the reader wonder, ""what's the point of having these characters at all?"" To me the most fascinating story in the book follows Mrs. Frink as she looks to find the writer, the ""Man in the High Castle.""The ending is confusing, and although it makes the reader think about what this world would be like, it's not a satisfying conclusion to everything we've read before it."
3,Bearable,"'The Witching Hour' was a fantastic book, no question about it. But trying to get through 600 pages of 'Lasher' was like pulling hair.The mythology was outstanding, I'll give the book that much, and you're left wanting to learn more. However, the character of Mona Mayfair drove me up the wall and I found myself wishing she would be Lasher's next ill-fated victim. I'm not so weak stomached that I can't stand the sexualized child in horror fiction, but this was just ridiculous.Michael Curry wasn't completely unlikable, but his acceptance of his affair with Mona was just creepy. And, being halfway through 'Taltos' I'm anticipating even more creepiness.Another star is given for the ending, which was just fantastic and showcases Rice's ability to paint a picture with words."
3,A bit draggy but satisfactory in the end.,"Rice knows how to creep people. Yes, true. But in her detailed story telling, she makes you want to sleep. One factor that didn't make me slumber was using instrumental CD's to make my reading exciting. She has too much nonsense flashbacks and x-rated incidents. Blood Gore and Sex and Occultism was a nice touch...but plus Flashbacks? Adding the fourth ingredient was all right but she added too much. You'll only get satisfied after reading the whole book. It doesn't make you say ""Wow"" while reading it. Only after."
4,Found it only on Amazon,"I looked in all of the resale book stores for Lasher but no luck. So finally I looked on Amazon and found in for a great price! It arrived very quickly, in great shape, right before I went on vacation."
2,Not what was described,"This book was described as in good condition with some wear. The book I received was in poor condition. The cover was coming off, and there were stains all through the book. I will not order from this vendor again!"
4,"I'm supposed to feel something here, right?","Well, this certainly is not the best of Anne Rice's books...But for the content and genre it is one of the best. If you want to read a book about witches and demons, this would be a good choice. I was a little repelled by the violence and sex, but I also beleive that it added a greater depth to the story and the characters. Being 13, my brain has not yet gained the capacity to understand some of the emotions shown in this book, but I think as far as the story goes I understood. I wouldn't recommend this book for people with weak stomachs or for those to young to be engaged in this kind of reading. (You may be thinking i'm too young, but I believe that as long as you understand the content to a certain extent, your not too young for any book.) In short, I liked it. I recommend this book for any Anne Rice fan or anyone who is fond of the horror/tragedy/drama genre. That is all I have to say."
3,A curate's Egg,"Anne Rice has a tendency to write brilliant first novels, and inconsistent sequels. Lasher is no exception. At times in Lasher Rice's sophisticated, mesmerising--charged--prose is enough to lift the reader far enough into the heavens to inhibit one's reason. However, at the crucial moment when Rice needs to bring all of the strands together in a satisfying conclusion, she fails. When she does so it's a bit like being in the crowd watching the Emperor with no clothes. While Rice thinks she's getting away with it, you witness an ending that's threadbare--a great story that unravels embarrasingly before your eyes.Still Lasher is very much worth reading. I have a friend that always stops reading 20 pages before the end of the book. I suggest you do the same and make up your own ending."
4,Good but......,"Lasher is the middle book in the ""Witching Hour"" triology. It fills out more of the ""family tree"" both in current family members, but also it fills out the depth/history of the previous generations. I missed the chemistry between Michael and Rowan, that didn't come in till near the end and then is seemed sparse. I know Ms Rice needs to set the stage for the final book - Taltos - in the trilogy and the excerpts do reference Michael and Rowan but I miss them.Not wanting to give away the story line, the chapters on Julien's life were some of the the most enjoyable sections"
3,Ridiculous story,"I guess if you read the first book, then you want to read the series. This book is just so out there- more so than the first one. Is it entertaining?- Yes -but it kind of dragged on in my opinion. It's obviously a fictional story, but a little to over the top for me. I've read many books and these are a good example of books you sometimes choose after you finish a few really great books/ classics. They are just easy to read and entertaining to some degree. The overabundance of sexual content turned me off, especially when characters are having sex with minors. I'm not even sure i should have given it 3 stars. I feel I have a duty to finish the series since I devoted so much time to it already."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK TOO!!!!,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!!! Again Rice dives into such a rich history family that sometimes it is overwhelming but some of the things that have gone on in that family! GEEZ!!!!! I got so emotionally involed with these characters that I was FURIOUS when Rowan Ran away with Lasher!!! My poor Michael! LOL~ Loved this story, sometimes it was a little overwhelming but stick with it! I think it was well worth it!!!!"
5,An awsome series,"All I can say is I've enjoyed reading every one of Anne's books and I do mean every one. Some I've already gone on my third reading, there is so much detail with her novels I feel as tho I'm reading it for the first time.All I can say is Thank You Anne Rice for so much enjoyable reading time.All I can say to any one reading this and all reviews before me, Buy and enjoy a great author."
4,Wow!,"Loved the Mayfair Witches and the follow-up Lasher. Too terrifying to think about genetically modifying a person to become what someone else wants. On the other hand, is this not found in modern medicine? If you only read two of Anne Rice, read Mayfair and Lasher. I read Taltos and found it disappointing. It was almost as if she ran out of steam, had a contract, and wanted to get it finished."
1,read only if you like this specific style a lot,"Books 1 and 2 of this series sound like an incest diary. I haven't finished book 2 (Lasher), I was hoping book 1 was as intro to a more exciting story developing in book 2. I can appreciate the plot and some of the expositions, but the overbearing incest/pedophilia pressure just throws me off."
4,Happy Reader,The book was in amazing condition and I couldnt have been more pleased. You cannot beat the price anywhere! Will for sure look for more to purchase.
4,It was o-kay,"This is a great book, it just would have been so much better if Rice didn't drag it so long. She just took too long describing actions and stuff. Other than that it lived up it's predecessors standards."
5,EXTREMELY HYPNOTIC!****,I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT EXPLAINED A LOT OF LASHER'S PROBLEMS AND WHY HE TREATED ROWAN THE WAY HE DID. IT WAS WONDERFULLY WRITTEN * I ACTUALLY FELT THIS PAIN THAT HE EXHIBITED THROUGHT OUT THE BOOK IN THE WITCHING HOUR AND TALTOS
4,Read Lasher,"Having never read Ann Rice I picked up Lasher not realising it was a sequel. Although I was very confused at first, as I hadn't read the Witching Hour, I loved the book tremendously and am currently reading the Witching Hour. Lasher introduced me to the amazing world of Ann Rice novels."
5,LASHER IS A FANTASTIC READ,"This book is fantastic as are most all of Anne Rice's works (before her conversion to Christianity...I haven't read her works after the year 2000). The entire Witching Hour series is unbelievably good and a MUST READ if you love anything paranormal. Also check out all of her other works including Cry To Heaven (my favorite) and the entire Vampire Chronicle series- which is far superior to anything in the current Twilight craze. Also check her out as a porn writer in the Erotic Adventures of Sleeping Beauty Series if you want some juicy subject materials to reinvigorate your sexual relationships. I loved everything she wrote prior to 2000 with the exception of Feast of All Saints about the mulatos of New Orleans. For some reason, it was so dry I couldn't get through the first chapter before I got rid of it."
1,writing not worth the hype,"I stumbled upon this series through word of mouth. I have yet to hear someone say that Anne Rice is anything other than the great at writing....BOY IS THAT A LIE!I found the series lacking! There were some random moments where I would think ""ok now it will get good!"" sadly i was let down. This is the first book of her's that I have read...Honestly I find myself wishing that a better writer would have had the idea for the books that way maybe the story line could have been salvaged. Obviously that is not the case...she ruined it with awkwardly written sex scenes and just an all around lack luster appeal to the books."
3,"Not a great sequel, not a bad book","Anne Rice's ""Lasher,"" while not a bad book, was a disappointing sequel. There is too much review of what went on in ""The Witching Hour"" and not enough emphasis on new material. Not a bad piece of work on its own though."
2,Hated it. Thousands of pages wasted on those Mayfair witches,"I couldn't believe how quickly the storyline crashed after the first book of this trilogy, The Witching Hour . The prose got so purple and convoluted, I wanted to scream. I was thrilled when the author decided to abandon these dopey incestuous witches and got back to the vampires."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Another heaping helping of Mayfair witches, spirits, and incest. Rowan has vanished, and a precocious teenaged Mayfair witch appears in this book. She goes after Rowan's husband, and Lasher kidnaps her and gets her pregnant multiple times, finally resulting in a child.Some scientific investigating shows Rowan is a freak, so Lasher's plan to pump his seed into all the Mayfair witches may not do much, as the reason he was successful with Rowan was because of her mutant nature.Not a lot of point to this, I think."
2,Considering previous novels; disappointing,"I have had the pleasure of reading the Vampire Chronicles, Cry to Heaven, and Sevant of the Bones. I feel Anne Rice is a wonderful writer with enthralling descriptive powers. To put it simply, Lasher was a disappointment. I didn't bother finishing the last 1/4 of the book.I would also have no problem using the word ""drivel"" in my description of this book. While Rice is an excellent writer, consider some of her other books for your choice of reading."
5,Lasher was as enthralling as the Witching Hour.,"I read The Witching Hour and was completely unable to put it down and when I went out and bought the sequel, Lasher, it was just as enthralling. This book is the best Anne Rice novel I have yet to read. It pulled me in and I am still wanting more even though I have finished the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little of the unusual and erotic."
5,I loved it,I loved the whole series of books. This is a great bridge between the first and third books. I recommend this highly.
1,Ridiculous,"Half the time you never knew which character was the voice she was using to narrate. The story line was importantly carried from Book 1, however she got so lost in describing details of an area , a house, a conversation, that the reader just gets lost and closes the book. I tried to get a refund for Lasher and Taltos, but I had lost the time window for returns."
2,Unworthy attempt at historical validation of fantasy.,"After ""The Witching Hour"" those that hunger to know the fate of Michael and his abducted-seducted wife will find that the wonderful, brooding sensual quality of that novel is not to be found in this half-hearted tale centered upon Lasher's rebirth as a physical being.This is merely a dry effort, spent perhaps for the contract terms Rice may suffer under, but that is not an excuse for a work which has no real depth, no terror, no eroticism, and only minimal character development.Through even the Sleeping Beauty series, Rice was able to sustain something of the ""weaver of tales"" I have come to expect of her works. Unfortunately, the tapestry she normally weaves seems to have unravelled this time."
3,worth the read,"I did enjoy this book. I felt that it was very beautifully written. Although, it seems that sometimes Anne rattles on and on about absolutly nothing, somehow in the end she finds a point.In this book Lasher is finally in human form. And he must find another mayfair witch to create a being called the ""Taltos"". But to get to this point and understand it, you pretty much need a reference book of scottish history.It would have been better if AR would have stuck to the witch format, instead of the Taltos. But you get hooked and you have to find out what happens.If you've read ""The Witching Hour"", then you will probably read this just to find out what happened to Rowan."
2,a boring read,i tried to read this a few years ago and it made me yawn more than it made me want to save it to my book collection. it seemed to drag on and on through the pages. i threw it out when i moved because i was so unattached to it to keep it. i wouldn't buy in the future to read it. i love Anne Rice books but not this one.
3,I liked The Witching Hour better.,Anne Rice is a wonderful author. She captures the scene as if she were really there. If you really want to know Michael and Rowans fate this is the book to read.
2,Definatly a let down,I give this story 2 stars cause I havent finished it yet and It has been a week. (I have alot of time to read) This is not what I expected since the withching hour was so good. The book is long and drawn out in places where I have actually skipped pages skimming for important information and not lost the story at all. I will finish it just cause I am dying to know what happens. But I am not sure I will read Taltos. I am afraid of being let down again. Anne Rice is such a good writer and this is definatly one of her weakest.
3,If I hear DELICIOUS One more time....,I enjoyed this book but the word delicious was way overused! I wanted to stick my finger down my throat every time I came across it! Afraid to pick up Taltos due to horrible reviews and fear of DELICIOUS!
2,"Needs an editor, badly","Anne Rice's greatest strength has always been her colourful writing, her lavish imagery, and her descriptive prowess. Her greatest weakness has always been the recycling of character traits from book to book (one suspects these are merely traits of Ms. Rice herself) and never coming up with anything new or interesting. She is seemingly incapable of creating ugly or interesting characters, preferring them to be beautiful, brilliant, and ultimately one-dimensional.All of these problems are painfully present in Lasher and obfuscate what might have been a really clever story. The characters of Rowan, Michael, Julien and Mona were ridiculous and laughable and made it impossible to take this book seriously."
1,Worst book I ever read!,"Pointless, ridiculous plot. Awful characters. I can't believe I read the entire book. I've read some book that were long and started out weak, but eventually got better. I kept hoping this would happen for Lasher, but it never did. Don't waste your time with this book. This book should have never been published. This book wasted 4 days of my life"
5,i cant believe some of these reviews!,"Hello! What is wrong with some of these reviewers? If you cannot recognize the amazing writing style of ann rice, then you are not worthy of even having her books! Lasher was an awesome follow up from the witching hour. If you have any sense of what a good read is, then you will be a fan of this book...and of the next one..taltos!"
3,book condition is ok,"I am very pleased at the timeliness of the shipping and delivery of this item. I was however shocked to see it was a larger book, not the small paperback I was expecting. It is heavier and harder to hold when I'm reading. I would have liked to know that before purchasing."
3,Definitely not the best from Anne Rice,"It really sort of saddens me when I read a book that has so much potential, but instead rambles on and on and on........Ah! this took me forever to get through. After the ""Witching Hour"" I was so excited to read this book. I was disappointed. But I will say towards the end, Julian's conversation with Michael, reliving his journey to Donnelaith and such is worth reading. Also, Lasher's explanation of how he came into being is worth a read. However, there is so much in this book that is NOT worth reading, I don't think I'd recommend it on the whole. For die-hard Anne Rice fans such as myself, you might as well read it. For those of you looking for an interesting read or a book as riveting as the ""Witching Hour"", don't bother.Sorry Ms. Rice."
1,All out of Nyquil? Try reading this book....,"This was the shoddiest, most disorganized and ill conceived piece of drivel that I have read since rereading my junior high diary. Only a deep sense of injustice and groundless hope that the end would justify the means kept me reading through to the disappointing and absurd conclusion. Rice created an interesting and intriguing world in 'Cry to Heaven"" - she is capable of fine writing - but ""Lasher"" is an insult to her loyal readers as well as any unsuspecting citizen who picks up a copy of this book. Who would have believed that a book about demons, ghosts, murder, wealth, sex, and breastfeeding could be so numbingly dull?"
3,"All right, but what was with the Bible thumping?","I loved The Witching Hour, the first book in the trilogy, so I had high expectations for this one. For the most part, they were met, but there were a few problems, the first and foremost being Lasher's story. He spends almost 100 pages promoting Catholocism, and defaming Protestants. I'm neither, but it still offended me that the author used her character as a mouthpiece for her own religious beliefs. Mona, the new character on the scene, was quite interesting (for the first half, I thought she was a sociopath). All in all, three stars."
4,"Oh, Ann Rice, why do you make me suffer????","This secuel of ""The Witching Hour"" turns to be an excellent book of intrigue and horror, even when this book is not so good as the fist one, but it's understandable because this is a secuel, this is the one when the story becomes monstrous and cruel in all aspects, I am amazed of the capability of Ann Rice to dig in the most inner fears of human beeing and turn them into an unable to stop reading plot. If you think you don't have the stomach to deal with a book that will keep you in suspense, that will make you feel impotent and disgusted, then don't read it, because when Ann Rice wants to twist your guts she'll do it in the most crude and yet elegant way.Anyway, you have to read this book if you read ""The Witching Hour"" because neither of both books have sense if you don't read the other, including the third part of them called ""Taltos"", so, you have a decent trilogy to read."
1,...,"Absolute ..., and as far fetched as they come. What a disappointment after The Witching Hour! The series began with a sexy mysterious spirit following the generations of Mayfair Witches through the years(loved the concept). By the second book it was suddenly about a five thousand year old GUMBY! This series made The Vampire Chronicles read like an Almanac."
2,I rather get 50 lashes than to read this book..,"DREADFUL! It's boring, it drags, it's boring, it's a waste of money...and did I say it was boring? BECAUSE IT IS. It lacked explanation of the characters and why somethings occured..etc. And my book fell apart......there are better Anne Rice books out there...avoid this one. You can do better than this."
4,Good book,"First of all I have to say that in my opinion, the average of 3 1/2 stars is fair enough to this book.Don't get me wrong, it's a good book but it's not a masterpiece.I believe it would be better if, with Taltos as its sequel, it would be a separate saga. Why's that?Witching Hour was about a family, a clan and its link with a spirit; a story full of passion and mistery told from a human being point of view.In Lasher, Rice falls in a common place: with the purpose of explain everything she creates a new species.In my opinion this practice stole some mistery to the first book to create a new different story.With minor changes, it would be a new saga, starting from other point of view of existance, the Taltos point of view, which is a rich enough story itself.Anyway, I think is a good plot and a reasonable sequel."
2,Disappointing - pure silly,"I really enjoyed the first witches book, and I love the vampire ones, but Lasher is pure silly - I actually got bored reading it which is bad. Far too longwinded in terms of action - no substance to it at all. Annoying book especially the bits about Mona and also the constant breastfeeding."
5,"An impressive, engaging, highly recommended historical novel","Freedom Ships is an exciting and informative historical novel about African Americans who managed to go back to Africa in 1820 to find the freedom denied them in America decades before the Emancipation. Based on a neglected chapter in America's history, elements of the Freedom Ships narrative are reconstructed from emigrant letters, diaries, official reports in the Library of Congress, and U.S. Navy and Congressional archives. A highly recommended and engaging novel, Robert Carey and John Furbay have successfully collaborated to write an epic story of freed slaves who dare to risk all dangers in a vast and unknown continent so that their children could escape the inhuman bondage and overwhelming racial prejudice of slave era America."
2,A little too mellow,"I can feel Leonard Cohen's signature all over this release, but for me, Anjani was a little too mellow. I guess as background music it would be alright, but frankly for me, I found it a little depressing."
2,Made me sleepy,"I won't say that this singer is bad, and I'm sure she appeals to many people, but I found her music too slow, very syruppy and without passion. I bought this CD because I'm a Madeleine Peyroux fan and this artist was compared to her but they have nothing in common, that I can tell, other than sharing the same songs occasionally. Again, I'm sure many other people would enjoy this album, but not enough soul for me."
5,soft and sultry,"One of the best albums of this or any other year. This left me hungering for more from Anjani. I ordered Sacred Names and was equally impressed. Hard to categorize a genre but elements of Jazz,Pop, easy listening and soul. I would reccomend this for any lover of music and her collaboration with Leonard Cohen is icing on the cake."
5,"Lovely, ethereal, subtle","Blue Alert is similar in impulse to Jennifer Warnes's Famous Blue Raincoat (ie. female vocalist lovingly interpreting Cohen) and the album is every bit as excellent and memorable as Warnes's. But while Famous Blue Raincoat features more poppy interpretations (like ""First We Take Manhattan""), Anjani does slow and careful and more poetic versions, accompanied by her own bluesy music. Her voice is remarkable and always sounds very careful, and tinged with sweetness. She inhabits Cohen's pose of sophisticated feeling and intelligent humour beautifully, adding an innocent quality never present in Cohen's own singing. Her female voice adds an aspect of androgyny, a sort of vocal transvestism, to the Cohen persona. For sheer lyric loveliness and the evocation of a lost past, it's hard to beat ""The Golden Gate,""-- ""Looking back to San Francisco, wearing my blue Chinese dress, A yellow jacket with padded shoulders, smoking Sobranie cigarettes..."""
4,Great Zeppelin,This is a great selection of Led Zeppelin songs and the audio is very good. If you like Great White then this is a no brainer - Very Good Album!
3,so-so great white zeppelin,"I like this CD very much, the singer sounds like Plant without trying to, the songs are literally note for note and aren't bogged down by boring drum solo's or extended improvisation. The only problem I have, is it misses the pizzaz of Jimmy Page's guitar, it doesn't have that harder edge and lacks the way Jimmy can sound like two guitars at once, by the way, somebody said ""The Immigrant Song"" sucks, but it really doesn't. There are no baddies on the whole thing and it's cool to hear the tunes Zep rarely, if ever, played live."
4,Incredible Simulation,"Other than it being live (although emulating studio material), this is probably the best Zeppelin cover I've heard. The fact is that Zeppelin never sounded this good live (of course technology helps).If only Page and Plant could write new material (using their original style) and allow Great White to then record it, you might have a revitalization of Classic Rock. Page and Plant, just don't have the physical ability to sound good anymore, (especially Plant) due to the realities of old age (and alot of alcohol.)"
3,"These ""White"" Zeppelin Tributes are getting SCARY","Has anyone else noticed how the best Zeppelin Clone albums are by guys or bands named ""White"". First Michael White did a note for note perfection simulation of LZ, earlier Whitesnake was accused of ripping off Zep with ""Still of the Night"" and now Great White has done an admirable job of emulating Zeppelin with this album. When you consider that Jimmy Page was accused of dabbling in the BLACK arts it really makes you wonder if there are forces at work here of a diabolical nature. Still do not know if this is art....more like the Painters who do perfect reproductions of Picasso, Van Gogh, etc. Why buy this when the originals exist in several wonderful variations....boxed sets, remastered albums, bootlegs. Kinda neat to have though if only for the novelty and conversational value."
1,Ain't Nothin' Beats The Real Thing!,i just have something to tell all of ya readin' this..there ain't nothin' like the real thing............trust me on this
1,Horrible!,"The book is horrible on many different levels, please believe me when I say this. I am not interested to go in depth as to the many reasons I dislike this book, but I thought that I would warn future purchasers."
4,Strong stuff on relationships--especially for singles!,"Munroe hits a lot of it right on the head! No matter what situation you are in--married, single, etc.--you can't expect anyone else in your life to make you feel ""whole"" and ""complete."" The Apostle Paul said that we should be content in whatever state we are in. Until you can do that, don't look for contentment with someone else because you will be cheating yourself and the other person of a healthy relationship. Dr. Myles is a great teacher. You'll stretch and grow by reading this book!"
3,Good premise,"I'm still in the process of reading this book, but to be honest, I'm not sure I'll make it all the way through. I think the premise of the book is right on target. We all must be single, (whole) before we enter a relationship with someone else. Munroe's book certainly provides the reader with solid information about being a 'single' person; however, I felt that Christianity was being heralded as the ONLY way to be a worthwhile 'single' person.I feel many may be turned off by the strong push that this is the only direction in which you can be a whole person and have a successful life as a single or married person. I think the concepts could be present in a much softer way and more people would be understanding and appreciative of them."
3,So-So,"This book has some very good point expecially about being ""single"" However I didnt particular care for the authors tone reguarding particular issues about marriage and divorce specificaly comparing and contrasting christians and non- believers. I would not recommend this for just anyone, def would not recommend to unbeleivers or someone who is searching. The tone of the book was just a little too righteous for me."
4,ok,"trying to get life togeter and see what the end will be, while getting help for the here and now- haven't read it but if I need to, it's good to know I can have a starting point to life after divorce"
4,Good,Book in good shape. Rec'd promptly. Author is above avg.Includes devotional. etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc
3,It's okay in some aspects.,Some of his concepts are based on his opinion alone without back up or proof. And some of the counsel is pretty good and logical.
1,misleading series number,"The 3000 series isn't what it's cracked up to be. It doesn't fit the 3825 Braun razor I have, although the online ad indicated it would. Worse, after opening it to check I'm told it can't be returned. Totally useless and frustrating purchase."
1,Didn't fit the Braun,Wrong screen for my shaver. The price was low but the information online was weak about which shavers the screen would fit.
1,this is not what I oredred,Amazon recently changed the picture of this product.I ordered it based on the old picture and had to return it and take a loss.
4,Songs of Faith,"Gary Oliver has a wonderful voice, great delivery with feeling. Sorry I could only find one album by him. He needs to be heard. Saw him on an old DVD published by Tyscott Records singing Everybody Praise the Lord. I would love to have a copy of that song."
1,Cancer Story,"This book is poorly written. It does tell Jason winters story, but you can read the same stuff on his web site. Save your money."
1,Another fairy tale to sell his TEA,"Jason Winters wrote this book about how this ""Miraculous"" discovery saved him from TERMINAL CANCER.Too bad this same ""Miraculous"" tea didn't help my sister one iota, she recently died of terminal Esophagus cancer.Sadly we bought this tea out of desperation after reading his book. It tastes like nothing, really.....and it does NOTHING.There is hardly any of the herbs advertised on the tea box in the actual tea leaves.What a shame."
5,Loved the book and the tea,I enjoyed reading it and admire the devotion of the family with Jason's struggle as he tried to find holistic help for his cancer.
2,Not worth buying for parents,"I thought the title was misleading by including ""parents."" While I suppose any concept about teaching and motivating students in general can be applied by parents who want to inspire and motivate their children, I do not think this book is useful for parents. Most, if not all, of the anecdotes pertain to his classroom experiences, and his points are general in scope (as others have asserted), so it leaves parents, or at least this one, scratching their heads as to how to actually apply his ideas.I think there are definitely books out there more specifically geared for parents. And I also think the author and publisher should delete ""parents"" from the title if they cared at all about being accurate. I'm not holding my breath, though."
3,Common Sense Ideas from a Guy Who's an Entertainer More Than a Teacher,"This rather dull book is supposed to inspire teachers. Instead the author uses most of it to brag about himself and comes up with little more than common sense advice in dealing with students.His ""11"" in the title include such ""innovative"" topics as ""enthusiasm,"" ""creativity"" and ""compassion."" Most of what Clark says has been said hundreds of times before and the only reason to read the book is that he does give some of his own classroom examples that some teachers may want to adopt.The biggest problem is that this guy has convinced himself that he is incredible--and he never lets the reader forget that. He doesn't talk much about his mistakes or what led him to create some of his classroom ""games,"" but he does seem to have the philosophy that his job in the classroom is to entertain while educating. He glosses over some very serious issues and in the end is rather unconvincing in regards to his own amazing abilities."
3,Excellent 11,"I, personally, didn't find this book as useful or motivating as Ron's earlier book. It was OK - nothing new really."
5,Lessons for teachers.,We are trying to get an Alternative High School up and running again and I wish we could clone Mr. Clark to teach all students. The next best thing is to have all of our teachers read and follow his map to help our students achieve success.
4,Very Good Resource,"The Excellent 11 is a wonderful resource for teachers and parents. While it seems like a low-budget sequel to The Essential 55, it does have several nuggets of information that are beneficial to the reader. I especially like the anecdotes about his experiences. It is a truly inspiring book. Ron Clark's writing style is homey and comfortable for all types of readers.That said, it is an easy read and enjoyable. As a teacher, I look for ideas to incorporate into the classroom (high school) to make the students more responsive, resonsible, and interested in their individual education. Mr. Clark is full of ideas that work. So often teachers are given the idea du jour, which ends up be a recycled fad from the past that didn't work then and won't work now.I highly recommend this book for all teachers (and parents) that are interested in educating children."
4,Down to Earth Christianity,"Lauren Winner creates a compilation of interesting and practical Jewish traditions that have inherent applicability to Christianity. Each chapter combines interesting personal experiences with basic truths and Scripture.My only complaint is that each eleven chapters relatively stand alone from each other with little continuity between. However, most all of these sections are relatively strong in their stand-alone format."
1,I never got the book,"I would have loved to have read this book. Winner is one of my fave authors. Unfortunately, I never received the book."
1,Too slow for my two-year-old.,"My two-year-old is already adept with a mouse and enjoys games like ""Blue's Birthday"" and ""Sesame Street Letters."" The slow pace of this game, long narrations, and the fact that he only has to scroll-over pictures and not click on them are very frustrating to him. He really wants to play with Pooh, but it just makes him angry.I was especially disapointed with the foreign language section. Instead of using a total-immersion method such as introducing a new friend who speaks to children only in the foreign language, Rabbit operates a translator machine. Words go in in English and come out (quite a while later) in Spanish. No explanation is given, and the child is left wondering why Rabbit is using nonsense words.I don't recommend this to any child with computer abilities. They will find it boring at best, frustrating at worst."
3,Counselor,"This software is good for a toddlers' first game, since they don't have to use the mouse to click on much. However, it is very limited. Too much talking and not enough action. She gets bored with it easily. Reader Rabbit holds her interest much more, and it has more games."
3,"I don't like it, but the kids do","This toddler game is too limited for my liking, of the 5 areas to explore only one is any good, and even that has limited appeal. I would go for Jump Start, or Reader Rabbit first for Toddlers.However, for some reason my kids keep asking for this game and we do have a number of other toddler and pre school games, that is why I give it 3 stars(and not less).An example of why Jump Start is better is that there are at least two levels which change each game, and a song in each area, and there are about 8 areas. Much more value for money."
1,Shallow,My 2 year old is just starting out on the computer. We have been *very* happy with most toddler software we have tried such as Reader Rabbit and Jumpstart. This software was our first big let down. There are only a handful of activities on this disc and each one is pretty dull with little educational or interactive value. Would not recommend.
1,Should be No Stars,"But there isn't such a rating. I have a lot of games and tons of software for my PC. So, why does this software crash my computer every time I attempt to install and run it? There is supposedly a fix on a Disney software site, but nothing has made it work so far. I'm an experienced PC user over many years now. Software produced by Disney (or anybody for that matter) should come out of the box ready to work. The box says it will work with WinXP, so it should. It doesn't. I am very disappointed since my daughter would love learning with Pooh Bear."
5,Chivalry and Medieval Romance at it's Best,"This is a very relaxing yet thought-provoking allegory of life and love, but primarily love. I first heard of it in the film ""Shadowlands"", about the great C.S. Lewis. After having bought it and read it after hearing Anthony Hopkins describe it to his character's Oxford students in the film, I see it's significance in both that particular film and as a remarkable work of literature which, in it's day, seemed to have been far more popular than even the ""Canterbury Tales""; more than twice as many original manuscripts of RotR exist today than of ""Canterbury"". The Romance of the Rose is fluid, metaphorical, philosophical, lyric and, of course, very romantic. An exquisite illustration of courtly love."
4,rosa,I really like this book because it is a romance book and i love all romance books. I really like books that are writen in the old ages. I think if a person likes to just read books they should read Romance of the Rose.
4,Matanle's Classic SLRs Captures the Tools,"Matanle's ""Collecting and Using Classic SLRs"" is amust own for every SLR camera collector. His camera close ups, as wellas specs, prove he knows his material. He provides abundant information on cameras A to Z. His shots of cameras are crystal clear; however, photos from his personal collection are somewhat hazy and appear out of place. Book is still worth the money..."
5,A Magnificent Book on Cameras and Lenses,"When I first read Ivor Matanle a few years ago I had never heard of this Englishman who writes so beautifully about cameras and lenses.This book covers single lens cameras in several formats,rather than just 35mm. He has used the equipment he describes, and writes as well as a fine novelist. He gives the history of SLR's and tells about the rise of Asian cameras as Europe abandons innovation in design. But he plays no favorites.All cameras are treated fairly.This is a book you will marvel at, if you are a user or a collector. Read it once; refer to it often. But above all, enjoy it and marvel at how well he writes.With nearly 400 fine photos of equipment and pictures taken with these cameras, the book is a smorgasbord of information.If I lost this book, I would drive 500 miles to replace it!"
3,"A companion to ""Collecting and Using Classic Cameras""","This book is a companion edition to Mantale's earlier ""Collecting and Using Classic Cameras."" As such it duplicates many of the strengths and weaknesses of the earlier volume.The equipment discussed covers a wide range of European and Japanese cameras. As with its companion edition, it is sadly lacking in information concerning American made equipment.Mantale offers a lot of opinion, but the opinion tends to be of superficial nature. The book is profusely illustrated with ""enthusiastic amateur"" quality photographs.In summary: useful in breadth to a begining camera collector, disappointing in depth to the more serious collector. Caveat reader."
5,Kafka's Absurd America,"Franz Kafka could be a very funny writer. Amerika shows him at his most poignantly absurd.This book also gives a key to seeing the humor which runs just under the surface in his ""serious"" novels, The Trial and The Castle.Kafka's Amerika resembles the writing of John Dos Passos or Woody Guthrie - a rambling, disjointed narrative told in deceptively simple prose. What Kafka adds is a an absurd undercurrent that swells as the book progresses.Amerika should stand with his other two novels as monuments to his genius."
5,Spellings,I'd like to point ut to those who critocized Kafka's spelling of America that country spellings are actually different depending on where your from. If you read about where Kafka was from and look on a map you'll see it spelled as Prague. However if you go to Prague and look on one of their maps they actually spell it Praha. Therefore we are just as guilty.
2,Unfinished First Novel,"This novel was unfinished and needed some cleaning up. We never learn how he comes to leave Robinson and Delamarche, for instance, or whatever becomes of his money the manageress is holding for him. It is obvious that the work was not ready for publication. That said, for those who are interested in reading Kafka the book is light and amusing at times. But overall, the situations Karl finds himself in are often frustratingly impossible and the characters are not well developed. Karl, the main character makes an excellent argument for the Stoker in Chapter One, but can't seem to find words for his own defense at the Hotel. There are enough inconsistancies to drive an analytical reader crazy and probably Kafka wouldn't have allowed publication in this unfinished form."
2,They've all come to look for America....,"Franz Kafka's 'Amerika' started off, to me, with a great premise, but in the end I found the tale less than entertaining.Karl Rossman, a teenage boy shipped off to America by his parents following an 'indiscretion' with a servant girl, finds himself in the company of an American uncle, who quickly shuns him for accepting the hospitality of one of the uncle's friends.Rossman then 'disappears' into the poor working class landscape of America, where he encounters many less than scrupulous characters.Much of this novel is devoted to the this 'disappearance', though the action, to me, never quite moved along...and made the story quite stale to me...While I have not read any other works by Franz Kafka, I hope that other novels were better paced and executed. His prose is enjoyable, just not very 'lively' in this offering."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I use the Sacred Fire oil by this company and loved it. This product had a serious unnatural perfume quality that I could not stand. I choose natural products to avoid the cosmetics counter smell, but this one was just off. I tried it twice. Will have to give it away."
5,FINALLY - A Korean classic - REMASTERED!,"Been waiting a very long time for this. HOUSEMAID is ""the"" classic Korean film. Its the most famous film in Korean movie history. For a long time, chunks of the film were lost and no good print existed. Apparently the World Cinema Foundation assisted the Korean Film Archives in painstakingly remastering this film. It took a lot of time, and cost a ton of money, but this DVD is the end result. This is such an amazing film, that it recently was remade in 2010, and even the remake (Amazon carries it) was screened at Cannes in 2010. If you want to see a true classic of cinema, check out this film. This DVD is absolutely excellent quality. And yes, it will play in the USA."
5,"Received my charger as promised, saved over $20.","I'm from Canada. I misplaced my charger and the local electronic stores wanted $30-$40 for it. I ordered from BargainCell, through Amazon and saved over $20.If you are looking to get a new charger or battery for your electronic gadgets, I recommend getting the OEM ones, as people have died from explosions due to non-OEM equipment batteries and chargers."
5,Great Price,"My husband ""lost"" his charger and needed a new one in a hurry. Price good and received quickly."
3,Cancer book,Okay and honest memoir as far as cancer books go. I'm happy to see some lymphoma books out there and only wished Gifford would've told more about how she handled her loss of fertility.
1,Blank Book,This was supposed to be a book of poetry and drawings. Not one drawing . 95% of the book was blank!
3,Go Faith!!!,"Faith Evans is a beautiful singer..I love her music, but when I brought this album I was like okayy...I completely fell in love with her song ""Again"" & since I'm a fan I brought the cd..I didn't care for it at first, but it grew on me..I really only like about two or three tracks off the album..I thought she could have did better, but I'm not really disappointed cause the album actually did grow on me..I'm just glad that shes's back..So if you a fan of Faith get her album you may not like it right off, but I know for a fact it will grow on you cause it did for me."
4,Love It,"I love the heavy bass combined with the synths on ""Goin' Out"" - it's just the one to play whilst your getting ready to go out with the girls. ""Again"" is a mellow one and suits Faith Evan's sweet husky voice a lot. These are my favourite songs on this album but the whole album is very listenable."
4,...,"Faith must have had quite a bit of pressure on her after an album instantly declared as her best ever, Faithfully. While this album is not as great as that album, it is still very nice. Her vocals are great, and so is the production and songwriting. The first eight tracks or so are all excellent. At the end, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. The best tracks are ""Again,"" ""Mesmerize,"" and ""Tru Love."" I recommend buying this album."
3,Premature Release,"I received the new Faith CD for Mother's Day and I really appreciate that my kids know what I like aside from Jazz and Blues (which comes first). I love ""Again"" because it hit the spot. Convincing, captivating and relative. The rest of the cd doesn't really grab me. It's missing FAITH. The collaborations aren't versatile. Faith is a very good writer however, this does not deliver for me. The direction of the cd is uncertain. Again, I love and appreciate Faith, but this product should've baked a little longer."
3,Maybe I missed it,"I was just reading all of the reviews for this album and I am truly amazed to what it is the listeners are hearing. Don't get me wrong I love faith and my all time favorite album by her is ""Faithfully"" but this album is not nearly what I expected. The best song by far is the single that is already in circulation Again. I am use to Faith bringing it and First Lady is not to me a true example of her full potential. On this album there are about four good hits out of thirteen unfortunately this percentage does not equal a great cd just an ok attempt ( Sorry Faith you are still my girl but I expected more)"
2,"""Liked Big Faith Better""","I tried to listen to the whole CD but I kept skipping through tracks. I was totally disappointed with her CD. I mean, Faith's my girl and she can blow. I just don't know what happen with this one. She needs P.Diddy - Help Her Diddy Please! lol"
4,"FAITH, THE FIRST LADY","I would hear Faith music on the radio but never purchased any of her music until now. After listening to her CD I am a fan, not only because the songs have meaning but she wrote most of the songs. I love orginial music and admire when an artist writes their own music. LOVED IT. Ms. K"
2,First Lady.....Hopefully Last album,"I'm not feelin' it really at all. Couple of songs are worth listening to such as ""Again"", and ""True Love"". There is something major missing on this album, and that might just be good songs! I know she could have came way better than this, comparing it to her past cds. To me it didn't showcase her true potential and its just a bunch of filler songs with not much that stands out. Close to the worst album I have bought in the past 6 months."
2,"I hate to do this,but","these 2 stars represent the only 2 songs I like on this cd.Faith you are a great vocalist,but I wanted you to take it a step up as far as your vocals.This material does not allow you to show what you can really do.I know alot of people like the little sing along songs,but some of us like the real singing on the cd.Faith is like the Karen Clark Sheard of r&b to me,but this cd did not do it for me at all.I hope you put out a gospel cd that way you she can let loose on music."
4,For the Grown and Sexy,"This album is definitely for the grown and sexy. As a HUGE Faith Evans fan, I have loved her from ""You Used to Love Me' and it's a pleasure to see her grow to the woman she is now. Her lyrics tell of a more adult, confident woman, and I love it. My only gripe is at thirteen tracks, it's way too short. In heavy rotation for me is ""Catching Feelings"", and ""Goin' Out"". The beats have an old school sound to them, and her vocal range is more limited on this album than the others. She's happy with her husband, kids, and new life in LA, and it shows. The only dud on the CD is the song with Mario Winans, other than that, this is a classic. Better than ""Faithfully"". It's a must have for the summer!"
4,forget tweet,go get this album instead because this one has better songs. since tweet's album got boring and tired. but this one however really did hit the spot. and the best song from this album is hope.
5,A Keeper!!!!,I was surprised that it got bad reviews! This is the first album by Faith Evans that I got. I love it dearly! She is wonderful. Tru Love is my favorite track!
2,What happened here??,"I've been a huge Faith fan every since she came out! Her music & past CD's has always been wonderful....until this one. Not to exspress my age, but it's grown folks music. I mean really grown, I bought it, opened it, played it, then gave it to my mama. Her older stuff wasn't like this, this is really funky, & repetitious . Where's the deep bass romantic ballads, the lovers hooks, and the hip hop cameo's? I think maybe she wanted to attrack a different type of audience? Or maybe try something totally different? Sorry Faith, but it didn't work this time. Either keep trying, or go back to what kept you rich, before you go broke..."
1,bad packaging,i was very surprised when i opened this cd. the case was broken and had a huge scratch on the top of it. i order many cd's from this web site and this is the 1st time that ever happened to me. the cd in it self was great but the case gets a big fat 0000
2,very average,"Faith Evans can sing&has feeling in her voice,but I have always felt that One decent Disc worth of Her Greatest Hits would speak enough about Her. Her Albums have always beent he same.She never gets enough depth Lyrically&the Production can be Hit&Miss.She was the Link Between Mary J.Bliege&Jennifer Lopez in Puffy's Musical Landscape&this is where it gets crazy. She is a better Vocalist than Both,but She lacks Mary's Emotion,Feeling&Vibe to Connect. she lacks J-Lo's ability at connecting on a Groove. Faith isn't a Robotic Artist but She also at times lacks Musical personality which makes Her better served at doing Hooks for other Artists or Writing as to her own stuff. she is gonna be One of those Artists that will have a Pretty Good Run,but never reaches Her full Musical Potential because alot of what she does is cool for the Moment but it doesn't have enough Personality.this Album suffers that same no Pun Intended Faith. I dig ""Again"" but there isn't enough to really build on."
3,"If I could go 2.5 stars, I would.....","After such a long hiatus I expected SO much more from Faith. The songs on here seem to be so drab, jazzy and her voice does not sound as good as it once was. I don't think there is anything she can do that would come close to her 1995 debut and with this latest effort, it falls WAY TOO short! The first single: ""Again"" really had to grow on me. I did not like it at first - at all. But now I am feeling it. Most of the songs have the same arrangements and the same melodies to them which makes it sound like one long song (especially the slower songs). She took more of a jazzy Jill Scott/Angie Stone approach to her sound....which is not HER sound. I expected more beats, maybe more guests, more catchy hooks and less Beyonce'-esque vocals in the song: ""Mesmerized"". Once upon a time I would have agreed with the CD title of The First Lady....but not with these plain songs."
4,I CAN'T STOP!!!!!,"LISTENING TO TRACKS #3-I DON'T NEED IT, #4-STOP N GO(SO REFRESHING), #5=MESMERIZED AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER GEMS HERE BUT THOSE SONGS CAN BE PLAYED ON REPEAT BY ME FOR HOURS...BUT PEEP IT OUT YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!!!!"
4,It's Growing On Me,When I first heard this album I blasted it for being horrible--but as time goes on it really has grown on me. I have to repent and say this album isnt the best but it is a good listen if your in the mood and you like Faith.
4,"Good CD, Prefer It Than Tweets.","Very Good project, been waiting for this breath of fresh air...Tweets does kind of get a lil boring after a few spins, but then again she just does not have the vocal capabilities that Faith has. Faith is just a stronger vocalist than tweet, so really no comparison. Tweet is ok, Faith is Better, Much Better. Go Get It and add to your collection today."
2,Worse Faith Evans album ever!,"This review is coming from a person who LOVES Faith Evans' music. This CD was a departure from the smooth style that everyone came to know and love from Faith. Only three songs on the CD are worth downloading, but I wouldn't buy the entire album, unless I found it really cheap. The good songs from this CD are ""True love,"" ""Again"" and ""Hopeful,"" which is actually really Twista's song, and was out for nearly a year before Faith's CD came out. ""Mesmorized"" it okay, but the remix with Nas, which is the better version, isn't on the CD. Instead, they have some hyper sounding dance remix, which is worse than the original. All the other songs sound like they should be on the soundtrack to some late 70's or early 80's movie."
1,Don't waste your money!,HORRIBLE!! DONT waste your money... Somebody should tell Faith to stick to ballads. This album is boring and very very LAME and has no substance.
2,A little far fetched,"This book is a little out there. Like, these situations would never happen. Not at all realistic. Somewhat entertaining, but it took me some time to get thru it. Boredom set in after a while."
5,Blind Dating Can Work...If you read this!,These 3 ladies know how to write. I especially liked Lisa Watson's story. Lisa brings her charaters to life and draws you into the story.
2,LinKsys Voice Router review,"Not too happy. It turns out that my unit was returned by a previous customer, who had already activated the account. This has caused untold confusion, and guess what, customer service are completely incapable of solving this rather extraordinary set of circumstances. Ended up with some other customer running up bills on my credit card!Why can't Net2Phone and LinkSys build some decent echo cancellers? Neither the network side, nor the CPE side has decent echo cancellation. Not acceptable."
4,Great product could be better,"The only thing keeping me from giving this product 5 stars is its non-existant Macintosh support. Linksys could invest maybe another *day* of someone's time and support Macintosh computers with this product. Since I'm multiplatform, I was able to configure it using a PC...If you want to use MAC address spoofing to have the Linksys present a particular MAC address to the cable company, you will need to do a firmware update to add the feature. This was not a big deal, but it is an extra step.The Net2Phone feature works as advertised and seems to be of reasonably high audio quality. It's sort of like being on a cordless instead of a wired phone. Hook a cordless to it and have twice the fun!"
3,10 Things I Hate About You,"Is it because of my endless watching of this comedies movie adaption, 10 Things I Hate About You, or this book was very easy to comprehend. I have never found Shakespeare terribly difficult to understand and this was enjoyable.A play within a play, this comedy was engaging and quite different than his other comedies. This play, I found foreshadowed his latter dark comedies including Romeo and Juliet and MacBeth.I liked Katherine and the way she interacted with her suitors. For a lady of that time, I found this to be very bold behaviour and brave. Bianca, a sweet thing, I pity in some respects in the way she was catered to. These two sisters no doubt has misery towards one another but also, it was obvious they had love and respect for one another. If not jelousy of each others lives.The humour of the book bumped up my rating, otherwise it would be at a mere 3/3.5. Not my favourite Shakespeare comedy but, still one that is enjoyable and a fun read."
1,what the hell,I didn't really like this book but i would just like to ask the guy from the Netherlands what the hell book he was reading coz it sure wasn't the same as mine.
1,Taming Of The Shrew,"I found this story to be extremely elementary. This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future."
4,The Taming of the Shrew,"The Taming of the Shrew is a play within a play. It starts out with a drunkard, Sly, and a lord. The lord bets that he can trick Sly into thinking he is a lord. When Sly wakes up he doesn't understand, but eventually accepts who they say he is. After a few minutes he becomes bored and the play, ""Taming of the Shrew"" comes on. It is a play that has men dressing as women, other men, and women dressing as men. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a book that will have a geat beginning, middle, end, and will keep you wanting to read the next page."
4,Shrew Review,"The Taming of the Shrew is a great read for high school literature classes. Shakespeare uses love in this play to set up many comical situations. It is a nice change of pace from the traditional Shakespearian love tragedy which we have all been subjected to. This book is easily related to by teens. I personally related to the two suitors for Bianca. They both wanted her more than anything and were forced to wait because of a shrewd sister and an overbearing father. This was one book that I had no problem sitting down, reading, and enjoying on my own time. This book is a necesity for all high school literature classes."
2,read Hamlet instead,"well, if you have nothing at all to do, and you like Shakespeare in general, and you can get over the nauseated feeling the last act gives you, I suppose this book isnt that bad. Otherwise, forget it."
3,A Heart-Wrenching and Depressing Novel,"Set in the bleak, industrial land of Airstrip One, this play by Wilem Shapear made tell the tale of Simeon the tailor, struggling to get by with a family of six and a 12 shilling a week income. Although overly depressing at times, the Taming of the Shrew is a chilling and relevant reminder of how sometimes the stock market bubble can burst and todays rags to riches stock market stories may someday reverse. Servo me, ardeo! Non solvere possum id."
2,taming of the shrew,"Ididn't read this book to the end, because I didn't undrestand, so i'm trying to find a good translated book. But i think it's a comic and good book"
5,Cliffs Noted to the rescue!,"Once again, Cliffs Notes have saved me from the thick language of William Shakespeare. This, like the others gives a nice explanation of the characters, the seperate scenes as well as acts, and worry not, it is in the language the YOU understand! There are essay questions in the back that help you really think about the book. I don't know what I would have done with out this! It's great!"
4,One of the First Ladies of CCM,"Originally released in 1987, this was Debby Boone's final contemporary Christian music (CCM) album comprised of all new material. (It was followed in 1988 by ""Reflections,"" a best-of compilation, and in 1989 by ""Be Thou My Vision,"" a collection of hymns.) Memorable songs from this disc include the title track, ""Be Ye Glad,"" ""To Every Generation,"" and ""Sincerely Yours,"" which was written by Amy Grant's ex, Gary Chapman. It's a shame Debby is no longer involved in the Christian music industry. She, like Amy Grant and Sandi Patty, was one of the leading female pioneers of the genre in the late 70s and throughout the 80s. I hope one day she returns."
3,should be remastered,"I had the cassette way back when it first came out and wanted to upgrade to the cd. Please note that the cd is not remastered. It does not play at the same volume as newer cd's. If you only listen to this cd then turn the volume up. But if you play it with a collection of other new cd's then you will have to adjust the volume between cd's. 3 stars due to volume/mastering.However, this album is excellent and Debby's voice is clear and on target. The songs truly minister to the soul. If it weren't for the volume/mastering then I would give it 5 stars!"
3,Cute but does not fit...,"I have a miniature pinscher puppy and thought the X-small would be fine for her, but it is way too big! MAYBE when she is full grown she will fit it but I very much doubt it... It is a very cute shirt though. Guess I'll have to keep making my socks into shirts for her until I can find SOMETHING that fits right..."
1,Doesn't work,Cable does not come with software and drivers were impossible for me to find. Sellers website offers no help. Can't get it to work. This has been a problem with knockoff cables for some time I now find out. Search the web and you will find many discussions with many people who have found out the same. Spend a little more money and research the product before purchase to see if it works. Wish I did.
1,Defective,"After going out and getting the drivers (which were not provided), the device still would not work. When I attempted to remove the device from the USB port, the cable smoothly detached from the USB connector, leaving the connector in my USB port."
5,An essential tool for the armchair lunar astronomer,"I thoroughly recommend Antonin Rukl's Atlas of the Moon. I have used it together with the Consolidated Lunar Atlas, published by the Lunar and Planetary Institute.The Atlas allows the armchair astronomer to locate sites on the moon and to relate them to photographs. The images (drawings) are accurate enough.It also lists the sites of all the lunar landings American and Russian."
4,An absolute must for anyone with a telescope,"This is the only atlas I have found with enough detail to suit telescope users. Not only does it show all of the area you can see from Earth, it also lets you know who the people were that each feature was named after."
5,Can't do better than Rukl,I've long borrowed this from the library while I looked for something better to be available in the market. Turns out there isn't a better lunar atlas so I bought my own copy.
3,works if you take it and do what it tells you to do..,"I bought this book for a friend, and got one for myself directly from Dr. Emmett. I was very impressed with him as a dentist, so that made me interested in his book. He really does live this life as does his wife. I think the book gives you excellent examples to live by to alter and change your life to one that is healther."
3,A classic in lousy copy,"I read the wonderful book ""The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut : The Rise of Mathematical Science in Eighteenth-Century Paris and the Fall of 'Normal' Science "" by Greenberg and thought it a good idea to read the old classic by Todhunter. I was very glad to find the volumes back in print and ordered both volumes. Well, good to have them, but ... The pages of the book look as if mediocre xerox technique was used to produce photocopies. You can even see xeroxed fuzzes on some pages! The binding is miles away from former Dover paperbacks (it seems to be glued together) so that I fear opening the pages too much. I one word: This is not what I would understand being a ""reprint""."
4,Neo-soul saves the live-long day....,"Like the best of her neo-soul sisters Ellee Ven and Lina, Vivian Green maintains a uniquely ethnic sound within a beautiful pastiche of trancy r&b and danceable balladry. Witness ""Damn,"" as fine a melody as ever left the lips of any classic songstress! I'm saving 5 stars for her third CD. Cyndi Lauper really knows her singers, by the way- she duets with Vivian on TWO songs on her new CD, ""The Body Acoustic""!"
4,Green's Day.,"It ain't easy being Green, and on Vivian's second album, she takes us through a rollercoaster ride of many moods and emotions. She leans away from her so-called nu soul roots and dabbles a bit with radio r&b, but does this mean she's sold out? I'd hesitate to rush to that judgement, but ""Vivian"" is solid enough to make it a worthy followup. ""Under My Skin"" and ""Frustrated"" are title-says-it-all jams that explore the turbulent nature of relationships, and the same can be said for the single ""Gotta Go Gotta Leave (Tired)"" and the opener ""Wish We Could Go Back."" But it ain't all gloom and doom. The mood does perk up on more upbeat tracks on ""Sweet Thing"" and ""All About Us."" But the album's most impressive quality is Vivian's voice, which is strong enough to redeem the album's sometimes-trite lyrics. Still, in an age where vapid, video artist beauties are the norm, ""Vivian"" is a nice alternative. Go check it out."
3,Debut better than sophomore,"I expected much more from Vivian's second album but I was disappointed...The music was good, but it just wasn't the sound that I was expecting to hear."
3,Good Music,"This is a nice CD & Vivian Green has a nice voice. She sings from within. I like her, this was my first time purchasing something by her, and I was not dissapointed. Better than her first CD I think."
4,Great tumblers but unforgiving on a tile floor,I have had these tumblers for about 2 years and they are still beautiful. Be warned though that if dropped onto a tile floor they will break. We have had 3 such mishaps. I recommend them highly because they stand up so well to the dishwasher.
5,Best plasticware ever!!!,"I have these tumblers in both the 14 oz. and 8 oz. sizes and they are wonderful! Look as new as the day I bought them and have been used and washed in dishwasher for over 2 years. Bright, fun colors. Kids and adults both love them. Also have bowls in matching colors. Wanted to get the plates but waited too long and now they are not available. Please have Zak Designs re-supply! Worth every penny!"
5,Great quality!,"Bright colors, VERY hardy plastic that hasn't faded under many washings and spills on the tile floor. Good to note the not huge size - I find it just right for guests, indoors and outside. Would buy again."
3,Good source of information,This book is very helpful if you are doing a term paper on John Ernst Steinbeck. The book gives you well needed information in the first few pages. INformation on dates when books were released his marriages everything you could want to know about Mr. Steinbeck. Did me wel and I am sure it will do you well.
2,Save your money. Check it out if you want to read it.,"I really was disappointed in this book. The characters were not developed at all. The author did a lot of telling and no showing. We are asked to believe a lot of things, with no reasons to believe them. I gave it 2 stars because it deals with death. The reversal is not earned. I wouldn't suggest that anyone purchase this book."
1,"May dies, Ob and Summer cry, wa wa, THE END","Was this supposed to be a touching book? Please let me know. May died before the book even started, so we didn't even get to know her. And then we were supposed to feel sorry for Summer? She spent the book crying and talking about how odd Cletus was. Cletus, at least, had a hobby. Yes, I have experienced death, and I still don't get MISSING MAY. Yeah, everyone grieves differently, I know, but that doesn't mean Cynthia Rylant had to let her characters mope around dismally. If you do want to read a book that deals well with death, and there are a lot of them out there, I recommend you stear clear of Cynthia Rylant."
1,Disappointing.,"I expect much better things from a Newbery-award winner. Nothing much seemed to actually HAPPEN, they just thought about things and talked. Maybe I would have liked it better if I had had someone I know die, but I haven't and this book was not interesting to me. I kept expecting something to happen soon but then I realized I was on the last few pages and it was still nothing. Please take my advice because I read a lot and I know about books. Even if you still want to read it, check it out from the library because it's too short to be worth the money. For a GOOD book about death, I reccommend WALK TWO MOONS. The author makes it funny, interesting and sad at the same time. I am 14 years old."
3,Missing May is O.K.,"Missing May is O.K. It's about a little girl that moves in with her aunt and uncle. She is filled with warmness when she sees how much they love each other. Her uncle, Ob, is heart-broken when her aunt, May, dies. They live in a trailer in the moutains. It's a peaceful little place; but not for long. Summer, th little girl, grieves with Ob over the death of May.Cletus, a person Summer goes to school with, helps to ease the pain. He and Ob believe that May is with them, but in a different way than you might think. They believe that May was literaly with them in the garden for a moment, even though she wasn't visible.That part sparked my interet in the book as I read it. They began a search for a way to contact May as they drove across the country.Missing May has lots of mixed emotions. In general, I would say that it is a good book to read if you are looking for something to do, but can't find anything."
3,Something Is Missing,"This book was a Newbery winner, and Cynthia Rylant is an excellent writer, but for me this book kind of falls flat. Something -- some rich element of plot, perhaps -- is missing. The story, about twelve-year-old Summer, who lives with her Aunt May and Uncle Ob, centers around how much Summer and Ob miss May, who has died just before the start of the novel. The story is warm and heartfelt, the characters sympathetic as they learn to cope with their loss, but the book seems not substantial enough to stand as a novel."
4,what I think about missing may,"What I think about Missing MayI think the book Missing May was a very good book it is meaningful and gives a meaningful message. It's about ob and May and the grand daughter who has lost may their grandmother. But I would also a it is a mature book and is not for a 8-9 year old its more for 10 through 12.I give this book a rating of 4 stars. I recommend this book to any one over the age of 10, great book"
1,How did THIS book get an award?,"Yeah, 1 star may be harsh, but that's what this book truely deserves. The story was, to put bluntly, dull and boring. I had a hard time getting past the 2nd chapter. I had to read this for school, and like many other students, we kept nagging our teacher about how great this book is and about how we wish we could read it again (as if she would waste school time doing that). Ah, the art of sucking up for a good grade.Now even if the story was bad, the length or content's writing style could have been better to keep us interested. But alas, the whole book failed our 6th grade readers, my fellow classmates.Teachers, don't be fooled by this book's cover with the metal plastered on, there are other more arousing and worthy novels out there to spend your time on."
3,I just finished this book and it was touching,If you are looking for a sad and weird book get Missing May. This book will touch your heart and almost make you cry. When you hear about this boy you will almost laugh at him. Also you will meet a heartbroken old man who just lost his wife and a girl who tries to cheer him up. Read to see if this girl cheers this heartbroken old man up before he gives his life up.
4,Missing May by Cynthia Rylant,"The book Missing May was about a girl named Summer. When she was a little girl her parents died. She was passed from relative to relative. Nobody wanted her until Uncle Ob and Aunt May took Summer home. When six years went by Aunt May died. Ob and Summer couldn't get over her death. Summer was afraid something was going to happen to her Uncle Ob. Ob said, he always heard May's spirit from the day May died. Summer and Ob will never forget May. They both realized that they have to get on with their life and not dwell in the past."
5,Wonderfully written!,The characters were lovable and sometimes quirky. The story was moving but hopeful. I loved this book!
5,Don't Miss out on Missing May!,"This book is actually for preteens but I was required to read it for a class. I loved it so much I ended up rereading it with my 10-year-old son. This book is an amazing story and teaches lots of life lessons.It is about dealing with grief, treasuring life and making unexpected friends."
3,horrible death missing may,"I recommend this book to boys and girls. This is a situation that is pretty common. Having someone die in your family is very upsetting. If this situation ever happened to you this book would be good for you because, then you could relate this story to yourself. I also recommend this book because; it is very interesting how this family lives after this tragedy. I would like to read another book by this author because, she is very descriptive. I enjoyed this style of writing because,the author is very specific and worded the story very well and it was easy to understand. No, this book wasn't a page-turner but it made me kind of anxious at some parts but it was mostly at a slow pase. The plot was really believable and this could have really happened. I actually know someone that this situation has happened to them. That is what I think of Missing May."
4,A Wonderful Read,"This book was a wonderful novel full of spirit and hope. It teaches you to keep your head up high and if one thing doesn't go your way, don't stop what you're doing, still continue your life. Life will eventually get better if you do the right thing. If you like emotional stories you will love this.It is kind of sad and if you are someone who cries over small things you'll probably cry for this. It was a great story that you'll learn a lot of lessons from and the most important one I've learned was to listen to your heart, like OB and Summer, who didn't stop moving on even thought they were ""Missing May""."
1,A truly Pitiful Story,"The story was so sad and the characters were so emotionally unstable that I felt like laughing at them for being so reminescent. The lady died, the end...that's life...just keep on living. I hated how the characters were feeling sorry for themselves 24/7. This book was way to fluffy, even for me."
1,NO STARS! THE WORST BOOK EVER!,"This is the umpteenth time I'm giving a review for Missing May because the rest weren't shown in the Customer Reviews section. I absolutely hated this book. Lifeless characters, a boring plot. The author should be embarrassed of having written such a horrendous piece of trash. The Newbery Medal was wasted on this thing. What is wrong with the committee who picks the Newbery books? The Newbery books are supposed to be nice books for children. If this is nice, I wouldn't want to know what bad is."
1,Adults consider it a great read for kids. Kids..don't.,"It seems that no one but adults liked this book. The kids or young adults thought it--well lets just say that most would recommend it only to someone who was either eight years old, or someone who was was hated and in need of sufficient torture. Adults, it seems to me that you guys probably didn't like it so much, but thought that kids would like it. And it is the neverending tradition of adults to think kids to be younger and dumber than they really are. This book will be enjoyable to kids? Maybe eight year olds and six year olds will like it, but certainly no one older. Kids, pick your own books and take a good look at the adult recommended books before reading them. My review probably won't do anything to stop you from reading it. The reviews didn't for me. But after reading it, you'll probably choose to join the club--the ""I hate Missing May club."""
5,Beautiful and Moving,"This is such a beautiful book - and I would never have discovered it if my young teenage nephew hadn't been assigned it for a book report! (He seems to be the only person in the family that wasn't grateful.) At 87 pages, it's proof that you don't have to go on for hundreds of pages to make an unforgettable impression. I've been urging every adult I know to put this on their library queue. There is hardly a sentence out of place, the characters live and breathe, and May's death and its aftermath moved me as deeply as Matthew's death in ""Anne of Green Gables."" Mere descriptions of what this book is ""about"" do not do it justice - just read it, and you will see."
5,Beautiful!,"""Missing May"" is the most beautiful book I've ever read. I call it my ""Happy Book."" Whenever I feel sad, I read it, and it lifts my spirits. Since first reading this book several years ago, I've been searching for another book as fulfilling as ""Missing May,"" a book filled with love, hope, wonders, sadness and joy. In the back of my mind, I'm hoping Ms. Rylant will provide another book like this one for myself and others who so love ""Missing May."""
4,"This book was not easy to read, too moody and dark.","I read this book because it has been included on a list of books for a literature club my students will compete in next year. Although I found the book thought provoking, I really did not enjoy the reading of it until the end. The ending more than made up for the gloominess of the subject and the fact that I found myself wondering what was to happen to the characters in the future. I guess I need a sequel."
3,"It's a movie, as simple as that.","Mr. Majestyk is a movie that was written by Elmore Leonard (and starring Charles Bronson) which I believe was later turned into a novel. The book is pretty decent. The movie is better (that is, it watches better than the book reads). Enjoy both."
3,Novelization Passes the Time,"This brief little story started off as a screenplay commissioned by Clint Eastwood. However, when Eastwood decided to make the uberdark High Plains Drifter instead, Leonard's script got sold to someone else and was turned into a movie starring Charles Bronson in 1974. Leonard subsequently novelized the screenplay, which accounts for its relative brevity. The story is pretty basic and, upon reflection, typically ridiculous. The title character is an Vietnam special forces vet who just wants to lead a quiet life farming melons. An altercation with a small-time hood lands him in jail with a notorious hitman, and things get sillier from there, as the he struggles to get back to his melons and get them in on time. There's a subplot involving a relationship with a Latina union organizer who seems really smart and together, that is, until she goes along with his harebrained plans. As always, Leonard's prose passes the time, but only barely."
1,"Cute, but a waste of money",I bought 8 of these cards in various designs for my friends dogs and my own at Xmas. Absolutely not 1 dog was interested in this item.They are cute...but a waste of money since dogs don't like them...I tried 8 different cards with 8 different dogs. Save your money.Petco sells them for $2.99 if you wanna still waste your money.
3,I'll put 3 stars...,"...because there is 1 for Wilford Brimley (always a pleasure to watch his appearances), 1 for Lance Henriksen (who doesn't need any rehearsal for this kind of part), and 1 for John Woo whose effort to make Van Damme look like an actor is the only excuse for casting the most stupid-looking female lead I ever saw : I'm not sure if she was trying to look bewildered or else, but the intensity of the stupidity filling her eyes (especially in close-ups) should have got her some kind of reward, since I don't think it was (or could be) ever matched, except perhaps with the always reliable T(otal)V(ulgarity) products (but that I can't really tell since I NEVER had a TV set).Besides, I think Van Damme should be liable for some compensation, after stating that John Woo was ""THE Martin Scorcese of Asia"", which, in my opinion is close to some defamatory remark : there is some violence in some Scorcese's movies, but violence is NEVER the whole of the show!!!"
5,Actioned packed for action junkies,This actioned packed movie is one of Van Damme's best films that have been made. Its one of those films that you can watch over and over. I saw it at the movies and bought it as soon as it came out on DVD. Lance Henriksen is great as the evil bad guy.
3,Bad Men Rising,"I rented this film because I am a fan of director Woo. I enjoyed this film because of its heavies; Fouchon and Van Cleaf (Lance Henrickson and Arnold Vosloo). Van Damme seemed to bog down an otherwise stylish Woo picture. I am sure the script called for a Cajun hero with character and charm, yet Van Damme fails to deliver. Woo manages to create a decent action flick, even though the hero seems bored and void of cognitive thought. My God, John McClain(diehard/bruce willis)would have been more believable in this bayou hunting scenerio than Chance-what-ever-his-name-is. If I can make a suggestion - - a movie about Fouchon and Van Cleaf, that would be interesting, and certainly worth watching. Kudos to Woo, Henricksen, and Vosloo, for rising above what seems like another studio execs bad intrusion (casting a flavor of the month action star like Van Damme in the lead). Trust me, the bad guys and their director manage to salvage what they can of this Damme mess."
4,action,"I can say ""they don't make them like they use to"". Lots of of fireworks and things that go BOOM!! if you enjoy vandamme or action flicks then this a movie you should own or at least watch. Last time I saw this flick was in the early 1990's and it still hasn't been toped off by the original action scenes. comparing that today alot of computers are used. This one is old school blow things up then we'll pay the bill later type of movie, real stunt men no strings that were later erased with computers type of stuff."
4,One Of Van Damme's Best,"Hard Target is clealry of the best movies Van Damme ever made. Van Damme movies where he picked up a gun were never that good but here with the cinematography and stylish vison of John Woo, Van Damme gives a good performance still has a chance for a few karate scenes and makes one of the best action movies of the nineties. Lance Henikrsen( whose always good) and Arnold Vosloo make great bad guys. Yancy Butler is sexy as hell (even though a T&A scene would have been good.) If you 've never seen this film check it out it's one of Van Damme best and Woo's first Amercian film."
3,Surprisingly Good Van Damme?,"Was I finally impressed after watching this movie. Van Damme made me stand up and clap for once. He did a good job and John Woo will be remembered for making Van Damme seem like a good action star. Lance Henriksen is good and the stunt-work was amazing. Kudos to Van Damme, keep it going."
5,Pure Woo,"I saw this movie on the T.v) BBC1 (it's an English channel) and I taped it because I read John Woo directed it. And I was not dissapointed. It has a the poetic shoot-outs you'd expect from a Woo movie. I can't wait to see the director's cut. I heard it was out but I can't find. The end it brilliant, loads of shooting and explosions. The only bad thing is Van Damme's terrible one-liners. Lance Heriksen is excellant as ever. And Van Damme kicks a few more heads than averagly.great action movie go but it and the directors cut."
4,Van-Damme and Woo who could ask for more?,Lets get this over with this film was never intended to be or ever going to be the most thought provoking film of the decade. That sort of thing is best left to the Truman Show or Saving Private Ryan. However if you don't fell like engaging your brain then you could do a lot worse than pick this film. Granted without Woo on board this would flounder however with him this hits a high standard. Woo's moody shots and slow motion shots save the film from becoming just another mindless action film. Van-Damme is always used best when he is high kicking in firelight or flipping over cars and when the camera pans over him in the firelight you'll be totaly enthralled. The end sequence is particualy good with the charecteristic magazine dropping shot and the high kicks flying thick and fast. Like I said at the beging if you want social comment and thought provoking hire Private Ryan if you want breath taking action directed by a true master of the genre hire this.
1,Doesn't Even Deserve One Star,"This movie blows. Jean Claude Van Damme is one of the worst actors ever to grace the silver screen. I feel sorry for the people who wrote nice reviews of this film because they obviously have no standards whatsoever. How can anyone possibly overlook the atrocious slow-motion sequences? If you want a real action film, rent Dirty Harry. Poor acting, horrid directing, and silly plotlines (was there a plot?) combine to make this one of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure to see."
1,Yeesh!,"Honestly, guys, just because you think it's a stupid action movie doesn't mean you have to give it FIVE STARS! What's up with that? Every kill is shot in slow-mo from fifteen different angles. That is not good direction by any stretch of the imagination for anyone with a shred of critical faculty. Van Damme is like three feet tall, with an accent more syrupy than a chain of waffle houses (to paraphrase Mike Nelson) He does not deserve to be enriched, complimented, or even *tolerated*. Even Hollywood is catching on to this.Admittedly, I'm a horror movie fan, and loathe action movies. But even if I enjoy an occasional crappy horror movie (and that's about 90% of them, if I have to be brutally honest) doesn't mean I give it FIVE STARS! In the future, try not to be so idiotic."
5,DOUBLE TROUBLE,"How close can a set of twins really be? In Grindle's chilling tale, Susannah and Marina deBreems are closer than most. Susannah is coping with the brutal murder of her twin. The police have not been able to find the killer, and ultimately Susannah finds herself a potential victim. She's receiving hang-up phone calls, flowers, someone's vandalized her car, and snuck in and clipped off a piece of her hair. We soon find out that the same things happened to Marina before she was killed.Grindle effectively uses flashbacks to set the stage for the finale. There are some red herrings, and the killer's identity is shocking, since there are at least three or four suspects floating around.The only ""twitch"" I found annoying is that Susannah has become such a reclusive, unyielding soul that she's not totally likeable. I also think more of Mark Cope would have been nice.All in all, though, a very good novel."
3,The Nightspinners,"I chose this book because it was by one of my favorite authors - Lucretia Grindle. It certainly lived up to my speculations, and was a engaging mystery which I couldn't put down. Too bad, I had to buy it as used!"
3,A slow start,"I enjoyed this book once the story took off, I just wish it had piqued my interest earlier. Overall a decent thriller. I felt the title was misleading; don't pick up this book expecting any interesting ""nightspinning,"" as I did, because there is almost none."
1,50 All Time Christmas Favorites,"I was dissappointed that this was not the original ""50 All Time..."". The songs were similar but the music was changed to sound more like today's music and the singing was not very professional. I've had the original for many years and it is pretty well worn out/won't play. Over the years I know music changes, but I thought, with the title being the same as the original that I have, I would be getting the same thing. As I said before I was dissappointed."
4,Does a good job,"I bought this to help keep our laundry room neat. We really like it. the only problem is that our new iron is a llittle tight fitting, but I think that is because the new iron is one that the cord retracts into the base."
5,Over Door - Wall Mount holder,"Perfect and the price was right!Over Door - Wall Mount Iron, Board and Accessory Holder"
4,Organize It All Iron Board Holder,My water spray bottle doesn't fit in the rack - trouble finding a new bottle that will fit into it.
5,Hang your board,"Product is great for handing ironing board. The space for the iron was not large enough for my iron, which is a standard iron. All in all I like it."
3,Laundry Room,This does conserve much space but I have a very old wooden ironing board. My husband had to alter to make it work. I love how it keeps this much needed stuff out of my way.
2,Defects in the wire coating,"The product itself works but mine came with defects. There are several spots where the wire coating, if I should call it this way, was chipped off."
3,"It's not ""Over the door"" as much as it is ""Mounted On the Door""","I gave this product 3 stars simply because it was a little deceptive in it's naming. To me ""Over the Door"" means a product which has hooks that you place on the back of the door and it hangs there via those hooks.This product is not an ""Over the Door"" product, it comes with screws and a mounting plate for you to drill into the back of your door in order to mount it.Other than that the item is as advertised."
3,serves its purpose,works well and holds everything like the photo. i am pleased with the purchase. i would recommend to anyone lacking storage.
3,Not made for heavy duty Boards or Irons!,I loved the concept of this organizer but it came up short for me personally. I will be returning the item for the following reasons.1. Organizer was so low that it didnt even lift the board off the ground.2. Iron purchased from Costco doesn't fit in the holder.I am sure this would be great for someone with a very lightweight board and small in size or else it would be pointless. The iron must also be small width wise.
3,OK,"Its ok for just basic use, but hate that it was to be bolted to the door. If the ironing board is not in place then it bangs around. Its ok for the price."
2,Not strong enough for hanging over the door,I love the idea of keeping the iron and Ironing board along with spray bottles in one place but the hooks for haning this over the door are not strong enough to hold everything. It was up over my door for a couple of weeks before the whole thing came down. I bought this so I do not have to drill any holes into the wall since I rent.
2,Handy but not strong enough,"This is a handy caddy-- one of the few over-the-door holders I could find with room to store the iron and accessories. However, the arms that go over the door are sheet metal, and they're not very strong. The weight of the iron, board, and accessories tend to pull at the arms, unbending them so that the whole thing threatens to crash to the floor. I have to keep rebending the arms. Although I've used the holder now for over two years, I'm looking for one that is more sturdy but still has room for more than just a board and iron."
3,Doesn't hold my ironing board right.,"I think this is a good idea, but if you look at the picture the legs on the ironing board is one straight pole, but my legs are a ""Y"". I had to hang my board from the rack that hold the iron when I iron. I wish it gave you other options since it's obvious no all ironing board legs are the same."
3,Good,"The item itself was sturdy and good, the only downside is, not every iron fits comfortably. Some bottles do not stay put as well."
3,Good one,I have install this product on the wall. It is OK nothing special. It is serve the purpose - hold iron and board.
3,Doesn't work with boards with curved feet,"The quality of this product seems decent enough, and if you have one of the older ironing boards with T-shaped feet, I suspect it would work splendidly. However, I have a newer board with feet that come down parallel to each other and then curve out slightly at the bottom (like most of the boards at the store now do), and it just wouldn't hang on this stand; the two ""hangers"" were spaced too far apart, so the feet just slid right through. I had to return it. One thing I did like about it, though, is that it had hooks to hang it over a door, or screws to mount onto the wall. I liked that option."
3,Iron Board Holder,I bought it for when I move - so therefore I haven't used it yet - but I feel it will be OK!!!!!
5,Stainless buckets,These buckets are just what I needed. Not heavy duty. Butthe gauge is good enough for water buckets that will not rust.I would recommend to anyone.
3,It's just okay,"This product arrived damaged, but Amazon is really good in correcting such mishaps. Receive replacement in no time.Product looks okay, but you can find it cheaper at Home Depot. This product is made out of plastic that can easily brakeor shatter. I can tell because of the way it was shattered when it arrived damaged."
4,"A pleasant, but not inspired, listening experience","This is a review of the audio CD narrated by Alfred Molina.Mr. Molina has a pleasant voice for narration but I had expected more in the way of vocal characterizations from an actor of his stature than I heard in this narration. He did a good job with the pirate voices (and the pirate parrot) but it was not always easy to distinguish among them when several pirates were talking. And because sections of the book are told by different characters, I'd have liked more distinction between the voices of Jim Hawkins, the doctor, the squire and the captain.Although it was not as inspiring a narration as I had hoped it would be, it was an enjoyable listening experience and I didn't regret the time spent on it."
1,removing the price tag marred the dust jacket,"the price tag was stuck on the front cover of the dust jacket. I could not peel it, scrape it or wash it off. I sent an email to mediamoguls as the insert directed:""stupid stupid price labels won't come off I hope you didn't pay a lot for them because they don't come off and ruin the jacket stupid stupid labelsYes I am angryDid I mentionIT'S STUPID TO USE STICKY LABELS THAT RUIN THE JACKET""I received the following reply:""Those were put on by the manufacturer every single book in every single box had that label.. Funny you should mention that it annoys us as well hopefully it will come off without any difficulty I am sorry for the inconvenience happy holidays""Which to me is an offensive reply, no action would be taken and it is my problem, something I did wrong, that made the problem. Not that anyone was going to see how to get the label off, just ""go tell someone who gives a damn"".These guys are terrible"
4,More on Linksys support,"My first sample of this router died (see earlier review), and after some difficulty Linksys replaced it with a new one (retail box). This worked fine for several months, then appeared to die as well. By this time Linksys had replaced their RMA system with one completely online, and adopted a cross-ship policy also, so no more hassles getting an RMA. The replacement was a white-box unit (probably a rebuild), but it turned out that it was the power supply which was defective and not the router, so back the replacement went and now all is well. So I still recommend the unit, and HomePNA too, especially for older homes."
2,Only a prototype,"The idea behind the HPRO200 is a good one. Functionally it is a bridge between ethernet and home phoneline subnetworks combined with a router. The firewall features of the router give good protection against attempts to infect the attached computers with viruses, etc. If you are not already familiar with router and firewall functions, be prepared to spend some time experimenting with the various parameters in the process of learning how to configure the router for your needs.But the HPRO200 with firmware version 1.37.4 is not as reliable as one could and should expect. In my home network, the HPRO200 drops the network connection between the ethernet and the phoneline subnetworks much too often, sometimes after only half a day of operation. Having to reset the unit so often is annoying.My recommendation is to wait with your purchase until a later firmware version that corrects at least this problem is available."
3,"Good, but SLOW","I tried this phoneline network system for the first the time. The good thing is it is easy to use and requires no cables running around thehouse. The bad thing is it is exremely slow. Setup was a breeze but the speed was so slow it went slower than thw actual broadband modem. If you really want easy and speed you should go wireless. 802.11b has become so cheaper the system might be cheaper than the phoneline system. Even better is 802.11g, which is about 54 times faster than this phoneline system. I bought 54g and gave this system to a friend who is trying to network his first computers.The verdict: This system is ok, but if you want a system without wires that is also easy and faster go 802.11b if you have a budget and if you have a little more money get 802.11g(also reffered to as 54G)"
5,Bang for the buck!,"This product offers basic firewall and router functionality for the Homelink Phoneline network in your home. It is the lowest priced product with these features and is easy to configure, reliable, and durable. Whenever price is a concern for your network needs, there is always a Linksys product capable of doing the job every day for years."
5,Get Nicks and Cuts? You won't with this!,"You're reading the words of a guy who always had problems with nicks and cuts, especially under the chin. I have been using this product for over 3-4 years after a dermatologist recommended it. You use a quarter size amount to cover your wet face. Note: this does not make a big lather... just coats the face. The results is the smoothest shave with your face feeling super with all that Aloe! Be sure to use a good razor (2-3 blade type). To finish, use Johnson & Johnson ""Purpose"" Face Cream as an aftershave (with SPF15). It never burns and feels great! Avalon Aloe is so good that when we recently moved and I can't find it locally, I order it now through Amazon.... stock up!"
2,Don't bother!,"I was very disappointed with this CD. The volume of the songs went to extremes up and down, so some you could hardly hear until you turned up the volume and then the next song was blasting loud. Also the way the songs were sung was in such a melancholy tone, it was depressing instead of joyful."
3,"Too detailed, too many pages","It's at once too detailed and not detailed enough. For instance, Palo Alto is spread out on something like 6 pages. It makes it terribly difficult to figure out driving directions anywhere, flipping around all the time. It's extremely detailed, but less useful because of that.If you need to know any particular local area very well, this is your map. If you need to travel around the Bay Area, not so much.It would be very useful if they had intermediary maps... maps that showed overviews of areas as well as street level details."
5,"Please, please, please don't discontinue this brand","I tried this for the first time. I have really pale, neutral skin that does not really register on other brands' spectrums. Alabaster was a perfect match. The concealing kind is perfect for full coverage, which is what I was looking for. As long as you moisturize or prime beforehand, it blends really well. Best part, I didn't even need the pea-size amount that most customers say is all they need. I think the price is great because I would rather pay this much for foundation that matches than buy 6 brands for $5 that don't."
2,Illuminare Extra coverage,A little goes a long way but it is thick and difficult to blend. It dries quickly. Not really worth the money.
3,Unsure,"I've been taking 3 tablets in the a.m and then again 3 tablets in p.m for about 2 weeks and am unsure how I would know whether this is terrific or not so good. I notice one comment about a horrible smell; that I haven't experienced. Since I don't know whether it's a good product or a bad, I've rated it in the middle. Once I find out what I'm looking for I can truly rate it. Any help out there on how I would notice a change?Super Collagen + C Type 1&3 250 Tablets"
2,"The smell & taste will nearly kill you, and","...They don't even work. I found this under a ""hyaluronic acid"" tag, and am contacting Amazon as this has no HA in it at all! Don't waste your time or money on this."
3,good enought,"The reason why I bought this is because this reminds me so much of my teen years. I first read this when I was 13 (my classmate way back in high school loaned it to me) and was enthralled by it. Now, more than 13 years after, I wanted to read it again and remember why I was so fascinated by it. As soon as I got my copy, I realized how different my taste was. The scenes in this book are too dramatic and the characters' reactions were too over the top. Example, instead of describing the character as being impatient, at times, the author would say they character was shouting. Totally inappropriate. The reactions were too severe and extreme.Nevertheless, I still Loved the plot. I have to give it to her, this was her first book (I think?), having published this in the 1970's. I have read her other works and those were definitely a lot better, as far as characters' descriptions are concerned. Still, the PLOT and STORY OF THE CAPTIVE BRIDE IS STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITES."
1,Unoriginal!,"I listened to Captive Bride because I liked the other Johanna Lindsey books I listened to on audio cassettes but I was disappointed in Captive Bride, the story is so unoriginal, the plot has been done so many times before, and the characters in Captive Bride were very unlikeable!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was terrible. I did not enjoy reading it at all. The hero was not at all appealing except maybe in looks and his kidnapping of the heroine was just too much. I don't see how it is possible that lust can turn into love when your feelings are so set against someone you hate. Albeit these two emotions are extremes of each other and some people will likely see the similarity between the symptoms of the two. Usually, JL writes wonderful books, but this one is certainly not her best."
1,TERRIBLE!,This book is TERRIBLE and a big disappointment after reading Ms. Lindsey's terrific Mallory series.I agree with many others who have reviewed Captive Bride that the rapes and spankings really make this a terrible book!
2,"Compared to ""The Sheik""....","This book was one of the first (and last) romance novels I read. It was strongly recommended by a good friend. A few years later I read a ""cliff notes"" type summary of ""The Sheik"" by E.M. Hull. The plot of the Hull novel paralelled the plot of Ms. Lindsey's novel. Cosidering that E.M. Hull's novel was voted the ""Best Novel of 1925"", there is no question of which came first. Save your money and buy a real classic, ""the Sheik"" by E.M. Hull"
2,"Forget the other negative reviews, the real reason this book is bad....","I just finished Captive Bride and felt compelled to write a quick review. I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about when they say there are rapes and beatings. Definite reading comprehension problems. Lindsey makes it CLEAR that the heroine is NOT raped, not even once. This is definitely the ""forced seduction"" category. And, if I recall correctly, the Hero spanks the heroine once (slaps her behind five times). No, the real problem with this book is that it's just not well written. The characters are like paper cut-outs. We're talking very little depth. And when action does occur (which is rare), it is so shallow that it is completely unsatisfying. Also, a great deal of the limited action results from neither of the protagonists being particularly bright. Captive Bride reads more like an outline than a real book. My recommendation is to skip it."
3,One of her earlier works,"This story is, I believe, her first. When compared to some of her later works, it shows. Christina appears often to be spoiled and childish. Philip is demanding and stubborn. Together they make one miscommunication after the other. The story starts out in England, then Egypt where Philip kidnaps Christina, then back to England. The story shows the potential of Johanna Lindsey as a writer. The skill is definitely there, but the magic of the story isn't yet. If you have never read her books, you might better appreciate this story. If you have read Lindsey, then you will definitely see the difference. As a Lindsey fan, it is part of my collection. It is simply not one of my favorites."
3,Not her best....,"Keep in mind, this was JL's FIRST book. She has gotten much better since - but for the decade it was written in, it is pretty good. (Of course, I read my mother's copy when I was 13 - so I thought anything with sex in it that I could get a hold of was bestseller material...) =)"
3,Not bad but not exceptional either.,I did enjoy it but it is most definately to be taken with a grain of salt. Lindsay has written some book that completly outshine this but _A Captive Bride_ is enjoyable.Just don't place modern values on it. You'll go crazy if you do.
1,Lousy!,"Well I wouldn't use it as kindling because I don't believe in burning books but it is a lousy book.FYI: A a woman getting spanked by her man is degrading anywhere!I doubt a middle Eastern woman would shout with joy, yippee my man just spanked me!"
1,You'd be better off reading one of her more recent books,I read this book after reading some of her more recent books. I just about put it down after every chapter. It is obviously her first book because it is written poorly. I finished it only hoping that the writing and storyline would get better and more believable - it didn't. I suggest reading her more recent books where her writing is more mature and the storyline is developed better.
2,A rather disppointing book by Lindsey.,"This is not one of Lindsey's better writings. I was disappointed in it as a whole. The storyline wasn't well worked out. I also felt the characters fall into love was to fast with all the conflicts and culture differences. It wasn't really believable, leaving a person wonder at what they missed(in between the lines). This book is easily left behind after reading."
5,Captive Bride,"Well I have to say I read this book back in 1986, I found it outstanding. I found the book to be so great that I have read it ever year since 1986, maybe sometimes twice a year. The book was well written. I do agree with the fact, I do not like the way Philip makes Christina felt in book. But there chemistry is great. But I can not condemned a well-written book. I also must say her books have even gotten better through the years. I can not make you read everyone of her books, but I can ask you to give it a try. I say If you like romances to aleast give this one a try. Lets say her books differ from all other romance novels. Believe I have had this book so long the cover differs from what they sell now. I have the original dark blue cover with the characters on the front. Again five stars..........Just try it."
1,What was that!!!,That had to be the worst book I have ever read and what's more shocking it's Johanna Lindsey. Thank goodness I borrowed it from my co-worker. I couldn't find anything good about this book but a pretty cover which is why I gave it a one star. I highly do not recommend this book not even from the library.
4,Lindsey starts here!,This book was very good. I enjoyed the different locations and situations the characters were placed in. Well done.
5,Loved this book,"I have read almost all of Johanna Linsdey's books and this one was just as good as all of the rest! I loved this book. I can't believe everyone didn't!! I will admit that the beginning is kind of rushed, but, after the first few chapters, I couldn't put it down. I read it in one evening!! I love Lindsey's work and own almost all of them! This is a keeper and I will more than likely read it again and again!!"
3,Not her best!!!!!,"I am a fan of Lindsey....I will give her that it is her first novel. It is written poorly... It was written in a rushed fashion. But has I have said I have read her other novels and she progressed. the issue of ""Rape"" is a very touchly one however, I have read other novels and the whole ""Capture woman and you are mines things are themes..."" I still love lindsey......."
2,So Absurd it's Hilarious,"I have a few of her first books and after reading through my stock of her newest and in my opinion, her best, I decided to bite the bullet and go for the ones that really didn't catch my interest from looking at their summaries.It is clear that this book was written a long, long time ago. The paragraphs are really choppy; in one paragraph you'll be here and in the next a lot of time has passed and you'll be somewhere else. The love-making is quite...almost juvenile I'd say. ""He mounted her."" I had to keep reminding myself that this book was thirty years old too. But I didn't even get half-way and had to skip to the end just because I couldn't take it lmao.Though what is most intriguing is the writing style reminded me of her last book that wasn't so good either. Is JL losing her touch?So in short...don't read this book unless you have absolutely nothing better to do and want to be amused. Go more recent!"
3,not too bad,"This was one of the first romance novels that i read and so i got quite hooked up. I muz say that it has certain entertaining elements like the adventure, the setting, etc. But now, after reading many other books, i find that this one is juz a typical romance like others: gorgeous hero&heroine;, an unoriginal plot (Lindsey let her heroines be abducted and raped in many of her works!!), a big misunderstanding , the main reason of which is that those people juz can't open their mouth to admit their love. The characters are not so believable, Christina can easily fall for Phillip despite his brutish behaviour and foul temper. I cant help but feel that she falls bcoz of his good look and great sex, perhaps a teenage girl with crazy romantic notions may be a more suitable heroine.On the whole this book is not so bad. juz keep in mind that u r reading a typical romance book, not an outstanding one."
1,Captive Bride,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. There wasn't one redeeming quality about Philip! What a creep! As if any woman would want to be with him! He treated Christina abominably and she loves him! He spanks her and constantly threatens to beat her! And then when she does get away from him, he threatens to take her child? Please!!! I couldn't wait till the book was over. Johanna has improved sooooo much since this book! Please don't waste your time, and if you do, don't judge her work by this terrible book!"
1,Awful!,"Being a fan of Johanna Lindsey's Malory series I bought Captive Bride and instead of enjoying this book like the Malory books I was very disappointed and I have to agree with Gina and other reviewers with why they don't like this book, I don't like it for the very same reasons and think the book is just awful!Sorry but abusive men just don't do it for me!"
1,The worst book i have ever read,"After reading some of your reviews, I wish I would never have even picked this one up! To actually think this book is romantic is unbelievable! Some better adjectives to describe it? Asinine, farfetched, tortured, and just plain terrible! The characters are ludicrous and difficult to relate with. The hero of the book is a rapist who continually rapes and beats this poor woman, who actually considers herself lucky! Feels more like a Jerry Springer episode than a romance novel.I have read some of her other books and cannot believe this one actually got published.Where are the women's rights groups? Shame on anyone who might think this twisted relationship is romantic on any level!"
2,Not one of my favs,"The plot was pretty good, however I thought she could have done a lot better by lengthing the romance between the two characters. It seemed to me the characters went to fast. One minute Christina hates Philip, then the next she can't live without him. I thought she could have developed these characters a little more and given some depth to their romance. This was one of the shortest novels of Ms. Lindsey's that I have read and I must say she rushed through the story and it was very obvious."
3,I think this book was great!,"Ok, I'll admit its not my favorite Johanna Lindsey book. It was still a worthwhile read. If the spankings and rape annoys so many people, they can skip those parts like I do. It was written over thirty years ago, so people need to realize that things were a little different back then. For a first book, I give it two thumbs up and I suggest people stop whining about how degrading it is and look at the big picture instead of the miniscule details. The rape and the spanking are not the greatest parts of the story, but they help us realize what kind of person Phillip was and how he changed throughout the book. Lindsey has better stories, but this one is no where near the horrible book some people proclaim it to be. Choose for yourself, but realize that a book is more than it's details. It is a story that is built upon those details to create a final product that leaves a sense of satisfaction in the reader and should be a fond memory."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I refused to finish this mess. A young women is taken hostage and raped. Gee, that's not what I find romantic. I really enjoyed most of Ms. Lindsey's books that I read. I stopped reading her altogether after I started this one."
3,Captive Dud,"Captive Bride is an okay novel. It was suspenseful and exciting, which I did enjoy, but, it was seriously lacking in the romance department. The two main characters did have quite a few sexual encounters but they ended quickly without any detail. The main characters weren't really to my liking, she seemed kind of pathetic and he was a no class jerk. I was actually kind of surprised because I usually love all of Johanna Lindsey's novels, but this one just wasn't as much to my liking.^^I wrote this right after I read the novel, but I just found out the other day that Captive Bride was Lindsey's first novel, and I believe that I was a little bit too critical of it. It was excellent for a first novel by someone."
3,Not What I Had Hoped,"This could have been a steamy sexy book. But Lindsey opted to write a more Correct verison. I doubt that most female slaves in the Arabian empire were treated quite so well. Philip is the typical Arabian raised male, arrogrant, overbearing, and by our standards rude. He thinks all women such be kept in bed. Christina is a spoiled rich girl that has never had anyone tell her know. The clash of these to could have been powerful and erotic. It ends up being the same old story."
1,Hated it!,"Wow this book was absolutely horrible. I noticed that in a lot of Johanna Lindsey's earlier books the narration is flat, the characters two-dimensional, the men are barbarians, and the women insipid, and completely moronic for all of their amazing beauty (and they are all incredibly beautiful *rolling eyes*). Her first book is no exception. This book was horrible. Phillip only made me hate him more as the book progressed, I never liked Christina but became so annoyed with her by the end that I couldn't take it. Half way through the story I got online to see what the reviews of the book were, and most were horrible. At more then one point in the story I actually threw the book I was so irritated. This is story telling at its worst!"
1,Garbage Costume,"I bought this costume for my daughter for Halloween. It looks absolutely horrible. It is advertised as being purple. It is teal blue. The fabric is advertised as shiny purple, it looks nothing like the picture. It looks dull and cheap. It looks like my daughter is wearing a ugly nightgown. She crys when she puts it on and now we are throwing it away. A waste of $40.00"
1,Incompatible with mini keyboards,None of my rack mount keyboards are compatible with this product. You are forced to use a standard keyboard. Why? Who knows? Steer clear!
5,children's Bible story book,I'm reading this book to my granddaughter. Having questions at the end of the short stories makes it fun for her. It's a keeper for a four or five-year old.
4,Great Book for Children,"It's a thrill for parents to buy their children their first Bible. How do you choose? The Bible in Pictures for Little Eyes has been a favorite for over four decades, with short illustrated Bible stories written in simple language. Now, The New Bible in Pictures for Little Eyes features entirely updated artwork. This easily portable edition is the perfect interactive way to share the truths of the Bible with the youngest ones in you life. I highly recommend this book for Parents to give to their children!"
3,"Full of detail, but toes the Party line","I agree; this book is full of detail about the life and career of this military and political genius. However, the language is a bit dated. It is written in a laborious, scholarly, Victorian style with lots of dependent clauses rather than a fluid, easy-to-read, modern journalistic style. I should also mention that the author takes the official Party line on controversial issues such as the burning of Smyrna and the Armenian holocaust. Having said this, I would still recommend it. It was the first biography of Atatürk in English, written by a man who was his contemporary and, as such, it is an important historical document."
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered two of the Versace Blue Jeans bottles for Christmas gifts for my nephew's. Please don't let the picture fool you. The cannister and the bottle both come bearing the name ""Versus"" instead of the Versace logo. Neither the cannister nor the bottle look anything like the picture. Naturally, I assumed I would be receiving exactly what I was being shown, not in this case. Buyer Beware."
5,Excellence,"I ordered this item for my boyfriend for Christmas, i received the item in a timely matter and it smells really great. Didnt have any problems with the order and i would definately order from this company again."
1,this is fake knock off false advertising its versus not versace its fake,This is a photo of versace but what you get is versus which is a take knock off false advertising 100% scam here this crap is $2.00 cologne not real versace at all or by far you guys are gonna get sued for selling fake crap!!!
1,Switched brands,I read some of the other reviews that said to beware that an imitation may be sent rather than what is ordered. Very disappointed that Amazon did this to me too. I paid special attention to what I ordered to be sure I wasn't getting a knock-off and I still received an imitation rather than the real thing.....of course the price remained the same as my original order. From now on I will be sure to listen to all of the reviews.
3,A Good Product,"I have purchased a couple of these for myself as well as 1 for a gift and plan on additional purchases as gifts going into the holidays. Suggest purchasing the ""testers"" for personal use to save a little money if you don't care about the top (or save the top from one of your bottles to reuse) or gift canister. Not the best as far as ""longevity"" with regard to the sent lasting but for the cost a good product."
2,Not how I remembered it,"I smelled this cologne on someone once and I loved it so I bought it for my husband. When we received it my husband put it on and we decided immediately that it was not for him. I suppose that fragrances smell different on different people, but it was not something that I cared for! This is only an opinion. I am not saying that there is anything wrong with this cologne. You would have to smell it for yourself to decide if it is right for you!"
3,so-so,"It is okay, but doesn't live-up to the hype. Smells too sweet, reminds me of Stetson or something. I know a cologne is a winner when I get multiple compliments regarding it. This has gotten none so far, which is unusual."
1,Dooped,"If I would have received the right cologne, maybe it might have ranked high. But since Amazon sent me ""Versus,"" well I guess I'm not so pleased AT ALL! It's funny, Versace make two cologne's (yea and many more), but one is ""Versus"" another is ""Blue Jeans."" Looks like Amazon got dooped into buying a KNOCK-OFF of both and they're passing them onto unsuspecting consumers. Look at the metal container and bottle. If it says versus anywhere, you've been mis-sent the same knock-off as I. I called and complained to Amazon and hopefully will receive the real thing in a couple days. Some one in procurement at Amazon needs to pay more attention to what they buy."
2,Baby smell,"It smells like a perfume for a new born. The black version smells great, but wouldn't last. This one isn't the perfume for a man."
3,"Marshall's, TJ Max, or Ross","If you want to find the fragrance some place local try the stores I have listed above. I've never seen it in any retail store for more then $20, I've even seen it as low as $10 so shop around. Great fragrance just does'nt last long."
1,Deceiving Consumers,"When you order this item, you will not receive the product listed.Instead, you will receive a knock-off called ""Versus Blue Jeans Man"" which can be purchased from many fragrance discounters for less."
1,Poor Imitation,Thought I was ordering the real Blue Jeans fragrance. This has way too much alcohol in it. Don't waste your time.
2,Fake?,"I also have a bottle of this cologne that says by ""Verses"" , not Versace.I feel taken for the 1st time on Amazon!!"
3,"Grim, grim, grim","I've read this book twice now. My impression after the first time was what an awful, dark book it was. I thought perhaps outside things had influenced my reading, so I read it again 7 years later. Nope. Same thing.One grim event after another, and not a single likable character in the book. This would be forgivable if there was an eleventh-hour redemption, but there's nothing. As another reviewer has said, it's kind of like a horrible car accident that you can't tear your eyes away from.That said, the writing was compelling. Both times I read the book, I could hardly put it down -- and the first time I read it, I was in Bali! A good lesson for aspiring fiction writers: how can a book like this work? I'm still scratching my head over that one. But in the sense of keeping people reading, it's a huge success. In the sense of liking it after you've finished? No way."
2,Men are evil....yet again...,"How many books do I have to read where men are evil and women are struggling and the only ""perfect"" love in the book is interracial lesbianism in the early 1900's? And the spunky character is totally unsympathetic and manipulates the only decent man, a black man, into siring her only offspring.It started out so promising and interesting and then the last half was the pits. I was hoping it would redeem itself at the end but was sorely disappointed. Beyond the realm of believable or engendering any empathy to the characters. The only sympathetic character I liked was Materia's dad who had the sense to kick that nut out of his house at the beginning of the book!!"
3,"Darkly humorous, but not for everyone","Ms. MacDonald obviously has a talent for writing, particularly the use of dark humor. Even so, not everyone will enjoy this book. BE AWARE there are elements of physical and mental abuse along with incestuous lust (and that's just in the first third of the book). I'm not sure what to call the Caesarean performed using scissors and what follows in the creek and vegetable garden, but after that, I decided there were other books I'd rather read.If you like quirky stories with an odd twist of humor, you will enjoy this book. If not, wait for the next one by Ms MacDonald. I'm sure we will be hearing more from this talented, new writer."
4,A Tragic Story of a Family,"Fall on Your Knees chronicles the tragic Piper family. MacDonald uses her playwright background to bring the characters to life before your eyes and draw you in to the story. The book depicts James and his naive bride, Materia as they marry against her family's wishes and struggle throughout the remainder of the remainder of their lives. Materia cannot be the woman that James wants her to be, hence their family is doomed from the start. His actions have a longterm tragic effect on their children. Beware that although the book is very well written, it is quite depressing and paints out horrifying scenes of torment and secrets that destroy a family."
5,Loved it,"This was a pretty depressing novel, however I found it very interesting, overall I would have liked to see more from the mother and a little less dysfunction so that you can delve further into the characters. Thats just my preference. I would recommend this book and be inerested in more from her."
4,"Years later, this book is still fresh in my mind!","Like Animal Farm, The Jungle and a handful of select others, this book is one that has managed to stay on my mind over the years since I first read it. Another reviewer compared it to a car accident that you just can't look away from, and I agree. Some of the more disturning (memorable) parts, I didn't see coming and that tells me that the author wove in tiny details with just enough subtlty and tact that the story as a whole read seamlessly. Yes, it is a tragic story, and I felt a deep sadness at it's conclusion for the events and circumstances. But more importantly, I felt as if I personally knew the characters, which made the high emotions all the more likely to stay with me, even years later."
1,"Ugh, I'm at page 350 but I started this over 9 months ago!",The only reason I'm finishing this bore of a book is that I always finish what I start and there's always some hope that it will get better. Can't wait to be done with it and move on to something better.
1,"Depraved, Deprived, and Depressing","Fall On Your Knees was one of the most beautifully written, depressingly awful books I have ever read. The prose was lyric, but confusing in places. The characters were hopeless and the story line was worse. I made myself complete this book, but will not bother to read one of Oprah's Book Club choices again, as depravity, deprivation, and darkness seem to be requirements for inclusion into her reading choices. Life is too short for me to waste my time on reading anything resembling Fall On Your Knees."
1,What a Stinker!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are completely unlikable if not despicable. The storyline is very dark and obsessed with incestuous relationships. There was one scene that was so graphic, it gave me a stomach ache. I felt like I was living through a nightmare.The weirdest thing is that my grandmother sent me this book. The entire time I was reading this, I just kept thinking to myself, ""Why would she send this to me? Why did she read this?"" About a week after finishing the book, I learned it was an ""Oprah"" book and I realized what a blessing it is that Ms. Winfrey has discontinued her club. If this is the kind of book she's reccomending to the masses, I want no part of it."
2,Mediocore,"This was my first Oprah book. It was a huge disappointment.I figured out all of the ""secrets"" in the book early on. The story was told in a slow, predictable manner.The most interesting part were the sections from Kathleen's diary.I would not recommend this book - there are so many other great fiction novels out there."
2,Read the online excerpt and stop.,"Fall on Your Knees gets two stars instead of one because the author's writing is very good. Read the online excerpt, appreciate her craftsmanship and stop. The plot, about a diseased family and their journey to ruin is heart sickening. The main character James, inspires hatred by the third chapter. Upon finishing each chapter, I asked myself, ""Do I throw the book in the trash now or continue to see if the family ever gets out of the mire he created?"" No matter how well the words were written, finishing the book and finding out what happened to the family did not bring satisfaction."
3,Difficult to keep the story straight!,"I struggled through about 3/4ths of this book before deciding that it just wasn't worth finishing. I liked the story, but it was a difficult read."
5,My new favorite book!,"This was released in Canada, and I read it right awayafter attending a reading of it by the author. Some of themost beautiful prose and imagery I've ever read, with acreative and enchanting/original epic plot. At 500 pages,I was surprised that I couldnt put it down and read itin less than 3 days!I highly recommend it to anyone. A must read!!"
2,Disappointing and terribly boring,"I read half of this book and quit, something I rarely do. The story was pretty good at first but then it began to go on and on and on about the sisters giving so much detail that I finally lost interest. I got to the point where I no longer cared what happened to any of them and went on to read something else. I was terribly disappointed in this book and don't think I would care to read another one by this author in the future."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. The author writes well, but the themes were just too dark for me and parts of it were bizarre and didn't make sense. The only reason that I finished reading it was because I was hoping for something redeeming. It didn't happen."
5,Beyond Expectations,"I bought this book simply to have something to read, figuring that Oprah's books are generally entertaining, if not substantial. (Granted, there are a few exceptions.) I can honestly say that I was completely floored. This book is chilling and hilarious at the same time and absolutely one of my top ten favorite books of all time. I am also convinced that it is one of the best novels written in the past decase. Dark and terribly sad, but very powerful. From the first couple of pages (in the graveyard) I was hooked.When I finished the book, I was literally quite surprised by how good it was. I love to read and have favorites in different genres, but ""Fall On Your Knees"" is as close to a parallel of Faulkner's ""The Sound and The Fury"" as I have ever seen. I was surprised that I have not heard more about Ann-Marie MacDonald, but hope to see much more of her work in the future."
2,Is it over yet?,"Maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't understand all the rave reviews this book is getting. As a fellow Canadian writer, I really wanted to like this book. I do think Ms. MacDonald is an excellent writer but she could do so much better than this poorly told tale. I wasn't offended by the subject matter but the same story could have been told more effectively with fewer, better chosen words. I'm not fond of the ""flashback"" style, either. I finished the book because I've never read one of Oprah's choices in the slotted time but I had to force myself to pick it up each time. Also, I never think it's fair to review a book without finishing it. I really kept hoping, with every page, that the book would improve. Quite frankly, I was happy and exhausted when I reached the final page."
3,my advice beofre you read this!,"out of all the current reviews, i think mine is a mix of all of them.. im not going to go into a long detailed description or anything but this is definitely a crazy-weird bookif u have the time (its really long!!) Read it BUT im warning you though..its hard to put down! the characters are quite messed up and theres a lot of things that are really depressing and scary.. i think she's a good writer, its a good book, though not amazing, and theres so many characters and time switches that it confuses you at first.. and i really hated the way it ended it didn't leave me with a sense of satisfaction or happiness but then, its not supposed to be one of those feel-good books! im just rambling here but basically, read it if u have the patience, but be prepared for strange *horrible* things [that really make you hate some characters!!!] to happen ..."
2,Great Title-Downhill from There.,"I had great expectatons for this book as it was recommended to me by a good friend. However, it was a testament to the strength of our friendship that I actually forced myself to finish it.Nice characters are never fully develpoed, and I never felt any connection to them-at least not enough to care what happened. (Which in the end wasn't very much anyway)"
2,This is why I hesitate to read an Oprah book,"I've learned a long time ago not to grab every book that Oprah recommends. I took a chance with ""A Fine Balance"" and loved it, loved, loved it, so, I said, ""Self, why not try ""Fall on your Knees""? Why not indeed? This isn't the worst book I've read but when you expect something decent and don't get it, it's worse than a poorly written book that you had no expectations for. I didn't like the writing style, I couldn't believe what the father did (not because I didn't think him capable, but because there was no effective characterisation to support it; neither was there effective characterisation to support the oldest daughter and what she does/is), the author's revelations were primarily based on huge omissions and I didn't care about any of the characters. This book just didn't do it for me. Read ""A Fine Balance"" instead and get your money's worth."
1,A bit of muddied gold,"At times, the prose shines, but I think the author falls in love with her words and neglects her characters, which devolve into literary cliches - as other reviewers have noted, the theme of this story is that men are bad/weak/lustful, while only lesbian love (preferably, in lit fic, interracial lesbian love) is the only true love -- and only there to be ruined by that bad old man again. The characters act out of character when it's convenient for the author for them to do so. Babies are born just so they can die and cause more guilt on these already directionless people. Sheesh, even the cat, the best character in the book and the only one with a brain in its head, dies. Too over-the-top."
1,think about it,"This book, despite its creative prose and complex plot inserts much sexual acts that to be blunt..is not worth reading. I did not even attempt to read on after I stumbled upon such scene. There was too much revolving around the relationships of the sisters, that should have been censored. If this were a movie it is like protecting oneself from those simply impure images. Sure it may be great, but the purity of your soul is worth more than the 556 pages (regardless of its content, plot, theme or reputation)."
4,A creeper,"This book crept up on me, insinuating itself into my mind so that at the end, I turned back to page one to begin again. Others have commented that they could not identify with the characters; but their ""difficulty"" was what I loved about them and the book. The characters were each horrible and flawed, but with redemption. And not ever were they reduced to being charicatures of evil or simply ""bad."" They were real and textured, even James who is the worst of them. I highly recommend this book."
2,"Disturbing, yet compelling.",This was a book I couldn't put down...yet I wish I had never picked it up.
3,A jigsaw puzzle,"Reading this book was like putting together a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, only to be disappointed to see the final picture in the end. This was not an easy book to read, many passages were cryptic and inferred. The sisters were spooky and a bit neurotic. The father James was an incestuous man who instead of keeping his family together, literally tore them apart. The family was one big mess. How anyone could find happiness in such a household, is beyond me. This is not another ""Little Women""."
4,Fall On Your Knees and give thanks for a great author!,"Talk about dysfunctional families! This crew takes the all-time prize. Filled with family secrets, passion, secrets, and shame, Ms. McDonald's novel tells the rich saga of five generations of a coal-mining community family in Nova Scotia. It truly is an epic, lasting about 700 pages, but every page is a gem."
3,Great Writing but the Story Is Without Much Redemption,"Unlike most reviewers, I did not love or hate this book. I feel more ambiguous about it. The terrible things that happen to the Piper family are at times truly disturbing and haunting even to the point of making my stomache ache as I read about them. I could get past these events, if the ending had offered more closure but unfortunately, for me there was only a limited sense of redemption. The writing itself, however is lovely as are the characterizations and the authors ability to connect readers to characters with very little to like about them."
5,Gripping. A very good read.,"I picked this book up, for no apparent reason at a book store. It didn't sound like anything that I would ever read. But, I was drawn too it. It must be fate, because I started it. And that first sentence caught me, ""They're all dead now."" and then to the last page I was hooked.It was sad, and darkly comic. With many unforgettable characters, who live through things far weirder then anything that I have ever known to happen to someone.I will say that this is by far one of the best books I have ever had the chance to read. I have suggested to everyone I know, many have read and enjoyed it. Others are still waiting for the chance to read it."
5,I fall on my knees to praise this novel.,"Fall on Your Knees gained slow but steady momentum in Canada. This is the equivalent of Oprah's magic wand sprinkling book fairy dust on it. The praise was building: words like astonishing, unique, unforgettable, best book of the year, masterpiece were tumbling out at small and large bookstores alike. I succumbed to the juicy gossip and subsequently fell into a four day black hole of maratime Cape Breton. Rarely does a novel live up to extraordinary hype but this one does. In fact, it goes far beyond. If praise alone keeps you from purchasing this book, let me give you a brief idea of what it encompasses: a multi-racial marriage in the early 1900's and the brood of best fictional children I have ever encountered, Catholicism and it's many tenticles, old fashioned gossip in a small town, and silenced abuse that changes everyone's life. Absolutely amazing is all that's left to say."
1,Fall on your Knees,"I am usually a big fan of Oprah's books but this was awful!! I couldn't even finish it. Midway through, 2 main characters die, there is child molestation, infantacide and the maiming of another infant!! It was just too much. LGM"
1,Only a depraved mind could enjoy this book,"The synopses of this book do not come close to indicating the depravity of mind it must have taken to write the subject matter. The author attempts to make child sexual abuse and incestual rape seem a normal part of family life among 4 sisters and does a pretty good job of making the reader feel sorry for the perpetrator. The resulting ""sins"" (as the description on the back cover refers to them) will make you nauseated! As far as the ""redemption"" the back covers refers to - I found none. As the author alludes to child sexual abuse in vague language in early chapters, the reader isn't quite sure that is what is taking place. But, it gets much worse. Death, lies, homosexuality all lead up to incestual rape which leads to more death and child prostitution. I should have followed my instinct about half way through the book -- and burned it!"
1,"Depressing, sad, pitiful","How much more can happen to these poor people? Every cliched tragedy is here: incest, rape, death, murder, war, violence, greed--you name it, they suffer it--way too much."
2,Somehow I kept reading,"I took this book on a beach vacation to relax- big mistake! Ms. MacDonald is a skilled writer I will say that, but I am sorry I found this book terribly sad, depressing, and emotionally manipulative. I found that the stereotypical characters neither learned from, survived or thrived after such extreme familial dysfunction. There is not a single decent moral male character in the entire novel. VERY unfair!! The so called redemption was terribly dissatisfying and left me cold. Also the religious cliches were abused endlessly-a book trying real hard to be P.C."
2,The Sins of the Parents,I found the story to be very confusing at times. I had to keep going back in the story and clarify families and family members.There were many interesting sub stories that were both warm hearted and comforting. I came way from this feeling somewhat inadequate as I still had questions at the end of the story.
3,too long and too weird,"First, let me state that I was reading this book as part of a book club that I am a member of. I say this because if it weren't for the fact that I HAD to finish this book, it never would have happened!Fall on Your Knees starts very slowly. So slowly that it is hard to care about any of the characters. (None of them are really sympathetic creatures anyways).The middle of the book actually does get things rolling and it becomes quite a page turner. I read the middle portion quickly in one sitting.However, by the end, what was interesting has ended, and you are no longer interested in any member of this pathetic family.There are some plot twists within this book; however, any trained reader can spot them from a mile away.If at all possible, unless you are a glutton for punishment, avoid the chore of reading this book."
3,Not worth your time reading,"The story is mostly about the Piper's family and their internal struggle to love, protect, and take care of one another.This book is a bit long, and I found it to be quite disturbing. I would tell the story to my friends as I read and it strikes them all as disturbing because of the incest theme which is the highlight of this novel. Most of the characters portrayed are interesting, yet I did not fully get to know them because many of their problems are not resolved. It's not a 'happily ever after' story for many of the characters and the resolution is a bit abrupt.The story is not too bad, but I would've rather spent my time reading something else, such as ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" or ""Fallen Angels""."
5,Our first book club selection,"We just read Fall on your Knees for our book club here in Ottawa, Canada. I would highly recommend this novel. It can be challenging but it is also very rewarding. The characters lives are shaped with struggle, violence, deception, and yet they survive. An excellent novel"
4,600 pages flew by!,"This beautiful and expansive novel contains moments of pure poetry! I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because at times I felt the author was trying to cover too many topics. Instead of covering incest, interracial relationships, and sexual orientation together, the author could have focused on a single issue and developed it more. Yet the novel works because the characters struggling with these issues are very human and spirited. They captivated me as much as the author's writing style, and I read 600 pages in a few hours. Highly recommended."
2,Too long and dissappointing...,"This book holds a lot of promise with its intrigue and plot twists. But it fails to deliver a big impact consistently. Even though it is exceptionally written, it wanders too much, particularly in the middle. James is too much of a one-sided character. He is a sick, unlikable man and it is hard to read and accept the tragedies he brings to his daughters. I found it disturbing but just for the sake of it. It deals with the horrors of incest in a cliche way-- makes you feel very impatient and disgusted without any hope for redemption. The outlook of the book was not fresh nor unique. It just blends with mediocre literature."
3,Good read.,"I enjoyed reading this book because it was told wonderfully and the writing was fresh and different. Some of the characters, such as Frances and Lily, are wonderfully developed. But at the same time, Kathleen and her father, James Piper, are not. By the end of the book, the reader cannot justify either character, nor have a clear understanding as to why they were the way they were. If you enjoy books where family secrets are revealed piece by piece, this is a good book for you. It certainly kept me guessing and made the ending worth the read. She is a good storyteller, but sometimes her characters are hard to believe."
4,A great read,"The book kept me interested even when I put it down. I absolutely loved how the author could take you from the past to the present and sometimes the future of the story without a hitch. It was an excellent read...keeping me one step behind at all times, but never leaving me in the dark. You think you know where it will lead you next...not a chance! Try this book, it's worth reading."
5,Fall on Your Knees,"This book grabs you from the very first line and keeps you entirely riveted until the last page. The characters are real and completely amazing. I read about 50 books a year, and I have never read a book so fast. Hard to explain what it is about, but it blows all Oprah books out of the water."
5,riveting reading,"I have enjoyed most all of the Oprah books that I have read. This by far is one of the best. I couldn't put it down once I started. I became so absorbed in the story.It is disturbing yet I could feel for each of the characters. You get to know them. James, his wife and three daughters and how their lifes are shaped by a couple of incidents and secrets that shatter everybody's life to some degree.It is interesting to see what develops. I continued to think about this book once I finished it. I felt I knew this family.I highly recommend this book. It can be sad and disturbing to read but stay with it, it is worth it."
3,Unsettling and dark,"This is one of the books I have to read in broad daylight - somehow it's unsettling and spooky, especially Frances disturbed me. It wasn't a very gripping read to me, but interesting enough to keep on reading, although I feel the middle part could have been shortened a bit. I got a bit tiresome of the dark Frances and the angelic Lily and the Martha-like Mercedes - stereotypes. In the end it got better: Kathleen's diary is terrific and the style is much more appealing and clear. On the whole, the book reads like watching a film."
2,"I finished it, but would not recommend it as a favourite","I felt the narrative was difficult to follow at times. I was interested enough in the Piper family to make it through the book, but was disappointed in the ending as it didn't really wrap things up as clean as I hoped. A lot of time invested for what I got out of it...can't understand all of the other high ratings this one received."
3,overrated,"I admire the author for writing a 500+ page book. That's admirable. But I thought this book did not live up to its hype. A story about a family in Cape Breton could be fascinating, but this story was just depressing and not that interesting. It didn't keep my attention. I didn't feel for the characters. I thought the story was overdone and overwraught, and I couldn't wait to get it over with. Not a good sign."
2,gratuitous baby deaths ruin the novel for me,"Call me a softie, but I hate to read about the death of a baby or child. I can handle it if it enhances a story in some way, but the baby deaths in this novel seem entirely pointless. In fact, most of what happens in this novel seemed pointless and depressing to me. Don't assume I'm some Christian housewife with 4 kids either. I'm not. I'm educated and I enjoy a good dark novel from time to time, but in my opinion this one is not a good dark novel. It's a mediocre novel that tries to be interesting by creating strange characters and events. It fails because the characters are not believable and they don't invite much empathy. The shape of the plot is interesting, and the style is a little compelling, but all in all I was disappointed."
2,So what?,"While I do not deny this is a good read I truly don't understand all the accolades for this book.It is basically about the miserable lives of the women in this perverted, incestuous family. Where are the redeeming values? Why should I care? Why was the creepy father forgiven?After 400 and some odd pages I felt more like a voyeur than anything else and I wondered, so what?"
2,What a crazy book,"Whew....that was a long story. Entertaining yes, but of little literary value, I'd say. Overall, I think the best part of it was the character Frances, she was the most developed and least cliched of all the sisters (and I would like to add that Lily is not exactly one of the ""sisters""). Very soap-opera, but an easy read, and entertaining."
4,Great story,"This was a thoroughly engrossing story, with fascinasting character studies. Nearing the end, it became a real page turner.This is storytelling at its best."
2,Say What?,No family could have that much nutiness. Preposterous. How did Francis' son find her? No one else had read her diary.
1,dreadful,"This is one of those books which came recommended. As I was reading, I kept thinking 'when it is going to be good?'. What I got instead was a too long story with no insight, no psychological or spiritual progression. There were no likeable (or believable) characters - the only one who might have generated sympathy was killed off fairly early in the book. The rest are just revolting people going after short-term gratification while involved in various bizarre circumstances. It's as if the author's only skill was to shock the reader while throwing in a few tidbits of social tolerance.IMHO, one distasteful scene after another isn't sufficient to make a good novel."
1,Awful!,"STOP! Don't even think of reading this book unless you like to be tortured by dysfunctional characters and sickening events! This book is interesting at the beginning but progresses in a downward spiral. I forced myself to finish this book, hoping that the end would be better. NO! I felt as if the author had thrown in every horrid thing that she could in order to shock her readers and hope to get their sympathy. Walking on hot coals would be less painful than reading this book!"
1,"Grim, Grimmer, Grimmest!","Ugh! What a mess this book is! How can anyone write hundreds of pages of unrelenting misery, suffered by unbearable, unrealistic characters? I was most interested in Materia and in Kathleen --until the author killed them and ran off into a miasma of sick, dark, implausible ""plot twists."" Yeah, twisted is right! Child prostitution, incest, domestic violence, insanity, transgenderism--for pity sake.... That final 100 pages or so was nothing but an insult to the readers(like me) who've slogged through, hoping against hope for *some* redemption..."
2,Why?,"Why read a book like this that leaves you somewhat depressed and has done nothing to enlighten or inform or even entertain? The author writes very well and I read and read, then I put the book down for a few days. I then wondered why would I want to finish reading this sad and perverted story."
3,Strange but good!,"I read the book sometime ago. I recently spoke with a friend who brought it back to mind again. Out of curosity and being the info-junky that I am I decided to research Ann-Marie McDonald's writing history. I started at Amazon, of course. I read the reviews of ""Fall on you Knees"", just because, and decided to add my two cents worth. I enjoyed the book, lots of twists and turns, hard to follow at times, but enjoyable non the less. Would I read it again? No. Not because it was bad, don't take me wrong, I guess there is so much more out there to read that I just can not see myself rereading this particular book. I do have favorites that I will reread again and again. This just is not among them.Ms. McDonald is a wonderful writer. I will continue to look for more of her books and might even consider reading another if it peaks my interest."
2,Too depressing for me,"I don't mind reading an occasional tragedy but this book went overkill on tragedy. I am a big fan of Oprah Winfrey, but I've yet to enjoy any of the books from her book club. They are all so depressing and full of disfunctional characters. I usually read before going to bed and every night that I read this book I would have horrible dreams/nightmares. The night after I finished this book I slept very soundly :)"
1,YET ANOTHER DISTURBING BOOK,"Some readers have praised the writing as lyrical and wonderful. I find that this kind of choppy writing which goes back and forth between time periods, sometimes talking about characters that have yet to be introduced...is an annoyance and a gimmick that has been overused in the past 25 years. Quit switching back and forth and just write a good story! More importantly, I was so disturbed by the content that I really felt I needed to take a shower in some parts. The childbirth scene and ritualistic baptisms were really nauseating. I was also turned off by the depiction of the Catholic religion. Catholicism is portrayed (yet again) as a sick, guilt-inducing, superstitious religion that makes people act very strange. I am a Catholic and I am sick of reading these stereotypes!!!!!This book was chosen for my neighborhood book club and I am very interested to hear what the others think. ..."
2,"depressing, even boring","I'm so sorry I wasted my time with this book. The story has not one character you can really like, it is totally humourless and dark family-saga. Incest, foreign cultures, mysterious sexual forces, it's all there, but why? What a pity she can write!"
1,The worst book I have ever read,"This book was an emotional roller coaster. Don't even waste your time and money unless you LIKE reading about incest, pedophilia, tragic deaths, the drowning of a baby, and characters so disturbed you can't even begin to like them or wish them well. I can't even give this book away."
1,promising...and then plain boring,"on advice of a good friend i picked up this book, it was a promising start and then the book lost it's pace..this turned out to be a waste of money and before it became a waste of my time i throwed it out....."
2,Not very good!!!,"I did not enjoy reading ""Fall on Your Knees"". It was a bit confusing, one of those books that you have to read between the lines so much just to understand what is happening. If not, you can get totally lost. To me reading is supposed to be fun, and not work just to understand it. I think authors should just flat out tell you what is going on, and this book didn't do that. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially if you want a leisurely read, don't choose this."
1,Not a fun read,"This book is dreadfully depressing. The only reason I tolerated the subject matter as long as I did---I didn't finish---was because it was our book-club selection. Part of the fun of reading anything is the imagery you create in your mind, so reading about incest is not the way I want to spend my free time."
1,Total Garbage,"I have never watched daytime television, including soap operas, but I am convinced that this book is a faithful homage thereto. I have to disagree strongly with the reviewers who low rate this manure pile on the ground that it's depressing. You have to take it seriously to find it depressing and this is certainly not even near worth taking seriously. I'll do you a favor by revealing the central plot element so you don't have to read it. Little Lily is the product of the incestual rape of Kathleen by her father, James, when he catches Kathleen in flagrante with her ""black"" lesbian lover, Rose, who is herself the product of her white prostitute mother and probably one of her black clients. It's easier to watch this sort of crap on TV. I'm forced to rate this as one star out of five; actually it's minus a hundred stars."
2,Was I missing something,I searched quite a while to obtain this book and when I finally bought it I dove right into and 100 pages later was still waiting for something to happen. Now it is on Oprah's list so it is must be good after all. For anyone who can finish this book I admire your sticktoitinis.
1,I have never wanted to burn a book before.,"Last night at about 2am after I had been reading this book for several hours hoping that SOMETHING good would happen to someone I finally gave up and went to bed. I was depressed all the next day and finally decided it was because of all of the terrible images I was left with the night before. My mood improved dramatically during dinner when I figured out I could rid myself of this bummer book by burning it, not by simply throwing the whole thing into the fire, but by burning it page by sicko page and maybe page by burning page I can get my happy self back. The author should Fall On Her Knees and beg forgiveness for what she has put her readers through. Twenty minutes later: Okay - I really did it - I burned it and I feel much better. Diana Gabaldon - here I come!"
1,A useless waste of time,"The only think I can give the author credit for is polluting my mind with foul images that evoke a sense of revulsion.The characters are believable, it's the story that is flat out sick. For that reason the book is a form of mental torture. It's like getting to know people and then watching them sink into hell.Why anyone would recommend this book is beyond me.The author can write, but she has one seriously perverse idea of life. Some things just shouldn't be written, and this is one of them. Yuck!! I'm glad I got that out of my system!"
1,A nightmare,"I have never read a book with such depressing, perverted and unredeemable characters. Ms MacDonald writes well but her subject matter is horrifying and the stuff of nightmares. I realize there are pedophiles on this earth and I know incest exists but why does she have to write of it under a pretext of a novel about family? This isn't a family I wanted to know about. If I had only been warned! My copy went to the Goodwill."
1,Life is too short to waste it on such a depressing book,"This is my first review. I'm sorry there was not the option to give it no stars. I'm driven to share my experiences with others so they are forewarned. I have never read a book that was totally hopeless. Everything that could go wrong did. Many of them were so inconceivable that I wondered if the author included all the horrible nightmares she ever had, or had heard of. I did not finish the book. Life is too short to wallow in such darkness. I put my copy in the garbage can."
2,Another Oprah,"If you like Oprah's picks, then you'll probably like this. To me, it's the same old story of a dysfunctional family, love, hate, incest, abuse, etc.etc. Ann-Marie DacDonald is a skilled writer who will get the reader involved in the ups and downs (mainly downs) of the story. The book is haunting and depressing, but very well-written. When is Oprah going to branch out? There are so many wonderful books out there."
4,a family destroyed,"This is a tragic tale, fleshed out in rather epic proportions. Put simply, it is the story of how one damaged man destroys the lives of five girls: his wife and his daughters. This book is a testament to how much damage one person can set into motion in less than a lifetime. James Pipers' actions create situations in which his family also makes bad choices, everyone in the hopes of doing some good.No matter what anyone says, Frances is the best of the sisters. Standing directly in the line of fire, she bears the brunt of James' misdeeds - being slowly destroyed - while the rest of them look the other way."
3,Featherweight Fluff,"A good friend recommended Fall On Your Knees after her son, who lives in Canada, sent her a copy. Since we share the same taste (until now) I ran out to buy the book, unable to wait until she was finished. From the beginning chapters I was disappointed and continuing to wade through, expected it to pick up and improve but it was not to be. Not only were the characters overly ecentric and unbelievably dysfunctional but did anyone catch the use of the word guesstimate? The word is a hybrid of the 90's as in 1990's and not the 1890's. By far, the most implausible part of the story was the relationship between Katheleen and Rose - puhleeze! Though I managed to finish the book, it was out of morbid curiosity as to how the author would end the suffering of the family and myself, the reader."
2,"""Fall on Your Knees"" Falls on Its Face","This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. And the sad thing is that it showed such promise during the first 150 pages. An epic of melodramatic situations, unbelievable characters, and silly plot twists that try to shock rather than tell a story. The author tries to elevate this purile contrivance by covering it with lofty language, arabic sayings (which are not translated), and religious metaphors. I guess this is what dupes some people into thinking they are reading good literature. Ms. MacDonald has succeeded in passing off this travesty as a high-minded read when in fact it is nothing more than a series of Jerry Springer episodes placed on paper. At least Springer is more honest--he doesn't try to pass himself off as Masterpiece Theatre."
1,Don't Waste Your Time on this Depressing Book!,"This book is around 500 pages and after over two weeks of reading, I found myself at page 251 and said to myself, no more. Last night I skimmed through the rest of the novel just to see if my hunches were right about the conclusion, which they were, and today, this book is going out of the house. I have never read such a depressing and unneccessary story. The author gives you small snipets into the lives of these poor people so you never get full charactor development. As a result, you don't feel sympathy for them as they endure tragedy after ridiculous tragedy. It doesn't take much to make me cry but I only shed a small tear at a death scene near the end as I had no feelings for these women. I thought the writing style was poor and very hard to read (and I made it through the English Patient and enjoyed it). I love gothic tales but this one is just too dark. Don't waste your time, there are many other good books out there."
3,Not bad for a first effort...,"...but I think Ms. MacDonald bit off too much for a first novel.She has a soaring imagination, a sharp wit...loved the names of the dolls...and an effervescent writing style. I wish she'd written a shorter, less complicated book and paid more attention to details. At least one other reviewer mentioned anachronisms. Besides the silly ""Rudolph"" mistake, she has Frances quoting lines from ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town"" before it was written. I think Ms. MacDonald's editor let her down, also, by allowing the use of language that seems more modern than early 1900s.I do think, though, that Ms. MacDonald shows great potential and I look forward to reading her next novels."
2,Not enough research,"This book is very out of touch with Catholicisim. Only in the past few years have SOME churches taken to putting a body in water. Before that, a little of it was poured onto the head. Could a 5 year old really hold those babies in her gown? Why not take the easy way and use a sink or bathtub? For that matter she could have gotten a cup of water and used that. I have never heard of a 5 year old having been confirmed. She hadn't even made her first communion!Another beef I have with the religion part is they were going to have Lily exorcised. Really! This has just about never been done and not in the 20th century - not much.Very sloppy research but an interesting story even though it is really into Catholic bashing.The writer has a way with words and a good imagination but should be more careful with her research."
2,Brought tears to my eyes... of boredom!,"An in-depth portrayal of spoiled, shallow characters with no apparent depth of their own, other than their various bouts with mental illness, which seems to impress book critics and Oprah, but bores me half to tears.I love historical fiction, but like other posters here, I made it half way through this one, hoping it would get more interesting, but finally gave up. Annoying, at best."
4,Breathtaking!,"I miss only a hundred pages but I really don't want to finish it. I was awake all nights. Wonderful plot, complex and unforgettable charachters, skillful writing. Mac Donald has find her definitive job. I bet it will a movie soon. Thank Max!"
3,Depressing!,"I have never written a book review before, but after reading this i felt compelled to share my thoughts. This book was so disturbing and depressing on so many levels that i really wish i wouldn't have finished it. Yes, it was beautifully written, but that was totally overshadowed by all the incest, child prostitution, child abuse. . I could go on. I just didn't like reading about that and feel like I can't clear it from my head. I'm not sure why so many of Oprah's book selections are so depressing? I loved East of Eden and The Story of Edgar Sawtelle, but this is nothing like those novels. There was not one character that I could relate to or even get attached to. Bummer!"
4,Falling into the waters......,"This book started out just like any other novel, than suddenly, I became immersed in the 'local creek' and found it hard to breath. The family trama's, though differnt from my ""world"", carried the same internal passion I carry to overcome daily struggles. The main character is the father, but the light is shared with troublesome daughter Frances...The family secrets flow silent, like a calm running water... and the ending... Well, you'll just have to read it.If you enjoy the little-sneak-up-on-you heart tugs. Pick this one up."
2,Every action is meant to shock and its good old quickly!,"Talk about a disconnected mess where everything is meant to shock, so much so that by the end you are numb to anything and everything that happens. I mean who cares really? I stopped caring about these selfish dullards after 50 pages, who knows why I kept reading. I surely don't."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"The first time I read this book I thought it was great, then when I re-read it I realized that just too many wierd things happened to the Piper family. If you want to read it, read it for it's depictions of New Waterford and Sydney, N.S., which are dead on."
2,Did not care for this one.,"Sorry, this novel lost me about a third of the way through with the revolting passage about the improvised Caesarean section performed by the mother on her hated nineteen year old daughter. Absolutely awful. I did not enjoy the storyline at all, nor did I enjoy Ms McDonald's writing style. This one just wasn't to my taste."
1,Refill your anti-depressants,"This was the most depressing book ever. The characters deserve better. I kept reading because I was hoping that at least one of the characters would have something good happen to them, but the tragedy gets piled on, page after page. It was as if Ann-Marie kept saying to herself with every new page ""What's the worst that could happen?"".Life is too short to waste on this hopeless book."
5,Absolutely Absorbing,"I couldn't put this book down, I read it in five days! An absolutely riveting read, a story of a doomed family in the outer regions of Nova Scotia. The book was deeply disturbing, but beautifully written. I was actually squirming at points, because it really deals with some horrible issues, but there seems to be redemption and hope at the ending. I didn't want it to end!I hope she writes a follow up soon."
2,"Plenty of sin and guilt, but where was the redemption?","I knew before reading this book that it was going to be about a deeply dysfunctional family, but that didn't quite prepare me for how truly sick this family was. The back of the book states: ""Compellingly written, by turns menacingly dark and hilariously funny, this is an epic tale of five generations of sin, guilt, and redemption."" There was definitely all manner of sin and guilt, I din't find anything hilariously funny and if there was any redemption to come out of the whole mess it passed me by. It seemed to me the whole horrible cycle was doomed to continue. The writing was very well done, but I dindn't care for the graphic sexual details. The ending was depressing to me. With all the horrible things going on in the world today I don't need to read depressing books. I expect more than that."
1,a painfully unsatisfying read,This book was very difficult to get through. The dysfunction of the Piper family was very disturbing and the novel didn't have any redeeming qualities to make up for it. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Intense,"No doubt disturbing subject matter, but I loved the writing and couldn't put it down. I wish it didn't end."
5,wow,"I finished this book and my first thought was I need someone else to read this. It is a remarkable book. Another person that reviewed this said they thought the characters weren't developed. PLEASE. Did we read the same book? Terrific characters. James was a sick man. He did not love his wife, so he transfered his feelings to his daughters. Materia was weak. Mercedes was determined. Frances was wild but a loving soul. Kathleen was sheltered and spoiled until she reached NY then she bloomed. Lily was literaly a saint. I was overwhelmed by this book. I am not a big Oprah fan but she sure can pick 'em."
2,"Well written, but creepy, and not in a good way...","I rated this book strictly according to the star system: ""I didn't like it"". That is a personal opinion and it does not mean the book was bad, in the written sense, rather that I really found myself dreading to read it and I was glad when I finished it. This book was generally creepy and unpleasant to read, and I don't mean in a horror/thriller kind of way. The writing was good, the story was coherent (after the introduction) but the characters were unhappy, selfish and miserable people, but you couldn't even hate them...I'm at a point in life where I don't want to fill my mind with whole books of people being mean to each other, and hating their own family members. There really wasn't one single character that I could look forward to here, and no good resolution in the end, to me."
2,Gothic Overload,"Upon pressing the book into my hands, my friend said it was gothic. And using this definition - ""characterized by gloom and mystery and the grotesque"" - that sums up the book neatly.There's about 80 years' worth of family gothic before there's a glimmer of sunshine in the family's otherwise mostly-miserable existence. There are some nice literary passages - fleeting, I'd say - but otherwise it is like driving by a bad accident in s-l-o-w-m-o-t-i-o-n and craning your head to look in spite of yourself. Let me list some of the tragedies: emotional abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, suicide, shunning, pathological promiscuity ...Although the author is a skillful writer, I don't think the ratio of the book's redeeming value to unrelenting misery warrants a recommendation."
5,Intense,"This is an intensely deep book that is impossible to put down from start to finish. It is the twisted story of a family in the early 1900's. The author's writing is artfully realistic. All of the characters are memorable and superbly written, leaving a lasting effect on the reader. This book isn't for those who are easily shocked or offended because the author tackles difficult topics like racial tension, homosexuality, incest, and religion. This isn't a quick read because there are hidden secrets and riddles intermingled throughout the book and I had to pay close attention to absorb them all."
3,Well it was long,I started to read this book and I got through it fast there is two reasons to get through a book fast one because you love it and two because you want to get it over with. The second one was how I felt. Very few characters in the book you actually liked. One enjoyable thing about the book was that it took place in Eastern Canada which is rare. Very sad book but if you like that kind of thing enjoy.
1,If a rating of LESS than 1 star was available...,"This book would earn it! If you enjoy reading poorly written, endless graphic accounts of incest, death, homosexuality, then this book is for you. I selected it because it was on Oprah's List. There are plenty of uplifting, truly interesting books to read. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Flawed Characters,"What starts off as a wonderful Family Saga living in Cape Breton, this novel dips, then sags and finally falls on its feet. There isn't even one character you truly care about.The family is truly sysfunctional. Think of racism, abberant behaviors, and long held secrets and you will know the basic outline of the novel.SKIP this one. What WAS Oprah thinking when she put this on her booklist?"
3,"Wow, is all I can Say","This book would've gotten more stars if the first 200 pages were quicker to read. I have to say it's a long story with a beginning that's slow and at times I didn't want to continue. I'm glad I did though. It's a bizarre, crazy, depressing and mysterious story that definitely sticks with you. It's a bit of a downer, so I wouldn't say it's for everyone and like previous posters, it dealt with serious issues and graphically. I found it moving and entertaining.Good stuff overall. Get past the beginning and it will pick up!"
1,"Disgusting, without substance.","I have read some CRAZY books in my life, but this tops the cake. I LOVE reading, and have read hundreds and hundreds of absolutely wonderful books. But geez, describing a father raping his five year old daughter, upon other stories...give me a break! Thats all this story is about: incests, life's agonies, and complete and utter stupidity. Don't read this book"
1,"Oh, Oprah, what happened?!?!!?","I have come to know that some of Oprah's book club selection can be disturbing, but as long as the story is good and moves, disturbing is okay, but this book....I always finish a book even if I'm not that thrilled with it, because I think you need to see it to the end, but about 2/3 through the book, I decided that there was no reason to put myself through such misery. None of the characters were really likeable and the story was just one negative plot after the other. The first 1/3 of the book was good, but then, it was pretty awful from then on. Don't bother, please don't bother!!!!"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This book started out different and interesting by James marrying a Lebanese 12 year old girl. About a 1/3 way through the book it goes downhill. The writing is meandering and choppy with stupid conversations between characters. The story seems surreal with all the weird stuff happening and does not quite gel. I didn't enjoy the Lesbian angle. It seems like many ""modern"" books centered on womens' trials and trevails have to throw in a Lesbian relationship because ""only women understand women."" Yuck. I usually keep all the books that come into my house but I think this one will go to Goodwill."
2,i dont even know what to say,"i sat down to read this book with the greatest expectations.. a few people had recommended it.. as i read i noticed great attention to the small details.. but at only 11 pages into the book i was suprised to see that ann-marie had not done her research.. when writing it is important to research the topic. ""...took off his jacket and began to work... he had already removed a few ivory keys and was bent behind the pianos gap toothed smile.."".. being as i play the piano and have seen the piano tuner at work many times.. i know that the piano keys DO NOT come off of a piano.. i found it hard to finish the rest of the book.. but managed to pull it off.. all in all a good book.. but sloppily arranged"
4,Amazing First Novel,"I read this novel, fighting to stay awake at 5 am so I could finish it. It was awful! It was wonderful! If a good piece of work is one that elicits strong emotions, then this is a fabulous piece of work. I finished it a week ago, but the characters are still with me. Powerful, and haunting. Not a light read, but a really satisfying one... will we hear more about Anthony & Lily? I only wish."
4,"Dark and difficult, with all manner of dysfunction.","Once I started this novel, I could not put it down. And now I can't keep the story and characters out of my mind. I was hooked from the first sentence, ""They are all dead now,"" and found myself going back to the book's prologue to review how ""they"" found their end. The book has mystery and misery, the voice of children and adults, secrets slowly revealed, and unforgettable characters. When Ann-Marie MacDonald writes about the new home the Pipers move into. ""...But just because it was new, doesn't mean it wasn't haunted,"" you know you are in for a great ride of a novel. It's a very difficult book to get through, but Ann-Marie MacDonald writes so well, that it is hard to believe this is a first novel. It spares little, and should not be missed."
4,Lovely,I was really impressed with this novel. I am recommending it to a number of friends who appreciate great storytelling.
3,"Good, but not great","""Fall on Your Knees"" was over-dramatic for my taste. It's hard not to identify with something in each of the four sisters in the story, but I've grown weary of stories about dysfunctional families. I read this book a number of months ago, and it is well written, (the characters stayed fresh in my mind) but it's really not a ""guys"" read. I'd recommend ""Home in One Piece"" by John Thompson as a story of courage and inspiration instead of this book."
5,This is a wonderful book!,"I loved this book. It's the best book I've read in several of years and I read a LOT of good books. I loved the dark, gothic nature of the story and events and was very moved by the characters and their lives. The very few events that did seem implausible (such as Lily's trip to New York in ""the dress"") added a lightness to the book that prevented it from being too sad to enjoy--unlike ""Gap Creek,"" another Oprah book that was unrelentingly sad from beginning to end and had no hint of hope in it. I wish I could read ""Fall on your Knees"" again, and I probably will."
5,ImGrateful,"Wonderful book! The writing has a character of its own and is enough to pull you into the story. Once in, you're hooked by the characters and the richly unfolding plot. One becomes part of their world and the end of the book feels like the loss of an old friend. I couldn't wait to finish it but cried when it was over."
2,SO DISAPPPOINTED,I really wanted to like this book; to LOVE it. I knew this book dealt with incest and hoped to give it to help a friend heal. Thank goodness I read it first. This is a DARK book with no redeeming quality that I could find. The only character who was sympathetic was Matteia and the author killed her off. What a waste of Ann-Marie's great talent.
2,Another Oprah Downer,"I would compare this book to the book Oprah recently had on her list ""We were the Mulvaney's"" which was not quite as depressing as this book.Oprah is a rich intellegent lady, I am not quite sure why she continues to chose books which are frankly just depressing.Although this book is well written, it was painful to read. Unless you are into this kind of struggle, I would not reccomend this book."
3,I can't decide....,"I can't decide about this book. I didn't like it all that much, it was ""hard"" reading, and I am an avid reader with a large vocab. The story kept you wondering, but most things you could figure out. I just got the impression that the author, who ...say's she ""loves surprises & secrets"" tried to overwhelm us with secrets. There was so much going on & happening, it wasn't realistic. What a [messed] up family! I would have enjoyed it more if she chose a few secrets or scandals & featured and focused on those"
3,"Compelling, Heartbreaking","This is a book that grabs you and does not let go. But it's a long, dark ride - a kind of ""The Color Purple"" set in Nova Scotia. I kept hoping for something good to happen, but whenever it did, it was soon snatched away by disaster. So if you like a good cry, this is the book for you! My other comment is that while the author makes most of the book's characters believable, the main male character (James Piper) is about as realistic as a unicorn. He's described in such a way that you might feel some sympathy for him...he's a man who knows his demons (such as his sexual attraction to young girls), tries to control them, and fails, making him a tragic figure. Sorry, there's no such thing. People like that are just predators, and I found it disturbing that the author tried to make us feel sorry for this character."
2,Falling out of interest,"Had trouble with the voices. Did like the changing viewpoints but each voice remained static. Almost like each character remains a child to the point you lose track of each of their ages.The torment by Catholicism--stereotypical, overwrought. Just don't see the value of going into these dark waters. No balance, no triumph for any character, nothing learned.The inter-ethnic/religious relationships were interesting. Lily's character could have delved into how those with handicaps dealt with/overcame prejudice. The repetitious gore serves no purpose after awhile."
5,Beautiful yet ugly! You will love this book!,"Read this book! No matter what words I use in this review this book is so good it's greatness isn't even explainable into words.This has the best book I've read so far. This novel contains so many great suprises, it's full of passion, mystery, love, and betrayal. Ann-Marie MaDonald is a god when it comes to writing this novel. This book can't be subjected to one category of books it's everything all roled into one, and it's written in complete detail, so it becomes a great movie in your mind and you can't put the book down. I have recommended this book to everyone and anyone I know."
1,the worst of family relationships,"The writing was descriptive and held my interest, but the story line covered nearly evey perversion a family can enter into. I finished the book totally depressed. It is sad enough that human beings do not respect each other in real life, but tragic to spend your leisure time reading about it. This had to be the most disfunctional family I have read about. Sorry I could not recommend this book to anyone."
5,of course oprah said yes,"If I was going to be in isolation for the rest of my days and I was allowed to take three fiction and three non-fiction books, Fall On Your Knees would be a part of my collection. A great story, superbly told, full of insight and hidden treasure."
1,Good writing with a shock-shlock exploitation plot.,"The writing carries you along so well that it's not until you've slogged through a good 300 pages that you realize that this is Flowers in the Attic-quality shlock. The ""shocks"" are, of course, incest and homosexuality. The plot points are, of course, pregnancies. This is Jerry Springer dressed up, as predictable as can be. The lesbian twist barely struggles above exploitation, but is still the most interesting and convincingly written part of the book, possibly because it includes actual emotions.I actually threw this book away when I was done with it, something I rarely do."
3,"Grim, but entertaining","I wanted to Kill Francis, then toward the end I wanted to hug her.I tried to stop reading the book but felt I must go on just so I could find out what really happen to Kathleen. I still wasn't quite clear about the babies and who the father was.entertaining book. I'd read something else by her."
1,Horribly Depressing,"This is one of the most horribly depressing books I have ever read. I found that I was in a miserable mood the entire time I was involved in this story. I cannot believe the ""author"" couldn't come up with something more creative to write. I only continued with the hope of peace. She looked for the most devestating things to write and put it down on paper whether it made sence or not. She is trying shock treatment to make a name for herself. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME!"
2,disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book. For one, it says ""novel"" on the cover, and two, Oprah picked it for her book club. I admit that after i saw it on her show i had to pick up the book. I had expected it to be as great as they said it was. However, I am smack in the middle of the book struggling my way to finish so that I may start my lord of the rings series. Not only does this book take forever to get to the point, but it has really horrible grammar for a published writer. Yes i will struggle a little more and try to make my money's worth for this book, but I highly doubt that it will end any differently than the begginning..which is very confusing..she's dead then she's alive oh opps she's dead again.. a little confused? don't get this book! trust me it's a waste of money."
1,ugh...not another father incest and baby death book,"At first I thought the book started out with a bang, I couldn't put it down for the first 100 pages, then the reader is hit with the father incest stuff (boring and over done), the baby dying and not one likable character in the book (what was the Francis having a baby for Lily if she didn't even keep it to raise about?!). I kept hoping because the writing was decent that there would eventually be a redeeable person in the book. No luck and I didn't even finish the last twenty pages."
1,SICK,"INCEST, RAPE, CHILD ABUSE, ALCHOLISM, LESBIANISM, MIXED RACE RELATIONSHIP WITH A TRANSVESTITE ,MURDER, SUICIDE, MENTAL ILLNESS ALL TO ONE FAMILY. HOW UNBELIEVABLY DEPRESSING."
1,Incestuous and revolting,"Wow - I can't believe that so many people liked this book. I thought that the underlying themes of incest and abuse were warped and disgusting, although I must admit, riveting at the same time. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone with a history of sexual or physical abuse, since its graphic and sometimes overly realistic descriptions turned my stomach."
1,Better have your Prozac handy . . . .,"This was perhaps the most depressing book I've ever read, even worse than Angela's Ashes! There were few truly likeable characters in it, and far too many deaths. I can't recommend this book unless you feel like developing a bad case of the blues."
5,"Exceptional Story, A Fresh Writing Style","If this book does not captivate you, you don't like novels about a family's history through the generations. The style of writing as well as the story grips you and keeps you going through to the very end. After I finished this book I wanted to visit with all the girls in the novel. They were all interesting characters.Some Oprah's pick's have been disappointed,not this one. If you can't get to it right away, definately add it to your list of books to read.The story is written by a woman from Toranto, Canada. It takes place in the Nova Scotia area which provides a new geographic twist."
3,Help ! I have 3 questions....,1.) Who is the father of Kathleens' babies?2.) Is Rose a man or a woman?3.) What is Kathleen=Rose supposed to mean? (on the family tree)I did not think the book was clear at the ending as to the answer to these questions.
1,Too Bad They Don't Give Negative Stars as an Option!,"If this is someone's idea of great Canadian fiction, I promise to never read another Canadian -penned book again! This was awful. Someone should have told this author that brevity is virtue. I like descriptive narratives, but there's no need to just keep going just for the sake of writing a bigger novel. This story was unbelievable and filled with people with warped characters, morals and consciences. Everyone hated eveyone in the book (exept for all the twisted sexual encounters) and I was quite happy to hate them back. Please, don't listen to people telling you this is so great! It was terrible, don't waste your time or money!"
4,Epic and Entertaining,"This multi-generational book dives into many of the themes Oprah chosen books have covered before but mostly in it's version of a dysfunctional home.Here it's a Nova Scotian family of girls each finding there way in the world with various results. Mercedes is the God fearing good daughter, Francis the rebellious, and Kathleen the vocally talented chosen one who catches her fathers eye.Although the book touches on some taboo areas like incest, it's never done to shock, and is handled with sensitivity to the reader. A well written first novel."
3,Overwrought; lovely writing style,"As a fan of Canadian literature, I really wanted to like this book. I finished it, but the experience was like rubbernecking at a train wreck. At some point, I just stopped caring about any of the characters. The traumas and tribulations were just never ending, with all the subtlety of a John Phillips Sousa march. The plot started to remind me of a Monty Python skit - oh, yes, well, THAT horrible calamity happened? Well, top THIS! You have to go pretty far over the top for me to start inadvertently laughing (at some truly horrible things) when the next tragedy hits.On the flip side, the picture of Cape Breton culture at the turn of the century was lovely, and the Lebanese history was fascinating. And MacDonald really turns out some beautiful prose. But... overall... the book was sufficiently melodramatic and overwrought that it was not a pleasant reading experience."
2,"Sorry, but...","I HATE doing this, but I have now closed Fall on Your Knees and will not bother opening it again. I struggled to about the halfway point, but can go no further.It's not that it's badly written... in fact the prose in places is beautiful. It's not that there's no story... there's bucket-loads of story and the reader is dragged through it at a rate of knots that is sometimes breathtaking. And maybe that's the problem. So far, we've not stopped long enough in one place to care for any of the characters.I really don't care what happens to any of them!Honest, I struggled and struggled to keep going, but boredom finally broke me and I've given up. As one astute reviewer puts it ... ""The traumas and tribulations were just never ending, with all the subtlety of a John Phillips Sousa march"" ... Well here's a de Sousa fan who prefers the marches!Sorry, but..."
1,Too Melodramatic to be Believed,"I found this book to be quite disappointing. Though the writing style is creative and evocative, the plot is quite unbelievable and melodramatic to the point of absurdity. The narrative would have been so much stronger if MacDonald had used one family tragedy as the epicenter of a storm that would engulf this family. Then the reader could focus on how each character responds and how the delicate interconnection of family relationships is compromised and impacted by the actions of all other family members. Instead, MacDonald appears to feel that readers need to be needlessly entertained by a new tragedy every few chapters until I finally found myself asking, ""Could there possibly be any other horrible thing that could happen to this one family?"""
4,"Well written, riveting...","This book was very well written. I felt that the writer must have experienced some of these tragedies or studied them, because her characters had some very real reactions to the blows life kept dealing them.At times - over the top - but very riveting until the very end."
5,Smoke and Mirrors,"This is an incredible tale in which things are not always what they seem. The characters are vividly alive in this heartbreaking story of a family for which ""dysfunctional"" does not seem strong enough a word. MacDonald is a brilliant writer with a talent for putting the reader inside the mind of her characters."
3,be prepared when readin this novel,"it is written in a very different way, past, present, fragments and extreme ""rambling"". It does keep the reader wondering and contiuing to read to see why but the subject matter of ""insest and child abuse"" makes it very disturbing. Many have mentioned that it keeps you thinking about it for weeks but that is only because you cannot believe the whole story or the ending and the ""subject"" haunts you."
2,I wouldn't recommend it to my best friend,"A gripping tale but only because it delves into all the worse human behaviours. I personally don't appreciate such trash and can't understand all the positive reviews that I read and that pushed me into buying this book. There is not one single positive character in the whole story and even the good ones are hateful. I've never come across a greater bunch of crazy people. Rape, incest, murder, prostitution, homosexuality ... a mixture of elements that leads absolutely nowhere, if not to disgust and boredom."
2,Laboring,"Just about every family in the world has some level of dysfunction, but this family is beyond the pale, making the story basically unbelievable and the majority of the characters unlikable. I found this novel to be hugely disappointing."
1,A tedious read,This is possibly the most disgusting book I have ever tried to read and the only one I can think of that I quit on half way through. I can see no redeeming qualities in the plot or the characters. I really don't understand the four star reviews.
2,"Overwrought, Overwordy, Overdone","I cannot recommend Fall on Your Knees. While it is well-written, the story is just a series of tragedy piled upon tragedy. After a while, I couldn't care at all about any of the characters because I knew they were all doomed, and there was nothing in them to like anyway. This is the story of a Canadian family which essentially destroys itself. Reading it is like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over again."
2,Great beginning turned into a silly ending,"I was so impressed with this novel until about the middle of it. Instead of ending there - where it should have - the author dreamt up ghosts to keep it going. Then all the characters (""all"" the characters) seemed to flip out and none of their ""eccentricities"" were set up properly.Then everyone became twisted except the one who the most selfish and horrible from the start. And every ""secret"" and twist of the plot were telegraphed so loudly, I wished I could turn my hearing down.I think this writer has a wonderful voice and quite an imagination, but the novel suffers from its length, its callous disregard for the characters, its tendency toward explotative ""shocks"" for titillation, and the extremely weak ending. I can only recommend the novel up until the birth of the twins (vague, on purpose!), after that the novel reads like a very twisted sort of Lady Chatterly's Lover meets Justine.Pass."
2,"I'm not a cat person, but ...","I'm sorry. I don't get how all these people can love this unlovable book. Okay, so I give it 2 stars for construction, narration, and evocation, but coming from the land down under (south of the Mason-Dixon line, and the home turf of the likes of such dreary folks as William Faulkner and Walker Percy) I'm acquainted with dark and crazy characters. But do we really want such an un-relenting view of childhood terrorism? Little, if any, emphasis is put on any redeeming characterics of any single character, and none of it was really worth killing the cat."
1,"Poor quality, poor value","This CD is of such poor quality that it really gives Israeli music a bad name. Although the choir and band are reasonably skilled, the recording quality is so bad that it is hard to tell. The entire record sounds as though this was recorded just outside the room of a Bar Mitzvah party, but using 50 year old equipment. If you're looking for good introduction to Israeli music, check out something that also contains ""Yerushalyim Shel Zahav"" and ""Ani V'Atah."""
1,Poor CD,"I happen to love Hava Nagila and bought this CD just for that song. Unfortunately, it came out sounding ""canned"". I have found beautiful renditions of it by Helmut Lotti and the Budapest Klezner Band. Either is a far superior choice."
2,Spidey senses are tingling...,"This would be great if the band had done a couple of things, differently. It's got all the best intentions in the world, but, alas there is no subtlety behind their (deep) lyrics. By all this I mean... take for example the chorus, for nearly every song is the exact song title, which, by the way, all sound like the titles to ""b"" horror flicks (ie. ""Sex and Mayhem""). Amongs all this, ~ahem... mayhem, there is a quiet beauty to the musical side of things. I really STARTED to like this EP just as soon as I put it in the player.So,... let's get down to brass tacks: All the potential in the world can't help you, if you've got a song called, ""Sex and Mayhem"".To steal a phrase from oneof my heroes.""Nuff said'"""
5,Good product at a good price.,I used this to replace the battery in my NiteRider TrailRat. This is the second time that I have done this and I am still very happy.
4,Good battery to use with so;ar charger,got this battery as a back up to the main battery in my solar electric fence charger. good price. and quality.
5,lantern battery,"I ordered this for a lantern i bought at a salvage store,so I didn't want to spend much. I think this will work great. I received it in 3 days and it works great so far. I priced one in town and it was 21 dollars ,this one was 10. I love getting a good deal."
4,oliver137shop@yahoo.com,got battery charged it for two it wouldnt take a charge strom came light not working what else can i say it didnt work not a happy camper
5,Cheap fix for old lantern.,"I used this to replace an old failed battery in Coleman CCFL lantern. Arrived quickly and working fine.It's a battery, not much to say about it!"
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,Amazon does not warn the buyer that this book is approximately two inches in size! way too small!!! extremely overpriced - almost $5.00 for a book that I could turn into a Christmas tree ornament! a BIG disappointment!
2,Rather SMALL,"Was totally shocked when I opened the package and found a book the size of a post it note. Truly, it was no larger than3"" x 3"" . No indication that it was going to be that small."
3,does the job,"not that fancy, good for basic jobs. used it to apply gel medium on canvas. probably wouldn't use for anything too fancy."
5,Bicycle Tire's,The tires were a little pricy but they were exactly what we were looking for.They have been mounted on the bike and have been taken for a test spin.
3,The Reviews here are a little Overly Optimistic,"This book has a predictable plot line with a twist -> the tough guy for the mafia is actually a gal, and she falls in love with the bosses daughter. But it's like the author couldn't decide if she was writing a true crime thriller or a romance. The true crime part was better written. The romance aspect is trite and over-written with some of the worst and most unrealistic descriptions of sex than I have ever seen. Come on--who can get into all these positions? The SnM aspects were also odd and out of place. Do lesbians really talk like that to each other? Strange. I did like a lot of the book, and the ending is way good, but the author could use some help with making the middle part seem real. Tumbleweed Fever was written much better."
5,AWESOME! A MUST READ!,"If you haven't read this book yet, then I suggest you buy it first thing! I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it. I did not get anything done until I had the book finished. L.J. Maas created characters here that you will absolutley fall in love with. They became real to me.There was just the right emount of action, love scenes,(and what beautiful love scenes they were!),drama and mystery all roled into one book! I read it twice and am now going to read it again because I love the characters soooo much! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER BOOKS BY L.J.MAAS! She is now my favourite author."
3,Too much steam,"Maas is a pretty decent writer, but this instance of her work is so full of ""steamy bits"" that the story and characters only take up a small fraction of the page count. If you're looking for highly detailed, very descriptive erotic writing of two women going at it, this may be for you. I tend to flip past that to read the story. In this case, that meant I paged past ~50% of the book (or so it seemed). It was a bit frustrating to find so little here, because I do enjoy her stories. YMMV."
5,L. J Maas---- an enchantress,"L.J.Maas has captured my heart! She weaves a story of friendship, love, passion, intrigue, compassion and suspense.I've read this book twice and loved it as much the second time.I highly recommend Meridio's Daughter. L. J. Maas has fast become a favorite author and I'm looking forward to her other works as well!"
3,Nice Amp,"I have been playing guitar for a while, and decided to get an electric guitar. I purchased a Les Paul, and this amp. This amp is pretty good. There is no hiss at all, which is really great. None of the nobs crackle, and the body feels strong. I don't like the built-in effects. If you are buying this for effects, don't. They sound thin and cheap, except for the echo. Also, you cannot get a real clean sound because a preset is always changing it a little. I f you want effects, it would be better to get actual pedals.However, if you are on a budget, this would be a good amp. It has all the things you want in a first amp. If it is your first amp, then you should buy it.PROS:No hisssolid constructiongood priceCONS:bad sounding effectsto many adjustments needed to make a clean sound.If this is your first amp, buy it."
4,Cuban Conquers The Mystery,An outstanding read - full of the twists and turns you expect in a world class mystery. The undercurrent of immigrant life - particularly Cuban immigrant life - is compelling and poignant. A real winner!
3,Jose' Latour - Not at his best,"I am a bit surprised by the reviews I have read of this book. I have read three of Jose Latour's books. I found this one to be the least interesting. The story started out interesting while it was set in Cuba. Once the teacher left Cuba, the story became a bit convoluted. I didn't find the characters to warrant my interest."
3,storage boxes,"beautiful boxes, and great boxes. much smaller than i had expected and you cannot store much in them."
4,Perfect for DVDs,"We use this box to hold DVDs in our van. It slides right under the center console and provides one bit of organization to a very messy van. <sigh>Built sturdy, the leather look is perfect for what I envisioned."
1,Ridiculous price,On Oriental art supply site this book sells for $24.95. I am interested in Ning Yeh books and did a further search than on your site and was shocked to see the difference in price. This should be reviewed.
5,chinese brush painting,This is a great book for a beginner who is trying brush painting all by them selves. It has a great reference of what you need to buy to start out and even a list of more expensive brushes that are worth their price. It shows you what you are painting step by step as well as shows pictures of what other people did to help you with composition. It starts with the four gentlemen of brush painting and a couple of things you can paint using these brush strokes. It also explains mounting techniques for the painting and how to frame it.A good beginner book. And the best thing is he has a video/dvd series that can show you how to paint different things. Anything made by the author is worth buying.
3,Not quite what I thought,"I thought the book would have more illustrations, step by step on how to actually draw; so a little disappointed"
4,New Author writes a Winner!!,"What a start to a writing career, gripping, intense, descriptive and a damm good read, well researched and had me salivating for the "" second instalment"", how many authors start off with something this good. Take some time to get in to it and you won't be putting it down....great debut, now lets get the second book out there..."
5,Dark atmosphere and then some...,"First off, Nick Stone is a very good writer. Supeb even, but for a few minor flaws - otherwise he wouldn't have won Britain's Silver Dagger award. What he paints best is dark atmosphere, layers and layers of it in this gumshoe classic which takes a Miami cop into voodoo land.The scene in the trailer park with another detective is a classic. Flies buzzing and smell before we come to the dreaded cause of them. So much so that you're dreading Max Mingus's trip to Haiti to discover what's happened to a missing child before he's even stepped on the plane. I notice some readers here merely pegging this for a modern day Chandler-type book, or an extension of Lehane or Coben's early detective series - but what they are missing here is style. Pure and simple. Sometimes these layers are a tad too heavy - such as the UN soldier-local drug lord scene - but these are small complaints in an otherwise rollercoaster thrill ride."
1,Mr. Cliche,"I have no idea why this book has almost a four-star rating. It's filled with useless adjectives and repetitive passages to the brim. The 70 pages I managed to get through might as well have been 30 pages. Oh, I forgot about the cliched phrases that had me saying 'Give me a break' every other paragraph. Do yourself a favor and if you don't findMr. Clarinet: A Novel (Max Mingus Thriller)capturing your attention within the first 30-40 pages, give up and move on to something worth your time."
1,More than a little disappointed.,"Bought this book based on a review I read in the local paper. I am a fan of mystery thrillers especially Sanford, Kellerman, Corban, Lehane, Connelly and others. I am always looking for new authors to enjoy. Unfortunately this book was very disappointing to me. Slow to start and finish and more a treatise on Haiti than anything else."
3,Not a Very Polished Effort,"I didn't finish this book. It started off slow and didn't accelerate as it moved forward. It seems the author tried too hard to make Max Mingus into a tough private eye, but his effort only seemed to be a parody of other P.I.'s in the genre. I guess what really bothered me is that the author didn't write with authority. As other reviewers have noted, the book seems too formulaic. It didn't flow. It didn't have ""the touch."" I hope Stone can develop his skills in future books. This just didn't cut it for me."
4,tips for writing your essay,"One of the most useful of the essay collections for college applicants.Tips are good, and well-organized. It is great to be able to read actual ""winning"" essays. At first read, I was far less than impressed with many of them. I wished for a more specific critiquing system, as in ""Fifty Successful Harvard Application Essays,"" also available thru amazon. (In contrast, the Harvard Crimson book actually includes critiquing on every essay... reader can see what qualities made the essay a winner, and also some ideas on what could have made it even better).But in general, the tips are good, and this should be a guide for ALL high school students who wish to write better essays.Oh, yes. After using this book as a guide, my son got accepted, early decision, into a great school. So that's worth a few stars."
5,Buy it!,"Love this collection! For anyone teaching students how to write personal essays or how to prepare college essays, you have to see the model essays in this collection -- if for no other reason than to read and show off the introductions. Students who have spent four years writing for standardized tests will find these openings fresh and inviting -- a welcome departure from the formulaic. This collection reminds us what professional writing looks like and reminds us that writing should be a pleasure to read."
2,The first half is awful!,"The first half of this album is horrid! It sounds like a bad mariachi (sp?) band. However, the last half is very good and very danceable."
2,strange vocals and tinny sound quality,Hi I agree with the other reviewer this isn't the best cd out there. I have listened to it enough to acquire a taste for most the songs though so the music is interesting in a strange sort of way. Some of the songs have very nice beats but the vocals will scare many people from wanting to hear them while you dance lol. I've often wished this cd was recorded with higher quality too... it sounds almost as if recorded in mono instead of dolby or stereo.
3,Traditional Sound,"This CD contains many selections of folk-sounding music. There are no liner notes, or any notes at all. The sound quality is inconsistent. It's a good (not great) collection of traditional-sounding M.E. music. Twenty-five tracks makes for a pretty sizable collection on 1 CD.I recommend this CD mostly because it's got a number of songs on it that seem to me to have cultural value. It's easy to imagine hearing these songs on the streets of the market in the Middle East. People who prefer traditional music to dance to will appreciate All the Best of Belly Dancing. I do think it's a good addition to a collection of M.E. music, but I also think there are better. Buy this one, but buy it used."
2,Not belly dance music!,"This isn't really belly dance music - it's Roumanian Gypsy music, folk music and Debke - which is not traditionally used for belly dance. It is danceable - but if you're looking for a belly dance compliation there are better ones out there. Also, the sound quality is AWFUL, the drums are very ""boomy"" - poor recording."
1,Horrible!,"This is one of those movies that you sit and watch to the end to see what comes out of this boring, immoral production!!!I just don't get the point! Is this supposed to be entertainment?"
2,Disappointed,"There's plenty of music to play, but I've been rather disappointed with it. I, personally, would not recommend this book to a friend. I found the arrangements lacking and very unsatisfying. For some pieces, the most ""enjoyable"" part of the music is missing. I really just don't think the sheet music was written very well in this book. That may just be my opinion, but this is one book that will be collecting dust on my shelf. There are much better books out there than this one."
5,"UK product ""OUTLOUD""","This is the UK product launched by TDK which is closest to I'm a Speaker.Bought one as gift for relative at Xmas.Having since heard it in action, I will now buy one for myself!"
2,Major design flaw,"Our 4 year old son received this toy for Christmas. He really liked playing with it, and it was a lot of fun for him, with so many different games to play. However, you need to squeeze Mr. Scrambles left hand to activate certain things, and his arm easily becomes detached. So, you have to peel back the cover and push the arm back into the outlet. To add to the frustration, the arm constantly becomes disconnected. I'm not sure why the company designed it this way, but it wasn't a good idea. We still play with Mr. Scrambles, but dealing with the arm issue is irritating."
3,OK toy,"I got this for my grandson when he was 4, he played with it a little while but I haven't seen it for months. I guess it did not hold his interest for too long a time."
5,Great Movie for kids and adults,This movie is great if you read the book Stormbreaker or if you are new to the story. Thought it was a kid's movie and was surprised how much I liked it.
4,My son would have given it 5 stars,"Since my son (age 10) loves the Alex Rider books, I bought him the movie. He thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't think the young man playing Alex was right for the role, I didn't like the way they portrayed Jack, and I thought the movie was too short and the characters too one-dimensional. But it was entertaining and just right for my son's interests."
3,"That Is, It's OK If You Like Blond Teen British Boys","Yes, the ""tags"" say it all, this film is about a sweet-looking though potentially lethal British teen-turned-spy. The storyline, aside from his clever recruitment and neat cameos by Ewan MacGregor and Stephen Fry, is unworthy to be divulged......but DO NOT miss the chance to see Bill Nighy flex his comedy muscles as a Nazi-looking agency director. A fun, made-mostly-for-tweens spy film, with some suprisingly good acting and a terrific martial arts sequence.By the way, Mickey Rourke almost made a comeback with this film. Shame that he, like his character Darius Snell, got ""pooped"" on by a British schoolboy. That's OK, because HE got to do ""The Wrestler"", and where the hell is Alex now?!"
3,Well...,"Nothing like the book. I know this is common, but honestly, a little much here...Second, one of the only reasons to watch this movie is because ""Obi-Wan"" is in it!!!Avoid unless you want kind of nonsensical action with some interesting twists."
5,Great movie!,"I am a huge fan of the A.R. series, and when i heard they did a movie on Book 1, i was dying to go see it. The movie is great, it is a tiny bit better than the book. The charecters are great:Alex Rider: handsome,great role for Alex RiderAlan Blunt: great comic relief, eccentricMrs. Jones: very smart, acts like Blunt's mother.Jack Starbright: nice to see Batgirl from Batman and Robin playing JackDarrius Sayle: one problem, in the book he is Herold Sayle, but still a great role.Great movie. Its rated PG for sequences of action violence, and some peril."
4,Alex Rider operation stormbreaker,Great movie for kids. Lots of action and cool gadgets. Good story line. Ihope they make another one.
2,haven't even gotten it yet,"This is not a review of the movie---haven't even received it yet! This is an older movie but pre/early teens are into the books and now want the movie. This is not serviced by Amazon and is coming from overseas! Either I didn't read the info carefully or the info wasn't clear but, after I placed the order I received notification that it would be delivered sometime late January. I tried to expedite it and that was when I found out why it would take so long. Tried to cancel but suddenly it was already shipped---all this taking place within less than 24 hours! Since i did not want to disappoint my grandaughter, I found it on Movies Unlimited--in time for Christmas. Suggest you do the same."
3,Their are better spys out their,"This movie is okay. I'd much rather watch a James Bond movie or a Mission Impossible, though. The acting is pretty good, though their are some pretty bad/chessy parts. I guess this movies worth a shot, if you like spy movies.PS the book is better."
3,Looks Good,"The item is attractive, but the shank of the hitch insert is constructed from plastic. Not what I expected."
1,Red letters wore off immediately!,The GMC red letters on this completely wore off almost immediately. Now it's all silver. Whatever. Plastic crap. Need I say more?
3,Nice looking but..............,"Very nice looking hitch cover. Chrome metal face ,but the mounting portion is plastic.So if I go to a car wash that has the spinning brushes,it breaks it right off.Would be nice if it were ALL metal."
2,"Well short of a true ""shop manual.""","This manual is helpful, and might save me some money by helping me to do things myself. But it is nowhere near a true shop manual. A lot of common tasks are omitted entirely, and others are covered in excessive detail.They also try to cover a wide range of engines, and drives, and model years in a single book. As a result, at least 2/3 of the book is irrelevant to you since it covers engines, drives and model years other than yours. Procedures for newer engines are just lumped into a final chapter, rather than being inserted into the text where they apply.I don't regret the purchase, but it is not what I had hoped for."
1,Save Your Money,I purchased this shop manual to aid me in winterizing my boat. This manual was of little or no help. The owners manual provided with the engine did a far better job. This manual covers such a wide range of engines that it is cluttered and difficult to navigate. I was very disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone that is not already familiar with Marine engine repair.
4,She's good,She's got a strong voice and quite some fame in Japan - but her debut was a bit better. It's still good and silky soul though
1,A Collection of Clip-Art with Arabic Text,"Dont dissapoint yourself with this book, It is NOT a dictionary. It is an alphabetical collection of clip-art with Arabic and English text identifying the object.Additionally it should mention that it is in the Egyptian dialect, and formal Arabic as opposed to the everyday spoken Arabic."
4,Great Help,This dictonary was really helpful. The pictures clearly show what most of the words are. I really suggest using this book for beginers learning Arebic or English.
2,Review of Hineini in our lives,"At first I wasn't too impressed, but this book is not so bad. It is an interesting take on applying the bible to everyday relationships. However I don't like the 'other' emphasis because I prefer the more chasidic perspective of striving for unity and communion with God rather than separation. However, if I replace 'other' with something more meaningful to me I benefit from the book. It is really about relationships with others and with oneself. Its use of the characters in the bible to illustrate this is interesting. Now I would give it 3 to 3 1/2 stars."
5,So Saucy,Baby Bash has a unique sound to him. And i love it. this album is off tha chain. Strongly recomended
2,Needs Some Growth,"I must admit I bought this for the song: ""Baby I'm Back"" which is on smash.....but the rest fails to impress. There is maybe one or two more songs besides that song that are alright. But, he just does not sound like he has mastered his game yet. I like the voice of Natalie who is featured on 2 of the songs as well as Avant on 1 of the tracks....that's about all it has going for it."
5,Baby Bash has lots of Platinum potential!,"I am a very big fan of Bash's album, The Smokin Nephew. I'm still bumpin' that cd in my car at least twice a week. With Super Saucy, Bash brings some hits wit new artist Akon and Natalie and even goes old skool with Nate Dogg and and E-40. Bash is a real artist with lots of potential, with so much competition in the rap main stream it's good to hear an artist who doesnt follow suit. ""Baby, Im Back"", ""That's My Lady"", and ""Outro"" show proof of Platinum potential. Bash is definately on his way to being more than just another rapper, Baby Bash will soon be an Icon."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,DA SMOKIN NEWPHEW DID IT AGAIN!!! GREAT CD!! I LOVE IT...I LOVE EVERY SONG ON DA ALBUM!!! I GOTTA SAY BABY BASH DID IT AGAIN...ANOTHER GREAT CD FROM HIM TO MY COLLECTION!!!! YAYYYYYY!!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS CD FOR A LONGGGG TIME AND FINALLY I HAVE IT!!!! I PROBABLY LISTEN TO THE WHOLE CD MORE THAN 10 TIMES TODAY!!! IMA BE LISTENING TO IT 24-7 !!! SO IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THIS CD GO GET IT...ITS AWESOME YOUR GONNA LOVE IT ALSO!!!!!!!
4,Not quite what I was expecting :-l,"This is a good cd - it's just that it wasn't quite what I thought it would be like. I've got their other cd and I loved that. I love their style of music, but this was a little over rap heavy in some parts. Their sound is always great, but to me there are only three stand out songs. I love Who's Wit Me, Obsession (great version) and Baby I'm Back. They are fantastic songs. Baby Bash are a great group and this is a great cd, it's just that I didn't end up liking as many songs as I hoped I might."
2,"Wow, this is bad!!!!","Yes, this cd is bad, but does it warrant wishing that he get shot outside a club? Would you want someone to wish that on you. That is bad. There are a few good songs on here only because of the beat, hook, and guest artist. Baby Bash himself, wow. His rapping style is horrible. The lyrics are bad as well. But hey, he has a deal and I don't."
1,THIS GUY IS A JOKE!,WOW THIS CD SUCKS. wHO IS THIS GUY KIDDING? AND WHAT KIND OF NAME IS BABY BASH? TO THOSE THAT BOUGHT THIS CD YOU ARE A SUCKER CAUSE YOU WASTED YOUR MONEY!
5,! Baby Bash: Sauc'in Up Urban Music !,"If you thought Urban influenced music only came from big cities out of the East and West Coast, boy are you in for a surprise.""Super Saucey,"" Bash's sophmore album, is full of soothing sounds marinated with his seductively saucey voice, introducing audiences from different walks of life to his personal musical stylings. Already in the top 10 on the Rhythm Crossover Chart, it is the #1 most requested track in its first week of radio. Gold artist, Akon not only produced Bash's first single, ""Baby I'm Back,"" but he was one of the many features which include, R&B superstart Avant, L.A. phenomenon Nate Dogg, as well as fellow latin artists making their presence known; Chingo Bling, and Pitbull. The whole vibe of this new ""urbanized "" album has proven that this Musical Chef knows how to keep the audience he is entertaining coming back for seconds."
3,READ MY ARTICLE,"YEAH I DIG BABY BASH. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN SINCE 95' BUT HIS ALBUM ""ON THA COOL"" MAKE THIS ONE SOUND LIKE GARBAGE. SO TO ALL YOU WHO DON'T LIKE THIS ONE OR THINK IT'S TIGHT CHECK THAT ONE OUT. YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THIS MOVIE WTF,"i paid for this movie. i never received this movie!!wtf you guys are a complete ripoff, i sent you 2 separate emails months ago. you guys suck. you guys suck. you guys ripped me off and you guys suck."
1,not so good,"not what i thought it was at all and should had been clearer in the description, also came late. thanks"
2,"Much hype, much hope; flabby policy prescriptions.","This book promises much but aside from confirmingthat many job producing firms have left the ghettos,it leaves much to be desired. The policyprescriptions are flabby and poorly reasoned,especially considering the immense cost ofimplementing them. Considering the hype thatwraps the book (front cover and back), it is muchado about little."
2,Lets correlate joblessness with everything,"This book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society. We can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to. While Wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate, his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling ""sorry for them""."
2,Too academic - not palatable for the curious reader,"I am fascinated by economics, sociology and the cycles of wealth and poverty. I hoped this book would offer good insight into the causes of the problems of urban poverty and offer some hope about how to improve the lives of people in the ghetto.It did offer some valuable insights, and I'm glad I read it, but it was so heavily laden with statistics and descriptions of research that it was hard to stay attuned to the overall story and message.Probably a good book for an academic - not very enjoyable for the casual, curious reader."
3,Is the Data Clean?,"I read this book and had serious doubts about some of the data. It seems like the prose changes in the quotes and the interviewers were feeding jargon to the respondents a little too much for comfort. Also, I have doubts about the scope of the interviews (i.e. did the researchers really interview enough black employers to support their findings about their preferences for employees in all situations?)."
2,"Cute idea, but don't waste your money.","I sent this to my mother, who is an avid gardener, for her birthday. While I love the idea and the design, the seeds never grew and she ended up with just an egg."
3,it kept dying,"I think this plant managed to die 3 times before I called it quits. The plant also started growing mold and fungus on the sprouts, even though the plant was indoors away from the elements that usually plague wild strawberry plants. I might try again some day, but not any time soon."
4,excellent,"Stan Kenton was a big band leader who did did some daring big band albums in the 1950s and 1960s. One of his best wasAdventures in Jazz. But Kenton also loved to retool music that was hugely popular. In 1961, he rearranged the score forKenton's West Side Story.Hair was as big in the late 1960s as West Side Story was early in the decade. You'll never mistake this for any of the Hair cast albums. Kenton uses big band charts for the ""tribal love rock musical"" to own this music.But it is excellent, and if you are looking for a fresh take on this music that was recorded by so many during the era, being so popular, you won't go wrong hearing Kenton's little piece of the spirit of the age."
4,More beans than I know what to do with.,"I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65? One click and several months later and here I am. I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them. I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have ""surprise jelly beans"" when I'm not expecting it.The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box. No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard. There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated."
3,received wrong DVD format from seller,"I ordered this and it lists as NTSC on the website. The seller shipped the dvd, but it was PAL format, not NTSC. In process of requesting a return and hopefully an exchange for the NTSC version on DVD.Bummer. Was hoping to watch this this weekend.Otherwise I have seen footage and it looks awesome.barcode of PAL version is5 036369 806996product code on spine isEVDVD069"
3,A bit boring in the beginning,The firts two songs are so tacky. Even the Dio's songs was silly. But when the BAND come to stage... getting better!
5,Deep Purple 30 yrs later !,"Nice DVD...starts out mellow, with guest vocalists and the orchestra with Jon Lord in charge. Concerto for Group and Orchestra kicks in, and is great. Differences in the '69 version for sure (which is worth buying, also). The group rocks out more..all original members except Blackmore replaced by Steve Morse who can handle the guitar duties great. would have been a great concert to have been at--they did it all."
5,amazing purple,"As others mentioned before, this video is great.What impresses me the most is the excellent performance of Steve Morse.Watching him play his guitar is absolutely fabulous.I was lucky enough to see the live show of this concerto twice,once in Belgium and the other time in Holland.The video differs slightly from those life performances.It's a pitty that the tape does not include ""Night meets light"" and the beautiful intro to ""Smoke on the water"".What I regret the most however, is the fact that the camera is not always focused on Steve Morse while he is soloing.For instance there are a few moments of amazing guitarwork during ""Pictures of home"" where the camera is showing members of the orchestra.During such important soloparts the camera should better stay close to the performing artist.Nevertheless when there's nothing interesting on TV, wich is mostly the case in our country, I put my tape of DP on and enjoy it over and over again."
3,STEVE MORSE HAS LOUSY VIBRATO,It is blasphemy! Steve Morse butchers the songs with his funky off pitch string bending. He has the most horrible vibrato. If no one else notices it they need their ears checked. Steve Morse is left handed but plays righty which is the problem with his vibrato that cannot be ignored. Yngwie Malmsteen would be better fitting in Deep Purple but he is too into himself and his controlling other players to have joined this legendary band.
1,this company sucks,they also sent me broken items and nothing fits my phone...DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM
4,Now Used by MMI,"Haven't had a chance to read through this book yet (just received it last-night).. but it's now the 'Official Motorcycle Repair' book endorsed by MMI. Don't know if that means this book is better than the $80 MMI book that's currently available, more than likely just more updated.Cheaper than the $14,000 price to attend MMI nowdays."
1,DO NOT GET THE PAPERBACK,"I, too, did not read the fine print and bought the paperback edition of this book, although both are titled ""(Workbook)"". I'm not sure where it states that the paperback was the workbook and the harcover was the manual, but the workbook is worthless without the manual. My advice? Buy the hardcover and hope that it includes the material rather than the questions."
2,"Too ""dancy"" , but good abs segment.",The aerobics segment was too complicated and dancy for most people. I suggest Arms and Abs of steel 2000 for a much better workout. Don't forget you'll need a step and some weights for this one!
4,Great for beginners,"I've tried several aerobics tapes that are too hard to pick up the moves or changes pace too rapidly. This is the first one that I have stayed committed to. The steps are repetitious and new moves are gradually introduced so it is easy to learn and follow. The 1/2 hour of aerobics always leaves me sweating. After doing the toning portion for several weeks, I was excited to see I was starting to develop a six pack in my abs and a tigher tushy. The abs workout is pretty challenging and although effective, I wish they would have provided more buns toning. But overall, I enjoy this tape and do it several times a week for a great workout."
4,Great Video,"This was an excellent beginners video. I must admit, at first, some of the aerobic steps were a little complicated, but after a few repititions, they are pretty easy to catch on to. After the aerobics comes the toning segment. That, too, can be challenging for beginners, but after doing it for a couple of weeks, it does get easier. I was really impressed with the way that Leisa cued the exercises (especially during the aerobics). Tracy and Michelle also did a good job. I give it 4 stars, mainly because I am a beginner/low-intermediate exerciser myself and I really have not tried other videos yet. I still really liked this video. I do recommend it to other beginners."
2,Buns & Abs of Steel 2000: Platinum Series - Beginners,"I definitely think the operative word in the title of this workout video is ""beginner"". I found the toning section for the glutes and abs to be extremely unchallenging. I barely broke out into a sweat during the first half of the video (which consisted of a 30 min. cardo workout). So if you consider yourself intermediate or advanced in physical fitness this is NOT the workout for you. However, if you're a first timer this video has easy to follow steps and good cues."
5,Fabulous tape!,My husband and I just started our workout program a few months ago after being couch potatoes for too long. We used a Greg Smithey beginner tape to start and have progressed to this tape. It gives us a great workout. They ladies are enthusiastic and the exercises are easy to follow. The combination of aerobics and toning really works wonders. I went from a size 10 to a size 6 in about 4 months! I wholeheartedly recommend this tape.
3,These 80's chicks are annoying but it does work!,"I tried this tape for the first time last night. I found the areobics section to be effective in getting my heart rate up. The steps seem pretty easy, but took me a few tries to get it right. When they start spinning around I got totally lost.But they cut away at crucial points - I wish they would just have shot it all staight on. The toning hurt but I could tell it was doing something! It was difficult to differentiate tilting the pelvis ""with the buns"" versus ""with the abs"" but that's probabally just me.The worst parts: the use of the word ""buns"", the 80's cheesy music, the three women and their obnoxious banter, their THONGS (gross, give me a break!), and the camera work. But I feel it today and I'm sure I'll learn to tone out the annoying bits after awhile."
5,Fun and to the point,"I enjoy working out to this video, it's fun and easy yet you still feel the burn!!"
3,garmin 76cx,"1st set Amazon sent was a disappointment. The unit intermittently went off by itself, during road use/usb connection to pc.Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement set pretty expediently and the 2nd unit has worked like a gem. This is my 3rd Garmin GPS.My loss is the freight I because delivery charges to Singapore, Asia!"
2,Customer Support Hung Up On Me,"After providing unhelpful recommendations, Garmin user support got frustrated with my questions and hung up on me. This was a first for me."
4,"ok, but...","An okay and good to handle device for navigating while sailing. Not much to critizize, then. Only the cource projection in the map screen is gone for some reason (the 76 Map had it.)"
2,Not as described,"The wrenches were not as described. They were chrome, not black anodized. They did not have measurement scales etched on them and they did not have the ATD brand on them."
2,Item not what's pictured,"As was said in other reviews, the wrenches were not as described. They did not have measurement scales etched on them and they did not have the ATD brand on them and there is a lot of slop in the lower jaw."
5,good book,its a great book for htose looking to get free from the bondage of domestic violence. Who would have ever thought that domestic violence is in friendships as well. I would have never ever thought that.
3,New research since 1982,"Great book for empowering women, but there are some problems due to its age. The most glaring is the claim that there is ""no persuasive evidence that children are happier or healthier in a two-parent than a one-parent home"" - there is now a wealth of empirical evidence to demonstrate that children are certainly better off emotionally with two parents, and even more tellingly, with their biological parents. This must be considered when making the decision whether to leave or stay."
5,Working Actors Tell It Like It Is,"This inspiring collection of interviews takes you on the journeys of several artists that share a passion and a common goal - to become a working professional in the entertainment industry. In response to Bonnie Gillespie's and Blake Robbin's thoughtfully posed questions, each working actor shares their heartfelt stories and life experiences that lead them on their road to success.From aspiring and veteran actors to the fans that show their undying support, all will be able to learn from and relate to the many challenges and similarities of each actor's chosen path. From how they got started to where they are now, the reality in these actor's lives is motivating, enlightening and helps us all to appreciate just how hard working they are.Thank you, Bonnie and Blake, for giving all of us a book that is filled with so much life and is a joy to read."
5,Straight Talk from Working Actors,"Another ""must have"" book for every aspiring actor from Bonnie Gillespie. This book is full of straight talk from working actors about the business we love. NY vs. LA, how to prepare for a role, what working actors wished someone had told them at the beginning of thier career and many more questions that we all ask ourselves once we know that acting is in our blood.Thank you Bonnie and Blake for creating this amazing book!!"
3,Not the Originals but What the Hey,"If you're like one reviewer who is having a party for the kids, this is okay. What do they know? If you are trying to add to your oldies collection, this is not for you. Clearly, most and perhaps all of the performers are not the originals, much less the original version. You decide."
3,Inexpensive backround music for Halloween.,"This is an inexpensive compilation of mostly Halloween novelty songs plus movie themes. The symphonic performances of movie music (Twilight Zone, Batman/Robin) seem out of place in this collection. All performances are good. As other reviewers note, the Halloween songs are cover versions. For older adults who remember (and love) the original performances of songs like ""Monster Mash"" and ""Love Potion No. 9,"" I recommend Rhino Record's ""Halloween Hits"" CD B0000032GJ instead."
3,Halloween Classics Covered...Oh Horror!,"A good collection of halloween classics but beware they are covers not original recordings. They still made the party fun, but a bit more searching and the original versions can be found."
3,Not as epic as I had expected.,"Metal heads beware, do not purchase this album expecting it to measure up to Mastodon.Props to Taste of Chaos for the amount of time and talent I'm sure it required to recreate this masterpiece. Unfortunately you can not recreate perfection. I apologize for the poor review, but you can not duplicate the genius in Brann's drumming, the intesity of Bill's riffs, the muscle behind Troy's bass, or the mind melting solos of Brents axe with a string quartet. My expectations for this album were just too high."
5,Beautiful,"I purchased this print to put into a frame I already own. I took it to a custom framer, who promised me that I was going to like how they framed it. I have to say, that when I saw it, I was completely overwhelmed and speechless. It is beautiful! I have it hanging in my diningroom, and needless to say it is the favorite of most of the men who visit my home. It is provocative, but not vulgar."
5,Calander review,"The product is a great idea not only to keep track of birthdays, but any other important date. You just flip the page for each new month and all the info. is there. It fits in a desk drawer perfectly. It has lessened the apologies I have had to make for sending late cards to family and friends!"
1,Buyer beware! More problems than it's worth,"I bought this player on sale, and be warned, I know now, why it was priced so low.I burned two CD with MP3s on them, and it has all kinds of problems reading and playing these CD-ROMs, as well as regular Music CDs.I put these CDs in another computer to read, and there wasn't a problem with any of them.It can only store 8 minutes of MP3 in memory, and takes a couple minutes to load the next 8 minutes of songs. It locks up several times, with it in the middle of songs, with a very loud buzz. I bought it for work, so I can listen to music, at my desk, but I've spent more time trying to get the CD to start spinning or pulling the batteries out, to reset the processor.This all happened in less than a week, and that is why I am here, warning all of you, and for me to find a replacement."
1,Disappointing compared to other MP3 CD Players,"I bought the M100 brand new. It was wellpackaged and sealed. When I first tried to play my MP3 CDs it would not read most of them. The only ones it read were those with all files in the root directory. It obviously was not reading directories. It also reads and plays normal CDs perfectly.I have a RioVolt MP3 CD Player and a Philips Expanium MP3 CD Player - both read and play ALL the CDs perfectly.Creative support as usual either do not respond to queries, or make excuses as to why they should not exchange the player.A poor product, poor service - beware of any Creative products."
1,BAd Product!,Thx they have DISCONTINUED TIS PRODUCT! But what abt the pple who are stuck on this low grade mp3 player? Mine died 2 weeks after playing my skipping mp3s. They gave me a new one. But it still skips like mad. It does not read 160kbps while they said the range is from 32 kbps to 256 kbps wow but hey its not and its a damn lie to get your money out. Sorry guys this one suks
1,Pure Crap,"I am only a teenage, and am to young to work. I spent the hundred for this player, and some extra for rush delivery. I have never made a worse purchase.Ever since i bought it it has had trouble playing certain cds. even ones i bought at music stores. Then my friend droped it about a foot onto a plastic chair, and since i have only been able to play one cd.DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER. If you want a good player buy a sony or an iRiver, but do not buy this one."
1,[bad],"I got this thing for it's ability to play mp3's, audio cd's, and the reasonable price. Well it plays audio cd's fine. It's the MP3 that won't work. Yeah, somehow I got 2 mp3's to play from a disk of 100 or so, but I have no clue how that miracle happened. Oh, and the hyped skip protection is nonexistant as is support for it on the creative support page. I have never bought a product that I felt so strongly against. I can't believe that this product made it out the doors of creative labs. It will be a miracle if I ever buy one of their products again. I only rated it a one because there was not a none. In essense this thing is pure [junk]."
2,Something wrong with this mp3-cd player...,"I burnt a cdr with a bunch of mp3 in it. It displays the song that it is playing but it won't play. Then I tried to burn a cdrw with a bunch of mp3's and it won't even read it. Also, I noticed that a line within the lcd that is missing. So I returned it for another one today and see how it goes.Assuming that the unit works, I am happy with it. The unit has a remote, nice earphones, very compact, sleek and price is reasonable."
2,disappointing,flimsy construction and skips between tracks that are blended together - on CD! not worth the money.
2,BIG PROBLEM,I bought this player 2 years ago. It was working fine until suddenly one day the screen displayed UPGRADE FILE REQUIRED....the disc starts spinning really fast and then everytime it would display the same thing. Creative support also sucks too...
3,Good idea wears out its welcome,"Definitley a great idea waiting to happen but a joke that wears a bit thin after a while. A killer concept not written to be read in one sitting and best viewed as a trial run for Phaic Tan, its far superior and much funnier sequel."
5,Molvania is not a place that I would like to visit,"I can't believe that a country like this can exist in modern society. The citizens are rude criminals with extremely bad hygene. All of the other eastern block countries should really pitch in and help these poor people out. The least we could do is send over little travel toothbrush/ tooth paste combo-packs!! I would rather vacation in Gary, Indiana than Lutenblag, Molvania any day!! ;-)"
2,funny... for about three pages,"Come to think of it, I wrote a ""book"" very similar to this when I was living in Norway: cynical humor about an unfamiliar place, recommendations for horrible traditional meals, advice for how to get away with not buying a ticket on the subway. I thought it was very funny then -- and I do now, but Molvania takes the joke too far. Pick it up at the library, flip through it, have a chuckle, and leave it for the next visitor."
3,An overhyped idea spoilt by poor authorship,"I picked up this book from an (almost) bargin bin because I remembered it being featured on the BBC some time ago. The prospect of a spoof traveller's guide always makes a great conversational piece, so I thought. This book turned out to be like an article on the Onion, with a single joke stretched over 180-odd pages. The humour ceased after a few pages, and I promptly fell asleep.The problem, I believe, is not with the concept, which I think is still very interesting, but that the writer(s). For the most part, the jokes are so poorly written, that the readers have already reached the punchline before the joke is finished. The pictures and the neutral reporting style, which is common in travel guides, do little to perpetuate the humour.While it is still a good thing to have on my coffee table, I doubt I will read past the second chapter. Correct that, I have already returned it."
1,Highly Offensive,"Being from E. Europe myself and being an avid traveller (travelled to 27 countries around the world by now), I find this book highly offensive. In my opinion, the authors are disrespectful of the people in the countries they have visited and inconsiderate of the live styles that these people in most cases have not chosen for themselves. Connecting with people and being able to understand them no matter how different they are, is the source of joy for a traveller like myself...the authors of this book have totally missed that..."
1,Just read the dedication...,"...to learn the level at which this textbook was written. As thorough as it is painful, this book should not be used for normal, college-level petrology classes. The sheer vocabulary used is enough to make any passionate geology student think twice about his/her choice of major. There was no reason to make a class pay this price for this textbook. Such a hefty price ought at least to spread some color images and diagrams throughout the book -- beyond the cover.All in all, professors beware: your students will not read this text for your class. They need one written in English."
1,"superficial, cliché.","Hard to believe this collection of short stories had any success at all. The stories are banal and not particularly well-written. Maybe when the book came out, it was a ""nouveauté"" to write in colloquial language (I read the book in its original French,) and to describe everyday-type of interactions, but frankly its literary value is no higher than that of any old blog and it holds one's interest even less than a typical old blog."
1,What the . . . . . .?!,"Yuck. Bad, bad, bad. Unfortunately ZERO STARS was not an option. I'd rather listen to ex-NFL star William ""The Refrigerator"" Perry suck food from between his teeth. You simply cannot imagine how horrible this is, but don't waste your cash to find out, because it may cause you to have bad dreams."
4,Much needed cd !,"I'm not sure what these other reviews are referring to, but they must be kids with nothing to do. This cd has a great group of songs on it. ""The Rhythm Of Your Heart"" is a song that gets tons of radio airplay here in Milwaukee and is loved by many people. I own this one along with his second cd ""Pretending"", and I can't wait for his new one in early 2007 !"
1,BWAAAAAAA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!,"Nevermind the one star rating. Not allowing for ZERO or NEGATIVE NUMBERS is a crime, when it comes to this hopeless cause.If you do not wear adult diapers, then I would not advise you to listen to this steaming heap of dung . . . because subjecting yourself to this CD will likely cause you to PEE YOUR PANTS with uncontrollable fits of hysterical laughter! Your bladder doesn't stand a CHANCE in the face of this laughably bad waste of time, money and space.Gadzooks, this is some terrible, terrible stuff. You have NO idea. Really.Of course, it's a tragic comedy . . . because I'm relatively certain this jackass actually takes himself seriously!BWAAAAAAAA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Love Story,I enjoyed the movie though it was a typical ex-con gets framed story. The acting is well done and it was nice to see Christopher Reeve walking and healthy. Takes place when times were hard and people did what they could to survive. Ends well.
3,Would not watch this movie again.,"This movie contained an uncomfortable sex scene, which would have been nice to know in the rating."
1,Surprize and then fastforward,Warning: there are two graphic sex scenes in the movie. I threw the DVD in the trash; I will not watch it again or condone the scenes it by selling it or giving it away to some one else.
2,MORNING GLORY,I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH SOME OF THE SCENES IN THIS MOVIE. THEY WERE UNNECESSARY TO FULFILLING THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN OR FAMILY TO SEE. I AM GOING TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN THE FUTURE ON BUYING ANY MOVIES AMAZON RECOMMENDS.
1,They've BUTCHERED my favorite book!,Talk about a HUGE disappointment. I was THRILLED to hear that they made a movie of my favorite book but the movie is a joke! How can a book and a movie be so totally different? Did the producers of this movie actually read the book first? Did LaVyrle Spencer have any say in it at all? I'd love to see someone else redo the movie based on the actual book this time!
4,Morning Glory starring Christopher Reeves,"This movie was announced as the ""following feature"" and as I was about to look around for something more interesting, the movie started and the soundtrack caught my immediate attention. It was haunting, so I thought I would just watch enough to finish the initial musical soundtrack, I got quite caught up in the plot, Chris Reeves was really a fantastic actor - (somewhere in time, and a movie where he played a priest). I would love to know the name of the songs played in this movie - wonderful movie!"
2,not like the book,I LOVED reading Spencer's Morning Glory. However this movie does not do it justice and the situation in the story is different from the one in the movie. I would not recommend it to others if they liked reading the book.
2,Morning glory DVD,"This was one of the first Lavyrle Spencer books I ever read and remains my favorite, that being said,the movie did NOT do it justice! Too much was left out !"
2,Morning Glory,"Not what I was expecting. Expecting a sweet chic flick, it really isn't. It is slow moving and didn't really draw me in. It tried to show how we can change when the circumstances require it, but, wasn't really believable."
2,based on Laveryl Spencer novel,"This was an independent film based on novel of same name by Laveryl Spencer-The film has some quality issues(fuzzy, jumpy frames, sound problems)Deborah Rafkin who starred in movie was instrumental in getting it filmed.She recently produced another L Spencer novel for CBS Family Blessings--she did not appear This film stayed true to the novel and the main storylines- althoughit was condensed to fit the timerestrictions of movies.If you LOVED the novel--you will like this movie--If you do not follow Laveryl Spencer--dont bother"
3,Linda,"I enjoyed the movie ""Morning Glory"". Although it did not follow the book exactly, it still made a nice love story for a long weekend afternoon."
3,Romance Drama,This was well acted. about a lady whos alone and this guy comes from prison and helps her on her farm. Its a slow going story but has some good drama in it. Light romance.
3,okay adaptation,"If you are a fan of the book, you'll find the movie dissatisfying.Unfortunately at roughly 90 minutes long, this TV movie is not given enough time for much character development. For eample, in the book, books goes into much detail the reason that Miss Beasley would offer Will Parker a job, but in the movie, it comes out of the blue - he visits the library once and she gives him the job a few months later.As for the so-called ""graphic"" sex scenes, I have no clue what the other reviews are talking about. If you buy this movie thinking you are going to see much of anything; think again.This movie was shown on CBS as I recall. There are plenty of more graphic sex scenes on daytime soaps and night time TV dramas these days than what is depicted here."
2,"Okay, but missing a lot","i absolutely LOVED this BOOK. The movie, on the other hand seemed to lack so much story from the book(it condenses about 2-5yrs into 10mo. not to mention a severe lack of war). I understand teh time constraints on the movie, but i believe that Will going to WWII was a very important part in his character developement, as well as changing his standing in Whitney(becoming a war hero and all).i thought both actors did an alright job, but not great, and i couldn't really feel the chemistry in them like i felt between the characters in the book.i also didnt like how the roles of Elly's children in bringing them together(inadvertantly, of course) were played down.OKAY movie, but i would recommend you buy the book, it's much more fulfilling."
3,Read the book first or instead,"The movie was good. However, it was based on one of my favorite books of all time, Morning Glory by Lavyrle Spencer and the plot was changed very considerably! I can't judge the movie on its own merits due to that fact."
1,Buy the book,"I was so disappointed, I don't even know why they called this Morning Glory when it bears no resemblence to Ms. Spencer's novel. No matter how intrigued you are to see what the film version looks like, don't waste your money."
2,Am I the only one who thinks this movie is pathetic?,"In short, the plot in this movie was non-existent. The only reason this dvd got 2 stars for me was the fact that Kirsten Dunst and Brittny Murphy were wonderful. I just wish their talents were put to better use."
1,I didn't like it.,"I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters. I was younger then, but I was very scared. The whole plot of the movie, (as I remember it) was about these girls in a beauty pagent. the part that scared me was that these girls were trying to kill each other, literally! I thought it was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I still think that. I would not reccomend this movie to people with younger children."
3,Drop Dead Funny,"Drop Dead Gorgeous may not be for everyone, but it is a highly slapsticky and silly movie. Kirsten Dunst stars as a trailer park girl with dreams of winning a beauty contest. Her rival is none other than the town princess, played by Denise Richards. The movie is filmed as a documentary type of film with some stylish camera work. The jokes and sight gags all work pretty well. Even the ones that aren't laugh out loud funny are still worth smiling over. Ellen Barkin is perfect as Dunst's trailer trash hairstylist mother. Perfect casting. Kirstie Alley as Richards' mom was a comedic gem. Her Minnesota accent and demeanor was top notch. Allisan Janney from ""The West Wing"" as another trailer trash character, is over the top hysterical. I laughed rather regularly. The movie is a really nice and delightful surprise. If you seek this one out and are in the right frame of mind, I think you will enjoy it, Give this one a try."
4,Amusing...,"This movie is pretty amusing when you want something light to watch. Coming from a Minnesotan, I thought all of their accents were really forced but, hey, they tried. Anyway, its good fun but not to be taken seriously. We're not really trailer trash here. Lona Williams is from my town (rosemount) so it was fun to see familiar scenery in this movie."
4,I couldn't stop laughing,This was one of the best movies I've seen all year! My friends and I had to keep rewinding some parts to experience it again! I highly recommend this movie if you need a pick me up after a hard week at work!
3,Drop Dead Insulting.....only if you want it to be.,"This movie was a funny dark comedy. It was very sarcastic, putting a mock twist on beauty pagents. You can get offended by this movie VERY EASILY if you are a small town southern person, or a serious christian, mentally retarded, or a beauty pagent queen yourself. I liked it. It's a good movie for people with good humor! I liked the charecters in it. All the actors had very very good accents. Denise Richards was a crackup when she did her talent! I never knew someone who could be in a movie like Wild Things could be that funny! Kristen Dunst was okay, but she's always that way. As for Alley, i swear, she HAS to learn when to say no, although she did play the part very well, i thought it was beneath her. It was a good movie good for a good laugh."
3,Cult family favorite,"This is a movie that we (my 3 grown daughters) and I like to watch from time to time for the one-liners. It makes fun of beauty pageants, the Midwest, small town politics, you name it, the gloves are off on this one. If you are looking for oscar-worthy performances, look somewhere else. If you are looking for low-brow laughs and an all around good time, look no further."
2,Spewing Beauty Queens,"Ive always been into black comedies about stupid American beauty queens getting homicidal, but this was a bit of a disappointment. Id really give it 2 1/2 stars, not just two, but you know how it is.It certainly had some good laughs, and heaps of parts where you just cringe and go ""Oh my God, how sick."" Denise Richards was hilariously sickening, dancing with a stuffed Jesus, and I found it funny when all the Beauty Queens were throwing up (I dunno! It just kinda puts a quirky spin on the whole idea of beauty pageants!)So it was all right, but I couldve done better (ha ha!)"
4,Drop Dead Funny (and Gorgeous Denise too),"Nicely played satirical look at beauty pageants, with some great moments. Kirsten Dunst is superb as the main character, and Denise Richards looks stunningly gorgeous as ever (God did make perfection, and her name is Denise), but the funniest actor is the one playing a sort of perverted judge who seems far too interested in the girls than is needed for his post...hilarious. He really steals the show, but Kirstie Alley gets out of made-for-TV hell in a great part for her. Would have been better with some extras on the DVD, but just enjoy the movie. I just wish these would make money instead of movies like Godzilla. Ah well, we can dream..."
4,tell the movie man what your talent do.........,"this movie is one of my guilty pleasures. i can always pop it in the dvd player when i need a laugh. i particularly am amused by Denise Richard's priceless facial expressions, and Ellen Barkin's role is hilarious. not for those who actually take the concept of beauty pageants seriously. thanks Michael Patrick Jann for this comedic treat."
5,Hilarious satire movie,"This was a funny satire type movie that kept me laughing and entertained throughout. It stars Kirsten Dunst as Amber, a young hopeful girl who is entering a beauty pageant. The movie also stars Kirstie Alley, Allison Janney, Denise Richards and Ellen Barkin. Alley plays Gladys, mother of Becky (who is also entering the pageant). The movie is funny from start to finish, very over the top in terms of humor, but it's hilarious. Almost every scene has something funny, or very subtle that you need to pay attention to in order to catch on. It's a fun silly movie that I've enjoyed watching again and again."
3,"Great Movie, ha!!","This movie wasn't bad, but the ending could have been better! Why do the good guys always have to win? Why couldn't they let the bad guy win for once, especially the way they did it! Parts of this were really funny, other parts, were just [crud] and, I guess it was a little offensive to the people with disabilities! This movie went kinda overboard with that, but it wasn't too bad!! Good acting in it, okay plot and it does have some character to it, but please, don't make another dumb ending like this!! Swordfish was cool, the way Travolta explained everything at the beginning. Good guys don't always have to win, but it's better when they do! But this movie just took it way too far!"
5,Hands Down the best comedy ever made!,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is just one of those movies that everybody would love, and only a few actually see it despite nobody ever hearing about it. Playing on so many levels of comedy the movie can be enjoyed by preteens for physical comedy, young adults for the obvious humor and adults of all ages for the subtle remarks made by this fabulous cast. I can tell you that the movie is abrasive and has a certain shock value that some people may find uncomfortable at first. My grandfather is a real prude and doesn't usually like any dark or witty humor but I have never seen him laugh like he did when he saw this movie. My father loves it, my little brother loves it, my mother adores it and I belong to a ""cult"" with a couple of friends who love this movie too. I have given this a five rating despite the sloppy ending but the first, middle and last half of the ending make up for the floundering wrap up by leaps and bounds."
1,Drop Dead drop dead gorgeus,"I always thought this movie was stupid. I even watched it again to see if my opinion would change since some of my friends liked it. It still seemed to move slow, with a jerky plot and unsympathetic characters. The humor was flat, this movie tried to be clever and when it tried to take itself seriously it just messed itself up even worse. If this movie was a person it would need counseling. And yes, it was very politically uncorrect, not that that matters, but they treated anorexia and murder like they were jokes. If it had been a little bit more terrible I would have laughed my head off, but then the film would try to take itself seriously and the plot would belly flop again. So it was just boring. I would like to give it zero stars. I would have given it two if Kirsten Dunst's annoying character had gotten killed at the end, because at least that would have been poetic justice after sitting through this movie."
1,Only if you've been there...,This is a movie that was hysterical to my girlfriend who has participated in such things. To me though this had few funny moments and lots of waiting for the next laugh. Wouldn't recommend it unless you need sleep!
5,Great Satire!,"OK If you don't get the humor of say Mad Magazine , the Simpsons or SNL, you probably won't appreciate this film. But if you do, and you can laugh at some ""Traditional American Values"" then you will find this funny. Now, just because they make fun of folks in the midwest and of people who live in trailer parks, and people who are religious does not suddenly make this not funny. Heck, they make fun of nearly every person they meet in the film. Hopefully you DO see a piece of yourself someplace in there and you can laugh at it!Simply, its one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It was terribly marketed so few people got to see it. There are plenty of copies on Amazon for less than you'd pay for a bucket of popcorn. So if you like satire, and laughing, and enjoy a killer female cast, then I say get the film, turn off your sensibilities, and enjoy yourself!"
5,"I know what some of your big-city, no-bra-wearin', hairy-legged women's libbers might say.","If you laughed at the title of my review check out this movie. It is one of my favorite quotes from the movie.This however is not a movie for everyone. This is a dark, politically incorrect comedy. There are some obvious laughs like a girl singing, ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" and dancing with a life size Jesus on the cross.It has a great cast but the best is Allison Janney as Loretta, Annette and Amber Atkins neighbor. However Kirstie Alley as the slightly insane stage mother is just great.Like I said not for everyone but if you do like this movie you will want to watch it over and over again."
4,Right Over the Top!,"This very funny mockumentary has something to offend everyone -- the hallmark of the best Black Humor. It's a perfect film to watch after a long, lousy day at school or the office. Great fun."
5,Drop Dead Gorgeous,"This is a truly fabulous movie. Set in small town America it is a deliciously wicked black comedy , proving beauty queens are more scheming than they look! Ellen Barkin is on top form as the beer-swilling mother and Kirsten Dunst puts in a good turn as Amber. A special mention also goes out to the badly refridgerated seafood scene, do not watch when eating!"
3,What more can I say?,"Drop Dead Gorgeous is a very funny (sometimes hilarious) poke at middle America and the world of beauty pageants. All of the acting is very good, and the best jokes are the characters themselves. Let's see, you have the Japanese couple so proud of their white daughter; Sam McMurray as the smarmy, bigoted owner of a furniture store; Ellen Barkin with the beer can fried to her hand; and Denise Richards dancing with - well, I don't want to spoil that one for you. And there's more! It's hilarious. I thought the ending dragged on a bit too long (and wasn't so funny as the rest of the film) but despite that, I enjoyed the story and actors a great deal. This is a goofy movie, but it's smart! And so there's no guilt in watching (and liking) it."
4,Very funny comedy with smashing cast,"This is the story of a beauty pagent, documentary style. It's very darkly, funny. The characters in this movie are so great, especially Hank. Hank is a character you feel sorry for, but you just have to laugh. This movie stars Ellen Barkin, Nora Dunn, Kirstie Alley, Kirsten Dunst, and a whole lot more. I'd see it, it's pretty funny."
4,"Perhaps not a revolution, but definitely fun.","If you mixed 'Fargo' with 'Waiting for Guffman', you might get something a little like 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'. The humor's none too subtle (and some of the characters really get savaged) but it's hard to dislike a film that has such a wacky sense of fun.Central performances are strong and stable, with Denise Richards in particular providing a clever main hate figure. Occasionally the humor takes a dive towards the cheap, but overall it's heartwarming and just surreal enough. Good stuff."
1,Make sure when you order this it is for REGION #1 in the U.S.,"Couldn't watch it - more like ""dead weight"" due to the U.K. offering being a REGION 2 release.Would not play here in California.Live & Learn"
1,you may like it if you're liberal,"you may like it if you're liberal or you for some other reason think midwesterners or christians are idiotshowever, I myself didn't laugh, not even once. for me, the movie was a complete waste of time"
1,Dumb!,"This movie is truly crap. I sat through it once when it first came out, then again when my sister told me to watch it. I'm from minnesota, actually near Pine City. This is a scandinavian area and they portrayed miss Pine City as an asian girl. That's the only part of the movie I laughed at, not with. Do your research a litt.e Minnesota is not a trailer park trash state, and it seemed to me the people acted more like people of some parts of west virginia....I have a sense of humor, but wow. This is a dumb movie."
4,Great Fun.,"I was really impressed with this movie. It is fun-loving and very funny. Drop Dead Gorgeous has a great idea and takes an almighty swipe at Beauty Pageants. If only there were more of Denise Richards I would of given it 5 stars...Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) is a lovely high-school student who has suddenly decided to take place in the Mount Rose Teen Beauty Pageant. She is competing against the bitchy Denise Richards and many suprises are in stall for them all.....Fun, enjoyable and hilarious - Drop Dead Gorgeous is a great movie to see."
4,Lighten up critics!,"Not every movie is made to delve into the depths of our souls; this movie was simply hilarious! You have to take movies like DDG at face value; for its entertainment value. The movie is well-acted and I thought Kirstie Alley was great with her little ""accent"". The movie had some bizarre twists and turns which were unpredictable which made it very enjoyable. During the whole movie, my daughter and I would laugh and say, ""Oh Gawd, this is awful"" and still laugh and laugh. Even after watching it 3 times, we still laughed and laughed. If you need a dark, philosophical movie, go watch something else. If you've had a hard day and need to escape into fantasy and need some good belly laughs, then rent DDG. Oh, and critics, must you give away the whole movie when you guys rate these movies? For those who haven't seen it yet, it really is a bummer to give away the plot."
3,Black-humored parody on US society!,"This is fun! Dark fun! Parodistic fun!A movie with such a thin story and such mediocre acting that the producers made it as a documentary. And that was indeed a wise choice, 'cause it makes it very funny!The best parody on the U.S. of A. since The Simpsons!"
1,What a waste,"I am so thankful that I rented this movie instead of buying it. This movie was tasteless, the plot was pointless, to sum it up it was definately a waste of time and money. Hollywood could have done better."
1,Absolute trash!,"I feel sorry for all of the actresses in this movie. it was a complete waste. it really WAS terrible-the script was junkie and flaky, the acting was horribly unbelievable and the plot couldn't even be more ironic. Who wants to see a beer can burnt to a woman's hand? ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Do your brain a big favor by not watching this movie, which should have been called ""Drop Dead Garbage"". A major disappointment and waste of time."
1,STUPID,This is one stupid movie. It made absouletly no sense. I HATED IT. I wasted my money on this piece of junk.
1,JUNK,Who had the idea to make this junk? Have they paid a person to write something like this? You better keep your money and spend it for something good. If I could give zero stars I would.
3,This is certainly something.,"At first look, this movie was a huge mess to me. With each subsequent viewing, I learned to just loosen up a little bit and laugh a little bit. This movie is extremely silly, and done in a style that takes some getting used to. It certainly is unique. Kirsten Dunst is good of course, and the movie is well acted. If you are in the mood for something light, but different, give 'Drop Dead Gorgeous' a try. Laugh a little bit."
5,Best movie of the 1999 summer!,This was one of the funniest movies of the year. In a summer of Dick and a bad Austin Powers sequel this comedy shined. A must have for my collection.
1,Cracked CD.,I went to open this sealed CD to find that the disc itself was cracked right down the middle. I was rather bummed!!
4,A great satire,"This movie is really, really funny. From the description of the movie, I didn't think I'd like it because it sounded like a trite storyline. However, the off-the-wall handling of the subject matter and the comedic ironies make this movie worth watching - again! The DVD version doesn't have any outtakes or deleted scenes, though, just the trailer."
2,Love the actresses but unfortunately not the movie.,There were some funny moments but considering the talent involved it was a letdown. If you want real fall down funny watch Waiting for Guffman.
5,Rockin,Great great live show that makes you really appreciate the energy that must've been in the house at the time.
5,probably the best introduction to neoliberalism,"This book is very good, because it combines an introductory approach to the subject with Harvey's expertise. He does a great job of writing for nonexperts, avoiding jargon, focusing on important details, and constructing a memorable historical narrative. In addition, he provides the theoretical analysis and explicit political stance that one would expect from Harvey. The fact that he does both makes this book superior to Steger and Roy's Neoliberalism: A Very Short Introduction as well as Giroux's The Terror of Neoliberalism."
4,Helpful for my BA thesis research,"I bought this book, because my BA thesis adviser recommended it to help me gain a better understanding of what neoliberalism is and how it came about. For that purpose I would really recommend it. Even if you don't agree with Harvey's political views (I do, which makes the book an enjoyable read for me) you can still pick up some useful background knowledge on the rise of neoliberalism."
1,No Flexibility within single minded extreme views,"The most compelling argument I can say about Harvey's Neoliberalism is this; Harvey looks at every extreme view point and over emphasis it. At no point during his argument does he make a note to how the communist views that he expresses do not grow economies. He shows no regard to the truth of Adam Smith's points made so many years prior. Truthfully there has never been a successful communist nation that has not become authoritarian in some way. Even China has adopted the means of success called ""CAPITALISM"". Milton Friedman makes a wonderful counter argument to Harvey that is rooted in truth un like Harvey. Don't waste your time, if you want to get the gist of this book with out reading it just watch the bias news networks."
2,Pray that it gets remastered,"I could understand the audio from the live footage being shoddy (though the review from the person who owned the laserdisc version makes me question this) -- but the audio from easily remastered sources (the videos, the filmed bits) is equally atrocious. It looks like the company just used the old VHS master to make this DVD and didn't do an ounce of remastering, reprocessing, or restoration -- much like companies in the mid-'80s rushed out catalog CDs made from album masters.Avoid wasting your money on this, and instead spend your time pestering Image Entertainment to do this DVD *right.*"
3,Need this to complete your Annie Repertoire,"Ok, so maybe some of these reviewers aren't ""real"" Annie Fans, you know, the kind that know Annie and Dave were in a band Before they were Eurythmics... That being said, there are two BIG reasons to get this DVD: Satellite of Love & Tous Les Garcons ET Les Filles. Two songs thay you CANNOT get anywhere on ANY of their domestically released albums - and I think you'd be hard pressed to find them on an Import - as far as I know they don't exist anywhere else. Hard Core fans will want and need this addition to their DVD collection."
3,product quality,My old VHS tape was better quality. it was obviously not a good transfer to a new medium. They could have massaged the video and sound to produce something of a higher quality.
3,Historical Artefact,"I am not rocked surely.""Sweet Dreams"" itself is OK and a rest, a mix of animation, live concert and some doco, impresses me a little.Good on a shelf as a historical artefact."
4,Love is A Stranger,"I thought this was pretty good. The quality was great and the live stuff was good but nothing compared to the videos. Who's That Girl, Love Is A Stranger, and Sweet Dreams having those 3 was worth the dvd. Get this put it in and when it's done get ""peacetour"" and you'll see just how much the Eurythmics have changed and matured."
3,Can't expect more from such an old tape - get it anyway,"The criticisms about the sound quality are entirely true; this DVD is sub par in every respect, no better than an old video tape. But then again, does anyone expect it to be more? The chances that anyone will ever remaster this early eighties concert are slim to none. So take this DVD for what it is - a convenient replacement for your Betamax tape."
1,Very Disappointing,"OK, first let me start off by saying that I had already owned this Eurythmics concert on laserdisc. Since I was replacing my lasers with DVD's I bought this one over again. I am now sorry that I did 'cause it was a total waste of money. The sound quality is the most awful I've ever heard on a DVD. I should have listened to some of the reviews warning me of this. My laserdisc copy is much, much better. To make matters even worse there is nothing extra on this DVD (not even an interesting menu). All it contains are the song titles on the opening screen. Releasing sound quality like this should be a crime. However if you would still like to purchase this I will sell you mine for a cheaper price."
3,Does the job for now,"Not a HP-branded item, so I have no idea if it lasts as long as the original. Lord, I hope not! - the original only lasted 18 months. Every HP power brick I've ever had burns out within two years, and no other brand of imaging hardware I've ever used has this problem. Probably that's due to the fact that Lexmark, Toshiba and other brands I've used puts the stepdown power transformer on the printer's PCB internally, not externally on the power cord. Heat kills electronics, but I don't know what's more annoying - replacing a $60 Lexmark printer including the toner (not a bad deal, actually) or tracking down a reasonably-priced replacement power cord every other year for an HP printer. Price an OEM one yourself, you'll see what I mean.Anyhow, a fair deal so far. Reasonably priced, quick shipping."
5,"Great slicker brush for dogs, cats & horses!","I have been using this slicker brush for quite a few years now; especially on my horses during shedding season, but also on my dogs & cats. They work great to remove dead hair (on short to medium haired animals),removes mud and stickers as well. The horses love being groomed with this brush. It is easily cleaned by knocking it against my boot. It is my daily go-to brush. Mine seem to last about four years."
3,Works like it describes...,"I got this for my cat who's about 11 - 12 lbs.It works like the description says. But, my cat doesn't seem to like it though.The reason that I put a 3 star for this is because it actually makes a big mess when you use the rake. And if you use the slicker brush, its hard to get all the fur out. It works, but its kind of a pain in the butt. I have carpet in EVERY room except the kitchen and bath; and sadly, my kitchen & bath isn't a suitable environment to use this in. Nowhere to sit so I can hold on to my cat (cause he'll runaway if I don't have him sit on my lap while using this).Also, I'm not sure if this is intended for cat use or dog use; but, this is too big for my cat. I think this is more suitable for a dog instead; unless you have a HUGE cat :PI use this on my bed in my room, and its just a big pain in the butt to clean up afterwards. But I guess that's expected...But, it works like it says...That's what's important right?"
5,Excellent book,"Yes, this is an excellent book on Phyllis Krystal's direct experience with Sai Baba. For a more recent and an indirect experience with Baba, readers may refer to my bookHow Sai Baba Attracts Without Direct Contact: Diary of a 21st Century Sai Devotee."
1,"sai baba fraud, sexual abuser","Sai Baba has been 100% proven to be a complete fraud! 100% no question, how can any devotees still be so naive & gullible to believe in him??? They are like Scientologists no matter what the evidence & proof against the founder L. Ron Hubbard - they won't accept it! They even claim anyone saying anything against Sai Baba is lying (really? thousands of liars). WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!! &#65279; Sai Baba is a fraud - look up videos of him faking miracles on camera for a start, then look at the lies he told."
4,Good but rugged,"Much in the realm of the Celestine Prophecy if you can get past awkward writing; it is a great story for seekers. Now, will someone write a book that is a compelling story AND brilliantly written in this genre ?"
4,Worth reading!,"Another great book by a great mind. Although, this volume is not his masterpiece work, it is definitely worth reading. Fromm taps into the core issues of religion, and addresses the schizm that exists within the bureaucracy of organized religion. One side is pulling toward a patriarchal, authoritarian, fear and guilt orientation, while the other is geared toward self-realization, as well as the promotion of human ideals. He does not agree with Freud on many issues, and he warns about the limits of psychoanalysis as a tool in the search for man's higher spiritual self. Although psychoanalysis is not trendy any longer, it remains the core and the glue that holds the subjective field of psychology together."
3,Not his best....,"Fromm rigidly adheres to his version of the humanist position here by claiming that the mystics of all faiths have been imbued with the glow of man's powers--powers of heart, mind, spirit--rather than God's, God being a symbol of those same powers, awaiting unfoldment.From a theistic/mystical perspective, however, this is a side-effect, and if taken for the Source of the experience brings on a tremendous inflation of the ego. No mystic really thinks, as Fromm does, that man is the measure of all things. Fromm is best when he sticks to human psychology--THE SANE SOCIETY, ESCAPE FROM FREEDOM, THE ART OF LOVING are worth buying."
3,Naive in the typology of religion,"I had trouble rating this. The biggest failing is that Fromm really has only a layman's grasp of what religion is and consequently makes dumb statements like ""secular religion"". He confuses Weltanschauung with religion and they are not necessarily the same thing. He also makes some fairly trite comparisons with religion and psychoanalysis. The bulk of the book is a commercial for his particular brand of humanistic Neofreudianism viz. classical Freudianism. It is not his best book."
3,So-so,I bought this because it said in great shape. But it has that thick white line of fuzz at the bottom half way through the movie. It might be only the tracking but I couldn't seem to get it to play right.
2,Please don't ever make me watch this thing again!!,"This movie was not very true to the book. The man in the yellow suit didn't wear a yellow suit, Winnie had a turtle, not a frog. . etc. It was pretty well made, but if you are a great fan of the book you might not like it. The new version made in 2002 is a little more accurate to the book, so you might try that as an alternate to this. The story of this movie is pretty good though, because the book was a very good book. People who remember this movie from their childhood might like this, though. I didn't really like it because it strayed too far from the book, but others might."
3,'Tuck Everlasting' (1981),"I remember bits and pieces of this movie on 'Showtime' or 'HBO', so long ago. It's about this 15 year old girl in old 'Victorian Era'( horse and carage era),she meets this family deep in the woods,and they tell her of there everlasting life by drinking from a magic spring. They invite her to join them with everlasting life by drinking some of the water,but she can't decide,so they leave her some water and say they'll be back in 50 or 100 years. 100 years later they return to a town full of cars and sidewalks trying to locate her,they find her,they find her grave. On the grave 'dear wife and mother',later they discover she gave the water to the frog that she carried in her pocket. For me very spooky and haunting back then. Tried to remember the title of this movie,but so long ago until the remake,too late,oh well."
4,Tuck Everlasting,I remember seeing this show years ago.I loved the movie than and I loved the new release of the movie.I took 5 of my children to watch the new release and they loved it!They never seen the movie in 1981.This is a great movie and it leaves you with all kinds of feelings.Part of you wanted her to drink the water and live forever with Jessie
4,I've got it at last,It is hard to believe I paid this much for a VHS tape but I'm glad I did. I find this version much better than the new one. It seems to be a simpler story with out the over-acting. They never show it on TV so I had to get it. One of the things I really like about it is the haunting music and the ending on this one.
2,Too Basic,This book is really for a complete beginner. Some of the questions are so basic and common sense I couldn't believe anyone would even ask! If you are an experienced runner this book is not for you.
4,Wish it was a bit brighter!,"I am using this inside my glass door cabinet above my microwave. It is very nice to look at when the kitch lights are off at nite or during the day. I love that this outlet light has an off/on switch. Although, I will seldom sue it. I highly recommend!"
2,Call Me A Party Pooper!,"The product itself is sleek and good looking enough, durable and real leather.The two stars are for one reason. The stitching on the inside may scratch the faceof your iPod. So if you dont mind this, then go ahead and give it a try. I myself do notwant this and it kind of defeats the purpose of having a cover. I am returning it ASAP!Do yourself a favor and open the box before you leave the store. Run your fingers alongthe inside and check for this with any leather iPod case."
3,Hard to read,"Tells time accurately if you can read it. Face is very small and has a prism effect whenever it's in the light (most of the time), making it pretty hard to read."
3,Reflective dial,"The style is nice. Very basic and neutral. My only issue was that the dial is so reflective I found it a little difficult sometimes to read the time,"
4,Great Practice Tool!,"Is this a replacement for a real conga? Nope. Not even close.But sometimes you want to practice and not lug around a big ol' drum, and this little guy fits the bill nicely.The 11 3/4"" size makes it large enough to practice most techniques, including heel/toe and slaps. You can practice bass technique as well, but it won't actually sound like a real bass hit at all."
3,"fun album, not spectacular","So Im a bigtime blur fan, but I've always avoided Graham Coxon's solo work. However, after reading some of the reviews of this album that talked about how it was sorta like Parklife-era blur, I was interested. After hearing ""Freaking Out"" on the radio, I was sold.Well, the album is okay, nothing too special. Some of the bluesy stuff is a tad cringe-inducing. It has its moments, but there is nothing as sublimely amazing as Coxon's guitar work with blur. The whole exercise just a rings a bit hollow for me. It doesn't seem like Mr. Coxon is really giving his all."
1,Purchased for my daughter in law for her dad,I really can't rate this as it was not purchased for me. I bought it for my daughter in law for her father. I personally don't like the series.
5,Seinfeld ~ Season 6,Love it - miss it. Have bought all the seasons to have around when there's nothing as good on television which is often!!
3,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in Season Six. I thought it was a marked step down in quality from Season Five, which featured one classic episode after one another.In this season, the writing seems a bit forced. Whereas Season Five managed to walk the fine line between absurdity and implausibility, this season just goes whole hog for the implausible, and with less-than-hilarious results.That said, a few individual episodes still glimmer -- particularly ""The Chinese Woman"" and ""The Beard."" Otherwise, a lackluster season."
1,Technical problems and mediocre support,"I bought the predecessor to this product. As a relatively handy technical person, I found the installation and setup of this device quite cumbersome and the support information lacking.Installation: This requires a savvy technical person probably 2 hours to get installed and start using. There are a lot of finicky recognition problems with XP. Mine cycles through being recognized / not recognized, all the while beeping every minute when it changes status; all this happens too fast to get it up and running. It also starts spinning of its own accord even when not being used, which is a distracting sort of scratching noise (disconcerting to hear one's media sound like this).Included software: The recording software is difficult to figure out, even when following the user help and documentation.Online support: Their support website for this produce is quite bare compared to much of the rich support that is often offered by other companies."
1,good at making CD costers,"I bought this for my thinkpad X31 to be used as CDRW/DVD player, not so much for music listening. I got iriver cd MP3/WMA player for that. I do not think there are too many MP3/WMA player that could beat iriver's feature. anyways, going back to Sony... it seems to be working fine as CD/DVD reader but I haven't yet had success with recording/writing to CD yet (except for making 4 CD costers for my desk). I have had 5 different kind of CDRW that I have used and never had problem until this one (never read manual to operate). I used there provided software and windows explorer but neither one seem to complete the writing successfully. I am following the manual (I actually read the maual) correctly. I'll try couple more time with different setting and if still doesn't work than I'll have to return them."
1,Not ready to rock.,"Nice Idea; Poor Execution; Not Ready. Sub-1.0 release.1 example:Plays MP3-DVDs containing upwards of 1200 songs (files). But device has only a single-line lcd readout & NO FILE BROWSE MODE.What does this mean? Say you want to listen to song #1172...1. obtain carpal tunnel wrist brace.2. hit up/forward on remote's jog-diall <<<1171>>> TIMES!(of course if you are a gambling man you could always just put it on random and take side-bets with your friends.)3. enjoy?No file browse mode, no plus 10 or plus 100 buttons, no easily accessible battery (sure, feel free to care around the external harness dock thing and EIGHT AA's (that's 8).Not ready for primetime.Wanna buy mine? I am selling it cheap and it's as LEMONy-fresh."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk","I've had an Eigen for about two months now. Last week at the gym, the Eigen fell about 4 feet onto a rubberized floor. Shouldn't be a problem, right?Wrong. It played one more song, then displayed a message, ""Upgrader"" on its LCD. After doing some poking around on Rio message boards, I learn that this is very common when the Eigen or Nitrus is jostled. Some fixes include upgrading the firmware, reattaching the hard drive's ribbon to the main board, or just whacking the unit against the table a few times. Unfortunately, like most people, none of these worked for me.The Eigen is a piece of junk. I wouldn't buy it again if a comparable unit were within $100. It just isn't worth the risk."
3,"nice, but not good enough","I just got it yesterday, it works good, but for the control manual, not as good as I wished. i perfer iriver here. the program buttom is so small and flat, can hardly feel it. i have to use my nail tip to push it. the rotation control has no real big functions, i can not even choose the song in the same album while it is runing. i have to touch the program buttom and start over to select songs in different album. all in all, the sound it good enough for a mp3 player, size is cute. but the control manual is so so. really so so."
1,Piece of...,"Horrible, just like other owners, the Eigen fell about 6 inches on the ground. Would not load, became extremely hot and when attempted to have serviced by RIO, they said we will fix it for $100. Hmm..let me think have you send me a refurbished Rio Eigen or buy an Apple Shuffle? Thanks but Ill pass!"
1,WWWWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH,"When i got this thing i thought is was the player from heaven. less then a week later...it gave me hell. It made a weird bepping sound, would'nt play music with out turning off, and it would not connect to the usb port. in all i just got a replacement and if it dosnt work im gettin the iGP-100. Burm yours."
2,"The subject is fascinating, but the prose is deadly","Don't believe it when they say readable. It is not actually UN-readable, but it is hard to believe any ""informed general readers"" actually make it all the way through. Which is a shame, since this is a very important subject.Try ""The Return of Depression Economics"" by Krugman. It covers most of the same ground, and is extremely informative, but does it in a very readable fashion."
5,One Of The Best By One Of The Best,"If you're at all interested in Warne Marsh, here's the deal - Warne Marsh was one of the rare musicians hyped as a ""genius"" who actually was one. This is one of his best records, ever. If you're a fan, you'll either already have it or should plan on getting it. If you're not a fan, why bother? And if you haven't made up your mind, this is as good an album as any to investigate."
5,One of the greatest jazz albums ever,"This is one of Warne Marsh's very best albums, and to me, one of the greatest jazz albums ever. This reissue is one of the musical highlights of recent years. Marsh's soloing on this album is consistently inspired, and the rest of the group is supportive and engaging. The producer is to be highly praised for bringing this wonderful music to us, especially with the intriguing selections which were previously unreleased. An essential jazz album."
5,Stiffelio review,"I invited friends over to watch Stiffelio. It was a grand experience. The singing voices were wonderful and the staging was great. There wasn't a dry eye in the room when the opera ended. Very, Very moving and I would recommend this production to any opera lover."
5,Love it,absolutely love this ipod case. great all around protection from and the fact that I can clip it on my waist or in my pockets is an added bonus. lookin into getting a black one!
4,GETTING RESPECT,"This story is basically about getting respect. This new cat, Darrell Mercer, messed Tyray Hobbs, life up. Tyray, now he tries to scare Darrell to get his life back on track. His so called friend Rodney betrayed Tyray but fears him after he gets the gun. During Tyray's lifetime he loses every thing he had. Then he bought a gun from a dude named Bones."
2,Bad,This book want very good it kind of sucked it was just really lame there's nothing more I got away about this book.
4,Not all RealSteel,"Bought 2 of GROHE Alira Faucets for my customers just remodeled home. Received the faucets in two days, that was great. I opened the boxes and looked over the product and found to my amazement the faucets were not all ""Made from RealSteel - a professional grade, 18/10 stainless steel with inherent antibacterial properties"" as stated in the product info. The pull out sprayer was all plastic with stainless plating that didn't even match the real stainless exactly. I was lucky that my customer had picked this faucet or I would of had do some explaining to them why it wasn't all stainless steel like I described. I probably would have had to return it and caused the kitchen not to be completed on time."
5,Terrific read!,"My father is one of the featured aviators in this book. The author interviewed my father extensively, and the depiction he provided in his book matches exactly with the stories my father told me.I would expect that family of other featured men and women would have similar remarks to make.The author is a talented writer, having many aviation books to his credit, as well as some fine fiction, so if the reader is looking for both an historically correct rendering of some of the finer moments in aviation, and a fine read, this book is for them."
2,Headset doesn't work,"The charger is the only good thing in the set. The case is a little too small for the phone to fit well, and the headset is not compatible with the phone. LG Chocolates don't use a traditional jack output, the headset plugs in the same place as the charger."
1,It's more like Polka music...,"I bought this CD thinking that it would sound more like french accordion music played at Paris cafes. Unfortunately, it was more like Polka music played for folk dancing....very disappointed."
5,Paris CD,Great fun and festive music. Transcends time. You'll feel like you're stolling through Paris when you listen to this cd.
4,Very good sound,"I needed a sample of accordion sound for my collection. This is a very good sample, with wonderful sound & a few outsatanding selections."
1,Not worth it.,"I bought this 1 month ago and have not put it in my car even right now, smells disgusting, not worth it."
2,This book has problems.,"Wedge's Gamble is quite possibly the worst in the series. It combines all of the failings of the other books with a boring and unbelievable story. I didn't enjoy Tycho Celchu's problems dealing with the squadron's newest droid (who in many ways is a clone of C-3P0). I also felt that the lack of realism was mostly due to the complete stupidity of the Imperials and the grossly imbalanced casualties that are handed out during battle. Has anyone else played TIE Fighter, or X-Wing Alliance? There is more to blowing up capital ships than flying in and lobbing proton torpedoes at maximum range. The dogfights seemed slow and detracted from the very real threats to the Republic by becoming so character driven. Corran (as usual) was rather annoying, particularly when he drew attention away from the main characters, and the major plot. This is one of the weaker ones of the series, buy The Courtship of Princess Leia, or The Bacta War instead."
5,Captivating!,"Set directly after X-wing:Rogue Squadron. Wedge's Gamble, as the title reads, is refers to the New Republic's attempt to use Rogue Squadron to capture Coruscant from the Empire. Ysanne Isard (new leader of the Empire) is making a virus to inflict on Coruscant. (beware graphic details of the how the virus affects citizens of Coruscant, its not for the weak of stomach)"
4,Star Wars,"This is a good series of books, even though Luke, Leia, and Han are not usually a big part of the story. The books are interesting. The books are centered around Wedge and his x-wing pilots. These books are often funny. They also offer excitement in the form of x-wing battles."
4,Better...,"Definitely an improvement over the first, this second book is fast paced without compromising the characters, full to the brim with action, and heartfelt as well, focusing on a wider spectrum of characters, from Wedge to Corran to the young Gavin Darklighter. The plot is a little simplistic, and the battle scenes a bit forced, but oddly enough it didn't seem to matter since this was mainly a book for character development. For those of you who've been following the ""mainstream"" expanded universe novels this one (and the entire series) should be particularly interesting, not only showing what was happening in the galaxy during this neglected three or four year period, but also giving interesting insights into how the rest of the galaxy, the ""normal"" people, see Luke, Han, Leia and the rest. This book also helped me to gain interest in Corran Horn, I character I previousely despised. Anyway, I won't spoil the plot for you, but if you like Star Wars, and action, than this series is for you."
4,And so it heats up,"I have heard it said that you have to start something off with a bang, then you have to take it up a notch. This is also true if you are writting a book.X-Wing #1 was fine although a bit slow it had to be to introduce us to characters we will get to know later.X-Wing #2 is much more fast paced and will be that kind of book that you want read in one sitting.I admit it does however geta little trying at times, Couresant is supposed to be the Empire's back yeard yet it seems at every turn we meet some new alien who is prepared to give aid to our Rouge Squadron friends.Even if you hate this book its compleation is vital to understanding the rest of the serise so even if you hate this book and couldn't bring yourself to finish it get it at the library or something."
3,3 stars,"i gave it three stars. it was okay, but something is missing without the characters of han, leia and luke. still a good read though and amazon was great in getting them to me quickly. i was very happy that they actually had them in stock as they were unavailable everywhere else i went to."
5,"Great follow-up, interesting cliff hanger","This book, the second in the X-Wing series, picks up right where the first book left off. It's a bit of a departure from the normal X-Wing stuff in that there is little actual X-wing action going on, but rather lots of ""on the ground"" fighting. But it is still really well written and enough to keep you turing the pages.There are a lot of new characters which makes it hard to keep up at points, but the author is good at keeping the pacing high and reminding you who everybody is.It also sets up a perfect lead in to book #3. I highly suggest this one to Star Wars fans who prefer a lot of action in their books."
2,Worst Book in the Series,"I read the book and I still couldn't figure out what the ""Gamble"" was that Wedge took. When Stackpole takes X-wing pilots out of the cockpit and tries to turn them into commandos, this book really slows down. I really hate a book that doesn't resolve even one detail of the plot. This is a continuation of what is really just 1 long book that doesn't end until book 3."
3,"The Rogue Squadron Tetralogy, Book 2","I understand that this series was capitalizing on the popularity of a computer game, but it would have been better if it didn't have the title of ""X-Wing.""That minor beef aside, the first 4 books of this series form a tetralogy featuring the exploits of the ace starfighter squadron. For post-Return of the Jedi novels that are not about Luke, Han and Leia, these books are not bad.As for the best novels from the era of the movie saga, I highly recommend the following 5-star novels:Cloak of Deception (Star Wars)Shadow Hunter (Star Wars: Darth Maul)Labyrinth of Evil (Star Wars, Episode III Prequel Novel)Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader (Star Wars)Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)"
4,The book is very exciting!!,"In this book we finally grt to find out how the New Republic captures Coruscant. Even though some parts are boring, the end space battle is great. I think that the book could of been better if the author made the battle a little more challenging. Rogue squadron is once again the reason for the New Republics sucess."
5,Neck & Neck between this one and Iron Fist for my favorite,"I absolutely loved this book. Even if you know minimal about star wars, this is still a great book. Stackpole pulled off a super book, so artisticly explaining how the fearless pilots of Rogue Squadron infilirated the capital of the empire, made new allies, and overthrew the heart of the Empire. Be amazed as Corran Horn manages to ensure the victory of the alliance in a single stroke of the Z-95's laser cannon. What a great book! Thumbs up to you Stackpole."
5,Inspirational and Exciting,"This book truly inspired me to motivate myself to do better. I felt that if Ben Carson, a poor inner city kid, could bring himself up to the head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins then I should be able to achieve my dreams also. I was also deeply moved by his strong faith in God and how he turned to God to help him. I believe this is one of the greatest books ever written and that everybody should read it."
3,Good inspiration for younger folks.,"I picked this book up hoping to get a glimpse of the life path of a gifted neurosurgeon. Although interesting to see how he overcame brief struggle, I agree with other reviewers that his hardships were not many or seemingly extraordinary. There was also a bit more talk of God than I had expected. I would recommend this book for teenagers or younger kids looking for some interesting and uplifting narration with a slight medical emphasis. The focus of this book is on case studies in which Dr. Carson uses his skills and knowledge to take cases feared to dangerous by others in his field."
5,Good book,"After reading this book, I rented the movie and watched that as well. I enjoyed both stories and recommend them to anyone."
3,"Amazing accomplishment, even more amazing gift of Bragging","This guy can tell you every little compliment he ever received as far back as his childhood, yet he seems to be just way too braggadocios in the way he tells it. (Especially when he tells how he was chosen as ""the most honest student at Yale""). I respect how far he has gotten in life, and the fact that he's a soft spoken man, but I just got really tired of his bragging on just about every single page of the book. I'd like to know the names of the people in his class at Yale that bested him, or at least a few of the compliments they received."
2,If you enjoy the acult...,"Simply 7th Day Adventist's propaganda. I'm not saying Carson is a bad guy, and I'm not saying his stories aren't true, but I strongly disagree with his interpretation of the Bible and the teachings of Christ. That is mostly what the book is about, 7th Day Adventist ""Christianity."" Basically, if you believe, everything in your life will be perfect. Really??? Christ himself was crucified! ""Take up your cross and follow me"" ring a bell??? Christianity is not about having a perfect wonderful life. Sounds good though. The surgical parts were interesting."
2,WARNING: This is NOT the TV Movie!!,"I ordered this thinking it was the excellent movie shown on TNT about Ben Carson's life. It's NOT. This is a 30-minute documentary. The sound and the picture are not very good quality, and it lacked the depth and and punch of the movie. This documentary is produced by Zondervan, which caters primarily to the Christian religious right, as well. I was very disappointed in the whole DVD. This is not a documentary I would show to general, secular audiences."
2,Enough !!!,"There is no denying the gifts that Ben Carson was given nor can anything take away from the good he has done, the levels he has achieved. But this book does not paint him as a very appealing person. Not particularly well written, this quickly became a tedious series of self-promotions and one wonders if he is as pleased with himself as C. Murphey leads us to believe. The message of the importance of a supportive family and persistence was lost and what could have been an inspirational biography came across as irritating and nearly impossible to relate to. Its great to be proud of your achievements, but climb down from the mountain."
1,shallow and self-congratulatory,Gifted Hands is a poorly written and unsophisticated autobiography which does little more than praise its author as second only to the god he so ceaselessly invokes. It is by far the worst book of its kind I have yet read. Try Katrina Firlik or Frank Vertosick's similar books instead.
1,Not so New,"The low review rating was given for the quality of the physical book and not its contents. The book arrived damaged, smashed, and bent on almost every corner. There was also a sticky residue on the cover. Makes me wonder if Amazon is shipping returned or damages items as New."
1,Irritating,What an egotistical blowhard. His one theme is himself and his achievements. He pontificates about everything. He is a moralistic and judgemental jerk. You don't have to listen to a guy like this. You know as much as he does.
5,Excellent!,"I read this book after seeing the movie, which also was excellent. A book you will want to share with every young person and college student. People tend to think that when someone has disadvantages and becomes great successes, as Dr. Carson did, that one thing changes for them and it's all up hill from there. This story expands in detail what the movie inspired. Hard work, overcoming life's constant battles,faith in God and the difference that a parent can make, all contributed to this man's incredible story. Definitely worth reading. I was even fascinated by the details of surgeries he performed, it gave me great appreciation for his skill, science, and our great Creator."
4,inspiring book,"This book was one of inspiration and I think it should be on the must reading list for underprivileged kids. While I enjoyed reading about this wonderful man I kept thinking, if this book inspires one child it will have done its job."
5,Gifted hands 20th Anniversary Edition,I liked the book because it gives the story of an ordinary person who was given an exceptional gift. The story tells how he came from poverty but a strong mother's influence to overcome his environment. It also tells of his faith and how it helped him as he struggled as a person and a doctor. It was an inspiring story and I recommend it for all readers.
3,book,"good story, but pages were falling out. but still readable. guess it is just an old book that has been read alot. it's ok"
4,Ben Carson,"I recommend the book Ben Carson as a good choice for reading material. The author did a good job of grabbing the readers attention by describing the separation of twins during surgery. He was able to use strong detail, so the reader was able to visualize what was actually going on in the surgery. Also, it gave the reader the opportunity to feel empathy towards the surgeons and the patients being treated because you were able to feel what they went through. The way the author describes how the twins were surgically separated and had to use 50 pints of blood to control the bleeding grasped my attention. I wanted to hear more, thus I began to thirst for added information."
4,Technical & Touching,"I recommend the book Ben Carson for reading by any middle school child... Although it had many technical terms, the narrative was riveting. It contained many verbs adjectives that clearly communicated human emotion! Obviously Mr. Carson was intent upon succeeding. The description was intense! The description of using 50 pints of blood for the surgery indicated the seriousness of the surgery. Transition phrases such as just in time, another call and the final call communicated the seriousness of the blood shortage. The graphic description of swelling indicated the brain would not fit in the skull if the surgeons did not hurry. As the reader, I wanted to shout at the writer to hurry and solve the problem. The terminology became less bothersome the more attached to the emotion of the book, the listener became. I am sure it would have been absolutely spellbinding had we heard the whole book."
5,Ben Carson - Gifted Hands,I thought this was an excellent book. Such a touching story of how a mother with 2 young boys managed to raise them by herself and encourage them to read books and strive to do well in school to make a better life for themselves. Dr. Carson is an amazing man with an extra special gift for doing intricate surgeries.
5,Book does not come close to describing the grace of this man,"I first met Dr. Carson in the fall of 1992. My daughter had already had three brain surgeries at home, but still had the tumor. Thank God we were able to get a referral to Johns Hopkins. Dr. Carson's confidence and grace reassured us that he would take care of us. And he did. His two books do no come close to representing his personality. Even without his background, this is a great man! But his absolutely amazing achievements show just how anyone can do anything, if they put their minds to it. We, too, have bought many copies of his books to give as inspirational gifts. We always have an extra here at home, just in case. We return to Baltimore every year for a follow-up exam. We always have copies of his book for autographs, which he gives in the gracious manner with which he approaches life. I feel we are honored to know this man. And we thank God for his skills."
5,Recommended reading for all young people.,"This is a true story of a child who felt he was the dumbest student in his fifth grade class. Through the demands of his single working mother, who was illiterate, he learned the value of our public libraries, received glasses, and learned to read; thereby, he discovered that he enjoyed learning. Although college and medical school were difficult, Dr. Carson found his own way to success and became one of the most illustrious neurosurgeons of our time. This gentle man asks his clients to pray before surgery; he prays and listens to classical music. He said that God guides his hands during surgery. I encourage all of my students to read this book, both to see their own possiblities and to encourage others."
5,Gifted Hands,"This is a very inspiring book, especially for young people who are having problems in school or with their peers, but also for adults. This man grew up in the most discouraging conditions, but because he had a mother who believed in him and encouraged him, his life was turned around. He is now one of the most sought after and skilled neurosurgians in this country and maybe in the world. He is also a very Godly person, which has much bearing on his position in the world."
5,A great bio of a God-fearing neurosugeon,"Despite a slow beginning, this book really achieved my expectations. It is reccomended to anyone who needs a little inspiration. Dr. Carson seems to like Siamese Twins."
3,ehh,"I'm surprised this book received such a good rating. I thought it read like a cookbook... ""I did A. Then I did B. etc."". He's clearly a gifted surgeon and a bright man but I think his writing skills are mediocre."
3,Ben's Tales,"The Gifted Hands is Ben Carson's autobiography. In the book he tells us his obstacles through his life, and how he overcome them with the god's help and hard work. Moreover, like most black men he faced several problems with racism. Ben was a man who always was focused on accomplishing of his goals.He is a very good example of endurance together with the wish of always be better in every thing. It made him to became a very good neurosurgeon, which was his principal goal, helping a lot people. However, Ben tells his milestones in a certain pride way because he always talk about that his was the one who had the best grades in the class, he talk about his conferences, the articles in the magazines which talk about him, T.V. shows in that he was present, and the way that his life affected or gave encourage to others lives, for this reason I gave to the book 3 start."
4,Interesting,"This book is not well written--it's irritating how the order of happenings is jumbled, particularly concerning Dr. Carson's earlier life--but it's an interesting read about a fascinating person and his work. For those who think Dr. Carson comes across as arrogant--I think anyone who does what he does has to have a certain amount of arrogance!"
4,A gifted story,"I recommend Ben Carson, especially to readers interested in medical events. Carson gives a detailed account of activities that occur during the separation surgery of conjoined twins. His ability to use graphic descriptions helps to keep the readers in suspense. At times it is difficult to wade through the technical terminology of medicine, but is well worth the effort. He creates a memorable account of a highly-charged situation. Carson also portrays a human side of medical professionals which assists the reader in relating to the characters."
3,A Gore or A Bore,"I do not recommend the book Ben Carson. Upon first hearing a single chapter, I was presented with a graphic description of conjoined twins being separated. There were many thoughts running through my mind as to whether the twins would make it through the operation, yet I felt as if the chapter was too scattered. The text was too scattered in that it did not flow between contexts. Some examples included switching from the operating room to a call to another hospital for more blood as well as when the twins were placed in a coma.The chapter also produced such thoughts as - does this really happen? Would there really have been such a shortage of blood when doctors know of the operating procedures? The reality of the story, however, did somewhat spark an interest but it is not something that I would allow my child to read nor would I read the text to my children either in or out of a school setting."
3,old time game,this is a old style game and it shows it. does not have the graphics that we are use to now.it is good if you want to have a game that takes you back to the time of pong.
1,Might be nice if it worked!,"BE WARNNED!!! This software did not run properly on any of my Vaio computers. And of course once opened, you own it! Wow, what a joke."
1,Does not work with Windows Vista,Ordered this along with the Atari 80 game package. Instead they sent me 2 copies of the same Activision Anthology. I tried repeatedly and the Activision Anthology does not work with my brand new Toshiba P205 laptop running Vista OS. I have 2 copies to give away. Might make nice coasters.
4,V-day gift,"My wife is happy with this watch. She got lots of compliments from ladies. She had several name brand watches before, but batteries run out and she stopped wearing them. Citizen found ingenious, good for the life time solution - Eco Drive! Reason for 4 stars is lock design: it is rather hard to put them on. The lock hook pointing backwards - some dexterity and patience required, taking them off is easy. The actual watch looked somewhat smaller than picture on the web page conveys, but dial is quite readable, rich looking and proportional to lady's hand. Price wise sale offer was unbeatable, parcel arrived on time.Thank you Amazon - you helped me to make a nice Valentine's day gift!BTW: I got an Eco-Drive's watch also as a present via Amazon and happy with them as well - go solar, go Citizen!"
5,Prettiest watch I've ever had,"I had this watch and a another Citizen watch in my wish list and my husband helped me pick this one for my birthday. He liked it because it had a rectangular face and he felt it had a retro look. I liked it for several reasons. First would be that it is an eco drive and I don't have to worry about batteries. My husband has a watch that doesn't need batteries and he is very satisfied with it. Second would be that it has a marker for each hour. I've had a dress watch for years that only has a marker for the 12, 3, 6, 9 hours and it is a little difficult to know the exact time. Next would be the bling! Not only does it have crystals around the face, but also on the bracelet links.I read all the customer comments and agree with the customer who said it was prettier in person than on the web. It is just beautiful. My husband was able to remove the links himself. I have a very small wrist and this watch does not look large on me. I have no complaints."
4,Delicate & sparkly,"The watch [face] is a bit smaller than I expected (when looking at the pictures) - hence the 4 starts instead of 5. However I DO love it - it's very pretty, sparkly, dressy and delicate. I kept the out-of-the box size which is more like a bracelet fit(removing a link or two might give it a more classic watch ""fit"" -I have a rather small wrist). The price is most certainly a GREAT deal compared to the Citizen website MSRP."
1,Didn't work,"Sadly I have tried every medicine suggested including this one for our shitzu. I have been giving her 2 tablets a day, I am almost done with the box and she still eats her poop. I am resorting to taking her to potty every time and keeping her away from it. I have lost all hope. This product must work for some and not others."
2,No evidence of this working,Could be working....don't know. But I do know that my two dogs are not losing weight.....snacking in the back yd !!! It is what beagles do.
1,Didn't work,I fed my hounds 6 pills/day for 2 weeks. They are still eating poop. Guess I'm going to have to be more vigilant at picking it up as soon as they go.
1,Made my dog SICK,"I did not realize this when purchasing, but I think these are intended for only smaller dogs. The box says to give 1 pill per day for every 10 lbs of dog. So for my 80 lb golden that = 8 pills a day. I thought that sounded ridiculous but I really wanted to get her to kick the habit. Sadly on the second day she got extremely sick. She had the worst diarrhea and it lasted days. I would not recommend this for a larger breed dog."
2,Potty Mouth,"Potty Mouth -It is easy to use, but had no affect on my dog. Did not discourage her unwanted behavior."
2,I THOUGHT it was working....,Didn't work for my little brat. I honestly thought it was going to - the first few days she didn't rush to gobble her and her brother's poop down as usual - she nibbled...and i could get her away from it...which sadly was a huge improvement. Then i honestly think she started to get used to the different taste...and we're back to square one.
1,Potty Mouth does not work,Could not tell a difference with or without using Potty Mouth product. Wish it had worked. Wasted money and time using this product.
4,Works but ad omits pills per 10 pounds of body weight,"I received my 'Potty mouth' box of 120 tabs recently. First thing I read was that it is one tab per 10 pounds of dog.Does it work? It seems to work if you give the correct number of pills per 10 pounds of body weight. My dogs are 40 pounds so 4 pills each per day. I have 3 dogs = 12 pills per day = 10 days of use. Very expensive.I use to use Adolf's unflavored meat tenderizer as many others did however, they no longer have MSG in the ingredients. MSG is what causes the dog to stop eating his feces.I would imagine that some dogs would need even more pills than indicated. For my 3, it works."
2,"Did not rid the ""problem""","I bought this product a month ago hoping it would cure my dog of her ""problem""; unfortunately it did not work. The company asks that you feed your dog 1 pill for every 10 lbs for 2 weeks (if I remember correctly) and keep up treatment at a lower dosage afterwards. After having no success with the 120-ct package purchased, I did not continue treatment so I can not comment on a long term extended use, but I can say I saw no results after the first 120 pills were gone. On a plus note, she did like the way the pills tasted."
1,Didn't work for us,These were a waste of money. They didn't work at all for our 7 month old German Shepherd. What did work was pineapple. The other reviewers were correct - it is much cheaper. Definitely try the pineapple before you purchase a product like this.
3,Heart Pendant,"I recieved this product very promptly however, the picture is a bit misleading. The necklace is beautiful don't get me wrong, but I assumed the pink color of the necklace was a light pink like its shown here. It is however a dark pink and looks almost cheaply made rather then what is shown. Its still a beautiful necklace despite the bad picture here. Oh and one more thing... if you decide to have it gift wrapped it looks cool in its little box. But if you decide to have them write a message for you its horrible. Basically they have this big card that says For You on the outside and inside is your typed message really small and not even centered in the card. I was a bit disappointed by that seeing as how its a mother's day present. Luckily the box came to me before I gave it to my mom with its little cheap card."
5,Great video with a super message for the little ones,"I got this video for my 4 year old nephew for Christmas. He loved it. As with all Veggie Tales, it has a cute story line and cute music. There is also a very simple message about fear and faith that a child that small can understand and hopefully remember.Veggie Tales are always my preferred video gifts."
4,Good but Disappointed in SweetPea/Petunia's Character,"Need to start off by saying I've been a Veggie Tales fan for years, and all of my kids are as well. We were so excited to see this new DVD--and my kids have loved it.Great message about trusting God.Only real disappointment was SweetPea/Petunia's super hero identity of ""Vogue"". Why? The message of Sweetpea Beauty was all about how beauty on the inside is what matters. Now her character is all about looking fashionable and shopping. So many other directions they could have gone with her. Girls as super heroes are rare. The Veggie Tales gang really blew it in this regard.Still no doubt your kids will enjoy this!"
3,Rock Music in a Veggie Tale (Toddler) Movie?,"I am a pretty open minded woman of 59 years. After buying 2 Veggie Tale DVD's for my grand children,I must say that the music was not appropriate for their ages, 2 and 4 years old. Never have I had to be concerned with anything the Veggie Tale producers provide for entertainment until now. This is one of two new movies that have music for adults or teens intertwined with the movie. It seems they are promoting these groups, but please not on Veggie Tales! We want to hear pickles and asparagus singing. If you hear the music you may understand my concern. This will be my last purchase of these movies...sad."
5,Excellent Heroes!,What a lot of fun......my son is still bouncing just about any toy off of just about any surface because Ricochet was so engaging!
5,Whole Family LOVES THIS!,"This is the cutest show! The League of Incredible Vegetables is a new family favorite at our house! Not only is this a fun show for all of us but it's a great lesson in handling fear. It teaches that we all get scared, even superheroes. :) VeggieTales consistently makes shows that I love to watch with my kids!"
1,NO NEON?,"When I looked at the picture on my computer it appeared to have neon on it. It also stated in the writtten description there was neon?? When I received the picture there was NO NEON, just lights. The lights were so bright we could not leave them on. The company had so many restrictions on returning the product I decided I would have to keep it, since I think there was a short return time and I could not meet their criteria."
4,Good for the price,"I wanted something to use while mowing the lawn without emptying my bank account. Cuts the lawnmower noise to a tolerable level, and the sound quality is decent. Headphones are comfortable and adjust easily. Unit collapses down to a more manageable size for transportation. Good battery life."
3,Tricky Description,"I bought these thinking they'd at least say Skullcandy on them, but the packaging is so lame and has some cell company's name on it. Included with in the package was a crappy and little white piece of paper saying how they are MANUFACTURED by Skullcandy. I was very disappointed. Now I have to explain they are made by Skullcandy which is really cheesy."
1,Check with seller before ordering,"I ordered these because Skullcandy offers a great warranty and really stands behind their product. Unfortunately, I received Amp'd Mobile headphones, like so many other reviewers have noted. VibeCellular was the seller. I got my money back in an A-to-Z claim, so no harm, but the headphones were NOT skullcandy quality. In fact, the noise cancelling feature did not work at all. I wonder if these are just knock-offs made to look like skullcandy."
4,Skull candy headset,Very good sound and feel for the price. The battery is in a bit of a weird area ...but just keep one battery in when you aren't using and it will never accidentally turn on (draining the batteries).
5,100% Awesome!,"These headphones do the trick!Noise Cancelling, can compact very small for easy storage.Thank you for this top quality product."
4,Check out the Creative HN-700 instead!,"They're the same headphones for $30 less on amazon and at the creative store as well. If you don't believe me, compare the pictures. They're identical and the specifications are the same as well! Save some money! Buy the creative version!"
3,Not As Good As I'd Hoped,"I purchased these from Vibe Cellular and was sent a ""branded"" version stamped with Amp'd mobile all over it. Vibe claims they're the same kind, but since I have no way to verify that, take this review with that in mind...Overall the phones are comfortable and easy to use. The only issue I have with them is that it seems their version of noise canceling is to include a low level of white noise to the mix. Now, while it does cancel out some of the ambient noise, it also, to my ears cancels out some of the music, which is unfortunate. Luckily they weren't expensive - about $30 - so it's not a huge loss, but I had hoped for a bit more."
3,It's allright,"It isn't that comfortable, but it does work pretty well as a noise killer, but when it is on you can hear some backround weird hissing. I guess that is how the ambient noise is killed. Also the cord was under my chair and it severed the feed, but the good thing is that the head phone cord is remvable, so probably I am going to have to buy another cord to make it work, but other than that it is alright.I got weird stares with these, but I don't care because I HATE earbuds. The sound is terrible and they aren't comfortable (but then again, this wasn't as comfy as I thought it would). This is a discontinued product anyway, so I might go with a non-skullcandy brand in the future."
1,Watch your ears.,"Bought these as a replacement for my Panasonic RPHC300 noise-cancelling headphones, which I was very happy with, but which broke on me. These were slightly cheaper and cool-looking, so I took a chance.Unfortunately, not only is the sound a little muffled and bassy, but the ""noise-cancelling"" actually produces a nearly-painful low-frequency thudding sound. It's faint, but it seems to produce pressure on the ear in the closed space within the over-the-ear headphone. After a couple of days with these (and I wear headphones 12-15 hours a day as part of my job), my right ear was ringing. This still has not entirely gone away. Sent an email to Skullcandy days ago, asking if this was some kind of malfunction, but still have not received a reply, hence seeking relief here.So, to sum up: sound -- not great; noise-cancelling -- disastrous. If you buy these, I recommend NOT using that feature."
3,Great ergonomics - sucky sound,"Be sure to read my comparison over at the Sennheiser PXC-250. I compared them head-to-head and I recommend you do the same.The problem with headphones is that you really need to try them on and listen to them to decided. I'm a bit of an audio snob and I didn't like the way the SCs NC screwed with the sound. That said, the Sennheisers sounded great but absolutely sucked in terms of ergonomics. And everything sennheiser did wrong, SkullCandy got right.If you could get Sennheiser's sound engineering in SkullCandy's design, Bose wouldn't get away with selling their $300 headphones.BTW, search around. The same headphones are sold under other brands. I've seen Logitech and Symphony branded headphones that looked and spec'd identical to the SkullCandy's."
2,"Poor Man's ""Bose""","[Please note: I give this product 4 stars, not 2. I could not change that].The headphones basically do what they claim to do. They are light and comfortable. I like the design. They look a lot like the first Bose version, but are a bit bigger. The batteries go into the headphone part, so there is no clumsy ""battery box"" externally, which is nice. Sound I would rate a 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being best). Noise cancellation is pretty decent. There is a minor problem with the NC, though. When mine is turned and I am plugged into a laptop or Ipod, I get a loud buzzing noise. When I unplug the Ipod from the wall power source, the buzzing stops. If that bugs you, I would not recommend them. But they are decent when you are not hooked into a wall power source, and are very similar to Bose's NC headphones, which cost about 6 times more. I can recommend them, for this price. Would be good on a plane trip if you are not a ""snob"" in terms of sound."
4,Excellent Noise Canceling,"I recently purchased these headphones after my Sony MDR-NC6 headphones broke after a year of heavy use. The Skullcandy headphones were purchased primarily for use on plane and also in an office environment. These headphones do an excellent job of blocking out noise typical of an office environment and did a decent job on the plane (there was still a bit of noise that got through). Overall, the noise canceling for these headphones work great and works without the hissing and popping that I often heard with my old Sony headphones. In terms of the sound quality, it is a little on the quiet side, but still sounds pretty good. The sound quality is the only reason why I didn't give these headphones 5 stars. Also, as another reviewer mentioned his concern with the battery life, I pretty much had the noise canceling on for about a 40 hour work week before the batteries died.Noise Canceling - 5Sound Quality - 4Durability - 5Portability - 4Comfort - 4"
3,Amp'd Mobile headphones are NOT Skullcandy headphones.,"I ordered ""these"" headphones for $25.00 the other day, which is a good deal. Haven't used them much or at all actually. Just surprised when I opened the box to find Amp'd Mobile Noise-cancelling headphones and not Skullcandy Proletariat headphones. They're definitely the same headphones but are rebranded. I just thought it was weird and a little misleading. No where does it say they may be Amp'd headphones and I wasn't notified by the seller of any sort of change. Or at all for that matter."
1,Disappointed in Amazon and Vibecellular,"Amazon and Vibecellular represent these headphones to be scullcandy brand, which they clear ARE NOT. When this order arrived today, I found that the brand is amp'd mobile. I also learned that Vibecellular's phone mailbox does not accept any messages, and they don't answer the phone number included with the product. At the Amazon site, I learned that Vibecellular will charge me for shipping and restocking and only accepts returns for broken/defective products, not products sold under false pretenses. I used Amazon believing that unsatisfactory products could be returned for refund and am surprised/disappointed to find this is not the case. IF YOU BUY FOR TEENAGERS, TO WHOM BRAND CAN MATTER, BEWARE SHOPPING FOR ELECTRONICS WITH AMAZON. I'll never do that again!"
1,Not Skull Candy Brand,I received my headphones yesterday and was surprised that I did not get what I ordered.I was supposed to get the Skull Candy brand but received Amp'd Mobile brand. There was a note stating that these are the same as the Skull Candy. Quite disappointing!
1,Version,I bought this software on the recommendation of my father who uses it regularly. I was astonished at the price on jumped on the purchase. To my dismay I purchased a copy for Tax Year 2003. This information should have been listed in the details on the product. Glad I didn't pay too much for it.
1,Awful software,"Very poorly done. No ability to search for an item type (e.g. 'gym bag') -- need to poke around the categories to see if you find it. Entered items in the 'Other' category and it duplicated them every time I saved, so I ended up with many copies of the same entry. Makes me question other H&R Block software."
1,Not worth the money,"This program is basically a simple database that allows you to enter your donations. It will help you value your donations, but it's difficult to do in the program. You need to know which category your item is listed under before you can find it's value in this program. It doesn't let you search for your item to find the value. I don't see any value in this program. Entering all of your donations in this program is a hassle. It's easier to enter them directly into your tax program."
1,This software stinks!,"Warning: After successfully saving my file, I continued to input over 100 line items in this program (a very time consuming task). When finished, I tried to save but received an error message. Then when I tried to open my file, the message said it wasn't a valid file format. My file was corrupted and cannot be retrieved, and the technical support had no idea how it happened or whether it could happen again. I am in the process of returning this program.The non-cash charitable contribution section is a great idea, but it's cumbersome: you have to scroll down a very long list each time (no key words). Plus, there are many every-day items that aren't on the list; bicycle helmet is, but dishware isn't.I haven't tried the alternative, but this program is awful."
1,It is useless!!!,I bought the software and the first step it requires you to do is to enter organization name and address. It gives you so little space for both that I can't even enter my church name in a meaningful way. I can barely enter street address of all the organizations. I have to use the TaxCut software to modify the names once they are imported. It's useless! The only good thing is that I do get my rebate so at least it's free.
1,Worst software ever made,H&R goes beyond stinking on this pieces of bad software..after wasting 1 hr on this lousy piece of crap..it wont even import my file..wish I could take then to court for wasting my time...
2,got robbed by AT&T,"4 star for the phone and no star for AT&T.; The phone itself is pretty good but buyers (purchasing the plan), beware of the ""fruadulent"" billing by AT&T.; I was billed and paid (didn't realize this until sometime later) for a bill that was for the period before I received the phone. Even more upsetting was the fact that AT&T; rep. is not willing to resolve this matter stating that I called too late. He first said, he can't do anything on something that is 90 days past. When I pointed out to him that it's been around 60 days, he changed his statement and said, he can't help me because it's been over 60 days.In addition, I used to frequently get calls looking for the person who previously owned this number. Which obviously, used up my miuntes (for answering and checking messages that are not for me).I am upset!"
1,Phone is Cool ATT is not,"DO NOT BUY FROM ATT, Ive been with them for 4 months and they have yet to send me a correct bill. Their customer service Lie to you about what they can and can't do to fix your issues. I have spent 12 hours on the phone with their customer service to fix their billing issues and they will give no compinsation for my pain. Furthermore i told them they were in breach of contact and i wanted out since they have yet to give an accurrate bill. They said that would cost me 400 dollars. No Arbitaition, no customer service what so ever. They cant even be sure that they have fixed the issue. I WILL BE SWITCHING as soon as my contact is up. Look for a nice set of these phones on Ebay in about 8 months.Craig - Sacramento CA"
1,Terrible phone in NYC,"This is a terrible phone in NYC (Manhattan) with AT&T service. I'm very sorry I didn't return it in the 30-day period, as my signal strength is awful nearly everywhere, and I'm unable to use it in some rooms of my apartment. I never had that problem with Sprint or T-Mobile."
3,Neat,For the price this phone has all of the features. Sony Ericcson have never made a good phone so it does not work very well. It needs a flash on the camera. I alo think it sholud be a flip phone.
1,AT @ T old company outdated Customer Service,"I have ATT for wireless shared plan, I have a great deal of problems with the their customer service, and the plan are outdated with the competetion, they need to catch up with the other world."
1,Problematic AT & T Customer Sevrice,"After I placed the order from Amazon, I called the ATT customer service to work with the phone plan. As I haven't got enough amount ($800) in my debit card account, the guy told me to go to a ATT direct store to pay the phone service deposit of $800. When I got to the store, the representative told me that I cannot pay the deposit without a phone number. And they seems do not know anything about the connection of Amazon with ATT about this phone + service plan. After several visits to that shop, I still cannot get a phone number. I finally cancelled the order from Amazon. I think the representatives in ATT do not know much about the system of their company and they really need more training before they can serve customers."
1,Don't do it!,"What ever you do - do not order ATT online. I did and even ATT customer service has been unable to help me. The first phone I got did not work - after many calls and twice as many hours I got a replacement phone, I also got a bill for the replacement phone but I am still waiting on a credit for the one that I sent back - it has been four months now. Their problems resolution department acknowledged that they owed me a credit but said that they were getting the same run around from the online division and were powerless to do anything about it! So I am out an extra $142 with no recourse. They are scum - don't waste your money."
1,Student,"I have had three phones in my life and this was, by far the most sophisticated and, by far, the worst. The camera is worthless, even in the daylight. It kept saying that I had no memory so I deleted the bad pictures that came with it. That did not help. So basically I can't receive text messages. My roommate and I both have the same service but always has a much better signal.The worst feature is the loud cracking sound that happens about once every minute. It is much louder than the voice on the other end and acturally hurts when it happens.The internet takes forever to load...when it works.The sim card dislodges in the middle of a conversation.I'm buying a new phone tomarrow after having this one for much too long."
1,pain in the ass!,"okay, I've had this phone for 6 months now though T-mobile. Thank god I bought the warranty because I've gone throught 2 replacement phones and spent probably about 5 hours at the Tmobile store trying to get the bluetooth hooked up to my G4 ibook. Bluetooth was about 1/2 the speed of a dial-up phone connection. A cool toy, but not really practical for surfing the web. Granted, I do live in a basement apartment, but the only way I get reception inside is to stand right next to the window. Also, I need to keep the phone locked at all times, because otherwise it starts calling random numbers in my phone book. I'm counting down the months until I can get a new phone."
3,Dont get it for it's camera.,"when I got the phone, it would not let me save pictures so I had to return it for a replacement. The replacement works. Everything is fine but the camera takes lousy pictures, due to relatively low resolution. The Samsung 715 takes much better pictures but is more expensive and works only with TMobile."
4,One of the nicest products I have seen in a long time,"The phone looks amazing, and works even better. What I like most about it is the ease of use. I do not have the time to tinker with a gadget for an hour to find out how a particular thing works. With this phone, it is really easy to browse through the menu and find out what I am looking for. The PDA feature is also great. If you use your PDA strictly for business purposes, now you can easily do without it as the phone keeps track of all your appointments and phonebook just fine. The bluetooth headset I installed also works fine and if the device is on any call is transferred to the headset automatically. Overall, the phone is a good purchase but I am a little skeptical about AT&T service. From what I have seen, the coverage seems pretty limited (and if you call the customer service for any reason, expect to be on hold for a long time - about 10-20 minutes)."
1,The WORST service ever(still haven't received the phone)!!!,"I ordered the phone on 12.17.03 and was promised receipt in 3 business days. After unsuccessfully attempting to reach a customer service rep for over a week(waiting on hold for over an hour on 12.23) I was told on 12.29 that my order was indeed submitted, there is/was no way of knowing when the phone would arrive and that my order could not be nullified.I called again today, 01.13.14, and was given the same story.AT&T is the absolute WORST and deserve noone's business...end of story!"
1,So bad that words can't do it justice,"I know it sounds like I am exaggerating, but I honestly think this phone is the worst purchase I have ever made in my adult life. From day one I had problems with reception, with the volume and with a constant ""SIM Card Dislodged"" error message. It only got worse over time. The display is essentially impossible to read in sunlight or even interior light brighter than a 60-watt bulb. The photos are awful. I've had the phone barely a year and it has essentially stopped working now. It'll be a cold day in hell before I give Sony Ericcson any more of my money."
4,"Excellent phone, but ATT not excellent","To start, the phone is a very nice phone. It comes with many features, feels solid and high quality in your hands, and it is small and stylish with a large color screen. The drawlback of the phone are that the display is hard to see in bright light. Also, it can be hard to use until you get used to all the menus and such. Overall, this phone is an excellent phone and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.But ATT tested my anger managment skills. They charged more than the starting price and added on all the extra cost features that I didn't ask for! They also charged 88 dollars for roaming when I went to New York! The service also isnt very good. sometimes it switches to the cingular tower or the verizon tower. It's your money, and I would go with T-mobile personally. Better yet, Verizon."
2,t616,"i left verizon and went to att, huge mistake, the att service is horrible, my phone usually has at the most 2 bars and often says no network,i live in in a very large city and would expect good serivce. the t616 has many good features but i know other customers who have different phones and get better service than i do. my advice look for another phone and another service provider"
4,Sony Ericsson T616 @ Bytesector.com,"Sony Ericsson is one of the leading manufactures in the cell phone market and has constantly produced phones that have not only met but exceeded the expectations of cell phone users. Their new, high-tech cell phone, the Sony Ericsson T616, is no exception. With its quality 65 536 color display, extensive picture sharing options, the latest messaging, built in camera, Bluetooth wireless technology, and several, several other features, it is no wonder why the T616 in my opinion is one of the best .....read more @ Bytesector.com"""
1,Major pain in the you-know-where,"Pros:-Looks pretty.Cons:-UI lags behind button presses in every area.-Reception sporadic, especially in cars.-Camera is awful (even at highest resolution, images always look blurred and are sometimes unrecognizable).-Bluetooth frequently causes phone to freeze up (must be restarted).And most annoying of all...-Causes interference with anything with a speaker from up to five feet away. I don't know if it's checking if I have voicemail or what, but almost anything within five or six feet that has a speaker chirps a little machine song every minute or so. I've never had this problem with a phone before and it drives me NUTS.Either spend the extra money for the T637, or get a different phone entirely - just don't waste your time and patience on THIS."
1,Avoid ATT Wireless,"AT&T; wireless GSM coverage is a joke. They will blame anything on it too: hurricane, sunspots, ""It's new technology,"" ""somebody didn't renew antenna tower contracts"" (that is on Interstate 95, if you can believe it). Don't do it!!! You will eventually be very unhappy!!! If you have a brief weakness and try it out, and you get their service, and have slight problems in the first 30 days, then send the phone back IMMEDIATELY. You are, otherwise, consigning yourself to whatever they want to do to you.DO NOT sign a contract with them. That is the only thing that has saved me is that I couldn't bring myself to sign the contract. That means that I have two phones that cost me [a lot]--because the rebate requires the contract--but at least I don't have to give them money for service that reminds me of spotty cell phone service ten years ago.'Love the phone? Find another carrier!!!Good luck..."
2,Phone great ATT terrible,"After HOURS on the phone trying to get assistance with ATT and getting no where but transferred and put on hold, I have cancelled my service. They could not port my number like I was told. They gave me the run around all the time, I ended up with 7 different numbers to try all the time. And many times their computers were down or the department that I needed was closed.But the phone works great!"
1,AT&T Suck,I got the phone and love it. I called AT&T 3 times trying to active my phone and port my number but all I got was waiting and waiting and waiting... What good of a phone when I can't get some one to activate it. This is really suck.
3,AT&T customer support service sucks!!,"I bought this phone online from AT&T which was a BIG mistake. I had questions about a few things before the phone is shipped and I was put onhold for 3 hours! I tried several days calling their customer support and was put onhold for hours every time. When I did get to a person, I would be given many other phone #s to try and I ended up running in circles for nothing. So, I decided that I don't want to deal with this and just return the phone. It took me yet another few hours of calling before I can finally get the return label shipped to me!! The experience is horrific and I will NEVER buy anything from AT&T online."
1,shipping delay,"Just wanted to let everyone know. The time from order to shipping on this phone is over a week which means that it's probably too late to order for Xmas at this point. The TMobile T610 ships almost immediately.The other thing to consider is that the TMobile T610 is actually cheaper than this phone since the supposed -$150 price is only for a two year contract. With a one year contract, the price is only -$75. TMobile with one year contract is -$100.Also TMobile has better service plans."
3,cell phone,i think that this is a pretty nice phone its lasted for a long time and has been dropped many times with very little damage. the best part about this phone is that it is simple and easy to understand. plus it has the coolest jumpnrun game on it ever! ok yea so the game deepabyss probably made this phone better since all the other games on it are kinda dumb..the worst part about this phone is that the joystick starts to get kinda sticky after a while.. but keep in mind that i have owned this phone for a long timeoverall its a pretty good phone not a very good camera thou
5,"Superb, powerful & versatile cell phone!!!!!!","Excellent phone! Very sleek, stylish and easy to use once you fiddle around for a couple of hours. Has a plethora of options and is extremely customizable. Digital camera is a great feature, and works very easily with special effects such as sephia, black & white, negative, and night mode. Large display is vivid and clear. Last but not least, the battery life is POWERFUL for such a little phone. Only negatives I can conjure up is the fact that the keys sometimes get stuck, and also the phone does smudge easily, although very scratch-resistant. I would HIGHLY recommend this phone to anyone with AT&T carrier."
1,The phone is nice but AT&T service is bad,"AT&T wireless as a company is not prepare to service any customer. Please try their customer support line before ordering the phone. You will be on hold for hours and at the same time the department that handles your number porting is different from the ordering derpartment which is also different from normal customer service. If there is any issue, there is no single point of help so you will end up waiting hours on hold.The phone is nice but don't get the service from AT&T. The provider is bad."
5,Holds Up Over Time,"I recently took a stroll down memory lane and bought a bunch of music from my youth and this isone of the few cd's that DIDN'T end up as a disappointment. I got the same chills hearing""Knife Edge"" and ""Deeside"" for the first time in 15 years as I did when I was 15 years old hearingthem for the very first time. The extra bonus tracks are nice, but the meat of this album are theoriginal tracks. Highly recommended."
5,No more muscle aches!,"I started taking statins some time ago and suffered muscle pains as many do. My doctor recommended CoQ10, but it was so expensive in every store I checked locally that I just suffered. Finally I checked Amazon and there was a huge bottle at a little price. After one week - no more muscular pain. I would recommend this product to ANYONE who takes a statin for high cholestrol."
4,pricey,"completely overpriced here, but an essential supplement. my 180-cap, 100 mg bottle was 64 bucks at a health food store.the Vcap (cellulose) capsule is the best vehicle for this, as softgels contain gelatin (not so good for you). take it with a good liquid fish oil/DHA supplement to maximize its effects.check with your doctor of course, but higher mg amounts (400 mg) of this may be required for serious repair of health issues. 100 mg is fine (for me, at least) as a daily dosage."
5,A good read,This was a well-detailed book. It's also fun to read it now (in 2013) and know what happened to all those grandchildren she wrote about in the 1970s.
4,Very good western! Interesting story line with Chris Reeve in a different type of role.,It's nice to see Chris Reeve in a different type of role. Lot of tension and plenty of action. A very good story!
3,Good for Basic Introduction to Animals,"This book covers a lot of animals, with one page dedicated to each. The pages are pictures with captions, and very little other text describing the animals. Since I picked this book up for homeschooling, I have found I need a lot of other resources (library books and Internet) to get substantial information. But it's a great book for kids to flip through and familiarize themselves with different animals."
2,limited,This book is OK if you are looking for a book that is interesting for kids to read or be read to from. However it is not very compleat in its content or animals offered. I am working on finding an alternitive to this book for a science curriculum.
1,Drowning in Jargon,"""Orthodox, humanist notions of the literary confession, and its assumed relationship to truth authority and subjectivity are challenged, in their place a range of critical perspectives and practices are adopted, utilizing the insights of contemporary critical theorists. Modern Confessional Writing develops and tests new, theoretically-informed perspectives on what confessional writing is, how it functions and what it means to both writer and reader. When read from these new perspectives modern confessional writing is liberated from the misconception it provides a kind of easy authorial release and readerly catharsis, and is instead read as a discursive, self-reflexive, sophisticated and demanding genre.""Read this description and discern 1) what it means 2) whether it is grammatical or even sensical. This book's description could serve as an example of why academic publishing has become so deeply unpopular, inept, and unprofitable."
4,Moving and hilarious,"A funny and elegant meditation on the search for faith, love, and self-discipline. We care about Weaver, though he seems a bit brainwashed by his pro-life sect, because he tempers the sincere desire for moral certainties with great humanity. His life is aimless, but he does no harm. He is an astute skeptic when it comes to his religious group. He falls for a ""fallen"" woman while valiantly struggling to reconcile his ridiculous moral absolutes with fuzzy gray realities. Beautifully written, the book offers no easy answers to moral ambiguities, which is exactly the point."
5,Aresome Speaker system !,"I didn;t use this for pc but for home theather, was actually quite good, sub is big, i heard z5500 is bigger and fix little bit of z680 problem, so i probably won;t recommand u get z680 over z5500 or the new wireless one unless u find price much lower than those 2, but his one is aleady fully loaded, support DTS, THX, a must for DTS sound fan, however Dolby is almost not much are impress codec in this speaker. Overall Excellent value."
2,Should be better for the price,"I recieved the speakers and hooked everything up and they worked fine accept for one problem. The sub vibrated like it had been busted. So, I sent them back and got a new set and hooked them up, and guess what? A nice vibrating sub not as bad but it still sounded like crap. I don't know if I just happened to get unlucky and get two bad sets of speakers or what. But when something like this happens it doesn't give me much faith in a company or its other products. The satellite speakers sounded nice but if you don't have the whole unit working the way it should it doesn't matter. When I pay this much for something I expect it to work, especially after reading all of these great reviews about it."
5,Simply Amazing,"These speakers are fantastic. The only problem with them is trying to find the right spot to put the surround sound, which shouldn't be too difficult. There are a few different settings that are on the control box of the speakers for movies or music or just 6 channel direct. I watched a few DVDs with these speakers on the movie mode and it felt like I was at the movie theater but I was in the comfort of my own home. There is no doubt that these speakers are #1 right now for gaming. I'm a big gamer and play RPGs and FPS alike. You can hear the sounds coming from all around you. Not only will these speakers make the experience much better for gaming, they will make you a better gamer too! In certain games like Counter-Strike I was able to hear footsteps around me much easier and shooting too so I knew where to go to get to them easier. If you watch movies or play any games on your computer and you are serious about it, these speakers are a must."
3,too noisy,"Steady noise even when the speaker volume is turned all the way down. For loud games/rock music the speakers are great, but for classical music or just as standard computer speakers, beware if you're sensitive to noise. The remote is nice and the 3 way input - optical, coax, and 6 ch is very nice. Means you can plug in an external system (in my case a keyboard) without having the computer turned on."
3,Vibration Noise From Funnel of Subwoofer,"After 3 weeks of using the z-680 on a DVD Player, the z-680 started to develope a sever hum from the plastic funnel on the side of the subwoofer. I recommend using the Creative Inspire 6.1 6700 system. I have used the Creative 6700 for about a year and no problems yet."
3,Too many problems for the price,"My husband and I spent 2 full days trying to get these speakers to actually play digital sound. The manual is worse than useless. The satellite speakers put out a terrible hiss. We have the Soundblaster Audigy 2 soundcard, pretty close to the top of the line, so we've got digital capability. Eventually we did get them to work (would it have killed them to tell us that in the DVD player audio config, you need to set the audio output to SPDIF if you've got an external Dolby 5.1 decoder? Also, you do have to set your card to Digital output only, which will cause audio problems due to Windows) and yeah, they sound great. In fact, the hiss went away once we finally got everything configured. But for the price this set costs, this is way too painful and confusing."
1,Hunk of junk,"This crappy monitors have nothing but a nightmare, bought them on february 27th and it hasn't even been a year and the subwoofer's broken already, the rest of the system works but the darn sub is broken, I'm going to get new ones since I used them for monitoring 5.1 mixes and I'm certainly not buying Logitech speakers ever again. THEY SUCK!"
5,This System Is IT!,"This is the only system you would need for your TV/Computer. I installed it and relized when the BASS was on halfway my Ceiling lamps shook, to the extent that they were about to fall. If u live on the second floor of and apartment Be AWARE! This Baby Make A Lot Of Noise But Is Worth EVERY PENNY! You Will Not Be Unsatifiyed with a product like this. Amazon is Great Shipping and Customer Service."
4,Good Speakers,I have had these speakers now for two weeks. I have excellent hearing and I do get the hiss that everyone talks about. Still fiddling around with them as far as placement and that. Have them hooked up to a Mac G5 via the toslink cable. They do sound great except for that annoying hiss. Other than that I would definately recommend them. Good price from Amazon.
5,These speakers are the best you can buy for the price,"I bought these speakers specifically to hook up with my xbox, playstation 2, and gamecube. If you own especially an xbox and are looking for a way to get the most out of your games and movies buy these speakers. I hooked them up and whatched a movie and was shocked at how good they sound and how loud they are. I have researched a lot on speakers in this price range and nothing is even comparable to what you'll get with these for the price."
5,Great system for the price!,"This system is absolutely marvelous for the price. The overall system is very clean and crisp sounding. The bass is out of this world, I had some things on the table above it, and when I turned the bass all the way up the stuff started rattling off the table. Great value!"
5,"I love the speakers. They just rock, plain and simple",If you have a chance to pick the speakers up. I highly recommend it. I would from a two speaker and a sub set up to these bad boys. It is night and day you will not be disappointed. The base on these things will shake the house is great.I used to not be that much in the sound. I do to speaker set up was in the music didn't really think about it. Man I wish I bought these a long time ago! They're that good enjoy them. I know you will.One thing that makes these great is that they use speaker wire so you can set the speakers at any length of wire. Just get a cut to fit.
2,Not a dictionary of current American pronunciation,"I needed a dictionary of current American pronunciation for ESL teaching and I made the mistake of purchasing this item due to its high rating. If you're in the market for a dictionary which reflects current pronunciation stay clear of this one since it was published in 1943. No language is stagnant and thus a 60-some-year-old dictionary is not doing current American pronunciation justice. It's also lacking with regards to actual words listed (you won't find 'pizza' for example or any IT expressions obviously) and it's obviously not reflective of modern day predominant pronunciation. Contrary to what this dictionary will tell you, words such as cod, caught, bother, father, rock, and coffee (to name a few) are all today predominantly pronounced with the back vowel /a:/ in American English."
3,Appalling errors,"When I began using this book, I questioned my pronunciations. It turns out, there are a number of errors in this book. This is an appalling state of affairs for a reference book put out by the Merriam-Webster company. Where was the editor? ... This is also 50 years old! Go with the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary. It is far superior and was just updated in 2000."
2,Pity about the key,"This book is adequate, and it is exactly what it claims to be; nothing more or less. It's just that in the pronunciation key in the begining of the book, and subsequently on every page thereafter, there is a mistake. The word 'pity' is given as 'pItI. In other words, both vowls are to be pronounced identically. Who talks like that? The pronunciations given in the book are the same for 'pittied' and 'pitted'. I can see making a mistake on some entry buried three quarters of the way through the book. But this is IN THE KEY!"
3,Don't bother.,What nonsense. Very disappointed in this book and wasn't at all helpful in using it as a resource... which is what it's made for. Very hard to read and not set out well.
2,Out of date,"As a few others have pointed out, this is a 1990s reprint of a book written in 1943. Accepted pronunciation has changed in small but significant ways since then. We can easily understand movies like The Philadelphia Story, with Katharine Hepburn & Cary Grant, but we don't expect people to talk like that anymore.This dictionary is ok if you want a dated pronunciation (which may indeed sound ""cultured""), or if you are willing to figure out a few rules for updating these pronunciations. But I prefer the Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English, by Upton, Kretzschmar, and Konopka. It has American (and British) IPA transcriptions and was brand new in 2001. It's more expensive but is reliable and up-to-date."
3,not enough phonetic symbols...,this book needs more description and details about the phonetic symbols to pronounce correctly. it's not easy to follow it word by word.
3,Old version but useful,"I bought the old version of the book as it is inexpensive. However, it is useful and not many changes compared to new version."
4,I saw it on TV and bought it to keep,"Generally excellent but somewhat disjointed documentary that reviews the various pterosaurs and documents a group of paleontologists and engineers as they attempt to design a flying replica based on the latest findings.The pterosaur paleontology bits are good and the engineering bits are good. It's where they're stitched together that some cracks in the seams appear. There's also a pointless sidetrack as a gonzo paleontologist tries vainly to find proof of the existence of a jumbo pterosaur.What's never addressed is how the pterosaurs evolved when any one or two of their specialized body structures would have doomed them until they assembled enough specializations to achieve flight. That's potentially the most interesting thing about pterosaurs, yet it's never totally glossed over."
5,Beautiful,"great anklet, sturdy. I've been wearing it months through showers, baths, tanning beds and multiple lotion applications, and it still looks great. I would say this runs just slightly smaller then the listed length, just a touch so that it does bind if your a bigger girl."
5,Happy with the fit.,"I always have trouble finding the right fit for anklets so I wasn't optimistic with ordering this one but for the price, I didn't think it would be a total loss if I got it and it didn't fit. First, it came super fast which is great. And I am happy to report it fits! I have Samoan ankles so it's not easy finding my size lol.I love it so much I'm ordering another one. Very happy customer!!"
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed when it arrived. First of all it was tarnished. The silver had black lines all around it after just coming out of the package and I understand silver does do this overtime but it should not do it before I even get it. And the 10"" was way to big. Just disappointed in general. Hopefully Amazon will give me a refund and I can buy one elsewhere."
5,great product,I purchase 4 of these. They are great. I need the longer length and these are just what I wanted. I wear ankle bracelets all the time and they break. The one I started with has not broken yet and is in great shape.
4,PERFECT,"I recently broke my anklet and have been looking for one like it for several weeks...I saw this one and it was exactly like my old one and in the right size. When I received it, it was PERFECT!!!! I was so happy, I put it on and it hasn't been off yet. I am going to by a couple more plus some braclets...I love this website. The sterling silver is gorgeous-looks tasteful. I love the lobster clasp as well. I have already shown several of my friends and given them this website!!! Thanks for having great products and great service"
3,This Book Definitely Has A Good Message,"I thought that Street Life had a good start to it as well as a good message to young black men of what will inevitably happen to them if they choose the street life. This book also had pretty good jokes from the main character. The reason I gave the book 3 stars though is near the end of the book this thing just went all over the place. I know the author was trying to send a positive message out but I started getting confused because I was like ""ok has this book turned from fiction to nonfiction, is the author writing about himself or what?"" It's ok to take pieces of reality and put it into fiction but this just got crazy. Although I was disappointed towards the end of the book, I would still recommend at least borrowing this from someone and reading it if you don't buy it yourself."
3,Great knife - don't like the company who sold it!,"I purchased this knife as a Christmas present for my father. This is a great brand and I love these knives but I will never purchase from this seller again (Amazing Deals Online). They aren't so amazing after all! The purchase price was $44.95 plus shipping and when I received it, the knife was loose and cutting at the packaging so I had to open it up to fix it as I didn't want to give it as a present like that. Then, the best part.....I flipped the box over and there...stuck to the bottom of the box was a price tag from JCPenney showing the knife at a regular price of $49.99 but on sale for $19.99. Whomever shipped it forgot to remove the price tag showing what they paid for it. Amazon is great though and I called and they gave me a credit for the difference. Next time, I'll go to JCPenney's to purchase these knives as they are much cheaper or find one for sale directly through Amazon. Poor job Amazing Deals Online!"
5,Excellent!,Gave this as a gift to a J.A. Henkels collector. She said this paring knife completes her collection.
4,Mario has grown and matured,"I luv the growth and maturity on this album. Mario is showing the world that he too can be romantic, loving, caring and sexual. This album is a must buy."
4,He's got me GOing!! Whoo!,"I'm gonna keep this short & sweet...but I am in LOVE!! I've been a so-so Mario fan since he fist came out and always enjoyed all of his singles. Then a few days ago, something prompted me to download the album and man am I glad I did! I can't get enough of Kryptonite and wonder why I never heard it on the radio, I mean it's FIRE!! All of his ballads are on point, of course. I mean wow, talk about underrated artistry. And if you like this album then get ready for ""And Then There Was Me"" I already have most of the potential tracks on repeat. ""Inside of You"" better be a single or else I'm just convinced that people have lost their taste for GOOD music!!"
5,I love Mario,I love this CD. Mario has come a very long way. I love the song Crying Out For Me and Do Right(this song is about his mother struggle with drug abuse). Mario is only 21 but you couldn't tell by his music.
2,CAUTION!!!,"Please don't make the same mistake I made. This program and ""The American Sign Languaje Dictionary on CD-Rom"" are exactly the same program.If you are running XP, you will have problems installing Hypersign. Eventhough, the program says to be XP compatible, I did run into some problems installing Hypersign.The other 3 programs are ok."
1,It's useless,"It was the most horrible radio I have ever had. From the left end of the FM dial until 103.3 the only station that has reception is 103.3. It is useless. The sound quality is poor, there are two the volume: very low to very loud instantly. The customer service is lousy. 1 star is too good for the item and customer service."
1,Save yourself the misery,"These are by far the worst CDs I have ever had the displeasure of giving to my son, and he's got at least 50+ different software titles. He's been nothing but frustrated with these poorly designed and boring programs.Save your money!! It's unfortunately too late for us."
4,First Friendships Fun Pack Rainbow Fish,Rainbow Fish is delightful. The vivid colors are better than anyother software I have seen. The 8-year-old and 9-year-oldgrandchildren worked together and navigated the entire game. Istill have not made it to the top. Cannot comment on Polar Bearor Oz because the children insist on playing Rainbow Fish.
1,Dissapointing not in Spanish!,I usualy like shows in their original language but flinstones are better in Spanish! even hanna barbera said that it was the best adaptation and the version in spanish goes better with the personalities of the characters.I dont now why they didnt made this one in Spanish.Enrique
1,"false advertising, keep away","Special features are advertised, but there are none. Instead, each disk tells you to ""see other disks for MORE special features."" There are none at all.And only 3 of the 4 disks have pictures. The 4th is blank."
5,Great TV Series,"This was and still is a fun show.***Note- Judging from the other reviews left by the Rockhead who left the Jan.1,2006 review, the only thing that this individual apparently does enjoy is leaving one-star negative reviews for as many items as he/she can fit into their sad life. How pathetic!!!"
2,Legal Secretary's Complete Handbook,"Some helpful information, but it is very dated. My fault, I should have checked the publishing date before I ordered it."
3,legal review,The book's last publication was 1992...it's soooo far behind the times as far as the technology part is concerned. She did not even mention Legal Software that a lot of lawyers use now-a-days...called PRO DOC. SO it's a sort of good reference book if you overlook the date of it and it also being behind the times.
2,"Silly doesn't equal funny,","How can a show that rolls UFO Ultramaiden, Excel Saga, and Azumanga Daioh into one be so unfunny? Don't get me wrong, I like off the wall parodies, but comedy needs a backdrop of reality to work against. This show hangs on the premise of 10 year old girl teaching high school class. Also she has a suicidal pet bunny, there are bad star trek parodies, most of the class act like they are in need a double dose of Ritalin, there is a cat that hides in soda machines & claims to be god...... people do things with no explation, things happen for no know cause, the script is mainly a string of one-liners. Even with the explaining subtitles this is a disjointed mess that goes nowhere"
2,I didn't realize they could swear in G movies?,"Since when is it okay to curse in a movie rated G? We weren't even halfway through the movie and the ""S"" word was dropped (and I do not mean stupid). My 3 and 8 year old were watching it...My 8 year old said ""I think this must be rated PG or PG-13""."
1,Poorly made flash,"This flash may be comparable to its Canon Equivalent in specifications, but it is made very flimsily. The lens fell of the front of the flash and had to be reattached with crazy glue. It flops around on the hot shoe attachment and does not attach firmly."
1,unhappy,"Unit was used once at a wedding, lasted approx 50 shots and stopped working, wouldn't charge up to flash, inspite of several battery changes, both rechargeables and alkaline."
2,You get what you paid for...,"I bought this flash 2 years ago.Pros: Cheap, produces more light than the built-in flash (Canon Rebel XT), good for ceiling bounceCons: TTL never worked it always fires at it's max capacity, so unless you're very far from the object (close to max capacity), the object will be over exposed. I was only able to use it with ceiling bounce as a result. It stopped working after less than 2 years. You'll know that it's cheap when you get it an see how flimsy the structure is."
1,Uncommercial scribbles,"Very poor standard of logo design on the whole. Most of the work featured is quirky and completely uncommercial. If you regularly produce this kind of work then this may be of interest to you as a reference but, for the rest of us, it's nothing more than an insight into the minds of the more idiosyncratic designers out there."
5,Quite Possibly one of the best referance books for young designers.,"This book has all kinds of referance for the younger generation of Graphic Designers. It's a collection of designs that are more street art than classic layout design. However, it collects these peices in order by layout and content. The designs are fascinating and original, but it is possible they will become dated, as they reflect the contemporary design of today, but also rely heavily on the style seen in less mainstream applications. Being a young designer myself, the referances in this book are second to none. Job well done."
3,just... ok.,"i have tons of logo and corporate branding books and was pretty excited when I saw this in the undergroud book shop in the LES. when I got home, i must say though, was a little dissapointed. some are the logos are cool, but most of them are crap. the only thing that makes this book ""ok"" is the amount of logos in it, but even then, many pages of logos all look the same... over and over."
